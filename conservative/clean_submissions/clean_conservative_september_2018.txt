{"author":"MattMeduri","created_utc":1535765901,"num_comments":4,"score":12,"selftext":"So I aired a Senate Map back a few weeks ago. Figured since it's Labor Day and the election season has \"officially\" kicked off, I'd air an updated map. I also believe enough change has occurred that has warranted and update. TL;DR at bottom.\n\n\u200b\n\nFirst off, I'm an amateur political junkie. I called all 50 states in the 2016 Election. I go by national and state environments, incumbency advantage (if any), partisan tilts, approval ratings of incumbents, electoral history, and some polling. Mind you, I take polling with a grain of salt. And you should too...\n\n\u200b\n\nSafe D: The same 14 states that were safe for dems are still safe. In **Delaware**, all available polling as shown Carper under 10% to two hypothetical republicans, assuming he wins the nomination. Not a state to bet on, but keep an eye on in the coming week(s). **Gary Johnson** is expected to throw the **New Mexico** senate race into turmoil, but no evidence shows a party schism just yet.\n\nSafe R: Same 4 Seats are safe\n\nLikely D: Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New Jersey still remain likely to stay with the dems. However, **John James'** upset in the GOP primary for **Michigan** Senate may cause the race to go into a stir. Gov. Snyder (R) is term-limited, and electoral history does not favour a republican to win the governor's mansion. It also shows how Trump's influence played a key here, especially in a state in which his approval rating is claimed to be underwater. More info needs to follow on **New Jersey**, but it may quietly be shaping up to be on of the this year's top Senate Races.\n\nLikely R: Texas and Mississippi - S remain likely to go to republicans.\n\nLean D: I'm reserving changes to **Wisconsin** and **Ohio** for possible developments.\n\nLean R: Marsha Blackburn received more votes for *herself* than the entire democratic turnout in **Tennessee**. I don't think this race is shaping up to be as competitive as they safe, even with Bredesen on the ticket. Still, I rate it at a leans.\n\n**North Dakota** still has a republican tilt, while **West Virginia** has a democratic tilt. More info on these races needs to be unveiled in order to get some better direction.\n\n\u200b\n\n**Ratings Changes:**\n\n1. **Nevada** \\- I previously gave this a \"Tilt\" D status, but have changed it. Dean Heller is holding up very well, and I would not count out his ability to retain this seat. However, a very competitive governor's race (in a state that hasn't elected a democratic governor since the late 1990s) may toss his seat.\n2. **Montana** \\- Previously rated as \"Tilt\" D, I changed it to toss-up, following enthusiasm in the state, a sharp turn to the right from 2012-2016, the Ronny Jackson\/Jon Tester scrap, and a poll showing Matt Rosendale (R) up +2.\n3. **Minnesota - S** \\- I previously gave this a \"Lean D\" status, but I now give Tina Smith (D)\\* the \"Tilt\" rating. I don't see Minnesota not electing a republican to a higher office this year. And given interim Senators' horrible track record with reelections, I would not at all classify her with a \"lean\" rating. **Karin Housley (R)** is female, moderate, a Washington-outsider, and a household name (her husband is a pro-hockey player). Gi**ven Al Fra**nken's stupid stunt in an attempt to set a precedent for Trump to resign, I would laugh if this blew up in their faces.\n\nFeel free to comment below, post your own prediction, agree, disagree, and chat. Please keep it civil!\n\nTL;DR: 3 Ratings Changes all in favour of republicans, Reps still heavily-favoured to keep US Senate.\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/e6071si17jj11.png","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"2018 Midterms - Senate Map Update 8\/31\/18 - Estimate: Net Gain - R +4"}

In addition, the anarchistic upshot of the libertarian doctrine appealed to the countercultural left. For did not the illegitimacy state and the nonaggression axiom (that one shall not initiate or threaten to initiate physical force against others and their property) imply that everyone was at liberty to choose his very own nonaggressive lifestyle?\n\n&gt; Did this not imply that vulgarity, obscenity, profanity, drug use, promiscuity, pornography, prostitution, homosexuality, polygamy, pedophilia or any other conceivable perversity or abnormality, insofar as they were victimless crimes, were no offenses at all but perfectly normal and legitimate activities and lifestyles? Not surprisingly, then, from the outset the libertarian movement attracted an unusually high number of abnormal and perverse followers. Subsequently, the countercultural ambiance and multicultural-relativistic \"tolerance\" of the libertarian movement attracted even greater numbers of misfits, personal or professional failures, or plain losers. Murray Rothbard, in disgust, called them the \"nihilo-libertarians\" and identified them as the \"modal\" (typical and representative) libertarians. They fantasized of a society where everyone would be free to choose and cultivate whatever nonaggressive lifestyle, career, or character he wanted, and where, as a result of free-market economics, everyone could do so on an elevated level of general prosperity.\n\n&gt; Ironically, the movement that had set out to dismantle the state and restore private property and market economics was largely appropriated, and its appearance shaped, by the mental and emotional products of the welfare state: the new class of permanent adolescents.\n\n&gt; This intellectual combination could hardly end happily. Private property capitalism and egalitarian multiculturalism are as unlikely a combination as socialism and cultural conservatism. And in trying to combine what cannot be combined, much of the modem libertarian movement actually contributed to the further erosion of private property rights Gust as much of contemporary conservatism contributed to the erosion of families and traditional morals). What the countercultural libertarians failed to recognize, and what true libertarians cannot emphasize enough, is that the restoration of private property rights and laissez-faire economics implies a sharp and drastic increase in social discrimination and will swiftly eliminate most if not all of the multi-cultural-egalitarian life style experiments so close to the heart of left libertarians. In other words, libertarians must be radical and uncompromising conservatives.","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"Hans-Hermann Hoppe: \"Libertarians must be radical and uncompromising conservatives.\"""num_comments":2,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"There is no barrier between libertarianism and conservatism"}

I believe the time is long over due that the forces of strong political and cultural influence be met with equal political and cultural force.  The conservative movement in the US responded to the socialist threat, and declining moral values in the 60's and 70's at a time, when I would argue, the political climate was far more hostile than it is today.  Assassination was a political tool then, and that era of such severe violence seems to have passed us thank heavens.   A prominant conservative of the time William F. Buckley Jr, responded with intellect and wit to reveal those under the spell of marxism the error of their ways. He too was called a \"Nazi\" as so many with conservative views are today.  He responded with tempered fire making it very clear to his opponent that throwing around such a slur would not he tolerated.   In Australia we're dealing with the same issues as the UK and the United States, and we're overdue to turn the tide, or at the very least create a conservative bulwark against the forces leading Australians by the strings of political correctness.  There are many that have stuck their necks out, many smaller groups forming in private.  It's time for a movement of principle, of truth, a movement that will defend the family.  It's time for the conservative to stand up and raise their voice, and perhaps we won't have to learn the hard way as countless civilisations before us have.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Australian Conservative Movement"}

Or what's to stop them from limiting the posts of anyone is a subscriber to r\/the_donald, r\/againsttrumpspam, or \/r\/ChapoTrapHouse or worse yet banning them?\n\nI know that *technically* this isn't an issue of free speech because reddit is a private company and these hack mods can do what they want. But ultimately I refute the mods seeming implication that free and open speech is incompatible with moderate discussion of politics. I post alot, yes, but users can either ignore my postings, argue against the articles I post, simply downvote them all to hell, or (and this is a big one) ***JUST POST SOME ARTICLES YOURSELVES***\n\nTo the mods you have all shown your true colors and the overt partisan hacks that you are. You do not stand for moderate discussion of issues, and you all actively are attempting to suppress conservative arguments on topics that matter to Americans today. This decision forges a terrible path of suppressing conservative voices and chilling sincere and open discussion in this subreddit and you all are responsible.\n\nI know I should feel shocked that it came to this, but after engaging and studying your overt biases, I am sadly not. Congrats \/u\/kinohki you got your wish\n\nedit: in response to \/u\/LazyGoron \n\n&gt;BUT HOLY FUCKING SHIT - you posted... (where's my abacus) 13 stories in the last 6 hours, a separate 9 within the last day, and another separate 15 two days ago. I am laughing at my desk right now. That's 30 stories in 48-72 hours. If that shit was in my inbox I'd 100% mark you as spam. Let's have some honest objectiveness about what is going on here.\n\nAnd? I *literally read every single one of these articles* isn't that the whole fucking point of this subreddit?\n\nI have literally no point to make other than I want the conservative worldview to be shown on this subreddit as much as the liberal worldview, *as is supposed to be the point of this so called discussion subreddit* \n\nThe issue here is that the mods are frustrated that I post more than anyone else on the liberal side, *because the liberal side is too lazy to invest in this subreddit* And is it my fault? Is it my fault that literally no one else can be  bothered to read an engaging article from WP, Politico, etc... and just post the damn thing on this subreddit?\n\n*Oh no that fucking idiot conservative reads and posts more than other people, he's spamming us! bwaaaa!!!* that is such a ridiculous and more importantly *meritless* thing to complain about.\n\nI'm sorry but the mods have utterly destroyed the ideals of this sub. They're shameless hacks. I pray one day there can be a legitimate subreddit for political discussion, because this isn't it anymore. \n\nGood luck to the conservative lurkers here. and \/u\/RECIPR0C1TY you are no true conservative since you and your fellow hacks spit in the face of the values that made the American experiment beautiful and a light in the darkness.","subreddit":"moderatepolitics","title":"the mods of have decided to create a rule unique only towards myself.""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"the mods of r\/moderatepolitics have decided to create a rule unique only towards myself all because I post conservative articles, and they're calling it spam."}

{"author":"LilWop","created_utc":1536301197,"num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"I hate to break it to the sole heatedly devotional Liberals and Feminists, but \"white male privilege\" is a absolute bull shit.\n\nJust a few stats to break this theory down for you:\n\n18-year-old  women are 35 percent more likely to attend university than 18-year-old  men; and where 37 percent of black school-leavers go to university, only  28 percent of white school-leavers  do. These stats were unveiled by  UCAS in December, leading its chief  executive to wonder if it isn\u2019t  time to initiate \u2018outreach\u2019 projects designed to get more white blokes  into college.\n\nAlso  in December, a YouGov analysis of 48 surveys of public attitudes  found  that young white men are viewed as \u2018the worst ethnic, gender  \\[and\\] age  group\u2019. They are \u2018the most derided ethnic group in Britain\u2019.  YouGov\u2019s  number-crunchers confessed to being surprised by \u2018the lousy  reputation  of young white men\u2019, who are seen as drunken, promiscuous,  prone to  drug-taking, work-shy and impolite (even as other surveys reveal that  today\u2019s youth actually drink less and do fewer drugs than earlier  generations did).\n\nWhat\u2019s  more, young women now earn more than young men: \u00a31,111 a year more, to  be precise. Between the ages of 22 and 29, women in general \u2014 covering  all races \u2014 out-earn guys;  by the time women hit their thirties,  however, their pay falls below  men\u2019s. Those young, opinionated new  media feminists who get handsome  advances to write books spluttering  about \u2018white male privilege\u2019 are far  more privileged than many of the  white males they splutter about \u2014  especially the ones who empty their  bins or sweep their roads. It\u2019s  almost Orwellian in its Topsy-turviness  \u2014 the most well-connected,  middle-class women denouncing the alleged  privileges of some of the most  derided people in society.\n\nSo  this theory is just a myth created by these cancerous feminists to stop  white men from chasing their goals and enjoying life. Ever since I was a  child (only 16) I have been told that us white men are lucky and  privileged, and that we should be ashamed of our past. Well I am afraid,  you can no longer sell me your white lies and propaganda.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCase closed.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"White Male Privilege: A Myth"}

Like many of us, I live in a huge echo chamber--80-90% of my friends on fb are also liberal, so I rarely see or hear conservative viewpoints on current events. One thing my lefty friends are really bad about is attacking straw men--criticizing or even pre-empting counter-arguments to their own political arguments or philosophies. They will criticize supposedly widespread conservative behaviors or arguments. Yet, because most of my social world is liberal, I never *actually* see or hear these arguments where they originated from. For example, I know some people are actually burning Nike apparel, but to my knowledge, none of my conservative friends are. It's currently popular among liberals to make fun of \"all the white people\" for burning Nike gear.\n\nMy question to you is this--how many people are actually burning their Nike gear?

{"author":"tacoeaters4trump","created_utc":1536650390,"num_comments":0,"score":15,"selftext":"How I Became a Republican By @MY\\_Wiltshire\n\nThere\u2019s a certain humility about reflecting on life and identifying the moments that define who we are. Sometimes those are moments we impose on ourselves, for better or worse. I\u2019ve certainly had my fair share of self-inflicted disasters (and a handful of self-made triumphs). But I suspect my life would be radically different had certain events, over which I had zero control, never transpired. This story is actually pretty depressing so don\u2019t read any further unless you\u2019re willing to catch some feels.\n\nThree days before my 11th birthday I sat in my 6th grade pre-algebra class at the Tuxedo Park School in Tuxedo, NY. It was a beautiful Tuesday in September--about 10:45 in the morning. It was our weekly half-hour math class in which we didn\u2019t ever get anything done anyway and I must have been staring out the window at the playground outside. Either that or I was thinking about the snacks provided at recess.\n\nAll of a sudden the Headmaster, came into the room looking a little panicked and whispered something into my math teacher\u2019s ear. At that we were all lining up and being told to go to the theater. Frankly, I think we were all kinda excited because we were getting out of class early.\n\nThat feeling immediately disappeared as we started walking out of the classroom. I was towards the end of the line and my classmates kept turning around to look at me as they passed the threshold of the door. It was a small school (only 18 people in my 6th grade class) and we all knew each other and each other\u2019s families. Directly across the hall was my sister\u2019s 4th grade classroom for which my mother was class parent. When I left the room I walked, to my surprise, directly into my sobbing mother clutching my sister in her arms and repeating \u201che\u2019s okay\u201d over\n\nand over\n\nand over\n\nand over\u2026\n\nI have a pretty clear memory of the entire day except the next few minutes. I remember sitting towards the back of this tiny theater room which had carpet covered risers rather than seats. The Headmaster told us what had transpired: two planes had flown into the World Trade Center and the buildings had just collapsed killing thousands. Every. Single. Head in the room turned to look at me--as I said, it was a small school and everyone knew Mr. Wiltshire worked at Sidley Austin Brown &amp; Wood on the 59th floor of the WTC. I must have started crying uncontrollably because the next thing I remember is my science teacher tapping me on the shoulder and suggesting I step outside where my mother and sister were waiting. I hugged my mother with the crushing feeling that the world had ended.\n\nBack in my classroom I started packing up my things to leave. I was in shock and didn\u2019t know what to say--I asked my math teacher if we had any homework (she smiled, hugged me, and told me not to worry about it). It was silent as a crypt in that room until one of my classmates spoke up and asked, \u201cSo, er, Matt. Is your dad dead?\u201d To the credit of my classmates, they quickly chastised him as an utter moron--a judgement with which I silently concurred. To be honest, I think I remained silent because I didn\u2019t know the answer yet.\n\nWe drove home in silence. You would think that a car-ride would be the the thing I remember least. You\u2019d be wrong. We lived in Saddle River, New Jersey--just south of the New York State border. As you drive south along Route-17 from Tuxedo to Saddle River there is a hill. At the top of that hill you can see for miles and miles on a clear day. It was a very clear day.\n\nLaid out before us was the most horrifying image I have ever seen and I will carry it to my death. On the horizon was Manhattan. It was on fire. Smoke billowed over the entire island. I couldn\u2019t make out any of the iconic landmarks--in part because two of them were no longer there. My mother, who had composed herself by this time, reached the bottom of the hill and pulled to the side of the road overcome with grief.\n\nWe knew my father was alive. He had been unable to reach my mother on her cell phone but had called our home where a construction crew was remodeling the house. Someone from the crew picked up--knowing that on THAT day no call should go unanswered. The construction workers had somehow gotten through to my mother that my dad had called and was okay. It was why she had been muttering \u201che\u2019s okay\u201d when I first saw her. So intellectually we knew not to panic.\n\nEmotionally was an entirely different story. Panic is not rational--it\u2019s a natural, involuntary response. I hope I never experience anything quite so terrifying, but color me pessimistic. I knew my father was alive but I wouldn\u2019t believe it until I touched him with my own two hands.\n\nMy dad says that 9\/11 was like living through his own funeral. The phone rang constantly with people all over the world not knowing what they were going to say. Eventually my mother stopped answering the phone--people just didn\u2019t know how to ask. The phone would ring, my father would answer, and every single caller reacted in the same way: a sigh of relief and then crying. You can see his account of what happened by googling \u201cDaily Cougar Mark Wiltshire.\u201d\n\nThat morning, before any of the subsequent events occurred, my father did something he didn\u2019t normally do. He drove my sister and me to the bus stop behind the Saddle River police station. As a result, he was on the ferry going across the Hudson river when he saw his building get hit. It is because of that ride to the bus that I believe in God--for the second time in my short life my father had narrowly survived a terrorist attack.\n\nThe emotional scars have followed my family for going on two decades. Despite the enormous amount of time I\u2019ve spent in New York City, I have yet to visit the 9\/11 memorial. It\u2019s simply too taxing.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after those events that I decided to learn about the history and politics surrounding that day. I am lucky to have a father with a PhD in Philosophy--he encouraged me to read, think critically, and question what I learned. Over the years I have read everything from Marx to Hayek and developed a philosophy which continues to evolve.\n\nBut I became a Republican due to the 2004 presidential campaign. I saw two worldviews clashing. One ideology said that man is imperfect and that good and evil are real. It argued that we should combat evil wherever it reared its head while recognizing that everything we do will be flawed. The other chose to bury its head in the sand and pretend that evil doesn\u2019t exist but rather unsavory actions are merely a construct of American power. I chose to be on the side that fights those who would do us harm rather than capitulate to their demands.\n\nNow obviously my political philosophy has matured over the years and 13-year-old Matt\u2019s political views were clearly simplistic. I\u2019ve now had more years of my life with politics being of interest to me than years without. But if anything those years have reinforced the conclusion that I made as a child: Republicans will face problems head-on while Democrats will make excuses and play word games to hide themselves and their constituents from the realities of the world. Obama may have ordered thousands of missile strikes but he avoided using the word \u201cterrorism\u201d like it would apply some voodoo curse on him.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that my experience since becoming a Z-list conservative activist has been one marked by combat with activists on the other side who see my minor influence as a threat. As such, they have used their influence to mark me as a bigot simply because I am willing to publicly and honestly discuss the things that made me who I am. I recently found out that, among certain groups, I\u2019m referred to as \u201cthe guy who hates Muslims.\u201d That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I choose my friends and if that were the case there are a dozen people who I never would have acquainted myself with, let alone consider them to be among those nearest and dearest to my heart. These vitriolic attacks by those who are threatened by my conservatism are, at best, made by those who don\u2019t know better and, at worst, by cowards.

I'm only 23 years old and just graduated university, I had my dream job, friends, a great apartment....and now for the past 8 months I've been bedridden all alone at my parents house. I just want to know what the hell is wrong with me. I've seen multiple specialists, doctors, ERs and I've had countless tests done...but nothing. Please help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**History:**\n\nIn June 2016 I had a sudden attack of stomach pain that lasted about a week. I could barely walk because it was so painful, I called a non emergency number and they didn't seem concerned. It went away after a week and I was fine for a little while, only for this pain to keep coming back for week long periods. I felt like I might be constipated but nothing really helped. I should mention here that I lost 100 pounds from April 2016-April 2017 through counting calories.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese pain attacks continued, and by January 2017 it was daily. The pain mostly appeared at night. My intestines felt raw in a band above my bellybutton and I had nonstop gas that wouldn't be relieved whatsoever. I was hospitalized for severe dehydration for a week in October 2016.  I graduated in April 2017 and got my first adult job and it was severely impacting my performance, by 3pm I would be incredibly bloated and in so much pain. I tried the FODMAP diet, Celiac diet, keto, no fat etc etc. I tried anti inflammatory drugs, probiotics, things like gas x etc...but nothing. I ended up missing so much work because of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy October 2017 I found that the pain would increase with each meal, I would start the day out ok but with each meal the pain got worse and worse. After dinner the pain just would not relent.\\*\\*I also had trouble drinking fluids, as it only made the pain worse\\*\\*. The pain would radiate to my back and I would experience extreme pain\/weakness in my limbs, along with coldness in my affected hand\/foot. By January 2017 the pain was so bad I could no longer walk and my parents had to come get me and bring me home.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Current:**\n\nSince January 2017 my pain has been getting significantly worse. The pain is mostly on the right upper side of my abdomen, near my rib area. It's a constant pain and is made worse by sitting up straight and with food. I feel extreme swelling in this area and it feels like something is going to explode, or my ribs are going to break. On the right side I also have a pain lower down, near my hip. It's an extremely sharp pain. When I eat I have pain in my upper abdomen above my bellybutton between my ribs, it feels like I swallowed glass and I always feel like I ate a 3 course meal at night...even if I don't eat anything. Theres a pain that makes a lap across my stomach above my bellybutton...it feels like my intestines are raw and like I'm a pumpkin that someone is scraping. I also have lower intestinal pain from gas. If I press down on the areas I do not have pain (other than gas), but sitting up straight and walking makes it so much worse. When I sit up it's like everything get's trapped and I swell really badly. When I say makes it worse, for example I had to go 6 hours in a car to see a doctor and the pain was significantly worse for days and days on end. Anything I do that could make it worse will make it worse for days, to the point I'm in tears in a ball.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can pretty much only eat carbs, I live off of bread...it's been 8 months of bread. Fruits\/ veggies\/ proteins make the pain SO significant. I'm in pain if I eat bread as well, but compared to other things it's not as bad. I'm also sometimes alright with junk food that has no nutritional value (I know...). I have to eat very small meals, because I could be full painfully for 8 hours or until I fall asleep. I also have trouble with fluids, water causes significant pain and makes me start gagging. I've found I can take small sips of diet ginger ale throughout the day, I get dehydrated easily obviously. I had to have an MRI a few days ago and had to drink a litre for it, I couldn't even drink half and I was crying for the next 3 days in pain. When the pain in my abdomen gets worse, my limbs also \"go\". It started out with just a leg that I thought was sciatica...but it's not. I can't describe this pain, but it's extreme and also like numbness...but I can still feel everything? My foot goes cold and my muscles become weak. This can happen to both legs, it's usually just the right. The same pain can happen in my arms, frequently my right leg and right arm go at the same time, but it can move to different limbs quickly. I get ulcers inside my mouth all the time as well. Just in the past two months my stomach pain has started to go up my esophagus and into my throat, it feels like when you're really frustrated and get a lump in your throat but all over? It hurts to breathe and it feels very constricting, this is paired with my awful night pain. It also goes in the right side of my chest. I can't go out because it's too painful, I just lay down...for 8 months. I go out for doctors appointments but thats it. I also can't go to the bathroom which is great. If left on my own I'll have a small BM every 3 weeks. I feel like I'm about to have diarrhea pretty much 24\/7. My specialist has me on daily glycerin suppositories. I'm also almost always nauseous and puke in my mouth when I lay down.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've seen so many doctors and specialists. It was brushed off as IBS for a while until it got really bad. I'm sure you'll think I'm nuts while reading this, trust me I've heard it all, I'm not crazy. My GP initially thought I was nuts and had me on a LOT of anti anxiety meds, but my specialists told me to go off of it because it's not in my head and was making the situation worse. I'm currently seeing two GIs but they have no idea whats up, and it's Canada so it's months between appointments. I saw an endocrinologist as well but nothing was wrong there. I have a history of endometriosis in my family so I was send to a gyno, all clear there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI so desperately just want my life back. I'm all alone and I have no one. I want my job back. I want my friends back. I want food back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Here is a bad diagram of where the pain is**\n\nPain 1: [https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/m6CidBM.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/m6CidBM.jpg) Pain 2: [https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KykCWBw.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KykCWBw.jpg) Pain 3: [https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hgDE64S.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/hgDE64S.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are my test results, if you need to know anything I have them in front of me\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Endoscopy**: Ulcers on duodenum.

Was put on domperidone...no help, just made my body constantly spasm.\n\n**Allergist**: No food allergies, severe reactions to environmental things on skin prick tests.\n\n**Endocrinologist**: Was sent because my arm cortisol was 700. My urine cortisol was normal. They didn't suspect anything (such as cushings)\n\n**CT:** Normal\n\n**Ultrasound:** Pancreas not well visualized due to gas, small free fluid in right posterior pelvis, left kidney demonstrates mild renal pelvis fullness.\n\n**MRI:** Normal.\n\n**BW:** all normal (CBC, Cr, Liver enz, AIC, TSH, Ferritin)\n\n**HIDA scan:** Non specific generalized hepatocyte dysfunction, delayed bilary to small bowel transit time.\n\n**Surgeon:** Doesn't think taking gallbladder out would help, but willing to try.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll other blood tests are coming back normal. I'm just starting to get into the weird stuff such as Porphyria. I'm so frustrated, my heart breaks every time a test comes back with nothing\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas? ANYTHING.

During his stay here, he met a girl that he convinced to get married for the sole purpose of getting his papers. They got married and filed for papers. \n\nThat couple have never lived together, nor have a lease in both of their names.  They barely have a few pictures here and there but nothing with family and friends. \n\n\nNow, when they got their interview, I was sure that they will get busted since everything seems like a red flag. Anyways, I just found out he got his green card and he is on his way to be a US citizen. \n\nDuring that time, I have worked, lived and hung out with him. He\u2019s been nothing but scamming people out of anything he can get. \n\nIs there a way for me to tell Immigration about his case, or is it a lost cause. Is there a hot line I can call or an email.

If anyone has issues with this being  posted here, I'll remove it. ........\n\nI'm a college student at a Uni in California, working to my Masters in Psychology.  I generally hold a conservative view on things.\n\nThis year, I've taken a \"Human Sexuality\" class that is required for me to take.\n\nMy professor has done very little teaching about content in the book.  That isn't always bad, but I'm not really learning anything at all from  this professor. He constantly talks about politics, or transgender  people and the sexuality surrounding people that are transgender. So far  we have had nothing else.\n\nBut my issue is, Our \"homework\" or \"quiz's\" Which most of our grade  is based on, aren't based on the book or what is taught in the class. In  fact, they tend to be more like questionnaires.\n\nThey ask questions like, Our sexual experiences, Sexual preferences,  Sexual identification, Political affiliation, Parents political  affiliation, political affliction when we were younger, questions about  our upbringing, etc etc etc.\n\nI could go on about all the personal questions these tests involve  but I think you get the idea. These questions aren't anonymous either,  obviously since we have to write our names to get credit for the paper.\n\nWe have no choice in doing these. If we refuse, he will fail us.\n\nI expected to learn about transgenders, but also about other things  regarding human sexuality.  I have a strong guess that he is using all this information for his  \"research\" whatever he may be working on. Which he will most likely  publish. I do not know if the published results will be anonymous or not, since  he hasn't told us what he is collecting all the data for.\n\nI don't really feel comfortable giving all this information, even  more so since I'm not liberal and I'm going to an \"woke\" or  Liberal Uni. But I do not have a choice in the matter.\n\nI usually don't have an issue with the liberal agenda finding its way  into my studies, because I do tend to take online classes which tend to  me more conservative in their views and it helps balance out the  subject matter.  But In this class, I'm wasting my money and my time. I'm not learning  anything new, and I don't really care to hear about the subjective views  of my teacher and the transgender people he invites to speak to the  class.\n\nThe question:  Can he collect this data without telling us, is it okay for him to do  this? If no, who should i bring this up with or what should I do?","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Liberal Professor collecting personal data instead of teaching."}

Men are afraid of false accusations. And I think they have a point, because if you don't bring rape authoritatively, people won't react. Modern feminism brought rape *too much* authoritatively, but point remains. Feminists even told me that social risks of rape should never be discussed, only \"*woman is always innocent\"* and that's it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConsidering the fact that I was sexually abused by my family and support freedom of speech, unlike an acting faction of feminist liberals, I assume that people have right to invalidate my abuse claims and tell me \"it was my fault\". This means people also have the right to invalidate my mental health and depression, because \"it is in my head\". And also, people have a right to call me my birth name and \"he\", even after I complete legal name and sex change, because freedom of speech. I was told personally that asking to use the right pronoun is a violation of 1st amendment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI support any pronoun, but I don't support government enforcing those pronouns because I think pronouns can change and are eventually up to their holder to decide. \n\nAm I being a hypocrite for wanting help for my child sexual abuse and gender, but also supporting freedom of speech?\n\nMy personal thought on this is: I don't think that personal beliefs of people should be abridged by their gender identity or a traumatic past. A black Muslim trans lesbian non-binary AFAB rape survivor can be pro-guns and pro-Trump if xe wants to, for example. But the world is way too identity-political for such person to exist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut on the other hand, personally attacking someone may not be freedom of speech, not even hate speech. \"Hate speech\" is vague because it requires a group of people to be offended. On the other hand, personal attacks, which may include purposeful misgenderings, exist factually. To an extreme, for example: libel is not freedom of speech or even hate speech for that matter. However one has to know that purposeful misgenderings are just a form of harassment and shouldn't get people sent to extremes, like jail. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust my thoughts.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Can a child sexual abuse survivor be a conservative, or a libertarian at least?

Seeing a self-styled billionaire president of the people VS a stoic army veteran's unrelenting investigation is pretty exciting. The overly emotional portrayal of it (from both sides) adds a lot of drama to it. It's a lot like a soap opera to me.\n\nAnyway, I see a lot of material from left-wing or left-leaning sources, which makes sense considering the fundamental shift of American society. However, I like to get both sides of the argument.\n\nSo my question to this sub is, is there a source of conservative news that isn't just insane and crazy preaching\/ranting like FOX? I tried to watch FOX, but some of the bullshit they come out with and their ranting is, frankly, painful.\n\nAre there any other conservative news sources in America which are more normal?\n\nFor what it's worth, I don't care about American politicians from either side, I think the vast majority of American politicians are corrupt and act for their own interests, not the American people's.\n\nI think a society needs both left and right wing elements to maintain a healthy balance of progress and stability.

My beef is with the set-up itself. \n\nNHS mental healthcare is a complete shambles in 2018. I don't think I'm being hyperbolic. Almost every service will avoid taking responsibility and refer you somewhere else in a sweeping, almost beautiful, Kafkaesque loop. Doctor says to call the crisis line. Crisis line says go to A&amp;E. A&amp;E says go home and call the crisis line if things get worse. Crisis line says book a doctor\u2019s appointment. \u2018Download an app and go for a jog\u2019 is still not good enough. 6-12 month waiting list for a professional chat is not good enough. Relying on charities is not good enough. Having to separately tell 40+ people the same symptoms over a decade is not good enough.  \n\nThere are no resources for treatment the first, fifth or tenth time you go to the doctor\u2019s because you seem pretty put together and so are not a priority. If you \u2018present\u2019 well you obviously don\u2019t need urgent help, so there\u2019s a disincentive to conduct yourself with dignity - *the system rewards you for breaking down* and funnels you down the path of getting worse until you\u2019re difficult to ignore. Ie the stupidest fucking arrangement to ensure the service is panicky &amp; reactive and uses the most possible resources rather than calm &amp; preventative. How many struggling people are burdens on the service because they couldn\u2019t get treatment for several years and therefore slowly slid from OK to atrocious?  It\u2019s not so much people slipping through the cracks as them standing over a gaping chasm over which nobody\u2019s put any flooring.\n\n Fund the NHS and start the mental health service from scratch, because although lots of people are dedicated\/lovely, the apparatus is completely abortive and broken.

{"author":"RetroChicano","created_utc":1537303396,"num_comments":21,"score":81,"selftext":"Hello everyone! A little background about me I'm a very brown Latino who views himself as a full American (born and raised). I also attend one of the most left leaning universities in the world and only decided to attend mainly due to its high ranking on the global stage. I'm a practicing Catholic Conservative and I just wanted to share my story within the past two years.\n\nI started attending my university last year (which shall be unnamed for privacy concerns.) Prior to attending I had always viewed myself as a Moderate Democrat, I guess mainly cause that's how my family was. I voted 3rd party simply cause I couldn't trust Hillary and I was brain washed into thinking Trump was a bigot. \n\nI'm a political science major and I quickly noticed how biased the department was, we often read Marx and the professors were advocates of socialism. At first I wasn't too bothered cause I knew my professors possessed my knowledge than me.\n\nWe also had to take some gen ed classes to which I took a Portuguese culture class. This class was the most leftist class I've ever attended, it painted a narrative about how Portugal was a sexist, homophobic, and racist society due to its Catholicism and generally conservative population. It also promoted abortion through a lecture or at least attempted to dehumanize it.\n\nIt wasn't until Ben Shapiro was scheduled to speak here at the university that I realized I was a sheep to the leftist narrative. All my colleagues and some professors had painted him as an alt right figure who simply hates poors and minorities. This personally made me not want to buy a ticket especially since I knew nothing about him. \n\nI decided to watch the live stream of him however, and realized he was a Jew (disproving him to be a nazi). I also agreed with many of his points and this truly pushed me to look into more videos of his and discover other figures such as Micheal Knowles, Steven Crowder, and Jordan Peterson. Ben Shapiro also helped me find my faith in God and I started attending church shortly after. \n\nBy the end of that first year I was a registered Republican and classified myself as a conservative. I had an issue however, I didn't have a place to live but my friend told me to apply to this house which offered extremely low rent compared to other places. I was hesitant due  to it being a social justice house and I wouldn't be able to relate with anyone but I needed a place to stay so I applied.\n\nInitially I was rejected simply because I didn't meet any of their requirements: I wasn't undocumented, or low income (I'm middle class but on the lower side),  I am not a women nor am I gay which goes against their mission statement of \"helping the oppressed\". Apparently my friend had pulled some strings and I was able to join the cohort. (This application proved to me how leftist don't want equality)\n\nHonestly I get along with a few people here yet these workshops that we are required to attend are major leftist propaganda sessions. I've noticed there are a quite few people who dislike white people regardless of their character (I try my best not to talk to them). I've also noticed how the house tries to boast diversity yet there isn't a single white person in the house. Most people assume I'm a Democrat simply cause I'm a super brown fellow. I also don't talk about politics with my peers since I know that will start arguments.\n\nThe main issue is that I haven't told anyone I'm conservative, I'm afraid that if I do I would be immediately hated by my own peers and perhaps some family. I just decided to keep my head down, read conservative literature, watch podcast, then hopefully one day in the future I can become a conservative politician to maintain our freedom and morality.\n\n\nMy advice for anyone who read this, we may have to silence ourselves due to peer pressure but don't feel hopeless, just do what you need to get by and hope to make a difference later in the future.\n\nTLDR: was Democrat, attending leftist university, became conservative thanks to Ben Shapiro, registered Republican, now I live a leftist house and I have to hide my conservatism to get by to make change in the near future. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I'm a Conservative and I live in a \"social justice\" house and attend a hyper liberal university.

{"author":"MattMeduri","created_utc":1537405339,"num_comments":12,"score":13,"selftext":"**TL;DR at bottom**\n\nNew York (my home state) just held its primaries for state-level offices. In other words, campaign season has finally kicked off.  I'm a political junkie. I called all 50 states in the 2016 Election. I go by national and state environments, incumbency advantage (if any), partisan tilts, approval ratings of incumbents, electoral history, and some polling. Mind you, I take polling with a grain of salt. And you should too...\n\n**Safe R: ID, WY, SD, NE, TX, AR, AL, SC, MA, VT**\n\n* **Vermont: Phil Scott\\* (R)**  is safe on account of **Christine Halquist (D),** a transgender candidate, winning the democratic nomination. He's also hugely popular, and history shows incumbents in Vermont winning reelection a majority of the time.\n\n**Safe D: California and Hawaii**\n\n* **California: Gavin Newsom (D)** was founded leading Trump-backed **John Cox (R)** by just **FIVE** percentage points in a recent poll. This is a wide gap that's been closed, but we'll see if that persists. Keeping Cali safe for now.\n\n**Likely R: Oklahoma, Georgia, Tennessee, Maryland.**\n\n* As unpopular as **Mary Fallin\\* (R-OK)** is, and as tight as the **Georgia** race is shaping up to be, the states still have strong partisan tilts that may insulate the republican candidates from those environments.\n\n**Likely D: New York and Pennsylvania**\n\n* **New York:** I'm from New York, and **Andrew Cuomo\\* (D)** is largely unpopular among people who basically don't live in the city and aren't extremely liberal. He saw a 9 point decrease in his victory in 2014 from his initial win 2010. NY also doesn't have term limits. He's favourited, mainly because of NYC, but he's in no way safe. His crooked administration and further running of the state into debt have not put him on good terms with Upstate and Long Island.\n\n**Leans R: Kansas, New Hampshire, Arizona**\n\n* **Kansas:** While **Kris Kobach (R)** is seen as too far to the right, and with the loss of **Jeff Colyer\\* (R)**, this is a competitive race. We knew this was going to be competitive from the off. Still, the state has a partisan tilt.\n\n**Leans D: Oregon, Rhode Island**\n\n* Both states feature incumbents with middling approval ratings. **Gina Raimondo\\* (D-RI)** has killed the economy in her state, while **Kate Brown (D-OR)** has gained notoriety from not actually listening to her constituents, all while using her platform to elevate herself as a left-wing celebrity, and taking bribes from George Soros 3 days before she declined to send the National Guard to the border. Washington-outsiders are running against both incumbents. Partisan tilts keep democrats favoured, but competition can spur instantly.\n\n**Tilts R: Iowa and Wisconsin**\n\n* Both are Rust Belt states Trump carried in 2016. **Iowa** is slightly to the right of the national centre, while **Wisconsin** is close to the eye of the storm this year. Both races are essential toss-ups, but incumbency advantage for **Scott Walker\\* (R-WI)** is just that - an advantage.\n\n**Tilt D: Colorado, Minnesota**\n\n* Both are states slightly left of the national centre; **Minnesota** is in the eye of the hurricane this year. Neither state has an incumbency advantage.\n\n**Toss-Ups: Nevada, Ohio, Florida, Connecticut**\n\n* All states have potential for party holds and flips. Equal possibility for both. Senate races in the first three could impact gubernatorial elections this season.\n\n**R Flips: Alaska**\n\n* Right now, this is the only state that I can comfortably see republicans flipping. **Bill Walker\\* (I)** is vulnerable in that he's not popular, his running mate is a democrat, and the state doesn't have much of a democratic base. **Former Senator Mark Begich (D)** is running in a 3-way race, likely to split the vote.\n\n**D Flips: New Mexico, Illinois, Michigan, Maine**\n\n* Democrats look best poised to flip **Illinois and Michigan. Bruce Rauner\\* (R-IL)** is unpopular in a state that also cut ties with its most recent republican Senator, **Mark Kirk.**\n* In **Michigan,** history does not favour **Bill Schuette (R).** According to electoral history, Michigan does not usually elect governors of the same party three times consecutively. **Rick Snyder\\* (R)** is also not the most popular governor, absorbing a lot of controversy from the Flint Water Crisis.\n* In **New Mexico**, **Susanna Martinez\\* (R)** is term-limited and has middling approval ratings. Two House Reps are running against each other in a state that has a partisan tilt to the left.\n* In **Maine**, **Paul LePage\\* (R)** is not popular and is somewhat controversial. He's also term-limited. Maine is about to try out this new thing called rank-choice voting, for the first - and probably last - time. Voters rank their choice in candidate in order of preference. When a candidate is mathematically eliminated, the next ranking candidate absorbs those votes. This race will not likely be called on Election Night. (That's the really really *really* broad version of it). I can't say exactly where this is going, and without polling, the only wisdom I can apply here is that LePage is controversial. Democratic Tilt.\n\n**In Conclusion...**\n\n* **Democrats Flip New Mexico, Michigan, Illinois, Maine**\n* **Republicans Flip Alaska**\n* **4 Dead Heat Toss-Ups: Nevada, Florida, Ohio, Connecticut.**\n* **Altogether, 9 essential Toss-Ups: NV, FL, OH, CT, MN, CO, ME, IA, WI**\n\n**Ratings Changes from Last Map (8\/8\/18)**\n\n* **Maryland** goes from LEANS to LIKELY Republican\n* **Arizona** goes from LIKELY to LEANS Republican\n* **Alaska** goes from TILTS to LEANS Republican\n* **New Mexico** goes from TILTS to LEANS Democrat\n* **Maine** goes from LEANS to TILTS Democrat\n* **Iowa** goes from LEANS to TILTS Republican\n* **Wisconsin** goes from LEANS to TILTS Republican\n* **Minnesota** goes from TOSSUP to TILTS Democrat\n\nFeel free to comment below, post your own prediction, agree, disagree, and chat. Please keep it civil!\n\n**TL;DR**  \\- Ratings changes benefit both parties, dems are favoured to have at least a **4 seat net gain.**\n\n**EDIT: New Hampshire should have been LIKELY republican, not LEANS.** Either way, republicans are favoured to hold that seat.\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/ibun1py1man11.png","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Midterms 2018 - Post-Labour Day Governor Map (9\/19\/18) - D+4 Net Gain"}

I. Not talking about those of us engaged and responsible folks; rather, I am talking about the conservative masses bc let's face it, those of us die hards and responsible voters aren't what wins elections. This goes for both sides. \n\nI am concerned about complacency of the conservative masses and the media exposure and enthusiasm of the left. Couple that with the fact that something like 92% of the time mid terms flip Congress (especially house) and it bothers me. Perhaps it is my area (SW Virginia) but I have literally seen nothing at all from our conservative candidates other than a few signs here and there but the Democratic candidates are really getting out there with commercials, campaigns, rallies, door to doors, etc. \n\nAm I the only one who feels this way? I mean the economy is better than I can remember, we have more jobs than people it seems, middle class is doing well (in fact all levels are)..we should be fighting to keep this for obvious reasons and the left doesn't give one shit about any of this...they just want to hurt Trump and Republicans in general. (As usual).\n\nI am not underestimating the motivation the left has at this point but I feel a lot of people are. Propaganda is a powerful thing . I am not on their side at all, but observing what is clear as day. Not sure what we can do about it, but was curious what everyone else thinks.

It's dirty politics and they are much better at it than we are.  Here is why I think we can't win this:\n\n1. If Ford testifies, she will reiterate the same story she has told and Democrats on the committee will use their time to talk about how courageous she is and how women should always be believed.\n\n2. Any time a question is posed to Ford, Democrats on the panel are likely to object and say that the Republicans are showing how they don't care about women and that they are mistreating a survivor of sexual assault.\n\n3. The media will follow at night and present any questions to Ford from Republicans as being from men who are trying to silence a victim.\n\n4. Given what we already know about her statement, there is no way for Kavanaugh to refute any of what Ford has alleged other than by saying it's not true. Democrats will pounce and say that he is not fit to sit in judgement because he doesn't take women's issues seriously and is an abuser himself.\n\n5. After the hearing, Democrats are going to say that Ford has more than been a credible witness and that Kavanaugh should be immediately disqualified based on her testimony. If Republicans continue with the confirmation, Democrats and their willing partners in the media will begin a campaign calling Republicans insensitive to victims of assault and that they hate women.\n\n6. Republicans continue and confirm Kavanaugh, it strengthens Democrats in the mid-terms and we lose the House and Senate.\n\n7. A scenario I think is a possibility, Ford shows up to testify and is allowed to read an opening statement. At the end of her statement she says she has nothing further to add and will not take questions from the committee because she knows it is not going to be a fair process and as a woman who is a victim, she will not be heard and she won't be subjected to that abuse. Democrats applaud her as a hero as well as the media.\n\nCan someone talk me off this ledge? I think it looks pretty bleak. I know some of you here are pretty well connected and follow this much more closely so tell me how we come out on top here.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Someone Talk Me Off the Ledge"}

Oh is not certain of the identity of the female student. Ramirez told her mother and sister about an upsetting incident at the time, but did not describe the details to either due to her embarrassment.\n\nDid Oh know the identity of the Male student. They don't explicitly state that he did, but they also don't explicitly state that he didn't. But that they explicitly say \"Oh is not certain of the identity of the female student.\" seems to suggest that he was certain of the Male's.\n\n&gt;Mark Krasberg, an assistant professor of neurosurgery at the University of New Mexico who was also a member of Kavanaugh and Ramirez\u2019s class at Yale, said Kavanaugh\u2019s college behavior had become a topic of discussion among former Yale students soon after Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination. In one e-mail that Krasberg received in September, the classmate who recalled hearing about the incident with Ramirez alluded to the allegation and wrote that it \u201cwould qualify as a sexual assault,\u201d he speculated, \u201cif it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nOkay, did the classmate hear about the incident in September of 2018 or in the 1980s? That it has not been made explicitly clear is quite suspicious to me. They also conveniently do not name the person who made this claim and skirt the issue by naming the email receiver not the sender.\n\nDoes anyone agree with what I'm saying or am I missing something?","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The New Yorker Article: Ambiguous statements"}

This is a man, who by all accounts but one (now three), is an upstanding man of great moral character and has been so for the entirety of his life.  As a Republican and a Constitutional Conservative, I am appalled by the tactics being used by Democrats in the Senate and what is now being reported by news outlets that even more \"witnesses\" are coming forward with sexual assault allegations, with seemingly no evidence and no witnesses to support their claims.\n\nI feel the need to tell you what I am seeing online and, I have to be blunt, I believe the new allegations should be laid at your feet.  Online, I am apart of several conservative groups.  Since the initial allegation happened, I saw people in support of Senate Republicans.  This took a turn since this last Friday, when you decided to extend the deadline for her answer again even though you had said you and the Judiciary Committee would move to vote if she did not meet it, in what looked like a cowardly decision on your part.  My assessment may be wrong, but the optics of the event (something about trombones and conductors) looked to me and everyone on the 150K member to be that of a lack of fortitude.  Now, two days later, a stream of clearly not credible allegations (no witnesses and an apparent illicit event planned by Kavanaugh) have surfaced making it even harder to confirm him.  The reason for these new allegations are the result of your weakness.  Not every accuser needs to be believed, not every allegation, especially one where the accuser cannot remember the date, location, or even the number of people who were at this supposed \"party\".  You set a deadline, the deadline came and went, and you caved.  \n\nI want ask you to make this right, not only to the people who elect you, but to Brett Kavanaugh.  Because of your weakness in the face of adversity, it is not your reputation, but HIS reputation is being destroyed with the worst allegations possible.  It is impossible as a Republican and Conservative to not see you at least hold some of the blame for this slander to continue and increase.\n\nAs a final statement, I pray that you find a solution to this confirmation that confirms him before midterms because based on myself and what I am hearing from others, Republican voters are being unmotivated by congress' in-action to stand their ground.    There is no reason for us to vote for you when you will not fight for the policies or values that we believe are worth fighting for.  This is the only reason for us to elect representatives.  There is no reason to vote for you, if you allow a man's name and reputation to be destroyed under the guise of \"Social Justice\" by Democrats.  If they are the ones who are pulling all the levers, then our vote on you is clearly wasted  seeing as you wont perform the essential duties of being \"representatives\" by deferring your leadership to another party who does not share the values and policies of those who elected you.  I know that being a [removed], I cannot speak on behalf of your district, but seeing as you have an \"R\" next to your name, I am confident that I and your district at least want similar polices, as opposed to those who are Democrat.\n\nI pray to God that you and your fellow Senate Republicans find the strength and courage.  If you do not, I fear that we will be seeing a relativist court, who blatantly rejects the constitution, and a Democrat congress.\n\nGod Bless,\n\n[removed]","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Letter to Senator Grassley"}

{"author":"MattMeduri","created_utc":1537818303,"num_comments":12,"score":6,"selftext":"So I recently aired my first Post-Labour Day Senate and Gubernatorial Maps, and people seemed to have some thoughts on them. We know Republicans are poised to keep the Senate, while Democrats are expected to make gains on the governor's map. The real question has been the House of Representatives. Republicans really screwed the pooch in a few districts. Combine that with the re-districted Pennsylvania map and a conflicting political environment, anything can happen.\n\nI'm a political junkie. I called all 50 states in the 2016 Election. I go by national and state environments, incumbency advantage (if any), partisan tilts, approval ratings of incumbents, electoral history, and some polling. Mind you, I take polling with a grain of salt. And you should too...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI won't post every race obviously, but if there are races that you're concerned or curious about, **please ask down below and I'll respond with my logic on why I give it that rating.**\n\n**Safe R: 174**\n\n**Safe D: 180**\n\n**Likely R: 20**\n\n**Likely D: 8**\n\n**Lean R: 14**\n\n**Lean D: 11**\n\n**Tilt R: 4 (MN-08, VA-02, FL-26, NY-19)**\n\n**Tilt D: 5 (AZ-02, TX-23, MN-07, PA-01, PA-17)**\n\n**Toss-Up: 19 (CA-10, CA-25, CA-39, CA-48, CA-45, CO-06, IA-01, KS-02, MN-01, MN-02, MN-03, NH-01, NJ-03, NJ-07, NC-09, OH-01, TX-10, TX-32, WA-08)**\n\n**Current D FLIPS: 12 (CA-49, TX-23, FL-27, IL-06, MI-11, VA-10, NJ-02, NJ-11, PA-17, PA-06, AZ-02)**\n\n**Current R Flips: 2 (MN-08, PA-14)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI technically count the tilt districts as toss-ups, so altogether, we have 28 Toss-up Districts, while we have 25 \"Leans\" districts.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Noteworthy Races:**\n\n* I rate **Oregon CD-04 and 05 as LIKELY only because of Clinton's minuscule victories there (0.1% and 4.2% respectively).** I don't think they'll be as competitive as the rest of the seats, if they're competitive at all, but it's merely just a little note at this point, that safely democratic districts were carried so thinly by Clinton in 2016. RCP has the fourth district in their LIKELY column, but we'll take it with a grain of salt.\n* **Connecticut CD-05:** The most republican part of the state. Mix that with an incumbent (**Elizabeth Esty)** who resigned in scandal and embarrassment, as well as a tight governor's race to fill America's most unpopular democrat \\[governor\\], this *could* turn into a race, but at this point, it's not the likeliest bet for republicans.\n* **MINNESOTA.** Minnesota really is in the eye of the hurricane this cycle. Not only are **five out of the eight** House districts competitive this year, but there's also an incredibly contentious **Senate Special Election** and a retiring **governor.** Minnesota democrats who usually be shoe-ins for reelection are now finding themselves trying to get votes out of districts who **voted for Trump by double-digit margins.** All of the vulnerable democrats in MN this year represents districts the President carried by at least **15 points.** In the case of the 7th district, where Trump won by 30.8%, **it is the largest margin of victory the President scored in a district not represented by a republican.** That is why it is a tilt here, when other pundits rate it as LEANS or even LIKELY Democrat. Trump also ran the best race in this state since the last time a republican won it - **1972. Minnesota is the only state to have survived both Reagan landslides.**\n* **Pennsylvania:** Due to redistricting, democrats see a chance to shrink the current 12-6 republican majority to a **10-8**, balance it at a **9-9**, or flip it to a **10-8 of their own. Conor Lamb (D-CD14)** is running in the newly-redrawn 17th district, where **Keith Rothfus\\* (R)** is seen as vulnerable. Lamb would not be able to win the new 14th District, due to its heavily-republican tilt.\n* The only states **without** any real groundbreaking races are: **Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, Alaska, Hawaii, North Dakota, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee, Indiana, Massachusetts, Vermont, Rhode Island, Delaware, and Maryland.** Some of these states have LIKELY ratings (by my standards at least), but I don't think they'll live up to the national profiles of the other races.\n\n**Right now I give republicans a 213 edge, while democrats are close behind at 203.** Either way, democrats look auspicious to get their necks above 200 seats this cycle.\n\nThis cycle is especially crucial, as this is coincides with 35 governor races, the last midterm year before a census year. The parties need to control what they can now before redistricting.

{"author":"shelzmike","created_utc":1537854971,"num_comments":3,"score":13,"selftext":"Well, I should say, just really changed to the human aspect of all of this. I said human aspect, so clearly not talking about the Dems. Sure, I have been damn near speechless at the typical and expected smearing that has been going on. I was suspect from the get go and my views now are even more solidified in that regard. I have also been pissed at what they are doing to someone who has been an upstanding citizen and public servant according to nearly everyone that has known him. \n\nWhat I mean in my title is that it is this second part, I think, that has me the most heated now. When I was rewatching his speech again a little while ago, he seems determined, yet tired..steadfast, but sad. Honestly, who can blame him? A part that was especially impactful that I didn't notice the first time is when he was talking about what he was about in school. He talked about he wasn't even part of that scene really because he was trying to be first in his class, going to church, being a good friend, captain of the varsity basketball team and in doing so, I noticed a slight catch in his voice. Almost as if he was going to get choked up (but was damn strong enough to fight it and move forward stoically). It was at this moment that I 100% believed him. I'm not saying something messed up didn't happen to Ford, but I am sure it wasn't him, no doubt in the slightest. I get we haven't heard her side yet, but come on, there are no details nor corroborating witnesses, so what else could be said? \n\nHe just seemed so genuine and truthful and..pained. if this were true, I have no doubt the person he is now would have bowed out to protect his family and himself from all of this. For all accounts, he was a really decent kid in high school, not something that can be said about a sad majority of people. He was driven and had goals and was putting in the work to reach them. One can say he did indeed reach those goals (and hopefully isn't done yet); however, imagine...all of that..doing the right thing in life and by and for people just to have the Dems pull this crap. That is damn near unforgivable, politics or not. Just to be in this situation and not go off the rails really exemplifies his character because I don't know if I could do it, that's for sure. In fact, I know I couldn't. Now, don't get it wrong when I say this, as I am in no way shape or form comparing Kavanaugh to Jesus, but this feels very similar to a modern day crucifixion. I just pray the GOP won't turn out to be a coward like Pontius Pilate and let the mob decide the fate and yield to their wishes simply to look out for themselves. \n\nI have always been a good judge of character my entire life and I don't think I am wrong here. I stand by that. Sadly I can't say how this will turn out, though I am hopeful. I just wish the GOP would stop placating them and move on with it. \n\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I rewatched Kavanaugh's interview and my reason for being utterly pissed at it all has changed."}

She vehemently opposed the #MeToo movement, and she is absolutely correct that its full toxicity is now on display.\n\nThe Kavanaugh case is an absolute shit show. I cannot see how any reasonably, rationally thinking human being can not see it for the ploy that it is -- an obvious delay to the Kavanaugh confirmation. I know I'm preaching to the choice here, and I am not talking \"conspiracy theory\" or some other off-the-wall story. \n\nWe're literally talking about a man who has spent his life serving the people, who, when he was a teenager in high school got drunk at a house party and allegedly sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford, although the story inevitably keeps changing, the date for each side to tell their story is set in quicksand, and even the timing of the \"leak\" to the press is somewhat suspicious...\n\nAnyway, we have the 5th Amendment for a reason. We have processes in place for a reason. We are now letting women (and men) know that pointing a finger and calling someone guilty is the same thing as being guilty... and that's a HUGE problem one multiple levels. Today, while attempting to reason with a woman on Facebook (I know, big mistake) she instead insisted that she hopes I get sexually assaulted because I'm defending a sexual predator.\n\nFirst of all, what the heck is wrong with people? Like, you're really going to wish that on another person? What kind of messed up individual are you? And secondly, here's the thing -- if Kavanaugh is guilty, then by all means he should be punished accordingly. \n\nBut he's supposed to be INNOCENT until proven guilty. Today, I read an article about the Kavanaugh investigation and Judge Judy chimed in to say, \"One hopes that people wait and don\u2019t rush to judgement and listen to both sides of an argument before they make a decision. That\u2019s what\u2019s supposed to happen in a fair judicial process.\n\nThere\u2019s always the hope that reasoned people will listen to both sides of an argument before they make a judgment call. That\u2019s what people are supposed to do. They\u2019re not supposed to rush to judgment on either side. \n\nThey\u2019re supposed to listen to evidence and then make a judgment. And if that doesn\u2019t happen, then the end result is not fair.\"\n\nI believe that the liberal left knows exactly what is going on; they simply don't care. Or, perhaps they are no longer a \"reasoned people\". From what I can tell, many seem to have lost their ability to reason. \n\nThe true victim here is not Christine Blasey Ford... It's Brett Kavanaugh. ","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Why I'm Done Reasoning with the \"Tolerant\" Left"}

{"author":"matheus886","created_utc":1537933503,"num_comments":0,"score":12,"selftext":"To correct myself, wrong title, it's the other way around. It's Bolsonaro's campaign that has been so similar to Trump's in '16.\n\nIt's almost election day in Brazil. And with it there's chaos in social media and the brazilian net is so much engulfed in turmoil that's almost impossible to spend one day browsing it without being dragged into a political argument with other people online and becoming truly stressed out in the process. Specially if you're arguing with a leftist, well, at least for me. But I've seen many people changing their points of view and, probably as a result of extensive researching and knowledge, many people have been sticking to Jair Bolsonaro's side, a candidate running for president very known to be the only conservative candidate, and leading every poll so far.\n\nBolsonaro's campaign has been so successful its hard not to compare it with Trump's campaign back in 2016. I remember being so (positively) impressed when Trump won in the US I leaped out of my chair in joy, and it hasn't been very different everyday when I browse the web and see so many people supporting Bolsonaro. \n\nAs a result of more than a decade of a semi-socialist government that brought tons of corrupt scandals and broke brazilian economy, an economical and moral crisis that has been plaguing brazilian society with leftism and the same lack of values the american liberals have, and the fact that the overall population has been fed up by the same old political scandals in Brazil, more and more people have been sticking to Bolsonaro's side. Not to mention the tons of fake news the establishment and mass media have been spreading about Bolsonaro over the last few weeks, probably because they are desperate of a possibility of the candidate winning and putting an end to the bloody, merciless, cruel and morally wrong left and an end to the socialist ideology that has been plaguing the economy so much, established by the corrupt Workers Party (acronym in portuguese is 'PT')\n\nOver the last few weeks besides the fake news the left has been tweeting the hashtag \"#NotHim\" referring to Bolsonaro himself but it isn't working because it seems they are contributing to Bolsonaro's own campaign when they seem so annoyed by the probability of him becoming the president. They don't even have arguments against him anymore, and much like Trump, the left has been calling him a fascist, and a sexist, and a racist and whatnot but they don't even have any evidence whatsoever, and like liberals worldwide, they end up seeming like obnoxious and loud brats. Ah, and I was already forgetting to mention the fact that the hashtag has been used by millionaire artists who receive money FROM THE TAXPAYER to support their leftist causes and their shitty careers while good culture doesn't even exist anymore in Brazil. Conservative people and families here, fortunately the majority of the people, become even more likely to vote for Bolsonaro on the October 7th.\n \nI hope that Bolsonaro wins like Trump did in America, and that he's successful in his path forward up until the election day in convincing more people's hearts into voting for him, which I'm sure he'll do since we're so fed up by leftists in the government. He's the only man who stands for family christian values and order while he's also the only one for a capitalist economy, the only hope we Brazilians have against the Workers Party and against corruption. The man has been resting ever since he was stabbed during a campaign rally, by probably someone in service of a political plan against him, but now he's fine and has been recovering very well. God bless him. \n\nThe people who think they can do anything against him by calling him a fascist and whatnot are running out of names and proof against Bolsonaro. They don't even know what fascism means anyway, and much like in Trump's government, when they see the benefits for the population, without any discrimination liberals themselves come up with their twisted SJW agendas, Bolsonaro will impress many people. \n\nI'm sorry for such a long text, but I truly had to share this with my american (and also non american) conservative fellows out there. The only one who have right ideas and values is Jair Bolsonaro, and although I'm more of a right-wing libertarian guy myself, I'm now more than ever before likely to support this guy. \n\n#Bolsonaro2018\n\nEdit: typos and whatnot.

{"author":"pennyempresa","created_utc":1538002964,"num_comments":7,"score":18,"selftext":" I\u2019ve spent a lot of time this past year and half re-thinking some of my ideology and I wanted to share a bit here.\n\nI\u2019ve spent time here and other \u201cright\u201d forums, trying to educate myself. I\u2019ve decided thoughtfully to completely leave the left and the Democratic party.\n\nSo many reasons went into my decision, including that the new left has gone crazy. I hate their politics of personal destruction, I hate the outright dishonest deception, I hate that they are attacking our freedoms, I hate their vitriol, and I really, really hate they way they speak and treat fellow countrymen and create dangerous divisions.\n\nSome highlights of my genesis:\n\n* \u00b7 The ACA!!! Very enlightening to me. I listen to a lot of talk radio (for decades), I used to laugh at the warnings about what it would be by Rush et al. In hindsight I wish I and more would have listened.\n* \u00b7 A few years ago, on a flight (otherwise probably would have never watched), I watched the movie Lincoln, that Obama and party were really hyping a few years prior. After watching I was very disturbed by what in my opinion was the reason Obama loved it, it reaffirmed, I think, his philosophy that the ends justify the means regardless of the consent of the people. (Of course, that era brought good, though I believe it\u2019s dangerous to only take away the ends justify the means).\n* \u00b7 I was in Europe shortly after the peak migration from the ME. Again watching, listening, reading, \u201cright\u201d leaning forums, I thought they were being hyperbolic, reactionary, and agenda driven. And I was wrong again, I was shocked (foolish me), that there really was no hyperbole. This is not to say I don\u2019t have compassion for the migrants I encountered or the absolute disgust I have at what\u2019s happening in the ME. But the clash of cultures without any forethought to populations and integration is a travesty to everyone.\n\nAnd\u2026\n\nI am a middle aged, female, POC, a political refugee (came to the US in the early 80\u2019s), live in the suburbs (there are more of me than the media and polls I think\/hope know). I protested the WTO, I protested the Iraq wars, I protested the multi-nationals, I advocated to do something about monopolies and unfair trade practices, I left the country and lived in Europe during Bush\u2019s second term. I voted Dems, I voted third party, I voted Obama the first term. And then I woke up (and I think the parties shifted somewhat). \n\nI like Trump, I know this forum disagrees sometimes with policies Trump advocates, but I like the tariffs and his trade agenda, I like his foreign policies, I like he takes it to the terrible media, I like he fights for the country, I like that he is trying to change the status quo and hopefully will affect the stasis that effects all the global organizations (UN and NATO are a mess), I have first hand experience with the UN in New York and East Africa, they need someone to shake them up (the graft, waste, and corruption are heartbreaking).\n\nI have a good family, a good life, good work, and any grievances I have are directed at myself for not doing more and better and I didn\u2019t grow up easy, but I\u2019m making a good life. The Democrats seem not to understand anymore self-determination and self-respect. I am not a victim!!! And Holy Hell it is so condescending to be screamed at that I am a victim all the time.\n\nSo, long post, and there are so many other things that went into my thought process, the above are more recent and frequently in mind when I think of ideologies and how I make choices.\n\nMostly I want to say Stand Strong, and please Vote, Vote, Vote, and take everyone you know to Vote! I really hope the crazies on the left don\u2019t have any chance to govern in their current form. I hope to help bring some rationality to my little corner of the world. Thanks for being a great sub and for the enlightening conversations I\u2019ve eavesdropped on.\n\nI don\u2019t post often (haven\u2019t in a long time due to Reddit being toxic and so many good posters being driven away), spend little time on social media, and work crazy hours, if you all have any questions\/comments I\u2019ll try to get to them but might take me some time.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I\u2019m a Sanders to Trump Voter (and red down ballot in 2016) And I\u2019m coming out"}

They spent like $2000 on Facebook ads? You do realize I spent $1000 on my own right?\n\n And thousands if not millions of trump supporters most likely paid for their own ads as well?\n\nAnd further investigation found that those supposed Russians ran ads for both sides. It was discovered that they were really just selling off political influence cash rather than trying to influence the election\n\n\nSo what else you got? RT? The spokesman of Russian propaganda Network RT is Lee camp. A clear leftist who is not shy about his hatred of Donald  trump\n\nLet's see what else? So far that's basically all they've got. So what we've got is no evidence that Russia actually had any effect on the election or even attempted to have a major effect.\n\nAnd no evidence that Trump colluded with Russia to have an effect. We don't have any evidence that Trump gave anything to them or that they gave anything to Trump\n\nKind of the opposite of what it would look like?\n\nHowever that doesn't mean there's no evidence of Russian collusion\n\nwe do have evidence of Hillary Clinton and her campaign purchasing Russian propaganda in the form of a phony dossier from both the Russian government and a British spy\n\nWe know that the Russian propaganda that Hillary paid Russia for was used to try to influence the election and then to try to undermine the president of the United States. Which should be considered treason anyway.\n\n for all the investigating all we have is like Hillary Clinton clearly colluded with Russia in order to influence the election and then to undermine the US government\n\nbefore you bring up any Trump Tower meetings literally nothing happened at that meeting. There was nothing wrong with the meeting in the first place. Since Trump jr. Was simply following up on a lead that Hillary Clinton may have done something illegal. But the meeting went nowhere anyway. Trump jr. Gave nothing to the lawyer and the lawyer gave nothing to Trump jr.\n\nand before you bring up any arrests or indictments you'll have to remember that literally no person who ever worked for Trump was indicted for Russian collusion. The closest you have is Paul manafort who lobbied for the Ukraine while working for Democrat Tony podesta long before he ever worked for Trump trump\n\nSO TLDR\n\nno evidence that Russia influenced the election for Trump.

{"author":"billswinthesuperbowl","created_utc":1538116568,"num_comments":1,"score":24,"selftext":"Yesterday was the most disgusting display of human behavior I have ever seen from people (mainly the senate democrats). I cannot believe that people could look at this hearing today and what has led up to the hearing and come to any other conclusion other than the fact that democrats weaponized the \"me too\" movement to further a political goal. The supreme court over the past fifty years has become a tool for furthering democrats\u2019 political ideology onto the nation through judicial activism and legislating from the bench. Democrat appointed Justices are no longer expected to rule by the constitution but to kowtow to the party line that put them in the position. Democrats know this, and it is why Chuck Schumer promised to do everything he can to make sure a constitutionalist conservative does not get appointed because the swing on the court is enough that it could derail their agenda. The Supreme Court has become the most important cog in the wheel for democrats to further their political ideology and today we saw them drag the accused and an accused person through hell and back to do this.\n\nInstead of coming forward with the letter immediately and turning it over to the FBI so it could be included in the vetting process, Democrats waited until the hearings were over and released the letter to the media for them to run roughshod with zero accountability regarding the defamation of this man and his family. This was done with malice and intent for the sole purpose of maximizing the damage to Kavanaugh\u2019s character by the court of public opinion. There was no intent to ever have this investigated, for facts to be found, for a sexual assault survivor to be heard. No, the intent was to ruin a good man\u2019s character in hopes that it would derail a supreme court nomination until after the midterms. The sickening thing is people want these allegations to be true, they hope Dr. Ford was raped by Kavanaugh because those people want power. When questioning Kavanaugh, they didn\u2019t want answers to the night that happened, they wanted to trap him in a Kafkaesque world in which he is damned if he asks for an FBI investigation and damned if he doesn\u2019t. Instead of the truth they wanted their 10 second sound bite to run on the nightly news of him saying he doesn\u2019t want the FBI to investigate which he never fell for. Those people do not care about survivors of sexual assault or women, they care about furthering their political ideology by any means possible.\n\nSo here we are at the end of the day with top Democrats hoping these allegations are true, weaponizing allegations to further their political agenda, and trotting out an alleged sexual assault survivor that wished to remain anonymous solely because it furthers their political ideology.

{"author":"Human_Ballistics_Gel","created_utc":1538143728,"num_comments":0,"score":2,"selftext":"I was responding to a simple posting in a thread, and the thoughts kept coming. As the rabbit hole got deeper and deeper, I decided to make it a standalone post instead.\n\nPropaganda \n\n**Subtle**, propaganda is for changing minds \/ public opinion. This has become so pervasive now that it\u2019s the norm, and thus almost undetectable by the masses without a non-propagandized baseline to compare it to.  \n\nThis means a normal person\u2019s \u201cunbiased\u201d, \u201cbaseline\u201d content is in fact propagandized and skewed tremendously.  Fox news (not the opinion shows, just the news) for example is considered extreme far right, when in fact it\u2019s often rather left of center.\n\nThe **In your face** propaganda, that we\u2019re seeing now, is designed to motivate action. It\u2019s the dehumanization of the enemy (Trump and conservatism), so that the violence it encourages produces less guilt, and can be \u201cjustified\u201d as a righteous and necessary means to an end. \n\n(Think bike locks, pepper spray, and burning buildings and business)\n\nWhat we\u2019re seeing today is the modern equivalent of old war time propaganda. \n\nThink about it, we\u2019ve all seen examples of those old american wartime propaganda films that played before movies.  Recall them in your mind, who was the announcing voice?  How were they filmed?  They were produced exactly like the **news** stories of the time, just the wartime productions were higher energy and more **in your face**, designed for a different, specific purpose. \n\nThose movie films were how people received their visual news content.  \n\nThat distinctive announcer voice, the short compelling visual and audio clips (that may or may not be remotely in context) with the trusted news announcer voice telling the viewer exactly what to think and what to feel.  It is effective. Even today, when viewing them, and knowing how they work and what they were for, it still stirs something inside of us. \n\nThese were not designed to change minds, the subtle stuff had already done that. They were designed to energize, to call to action. \u201cEnlist, Buy War Bonds, Support the War Effort, FIGHT!\u201d\n\nToday, we have the exact same thing. And it\u2019s still delivered and presented as factual news, and much of what we see is still largely out of context or just plain fake. We even have the modernized trusted news \u201cvoice\u201d (narrator, written opinion, etc) still telling us what to think and how to feel.  The only differences are the new ways we ingest this \u201cnews\u201d. \n\nTV plot lines pushing the narrative, movies with the evil corporation trope, \u201cnews\u201d articles telling us 10 reasons why the way we think and feel is wrong... or just the good old fashion talking head news of CNN and MSNBC giving us those same short compelling clips of visual and audio, and then telling us how to think and feel about it. The only thing missing is a rousing march or a mournful orchestra background audio track to drive the emotion home. \n\nThe people we\u2019re seeing protesting today are sheep, Baaaaaaah!\u2019ing in unison. They\u2019ve been told to be outraged, so they are. They\u2019ve been told to be offended, so they are.  They\u2019ve been told to take action. So they are.  \n\nI\u2019m disgusted and repulsed by it. But at the same time, it\u2019s sadly understandable.  How much do you really blame the average North Korean for thinking the \u201cdear leader\u201d doesn\u2019t poop, birds sang across the land upon his birth, and he no longer plays golf having mastered the sport?\n\nThe kids of today have literally been raised on near North Korean style propaganda. Independent thought crushed out of them. 12 years of schooling where every day they\u2019re force fed liberalism, and outside of school the online media, movies, news, even video games all supporting the message. \n\nCan you blame them for thinking Trump is literally a Nazi? What choice did they have?  \n\nI argue that It\u2019s amazing that so many have managed to #walkaway and escape that thought prison. \n\nOf course we still have to fight them, just as we had to fight the brain washed masses of Germany, Japan, Korea and today\u2019s modern radical Islam. \n\nOnly now, our most dangerous enemy is the one within.

What's the risk? New Jersey is just a synonym for progressive, there were more important issues for the Democrat party to worry about.\n\nNow, I understand 538 is biased, but it does show general voter trends even if there is a 'base bias' with them. [Take a look at the mere SIX POLLS taken for the race, with zero the past month](https:\/\/projects.fivethirtyeight.com\/polls\/senate\/new-jersey\/)\n\nBob Hugin was more or less a no name to most people, and was allegedly losing by 20 points in April, well before the primaries and is consistent with the 2012 FINAL results.\n\nThere were three polls released in August, the first saying only a 2 point difference, the second saying a 10 point difference. All over the place! So let's look at the 'highest rated' pollster, Quinnipiac, and see the methodology and what their polling says. [Found here](https:\/\/poll.qu.edu\/new-jersey\/release-detail?ReleaseID=2563)\n\nWhat makes me think this is highly indicative of a red win in November is that 54 PERCENT OF VOTERS HAVE NOT MADE UP AN OPINION OF HIM yet. This means most of the people who would vote for him are voting AGAINST Menendez. \n\nAnother important thing to note is that this 'republican' is pro choice, pro LGBT, and is relatively distanced from DC. He has donated to Trump before but I honestly believe the November election is a referendum on Menendez for New Jersey voters, not Trump.\n\nIf this were a presidential race year then I think more democrats would be encouraged to go to the polls and also vote blue for Senate, but it is hard to see them energized seeing how terrible of a showing this is for democrats.\n\nAm I crazy? No one is talking about New Jersey, which I think is a mistake.\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Mark my words: New Jersey will go red in November?"}

They have found a glitch in the matrix and are fully taking advantage of it.\n\nLiberals are just as human and error prone as the rest of us. They make mistakes, lie and hurt others just like we all do from time to time.\n\nHowever, what they have been able to do, is hide behind the guise of CARING about equality to get away with this behavior.\n\nFor example, one of the most liberal, self righteous men I know, who constanlty tells me about how disrespectful I am towards women, cheats on his wife.\n\nThat's liberalism in a nutshell. These people LOVE to attack the morality of anyone who disagrees with their agenda. Notice how I said their agenda, not their beliefs.\n\nTheir agenda is to do whatever they have to to put themselves in a position to win. Win what? Well whatever is important to that particular person. It could be a seat on the supreme court or a promotion at work.\n\nUnderqualified? No problem, accuse the person who IS qualified of being a racist.\n\nMade a mistake you're embarassed about? No problem. Accuse the person who you hurt of being misogynistic.\n\nSomeone trying to hold you accountable for something you said you were going to do and then didn't? No problem. Call them a sexist and a bigot.\n\nWhat's truly alarming about liberals is their complete lack empathy for others. This is also true with narcissists, sociopaths and psychopaths.\n\nIf you ever find yourself on the receiving end of a liberal's scorn: buckle your seat belt.\n\nYou will be hit hard, fast and often until you are a shell of your former self, i.e. brett kavanaugh.\n\nThey have no tact and are unable to even realize the amount of hurt and pain they are causing others. And it is all in the name of power and control. Again, the same is true of narcissists, sociopaths and psychopaths.\n\nI attribute this behavior to their lack of life experience. You'll notice that most liberals are very unaccomplished people in the true sense of the word.\n\nThey are either VERY overreducated with little real world contribution and work expeirence OR they are complete leaches of society.\n\nAs a human being, by gaining more meaningful and REAL life experience you learn to have empathy for others.\n\nYou learn to seek problems to solutions rather than constant divides and arguments.\n\nLiberals do NOT have these qualities.\n\nI can tell you that I have been on the receiving end of liberal scorn, both in my professional and private life and it is an absolute living hell.\n\nAn emotionally mature person, when they are in conflict with another person, especially if they are winning, will at some point say \"enough is enough\" and either lay off the person or try to find some medium ground. In short, they will act like an adult.\n\nWith liberals? Forgot about it. You are dealing with a grown adult child who has very little compassion or empathy for anyone other than themselves.\n\nIn conclusion I just want to say that I find myself deeply troubled in the direction this country is going. If it can happen at the highest levels of government, it sure as hell can happen in your office or in your home.\n\nI would encourage others who are frustrated to stand your ground as best you can. Pick your battles and realize that some fights are not worth it, especially at work.\n\nBut if you really want to seperate yourself from a liberal, there are several things you can do:\n\n1. Have compassion for your fellow human beings. Try your best to put yourself in someone else's shoes.\n2. Learn how to communicate. Sometime the quickest way to achieve a resoluton is to humble yourself instead of throwing more gas on the fire.\n3. Be proud of YOURSELF. You need no one elses' attention or praise to feel good about your accomplishements.\n\nThank you for letting me vent and in the words of a better man than I,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeace...One day\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The Liberal Mind"}

That is, the role of social conservatives. \n\nTo me, social conservatism is skepticism or opposition to affirmative social policies on issues such as gay marriage, abortion, transgenderism, or third-wave feminism. \n\nThe Left has absolutely dominated in these areas, normalizing most of these things in our culture very rapidly. Of course, part of this is due to the media\u2019s celebration of these things.\n\nRecently, I\u2019ve observed more and more Conservatives adopt an attitude of \u201cWe lose on social issues, therefore we shouldn\u2019t fight them.\u201d \n\nTo me, this attitude seems negligent because allowing the Left to dominate our culture without effective resistance puts us in an inherently defensive (and disadvantaged) position on other issues, like the Second Amendment. We lose the war if we lose the culture, and for that reason I fear for the future.\n\nThe \u201cHow\u201d part of this discussion is a little more difficult.\n\nI just threw out a bunch of my thoughts, but I really want to have a discussion about this.

A classmate shouted out: \u2018racists\u2019 \nInstead of correcting the student my teacher agreed with a chuckle saying \u2018most of them\u2019 \n\nOut of curiosity I asked some of my friends to do the Political compass quiz - unsurprisingly they all landed in the Lib Left box (I\u2019m lib right) \nA classmate commenting \u2018I\u2019m going to use this to figure out who to avoid\u2019 \n\nAs someone who will be going to university with these people quite soon, this worries me a lot \n\nAt my school we have this diversity training workshop thing and the administrator literally said \u2018this is a manual on how to fight for social justice - we hope that you\u2019ll become social justice warriors!\u2019\nI don\u2019t know if he knew the implications of that term or if he was aware of the uneasiness I felt as I felt the stares of my classmates. \n\nSee for the last few years, I\u2019ve become more and more disillusioned with the left. I used to be a social justice warrior. I used to be an admin for an LGBTQ+ support Instagram page where I\u2019d express my admiration for intersectionality and hijabs and my hatred for white men. \n\nI\u2019ve been told over and over again that I\u2019m not \u2018woke\u2019 enough. The truth is that I saw through the illogical and paradoxical nature of many leftist beliefs. I no longer believe that I\u2019m always right or that I know everything. Or that everyone who differs from me is an idiot. \n\nThe other day I was called a racist. A woman hater (I\u2019m a girl btw) \n\nSurely I can\u2019t be the only conservative at my school but lately I\u2019ve been feeling lost. \n\nA lot of my points in class are met with silence, sometimes even condemnation. Cheap points about Trump being an orange man with small hands receive laughter.\n\nI had an experience last term at a compulsory diversity training where as I was making a point the administrator cut me off to call me a \u2018republican\u2019 as an insult. Firstly, republican in it of itself isn\u2019t an insult. Secondly, I\u2019m not even American. \nShe then continued her speech without letting me finish and no one said a thing. \n\nI made the conscious decision this term that I wouldn\u2019t allow myself to be silenced by these people who think that their undergrad social studies degree makes them superior to me. \n\nI think a middle ground can be reached but it\u2019s never going to happen if we don\u2019t have targeted disagreements. (I may be able to find the printout that was handed to me at the \u2018training\u2019 if anyone\u2019s interested) \n\nI\u2019d like to know if there are any other Gen Z conservatives still in high school or in college and if you are, is your environment just as hostile?\n\nWhat advice would you give someone like me? \n\n\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I\u2019m a gen Z conservative"}
