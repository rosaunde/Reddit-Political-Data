The show started out as a humble audio-only podcast and then developed into a live stream with video, a call in number and in-studio guests.\n\nRegardless of the fact that we have been doing this this show for a long time and the hosts still remain as positive and committed as the first day we started, it kills me that they can't seem to find an audience. 4 years of doing this show has netted them an average of 10 views per hour-long episode. I've seen kids draw more viewers playing video games after only a few streams. \n\nI guess you could say I'm biased since I produce the show, but I think these guys do a pretty good job. They are entertaining and have a good conservative head on their shoulders - just all-around good guys. While this post will probably get deleted, I figured I would try once again to promote these guys and their show. It's called Unleashed Opinion. Thank you.\n\nUnleashed Opinion Channel(https://www.youtube.com/user/starfishprime2010)","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Conservative Podcast"}

Sexual orientation? Gender? Race? Everything is a choice! It's all a matter of how you identify. \n\nRemember during the gay marriage debates in 2004 when smug liberals went on TV shows like Bill O'Reilly and shamed him for daring to ask if sexual preference was a choice? They'd ask him stinging questions like \"if sexuality is a preference, then do you remember what age you decided that you were straight?\". Gay liberals would emotionally speak in interviews about how difficult being gay is, and that if it were actually a choice they would not have chosen to be gay.\n\nNow liberals are screaming that sexuality this 100% choice and that you can actually change your sexuality several times a day if you want to.  Milo Yiannopoulos was recently called transphobic because he said that his homosexuality is just part of who he is and not something that he can decide. \n\nI wonder if the gay community will realize that the left is not their friends and that they were totally used?","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"It's a choice! ...Or not?"}

{"author":"veritasserum","created_utc":1515109424,"num_comments":11,"score":0,"selftext":"Dear Lefties And Progressives -\n\nFor years, you demanded bigger and bigger government telling us what do with our businesses, our hiring, our guns, our wallets, and even our bathrooms.  Now you're outraged that this great big government is telling YOU what to do?  Choke on it.  I mean, stuff it down your nosy, self important, whiny little throats and just ... choke on it ... hard.\n\nMaybe that whole Doctrine Of Enumerated Powers was a pretty good idea?  Naw, choke on it.\n\nOn, and you Republican \"Originalists\" who loved Scalia so much (so did I).   Where exactly is the Enumerated Power that gives the Feds standing to stick their noses into what adults smoke, snort, shoot, or put in their bottoms?  There's certainly room for individual states to do this under the Federalist system, but it ain't remotely a Federal enumerated power.  So .. please ... choke on it.\n\nWhile we're at it,  libertarians who think this is the central issue of liberty today need to choke on it too.  It's a nice theory that we should just legalize drugs.  But what you're not processing here is that the leviathan government that we have has a bunch of intertwined interests and there are real costs to legalization.  For one thing, the various drooling fools on the left want drugs legalized, but the medical and personal costs socialized.  They want us to pay for the medical and psychological care of addicts, for instance.  \n\nThen there is the REALLY stupid argument that we'd save money by not incarcerating so many people.  Ever been to felony court?  I have (as a jury foreman, not as the accused).  The people who get even that far are almost all overwhelmingly scumbags.  No one is locking anyone up for selling dime bags.  They're using drug charges they can prove to take down people who are known to be violent and dangerous but cannot be proven so to the legal standard.  While exceptions do exist, if someone is in jail, it's extremely likely - most of the time - they belong there.  Most DAs do not have the budget to go after low rent, low risk criminals.  \n\nIn principle, I want no Federal government involvement at all in this matter.  In practice, I don't even want the States to make it legal UNTIL they do several things in the law that does make it legal:\n\n- Make it impossible for drug users to socialize the cost and consequences of their behavior.\n- Make it legal ONLY on private property.  Not in public, not driving, not at the airport ... ONLY on private property out of sight of the rest of society - medical use included.\n- Make it highly illegal to traffic to minors.  Say the age is 21.  If you provide drugs to anyone under that age, for every year they are under 21, you spend 5 years in jail.  Yes, that includes alcohol and smokes too.\n- Explicitly make it possible for employers to discriminate by job category as regards to drug consumption.  If United Airlines doesn't care that their janitors get high, but doesn't want their pilots stoned, they should jolly well be able to implement such a program with zero legal interference.\n- Come up with a field sobriety test that is at least as good as today's breath tests for alcohol.  I don't much want to be driving around with a bunch of idiots high on PCP on the road.\n\nIn the mean time, I continue to bask in the glow of the big government pukes on the left and right who can just .... choke on it.\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The War On Week: The Sessions Decision Today"}

Password security is important these days but I was given my password written on a piece of paper by one of the IT staff and then asked to share that password with my co-worker.  \n\nThrough KPMG\u2019s internal website I found that sharing passwords was against policy even with IT staff members.  I brought the situation up to my manager and they quickly told me that I needed to share my password anyway.  That\u2019s when I realized I could no longer work there and I resigned the following day.\n\nI decided to switch my field to construction and on more then one occasion I was either paid less then the agreed upon amount or not paid at all.  In one situation I was subcontracted by a general contractor and I quoted him $500 for a simple bathroom remodel.  He didn\u2019t like the price so we settled on an hourly rate.  The client added on a full week\u2019s worth of work to the job and the Contractor said he would pay me for the extra work when the job was done.  At the end of the week I had been paid a total of $400.  Instead of paying me though the contractor complained that I had worked too slow so he didn\u2019t owe me anything else.\n\nI refused to leave his vehicle until he paid me so he called a friend of his who showed up and told me to leave.  I\u2019ll never forget when he said to me \u201cThis is Quebec, this is how we do it in Quebec.\u201d  After some \u201cflexing\u201d on their part I finally gave up and walked away.  Just as I turned around though, his friend punched me in the back.  I considered fighting back, but I wanted to take him to court and knew fighting back would look bad.  He owed me $1000 just when I needed it and it took me a month to pay my rent.\n\nAfter that I thought I\u2019d take my chances in the food industry instead, so I got myself a job working as a dishwasher at a local Pub named PJ\u2019s pub.  It seemed professional at first and the kitchen had a military feel to it when the owner, Peter Sergakis, came around to inspect.  The cook told me that Peter had immigrated to Canada and had started off working as a dishwasher just like me.  I didn\u2019t mind the extra stress each time they added more work and responsibilities. \n\nThe problem began when my coworker told me she had showed up early and didn\u2019t get paid.  The schedule was changed and no one told her, so she worked an extra hour a day for two weeks without pay.  After she complained to the manger they cut her shifts in half.\n\nI started checking my pay stubs and realized they had been hiding my hourly rate so they could pay me less then the total hours I worked.  I went back to check all of the pay stubs and found they never paid me overtime either, even when I worked 50 to 60 hours in a week.  I brought this up to my Manager and he tried to convince me that I had been paid for every minute that I worked but I started taking photographs of my time cards to compare them to my pay stubs.  They weren\u2019t matching up.\n\nSergakis is a Montreal business tycoon and he owns multiple bars, restaurants and apartment buildings as well as a strip club.  After doing a little research and asking around I found out that his businesses are notorious for violating employment law in Quebec.  My coworkers were hesitant to talk to me about pay, and there was an overall uneasiness in the air which may be related to Peter\u2019s \u201ctycoon\u201d nature.\n\nI put in my two weeks notice at PJ\u2019s Pub and found a busboy job working at a bar called Knox.  Like PJ\u2019s my time at Knox started well.  I worked hard, long hours and I tracked 40 flights of stairs in a night on my iPhone.  The work was exhausting, and I closed every night at 4am. The tips weren't bad either and when they added more hours to my schedule I accepted.\n\nThe problems started right away though when my first paycheck didn\u2019t arrive on time and they didn\u2019t offer me a pay stub.  I worked there for 2 months and was never paid on time for a single weekly paycheck.  Each week I asked them for my pay stubs and each time they said I had to wait till later but time was never made.\n\nPay wasn\u2019t the only problem because the Manager was aggressive and multiple people quit unexpectedly or had break downs at work.  One night while I was working one of the bartenders came up to me and told me to ignore the owners and managers because he thought I was doing a good job and he saw they were giving me a hard time.  Later that night the manager approached me and told me quote \u201cYou\u2019re dumb and unteachable\u201d because I hadn\u2019t cleared a table fast enough.  I put in my two weeks notice soon after.  I did some calculations from the only pay stub they ever gave me near the end of my two months.  The total year to date hours weren\u2019t listed on the pay stub so I had to do the math myself but once again the numbers weren\u2019t adding up.\n\nNot all of my experiences working in Montreal were bad but in comparison to anywhere else I\u2019ve worked the negative experiences far outweigh the positive.  Things that I considered unprofessional in the past seemed to be standard practice everywhere I went.  In short if you\u2019re an American looking to escape and find work in Canada, Montreal is the last place you want to be.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Marine Vet gets treated like illegal Mexican in Canada"}

{"author":"JohnSemmens","created_utc":1515220855,"num_comments":0,"score":3,"selftext":"Singer Says Trump Tax Cuts \"Unfair\"\n\nThis week, retired singer Barbra Streisand took to Twitter to vent against the recently passed tax cuts saying that \"blue states, athletes, actors, writers, producers, and directors will be punished by this scam of a tax bill. It targets those of us who have earned millions entertaining America. It limits property tax deductions to only a single residence and caps it at $10,000 per year. I, myself, have several homes. I don't remember exactly how many, but all of them are in the multimillion dollar range and have annual tax bills far in excess of $10,000.\"\n\n\"What Trump fails to understand is that my fans want me to have the millions I've acquired through my talent,\" Streisand asserted. \"Changing the law to make me pay more in taxes is an injustice. The rich that ought to be targeted are those who gained their fortunes by the crass merchandising of daily necessities like food, fuel, and housing\u2014the kind of things government should be providing gratis to everyone. Hard-working actors and singers who had to claw their way up to where they could charge $10 million to make a movie or $150 per seat at a concert are the elite of the working class and deserve to be better treated by our laws.\"\n\nStreisand said she reneged on her August 2016 promise to leave the country if Trump won the election because \"traveling is just too hard. I know I could probably avoid the nasty impacts of the tax changes if I moved to another country. Checks for my millions in royalties and returns on my investments could be mailed to me, but I feel I owe it to my fans who can't escape to stay and, on their behalf, harangue Congress until they impeach the President.\"\n\nIt seems likely that Streisand will become even more unglued when she catches wind of longtime adviser to Hillary Clinton Philippe Reines' publicly announced fear that \"millennials might become Republican if they notice they don't have to pay as much taxes. This could be a devastating blow to Democrats who need to keep these voters focused on the outrage of diverting money away from government and into the hands of those who earned it.\"\n\nIn related news, California Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de Le\u00f3n (D-LA) has introduced a bill that would allow wealthy taxpayers to evade the new federal tax law by redefining payments to the State government as \"donations.\" The gist of the plan is to establish what he calls \"the California Excellence Slush Fund. Payments to this Fund would be available to the government for whatever uses we deem fit. For example, this money could be spent to defend California's sanctuary status against the invasion of federal authorities seeking to deport people it says are in the country illegally.\"\n\nGore Says Bitter Cold Confirms Global Warming\n\nFormer Vice-President Al Gore confidently brushed aside the possibility that this past week's bitter cold across much of North America might indicate that the global warming he has profitably been hyping for the last 15+ years could be mistaken.\n\n\"The theory of global warming, or climate crisis that I now like to call it, postulates that any change in the weather merely confirms the global warming hypothesis,\" Gore declared. \"The most important action anyone can take at this time is to continue to buy copies of my books and movies explaining how it all fits together.\"\n\nMeanwhile, observations of solar output show a pattern of decreasing heat reaching Earth from the sun. Many climate scientists are predicting that a global cooling trend for the next several decades seems more likely than a continuation of the warming trend Gore has been warning must be addressed by massive government regulations aimed at \"lowering the excessively indulgent lifestyles enjoyed by Americans.\" Strangely, despite railing against the general public's bad behavior, Gore's own lifestyle is far more indulgent than that of average American consumers who possess neither energy-guzzling palatial estates nor their own personal jet aircraft.\n\nIn another holier-than-thou incident, England's Prince William urged commoners \"to reduce the number of children they bear in order to save the Earth from an excess of surplus population.\" That the Prince's wife is currently pregnant with their third child has led some to call the Prince a hypocrite. The Prince rebuffed the accusation by pointing out that \"my children are assured the means to have fruitful and meaningful lives. The same cannot be said for the common run of mankind who must despoil the planet just to make a living.\"\n\nFormer FBI Director Leaked Classified Memos\n\nIn July of 2016, FBI Director James Comey chastised Democratic presidential candidate for her \"extremely careless handling of classified emails.\" It now appears that Comey himself may have been \"extremely careless\" when he leaked classified memos to a friend with instructions that they be subsequently leaked to the media in the hope that it would lead to the appointment of his friend Robert Mueller as Special Counsel.\n\nThis week, David Hardy, Chief FOIA Officer of the FBI, made out a sworn statement that \"all of Director Comey's memos were classified when they were written and remain classified to this day. For someone as well-informed as the Director to distribute these memos to a person or persons lacking the proper security clearance would constitute gross negligence and disregard of the statutes controlling who has legal access to such information.\"\n\nIronically, an earlier draft of Comey's July 2016 chastisement cited Mrs. Clinton's criminal \"gross negligence\" in her handling of classified material sent through unsecured channels to her private off-site computer, a number of which ended up in the possession of convicted \"sexter\" former Congressman Anthony Weiner. Previously, Mrs. Clinton has said that she asked her aide Huma Abedin, who is married to Weiner, to send her emails\u2014some of which were classified\u2014to her home computer so they could be printed out. Last month, Abedin's cousin Omar Amanat was convicted of financial fraud. Previously, Amanat was involved in a $300 million real estate project with Vladislav Doronin, a man referred to in the British press as the \"Russian Donald Trump.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif) called this recent turn of events \"extremely frightening. Technically, Comey may have broken the law by sharing classified info with the media, but he was in a tough spot. A man who the FBI did its utmost to try to prevent being elected president was his boss when he leaked those memos. I believe he was trying to save the nation from a grievous error committed by voters who were duped by Russian propaganda into to turning against Secretary Clinton. I feel more strongly than ever that we have to oust Trump and get someone in there who will pardon Comey and those other patriots who tried to save the nation from falling into the hands of this madman.\"\n\nIn related news, James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence during the Obama Administration, called President Trump's complaints about the FBI spying on his campaign and manufacturing false \"evidence\" aimed at undermining his Administration \"reprehensible and disturbing. While the agency's actions may not have strictly adhered to the law, there can be no question that their intentions were honorable. As they saw it, Trump threatened everything they fought for during their years in government. At worst, they are guilty of justifiable intervention in an attempt to save the country from a madman.\"\n\nDire Economic News Heartens Dems 2018 Election Hopes\n\nA trio of recently released economic statistics have boosted Democratic hopes of retaking the majority in the House and Senate later this year. First, in December, private employers increased payrolls by stepping up hiring and reducing layoffs. Second, unemployment among blacks fell to the lowest level since 1972. Third, the number of Americans on food stamps fell by two million.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez labeled these statistics \"the starkest of warnings concerning the sad fate in store for average Americans under Republican government. Millions are being forced out of the social safety net so meticulously constructed for them by the Democratic Party and into the harsh world of imposed self-sufficiency. In just one year alone two million Americans have been bumped from the food stamp program. Instead of having the government put food on their tables these poor souls will now have to do it themselves.\"\n\n\"We are especially concerned about the racist implications of herding more blacks into the labor force,\" Perez said. \"This return to the type of slavery to which blacks were subjugated prior to the Civil War is a barbarous reversal of the freedoms Democrats extended under the Great Society welfare programs initiated when Lyndon Johnson was president. Republicans should be ashamed.\"\n\n\"As tough as these policies may be on our base over the next ten months, they bode well for our chances of prevailing in November,\" Perez continued. \"If we can successfully portray the election as a choice between labor vs. leisure we believe we can muster a majority of voters to reject the changes the GOP is foisting on our constituents. Admittedly, motivating a base that has already rejected effort as their responsibility seems daunting. Getting people unaccustomed to supporting themselves to make the minimal effort to cast a ballot will be no easy task, but it is one we must undertake if we want to keep America on the path laid out by successive generations of Democratic government.\"\n\nTo help promulgate this message, Congressional Democrats are planning to conduct \"teach-ins\" on Martin Luther King Day. \"We plan to rally Americans against the Trump tax cuts that are overturning a way of life that requires the redistribution of wealth by government,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) said. \"We need to boost government spending on social benefits to ensure that a person's choice to take a job is not due to the duress of needing money to support herself and her children. The option to work or not work must be free from any form of coercion. Only generous and unconditional entitlements can do that.\"\n\nCars Burned to Celebrate New Year\n\nIn France, burning cars on New Year's Eve is becoming more popular. This year's toll of 1,031 vehicles torched, predominately by Muslims residing in the country, topped last year's 935. French Sociologist Michel Wieviorka maintains that we should consider these arsonists as \"playful rather than criminal in nature. The vandals are mostly young men of foreign heritage coming from countries where automobiles are rare. On the one hand, there is a genuine and warranted expression of rage at a society in which cars are available to some, but not all. They are hitting out at the injustice of a system that distributes these vehicles based on the ability to pay for them.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, setting vehicles on fire and running away seems like great fun,\" Wieviorka observed. \"And the risk of arrest is minimal. Burning cars are such a normal event on New Year's Eve now that police shrug them off. For example, last year, when more than 900 bars were set ablaze the Interior Ministry reported that the New Year's celebrations had gone off 'without incident.' Rather than get ourselves worked up over it, we should adapt to the cultural enrichment these immigrants are bringing to France.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a fire at the Chappaqua home of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is reported to have destroyed all of the personal emails from her tour of duty at the State Department. A heartbroken Mrs. Clinton expressed regrets that \"my decision to delete these precious memories from the official files I turned over when I left now means that there is no way to recover the correspondence leading up to my daughter's wedding or the heart-felt chats I had with my yoga buddies and Clinton Foundation donors.\"\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: January 7, 2018 Edition"}

So i decided to look at some reports for myself, and figure out if this were the case, and wanted to know if what i learned was true. \n\nFirst we take California:\n\n**Federal Revenue Generated**: Around $405.8 Billion\n\n**Federal Aid Received**: $368 Billion\n\nThis seems to so some type of imbalance, and that surely they are pay way more in right? But then you take a look at how much they are getting back in SALT Deductions.\n\n**SALT Deductions back to Cali**: $101 Billion\n\n**Total In**: $405.8 Billion\n\n**Total Back**: $469 Billion\n\nAgain these are rough numbers, and i pulled them from a few different sources really quickly. But am i thinking this through correctly?

The argument goes something like \"it is only amnesty if it includes citizenship\", which is to say that giving illegal immigrants legal status isn't amnesty.  \n\nWe should be clear: legal status (even without citizenship) absolutely IS amnesty.\n The DACA deal that is being discussed IS amnesty.  It's an agreement not to deport and/or prosecute people who entered illegally. Let's look at the Reagan deal as an example.\n\nReagan's infamous deal was for legal status of about 2.7 million immigrants.  Was this amnesty, even though it wasn't outright granting of citizenship for 2.7 million?  Yes, it was.  Only about a third nationalized in the next 2 decades.  Does that mean only 1 million got amnesty?  Absolutely not.  All 2.7 million or so did.\n\nWhat we have seen, and will continue to see, is an attempt to conflate the two to make policies look more hawkish than they are.  The reality is, LEGAL STATUS is what amnesty is.

{"author":"Rightquercusalba","created_utc":1515767967,"num_comments":2,"score":1,"selftext":"&gt;The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards. Wall was not properly funded, Chain &amp; Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime countries which are doing badly. I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. I want safety and security for our people. I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. I want to fund our military, not do a Dem defund. Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards. The Dems will threaten \u201cshutdown,\u201d but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most. Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\n\nhttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump via DuckDuckGo\n\nSo now you know why Democrats are trying to blow up the headlines about Trump's alleged comments about Hatian immigrants. \n\n&gt;The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!\n\n&gt;Sadly, Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal, not a fair deal, for DACA. Take care of our Military, and our Country, FIRST!\n\n&gt;Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said \u201ctake them out.\u201d Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trust!\n\nAnd there you have it. Ann Coulter jumped the shark yesterday, and it's pretty sad that so many other conservatives jump to conclusions so quickly. In fact, listening to conservative talk radio this morning, the local program was saying \"Trump doesn't deny saying shithole, geez he needs to learn to stop shooting his mouth off.\" And less than an hour later Trump is denying those accusations. And yet every liberal news outlet was parroting the same thing and probably saving the soundbites and copying the headlines from conservatives on this issue.\n\n STOP feeding them opposition propaganda material, cool your jets. Geez, as pro Trump as I am, when Laura  Ingraham talked about the DACA meeting she clearly stated that she was concerned yet was reserving judgement until more of the facts were out. We are all guilty of this, I jump in the opposite direction, I defend Trump from the start until more facts are out. But it's a sound strategy because I refuse to be useful the people that immediately jump to conclusions that fit their anti Trump narrative which is almost always anti conservative. That doesn't mean conservstives don't have good intentions when they fall into the trap, but it's a trap none the less.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Trump DACA \"deal\" exposes the fear mongering of his critics after Trump reveals the deal that never actually happened."}

But this whole story is really rubbing me the wrong way.\n\nSo I'm driving to work this morning listening to the radio and the station I listen to is a CBS affiliate so every 30 mins or so they run their 5 minute news segment.  Anyways up to this point I had not heard anything about this story.  So the segment starts and the first thing they say is Donald Trump is underfire for uttering a \"racial expletive\" in a closed door meeting on immigration policy yesterday.  They then go on to quote the line \"why do we need to bring people in from 'blank' countries?\".  They then play an interview of a UN guy saying there was no other way to interpret what he said other then it being racist.  They mention his \"slur\" was directed towards Haiti, El Salvador and some African countries.\n\nThen they go on to say noone in the white house has denied the alligation. Yet at the very end of the segment they mention Trumps tweet saying \"tough words were used in the discussion but not those tough words\" or whatever his tweet was. So which is it? \n\nFrom that segment alone I had no idea what the word he used was.  But the implicating was he said an actual racial slur not \"shit hole\".  For the layman just getting a quick news update I would assume they were talking about an actual racial slur which would be a totally unacceptable, gross and racist thing to say.\n\nBut the reality is much different.  Let's assume Trump did in fact call those countries \"shit holes\".  That is not a racist comment.  That is not a racial explitive.  That is not a racial slur. That's not even close to anything racial. But if you start a report saying that *is* what it is before you report on the actual wording used then you can paint that phrase as being racist.\n\nIn other words this is a glaring case of the media creating the news rather then simply reporting exactly what was said in context and letting the viewers decide on their own the implications of what was said.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The 'shithole' comment is a perfect example of the medias glaring bias against a Trump."}

{"author":"mm1255","created_utc":1515778874,"num_comments":1,"score":0,"selftext":"With immigration being the current legislative priority for the Trump administration I though that it might be a good idea to have an open discussion about what American immigration policy should look like.  I originally typed my thoughts in response to another comment on this sub but I will paste it here in hopes to start a discussion about what the priorities of American immigration law should be.  These are my thoughts on what\u2019s wrong with our current attitudes of what immigration to America should be.  \n\nI\u2019d argue part of what makes us great is that so many people from so many backgrounds can all come together and unify around the ideas of liberty and individualism, no matter the nationality or skin color.  Nowadays, we seem to find that idea insensitive, or elitist, or even bigoted, the idea that immigrants should come here and assimilate to become apart of the culture we have built around these ideals for over 200 years.  Unfortunately, in many areas of the country, often what happens is that immigrants (especially from \u201cshithole\u201d countries) come to America to an area with many other immigrants from their home country and they form their own communities that are almost completely distinct from the surrounding communities of Americans; no English is spoken and they often only do business with people in these communities.  It can cause these immigrant communities to be almost completely isolated from the rest of our society.  Yet this is considered ideal by many on the left because we\u2019re allowing these immigrants to \u201cpreserve their culture\u201d.  Call me racist, bigoted, whatever you want, but I don\u2019t think it benefits the country to create these \u201cpockets\u201d of often impoverished immigrants in places like California and Miami.  We should be allowing in people who will be willing to make the effort to become part of our diverse American society, and who value the traditional American ideals that made us the greatest country in the world.  \n\nYou can respond to my thoughts or you can post your own and start a discussion FROM A CONSERVATIVE POINT OF VIEW ;) Ideally I think this discussion should be more about ideas and less about what our leaders or public figures are discussing specifically; what about immigration is important to YOU?","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"A few remarks on immigration..."}

But this whole story is really rubbing me the wrong way.\n\nSo I'm driving to work this morning listening to the radio and the station I listen to is a CBS affiliate so every 30 mins or so they run their 5 minute news segment.  Anyways up to this point I had not heard anything about this story.  So the segment starts and the first thing they say is Donald Trump is underfire for uttering a \"racial expletive\" in a closed door meeting on immigration policy yesterday.  They then go on to quote the line \"why do we need to bring people in from 'blank' countries?\".  They then play an interview of a UN guy saying there was no other way to interpret what he said other then it being racist.  They mention his \"slur\" was directed towards Haiti, El Salvador and some African countries.\n\nThen they go on to say noone in the white house has denied the alligation. Yet at the very end of the segment they mention Trumps tweet saying \"tough words were used in the discussion but not those tough words\" or whatever his tweet was. So which is it? \n\nFrom that segment alone I had no idea what the word he used was.  But the implicating was he said an actual racial slur not \"shit hole\".  For the layman just getting a quick news update I would assume they were talking about an actual racial slur which would be a totally unacceptable, gross and racist thing to say.\n\nBut the reality is much different.  Let's assume Trump did in fact call those countries \"shit holes\".  That is not a racist comment.  That is not a racial explitive.  That is not a racial slur. That's not even close to anything racial. But if you start a report saying that *is* what it is before you report on the actual wording used then you can paint that phrase as being racist.\n\nIn other words this is a glaring case of the media creating the news rather then simply reporting exactly what was said in context and letting the viewers decide on their own the implications of what was said.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The 'shithole' comment is a perfect example of the medias glaring bias against a Trump.""num_comments":1,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"TheBiasDaily","title":"The 'shithole' comment is a perfect example of the medias glaring bias against a Trump."}

Now, I know, the term *Liberalism* doesn't seem like something that should be considered in a conservative subreddit, but hear me out. The founders of our great country were serious fanboys of John Locke. Classical Liberalism simply means that individuals have their own agency. Our entire constitution was founded on the principle of negative rights where the government could not infringe upon our individual activities. \n\nAccording to Classical Liberal philosophers, governments are created in order to protect individuals against each other. Differences between these philosophers manifest themselves in their practice with regards to the state of nature. Hobbes thought that the state of nature was chaotic in the sense that given ultimate freedom, man would infringe upon the rights of other men. Rousseau had a different view on the state of nature, in which he viewed it as ultimately good, and that in the absence of government, man would be restored to the good of life without the restrictions of civilization, giving credence to the \"noble savage.\" Locke, in contrast, argued that government was necessary, much in the way of Hobbes in his noted work *Leviathan*, but that governments were only instituted by men, and that man himself was capable of government tyranny. Basically, in order to protect ourselves from each other, we can't give someone too much power, but there must be power over people in order to not infringe upon our rights.  \n\nThis week's Sidebar honoree is John Locke. Without him, there isn't much of a political philosophy upon which the framers of our constitution base their ideals upon. This quote distills the ideas of Locke's governmental philosophy by explaining that the purpose of government itself should only be there in order to preserve liberty.

{"author":"JohnSemmens","created_utc":1515871999,"num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"Senator Illegally Releases Classified Testimony\n\nThis week, Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif) illegally released classified testimony given by Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson to the Senate Judiciary Committee. At first, she blamed \"a bad head cold\" for this lapse in judgment. Later, she alleged \"I just got pressured.\"\n\nNow she disavows her earlier lame excuses, asserting that \"I never said I was pressured\" and speculates that a reporter \"misunderstood my complaint about the severe sinus pressure I was experiencing with the cold.\"\n\nThe reporter in question, BuzzFeed's Emma Loop, says she has heard a recording of the Senator alluding to getting pressured and wanted to know \"who was pressuring you?\"\n\n\"Look, the Fusion GPS lawyer asked me to released the copy of the testimony to the media,\" Feinstein now recalled. \"I just forgot that it was classified. I don't know what all the fuss is about. Everything is going to be released eventually. Besides, I'm not some sailor taking a selfie in a submarine. I'm a United States Senator\u2014one of only a hundred in the world. I think I, like Secretary Clinton, deserve a little latitude for what was obviously a minor misstep in my long career of public service.\"\n\nTrump Immigration Question Sparks Outrage\n\nDuring a private meeting at the White House to work on an immigration bill, President Trump is reported to have asked \"why are we having all these people from shit-hole countries come here?\"\n\nMeeting attendee Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill) called Trump's words \"hate-filled\" and \"the worst words ever spoken in the Oval Office. Frankly, it's embarrassing to have a man capable of such language as the nation's Chief Executive. I don't know if it's a high crime, but it certainly seems at least a misdemeanor.\"\n\nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Az), who was not at the meeting, said \"I was aghast at what Dick told me about what Trump said. The words Trump used were abhorrent and repulsive. I don't see how anyone with any sense of decency can continue to serve in a government run by such a person. If only my colleagues would follow my example the country would be faced with the stark choice of him or us. Maybe then the nightmare would end.\"\n\n\"Putting the President's hateful words aside, I will answer why we want people from these countries to come to America,\" Durbin said. \"These people live in dire poverty. They are ill-educated. Many need expensive medical care that is not available where they come from. Their governments are run by dictatorial kleptocrats. They need rescue. Who better to provide that rescue than America. We have more wealth than we need or deserve. If we let them in we can sustain them in lifestyles they could never dream of reaching back home and earn their loyalty.\"\n\nMamady Traore, a sociologist from the African nation of Guinea, confirmed Trump's perception, saying \"he is absolutely right. Africa is a continent of shit. When you have heads of state who mess with the constitutions to perpetuate their power. When you have rebel factions that kill children, disembowel women, who mutilate innocent civilians. Frankly, it must be said that it's crap.\"\n\nIn related news, the Center for American Progress issued a memo to supporters calling \"the legalization of persons in the country illegally a critical component of the Democratic Party's future electoral success\" and urged all Democrats in Congress \"to vote against any Republican attempts to fund the government that do not include a fix for Dreamers.\"\n\nTrump Named Top Enemy of Press\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) named Donald Trump the \"top global press oppressor.\" The award was considered an upset win. Regimes like China where journalists are jailed for criticizing the government, Turkey, which has surpassed China as the world's biggest jailer of journalists, and Russia where reporters frequently are murdered are expected to lodge protests.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan complained \"we have worked very hard to be the best oppressors. We have more reporters in prison than any other country. I could understand being edged out by Russia or China with their lengthy pedigrees for dealing with nettlesome journalists, but the United States? The biggest accomplishment I'm aware of was Obama's spying on journalists. That's NOTHING! The Committee is showing unfair favoritism.\"\n\nCPJ Executive Director Joel Simon defended the organization's selection of Trump, arguing that \"no other tyrant has done more to undermine our credibility. In fact, it could be argued that jailing or killing a reporter martyrs him and enhances the media's credibility. But Trump's tagging us with the 'fake news' label has caused more damage than any other regime has ever achieved.\"\n\nA recent study from the Pew Research Center seems to bear out Simon's contention. According to the study the US ranks first in the perception of media bias. Only 21% of Trump supporters think the media treats political issues fairly. Fifty-five percent of Trump opponents see the media as fairly dealing with political issues. The 34% spread is the largest in the world.\n\nMeanwhile, Project Veritas' covert recording of several Twitter's employees revealed them boasting about \"using shadow banning to censor conservatives, pro-Trumpers and others who tweet about God, guns, and America.\" Shadow banning conceals a customer's tweets from other users. The banned user is never notified and is unaware that his posts are being sidetracked to a dead end. Twitter Trust and Safety Policy Manager Olinda Hassan explained \"we're using our control of the medium to neutralize the enemies of social progress.\"\n\nTwitter's suppression of conservatives complements Google's partisan \"fact checking.\" Media outlets that lean right are tagged with a \"reviewed claims\" sidebar listing left-wing objections to the site's content disguised as \"fact checking.\" Media outlets that lean left like Vox, Slate, The Huffington Post, Daily Kos, Salon, and Mother Jones have no \"fact checking\" sidebars. Google gives The New York Times and The Washington Post sidebars showcasing the awards they have been given over the years. Google spokesman Sacca Kathair defended the bias, calling it \"our company's contribution in the battle to ensure that incorrect thinking is clearly labeled and that correct thinking is appropriately acknowledged.\"\n\nDems Denigrate Tax Cut\n\nThe wave of corporations announcing employee bonuses in the wake of the recently passed Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act was denigrated by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) as \"pathetic crumbs. These corporations are getting billions in tax cuts, but are only giving out a few thousand to employees.\"\n\nWhile the \"few thousand\" is a per employee figure, the total being paid out in bonuses is in the billions. So far, over two million employees are set to receive a bonus averaging up to $3,000 per worker. On top of these bonuses there will also be individual tax cuts. H &amp; R Block estimates that single taxpayers earning $40,000 per year would get to keep an additional $1,000 under the new law. Families earning $70,000 would keep an added $4,000.\n\n\"These piddling amounts won't improve the lives of the average American as much as we could've done if the government continued to take and spend the money for the greater good of all,\" Pelosi contended. \"Funds that selfish individuals will fritter away on gadgets, vacations, or other frivolous spending could've been used to support the rescue of more Middle East refugees, free abortions for all, or any number of other worthy causes at the discretion of Congress.\"\n\n\"Catering to crass greed, as this totally GOP legislation has done, insults the patriotism and collective solidarity of Americans,\" she continued. \"By shoving this money back in the pockets of the working class we are denying them the right and opportunity to participate in something greater than themselves. It is my belief that the loss of this opportunity will come back to hit the Republicans hard in the mid-term elections this November and in 2020 when our country's worst president is voted out of office, if he lasts that long.\"\n\nFellow warrior for progressive government Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) urged her state's voters \"to not be misled by the personal benefits of the tax cuts. Yes, some of you will get bonuses. Almost all of you will get a tax cut, and everyone will see lower electric rates as a result of this law. But remember, this narrowly focused law has nothing in it for those who choose not to work, pay no taxes, and refrain from consuming electricity from the polluting power companies. Democrats are the only ones voters can count on to defend our traditional way of life.\"\n\nMassachusetts power companies aren't the only ones planning on lowering rates because of the corporate tax cut. So far a half dozen companies\u2014Pepco, Delmarva, Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric, Pacific Power, Rocky Mountain Power, and Commonwealth Edison\u2014are asking for permission to lower electricity rates. More are expected to follow suit. Widespread lower electricity costs will complicate Democrat efforts to rally voters to their anti-tax cut cause.\n\nMeanwhile, New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) has decided he should \"redirect the state's public employees' pension fund investments to make a better world. We're sitting on billions of dollars that currently are invested in the stocks of companies engaged in businesses that are out-of-step with the progressive agenda. We have the power to use this money to reward companies that are in step. We owe it to the future of our children and the planet to use this power.\" The Suffolk County Association of Municipal Employees issued a report that predicts the Public Employees' Common Retirement Fund would lose $2.8 billion over the next 20 years if the Governor has his way.\n\nIn an alternative approach to revitalizing the economy and attaining social justice, the State of California has decided to offer financial aid to aspiring marijuana entrepreneurs. Preference will be given to minority applicants who have prison records. Greg Minor, Assistant to the City Administrator \u2013 Special Permits and Nuisance Abatement, explained that \"it makes sense to prioritize who gets the aid. Guys who have been incarcerated for trafficking in drugs know the product, know how to market it, and strike me as more likely to succeed. In addition, these ex-cons have paid their debt to society. Letting them go to the head of the line helps society pay its debt for the wrongs it has inflicted on these people.\"\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: January 14, 2018 Edition"}

Somehow, now we find ourselves in a school of thought that Communism is once again some miraculous answer. \n\nWhy did this happen? To be perfectly honest, most of the time I felt as though I was pretty middle of the road politically. Now I feel as though I'm cornered into being this 'right wing extremist' and I'm not sure why. How would people on the left benefit from Communism? They'd have to work hard to only receive a portion of their profit like everyone else. \n\nI was going to continue but I realized I was starting to ramble.

I cannot tell you how many poor people often scoff at the rich business owners because they are just lucky to have been born from wealthy parents. Hell I even see middle class people who are well off attacking the Bill Gates and other successes as lazy imbeciles who are just \"sitting on their butts all day long\" and they are hoarding wealth so it should be distributed.  I seen from the general populace, both poor and middle class, attack the capitalist system because business men aren't really doing hardwork nor are they producing anything of value.\n\nI will admit just for the sake of what I will say in a minute that I am not a conservative. I've been raised in a minarchist household that favors neither leftist nor rightest view but merely view government should have minimal interaction in everything from what movies you watch to visiting a brothel to AK47 owndership. So yes I already have views that are contradictory to conservative idealism.\n\nYet I could never understand the criticism \"business men are lazy because they inherited their richness\" and \"running a business is as easy as 123!\". Even before I started going into the stock market, I already had first hand experience of how running a business would be like via stays at my auntie (who I mentioned in one of the above reddit links, owns a restaurant). In addition to seeing the dangers and difficulties of kitchen cookings, everytime I stayed over I would always hear her at night getting enraged as she spoke on the phone as she was speaking with employees, partners, and other business associates about so many complex subjects such as paying the bills, trying to get a new insurance company's support, difficulties with kitchen equipment, etc. I could always see how stressed my auntie would be everytime she woke up before she drank coffee and took a bath.\n\nMind you my auntie is actually quite a successful business owner. At the time she already had a $1,000,000 (I was 14 when she had that amount) in one of her bank accounts and when I talked to her which was weeks before I tried to get into stocks and bonds recently, she told me she had amassed a little over $10 million in that specific bank account. This is not counting assets, her other bank account savings, etc. But I can see despite being merely 46, she's already full of gray hair (I'm only 22 just to put this into perspective).\n\nSo I was not naive to believe I'll get rich quick when I tried to enter stock market recently as I already know first hand how hard business can be. Yet even I was caught off guard at how simplistic stuff such as comparing different stocks in chart analysis could be.\n\nSo it makes me wonder why the politically left and anarchist as well as poor and many middle class people think running a business and investments is a cakewake? And why many of them think just because Trump was given a lot of cash to start business  by his already rich dad that it was easy as playing video games for him to run his enterprises?\n\nI mean has any one seen how Tom Kalinske left his job as CEO of Sega of America with grey hair just because the stress of company politics got him? Or how medical analysts are saying Steve Jobs had a relatively young death because of his diseases which they theorized was probably caused by being overworked running Apple?\n\nI would like your input conservatives!","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"How legit is the criticism that many current successful businessmen and investors inherited their wealth and/or company or came from educated upper middle class backgrounds?

It is true that governmentally Germany is an autocracy. But there has been a great deal more industrial freedom there than many of our old industrial communities. The German Government says we expect you to work out good results, to get together with the laborer, and yourselves decide what you are going to pay to the doctors who are to pass upon the health of the employes, and the amount of damages any employe merits. The Government insists upon a great amount of self-government by the people themselves.\n  \n&gt;\u201cI feel that by insistence upon proper housing conditions we shall indirectly approach this. I want to see the immigrant know that he has got to spend a certain amount of his money in decent housing; that he will not be allowed to live on $2.50 per month board basis.\n  \n&gt;\u201cLet us say to the immigrant not that we hope he will learn English, but that he has got to learn it. Let the immigrant who does not learn it go back. He has got to consider the interest of the United States or he should not stay here. He must be made to see that his opportunities in this country depend upon his knowing English and observing American standards. The employer cannot be permitted to regard him only as an industrial asset.\n  \n&gt;\u201cWe must in every way possible encourage the immigrant to rise, help him up, give him a chance to help himself. If we try to carry him he may well prove not well worth carrying. We must in turn insist upon his showing the same standard of fealty to this country and to join with us in raising the level of our common American citizenship.\n  \n&gt;\u201cIf I could I would have the kind of restriction which would not allow any immigrant to come here unless I was content that his grandchildren would be fellow-citizens of my grandchildren. They will not be so if he lives in a boarding house at $2.50 per month with ten other boarders and contracts tuberculosis and contributes to the next generation a body of citizens inferior not only morally and spiritually but also physically.\u201d\n  \nIn the past few months, we've seen quotes on immigration similar to this from Republican and Democratic presidents going back for nearly a hundred years, and this one from Roosevelt takes it back even further to 1907.  Don't let the left pretend to you like this is some new form of xenophobia taking hold in the conservative movement or part of some racist faction of Trump supporters.  It is none of those things.

{"author":"JohnSemmens","created_utc":1516435189,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"Senator Calls Trump \"Stalinesque\"\n\nThis week, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Az) compared President Trump to notorious Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin in a speech he gave to fellow Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn) in the Senate.\n\nDurbin characterized his colleague's remarks as \"moving and insightful. Considering that Trump is clearly a monster of prodigious magnitude, Jeff showed enormous courage speaking truth to power. Why, just the other day Trump used the s*** word to denigrate the governments that are so bad that they turn their citizens into refugees.\"\n\nKlobuchar praised Flake's defense of the media as \"a stellar effort in the battle against this country's worst president. Jeff is among the few Republicans willing to put Party aside for the greater good. We had hoped he could fill the shoes of his state's mortally ill senior Sen. John McCain, but sadly, the redneck voters in Arizona won't support his reelection.\"\n\nAfter his speech Flake admitted that \"Trump isn't anything like Stalin. Stalin had his enemies killed or imprisoned. Trump merely insults his with crude tweets and taunts. I evoked Stalin's name because I knew the media would be eager to cover my remarks if I did. And I was right. My audience's enthusiastic response assured me that I am on the right track and will get the kind of attention I so desperately need.\"\n\nArizona's Sen. McCain asserted \"I'm proud of Jeff for taking such a bold stand against his own party. It's a path I have trod often to great media acclaim. When you have no significant legislative achievements to show for a 40-year career, being an outspoken critic of the GOP is a good substitute for garnering notoriety. I can see how my success inspired Jeff. Unfortunately, he didn't have the advantage of being a war hero to divert Republican voters from his unpopular attacks on a Republican president.\"\n\nThe media that Flake so passionately defended bristled at the \"fake news\" awards bestowed by President Trump on Wednesday. The editors of the Washington Post called the awards \"disappointing. There weren't even plastic trophies\u2014just a list of erroneous stories put out by various networks and newspapers.\" CNN's Jim Acosta complained that \"focusing on only a top ten callously overlooks the thousands of other stories that we generated in our campaign against this madman. Whether a story is factually correct is not as important as whether it is politically correct. In that regard our record is unblemished.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, polls show that a majority of voters think the media are biased in their political coverage. More surprising is the admission by 45% of journalists that media coverage of Trump is biased.\n\nTrump Passes Physical, Media Skeptical\n\nThis week President Donald Trump underwent a full physical exam carried out by Dr. Ronny Jackson. Unusually, the exam included a test of cognitive abilities. The Doctor, who pronounced his patient to be in good health, was then subjected to a barrage of questions, 80 in all, from the media. A few are shown below.\n\nNBC News reporter Hallie Jackson wondered \"isn't Mr. Trump is too fat to be president? I mean, he's no Obama. He doesn't shoot hoops. He looks fat to me. Doesn't he look fat to you?\" \"The tests we conducted were aimed to objectively measure important attributes related to health,\" Jackson said. \"Regrettably, the data didn't address your essentially aesthetic concern.\"\n\nABC News chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl wanted to know \"how can a guy who eats McDonald's and fried chicken be in good shape?\" \"It's called genetics,\" Jackson replied.\n\nBrian Stelter, senior media correspondent for CNN, professed himself \"unpersuaded that Trump's apparent fitness should prevent going forward with a 25th Amendment effort to remove him from office.\"\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio dismissed Trump's physical as \"irrelevant. The quack that examined him overlooked the obvious fact that he is insane\u2014his behavior proves it. He is on the wrong side of every political issue. He naively believes that each individual is the best judge of what's in his own interests. He resists the essential truth that the collective whole of humanity is the relevant entity and that each person is merely a cell in this larger organism. It is crucial to this organism's survival that the cancer known as Donald Trump be excised.\"\n\nAdministration to Allow Doctors to Refuse to Perform Abortions\n\nThe Trump Administration is crafting new regulations that would reverse Obama Administration rules compelling doctors to perform abortions. The Department of Health and Human Services will establish a division of \"conscience and religious freedom protections\" within its Office for Civil Rights. Under the new rules, medical personnel could refuse to participate in procedures that violate their faith or conscience.\n\nAdora Slaughter, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called the reversal \"a betrayal of the rights granted to women by the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision and actualized by President Obama's Affordable Care Act. A woman who wants to terminate her pregnancy should not be forced to find a doctor willing to carry out the procedure. All doctors are licensed by the state. The government has a right and an obligation to require them to perform every kind of medical procedure approved by the AMA. To say that a doctor or nurse can refuse supplants the socially determined judgment of the state with the idiosyncratic judgment of selfish individuals. It's a step backward toward barbarism.\"\n\n\"The right to terminate an unwanted child is the most fundamental civil right,\" Slaughter added. \"That Health and Human Services would crush this right via an agency within the Office for Civil Rights stands justice on its head. It will condemn millions of women to unwanted motherhood\u2014effectively reintroducing the involuntary servitude that was abolished by the Civil War and the Constitution's 13th Amendment.\"\n\nIn related news, the US House of Representatives passed the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act by a vote of 241-183. The law would require doctors who perform an abortion in which the baby survives the procedure to render life-saving care to the infant. Every Republican voted for the bill. All but six Democrats voted against it.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), one of the \"no\" votes, explained his opposition saying, \"I see no need for the government to intrude upon the sacred procedure of terminating an unwanted life. I think we should allow people the freedom to decide what to do rather than letting an emotional appeal on behalf of the survivors of a botched abortion to overwhelm the need to balance the interests of all affected parties. The simplistic idea that the surviving child could be adopted, and thus solve the problem, ignores the fact that the birth mother will be haunted by the knowledge that a person she tried to kill still lives somewhere. No woman should have to endure such torment.\"\n\nPair of California Dems Want to Confiscate Business Tax Cut\n\nAssemblymen Kevin McCarty (D-Sacramento) and Phil Ting (D-San Francisco) are pushing a measure aimed at confiscating half of the business tax cuts resulting from the federal Tax Cuts &amp; Jobs Act for use by the state government.\n\n\"Businesses have been exploiting the workers and ripping off customers for too long,\" Ting complained. \"That Trump's tax cuts would now further reward them for their predatory behavior is unconscionable. Our measure would expropriate the expropriators and turn half of these unjust tax cuts over to the state for a more socially just redistribution.\"\n\nTing said he is not concerned that his proposed action might spark the departure of some businesses because \"that will leave more room for the state to expand its role in directing the utilization of our vast natural resources. The notion that entrepreneurs are of any use at this stage of history is misguided. By eliminating this unnecessary class of parasites the state can more effectively deploy assets that are wrongfully controlled by private interests and achieve the more equitable distribution of wealth foreseen by the great Karl Marx.\"\n\nThe two men's proposed lurch toward a more intensified degree of socialism for the State of California is not out-of-step with current state policies and programs. Despite an abundance of natural advantages, according to the Census Bureau, the state now has the highest percentage of inhabitants living in poverty of any state in the nation. High taxes, crippling regulations, and overly generous welfare programs have produced an environment where nearly 20% of the population is now below the poverty line.\n\nTing denied that these statistics reflected poorly on the state's socially progressive governing philosophy. \"If things were really so bad why would California be such a favored destination for immigrants?\" he asked. \"I would argue that the influx of these proletarian classes from south of the border affirms the correctness of our path and builds a strong political base for future advances along the same lines.\"\n\n\"Dreamers\" Maybe Aren't So Dreamy\n\nWhile Democrats are going all out to ensure that illegal aliens brought to the United States as children can stay and become citizens, it is not at all clear that they would make good citizens. The illegal executive action taken by former President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to unilaterally legalize these immigrants\u2014sometimes called \"dreamers\"--is set to expire in March. Congressional Democrats are threatening to shut down the federal government if Republicans won't take action to prevent this.\n\nThe usual assertion is that these illegal immigrants are as American as their natural born peers. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo) maintains that \"taking young people who were brought here through no fault of their own, and have never known another country, and kicking them out of America is as dumb as it is counterproductive.\"\n\nWell, maybe not. In Arizona, \"dreamers\" constitute an estimated 2% of the population. They also account for a disproportionately large 8% of the prison population. Illegal immigrants of all ages are 142% more likely to be convicted of a crime than other residents, but that figure rises to 250% among the 18-35 age group. They also tend to commit more serious crimes and are over-represented among convictions for murder, manslaughter, sexual assault and armed robbery.\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: January 21, 2018 Edition"}

I have, however, retained a few typically \"liberal\" stances, and I sometimes feel out of place in my conversations with other conservatives. If I believe that climate change is not only real, but perhaps the greatest threat to our country and planet as a whole, can I still call myself a conservative? I can't shake the fear that oil companies and other mega-industries are influencing the American people into refusing to even acknowledge the possibility that the destruction of our planet could make our lives much more difficult and expensive in the future. So my question is, is there a place for me, a pro-small-government, pro-tax cutting, firearm loving and sjw-despising American among the conservative populous? I'd love to know what you all think.\n-And one last thing, I am NOT the typical idiot who would believe the MSM about climate change.

As *Investor's Business Daily* [1.1](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/did-votes-by-noncitizens-cost-trump-the-2016-popular-vote-sure-looks-that-way/) put it, \n\n&gt;\"Democrats had extensive get-out-the-vote campaigns in areas heavily populated by illegal aliens. As far back as 2008, Obama made sure that those who wanted to vote knew it was safe, announcing that election records would not be cross-checked with immigration databases.\"\n\nYou can watch Obama on YouTube [1.2](https://youtu.be/oLLt-a6dI_0) glossing over the prospect of illegals voting.\n\nDemocrats in California have made it exceptionally easy to register to vote. So easy that literally anyone can do it. The California voter registration website [1.3](http://registertovote.ca.gov/) does not require a driver's license number or Social Security number. Go ahead, register all your pets, it's easy.\n\nThe Democrats have done this out of necessity. It comes naturally, as they have a history of tainting our election process. [1.4](http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/09/acorn.fraud.claims/) Without the massive influx of party-line votes from foreigners, their future in politics becomes questionable. This was so eloquently described by former Clinton campaign communications directer Jennifer Palmieri in a memo [1.5](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/08/playbook-democrats-daca-deal-327513) circulated by the left-wing Center for American Progress.\n\n&gt; \"The fight to protect Dreamers is not only a moral imperative, it is also a critical component of the Democratic Party\u2019s future electoral success.\"\n\nThere is in fact a coordinated campaign in government and media to promote the idea of illegal immigrants voting in our elections. [1.6](http://time.com/4859478/immigrant-voters-history/) [1.7](http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/california-forum/article165368987.html) They have already gained suffrange in certain municipalities in Maryland, Illinois, and California. [1.8](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/13/illegal-immigrants-get-ok-to-vote-in-maryland-citys-elections.html) [1.9](http://www.newsweek.com/immigrants-are-getting-right-vote-cities-across-america-664467) Attempts to investigate illegal voting have been met with adverse results, such as thousands of Colorado voters withdrawing their voter registrations in order to shield incriminating information from being collected by the voter fraud commission. [1.12](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/voters-registering-trump-administrations-data-requests/story?id=48578555&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn)\n\nWe've established that the Democrat leadership and their operatives have the means, motive, and opportunity to poison the integrity of our elections with fradulent and illegal votes. However, even if we suppose for the sake of argument that no illegal votes are cast, Democrats still benefit from illegal immigration. The distribution of representative seats and electoral college voteshare is determined by the census. This means the presence of non-citizens gives a state more political power in the federal govenment, at the expense of other states who do not recieve immigrants. [1.10](https://imgur.com/wDxcwb4) This gives Democrat strongholds even more incentive to import foreigners. This is shown by their objections to a proposed rule change that could scare illegal immigrants from completing the census. [1.11](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/16/trump-california-census-342116) \n\nThe debate over the existence of illegal votes does not occur on even ground. From the left-wing perspective, it is not possible to prove a negative. This theoretically puts the burden of proof on the accuser. However, while Californians will deny that illegal voting is widespead, they will also do nothing to investigate for themselves. All they need to do is wave away enough evidence to maintain plausible denibility. \n\nThis plausibility begins to fade once we take a look at some of the documented facts.\n\nOn May 29, 2017, the Public Interest Law Firm (PILF) [2.1a](https://publicinterestlegal.org/blog/alien-invasion-ii-sequel-discovery-cover-non-citizen-registration-voting-virginia/) [2.1b](https://publicinterestlegal.org/files/Alien-Invasion-II-FINAL.pdf) published a report that found:\n\n&gt;Virginia election officials quietly removed 5,556 voters for non-citizenship between 2011 and May 2017\n\n...\n\n&gt;1,852 of those removed as noncitizens cast ballots\n\nThese findings were repeated in both conservative [2.1c](https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/may/30/illegals-in-virginia-registered-vote-in-elections/) and liberal [2.1d](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/trump-election-commissioner-used-dubious-data-to-allege-an-alien-invasion/) publications.\n\nThe detection of the non-citizen voters was due to the DMV asking whether license applicants were citizens. Those who admitted to being non-citizens were cross referenced with voter rolls. It is worth noting that these removals required zero investigative effort. The Commonwealth of Virginia does not take any active measures to detect or identify non-citizen voting. We do not know how many license applicants lied by falsely claiming to be a citizen. We also do not know how many of the admitted non-citizens were registered to vote under a different identity. The Commonwealth of Virginia is certainly not interested in finding out either.\n\nFinding only a few thousand ballots is insignificant on a national scale. However, the situation in Virginia begs the question of just how widespread illegal voting might be. The left has published numerous studies [2.2a](https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/voter-fraud) [2.2b](https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/resources-voter-fraud-claims) showing that there are very few confirmed cases of voter impersonation or multiple voting. These studies all lack a similar query; what is the response rate when you ask the non-citizens directly if they vote? To date, I have only found two large scale surveys that have asked this question.\n\n*McLaughlin: National Hispanic Survey Results* - June 2013 [2.3](http://mclaughlinonline.com/lib/sitefiles/National_Hispanic_Presentation_06-21-13_-_FOR_RELEASE.pdf)\n\n800 Hispanic adults surveyed, 60% in Spanish language. Of note is page 68, where it states that 13% of non-citizens said they were regustered to vote. That statistic extrapolated to the entire US population would indicate massive systemic illegal voting.\n\n*Old Dominion University: Electoral Studies* - September, 2014 [2.4a](http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Do-Non-Citizens-Vote-in-US-Elections-Richman-et-al.pdf)\n\nUsing data collected for the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, (CCES) [2.4b](https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/) the professors analyzed the 339 non-citizen respondents. \n\n&gt;More than 14 percent of non-citizens in both the 2008 and 2010 samples indicated that they were registered to vote. Furthermore, some of these non-citizens voted. Our best guess, based upon extrapolations from the portion of the sample with a verified vote, is that 6.4 percent of non-citizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent of non-citizens voted in 2010.\n\nNaturally, such a damning analysis drew fire from the left, [2.4c](https://www.snopes.com/illegal-immigrants-2008-election/) most notably by the Harvard professor who was originally involved with the CCES. [2.4d](https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/news/perils-cherry-picking-low-frequency-events-large-sample-surveys) A footnote gives us a clue as to how they reached their conclusion.\n\n&gt; For the 2012 election, there is one validated voter among the 85 respondents who answered non-citizen in both waves. However, this appears to be the result of a false positive match with Catalist. Indeed, the individual stated in both the 2010 and 2012 survey that she was not registered to vote. \n\nIt is interesting that they rely on Catalist to \"verify\" the responses given by self-identified non-citizens in the CCES. Catalist is a Democrat-aligned voter database and demographic targeting company. There is absolutely no guarantee that they would have any of these non-citizens in their database, especially if the illegal voters are registered with an alias. Furthermore, it turns out that this company was started with Soros money. [2.4e](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalist) This casts serious doubt on any data provided (or not provided) by Catalist.\n\nThe authors of *Electoral Studies* had their rebuttal of the rebuttal published in the Washington Post. [2.4f](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/11/02/do-non-citizens-vote-in-u-s-elections-a-reply-to-our-critics/?utm_term=.b3543273a6bc) They make note of those 85 participants who indicated that they were non-citizens in both 2010 and 2012...\n\n&gt;However, 10 of the 85 consistent non-citizens indicated that \u201cI definitely voted in the General Election\u201d in 2012: a turnout rate of 11.7 percent. Indeed, this rate is on par with the highest point estimates reported in our article, providing support for our finding that some non-citizens report voting in U.S. elections.\n\n&gt;Non-citizen voters have incentives to misrepresent either their citizenship status or their voting status. After all, claiming to be both a non-citizen and a voter is confessing to vote fraud, and the Federal Voter Registration Application specifically threatens non-citizens who register with a series of consequences.\n\nThis means that the amount of *confessed* non-citizen voting is just the tip of an iceberg of unknown size. We will never know the true prevalence of this crime without some investigtion at the government level, which has been oddly difficult to inspire.\n\nSo what do Democrats say about this topic when they think no one is watching? James O'Keefe has given us a glimpse into how Democrat operatives manipulate our elections.\n\nFirst, he got Scott Foval, the field director for American United for Change, to admit to a litany of crimes. [3.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDc8PVCvfKs&amp;feature=youtu.be) Most interesting was the discussion surrounding the transportation of illegal voters to polling sites. Referring to Republicans, he had this to say:\n\n&gt; We've been bussing people in to deal with you fuckin' assholes and we're not going to stop now.\n\n[3.2](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/19/two-democratic-operatives-lose-jobs-after-james-okeefe-sting/?utm_term=.d5cec2f6d9c8)\n\n[3.3](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/10/18/project_veritas_exposes_organized_voter_fraud_on_a_massive_scale.html)\n\nThe second person of interest is Alan Shulkin, the Commissioner of the Manhattan Board of Elections. O'Keefe's people managed to get him on tape saying: [3.4](https://youtu.be/jUDTcxIqqM0)\n\n&gt;\u201cCertain neighborhoods in particular, they bus people around to vote.\u201d\n\n...\n\n&gt;\u201cThey put them in a bus and go poll site to poll site.\u201d\n\n[3.5](https://nypost.com/2016/10/14/the-election-official-who-spoke-his-mind-on-vote-fraud/)\n\nTo recap: Democrats have every motivation to encourage illegal voting, they fight to protect illegal voting, the polling statistics indicate illegal voting is widespread, and behind closed doors, they will admit to it.\n\n__________\nSOURCES\n\n[1.1] https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/did-votes-by-noncitizens-cost-trump-the-2016-popular-vote-sure-looks-that-way/\n\n[1.2] https://youtu.be/oLLt-a6dI_0\n\n[1.3] http://registertovote.ca.gov/\n\n[1.4] http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/09/acorn.fraud.claims/\n\n[1.5] https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/08/playbook-democrats-daca-deal-327513\n\n[1.6] http://time.com/4859478/immigrant-voters-history/\n\n[1.7] http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/california-forum/article165368987.html\n\n[1.8] http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/13/illegal-immigrants-get-ok-to-vote-in-maryland-citys-elections.html\n\n[1.9] http://www.newsweek.com/immigrants-are-getting-right-vote-cities-across-america-664467\n\n[1.10] https://imgur.com/wDxcwb4\n\n[1.11] https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/16/trump-california-census-342116\n\n[1.12] http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/voters-registering-trump-administrations-data-requests/story?id=48578555&amp;cid=social_twitter_abcn\n\n[2.1a] https://publicinterestlegal.org/blog/alien-invasion-ii-sequel-discovery-cover-non-citizen-registration-voting-virginia/\n\n[2.1b] https://publicinterestlegal.org/files/Alien-Invasion-II-FINAL.pdf\n\n[2.1c] https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/may/30/illegals-in-virginia-registered-vote-in-elections/\n\n[2.1d] http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/07/trump-election-commissioner-used-dubious-data-to-allege-an-alien-invasion/\n\n[2.2a] https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/voter-fraud\n\n[2.2b] https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/resources-voter-fraud-claims\n\n[2.3] http://mclaughlinonline.com/lib/sitefiles/National_Hispanic_Presentation_06-21-13_-_FOR_RELEASE.pdf\n\n[2.4a] http://www.judicialwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Do-Non-Citizens-Vote-in-US-Elections-Richman-et-al.pdf\n\n[2.4b] https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/\n\n[2.4c] https://www.snopes.com/illegal-immigrants-2008-election/\n\n[2.4d] https://cces.gov.harvard.edu/news/perils-cherry-picking-low-frequency-events-large-sample-surveys\n\n[2.4e] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalist\n\n[2.4f] https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/11/02/do-non-citizens-vote-in-u-s-elections-a-reply-to-our-critics/?utm_term=.b3543273a6bc\n\n[3.1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDc8PVCvfKs&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\n[3.2] https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/19/two-democratic-operatives-lose-jobs-after-james-okeefe-sting/?utm_term=.d5cec2f6d9c8\n\n[3.3] https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/10/18/project_veritas_exposes_organized_voter_fraud_on_a_massive_scale.html\n\n[3.4] https://youtu.be/jUDTcxIqqM0\n\n[3.5] https://nypost.com/2016/10/14/the-election-official-who-spoke-his-mind-on-vote-fraud/","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The case of illegal voting is still wide open.

{"author":"mjm19083","created_utc":1516768771,"num_comments":9,"score":46,"selftext":"Today I was coming back from a movie with my family and we were having a lovely time afterward talking about the movie and making jokes. my younger brother was driving a bit bad and I made an off-color old stereotype joke about driving. He stopped the car and point blank refused to keep driving because he was quote \"offended by the racism\". I was shocked when I learned that he wasn't joking he was dead serious so to keep the peace I apologized and we kept driving while he had a smug look on his face because he was happy that he won.\n\nThat in a nutshell is where we are today, feelings have become the new gold standard. The only currency that matters nowadays is offense taken or implied. I love my family dearly as many do, but they are so far to the left that Mao would be proud. I am the only conservative which I am reminded daily of my sins of thought. Not to mention that we are Latinos so whenever a immigration issue pops up my mother sees fit to jam it down my throat and heaven help me if I try to reason because her feelings come first. My siblings are the same in more social and economic matters, and regardless of how we debate or talk about it, logic and reason always and without fail take a backseat to feelings. \n\nIts not just in the family, where I live there is a very heavy bastion of liberalism a deep blue part of my state. Its bad enough that I am terrified of how I speak at school or out and about worried that I may say something that would clue them in on my political leanings or worse I voted Trump. at least until they get to know me and understand who I am as a person. More then one time I had to bail because I let down my guard and started having to deal with nazi this and nazi that. \n\nCensorship has been used by the far-right for many years to clamp down on media that was deemed offensive (rap, video games, etc). But those mediums survived and prospered because they were rallied by the left who championed their cause. Today the left owns popular media, they own practically all news outlets and they are all to happy to shut down peoples right to speech. I'm not a Nazi, Im a latino man who took care of his mother after she had a stroke, took care of my siblings after my father died. But because the media makes us all into monsters, my family turns its back on me when its convenient and my friends ignore me. \n\nThats the difference between conservatism and liberalism and why until the day I die I will be a conservative. I couldn't begin to care if your gay,straight, white, black because it doesn't matter what matters is your character and your attitude towards life unlike liberalism where if you dont fall into their very specific categories you are part of the problem and must be dealt with it. I'm tired of having to hear the same damn line \"how could you be a conservative you're latino\"But I deal with it because one day I hope there will come a day that the outdated beliefs of the left fall away to the trash heap of history and I dont have to be classified in a million different categories to please others, I can be only a proud, unapologetic american who loves his country to the day he dies.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Censorship in the Age of Trump (aka punching Nazis)"}

I support same-sex marriage, I support ending the war on drugs and legalizing almost all drugs, support legalizing prostitution and gambling, I'm content with transgender people as long as they don't force me to use pronouns, and I am against the death penalty.\n\nBut on other issues I tend to be kind of socially conservative; I'm against abortion, I do think that there should be laws in place to prohibit things like public nudity, incest, bestiality, pedophilia, euthanasia, so on.

{"author":"houseoftolstoy","created_utc":1516920675,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"We have been seeing a lot of commotion regarding how the Russians are a major threat to the United States from many of our media sources. Be it on Facebook buying $100,000 worth of advertisements, or on Twitter with bots that spread hashtags, the story goes that these attacks are a major atrocity; undermining the integrity of our elections; an assault on the sanctity of our democracy. Something seems to be amiss with these assertions that Russia is such a big threat due to their online influence and alleged misinformation capabilities. The issue lies not in whether or not all the charges are true about the Russians online, it is the underlying premise that these stories rely on.\n\n**The premise: the people that voted for Donald Trump are stupid, easily manipulated, and/or are willing pawns to the whims of the Russians.**\n\nThe implication by those on the Left that Americans who vote for candidates on the conservative side of the aisle are lacking in intelligence is not a new charge. For example, in the 2004 election, someone made a map of the United States divided in the categories of \u201cAmerica\u201d (states that went Democrat) and \u201cDumbfuckistan\u201d (states that went Republican). So when a #resistor sees the stories about supposed Russian interference (or meddling, or hacking, etc) was done in attempt to sway voters, this confirms their bias that conservatives are unintelligent. Of course the Facebook ads and Twitter bots had a huge impact on the election, because conservatives are so stupid that they will vote for Trump when they see an ad where Jesus is arm wrestling Satan! They are dumb enough to fall for this trickery by the Russians, so any reporting about Russian efforts confirms that this election was utterly compromised!\n\nTo say that this is insulting is quite the understatement. Are conservatives so mentally fragile in their stances that some Facebook advertisements or trending hashtags are going to impact their decision on who to vote for? \n\nAnd accounting for swing voters, would they also be counted in the same category if they voted for Donald Trump in this election? If the premise is that voters in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania were where most of these duped voters came from, given the unexpected swing in these states, is there an explanation for how these voters were previously not voting without proper reasoning in prior elections?\n\nDoes an advertisement really change your mind about anything? If you are a die-hard Chevy truck fan, is an advertisement that says Ford trucks are superior going to make you switch sides all the sudden? Chances are, that the Ford ad would either make you feel disgust as a Chevy fan or joy as a Ford fan (or indifference for those who are neither). \n\nIs a trending hashtag so powerful that it makes you completely change your opinions in politics, regardless of whether or not it is propped up by organic users or bots? When confronted with hashtags like #Resist, #MAGA, or #NotMyPresident; or Facebook ads from either side, the most likely reaction would be either support, disapproval, or indifference.\n\nThere is no way to prove or disprove that any voter changed their minds due to advertisements and hashtags, so the premise will never have any real confirmation or refutation. While we can see the number of people who clicked on or reacted to specific ads, it is not proof that hearts and minds shifted in their thought processes of how they voted. When the explanation that \u201cthousands/millions could have seen these ads and been influenced,\u201d is the only \u201cproof\u201d that the 2016 Presidential election was somehow illegitimate, it shows a major overestimation of the influence of advertisements and no respect for those who voted differently.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The Underlying Issue with all the Russian Influence news stories"}

We will use Trump's insulting proposal to win the 2018 elections, take back congress and advance the progress pf our efforts to oust the usurper.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) labeled Trump's proposal \"heartless. His plan is to give preference to the competent and productive among the dreamers when it is the incompetent and unproductive who are most in need of the benefits we can afford to provide. The welfare programs south of the border are pitifully inadequate. Trump would target those who seek the better life they can live under the generosity of our government for deportation. This is unconstitutionally both cruel and unusual punishment for the tens of millions who have endured the severe hardships of trekking across the border.\"\n\nIn related news, beginning April 1, illegal immigrants who have been granted driver's licenses in California will be allowed to vote. \"It's the next logical step in our state's battle against the Trump Administration's attempt to close our borders to immigrants,\" said Gov. Jerry Brown. \"The votes of these immigrants will ensure that the state will send Democrats to Congress to oppose Trump in 2018 and ensure that our electoral votes will go to Democrats from this point on.\"\n\nHouse Intel Memo Sparks Reaction\n\nA confidential memo written by Republicans from the House Intelligence Committee has sparked different reactions from Democrats and Republicans. Republicans who have read the memo describe its contents as \"shocking.\"\n\n\"The facts contained in this memo are jaw-dropping and demand full transparency,\" said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla). \"The widespread illegal surveillance of America citizens by the nation's intelligence community for what appear to be purely political motives is not the kind of behavior one expects in a free society. We need to release the memo so the American people have information they need to decide how they want their government to be run.\"\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va) acknowledged that he has not read the memo, but described it as \"sloppy, careless and has no grounding in fact. How do I know this? Well, for one, it was written by Republicans. For two, it alleges that members of the FBI would misuse their authority in a biased way to favor one Party over another.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Democrats, contents of some of the 50,000 text messages between FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI attorney Lisa Page discuss a plan to \"go easy\" on presidential candidate Hillary Clinton because, as Page pointed out \"she might be our next president. If we get on her bad side it could wreck our careers.\"\n\nStrzok replied that he \"agreed\" and said he contacted his FBI superior Bill Priestap, \"who also agrees with our perception.\" Strzok later revised then FBI Director James Comey's draft letter on the Clinton \"matter\" to change the description of her handling of classified emails from the legally culpable \"gross negligence\" to the vaguer, but safer \"extremely careless.\" All of this took place months before 17 witnesses and Clinton herself were even interviewed.\n\nWarner professed himself \"unmoved by these text exchanges. Considering that everyone was sure that Hillary would be the next president, it's understandable that they wouldn't want to rub her the wrong way. Putting their 'thumbs on the scale,' so to speak, would be a natural survival reflex in those circumstances.\"\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) disagreed with his senate colleague's \"casual attitude toward this serious breach of ethics by those high up in this country's foremost law enforcement agency. Justice requires the unbiased consideration of evidence. The decision to grant leniency to someone on the premise that the person is powerful is corrupt and conducive to tyranny. It cannot be allowed if we are to remain a free country.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, adamantly opposes letting the general public see the memo because \"they don't have the necessary knowledge or experience to adequately understand the seemingly inappropriate steps the intelligence community must take to defend the country from enemies both foreign and domestic. It is naive to think that a federal agent should remain unbiased when the very fate of the nation may require that 'dirty deeds' be done to save it.\"\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), ranking member on the House Committee on the Judiciary, demanded that \"the FBI be allowed to review the memo and correct any inaccuracies or take whatever other action it deems necessary to protect itself before it is released. Let's not forget that the FBI has been protecting this country since the Dillinger days. We shouldn't allow the squeamishness of a few Republicans about the FBI's methods to undermine public confidence in this great law enforcement agency.\"\n\nIn related news, a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court ruling found that 85% of the National Security Administration's (NSA) searches of individual American citizens during the Obama Administration violated the Constitution's Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches. In response, the NSA has deleted \"honesty\" and \"openness\" from its \"core values\" statement on its web page.\n\nThree States to Sue over New Tax Law\n\nNew York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that his state, New Jersey and Connecticut will be suing the federal government because \"the new tax law impedes our ability to extract the maximum amount of revenue from the taxpayers.\" The impediment comes from the clause in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that limits the deductibility of state and local taxes to a mere $10,000 per taxpayer per year.\n\nThe three states rank at the top of the list for heaviest tax burden as a percent of income with New York at 12.7%, Connecticut at 12.6% and New Jersey at 12.2%. The states also rank high in terms of household median income. But hey, isn't having the rich pay more in taxes the constant refrain of Democratic politicians whenever the issue is brought up?\n\nCuomo maintains that \"the state tax burden had been partially offset by the old federal tax code that allowed for lower tax states to pay a larger share of the federal tax burden than they otherwise would have. This was fair because these other states have lower state tax burdens, and thus, more money available to send to the federal government. Suddenly changing the rules like Congress and President Trump did was unfair. Our states have grown dependent on being able to shift the burden. Cutting us off is like throwing a family off of food stamps or out of public housing. It's an intolerable shock to the system.\"\n\nAside from the lawsuit, Cuomo says his state is considering switching from an income tax to a payroll tax. \"First, payroll taxes are deductible from federal taxes,\" he pointed out. \"Second, this will give a break to the high-income donors from Wall Street who donate the majority of the funds state Democrats receive for their election campaigns.\"\n\nIn related news, California Assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon (D-Whittier) has introduced a bill that would subject waiters who give customers a drinking straw without being asked to a fine of up to $1,000 per straw, up to six months in prison, or both. \"Plastic straws have been raping our environment for far too long,\" Calderone claims. \"Waiters are in a position to ameliorate this degradation if they take a more active role in deterring the over use of these weapons of mass desecration. My bill will provide a little more incentive for them to act more aggressively and responsibly.\"\n\nBaboons Escape from Paris Zoo\n\nA contingent of 52 baboons is reported to have escaped from the Paris Zoo. The animals are said to be \"large and potentially very aggressive.\" Authorities are reportedly uncertain about how this situation should be handled.\n\n\"On the one hand, there is concern that innocent civilians could be harmed by the animals or our efforts to try to recapture them,\" zoo manager Jean Pomfrite worried. \"On the other, there is some speculation that the streets would be safer if they are overrun by simians than Sunnis.\"\n\nFlorence Parly, Minister of the French Armed Forces, is said to be assembling a team to work on the terms of surrender. \"As we learned from some of our nation's previous encounters with hostile forces, it is better to prepare for peace than attempt to fight a battle we are unlikely to win,\" Parly maintained. \"We're confident that if things get really bad the United States can be counted on to come to our rescue. While others have often mocked us, I'd like to point out that our cost-effective approach has worked for France for more than 75 years\u2014saving us money that has been better spent on wine, bread and cigarettes.\"\n\nNAACP Disputes Trump's S***hole Description of Haiti\n\nThis week, NAACP spokesperson Secreta Stool sought to disprove President Trump's characterization of Haiti as a \"s***hole country.\"\n\n\"Statistics show otherwise,\" Stool asserted. \"Only 40% of the population has no access to indoor toilets. This means a majority use flush toilets. Among those unfortunates without indoor plumbing most just relieve themselves in the street, not a hole. So, a more accurate description of Haiti is that it is a cesspit of poverty, disease, and violence.\"\n\nStool said the NAACP has filed a defamation suit against the President. \"He has slandered and demoralized the people of this noble nation,\" he said. \"We are seeking immediate entry into the United States and free accommodation at a Trump hotel for every Haitian fleeing the country. Alternatively, the United States government can pay damages in the amount of $50 trillion.\"\n\nCNN Panel Credits Obama for Booming Economy\n\nIn the midst of widespread praise of President Trump's economic policies by world business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, a Cable News Network (CNN) panel mostly insisted that the credit for America's booming economy properly belongs to former President Obama.\n\nCNN International host Christiane Amanpour asserted that \"most of the people I talk to on a regular basis agree that President Obama is really the one responsible. It was his policy that ushered in the period of sacrifice and stagnation that made Trump's moves toward deregulation and tax cuts possible. Let's not forget that the eight years preceding Trump's inauguration were the only presidential term in US history where economic growth never reached 3% for a single year. This laid the groundwork for the current surge.\"\n\nCNN's Chief White House Correspondent Jim Acosta echoed Amanpour's remarks, saying that \"Trump is merely lucky to be in the right place at the right time. If it hadn't been for the efforts President Obama made to suppress excessive economic growth the impacts of Trump's policies would've been much more modest. Right now, the corporate fat cats are pleased, but whether any of the benefits trickle down to average folks remains to be seen.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" CNN's Early Start host and Chief Business Correspondent Christine Romans chimed in. \"The top 1% are benefiting immensely. Smaller benefits are being realized by the middle class\u2014a thousand dollar bonus here, a few thousand in tax cuts per household there. Everyone is getting richer, but the gains aren't equal. People on welfare aren't getting bonuses or tax cuts. Whether an unequal prosperity is better than the more equally shared sacrifice that President Obama tried to make the new norm is an open question.\"\n\nThe sole member of the seven-person panel willing to give Trump any credit was Steven Moore, Distinguished Visiting Fellow, Project for Economic Growth, at The Heritage Foundation. \"There can be no doubt that the Obama Administration's policies discouraged investment and growth,\" Moore observed. \"But to claim that these policies deserve the credit for the current surge in business investment and confidence is absurd. It's like saying that Obama's previous policy of placing the government's foot on the neck of the US economy merits more praise than Trump's moves to dislodge it. That is twisted and insane.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the count of companies awarding bonuses to employees because of the Trump tax cuts has now reached 250. Home Depot and Starbucks were the most recent firms to announce that their hourly employees would be sharing in the companies' good fortune due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: January 28, 2018 Edition"}

The aim of democrat leftist (progressives/liberals/socialists/communists, used interchangeably throughout this report) in America is to see EVERYTHING confiscated and controlled by the ruling elite in the government apparatchik (e.g. some of the most vile, delusory people: Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin, et al., and George Soros, Tom Steyer, Jeff Bezos, et al.).  This model has been in play for nearly a century and is very close to becoming a reality. \nWhen the leaders of the NEA (National Education Association, the national educator\u2019s union which requires membership to teach) states in their annual meeting, that our children, as early as kindergarten, need to be taught the virtues of communism, we are at a tipping point.  When the national propaganda media gets their \u201cnews\u201d that they report as gospel from the daily progressive\u2019s talking points, we are at a tipping point.  When over 94% of our higher learning institutions and universities are controlled and staffed by contemptible, devious socialists, teaching young, impressionable minds to hate America and embrace communism, we are at a tipping point.  When our politicians value communist ideology and creating voting blocs (i.e. more power and money) over the safety and concerns of U.S. Citizens, we are at a tipping point.  When fundamentally fictitious claims of racism, misogyny, xenophobia, etc. are commonly used to stifle free speech, we are at a tipping point.  When socialists promote vile mass murders (Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin, Vladimir Lenin, Margaret Sanger, et al.) as social mentors for our children and supplant religion and the Bible with \u201cRules for Radicals\u201d and Saul Alinsky\u2019s main tenet: \u201cThe ends justify ANY means\u201d, we are at a tipping point.  When our voting system has been overtaken by literally millions of illegal, misrepresented, and false votes being cast in every election cycle and we are assured that voter fraud is a myth and any attempt to ensure that one vote for one (living) citizen is considered racist, we are at a tipping point.\nWhile all of these are undeniably true, the specifics are appalling and aggregately the effects are devastating!   I will enumerate a few specifics which are all reliably sourced, to list them all would create an epic \u201cObamacare\u201d sized voluminous report, which I will avoid. \n1.)\tThis one is completely irrational, inexplicable and incomprehensible, but a MAJOR victory for liberals (and exhibits page by page tactics from \u201cRules for Radicals\u201d).  The Republican Party is racist.  The point of fact is the Democratic Party owns, institutionalized, and implemented every racist/segregationist/enslavement/eugenicist act in America, from pre-civil war confederacy until now.  The Republican Party was created as the Abolitionist (antislavery/antidemocrat) Political Movement, and Minority alignment with the Democrats today is fundamentally, historically wrong and unimaginable.  The Republican Party has been responsible for creating and voting for all Civil Rights legislation that have been enacted, the Democratic Party is responsible for declaring enslaved African Americans as 3/5\u2019s of person clause in the Constitution.  I personally have found that within my numerous acquaintances that Democrats today express far more racist views than Republicans, not a scientific study but an incontrovertible fact.  Liberals today get a pass on every racist act they commit, e.g. referring to African Americans as the n-word repeatedly, and statements like \u201cputting you back in chains\u201d (which refers to what the Democrats did in the first place), to referring to Hispanic voters as the \u201ctaco bowl\u201d happen routinely, with no repercussions or consequences.\n2.)\tThe liberals care for immigrants (predominantly illegal), minorities, women, the elderly, children, LGBTQ, the poor and infirmed.  Unequivocally they do not (unless it\u2019s time to vote). They have proven time and time and time and time again:  in their actions, their statements and their indifference.  If they can\u2019t control your activities, your income, your status, your opinions, and most significantly, your vote, they could care a flying F about you, your family and your life.  Upon closer analysis, you will note a trend in liberal behavior:  illegal immigrants \u2013 as recently revealed (repetitively) the ONLY reason Democrats have taken up this cause is to gain votes, PERIOD, END OF STORY.  Minorities \u2013 look at liberal inner city policies over the last 60+ years that have created overwhelming inequality, squalor, violence, unprecedented murder and death and no future for children.  They have constantly pitted African Americans against (mostly) Hispanic and Asian immigrants, for some unknown and ill-conceived purpose.  My people have possibly the greatest grievance with our government \u2013 I am mostly Native American, and besides the death, destruction, confiscation of land, and crushing encumbrances imposed by the government and endured by our people, I personally do not know of even one Native American that does not love America dearly.  The liberals do not even give an honorable mention to Native Americans (there are too few of us left to create a sizable voting bloc, so we have become irrelevant to the socialists). The Jewish Communities, liberals HATE Israel and barely conceal their long history of anti-Semitism.  Women, please just look at how women have been mistreated, assaulted and abused in Hollywood, Washington political circles, the media, and now the tech industry - all of these are dominated by white, liberal men.  They make no excuse for this behavior and desperately want to acknowledge and move on, but the fact remains that there is a underlying pervasive attitude that these despicable creatures operate under and that is that all women are somehow inferior (and by nature, fair game) to these male liberal lechers, an attitude which unfortunately is not going to change from within these bastions of socialism.  Children \u2013 one of the main precepts of communism is population control and with millions of children/babies killed each year (predominately African American babies), fully and enthusiastically supported by liberals, we unquestionably know where children\u2019s value exists in their liberal pantheon, and that\u2019s with organs and tissue on the open market.  LGBTQ, have not achieved the universal acceptance they desired under ANY socialist program, and in fact most socialist/communist societies routinely imprison or execute members of the LGBTQ society. The elderly, the poor and the infirmed, has any socialist inspired program improved anyone\u2019s life, no. Look at Obamacare, took approximately 10 million insured and dropped them from existing insurance, then claimed to have added approximately 15 million to the roles of Obamacare (which, in truth, the vast majority were added to existing Medicaid programs), universally restricted access to facilities and medical personnel, increased premiums and drove copays and deductibles to astronomical levels, and did not do ANYTHING that was promised, and even today the liberals tout Obamacare as wildly successful.    \n3.)\tThe \u201cDeep State\u201d/swamp exists and is the status quo in Washington DC politics today.  The media/liberals deny this, but everyone (including myself) who has anything to do with the government, knows this to be part of everyday life inside the beltway.  As Hollywood, Academia, and the propaganda media have done for decades, the government in the past 9 years has implemented a silent \u201cconservative/Republican\u201d hiring impasse for the vast majority of federal positions.  This is a fact, often concealed under the guise of: \u201cnon-conformance of position requirements\u201d, \u201cinconsistencies\u201d, \u201cqualifications outside the scope\u201d or with the FBI/Intel Communities: \u201cinconclusive polygraph results\u201d.   This is vast and rampant discrimination based solely on political affiliation, which affect [sic] people of all races, ethnicities, gender and especially our veterans.\n4.)\tNew revelations have recently come to light that the previous administration of President Obama, illegally misused our intelligence organizations and our federal law enforcement agencies for the express purpose of spying on U.S. Citizens to influence, intimidate and corrupt the outcome of a Presidential Election.  This is the definition of \u201ccollusion\u201d and falls under the category of high crimes that demand indictments and incarceration. Crimes of this magnitude have never occurred in our Republic before and mirror exactly what Soviet style KGB operatives would conduct on their own people.  As for the investigation by Special counsel Robert Mueller into purported collusion by then candidate Donald Trump and Russia has produced no evidence of wrongdoing, has cost untold millions of dollars and is now moving into an obstruction of justice phase.  This too will lead to no wrongdoing (by President Trump), but will possibly lead to an indictment of former FBI Director James Comey and former Chief of the Counterespionage Section Peter Strzok who have proven their subjectivity and partisan inclinations dangerously influenced their decisions and actions during an active investigation.  Unfortunately a few of President Trump\u2019s campaign team and/or transition team may be charged for \u201cprocess\u201d crimes -  crimes perceived to have happened after the investigation started and as part of the investigatory process.  To examine the classic, true nature of Obstruction of Justice look no further than the massive FBI investigation into the Clinton/Gore illegal Chinese campaign contributions \u2013 can anyone recall the outcome of that investigation, absolutely not!  There was no outcome, there were literally hundreds of thousands of pieces of evidence that the Clinton campaign sold the presidency to the Chinese government for nearly $100 million dollars. Handwritten notes by Bill Clinton and Al Gore on napkins, promising intel and technology to the Chinese once Clinton/Gore were back in office. An absolutely watertight case was built against them, until then Attorney General Janet Reno stepped in and didn\u2019t officially stop or hinder the investigation, she just \u201crepurposed\u201d the funding for the investigation to another \u201chigher priority\u201d project. The investigation withered and died, no criminal indictments, no charges of obstruction of justice, when there should have been both.  How do I know this, I was right in the middle of it as it unfolded.\n5.)\tPresident Barack Hussein Obama was irrefutably the most inept, deceitful president in modern history.  At the very onset of his administration, with the Deepwater Horizon accident he could not abate the most ruinous environmental catastrophe the world has ever witnessed. Either through incompetence or complicity with BP, he allowed billions (if not trillions) of gallons of crude oil to continue to inundate the Gulf of Mexico, unchecked for 3 months.  A decade later this is still having deleterious effects on the entire region.  Very soon after this first disaster, he implemented his next maladroit act, the nearly trillion dollar \u201cshovel ready\u201d infrastructure stimulus.  This stimulus did nothing for America\u2019s roads, bridges, or any infrastructure projects, but did enrich his donors and cronies tremendously.  In fact according to federal records of the Recovery Act, only 40% of the trillion dollars were accounted for.  Every taxpaying Citizen should be demanding to know where the other nearly $600 billion went.  President Obama lied EVERY time he spoke to America, behind the podium, in front of the cameras, in every instance he would in Washingtonese, misstate the facts.  Yet the media would rarely \u201cfact check\u201d his misrepresentations and quite frequently would continue disseminating his misstatements.  The sources of this fact are his own videos and transcripts, as an exercise, pick any one of them and actually listen to the verbiage he used and you will find falsehoods in each and every one of them.  Juxtapose that with how the media portrays President Donald John Trump, \u201cfact checking\u201d every spoken word and unanimously concluding that he is lying, without any justification or indignity, but with an overabundance of hypocrisy.  \nThe only thing that is preventing this from becoming the new, stark reality, is \u201cWe The People\u201d, and the weapons at our disposal are to organize and to vote!\n\n\n","subreddit":"u_StreetCounterculture","title":"Report: SOPUS (State of Politics in the US)""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Report: SOPUS (State of Politics in the US)"}

This model has been in play for nearly a century and is very close to becoming a reality. \nWhen the leaders of the NEA (National Education Association, the national educator\u2019s union which requires membership to teach) states in their annual meeting, that our children, as early as kindergarten, need to be taught the virtues of communism, we are at a tipping point.  When the national propaganda media gets their \u201cnews\u201d that they report as gospel from the daily progressive\u2019s talking points, we are at a tipping point.  When over 94% of our higher learning institutions and universities are controlled and staffed by contemptible, devious socialists, teaching young, impressionable minds to hate America and embrace communism, we are at a tipping point.  When our politicians value communist ideology and creating voting blocs (i.e. more power and money) over the safety and concerns of U.S. Citizens, we are at a tipping point.  When fundamentally fictitious claims of racism, misogyny, xenophobia, etc. are commonly used to stifle free speech, we are at a tipping point.  When socialists promote vile mass murders (Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin, Vladimir Lenin, Margaret Sanger, et al.) as social mentors for our children and supplant religion and the Bible with \u201cRules for Radicals\u201d and Saul Alinsky\u2019s main tenet: \u201cThe ends justify ANY means\u201d, we are at a tipping point.  When our voting system has been overtaken by literally millions of illegal, misrepresented, and false votes being cast in every election cycle and we are assured that voter fraud is a myth and any attempt to ensure that one vote for one (living) citizen is considered racist, we are at a tipping point.\nWhile all of these are undeniably true, the specifics are appalling and aggregately the effects are devastating!   I will enumerate a few specifics which are all reliably sourced, to list them all would create an epic \u201cObamacare\u201d sized voluminous report, which I will avoid. \n1.)\tThis one is completely irrational, inexplicable and incomprehensible, but a MAJOR victory for liberals (and exhibits page by page tactics from \u201cRules for Radicals\u201d).  The Republican Party is racist.  The point of fact is the Democratic Party owns, institutionalized, and implemented every racist/segregationist/enslavement/eugenicist act in America, from pre-civil war confederacy until now.  The Republican Party was created as the Abolitionist (antislavery/antidemocrat) Political Movement, and Minority alignment with the Democrats today is fundamentally, historically wrong and unimaginable.  The Republican Party has been responsible for creating and voting for all Civil Rights legislation that have been enacted, the Democratic Party is responsible for declaring enslaved African Americans as 3/5\u2019s of person clause in the Constitution.  I personally have found that within my numerous acquaintances that Democrats today express far more racist views than Republicans, not a scientific study but an incontrovertible fact.  Liberals today get a pass on every racist act they commit, e.g. referring to African Americans as the n-word repeatedly, and statements like \u201cputting you back in chains\u201d (which refers to what the Democrats did in the first place), to referring to Hispanic voters as the \u201ctaco bowl\u201d happen routinely, with no repercussions or consequences.\n2.)\tThe liberals care for immigrants (predominantly illegal), minorities, women, the elderly, children, LGBTQ, the poor and infirmed.  Unequivocally they do not (unless it\u2019s time to vote). They have proven time and time and time and time again:  in their actions, their statements and their indifference.  If they can\u2019t control your activities, your income, your status, your opinions, and most significantly, your vote, they could care a flying F about you, your family and your life.  Upon closer analysis, you will note a trend in liberal behavior:  illegal immigrants \u2013 as recently revealed (repetitively) the ONLY reason Democrats have taken up this cause is to gain votes, PERIOD, END OF STORY.  Minorities \u2013 look at liberal inner city policies over the last 60+ years that have created overwhelming inequality, squalor, violence, unprecedented murder and death and no future for children.  They have constantly pitted African Americans against (mostly) Hispanic and Asian immigrants, for some unknown and ill-conceived purpose.  My people have possibly the greatest grievance with our government \u2013 I am mostly Native American, and besides the death, destruction, confiscation of land, and crushing encumbrances imposed by the government and endured by our people, I personally do not know of even one Native American that does not love America dearly.  The liberals do not even give an honorable mention to Native Americans (there are too few of us left to create a sizable voting bloc, so we have become irrelevant to the socialists). The Jewish Communities, liberals HATE Israel and barely conceal their long history of anti-Semitism.  Women, please just look at how women have been mistreated, assaulted and abused in Hollywood, Washington political circles, the media, and now the tech industry - all of these are dominated by white, liberal men.  They make no excuse for this behavior and desperately want to acknowledge and move on, but the fact remains that there is a underlying pervasive attitude that these despicable creatures operate under and that is that all women are somehow inferior (and by nature, fair game) to these male liberal lechers, an attitude which unfortunately is not going to change from within these bastions of socialism.  Children \u2013 one of the main precepts of communism is population control and with millions of children/babies killed each year (predominately African American babies), fully and enthusiastically supported by liberals, we unquestionably know where children\u2019s value exists in their liberal pantheon, and that\u2019s with organs and tissue on the open market.  LGBTQ, have not achieved the universal acceptance they desired under ANY socialist program, and in fact most socialist/communist societies routinely imprison or execute members of the LGBTQ society. The elderly, the poor and the infirmed, has any socialist inspired program improved anyone\u2019s life, no. Look at Obamacare, took approximately 10 million insured and dropped them from existing insurance, then claimed to have added approximately 15 million to the roles of Obamacare (which, in truth, the vast majority were added to existing Medicaid programs), universally restricted access to facilities and medical personnel, increased premiums and drove copays and deductibles to astronomical levels, and did not do ANYTHING that was promised, and even today the liberals tout Obamacare as wildly successful.    \n3.)\tThe \u201cDeep State\u201d/swamp exists and is the status quo in Washington DC politics today.  The media/liberals deny this, but everyone (including myself) who has anything to do with the government, knows this to be part of everyday life inside the beltway.  As Hollywood, Academia, and the propaganda media have done for decades, the government in the past 9 years has implemented a silent \u201cconservative/Republican\u201d hiring impasse for the vast majority of federal positions.  This is a fact, often concealed under the guise of: \u201cnon-conformance of position requirements\u201d, \u201cinconsistencies\u201d, \u201cqualifications outside the scope\u201d or with the FBI/Intel Communities: \u201cinconclusive polygraph results\u201d.   This is vast and rampant discrimination based solely on political affiliation, which affect [sic] people of all races, ethnicities, gender and especially our veterans.\n4.)\tNew revelations have recently come to light that the previous administration of President Obama, illegally misused our intelligence organizations and our federal law enforcement agencies for the express purpose of spying on U.S. Citizens to influence, intimidate and corrupt the outcome of a Presidential Election.  This is the definition of \u201ccollusion\u201d and falls under the category of high crimes that demand indictments and incarceration. Crimes of this magnitude have never occurred in our Republic before and mirror exactly what Soviet style KGB operatives would conduct on their own people.  As for the investigation by Special counsel Robert Mueller into purported collusion by then candidate Donald Trump and Russia has produced no evidence of wrongdoing, has cost untold millions of dollars and is now moving into an obstruction of justice phase.  This too will lead to no wrongdoing (by President Trump), but will possibly lead to an indictment of former FBI Director James Comey and former Chief of the Counterespionage Section Peter Strzok who have proven their subjectivity and partisan inclinations dangerously influenced their decisions and actions during an active investigation.  Unfortunately a few of President Trump\u2019s campaign team and/or transition team may be charged for \u201cprocess\u201d crimes -  crimes perceived to have happened after the investigation started and as part of the investigatory process.  To examine the classic, true nature of Obstruction of Justice look no further than the massive FBI investigation into the Clinton/Gore illegal Chinese campaign contributions \u2013 can anyone recall the outcome of that investigation, absolutely not!  There was no outcome, there were literally hundreds of thousands of pieces of evidence that the Clinton campaign sold the presidency to the Chinese government for nearly $100 million dollars. Handwritten notes by Bill Clinton and Al Gore on napkins, promising intel and technology to the Chinese once Clinton/Gore were back in office. An absolutely watertight case was built against them, until then Attorney General Janet Reno stepped in and didn\u2019t officially stop or hinder the investigation, she just \u201crepurposed\u201d the funding for the investigation to another \u201chigher priority\u201d project. The investigation withered and died, no criminal indictments, no charges of obstruction of justice, when there should have been both.  How do I know this, I was right in the middle of it as it unfolded.\n5.)\tPresident Barack Hussein Obama was irrefutably the most inept, deceitful president in modern history.  At the very onset of his administration, with the Deepwater Horizon accident he could not abate the most ruinous environmental catastrophe the world has ever witnessed. Either through incompetence or complicity with BP, he allowed billions (if not trillions) of gallons of crude oil to continue to inundate the Gulf of Mexico, unchecked for 3 months.  A decade later this is still having deleterious effects on the entire region.  Very soon after this first disaster, he implemented his next maladroit act, the nearly trillion dollar \u201cshovel ready\u201d infrastructure stimulus.  This stimulus did nothing for America\u2019s roads, bridges, or any infrastructure projects, but did enrich his donors and cronies tremendously.  In fact according to federal records of the Recovery Act, only 40% of the trillion dollars were accounted for.  Every taxpaying Citizen should be demanding to know where the other nearly $600 billion went.  President Obama lied EVERY time he spoke to America, behind the podium, in front of the cameras, in every instance he would in Washingtonese, misstate the facts.  Yet the media would rarely \u201cfact check\u201d his misrepresentations and quite frequently would continue disseminating his misstatements.  The sources of this fact are his own videos and transcripts, as an exercise, pick any one of them and actually listen to the verbiage he used and you will find falsehoods in each and every one of them.  Juxtapose that with how the media portrays President Donald John Trump, \u201cfact checking\u201d every spoken word and unanimously concluding that he is lying, without any justification or indignity, but with an overabundance of hypocrisy.  \nThe only thing that is preventing this from becoming the new, stark reality, is \u201cWe The People\u201d, and the weapons at our disposal are to organize and to vote!\n\n\n","subreddit":"u_StreetCounterculture","title":"Report: SOPUS (State of Politics in the US)""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Report: SOPUS (State of Politics in the US)"}

Her parents are multi-millionaires who live in a massive house while I went to school where there were more police officers on campus than teachers. And you might say, well maybe she was just a stronger applicant. The issue with that is I have an SAT of 1540 while hers was 1310 (you need a 1300 to even apply). I had almost straight A's and she was mostly B's and C's. I was an Eagle Scout, leader within the community and various clubs around my school, captain of a state championship cross country team and won an international business competition with hundreds of thousands of competitors all while I worked 25 hours a week at a part time job and had an internship over the summer. She threw ragers and played Civ all day every day. I read her application essay and it was based on why it sometimes sucks to be rich.

I know that if my application had said \"Black Female\" I would have been accepted. And unfortunately nothing can be done about it. So the child of two millionaires gets a full ride while I will have to go to community college for two years because I have had to help put food on my parents table and no matter how hard I have worked, or had worked, the race and sex on my application have put me below that of a person who couldn't be less qualified.
