{"author":"legendarysammy","created_utc":1538420071,"num_comments":1,"score":10,"selftext":"the MeToo mob justice mentality has shifted the justice system to being \"guilty until proven innocent\" for any sexual assault allegations so it seems. \n\nThe only reason this should even be considered is due to the assumption that disproving an innocent party would be easier than proving a guilty party. The problem that arises is that there is not enough evidence in a lot of cases to do either. The end result may be that more guilty offenders go to prison, but it would be at the expense of more innocents being sent as well. Think of all the people who have been exonerated from life imprisonment after DNA testings after spending decades in jail for crimes they didn't commit. One of the purposes of necessitating evidence of guilt rather than innocence is to make sure that as few innocent people as possible are jailed. If a policy like this was implemented it would change the fundamental purpose of our legal system in a terrible way. \n\n\\*\\*As a college student, I found the \"WitchHunt Hysteria\" against Kavanaugh on social media absolutely repulsive. A person who hasn't bothered to tune in to the trial itself would automatically think that Brett K. was a lying rapist with all the soundbites and insane angry pictures that the media show of him. It was only after i watched the full trial myself did i realize how fucked up and dangerous mob mentality can be. Graham's senate speech truly struck a chord amongst many conservatives i'm sure. anyways, i was pretty neutral on my standings and tried to keep an \"open mind\" when it came to politics but this was the last straw. Me and my whole family voting red this election. May justice come forth. ","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The MeToo movement has gone too far"}

I want to have this coment ready next time discusions like this pop up in r\/all like they have often been lately.      \n       \n     \nExample:        \n        \n     \n**My issue is that the accusation against Kavanaugh almost seems designed to be unfalsifiable.**\n\n1. Every single alleged witness claimed under oath that they do not recall any such party ever happening, meaning that no one can claim Brett did or didn't go upstairs into a room with her. (That's 4 vs 1)      \n2. She forgot when it happened, meaning Brett cannot find an airtight alibi for an unknown date.       \n3. She forgot whose house or whose party it was. Meaning the owner or party planner cannot corroborate if there even was a party at the house.     \n4. She forgot who took her to the party and who took her home. Meaning the driver also could not corroborate if the party ever occurred, or her emotional state before and after leaving this party.  This is especially troubling because she said this was the most traumatic experience of her life, and was seared into her memory.  Yet she forgot who took her home after rushing to leave the house. This would have been her savior from this situation and would have likely known some details about how she was acting and why she wanted to leave in such a rush.\n5. She left without anyone noticing. Meaning no one can say they did or did not see her escape the house.    \n6.  She didn't tell anyone immediately (or even in any remotely timely manner), meaning no one can confirm she confided in them at the time.  The only person was her therapist many years later about a vague encounter where she didn't specify the name if who it was that assaulted her.     \n7.  Just about every detail that could be looked at with an investigation was either forgotten, or very vague.\n      \n      \n**Some Inconsistencies**      \n     \n-Before her official statement she said there was another bystandard present in the room other than Mark Judge, in her official testimony it was only Mark Judge.   \n     \n-originally said Kavanaugh pushed her into the room, then said she didn't know who pushed her into the room (picky I know, but considering that she remembered exactly how many beers she had (1), and that whoever pushed her into the room would be almost as bad as the assailant, and that she said the assault was \"seared into her memory\" it seems just a bit weird)\n       \n-She said when she and her husband visited the therapist they were arguing about installing a second front door. This was in 2012.  Polo Alto building permit shows the door was installed in 2008.      \n      \n-Initially she said there were 4 people in the room during thr attack. In her official testimony she said it was only 2 others, including Kavanaugh.    \n         \n     \n**Other questions**:     \n      \nThe timing of all this, why she went to Democratic senators instead of law enforcement, and that she has received a lot if money from ordeal, all beg questions.\n        \n      \n       \n      \n\nAfter having acquired 10 days to iron out her story, she delayed testifying under the pretense of a fear of flying, (which is convientient given how she recently flew for both business and pleasure, and had a history of flying for both.)  A story so perfectly unfalsifiable with so many inconvenient details being conveniently forgotten seems EXTREMELY suspect.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I want to compile some knowledge about the Kavanaugh case."}

{"author":"MattMeduri","created_utc":1538506430,"num_comments":0,"score":8,"selftext":"So this is my third Senate map I'm releasing, the first one actually Post-Labour Day. We find republicans still heavily favoured to hold the chamber. This update, two ratings changes benefit republicans, while one benefits the democrats.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a political junkie. I called all 50 states in the 2016 Election. I go by national and state environments, incumbency advantage (if any), partisan tilts, approval ratings of incumbents, electoral history, and some polling. Mind you, I take polling with a grain of salt. And you should too...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Safe D: CA, HI, WA, NM, MN, VA, MD, DE, CT, NY, RI, MA, VT, ME**\n\n**Safe R: UT, WY, NE, MS**\n\n**Likely D: MI, PA**\n\n**Likely R: Texas, Mississippi (Special)**\n\n**Leans D: Wisconsin**\n\n**Leans R: Tennessee**\n\n**Tilts D: West Virginia, Minnesota (Special)**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBreakdown of Notable Races:\n\n1. **California**  \\- Nothing really shocking here except that **Kevin de Leon (D)** managed to halve **Sen. Dianne Feinstein's\\* (D)** lead in the polls. A recent poll showed them tied with the Latino vote, and another showed de Leon winning more republicans, despite being more progressive. Obviously California will end up with a democratic Senator either way, but it's an interesting development paralleled to the governor's race.\n2. Candidates are essentially in dead heat in **Arizona, Tennessee, and Florida**, according to polls. Trump just had a *huge* rally in **Johnson City, Tennessee**, and I've already given my skepticism on the competitiveness of that Senate race. The state is too far to the right to elect a democrat in this environment, even if that democrat (Bredesen) is the last dem. to date to win a statewide race *and* carry every county. Primary results show much more republican enthusiasm, as Blackburn received more votes for herself than the entire democratic turnout. **Prediction: Blackburn wins 5-9% on Election Day**\n3. Republicans aren't quite getting the development they want in **Michigan. John James (R)** started whittling away at **Debbie Stabenow \\* (D)'s** lead, getting her to as low as **+13.** Unfortunately, we haven't see much that indicates this race going anywhere. I still think James is the best candidate the GOP could have reared for this, and I think his nomination is indicative of Trump's influence in elections. Stabenow will likely face her closest re-election bid to the Senate yet, but that's just it. She's *likely* to win. I say she wins this race **7%-14% on Election Day**\n4. In **Texas,** democrats are energized by **Beto O'Rourke (D-TX16)** but the prospect of him carrying this seat, in a year like this, still remains low. Republican enthusiasm is as high as it was during the **2010 Red Wave**, and that was *before* this whole Kavanaugh ordeal. Cruz should be fine. I say he wins this race **8%-13% on Election Day.**\n5. **Minnesota Special -** Minnesota, as well know, is in the eye of the hurricane this cycle. We also know that interim Senators have **awful track records with reelection.** Take **Luther Strange (R-AL)** as an example. He didn't even win the primary. I'm weighting that factor a little heavier than other people, but I'm also combining that with the fact that **5 of the 8 US House races** there are seen as competitive this year. Republicans could easily turn the curren 5-3 democratic majority in a **4-4** even, a **5-3**, or even a **6-2** (little harder) for themselves. Pile that on with a contentious governor's race with no incumbency advantage, and you've got a state ready to flip to some degree. Trump also ran the closest race here since the last time a republican presidential candidate won it - **Richard Nixon in 1972** \\- and he only visited the state a handful of times. **Karin Housely (R)** is not a Washington-insider and is centrist enough to fit the state's politics. This is another instance in which dems created a problem that they shouldn't have had to worry about. By making **Al Franken (D)** take on for the team to create a precedent on sexual harassment to make Trump look stupid, they may have unintentionally tossed one of their seats. In the least-likely scenario of a **60+ filibuster-proof majority, Minnesota (S) is on that map.** Even in the more conventional realm, a flip in Minnesota is still a plausible outcome.\n\n**Ratings Changes: 3**\n\n1. **Ohio -** Ohio held by **Sherrod Brown\\* (D)** seems to be more and more likely and **Jim Renacci (R-OH16)** continues his \"campaign.\" Renacci attacks Brown for being  Washington-insider for 30 years, when he himself is also a Washington-insider. The economy has been great to Ohio, but Renacci just doesn't have the charisma or the resume to take on Brown. In a swing state like Ohio, where **Rob Portman\\* (R)** easily beat out **Ted Strickland (D)** in 2016, I say this is Brown's race to lose. Prediction: **Brown wins 7%-13% on Election Day.**\n2. **New Jersey -** By all conventional wisdom, this race should by and large *not* be on this list. **Bob Menendez\\* (D)** is really really unlikable. And even with a Big-Pharma CEO like **Bob Hugin (R) of Celgene,** it's enough to make people indecisive. All recent polling shows Menendez with single-digit leads over the republican challenger, some as low as **+2.** The environment here still benefits a democrat, but with the contention of this Senate race, one can only imagine how this might impact those House races held by republicans there. A little-known Democrat took nearly **30% of the vote** in the primary against Menendez, and barely spent anything. Republicans definitely have a reason to be energized in the Garden State, and we can just tack it on to the growing list of problems for democrats this Senate cycle that could have been avoided.\n3. **North Dakota** \\- Every Senate cycle, there's always a race that people peg from the beginning as flipping. In the **2014 Red Wave,** it was **Louisiana.** In 2016, it was **Illinois** (for the democrats). North Dakota is that race this year. There wasn't much question that this was going to be the most contentious race, but I think people on both sides are more or less just accepting the fact that **Kevin Cramer (R-ND-AL)** is slightly more favourited than **Heidi Heitkamp\\* (D).** Some are even saying that the dems should just leave their soldier behind in this state, in that's it worth it to direct funds and attention to other races like **Nevada, Arizona, Missouri, Florida, and even Texas.

Currently, Lewis is down in the polls, and with typical midterm turnout, we WILL lose this seat unless you bitches get off your asses and vote for him.\n\n**Minnesota 3rd:**\n\n[Erik Paulsen](https:\/\/twitter.com\/RepErikPaulsen) is the sitting republican congressman. Honestly, he is a bit of a RINO cuck and I can't honestly endorse him, but his voting record is 100% in line with the party, so I'll take him over his opponent, who wants to \"reinstate the assault weapons ban\" and supports the ACA. Dems expect to win this seat in November, so we are playing hard defense on this one.\n\n**Minnesota 7th:**\n\nCollin Peterson is the incumbent Democrat in this seat. His challenger, [Dave Hughes](https:\/\/www.hughesforcongress.us\/), has been endorsed by Trump and is neck-and-neck in the polls. This is a seat we have a chance of flipping. AKA: **RED WAVE**\n\n**Minnesota 8th:**\n\nThis seat is currently held by retiring democrat congressman Rick Nolan. The republican candidate is [Pete Stauber](https:\/\/twitter.com\/PeteStauber) and he is in dead heat against his democrat opponent. This is another Trump-endorsed candidate and an opportunity for a **YUGE RED WAVE** moment for us. Seriously, if you live in the 8th District and you're not *doing your part*, you are letting down your country and your president.\n\n\nMinnesota was so close to turning red for Trump in 2016. This is your chance to redeem yourselves. Flip these two seats and defend the other two. Donald Trump is counting on you.","subreddit":"The_Donald","title":"CALLING ALL MINNESOTA PEDES!

Finally, the suit blames the school  district for inaction to stop the bullying even after the girls recanted  their accusations.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Believe All Women?

I'm currently in college and I have a few friends that I really treasure and care about, but are very liberal and vehemontly oppose Kavanaugh.  I hate that I can't voice my opinions without them feeling like their experiences are invalidated.  This issue has been so politicized that if you don't believe Ford, you don't believe any survivors.  \n\nOf course I would believe any of my friends if they confided in me about a sexual assault, they're my friends and I trust them.  But when a very liberal college professor from California's 35+ year-old accusations are suddenly brought to light at the 11th hour by one of the most prominent Senate democrats to stop a judge that might tip the balance of the court from being confirmed, I feel that it's reasonable to be suspicious of that.  No one else has corroborated ANY of her testimonies, and the FBI probe came back negative.   \n\nAdditionally, I don't know Ford.  I have no idea what kind of person she is or how she's behaved in the past.  She's just someone who appeared from no where with a very convenient accusation. \n\nIt's just frustrating that if I voice support for Kavanaugh, I suddenly support rapists.  ***OF COURSE*** sexual assault is horrible, and ***OF COURSE*** I do not support rapists.  Quite the opposite, in fact. I don't have to believe everyone who comes forward with accusations to know these things, or to support friends that I trust.  \n\n-A frustrated college student.\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Frustration around Kavanugh"}

Plus I'm 17 and surprisingly escaped the Marxist garbage that I'm surrounded with. While I do enjoy the balanced weather, the political climate on the other hand...not so much. The teachers tend to interject their personal political beliefs into their lessons (one of my teachers just yesterday mentioned that CNN was a reputable source while Fox for some reason wasn't). \n\nThis girl wore a shirt to my Econ class that said \"I believe Anita and I believe Christine too\", and there's some shithead (not sure if cursing's allowed on this subreddit) that said \"to each according to their ability, to each according to their needs\" in that same class to create a government system, and I shouted KARL MARX and he looked like he wanted to shut me up because that's one of his best known quotes. \n\nDespite morons like these (and several others I could probably mention but would amount to being too long), there's hope. I hate identity politics so I'm going to sound like a hypocrite here but I'll tell you anyway, I know a Mexican guy that's a grade below me that wore a Trump hat to school and everyone looked so intimidated by it it was hilarious. A good friend of mine who happens to be black is a Trump supporter and was telling me that he thought the left were the real racists and how he was uncomfortable in one of his classes because he was surrounded by feminazis calling Kavanaugh a rapist the other day. Another friend of mine told me that a girl dumped him for simply following President Trump on Instagram. Also, someone in my Econ class wore a PROUD BOYS shirt to school, and also wore a shirt another time that said \"Donald J. Pump: Make America Swoll Again\".  and those leftists faces melted when they saw it. \n\nBut anyway, the point is, that WE EXIST. As few of us as there are, we're out here. I know a fair amount of other people that think the same way, just aren't open about it because as I titled this post; the left is INSANE and want to silence those who disagree with their narrative (like what they did with Alex Jones). My point being is that if conservatism\/libertarianism can reach the Bay Area, they can reach anywhere. Despite their efforts to strike us down, they only realize it makes us stronger. I'm predicting Kavanaugh will be confirmed as the Demorats have come up with ZERO evidence for their claims and I strongly hope there's a RED WAVE this November to stop this uptight, censorious, open borders, socialist\/communist, anti-1st Amendment, anti-2nd Amendment, anti-6th Amendment, anti-American platform from destroying this country. \n\nThank you for reading, I plan on potentially leaving this state for Arizona or possibly Colorado (if it's not like a mini-California with it's high gas prices and that it was a blue state last election) very soon.

{"author":"_closetconservative_","created_utc":1538787463,"num_comments":221,"score":1055,"selftext":"When I moved to San Francisco a while ago, I was not much into politics. However, I still sided with liberal policies since all of my friends, the media, social media, and late night shows were left leaning. Makes sense right? Why would anyone want to vote for stupid old republicans that are anti-science, believe in God, and hate the poor?\n\nI was in Berkeley years ago when Ben Shapiro was speaking. I remember vaguely hearing about protests for Milo, but seeing the chaos that ensued when Shapiro came caused me to watch his videos to see what all the fuss was about. After watching, I realized Ben was right about many things and was also a genuinely good person. Definitely not someone worth burning buildings over.\n\nI still didn't get that much into politics and started working at a tech company in SF. I had previously done a startup but was taking some time off being a regular employee before my next venture. On the first day, I met the diversity and inclusion lead of the company, a person who would eventually become someone I would get into quite a few verbal battles with.\n\nWhen James Damore was fired, there was outrage at my company. There were company messages broadcast from the top and many leaders expressing their outrage over his idiocy. Not a single dissenter. Similar to Shapiro, I read all of Damore's paper and found myself coming away thinking he was a reasonable person with a great point. I kept my views silent though for the fear of causing a stir with the overwhelming vocal leftist ideologues there. The ones that would want me fired just how Damore was.\n\nI eventually started opening myself up more to conservative thought, and I continued to clash with members of the diversity and inclusion group. Public messages talking about the gender wage gap, people calling for initiatives for minorities to be fast tracked to higher positions for no other reason than their gender \/ race, and managers listing the quotas of the races and genders they had been interviewing.\n\nI eventually could not hold my contempt in working in such a racist and sexist environment that didn't value the individual on their own merit. I come from a typical rural area in a single parent household and have worked my ass off to get where I am. I worked 2 crummy jobs at the same time all through college and did internships every summer after to completely fund my PhD work. None of that matters though because I am a privileged white male.\n\nThankfully I stepped down a while ago to do another startup in an area I deeply care about. When I stepped down, I kept an open mind about how I could build an inclusive and diverse workplace. A manager at the company told me to \"hire a black person as your first employee\" as some advice, and they were completely serious. That was my last straw.\n\nThe number of insane leftists in SF is astounding. All of their ideological thought is centered around who is more oppressed and how government can come in to fix it. The amount of virtue signaling and people that don't actually do anything charitable or worthwhile for society is sad. The amount of people here that don't eat animals because of moral reasons but are fine with killing completely viable babies is repulsive. And I, a white man, am the root of most of this evil. Once I'm a rich white man, I will be the epicenter of this evil.\n\nI spend my days walking around trash, human feces, needles, and vagrants that are coddled by the city and never policed. And I spend an amount on rent that would afford me a gigantic house in any other normal location. All because of decades of liberal policies.\n\nThe only thing that keeps me in SF is the large amount of money and capital here that helps me do my startup. We have a small amount of employees so far, all but one that are extremely left leaning. I mince my words every day when they demonize white people or when they weigh in on current events. And I try to keep my political opinions to myself because I know just how triggered and uncomfortable that would make my employees.\n\nI will crack one day and I will go public though, at the risk of investors not funding us, at the risk of losing my job prospects, and at the risk of being outcast from a startup that I care deeply about. It saddens me to say that coming out as a conservative in San Francisco is controversial and life changing.\n\nUntil then, I wanted my fellow Americans in this thread to know I will be going to the voting booths for the first time in my life these midterms. I will be voting for the best conservative candidates I can find. The people you can thank most for this are the radical leftists, their identity politics, and their constant obsession with being victims of society and taking no personal responsibility for where they are in life. These people want to destroy the very fundamental rights of ours. They want you to not be able to defend yourself. They make evil euphemisms about \"women's rights\" when it comes to killing completely viable babies. They want you to be guilty until proven innocent. And they want to silence your speech.\n\nI'm sorry to disappoint you all that I'm not ready to come out as a conservative in San Francisco yet. It will take some more time, planning, and courage on my part. But I wanted to let you all know that you have a friend out here. I will continue to try to have rational discourse with people out here as I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone! Wanted to clarify some things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, I do sincerely believe that many euphemisms are used to cloud the fact that completely viable human beings are killed by abortion. I am not religious and I don\u2019t believe you have to be religious to take this stance. The large majority of abortions are by healthy women with healthy babies. I was born from an accidental pregnancy, and I am grateful everyday that I was not killed in the womb because of my life being incredibly inconvenient for my mom (which holy cow was it ever). I realize that\u2019s not always the case for abortion and that it\u2019s more nuanced than that, and I\u2019m happy to respond to any objections in the comments. I do, however, believe one of the greatest evils in our society is dehumanizing others so that they can be killed, and I think that is often done in arguments about abortion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond, I wanted to let it be known that I don\u2019t hate liberals \/ leftists, and I would never advocate for violence or bullying against them. Someone pointed out in the comments about me needing to understand the difference about liberals \/ leftists. According to Ben Shapiro\u2019s definitions ([https:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-does-Ben-Shapiro-mean-when-he-compares-leftists-liberals-and-progressives](https:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-does-Ben-Shapiro-mean-when-he-compares-leftists-liberals-and-progressives)), I certainly feel most agitated about leftists and direct my anger and frustration towards them. Thanks for pointing that out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThird, while I appreciate you all messaging me to know more about the companies I\u2019ve done over the decades, I simply can\u2019t risk it at the moment. I deleted all of my social media a while ago after some social justice warriors started launching campaigns on people I know to leave horrible reviews on their company pages and take their views out of context. Like many Silicon Valley companies, we are not yet profitable and dependent on investor money and relationships. I don't mean to be distrusting of everyone messaging me, and I appreciate your support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFourth, thanks for the gold!","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I'm a closet conservative tech leader in San Francisco"}

However, I still sided with liberal policies since all of my friends, the media, social media, and late night shows were left leaning. Makes sense right? Why would anyone want to vote for stupid old republicans that are anti-science, believe in God, and hate the poor?\n\nI was in Berkeley years ago when Ben Shapiro was speaking. I remember vaguely hearing about protests for Milo, but seeing the chaos that ensued when Shapiro came caused me to watch his videos to see what all the fuss was about. After watching, I realized Ben was right about many things and was also a genuinely good person. Definitely not someone worth burning buildings over.\n\nI still didn't get that much into politics and started working at a tech company in SF. I had previously done a startup but was taking some time off being a regular employee before my next venture. On the first day, I met the diversity and inclusion lead of the company, a person who would eventually become someone I would get into quite a few verbal battles with.\n\nWhen James Damore was fired, there was outrage at my company. There were company messages broadcast from the top and many leaders expressing their outrage over his idiocy. Not a single dissenter. Similar to Shapiro, I read all of Damore's paper and found myself coming away thinking he was a reasonable person with a great point. I kept my views silent though for the fear of causing a stir with the overwhelming vocal leftist ideologues there. The ones that would want me fired just how Damore was.\n\nI eventually started opening myself up more to conservative thought, and I continued to clash with members of the diversity and inclusion group. Public messages talking about the gender wage gap, people calling for initiatives for minorities to be fast tracked to higher positions for no other reason than their gender \/ race, and managers listing the quotas of the races and genders they had been interviewing.\n\nI eventually could not hold my contempt in working in such a racist and sexist environment that didn't value the individual on their own merit. I come from a typical rural area in a single parent household and have worked my ass off to get where I am. I worked 2 crummy jobs at the same time all through college and did internships every summer after to completely fund my PhD work. None of that matters though because I am a privileged white male.\n\nThankfully I stepped down a while ago to do another startup in an area I deeply care about. When I stepped down, I kept an open mind about how I could build an inclusive and diverse workplace. A manager at the company told me to \"hire a black person as your first employee\" as some advice, and they were completely serious. That was my last straw.\n\nThe number of insane leftists in SF is astounding. All of their ideological thought is centered around who is more oppressed and how government can come in to fix it. The amount of virtue signaling and people that don't actually do anything charitable or worthwhile for society is sad. The amount of people here that don't eat animals because of moral reasons but are fine with killing completely viable babies is repulsive. And I, a white man, am the root of most of this evil. Once I'm a rich white man, I will be the epicenter of this evil.\n\nI spend my days walking around trash, human feces, needles, and vagrants that are coddled by the city and never policed. And I spend an amount on rent that would afford me a gigantic house in any other normal location. All because of decades of liberal policies.\n\nThe only thing that keeps me in SF is the large amount of money and capital here that helps me do my startup. We have a small amount of employees so far, all but one that are extremely left leaning. I mince my words every day when they demonize white people or when they weigh in on current events. And I try to keep my political opinions to myself because I know just how triggered and uncomfortable that would make my employees.\n\nI will crack one day and I will go public though, at the risk of investors not funding us, at the risk of losing my job prospects, and at the risk of being outcast from a startup that I care deeply about. It saddens me to say that coming out as a conservative in San Francisco is controversial and life changing.\n\nUntil then, I wanted my fellow Americans in this thread to know I will be going to the voting booths for the first time in my life these midterms. I will be voting for the best conservative candidates I can find. The people you can thank most for this are the radical leftists, their identity politics, and their constant obsession with being victims of society and taking no personal responsibility for where they are in life. These people want to destroy the very fundamental rights of ours. They want you to not be able to defend yourself. They make evil euphemisms about \"women's rights\" when it comes to killing completely viable babies. They want you to be guilty until proven innocent. And they want to silence your speech.\n\nI'm sorry to disappoint you all that I'm not ready to come out as a conservative in San Francisco yet. It will take some more time, planning, and courage on my part. But I wanted to let you all know that you have a friend out here. I will continue to try to have rational discourse with people out here as I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone! Wanted to clarify some things.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFirst, I do sincerely believe that many euphemisms are used to cloud the fact that completely viable human beings are killed by abortion. I am not religious and I don\u2019t believe you have to be religious to take this stance. The large majority of abortions are by healthy women with healthy babies. I was born from an accidental pregnancy, and I am grateful everyday that I was not killed in the womb because of my life being incredibly inconvenient for my mom (which holy cow was it ever). I realize that\u2019s not always the case for abortion and that it\u2019s more nuanced than that, and I\u2019m happy to respond to any objections in the comments. I do, however, believe one of the greatest evils in our society is dehumanizing others so that they can be killed, and I think that is often done in arguments about abortion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSecond, I wanted to let it be known that I don\u2019t hate liberals \/ leftists, and I would never advocate for violence or bullying against them. Someone pointed out in the comments about me needing to understand the difference about liberals \/ leftists. According to Ben Shapiro\u2019s definitions ([https:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-does-Ben-Shapiro-mean-when-he-compares-leftists-liberals-and-progressives](https:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-does-Ben-Shapiro-mean-when-he-compares-leftists-liberals-and-progressives)), I certainly feel most agitated about leftists and direct my anger and frustration towards them. Thanks for pointing that out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThird, while I appreciate you all messaging me to know more about the companies I\u2019ve done over the decades, I simply can\u2019t risk it at the moment. I deleted all of my social media a while ago after some social justice warriors started launching campaigns on people I know to leave horrible reviews on their company pages and take their views out of context. Like many Silicon Valley companies, we are not yet profitable and dependent on investor money and relationships. I don't mean to be distrusting of everyone messaging me, and I appreciate your support.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFourth, thanks for the gold!","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I'm a closet conservative tech leader in San Francisco""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"AgainstHateSubreddits","title":"r\/Conservative \"closeted conservative tech leader\" bemoans homeless people not being \"policed\", minorities not respecting him for being so very bootstrappy."}

All you\u2019ve accomplished is looking like heros to the people who will vote D their entire life anyways. \n\nAny sane, rational person will reject this lunacy and join the only party with morals left. The silent majority is coming. I welcome anyone with a rational mind that can have civil debate to the new Republican Party. To the rest on the left, I\u2019m done trying to explain facts over feelings. I\u2019ll see you in November and I don\u2019t expect you\u2019ll like the results.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Dear Liberals}

They were like \"oh we have strong evidence that Kav got drunk and made crude remarks to his friends.\"  Meanwhile Ford is some always honest highly respected angel. So the \"logical conclusion\" is to believe Ford and think that Kav is lying.\n\nWell there's a reason for that. Brett's past was open season. They got all sorts of character assassins saying nonsense like \"I was his roommate at one point and he was an asshole\" or \"I was his drinking buddy and he was pretty irresponsible while he was drunk.\" We know a ton about his past now, and we know he wasn't perfect because no one is. And look you will never be able to convince me that \"Renate Alumni\" was a term of endearment. Everyone knows how boys at an all boys catholic school are.\n\nHowever in Ford's case. Her past is off limits. No one can dare mention the fact that she cheated one at least one of her ex boyfriends. Or draw attention to the fact that she was sneaking out to go to these parties at age 15 without her parents permission. No one is allowed to ask her former roommates if she was known as an honest person. Or if she ever made up stories that weren't true for attention. No one is even allowed to accuse her of lying, they need to diplomatically imply (but not directly say) that she's mistaken. The moment someone says they're a survivor, in this current climate, their past is off limits, especially their past relationships. Their reputation is off limits. In fact you can barely even cross examine them (because it might be triggering!)\n\nSo then is it any wonder, that the survivor comes off as a more reputable person than the one they're accusing?\n\nBut the immunities they already have aren't enough. Now the far left is holding up signs that say \"we believe all survivors!\" I guess that's the logical next step. We've already established that a survivor is a Good Person (TM) with a character that's beyond reproach. It only follows from that that someone such as Ford is incapable of lying.\n\nI am so glad that Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to the supreme court.

I can see now how the MSM are full of one sided crap and an echo chamber, in which we were constantly repeating the leftist mantra of tolerance and freedom whilst acting the exact opposite. I used to see a conservative person as a backward gun toting hick with little to no education because that's what is being portrayed in the media and I just accepted it. \n\nThe Dems overplayed this thing, trying to destroy a pretty decent guy for political gain, and the worst thing they could find about this guy is that he drank during high school and he threw an ice cube at a bar, including a barrage of accusations without and substance or evidence. This is what got me and I believe a lot more like me. That they can fuck a man's life, one who has stellar record and a family man, that easily. That guy is a GOOD guy, and look at the damage they've done. What do you think the narrative is going to be if Kavanaugh didn't go through, that they can destroy a good man's life just because it is to their benefit.

To cut right to it, I am a political psychology researcher, and I try and study the political divide between the left and right, and analyze partisan bias.\n\nAlthough I am surely what this sub would term a \"fellow conservative\" (since I subscribe to this sub while being left-leaning), I am principled in my belief that exposure to a healthy balance of views regarding social, economic, and political matters is the best way to stave off partisan prejudice becoming an all-consuming force in one's life.\n\nThe point of my post today is simply gaining perspective from the conservatives who congregate here in this sub. I have questions that I would love to hear opinions on, and will try and answer posts as they come in, as appropriate. Mods, feel free to let me know if I have broken any rules with this post, last thing I want to do is clutter the feed. I hope this post is seen as the good-faith posting it is, and not as some attempt at \"trolling\".\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this far, and I hope you all have a good day\/evening.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. What are topics that you believe individuals on the left actively do not understand, or struggle to understand? That is to say, topics that those on the left do not interpret positions on the right correctly, not just the Left disagreeing with the right. For those topics, what is the misunderstanding and how do you justify your position?\n\n2. For any #WalkAway subscribers, how do you evaluate political candidates? Do you focus solely on Republican candidates and find your best fit on the right? Do you vote based upon the positions on specific policies, or do you vote holistically (that is, you evaluate the candidate overall)?\n\n3. There is a large discrepancy between liberal and conservative interpretations of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding his demeanor. As conservatives, what behaviors would a judicial nominee display that would make you wary of pledging support for him\/her?","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"A \"fellow conservative\" seeking perspective"}

{"author":"NHArts","created_utc":1538937633,"num_comments":5,"score":17,"selftext":"I've been watching many videos for the past several days about kav, ford, and swetnick and also read some web page articles about them. Here are some things that I've learned about ford:\n\n* her high school was full of drunken, promiscuous sluts who liked to drink until blacking out. This is from her high school yearbook pages. Look them up. These pages were scrubbed from the internet recently to protect Ford from looking bad, but someone re-uploaded them.\n* Ford's entire social media presence &amp; records have been scrubbed\/erased from the internet. I assume she didn't want us to know what kind of person she really is.\n* Ford was one of the high school sluts and her nickname was \"ballsey,\" a play on her middle name.\n* Ford lied &amp; perjured herself when she said she had a 2nd door because she was claustrophobic because of the sex attack. The 2nd door was there for business reasons. Part of her house was used for business &amp; rental. Her ex boyfriend said she's not claustrophobic at all.\n* Ford lied &amp; perjured herself when she said that she never gave anyone tips on taking a polygraph test. Her ex boyfriend said she coached her friend on polygraph tests to help her get a government job.\n* Ford lied when she said she didn't want to fly to Washington because she's scared of flying. She actually has flown many times for vacations and work reasons.\n* She had never mentioned Kavanaugh by name to her therapist and she refuses to release her therapist notes. She also originally said that 4 men had sexually attacked her, then she changed the story to 2 men.\n* She claims to have forgotten every major and basic piece of info about the sexual attack's location, time, how she got home, who took her home, who drove her to the party, and so on, but there's many other women who've been sexually attacked who say that they remember everything about it and the circumstances and even how things smelled. Ford claims she can't remember any info that could possibly be investigated for the sake of corroboration of her accusation, except for some names of the people at the party, and all those people deny having been at the party or say they can't remember such a party.\n* Ford's ex boyfriend said that after he found out she cheated on him, she used his credit card and spent a lot of money with it. She refused to pay him back until he threatened to press charges.\n* The prosecutor who questioned her at the senate judiciary meeting wrote a report that said that Ford's case is very weak, even weaker than a normal \"he said she said\" case, and that this case would be too weak to go to a trial. And she said there were many inconsistencies in Ford's testimony.\n* Ford made many donations to a leftist political organization\n* Ford marched in the washington women's march, which was an anti-trump march, where women wore pink pussy hats made of knitted yarn.\n* Ford had made multiple pink pussy hats, except her version was made to look like a brain. (ha! she looks like an idiot to me)\n* Ford has been teaching a class for CIA students. In addition her grandfather was in the CIA or something like that. So it looks like she's probably some kind of CIA asset.\n* Ford has received over $500,000 in a gofundme account, which she testified that she didn't know much about. She may have another gofundme account besides that.\n* Ford's parents were in a home foreclosure case, and the judge who ruled against them was Brett Kavanaugh's mother.\n* Ford has stated that all judges who are like Scalia should be banned from the entire US legal system. Scalia was highly respected and was a constitutional originalist or something like that. So she wants judges banned simply because they support the constitution. By the way, the US family court system does not follow the constitution and it's a really horrible, nightmarish court system that horribly persecutes men and ruins their lives and enslaves them to women. Kavanaugh is claimed to be similar to Scalia. Podesta's email messages which Seth Rich had copied from a DNC server showed that Podesta received an email talking about judge Scalia having been murdered. Seth Rich was also murdered shortly after copying emails from the DNC server and giving it to Wikileaks.\n* Ford's entire family has failed to say anything in support of her to vouch for her character or her story or anything. They have been silent. Why? Because they know she's a horrible person?\n* Ford lied in claiming that she's a licensed psychologist, which is illegal. She does have degrees in psychology, but she was never a licensed psychologist.\n* Leland Keyser,\u00a0a friend of Christine Blasey Ford who Ford\u00a0[claimed was at the party](https:\/\/thepoliticalinsider.com\/christine-ford-kavanaugh-witnesses\/)  where she was allegedly sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh, has not  only refuted the accuser\u2019s version of the story, but told FBI  investigators that Ford\u2019s \u201callies\u201d tried to pressure her to change the  original version. \u201cSimply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no  recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present,  with, or without, Dr. Ford,\u201d her lawyer stated under penalty of felony.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"What's Known about Christine Blasey Ford"}

I\u2019m from Boston, raised Dem, and am a son of Hispanic and Irish immigrants.  They\u2019re hardline identity politics in their support. \u201cBlue or screw\u201d is what I grew up hearing. I never quite agreed or felt a part of that message.  \n\nAfter a successful run as a finance manager I decided to join the navy as a nuclear operations engineer, as an attempt to serve my country, and see more of the world. I loved it and quickly began to realize that there was more to the closed minded ideology of the left in which is was forced to cultivate my upbringing. Now, after retiring from the navy (early do to an overseas accident) I am an engineer in the NOVA\/WV area.  I\u2019ve learned that the sentiment is much more regional and cultural, mainly focusing in on cities, where the echo chamber constitutes a perpetual loop of multiplicity in leftist ideals.  \n\nRoughly a year ago I began listening to podcasts. First for powerlifting and fitness and then slowly but surely I began drifting to right wing conservative podcasts like Shapiro\u2019s and Crowder\u2019s. I felt hope again. I realized that I was simply not aware that other people had the same feelings and thoughts I did with regard to some of the topics I viewed handled with injustice. Labeling straight white males and bad, or wrong, or inherently privileged for their whiteness was something I ardently disagreed with but heard often.  I thought of my father, son of an Irish immigrant who worked construction his whole life and struggled to support a family of five.  Where was his privilege? My mother, too proud to accept government assistance (through she and my father blindly supported the introduction of it and other dem policies) worked two jobs to help pay the bills my father struggled with.  Why didn\u2019t our white privileged help? Additionally, cops are bad, minorities deserve special treatment because of their upbringing (even though my mother never got any being from Costa Rica), were all topics I disagreed with but was constantly force fed through apathetic fervency to be correct and just. \n\n My point to all this is that I am thankful I found this sub and the conservative culture as a whole because I was beginning to feel isolated!  Not in a depressing, \u201cim gonna lose my mind way\u201d but more in a \u201ccome on, NO ONE really believes that BS\u201d kind of way.

That in addition to conversations with some family and the recent insanity with Kavanaugh has convinced me I need to be more aware of the political sphere.\n\nWhat I would like to know from you guys is this: If you support Trump, what exactly is it about him that you like?

After the whole Kavanaugh circus, I really cannot see myself voting Democrat ever again, for reasons stated tenfold on this sub. During the whole fiasco the ACLU really showed their true colors and are no longer interested in extending and protecting the constitutional rights to all Americans. Here's my cancellation email:\n\n&gt;Hello,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I've been a monthly donator to the ACLU for the last 2 years and I wish to cancel my automatic monthly donation. A couple of the main selling points of the person who signed me up was that the ACLU was a bipartisan organization that sought to extend the protections of the constitution to all people of this country. I remember being told that transgendered people could be fired simply for being transgender, with gender identity not being a protected class in many states. For these reasons I felt that the contribution was a small thing I could do to make the country a better place. I feel and still feel that protections of our constitution should be extended to all peoples of our country, no matter the color or creed.\u00a0  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, due to the recent actions surrounding Justice Kavanaugh and the ACLU's email pressers in response, it seems to me that the organization has diverted from protecting the liberties enshrined in our bill of rights for all people, namely the right to due process and presumption of innocence, to adopting a more partisan take on the issues, throwing out the rights the organization claims to protect to score political points. This is where I draw the line, and I no longer feel my contribution is going to an organization that wishes to make this country a better place for all people.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;HornyVan\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo get a taste of what finally broke the camel's back, here's ACLU's summary of the Brett Kavanaugh ordeal: [https:\/\/www.aclu.org\/blog\/executive-branch\/why-aclu-opposes-brett-kavanaughs-nomination-supreme-court](https:\/\/www.aclu.org\/blog\/executive-branch\/why-aclu-opposes-brett-kavanaughs-nomination-supreme-court)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\u201cThe ACLU opposes the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. There are credible allegations that Judge Kavanaugh has engaged in serious misconduct that have not been adequately investigated by the Senate. Dr. Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s credible testimony, subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct, the inadequate investigation, and Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s testimony at the hearing lead us to doubt Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s fitness to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cThis is not a decision taken lightly. We cannot remain silent under these extraordinary circumstances about a lifetime appointment to the highest court of the land. The standard for such an appointment should be high, and the burden is on the nominee. That burden is not met as long as there are unresolved questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assault.\u201d\u00a0\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, now that I have an extra $20\/month in my pocket, what are some organizations I can donate to that actually protect the constitutional rights of Americans?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: can't spell ACLU\n\n&amp;#x200B;","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Voted for Clinton in 2016.

It's been a long time, I haven't really watched him since the election. So, this my first time seeing him in an extended format closing in on two crazy years later. \n\nWhat struck me the most was how light-hearted he was. You really get a sense that he loves doing the rallies. But it was specifically the shit-talking that seemed so light-hearted in comparison to what's coming out from the left. At one point he flexed his arm like he was on WWE. He was making fun of an opponent, I forget who, someone claimed he was in a battle in Vietnam, so Trump pantomimed running up the hill and dodging bullets left and right. \n\nIt's like he's talking to a child, but you know in the fun way. Telling simple stories. Clipping each idea off with a repetition. with a repetition, folks. \n\nInsane how this image has put the left in its position of hatred. To think! .. My theory had been the left's fatal error was focusing on propagandizing against Trump, closing off their echochambers, blinding themselves to the right's critique. How exaggerated that spiral has been, exaggerated by network effects.\n\nThe man is actually quite brilliant in a way. I found myself _wanting_ to think that, and in doing so, you find yourself _wanting_ to believe the country could be great, that everything could be awesome. \n\nAnd you can't really blame him, because he stumbled right into it. He didn't architect the left's collapse. The left is corrupted to the bone. It's visible. It needs a reset. And the idea of Donald Trump makes me believe the system can see a corrupted stack, and the natural pressure chooses someone like him. Everything naturally falls into place. We can trust ourselves. \n\nMaybe it's true, you know, that the future is filled with possibility.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Hey I'm on the left, and I watched a Trump rally last night."}

{"author":"0ttervonBismarck","created_utc":1539185873,"num_comments":0,"score":3,"selftext":"Midterms are all about turnout. I'm sure you've heard this before, and its true. Midterm elections always have lower turnout than Presidential elections, with only the more motivated voters showing up to the polls. Thus, whoever can get their supporters more motivated to show up will likely win, as less engaged, undecided voters are unlikely to even show up to vote.\n\nWhat does this actually mean in practical terms though? Well, it means that even if you live in a deep blue state, you can make a huge difference.\n\nTake California for example. It has only been getting bluer, and Trump did not reverse that trend. Trump was in fact deeply unpopular in California even among Republicans and Republican leaning voters. His 4.5 million votes from the state was worse than Romney did. However, its more than the 4.2 million votes the Democrats got in the 2014 midterms. What that means is that if every Trump voter showed up in 2018, the GOP could come close to the Democrats in vote totals, and actually pick up seats.\n\nSo even if you live in a blue state in a blue district, the reason why, is because you and a bunch of other Republicans showed up 2 years ago and are planning on sitting this one out. So don't. \n\nIts unfathomable to me that some people \"don't vote in midterms\" I've seen comments like that numerous times on this sub and I cant make any sense of it. I've only cast a ballot in 4 elections here in Canada, and only 2 of them could be described as enthusiastically. So even if you aren't thrilled with your local candidate and you dont think they'll win, show up anyway. Your vote is a signal to other conservatives sitting at home that they aren't alone, and that together you can make a difference.\n\nGet out there and stop the Democrats.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"It's all about turnout."}

{"author":"TalbotFarwell","created_utc":1539225606,"num_comments":13,"score":21,"selftext":"This applies equally to those stuck in California\/liberal areas of Oregon and Washington, but it's mostly focused on those of us here on the East Coast, namely the Mid-Atlantic and New England. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm a lifelong Marylander. I love my state for our diverse terrain, our proud history of being close to the heart of the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the Civil War; our world-famous Chesapeake Bay blue crabs and all the delicious meals you can make with them, and having ice-cold Natty Boh to wash it down; summer vacations down in Ocean City, driving across the Bay Bridge, visiting Sandy Point State Park, the Catoctin Mountains and Cunningham Falls, Deep Creek Lake; exploring Frederick's history of German-American settlement, Baltimore's row-homes and all of the Victorian and Edwardian-era buildings downtown, admiring Hagerstown's blue-collar spirit (Trump had a max-capacity rally there!); being the home to Johns Hopkins and the Naval Academy and Fort Detrick and Joint Base Andrews and a bunch of huge employers in the defense industry; being home to both the Redskins *and* the Ravens, and in baseball we have the Orioles, and for the other major sports we're rooting for the nearby Caps, the Wizards, DC United, etc... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just hate being constantly outnumbered by **hordes upon hordes** of liberals, in the latest polls for the 2018 midterms, incumbent Senator Ben Cardin (D) has his Republican challenger (Tony Campbell) solidly beat by drawing 59% of the vote to Campbell's 19% if I recall correctly. I'm from rural Frederick County, so growing up I was among a solidly conservative constituency in a tight-knit community. But going to Frederick Community College and eventually getting a great-paying job in neighboring Montgomery County, I feel like I'm more alienated from society by seeing hundreds of thousands of people blindly embrace liberalism so readily. It's not even an ethic thing, I see more snobby white liberal yuppies than anything, with their \"RESIST\" stickers and their Clinton stickers on their car from the 2016 election. People around here are so quick to accept open-borders advocacy, pro-abortion and pro-LGBT stances, anti-2nd Amendment legislation, and they will jump down your throat with hatred if you question the \"Trump\/Russia collusion\" narrative. For me, voting for Trump and seeing him get elected was a dream come true... but Maryland still turned out for Clinton, 60.5% to 35.3%. I sure as hell did my part, I spread the word on social media. I waved signs outside polling places on primary day, I voted early in both the primary and the general elections. I even got cussed-out and had my car vandalized by random strangers. (Nobody tried punching me though, I'm like 6'2\" and 220. I'm a pretty physically imposing dude in-person.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it because more of them are Federal agency pencil-pushers, and therefore feel bound to vote for Democrats who're going to \"refill the swamp\" rather than drain it? Or is it the fact that lucrative Federal contracts draw legions of corporate white-collar yuppies... but if that's the case, why is Montgomery County and nearby Northern Virginia so damn left-lib\/progressive leaning? You'd think moving up the ladder of social mobility would turn them more right-leaning, right? It's a big enough problem that I've been voting my whole adult life (since the 2010 midterms) and I can't recall ever having helped contribute to making a single damn dent in the Democrats' monolithic foothold here in MD. The only reason we got Larry Hogan elected governor is because he's a massive RINO who gives the Democrats ground on basically anything (gun control, immigration enforcement) despite claiming to be a \"bipartisan moderate\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know quite a few conservatives who have registered as Democrat; to either shift the tide of the Democratic Party back to \"blue dog\" Democrats like Jim Webb (who I honestly like, and wanted to see as Trump's running mate in 2016), or at the very least to vote for the more extreme Democrats during the primaries to throw a wrench into the gears. But to me that doesn't feel right, I like being able to vote Republican (we have a closed-primary system) in the primaries and actually have a say in our party's candidates. Either way, we always get creamed during the general election. At this rate, I'm strongly considering jumping ship when my wife and I can afford a home outside the state, possibly in nearby Pennsylvania or West Virginia. Somewhere away from the liberal lunacy of the D.C. suburbs and the Annapolis elites... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just hate the idea of \"cutting and running\" from my home state, does anyone else struggle with the same decision? (Plus it would make my nearly hour-long commute an hour-and-a-half or two hours!) Especially those of you reading this from New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, California, Washington, Oregon, etc. I know a lot of conservative New Jersey-ites are moving to PA, and a lot of conservative Californians are escaping to Nevada and Arizona. I also want to live in a state where my vote actually matters, and actually helps get pro-Trump, pro-MAGA Republicans elected. Part of why I hate living in Maryland is because I feel like my vote is like basically like trying to absorb the Atlantic Ocean with a kitchen sponge. But at the same time... home is home, and Maryland will always be \"home\" to me. Does anyone else struggle with this? Plus, with all the hostility in today's political climate and battle lines being drawn, I kinda feel like if SHTF, my family and I will be in the hot zone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you all so much, I hope this doesn't come off as a rant.

On a personal level I hate the guy but when it comes to his politics and policies I think he has done a lot of great things and will certainly go down as a president to remember. I have just recently (within the last year or so) converted to a more conservative way of thinking and my political preferences have changed drastically, but many of my friends and my fianc\u00e9 are staunch liberals that despise everything conservative so I\u2019ve been closeted for a while now. Now that Trump is visiting my fianc\u00e9 and a lot of my friends are outraged at the campus and I am trying my best to hold my tongue and try to understand them but their outrage isn\u2019t really based in anything other than their hate of the right. Let me say that I love my fianc\u00e9 very much and we\u2019ve both believed that politics not be what drives a relationship but hearing her complain with these leftist points is very off putting for me and I don\u2019t want to belittle her by just dismissing everything she believes is false. Any opinions on this matter because I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one in this situation. \n\nEdit: when I say I\u2019m closeted I mean to my friends, my fianc\u00e9 is aware that I have conservative view points just not to what extent. So we have had political conversations I\u2019m just trying to show some restraint and not tell her everything she believes in is wrong and she shouldn\u2019t think that, don\u2019t want to sound like the libs.

{"author":"MyLittleGrowRoom","created_utc":1539363601,"num_comments":1,"score":2,"selftext":"Why have an electoral college and not a straight democracy? In short, a democracy isn't a fair system. A democracy doesn't protect individual rights. We are not really one people, we're, just like the name implies, a group of 50 states united under one form of government and language (sorta). The difference in the cultures of NYC and Chamblee, GA are as disparate as any two nations in other parts of the world. There's even blatantly obvious difference in the languages we use. I grew up in NYC and left for Augusta, GA when I was 17. I assure you, none of my friends in NYC ever used the words, \"y'all,\" \"fixin'\", or reckon\" once, couldn't escape it in Augusta. All these people exist under a government which exists largely because we were pissed about taxation without representation. So our founders saw fit to assure these individual colonies maintained their proportional representation in the single government they were forming. So how do you do that when the vast majority of people live in urban centers and the vast majority of the country is sparsely populated agricultural land? How does North Dakota become as well represented as California (using today's conditions for argument's sake)? By using congressional districts in our House of Representatives, and giving each of the states two seats in the Senate. Good, that's one of our ruler's rules set down that's actually fair to the various populations of the individual states. Then there's the judiciary, how do we get our top judges, who themselves shall have an equal place among the rulers of our people? Have the Chief Executive, and hold on, we're coming to him, appoint them, and have Senate act as a buffer to the process. Now we have a system where we have a proportional voice and that voice gives us veto power over who will sit and judge us. \n\nNow to that Chief Executive, isn't that what we came here for in the first place? But he doesn't stand alone. He has immense power over the direction of the country and each person deserves to have a proportional voice in selecting who that is. So how do we do that? If we did that by a direct popular vote, aka, democracy, the selection would fall into the hands of the Tri-State Area around NYC, Southern California, Dallas, and Chicago. Nebraska, Iowa, Utah, both Dakotas, etc. would have zero voice in who our president would be. Their interests, even if approved by Congress, would be easily vetoed by a president who is only answerable to a few densely populated areas. Did you notice how many times Trump stumped in Iowa, Nebraska, Ohio, Florida, etc? Because those people get to have a proportional voice over who the President will be. The way to give the individual an equal voice is to slice it into the smallest pieces we have, House districts. Each house district gets one vote and each Senator gets one vote based on the popular votes of their areas. This way each ~711,000 (according to Google) gets a single vote no matter where they live. \n\n\nTL;DR And this is why we have an electoral college, to give each citizen a fair, proportional vote and not have it drowned out by small regions with a dense population and a shared culture. \n\nKAG! Vote in the mid-terms.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"To anyone who doesn't get why we have an electoral college, and why it's essential to our nation."}

It has made errors, and it is absolutely conservative in the mainstream conservative manner that can be found in American households across America.  The errors made by Breitbart needed to be pulled and corrected.\n\nThat out of the way, many of the issues within Breitbart that caused concern among the right are essentially entirely removed.  The taste for the \u201calt-right\u201d, which was and remains a tiny group with a negligible number of adherents, has almost entirely be pulled.  Troubling people like Milo Yiannopoulos and Steve Bannon have left the website and have no presence there anymore.  I will not lie, for well over a year, I had determined not to read, use, or post the website on this subreddit.  I considered it too troubling.\n\nHowever, those who have been too close to those sources are now gone.  I have made a point to post articles from Breitbart when I see articles I like, just like I do from Fox News, Daily Wire, PJ Media, and National Review.  At this point, the Breitbart is effectively no different, and there is no evidence that it\u2019s articles are any more \"troubling\" than those other websites.\n\nYou who are on here are under no requirement to like Breitbart, but since changes in leadership, the complaints that Breitbart is \u201cinvalid\u201d or \u201cracist\u201d will not be heard.  It has *entirely* returned to its hard-hitting and mainstream Conservative roots as imagined by its founder, the late, great, Andrew Breitbart.\n\nYou are wasting our time by complaining about it, and if you\u2019re a leftist, you\u2019ll almost certainly be banned.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"This Subreddit Authorizes Breitbart Articles"}

Plus it's Cali...\n\nCA-25:  Clinton narrowly won even though Romney won by 6.7%.   Dem is an attractive blond woman, I'd say he loses this narrowly based on the polls.\n\nCA-39:  Another similar district to 25.  Polling gives the Rep a chance here for sure, but I think it's a loss given the partisan balance and the state involved here.  Plus no incumbency advantage here, it's an open seat.\n\nCA-45:  Another similar one with a R incumbent this time.  Polling is worse, this seems more reliably a loss than the last one.\n\nIL-6:  Clinton outperformed Romney by 15% here.  Too many country club snobby RINOs who love the Koch Bros to win imho even though the Rep is +1% in the polls and he has incumbency advantage.\n\nKS-3:  Clinton narrowly won it, Romney won it easily.  Two polls show this is a loss for Reps.  If we somehow hold this the Reps will be having a very good night indeed.\n\nNC-9:  Trump\/Romney won it both by 11.6%, but the polling isn't great for the incumbent.  The two most recent polls have him at an average of 43.5%, even though one poll has him ahead by 5%.  I'd say the probabilities are narrowly against him here despite the partisan advantage, he should be polling above 45% as a known quantity.  However I'll be excited if we somehow hold this one.\n\nNJ-7:  Clinton narrowly won a Romney district.  Incumbent behind 3%, narrow loss.\n\nNV-3:  No incumbent advantage, Trump only won by 1%, Obama won by 1%.  Only poll shows Dem ahead by 2%, but the sample size is shit.  This one looks lost to me regardless though.  But it was a Dem seat to begin with, so no partisan net change if dems hold.\n\nPA-1:  Lost, narrowly won by clinton\/obama, polls are close but the more recent one is is negative.  Incumbent advantage insufficient.\n\n\n\n\n**Narrow toss-up WINS for Republicans**:\n\nCA-48:  Narrow Clinton win, big Romney win, but I'm giving this to the Reps based on incumbency advantage and the polling.\n\nFL-26:  Hispanic incumbent Rep vs white seems like he is holding this seat based on polling despite the partisan leaning of the district to D's.  If this one is lost early in the night Reps may lose house (I'm obviously uncertain we can hold this one).\n\nFL-27:  Same story as FL-26, Hispanic Rep is up by 2%.  But would not be surprised to lose this one early on election night.\n\nIA-3:  Trump outperformed Obama here by 7%, plus incumbency advantage, plus polling that isn't that bad.  Narrow hold here by a few percent.\n\nIL-12:  Trump massively outperformed Romney, this is a MAGA district with the Rep narrowly ahead in the only poll.  Plus incumbent advantage.  I just don't see this one going D.\n\nIL-14:  Decent poll with the incumbent up +4%, plus Trump\/Romney won it by 4% and 10% respectively.\n\nKS-2:  Massive MAGA district Trump won by 18%, Romney won by 14%.  It's open and the polls are close, but I just can't see them overcoming a partisan advantage of that magnitude.  Plus it's Kansas, comon.\n\nKY-6:  MAGA territory, Trump and Romney easily won by like 13-15%.  Incumbent Rep holding a narrow poll lead near 47%.  Not sure why the only polling is showing such a close race, but it's only a single poll.  If we lose this one, we're probably done for in the House.\n\nME-2:  MAGA territory, Trump outperformed Obama here by 19%.  Poll looks good for the Rep.\n\nMI-8:  Trump outperformed Romney and easily won by 6.7%.  Polls are solid enough to count this a narrow win for the Rep incumbent.\n\nNC-13:  Trump +9%, Romney +7%.  Rep incumbent is ahead in two polls by a decent margin.  Narrow hold.\n\nNJ-3:  Trump +6, Obama +5.  Partisan advantage of +11, polling is close, but not close enough to give this one to the Dems.  Plus incumbent advantage.\n\nNM-2:  Trump +10, Romney +7.  Given Trump over-performance and small Rep advantage in polling, I'd say we hold this open district.\n\nNY-19:  Partisan advantage of R 13% too strong for dems to take this despite the narrow polls.  The samples are too small imo to give them much weight.  Polls are also very old.  Incumbent narrowly wins re-election.\n\nNY-22:  Same story as last one, but slightly stronger for Reps based on partisan advantage of 16%.\n\nTX-7:  Clinton won this one narrowly, but Romney carried it by a whopping 22%.  That means the partisan advantage is 21% R.  These people are obviously cuckservatives, but they'll probably re-elect their incumbent R.  Poll is +3% for Rep at 48%.  \n\nTX-23:  Similar cuckservative story here, weak for Trump, but super strong for Romney.  R incumbent narrowly ahead in the only poll at 48%.  I have no idea what's wrong with my fellow Texans here.\n\nUT-4:  Strongest cuckservative story of the election night.  Trump +6.7, Romney +37.  Polls show Rep narrowly ahead, should be a win, but it shouldn't be this close...\n\nVA-5:  No polling data, no incumbent, but Trump outperformed Romney by a lot.  These people are MAGA.  They won't vote D imho.\n\nVA-6:  Trump won by 6.5, Romney 10.5.  Slightly cucky here, Rep incumbent with 2% lead.  I see a narrow hold here.\n\nWA-8:  This one seems to defy the trend more than any I've seen.  Narrowly won by Clinton and Obama, but the Rep incumbent is ahead by 10% in the latest poll.  Average of last two polls shows 5.5% lead.  However newer data is desperately needed.  I won't be surprised if this one is lost, but as of now I can't give to to the dems quite yet.\n\n**RESULTS:  DEMS SHORT BY 3 VOTES**","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"My detailed analysis of every toss-up US House race on Real Clear Politics shows the Republicans narrowly holding a majority"}

The value of American Citizenship has reached its peak since Ellis Island. \n\nWhat if we came up with a system in which those who committed capital crimes, Had their US citizenships revoked and were extradited ? \n\nConfused?\n\n\u201cBetween 1788 and 1868, about 162,000 convicts were transported by the British government to various penal colonies in Australia.\u201d \n\nWhat if America purchased an Island in which this is where we sent our prisoners? Once charged with a capital crime, You will be tried and convicted. Once you\u2019ve been found guilty, You would be allotted 3 appeals before transportation to the undisclosed island. If you dared try to return to the US, You would be treated as a Terrorist and National Threat to the Republic. \n\nIt would completely change the mindset of our citizens. Would you dare commit a crime, if you knew possibly, Once convicted you\u2019ll live out the rest of your days on a undisclosed island, Knowing you\u2019ll never see anyone you\u2019ve ever loved again? \n\nThe money our government has spent on Prisons is astounding. This would reduce the amount the country spends on Prisoners by Multi-Billions. If those with Capital crimes have their citizenship revoked. We can rehabilitate a huge population of Senior Prisoners as that\u2019s where most of our prison budget goes. We should enforce our constitutional right of slave labor by prisoner for the rest. Prisoners should be working their fingers to the bone, Day and night to help build  country in every way needed. Not sitting in solitary   If we used the old methods of punishing prisoners, The population would drop of those imprisonment drastically, Especially including extradition. This would change the mindset of every American and potential criminal. We are at a time where people would literally kill just to live in our beloved country. Why do we let those that kill and terrorize our citizens , to retain in this country and pay for their comfort?\n\nPs.

For many years we had watched the dismantling of our America. When Trump won the election a new hope stirred, we were wide eyed and optimistic. It seemed there might be hope after all, for the first time in decades we felt cautious optimism. For so long we've felt imprisoned by our Government, slowly sheading our freedoms and rights, more and more strangled by the system. Such dark day's passing one by one, edict's flowing from the highest seat in the land, subverting our founder's design for our Republic. As I write this reflecting on how we felt prior to Trump's victory I'm realizing the depth of despair set upon us, terrifying (my poor children), in some way this looming fear of our own Government must be how the 2.5 million colonists must have felt before armed conflict broke out. \n\nHere I sit, grasping onto faith that was instilled in my youth, once again we the people, finally have a citizen statesman leading the Republic. Inspiration is an odd feeling, having felt so helpless for so long, in some way writing this, which started as a response to one of the posting on freetalk24.com, has turned into a surge of catharsis. What follows is where my response began, the opening may seem random, at the time one of the posts spoke of an enemy, some undefinable entity that has materialized, built and become more aggressive in my lifetime. Is this what a REVELATION feels like? Writing this I realize why I've felt so vulnerable and small for so long, this concealed entity has slowly revealed a complete system, judicial, religious, political, social, economic, executive (Obama) and as its final targeted takeover military component's. Thank god our military is the last bastion of Patriotism that have battled and refused to surrender America.\n\n\"They\" were and still are in many ways very close to establishing a complete centralized state, in our case a deep state. This \"State\" within our nation is embedded within the \"Acronym Agencies\", i.e. EPA, DHHS, FCC, FAA, FDA, DOD, FBI, and so on. Not accountable or elected by we the people. With a Social Justice (socialism by any other name) agenda these supposed American's employ the power of the state against their opponents (DOD or IRS pursue you if you're not on their plantation), a Fascist authoritarian suppression of an opponent. Recent leaders have rented and sold American policy, intellectual property and state secrets, a systematic war to dismantle our Republic, of course enriching themselves in the process.\n\nAs much as our own success and blessings have allowed American apathy to flourish, we have been the victims of an assault, an organized media propaganda campaign to nurture apathy and hopelessness in our citizens. Our country is at war, a covert war waged within our own politic body, the enemy is embedded at every level of our government and the media. Their goal is clear, to destroy our Republic. Globalization, destroy national sovereignty, create national debt and a financial crisis, force open borders and mass immigration, permanently destroy our culture, dismantle the American family, those that don't assimilate will be silenced.\n\nFrom out of nowhere our last best hope has been delivered, a citizen statesman in our highest office. Trump is well aware of the corrupt enemy that is embedded within our branches of government. He has a plan to get control back, to punish those responsible and ultimately to expose and win the covert war to usurp our constitution. \n\nOur President's authority is decentralized, designed by our framers to act with neither efficiency nor dispatch. It is obvious the so-called political parties are in conflict. The House of Representatives and the Senate must be empowered to support our Chosen President's righteous task, to return our government to the people. Separate institutions sharing power in this time of war must coalesce, put aside their rivalries and cooperate to once again reestablish our federalist Republic. \n\nIn this time, our task to root out the corrupt elected and unelected bureaucrat's requires citizens to VOTE their value's not their party. Due to the mass propaganda effort some might have difficulty even defining the values our founders embedded at the core of our country. Let us reflect historically on some of our nations divinely inspired values your VOTE is fighting for.\n\n1. We value that all men being born free are endowed with rights to life and liberty; each individual's right to life is inviolable; each individual's liberty is considered an unalterable aspect of the human condition.\n\n2. We value our creator who endowed us with unalienable rights, truth is at the core each right, all men are equal under these righteous truths.\n\n3. We value each citizen having the right to pursue happiness unhampered.\n\n4. We value the right to speak and express ourselves freely.\n\n5. We value the right to freely exercise religious diversity.\n\n6. We value and protect property rights where people can freely acquire, use, and dispose of personal property.\n\n7. We the people give government it's powers for this strictly limited purpose of securing citizens' rights, the government shall have limited power which protect the rights of all citizens.\n\n8. We value individual Liberty, we are free to think, speak and act independently.\n\n9. We value the common good and community welfare.\n\n10. We value due process in the pursuit of justice, protected from denial or delay of justice.\n\n11. We value self-governance, of the people, by the people, for the people.\n\n12. We value Individual identity is held sacred and that dignity and integrity should not be violated\n\n13. We value that to secure these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed, that whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its Foundation on such Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall seem most likely to affect their Safety and Happiness.\n\n14. We value that all citizens have political and legal equality, treated as equals before the law we are not to be denied these rights unless by due process of law.\n\n15. We value the reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\n16. We value states having an equal voice in the senate and each state's influence in selecting the President as protected by our founder\u2019s grand federal design that respects the sovereign role of states via the Electoral College.\n\n17. We value strictly limited government, Federalism's separation of powers between our three branches of government, the bi-cameral legislation (House of Representatives &amp; Senate), Executive and judicial. We value checks and balances between each branch to limit the powers of the others.\n\n18. We value the right of the people to keep and bear arms, not to be infringed. We value the right to keep and bear arms to defend against mob rule, government tyranny and for the purpose of self-defense.\n\n19. We value true justice, a fair and equal system of rules and laws, administered with fairness and equality for all \n\n20. We value our citizens common defense by our government from another country or nation.\n\n21. We value domestic tranquility, living in a peaceful society where common people are protected.\n\nIn many ways our liberties, freedoms and values have already fallen victim in this covert war within America. Marxism has penetrated all levels of government agencies, especially the central bureaucracy. Whereas in the past the Federal Government was not involved in the education system, it is now predominant. Our children have been under attack, the education system has effectively been captured and is now doing the bidding of the enemy, threatening the future of our nation. Socialism, atheism, evolution, economic determinism, anti-traditional framework of sex and family, moral relativism and communism are all a part of the new American curriculum, taught every day in schools across America. This tactic has impacted every grade level even higher education. Destruction and corruption of the American education system has come to pass.\n\n\"Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of the teachers' associations. Put the party line in text books.\", The naked communist, W. Cleon Skousen. Goal achieved!\n\nOur country is being changed from within, this is your wakeup call. You are at war, whether you want it or not, you have no choice in this matter. America has been under attack for multiple generations, Sun Tzu would be proud, avoid strength attack weakness! America is likely the most transparent and open society on the planet. America's immigration, education and political systems are all identifiable weaknesses. Each of these systems has been used to penetrate our country from within. Elected officials are not required to have a background check once elected, they only need be a citizen for nine years, meet an age requirement and live in the state they wish to serve. Simple, yet effective, immigrate, run for office, serve in any capacity and continue moving up, rinse and repeat with 100's of agents. Now you have multiple levels of control within the American government. Influence and change culture, policies and laws. Alternatively, the enemy can also purchase corrupt traitors of America to do their bidding in the halls of power, with the same outcome. Infiltrate the education system using similar methods, accomplished much easier. Change literature, curriculum, and campus culture. Influence America's youth for generations, prepare the youth for communist and socialist agendas. Use the youth to advocate for the same agenda's, use the youth to create mobs, riots, atrocities and other public discord. This has already come to pass.\n\nAmerican's must realize the current battlespace, it is far reaching, well beyond this summary level text. Acknowledging we are active participant's in a covert war is a starting point. The next step is to take active steps taking a counter offensive where possible. This operation has bad actors within our own government, our own education system and in some cases our children have been turned against us. This seriously limits viable alternatives to fight back. Right now, we have a unique opportunity. Mid-term elections are right around the corner, your VOTE is the first salvo as a warrior of freedom.\n\n1.5 million American's have died wearing America's uniform since the founding of our country. This is your chance to be a warrior for our freedom, stomp on your complacency, shred your apathy, have faith in yourself and your countrymen, we can and will be victorious. Our American spirit may have been sleeping, but you can feel it waking, let it roar! In appreciation of our Liberty, the greatness of America we must fight, each and every one of us. Fight for yourself, for your children, for your countrymen, we must be victorious! \n\nAttention soldier, your direct fire weapon is your VOTE. You finally have an effective weapon in this prolonged battle. Vote your values not your party, these values are shared by everyone in our nation. Values are not party centric, this nation was organized based on our founders\u2019 values, they are embedded in the fabric of this country, in your community, in the constitution, the bill of rights and declaration of independence. \n\nTo achieve victory, we have to enable our president to enact the policies necessary to retake our country. We must not vote party lines, contemplate your principals, values, beliefs, ethics, and moral virtues. \n\nGovernment of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth. we must be engaged, WAKE UP, DRAW YOUR VOTING WEAPON, fire the KILL vote (shot) that will enable the retaking of our country. Vote Republican align the 3 branches of government, eliminate the resistance, deny the obstructionist, cease the delays, stop the destruction of our Country, VOTE REPUBLICAN.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"An American Catharsis"}

We'll have a march &amp; rally on DC on Saturday, October 27th, &amp; have brunch on Sunday, October 28th.  \n\n#For more information about the march, they\u2019ve set up an excellent website: [walkawaymarch.com](https:\/\/walkawaymarch.com)  \n \n\n#The [walkawaymarch](https:\/\/walkawaymarch.com) website includes a great new video by Straka titled: [It\u2019s Time. The #WalkAway March on Washington](https:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=LKUlrfCWSQQ), and is definitely worth checking out.\n\n*****    \n\n#Here is the full transcript of the video which was the source for the Sidebar Tribute quote:  \n\nOnce upon a time, I was a liberal. \n\nWell, to be honest, less than a year ago, I was still a liberal. \n\nI became a liberal because I felt I\u2019d found a tribe whose values aligned with my own. \n\nI staunchly reject racism of any kind, I reject the marginalization of any human being based off of their gender or sexual orientation. I reject tyrannical group think, I reject a system which allows an ambitious, misinformed, and dogmatic mob to suppress free speech, create false narratives, and apathetically steamroll over the truth. \n\nI reject the acceptance of junk science and superstition to advance ideological agendas.\n\nI reject hate. \n\nThese are the reasons why I became a liberal and these are the same reasons why I am now walking away.\n\n**For years now, I have watched as the left has devolved into intolerant, inflexible, illogical, hateful, misguided, ill-informed, un-American, hypocritical, menacing, callous, ignorant, narrow-minded, and at times, blatantly fascistic behavior and rhetoric.**\n\n**Liberalism has been co-opted and absorbed by the very characteristics it claims to fight against. For years now, I've watched as people on the left have become anesthetized to their own prejudices and bigotry and the prejudices and bigotry of those around them who echo their values. I have watched these formerly-sensible people, who claim to reject racism, have come to embrace the principles of universally hating and blaming all of society's problems on all people who have white skin. I have witnessed the irony of advocacy for gender equality morph into blatant hatred and intolerance of men and masculinity. I have seen the once-earnest fight for equality for the LGBT community mutate into an illogical demonization of heteronormativity and the push to vilify and attack our conventional concepts of gender.** \n\n**These same self-proclaimed victims of intolerance [are] now turning on the gay community that they once attached themselves to advance their agenda, [are] now calling gay people 'privileged' and themselves 'victims' of injustice. I have watched as the left has allowed themselves to become hypnotized by false narratives and conclusions, perpetuated by social justice warriors who misrepresent and misconstrue facts and evidence and events to confirm their own biases that everyone who does not comply with their prejudicial conclusions and follow their orders is a racist, a bigot, a Nazi, a white supremacist, homophobic, Islamophobic, xenophobic, misogynist, and alt-right extremist. And I've watched as they've used these heartless and carelessly-assigned labels to intimidate, threaten, bully, silence, attack, un-employ, blacklist, and destroy anybody who dares to fight back.** \n\n**They'll come for me and then they'll come for you.** \n\nAnd worst of all, the Democratic Party and the liberal media has embraced, affirmed, aided, and abetted this cult ideology. In an effort to gain voters and maintain power, the Democratic Party that I once loved has joined forces with the extremist left. The Democratic Party and the liberal media now believe their own ill-gotten conclusions and have ominously decided that they \u2013and only they \u2013 know the remedy for society's ills. \n\nThe Left has decided that the solution to problems with race relations in America is more racism. The Left believes that attacking, insulting, and dehumanizing one group of people elevates another. The Left now believes that there are no boundaries when telling lies, omitting the truth, or misrepresenting the facts when telling the news because their end justifies their means. The Left has now decided that its point of view is the only acceptable one and that suppressing, censoring, and banning open debate is virtuous and progressive. The Democratic Party has adopted a deleterious belief system, happily and without skepticism, separating people into groups based off of identity and then organizing them into camps of 'victims' and 'oppressors.' \n\nIf you are a person of color, an LGBT person, a woman, or an American immigrant, the Democratic Party wants you to know that you are a victim and destined to stay that way. They will insist that you are a victim doomed to exist within a system that is rigged against you, that you are a victim of systemic oppression, that you are a victim of your circumstances, and that no amount of hard work or motivational action will ever allow you to overcome your victimhood or the privilege of those around you. \n\nThis is perhaps the Democratic Party's greatest and most insidious lie. \n\nBut if you are a minority in America today, the left-wing politicians and the liberal media don't ever want you to ever discover this lie. So they bombard us with stories designed to reinforce this narrative that you are in danger, that you cannot succeed. They manipulate your fears and concerns by telling you that you are disadvantaged, disempowered, and disposable to everyone \u2013 except to them. They will tell you that you need them. They will tell you that you are only safe under their supervision. They will promise to liberate you from all that chains you. \n\nAnd then, they will do absolutely nothing for you. \n\n**Once upon a time I was a liberal. But liberalism has changed. And I will no longer be a part of an ideology or political party that represents everything that contradicts my values of unity, equal opportunity, personal empowerment, compassion, and love.** \n\n**So I am walking away.** \n\n**And I encourage all of you to do the same**. \n\n**Walk away.**  \n\n*****  \n\n#Join thousands of people just like you and #WalkAway  \n\n* **https:\/\/www.walkawaycampaign.com**    \n\n* **https:\/\/walkawaymarch.com**\n\n*****","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"My Sidebar Tribute choice is Brandon Straka, founder of the #WalkAway movement, in which thousands of people are walking away from the Democratic Party and bravely and publicly telling their stories on social media of why they are leaving. \u2014 Join thousands of people just like you and #WalkAway"}

{"author":"throwalkaway","created_utc":1540151175,"num_comments":130,"score":623,"selftext":"I'm posting this on a throwaway because I mostly only participate in gaming subs, including being a mod of a moderately sized one on my main account, and have some information on there that could potentially be used to dox me. That's been happening to people too much lately and since I really don't feel like taking the chance of getting doxxed by political crazies for a simple opinion, I figured making a new account to post this would be best. I'm sure I'll probably get called out by people on the left for it, but whatever, I felt like I really needed to share this and lately they usually believe whatever they want to believe anyway lol.\n\nFor most of my life I probably would have considered myself center-left on the political spectrum and have voted mostly for Democrats, with a couple of Republican governors and state reps sprinkled in. I was always raised to believe in things like equal rights for all, helping one another whenever possible, commitment to the truth, and compromise. I guess I've always thought, for the most part, that Democrats best represented those qualities. But over the past year or so I've come to see that just isn't the case anymore.\n\nSince Trump was elected, Democrat politicians have shown to be increasingly combative on almost every single issue, and usually just for the sake of being combative! So many things in this country still need to get done and Democrats continuously refuse to compromise. It's honestly a miracle that Trump has gotten as much done as he has with the stonewalling from Democrats. I just can't bring myself to side with a party that puts itself before their country any longer.\n\nAnother thing that has increasingly concerned me about the left is how radical their voting base has become. Antifa is violent and out of control. Other liberals hold marches and protests that shut down public streets every weekend just for the sake of attention and not any real issues. You just don't see that level of unhinged from the right. I worry that if it grows large enough and more of these people gain power that it could lead us down the path to socialism. While I still believe in having some form of basic social safety net, what these people want is pure and total socialism. We need to keep our sanity and not let this country end up like Venezuela.\n\nI think the straw that finally broke the camel's back though was the Kavenaugh hearings. The politicians and people on the left jumped on completely uncorroborated allegations as if they were cold hard truth. Republicans gave them every opportunity to come up with real proof, including an FBI investigation and they could not do it. I think this event more than any other perfectly showed to me who the real party of truth and objectivity was.\n\nThose being the major reasons, I will not be voting for Democrat candidates anymore and this is my #walkaway from that party. Maybe somewhere down the road, when some semblance of sanity and civility returns to that party I can reconsider my stance, but I won't be holding my breath.\n\n[**Edit:**](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/j58rudiuuer11.jpg) Wow! Already the #2 post, I can't believe all the attention this has gotten! Oh wait lol yes I can because holy shit you chuds are so fucking gullible (except for u\/sirjag, well done) and will believe any bullshit that will conform to your preconceived worldview. A little disappointed I couldn't beat out the megachud proud boy post at #1 though... I promised to hire a dozen more MS-13 illegals if it did but I'll settle for voting 50 times for AOC instead. WalkAway is right-wing astroturf. All cops are bastards. Communism will win. Conservatives are genetically predisposed to violence.

That's been happening to people too much lately and since I really don't feel like taking the chance of getting doxxed by political crazies for a simple opinion, I figured making a new account to post this would be best. I'm sure I'll probably get called out by people on the left for it, but whatever, I felt like I really needed to share this and lately they usually believe whatever they want to believe anyway lol.\n\nFor most of my life I probably would have considered myself center-left on the political spectrum and have voted mostly for Democrats, with a couple of Republican governors and state reps sprinkled in. I was always raised to believe in things like equal rights for all, helping one another whenever possible, commitment to the truth, and compromise. I guess I've always thought, for the most part, that Democrats best represented those qualities. But over the past year or so I've come to see that just isn't the case anymore.\n\nSince Trump was elected, Democrat politicians have shown to be increasingly combative on almost every single issue, and usually just for the sake of being combative! So many things in this country still need to get done and Democrats continuously refuse to compromise. It's honestly a miracle that Trump has gotten as much done as he has with the stonewalling from Democrats. I just can't bring myself to side with a party that puts itself before their country any longer.\n\nAnother thing that has increasingly concerned me about the left is how radical their voting base has become. Antifa is violent and out of control. Other liberals hold marches and protests that shut down public streets every weekend just for the sake of attention and not any real issues. You just don't see that level of unhinged from the right. I worry that if it grows large enough and more of these people gain power that it could lead us down the path to socialism. While I still believe in having some form of basic social safety net, what these people want is pure and total socialism. We need to keep our sanity and not let this country end up like Venezuela.\n\nI think the straw that finally broke the camel's back though was the Kavenaugh hearings. The politicians and people on the left jumped on completely uncorroborated allegations as if they were cold hard truth. Republicans gave them every opportunity to come up with real proof, including an FBI investigation and they could not do it. I think this event more than any other perfectly showed to me who the real party of truth and objectivity was.\n\nThose being the major reasons, I will not be voting for Democrat candidates anymore and this is my #walkaway from that party. Maybe somewhere down the road, when some semblance of sanity and civility returns to that party I can reconsider my stance, but I won't be holding my breath.\n\n[**Edit:**](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/j58rudiuuer11.jpg) Wow! Already the #2 post, I can't believe all the attention this has gotten! Oh wait lol yes I can because holy shit you chuds are so fucking gullible (except for u\/sirjag, well done) and will believe any bullshit that will conform to your preconceived worldview. A little disappointed I couldn't beat out the megachud proud boy post at #1 though... I promised to hire a dozen more MS-13 illegals if it did but I'll settle for voting 50 times for AOC instead. WalkAway is right-wing astroturf. All cops are bastards. Communism will win. Conservatives are genetically predisposed to violence.

Jump to timestamp 52:28 [https:\/\/youtu.be\/l5OUmoa9rME?t=3148](https:\/\/youtu.be\/l5OUmoa9rME?t=3148) Remarks continue to 54:20.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, that's the president of the USA saying that all the citizens of this state who went out in their \"little boats\", volunteering to help save neighbors and strangers are a bunch of dumbasses doing it to impress their wives and should do him a favor and stay home next time so the Coast Guard doesn't have to rescue them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOr maybe you think he's talking about non-existent hurricane gawkers off the Gulf Coast, even though the Coast Guard says the vast majority of their rescues during Harvey were inland and their sea rescues were primarily tugboats and commercial vessels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne might think this just accidental misinformation, except he's made the same remarks a few months ago and people tried to correct him then: [https:\/\/www.chron.com\/news\/houston-texas\/houston\/article\/Is-Texas-ready-for-another-Harvey-12972164.php](https:\/\/www.chron.com\/news\/houston-texas\/houston\/article\/Is-Texas-ready-for-another-Harvey-12972164.php)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you vote Republican because you truly feel their party stance on health care or corporate taxes or gun control is what best fits you, I get it, I truly do.  Not even going to try and talk you out of that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut please, stop laughing and clapping and cheering while this piece of shit excuse for a human being is attacking your fellow Texans and the selflessness they exercised trying to rescue both neighbors and strangers alike during one of the biggest storms to hit this country in recorded history.  Hell, a \"boo!\" might be pretty nice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*EDIT: Re-emphasizing the above point since people keep missing it and I'm tired of replying about it.  Yes, the president could've been referring to storm chasers, but the problem with that is that those stormchasers don't exist!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe coast guard was not out saving suicidal idiots sailing their small craft into a freaking category 4 hurricane.  The whole notion of this is absurd.  It's like suggesting that Texans are so stupid that we run into burning buildings to watch the fire up close until the fire department can save us.  No one from coast guard, EMS, or state government can identify any instance of this having happened.  It's a story that the president has made up about Texans and what a bunch of rubes we are in order to make the performance of the Coast Guard look even better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe's either mocking real heroes, or he's mocking non-existent morons, and in either case he's slandering our state.  I'm not asking anyone to change their vote over this, just to put Texas first and speak up when he spreads these kinds of lies in the future.  This is the second time he's made these remarks so it's obviously something he plans to keep on doing until his supporters call him out for it. \\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*EDIT #2: Someone did link this article from the New York Times that the Coast Guard rescued 32 boaters and that's probably who Trump was referring to: [https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/08\/26\/us\/hurricane-harvey-texas-coast-guard-rescue.html](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/08\/26\/us\/hurricane-harvey-texas-coast-guard-rescue.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEven if that's exactly who he was referring to, those are still much more likely to be people who were trying to get their boats out of the area ahead of the storm and were just too slow and got caught -vs- deranged suicidal morons with deathwishes intentionally sailing into a hurricane to impress their wives.  I'd count these people among the victims of the hurricane and I don't consider it any better for the president to mock them than it would have been to mock the people using their boats for rescues.  Mocking storm victims is completely unnecessary in order to praise the Coast Guard for their service.\\*","subreddit":"texas","title":"Trump craps all over Houston &amp; Gulf Coast.

I quickly adapted to the American way of life, learned to speak English, deeply studied the history of this country, and did my best. Fun fact: I was the only student in a class of 60 to get a 5 on the AP United States History exam in high school. One of the coolest moments of my youth, and it happened during a deep bout of shame shortly after I found out I was undocumented.\n\nWhen I was eighteen, I had the choice to leave and go back to my birth country. I loved the USA too much and couldn\u2019t part with it. I understand many of you will think that, in order to be philosophically consistent, I should have left as soon as I was able, and I respect that. I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it. \n\nI do think DACA was an overreach of executive power. I think the President does have the right to prioritze enforcement more or less in certain areas, but the creation of social programs is not within his rights. I accepted it to contribute to my household and work, which I couldn\u2019t do before that. \n\nI believe the Democratic Party panders to the poor and to immigrant families because they know that these people come from socialist or socialist-leaning countries and will vote Democrat when naturalized. It makes me sick.\n\nGod-willing, I\u2019ll likely be getting married next year to my girlfriend and eventually naturalized. The day I become a US citizen will easily be one of the proudest moments of my life. My children will never forget how God smiled on them by letting them be born here.\n\nWhen the day comes that I can finally vote, I\u2019ll be voting for the Party that trusts Americans with their own money, protects our rights to defend ourselves against tyranny, and stands up for the family unit.\n\nIf for whatever reason I\u2019m deported, even if it\u2019s by this administration, I have NO RIGHT to hate this country or complain. It gave me an incredible upbringing, education and memories. I have a college degree that would surge me into the top 1% wherever I go. \n\nDon\u2019t let the left fool you: there are immigrants on the right that love this country and what it stands for.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I\u2019m a DACA recipient and have been a PROUD conservative for years.

I believe something feeding this problem is that we have nothing to rally around as a country. So many things have become political I feel like we've lost our identity as a country and we need to come together. It's clear to me that those on the far left don't want to unite, they seek only to destroy in hopes of rebuilding the country as a fantasy utopia. However there are many more people who want to return to a more united America. As nice as it would be to \"own the libs\" into submission, that's not a viable or even desirable solution. \n  \nBen Shapiro often talks about the tearing of social fabric when things we once all shared, like football, become political. I think a possible way forward is to identify things that all Americans can and should unite under. These can be values, ideas, cultural events, holidays, pieces of media, art, whatever. I think we've gotten very good at what it means to be conservative and what it means to be progressive but we've lost what it means to be American. There will always be those who don't want to unite no matter what, but I think they're a small, yet loud, minority.

Social justice, urban renewal and development, the provision of decent dwellings, and healthy conditions for the people can only be achieved if land is used in the interests of society as a whole*.\n\n[https:\/\/capitalresearch.org\/article\/resettling-refugees-part-2\/](https:\/\/capitalresearch.org\/article\/resettling-refugees-part-2\/)\n\nThe Voluntary Agencies or VOLAGs are private, tax-exempt organizations that resettle refugees for the U.S. government. There are nine VOLAGs, six of which are nominally religious, and these organizations often promote their resettlement activity as a biblical mission. However, VOLAGs are strictly prohibited by regulation from any form of proselytization to refugees. In reality, they are simply government contractors paid handsomely for their services.\n\n[https:\/\/capitalresearch.org\/article\/resettling-refugees-part-3\/](https:\/\/capitalresearch.org\/article\/resettling-refugees-part-3\/)\n\nTogether these nonprofits siphon millions of dollars from the federal government, spreading the gospel of immigration as they line their own pockets and perpetuate an agenda that advantages the Left as it dismisses justifiable concerns from communities strained by the needs of these newcomers. \n\n[https:\/\/capitalresearch.org\/](https:\/\/capitalresearch.org\/) ","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Resettling Refugees: An International Agenda"}

Everyone (the media in particular) gets satisfaction from assuming malice of others and both the left and right are guilty of this. For example the left are quick to assume malice of supporters of the second amendment and NRA members as hicks that don\u2019t care about children being murdered in school shootings instead as seeing them as genuine individuals concerned for their individual rights to self defense. On the flip side when someone on the left says that they support socialized healthcare the right is quick to assume malice as well and see them as a freeloader that just wants control as opposed to seeing them as someone who genuinely wants better healthcare for all and is proposing a different means of achieving it. Him talking about this made me realize just how much of an issue this is. THIS is why our political climate in the U.S is so toxic. THIS is why everyone comes off as a judgmental assholes on Twitter.

And eat and sleep and store their clothes?  And how is it that after a week on the road they are clean and their hair and clothes are well kept?\n\n        How is any of this possible?\n\n        And why do these people, supposedly fleeing intolerable conditions in their homeland, carry little flags from their homeland and break into its national anthem when the TV cameras show up?  And speaking of which, for oppressed people, they all seem to be pretty well fed, well groomed and well dressed. Their hair is neat and newly cut, their clothes are clean and in good repair, and they are built like people who have had ample nutrition all their lives, being well developed and, many of them, overweight.\n\n        And none of them look dirty or unkempt, like they had been sleeping on the ground for the last week.  There\u2019s just nothing in any of this that makes sense.  Supposedly, these several thousand people spontaneously decided to leave Honduras, walking north in a group, hoping to trek the length of gang-plagued Mexico and present themselves as refugees and prospective Democrats at the American border.   Which, again, makes no sense whatsoever.\n\n        And leaves a lot of big questions unanswered, and ignored by the press. Such as, who organized this? Who is paying for it? How have they covered 500 miles in a week?  Seriously. Any number of American \u201creporters\u201d have walked beside a sympathetic walker and talked about how this particular woman and her children had trekked half a thousand miles over the last week or so.  That\u2019s 71 miles a day.\n\n  The best soldiers through history have been able to march 25 miles a day.  How have 7,000 people been fed and watered? And how have they gone to the bathroom? If the average person across the world produces about a pound of solid waste a day, that means that these folks are somehow disposing of more than three tons of feces each day.  That\u2019s a heck of a lot of crap, even for a Central American roadway.\n\n        Provisioning such an army of people \u2013 the equivalent of 10 combat battalions in most of the world\u2019s military \u2013 is a large task. Transporting and distributing the food and water necessary to keep those people moving is a massive chore which the press says nothing about.  The entire enterprise, as a spontaneous ad hoc event, is implausible.\n\n        As an orchestrated international attempt to influence an American election, it starts to make sense.  And ought to alarm us.  Unless it\u2019s only Russians we don\u2019t want screwing with our democracy.  Unfortunately, none of this has made the evening news. It\u2019s almost as if the press, in whatever scheme is afoot, gladly accepts its role as propagandists to the American people.\n\n        Every story is sympathetic, as if an attempt to enlist viewers and readers in this caravan and the politics it symbolizes.  And so the story is not about an orchestrated attempt to manipulate electoral opinion and violate the borders and laws of the United States, it is about compassion and Trump and xenophobia and racism. It is the October surprise, it is the Blue Wave.  And it is all nonsense.\n\n        Because all of these people, if legitimate, have the ability to apply for American asylum in their own country \u2013 as do the residents of most nations of the world. We have consulates and embassies for a reason, and this is one of those reasons.\n\n        We also have laws and an oath of office for a reason.  Laws, so that \u201cwe the people\u201d through our elected representatives clearly and systematically govern our society. Law is the means by which the people express and exercise their sovereignty. Disobedience to law is disobedience to the will of the people, it is the subverting of their sovereignty and franchise.\n\n        Breaking the law is denying you the vote. Your vote elects representatives \u2013 lets you pick the country\u2019s direction \u2013 and the representatives write the law. If that law is ignored, your representation becomes meaningless.  You get screwed.  And the oath of office?\n\n        Members of Congress \u2013 even Democrats \u2013 swear an oath to \u201cbear true faith and allegiance\u201d to the Constitution, which establishes our system of laws and specifically charges the Congress with making the rules of naturalization and immigration.  Who comes across the border and under what conditions they can stay is a constitutional responsibility of the Congress. That is to be determined by a congressional vote, not by a Honduran mob.\n\n        Failure to insist on that \u2013 even for Democrats \u2013 is a violation of your congressman\u2019s oath of office.  So there is not a Democrat or Republican response to this travelling army of invaders \u2013 there is only an American response.  And that is: Turn around and go home.\n\n        Because the law of the United States does not allow a mass entry like this. The law does not declare the borders open.  If Democrats and progressives don\u2019t like that, they can try to change the law. If America\u2019s progressives want open borders and believe all the world\u2019s people have a right to live in the United States \u2013 as they say they do \u2013 then they should adjust immigration law accordingly.\n\n        But until then, if they are to keep their oaths of office, they must stand for the law and the border.  And they must tell their surrogates to turn around and go home.  Because this caravan is nothing more than a bunch of political s***(crap).\n                        - by Bob Lonsberry \u00a9 2018","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The Caravan of Crap"}

I have grown up with southern values in a religious\/spiritual house hold. I became an atheist because when I looked into all the arguments for god\u2019s (or gods) existence I wasn\u2019t convince there was one(or many) and simply don\u2019t believe now. Although I did become Liberal for a while just off the bases all other atheist are and didn\u2019t want to vote for a religious party, but now I pretty much said fuck that. I am very conservative to heart and I truly believe, now, that if you are an atheist you should be conservative.\n\nLet\u2019s start going through some of the issues. I\u2019m pro-life. I believe that there is only one shot at life no one know if there is a before or after, all we know what is here and now and to take that way from someone I think is inhumane and wrong. Not to mention the majority of abortions are done by minorities, helping to keep them minorities, which is what i truly believe liberals want. \n\nI am pro gun. It seems logical to me that if a bad person has a gun, to stop him, a good person needs a gun. The idea that if we make guns harder to get things will get better is bullshit. These people have never taken a basic economics class in school. You learn that anytime the government makes something illegal a black market will open for that good, so people will still get guns and probably not the good law abiding ones. All that doesn\u2019t is make good citizens not be able to Defend themselves. Also from a scientific perspective, we have always had a way to defend ourselves throughout our history as humans, this possibly being hundreds of thousands or a few million years of existence, and now all the sudden we just throw that out the window because people are so great and would never do us harm... fuck that.\n\nI\u2019m for the economy and businesses. I\u2019m a business student so that explains this point. But serious if you taken any business classes and actually learned anything you would not like taxes and understand why lower taxes is always a good thing for both businesses and individuals. \n\nNow let\u2019s talk about LGBT issues. First off, I just don\u2019t think there particularly helpful. We been in existence for a long time and for most of our history we couldn\u2019t afford to have only gay people, mainly for the survival of our species. So gay marriage and all that I don\u2019t care about really. But the trans-people I think there is something wrong with them. I think it is a mental disorder. Once again we have been a around for a very long time and now to say fuck all that I want to be something else just doesn\u2019t add up. Your telling me that you have a girl brain in a guy\u2019s body, for fuck sake people. Not to mention I have seen some weird shit from these people like a trans-man is now a dog, like what? I honestly think people just need to embrace who they are as people, it is ok to be a man, it is ok to be a women. There are men that like feminine things and women that like masculine things, but you don\u2019t have to change your gender or whatever to like things and be yourself. Even if people find certain things weird because you\u2019re a guy or girl, who gives a fuck. Be ok with the way you were born. \n\nLastly, I want to talk about this idea of liberals being the party for atheists simply because they are the \u201cnon-religious\u201d group. First off I think is completely untrue. They have been supporting Islam a lot lately through everything I have seen. If there is something I disagree with more than christianity, it would have to be Islam. Like for fuck sake people, this groups actively believes in killing people like me simply because I disagree with them on religion. And you want to support a party that supports that idea. At least when I\u2019m supporting the \u201cChristian\u201d party these are the people that even allow me to be atheist and not be forced to believe or killed for disagreeing with them. Also I feel I have to point this out (below)because many atheist try to disagree with this point and I don\u2019t get it, it doesn\u2019t validate the existence god. That is our country was founded and started by Christian ideas and beliefs. The idea that you should choose to believe or not is up to you is not something you see of other religions and I would argue the only reason why I can even be an atheist and not be killed for it is because the majority are Christian, most other religion aren\u2019t this kind. And yes I realize it may have not always been like that in England and before, but what is now is what matters to this point. \n\nSo, after all that I hope y\u2019all can see why I think if you\u2019re an atheist you should be conservative. Also, why we can be friends and not enemies. Share this with a friend that is an atheist and see if it helps change there mind on what party they want to vote for.\n\nP.s. I\u2019m bad at grammar. Please don\u2019t attack me over that, attack my ideas.\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I\u2019m an atheist conservative.

What does the Voice of Prophecy for today have to say regarding the appointment of justice Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court?  That story forms the feature article of the current edition of The King\u2019s Journal, which was first written and published on July 10th, over 70 days before his confirmation to the bench of America\u2019s highest Appellate Court.  This story is worth reading for \u201cthere is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and maketh known to the\u201d  children of men today, (Dan. 2: 28), as verily as He did in Daniel\u2019s day, the truths of His word and of the things that are coming upon the earth, thereby preparing a people for His Kingdom.\n\nPlease follow this link to the current edition of The King\u2019s Journal: HKM NL 2018 2 Oct (1) R2\n\nThe TRUMP Effect\n\nLove him or hate him, Donald Trump will go down in history as one of America\u2019s most consequential presidents, and when he wins a second term in 2020, the light will turn on in the minds of many, that \u201cAmerica is truly Great Again\u201d\u2013great enough to lead the world by force into a religio-economic stranglehold called \u201cthe Mark of the Beast\u201d system.

I just want to offer my two cents as a conservative Asian American on this issue. Harvard says they don't discriminate against Asians because we apparently have shit personalities(no joke) the New York Times revealed they use 200 factors on admission decisions and one of them was \"Personality Score\". Why they reject so many overqualified Asians is because they're all \"hard workers\" and \"want to be a doctor.\" Apparently, that's what we're only capable of because all we do is memorize shit and are robots (sarcasm). But what about all the Black\/Hispanics that get in with far lower SAT scores and grades? No one actually answers that and instead attacks me by calling me a racist for pointing out the data. Asians need to score 450 points higher than blacks for an equal chance. If you look at the recent incoming class it's 22% Asian and 15% Black. Statistically Asians and Blacks are at the opposite ends of the academic spectrum. High schools that are majority black are failures. Would you want to send your kid to a high school that's 90% black? Hell no, the education sucks and your kid is probably gonna get beat up and bullied relentlessly. Not being racist, statistically majority black high schools also tend to be the most violent. Now look at schools that are majority Asian, they tend to be among the best. So how the f is there only a 7% gap between Asians and Blacks at Harvard. At schools where there aren't race based admissions the gap is usually 5-7X the black student population. Example, look at NYC specialized High schools (Stuy, Brooklyn Tech) that are merit based only aka entrance exams (sadly going to shit because of socialist mayor). It's astonishing that Asians aren't atleast triple the black percentages. It's pretty clear a lot of the more deserving Asian students are being discriminated against in order to take in less qualified blacks\/hispanics for the sake of diversity over merit. I'm supporting the Supreme Court and hope they win against Harvard. What is everyone's thoughts on this affirmative action case?\n\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Diversity Vs Meritocracy"}

Harvard biologist George Wald estimated in 1970 that **\u201ccivilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind.\u201d**\n2. **\u201cWe   are in an environmental crisis which threatens the survival of this   nation, and of the world as a suitable place of human habitation,\u201d** wrote Washington University biologist Barry Commoner in the Earth Day issue of the scholarly journal Environment.\n3. The   day after the first Earth Day, the New York Times editorial page   warned, \u201cMan must stop pollution and conserve his resources, not merely   to enhance existence but to save the race from intolerable  deterioration  and possible extinction.\u201d\n4. \u201cPopulation   will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in   food supplies we make,\u201d Paul Ehrlich confidently declared in the April   1970 issue of Mademoiselle. \u201cThe death rate will increase until at least   100-200 million people per year will be starving to death during the   next ten years.\u201d\n5. **\u201cMost of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born,\u201d**   wrote Paul Ehrlich in a 1969 essay titled \u201cEco-Catastrophe! \u201cBy\u2026\\[1975\\]   some experts feel that food shortages will have escalated the present   level of world hunger and starvation into famines of unbelievable   proportions. Other experts, more optimistic, think the ultimate   food-population collision will not occur until the decade of the 1980s.\u201d\n6. Ehrlich   sketched out his most alarmist scenario for the 1970 Earth Day issue  of  The Progressive, assuring readers that between 1980 and 1989, some 4   billion people, including 65 million Americans, would perish in the   \u201cGreat Die-Off.\u201d\n7. **\u201cIt is already too late to avoid mass starvation,\u201d** declared Denis Hayes, the chief organizer for Earth Day, in the Spring 1970 issue of The Living Wilderness.\n8. Peter   Gunter, a North Texas State University professor, wrote in 1970,   \u201cDemographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: **by   1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by 1990   to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East, Africa. By   the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central America will   exist under famine conditions\u2026.By the year 2000, thirty years from now,   the entire world, with the exception of Western Europe, North America,   and Australia, will be in famine.\u201d**\n9. In   January 1970, Life reported, \u201cScientists have solid experimental and   theoretical evidence to support\u2026the following predictions: In a decade,   urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air pollution\u2026**by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half\u2026.\u201d**\n10. Ecologist Kenneth Watt told Time that, \u201cAt the present rate of nitrogen buildup, **it\u2019s only a matter of time before light will be filtered out of the atmosphere and none of our land will be usable.\u201d**\n11. Barry   Commoner predicted that decaying organic pollutants would use up all  of  the oxygen in America\u2019s rivers, causing freshwater fish to  suffocate.\n12. Paul Ehrlich chimed in, predicting **in 1970 that \u201cair pollution\u2026is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next few years alone.\u201d** Ehrlich sketched a scenario in which 200,000 Americans would die in 1973 during \u201csmog disasters\u201d in New York and Los Angeles.\n13. Paul   Ehrlich warned in the May 1970 issue of Audubon that DDT and other   chlorinated hydrocarbons \u201cmay have substantially reduced the life   expectancy of people born since 1945.\u201d Ehrlich warned that **Americans born since 1946\u2026now had a life expectancy of only 49 years,**   and he predicted that if current patterns continued this expectancy   would reach 42 years by 1980, when it might level out. (Note: According   to the most recent CDC report, life expectancy in the US is 78.8  years).\n14. Ecologist Kenneth Watt declared, **\u201cBy   the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude   oil at such a rate\u2026that there won\u2019t be any more crude oil.** You\u2019ll drive up to the pump and say, Fill \u2018er up, buddy,\u2019 and he\u2019ll say,  \nI am very sorry, there isn\u2019t any.\u2019\u201d\n15. Harrison   Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a   chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves and **estimated   the humanity would totally run out of copper shortly after 2000. Lead,   zinc, tin, gold, and silver would be gone before 1990.**\n16. Sen. Gaylord Nelson wrote in Look that, \u201cDr. S. Dillon Ripley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institute, believes that **in 25 years, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.\u201d**\n17. **In   1975, Paul Ehrlich predicted that \u201csince more than nine-tenths of the   original tropical rainforests will be removed in most areas within the   next 30 years or so,** it is expected that half of the organisms in these areas will vanish with it.\u201d\n18. Kenneth   Watt warned about a pending Ice Age in a speech. \u201cThe world has been   chilling sharply for about twenty years,\u201d he declared. **\u201cIf   present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder   for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in   the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into an   ice age.\u201d**\n\nOriginal Article [Here](https:\/\/www.aei.org\/publication\/18-spectacularly-wrong-predictions-made-around-the-time-of-first-earth-day-in-1970-expect-more-this-year-2\/)","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"18 examples of the spectacularly wrong predictions made around the first \"Earth Day\" in 1970, that have cost society BILLIONS.

This is a shocking story, and a massive wake up call to just how toxic SJWism really is. We're starting to see what we've always known will happen- creeping fascism and absolute extreme cases of double standards in law happening quietly, hidden from the public. There's absolutely no way to defend this story, IMO it needs to become a priority and should be spread EVERYWHERE.\n\nThis is an absolutely disgusting story that is hard to believe, but shows just how toxic and disingenuous modern day SJW feminism is becoming. A woman in Canada was found guilty of 3 counts of child molestation and child pornography. I'm not going to get into the details of what she did, you can read it in the link above, but rest assured that it was beyond disgusting. She used her mouth on toddlers in a very explicit way- that should be an image enough.\n\n\nHowever, the judge has decided that she is NOT a dangerous offender because of a road of logic that's nothing short of manipulative and disingenuous beyond belief. Let me post the section of the article below describing the reasoning of the judge, and psychological \"expert\":\n\n\n\n&gt;Earlier this year, McEwen also pleaded guilty to sexual assault and two child pornography offences. She was sentenced to six years. But what the presiding judge would not do was declare McEwen a dangerous offender, which the Crown had sought and with impassioned urgency.In rejecting the long-term offender order, Justice Kathleen Caldwell weighed the various criteria that must be met, primarily a \u201csubstantial risk of reoffence.\u201d\nCaldwell determined that McEwen wasn\u2019t such a risk, relying heavily on the evidence and psychiatric report prepared by a forensic psychiatrist with expertise in paraphilia and sexual deviancy.\n\n&gt;Dr. Mark Pearce was agreed upon as an expert witness by both the Crown and the defence when he testified in February. He diagnosed McEwen as a masochist and low-risk to reoffend.\nCaldwell accepted Pearce\u2019s conclusion that McEwen derived sexual arousal not from acts committed against children but from the \u201cextreme humiliation\u201d of her involvement in those acts, which fed her masochism, described as on the moderately severe end.\n\n&gt;The judge wrote (and read aloud in court): \u201cDr. Pearce testified that the current research suggests that women do not suffer from paraphilic disorders apart from masochism. This fact lends further weight to the conclusion that pedophilia does not apply to you.\u201d\nCrown Attorney Lisa Henderson, the judge noted, had \u201crigorously challenged\u201d Pearce on this assertion.\n\n&gt;(I) agree that at first blush it appears illogical that women do not suffer from other paraphilic disorders,\u201d Caldwell continued. \u201cSometimes, however, that which appears reasonable is anything but and vice versa. I accept the doctor\u2019s evidence on this point. He did agree that this conclusion might change in the future as psychiatry continues to develop, but I cannot base my conclusions on speculative potential that have yet to develop.\u201d\n\n\nIn short- because the psychiatrist said women are *usually* not pedophiles, McEwan wasn't an actual pedophile, and so isn't an actual dangerous offender. Let's break this down:\n\n\n\n&gt;But what the presiding judge would not do was declare McEwen a dangerous offender, which the Crown had sought and with impassioned urgency.\nIn rejecting the long-term offender order, Justice Kathleen Caldwell weighed the various criteria that must be met, primarily a \u201csubstantial risk of reoffence.\u201d\n\nSo, the judge finds that **three-time child molester** is **not** a dangerous offender, because she has a low risk of reoffending. What was the logic behind believing that she has a low risk of re-offending?\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Caldwell determined that McEwen wasn\u2019t such a risk, relying heavily on the evidence and psychiatric report prepared by a forensic psychiatrist with expertise in paraphilia and sexual deviancy.\nDr. Mark Pearce was agreed upon as an expert witness by both the Crown and the defence when he testified in February. He diagnosed McEwen as a masochist and low-risk to reoffend.\n\n&gt;Caldwell accepted Pearce\u2019s conclusion that McEwen derived sexual arousal not from acts committed against children but from the \u201cextreme humiliation\u201d of her involvement in those acts, which fed her masochism, described as on the moderately severe end.\n\n\nSo, she enjoys sexual acts with children, but because the part she likes about molesting children is the humiliation, she isn't *really* a pedophile. She **specifically prefers sex with children**, but because of her *reason* for preferring such, she isn't a dangerous offender or risk to do it again.\n\nThe judge:\n\n\n&gt;(I) agree that at first blush it appears illogical that women do not suffer from other paraphilic disorders,\u201d Caldwell continued. \u201cSometimes, however, that which appears reasonable is anything but and vice versa. I accept the doctor\u2019s evidence on this point. He did agree that this conclusion might change in the future as psychiatry continues to develop, but I cannot base my conclusions on speculative potential that have yet to develop\n\nWhich is completely absurd...there is a clear pattern of behavior, there is no sensible debate that this women enjoys sex acts with children. This reasoning from the judge is entirely manipulative and disingenuous- it makes no sense to \"Accept the doctors evidence\" when the evidence is very clearly refuted by the very facts of the case.\n\n\n\nAfter the trial, Dr Pearce gave the following statement:\n\n&gt;In an interview this week with the Star, Pearce emphasized the scarcity of research literature on female sex offenders.\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying there\u2019s no such thing as a female pedophile, but it is almost an exclusively male disorder.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not to say no woman has it. There may be some outliers. But women (sex offenders) usually offend for other reasons, not because of an innate sexual attraction to children.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis makes absolutely no sense...so the crux of his argument is that even though women are USUALLY not pedophiles, a woman who **molests three children** isn't an actual pedophile. \n\n\n&gt;There may be some outliers. But women (sex offenders) usually offend for other reasons, not because of an innate sexual attraction to children.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut how does that negate the actual crime? Why wouldn't that person be a dangerous offender if they've committed the crime **multiple times?** You can see elsewhere in the already she had **multiple** counts of child pornography from previous cases- how is that not enough to find her a dangerous offender? The \"reason\" for such doesn't change how dangerous her offenses are. She has a habitual tendency to commit heinous sex crimes with children. She specifically desires to commit sex acts with children, by any reasonable standard, she is a habitual child molester and sex offender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","subreddit":"MensRights","title":"We should be trying to spread the story of the Canadian court who found the female pedophile non-dangerous.""num_comments":2,"score":74,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Canadian court declares that women can't legaly be pedophiles.

I was only exposed to the left side through school and home, and really didn\u2019t know what \u201cconservative\u201d was at all. All I knew is that my friends were all liberal and they severely demonized the right, so I figured I was liberal too. I eventually had a class on politics, and that\u2019s when things started to turn a little bit. When learning about democrats and republicans I realized that none of my internal beliefs actually lined up with the liberal side, and I was really confused. I had a faint feeling about everything being off but I of course didn\u2019t put much action into it and ignored my gut feeling. Couple years later as J got older I started becoming more interested in politics, I wanted to speak about how I felt, but I couldn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t know anything. I actually had no background for any of my statements and wanted to gather some in order to be relevant in giving an opinion. I did a lot of research in both sides through articles, videos, channels, etc. For some reason the majority of the pro-left content I viewed was irritating and none of it seemed reasonable, throwing me off because I figured the left side was the go-to. But when I viewed pro-right content it was much more different. People started making sense to me, and I was seeing things in a different light than I did before. It was kind of intense and while this sounds corny as hell, it was really a revelation for me. I\u2019ve found something I can fit into and identify as, it\u2019s actually pretty nice. Anyone else experience something similar? Sorry for the essay lmfao ","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I Used to be Liberal"}

There were a myriad of reasons, but the main one was their politics. Every day at work I had to hear how awful Trump and his supporters are. Every day I had SJW politics shoved down my throat. Every day I\u2019d wake up dreading putting on the globe and driving to work.\n\n It was a great opportunity, financially. It paid better than anywhere I\u2019ve seen for someone without a college degree. But money isn\u2019t everything. I felt like every time I got dressed in the morning with their company logo, I was selling a piece of my soul.\n\nI was reported to HR for being a racist a few months ago by an employee for correcting her as she and the other \u201cladies\u201d were discussing Trump. It was during the whole \u201cTrump is separating kids from their parents at the border\u201d fiasco that\u2019s been going on since Clinton. I simply informed her that it was existing policy brought forth by a Democrat President.\n\nThe investigation yielded no results, obviously, however I was denied my request to transfer three times following this incident. Of the three times I applied, I only even got one interview. Keep in mind that per AT&amp;T policy, managers requesting a transfer are to be given priority. Each time, they hired a female person of color. Now I have absolutely no problem with this if the candidate is as qualified or more qualified, however that was not the case.\n\nTo put it simply, I feel that due to people inferring my political leanings, I\u2019ve been denied opportunities. Perhaps that\u2019s the case, perhaps not. I\u2019ve spoken with my family attorney and they believe I may have an EEO case. I have yet to decide whether to pursue this avenue. What I really would like to know, are there any conservative companies hiring? Do they even exist anymore? Or is everyone now completely bought into identity politics and leftist politics?\n\nAny feedback, or criticism (I welcome it, not fear it) is appreciated.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I quit my job today"}

Sadly, these comments and posts are not removed and the sub itself is riddled with calls for violence against both Jews and Muslims - Further to this it makes use to Anti-semetic memes which are disguised as something else, their use of the NPC meme further adds to the idea that Muslims and Jews and women and gays are not human while encouraging violence against them.   \n\n\nTheir defense of alleged alcoholic rapist Kavanaugh is yet another notch in their belt of venom against the vulnerable, to attack victims of rape, and promote a rapist as some kind of moral paragon and man of the people shines a light on the kind of thinking that is rife in that sub.  \n\n\nWe, as decent humans who stand up for whats right, we on \/r\/socialism and other subs which defend those who are wrongfully attacked must call on \/u\/spez to remove this subreddit and ban it entirely.

I say this because i generally notice it all over the place, whenever i talk about something  controversial (Usually anonymously) it's usually the people in the mid  20's to early 30's that tend to be the most hostile. But the ones  between 13-18, i tend to find are the ones with the best heads on their  shoulders, or at the very least the ones who are open minded enough to  have an actual discussion. So from my personal experience, crowders claims do actually have some merit.  \n\n\nSo this begs the question...  how did I slip through the cracks? I'm easily in the millennial territory  and yet i don't act like the stereotypical entitled man-child of this  generation at all. I mean Yeah i was sheltered, but it was mostly for my  own safety, and apparently i was never all that interested in going out  much anyway. I was also kind of a late bloomer, i didn't get into gaming proper until i was 10, i didn't get my own computer until i was  15 or so and I've only recently started actually using social media  sites on a regular basis. Frankly If i could sum up my life in one  sentence it's \"Late to the party\"  \n\n\nSo I basically have this very  weird mindset where i was born in the millennial generation but i think  like a generation z'er. I honestly regret heavily not being as social as  i could, but now i wonder, did i dodge a massive bullet being such an  introvert growing up?

Interestingly enough, if you take all of the polls recorded for Obama, a Gallup poll done on 6\/19\/09 being the first one, and take the aggregate of all of them up until he left office and found the average, the average percentage of people who said the country was on the wrong track was ~63%. If you do the same for Trump up until present time, his is sitting at a crisp ~55%. Derive from these numbers what you will, but dare I say the country as a whole thinks we're moving in the right direction more so in the present than with Obama at the helm.\n\nEdit: it's late","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Interesting Statistic Comparing Trump to Obama"}

{"author":"plow_ur_ass","created_utc":1541015118,"num_comments":1,"score":8,"selftext":"I hear this talking point from liberals all the time, especially since these MagaBomber and synagogue shooting stories broke. It's always some variation of the following two talking points:\n\n&gt;\"Since September 12th, 2001, right wing terrorism has accounted for 73 percent of all extremist incidents in the United States.\"\n\n&gt;\"Since 1993, 85% of terror incidents in the United States have been caused by right wing groups.\"\n\nAnd they always link to either a study by the GAO or by the ADL. \n\nThe problem is, **\"racist white guy\" does not equate to \"right wing\" by default.** At least not in the sense of being fairly lumped in with American Right Wing politics. Furthermore, the incidents these reports cite are clearly not acts of extremism or terrorism anyway. \n\nFor example, here's the GAO repot:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.gao.gov\/assets\/690\/683984.pdf\n\nJust scroll down to page 30 to see their list of incidents. It's obvious what's going on. The overwhelming majority of these incidents are clearly just totally non-political gang violence. Here are some examples of their \"right wing incidents.\"\n\n&gt; White supremacist murders Hispanic man in convenience store after argument\n\n&gt; Two white supremacists murdered a gay man as gang initiation rite\n\n&gt; White supremacist murdered his stepfather to gain \u201cstreet cred\u201d\n\n&gt; Prison gang white supremacists murdered another inmate for not objecting to having an African American cellmate\n\n&gt; White supremacist inmate killed his African American cellmate\n\nI'm practically picking these at random. Anyone who looks at the incidents in this report can see that the majority of them are like these.\n\nThe thesis of this report basically says that there have been more than twice as many cases of \"right wing extremism\" than \"Islamic extremism\" since 9\/11. They're not calculating this by death toll, for which Islamic extremism is still higher, but rather the number of incidents. Regardless, when someone hears that talking point, they imagine that right wing terrorism must be absolutely rampant in this country. Nevermind the fact that any actual far-right terrorist act would guaranteed be covered by every major news outlet in this country for at least two full days, probably a lot longer now that Trump is in office.  \n\nBut that's not what's going on. What's going on is that there are a lot of gangs in this country, and the vast majority of them are racially homogeneous, particularly those in prison. There are all-white gangs in this country, there are all-black gangs in this country, there are all-Latino gangs in this country. Am I to understand that when someone in an all-white gang murders a rival gang member in prison, that's \"right wing extremism,\" but when a member of the all-black or all-Latino gang murders rival gang member in prison, that's just murder? How does that make any sense? \n\nWouldn't it make just as much (or as little) sense the other way around? If the logic they're using is that the white pride gang member is far more likely to vote Republican than Democrat, couldn't you just as well say that an inner city all-black gang member is far more likely to vote Democrat than Republican? African Americans in general vote Democrat 9 to 1, and I highly doubt that the Republican ten percent falls anywhere in line with the inner city gang member demographic. No one in their right mind would call some drive-by shooting in downtown Chicago \"left wing extremism,\" and rightfully so.\n\nAnd the idea that there's somehow a major difference between the white gangs and the black or Latino gangs in terms of their motivation doesn't really hold water. They're all just street gangs. They're basically all driven by identity and they draw in people for basically the same reasons.\n\nIf it were some white nationalist shooting a Democrat candidate, bombing city hall, or killing somebody due to some clear political motivation, then there would be some logic in calling that a \"right wing extremist\" act. Same thing goes for a black nationalist. But nobody should consider some black nationalist killing their step-dad after an argument \"left wing extremism.\" That's called \"domestic homicide.\"\n\nLikewise, if some racist black guy shoots a bunch of white people because he's racist, does that somehow get grouped in with left wing politics? If the guy had no political motivation for the crime, no motivation at all other than being racist, would we call that \"left-wing extremism?\" Of course not. We'd call that a racist guy shooting a bunch of people. \n\nAnd the ADL report is exactly the same. Here's their list of extremist incidents from 2017.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.adl.org\/resources\/reports\/murder-and-extremism-in-the-united-states-in-2017#the-incidents\n\nMaybe I've miscounted, but I see exactly one actual right wing extremist act here, which is the Charlottesville murder. The rest are clearly and obviously gang-related or domestic homicides, they have nothing to do with politics at all, let alone the American right wing. \n\nThis is just a nasty, manipulative way to lump in every racist asshole in history with conservative politics.\n\nAnd look, I'm not claiming actual right wing terrorism doesn't exist. Obviously there was the Oklahoma City bombing, but that was one incident that happened 23 years ago. If we're looking at this accurately and not just twisting statistics to create some partisan talking point, you have to acknowledge that in today's political climate we're seeing at least as much politically related violence coming from the left. When you look at groups like AntiFa, that is actually politically motivated violence. That's not some guy shooting someone after an argument in front of a diner, or some guy killing people out of sheer racism, that is someone going to a political rally and attacking someone due to political motivations. The Republican office in Wyoming got burned down last month. A Republican candidate was stabbed a few weeks ago. Last year someone shot at Republican congressmen at a ballpark. And yet we hear non-stop about this \"epidemic of right wing terrorism.\" I mean, just Google the words \"right wing terrorism\" and look at the results.
