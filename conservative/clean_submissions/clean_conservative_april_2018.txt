Why does the world seemingly hate Fox News? Reddit wants to see Fox\u2019s building burnt and its leaders imprisoned. Some good friends of mine that are center-left constantly make Fox the butt of jokes, essentially saying it\u2019s biased and thus unreliable. Fox seems to be the only one deserving of the \u201cFake News\u201d label according to the Internet. Obama even made comments that one should not trust Fox News. I don\u2019t understand why.\n\nYes it\u2019s got a right-leaning bias, but I don\u2019t think they try and hide that do they? And even still, they seem to fairly report things regardless of which side it seems to favor.  What\u2019s most baffling of all is why are people so willing to ignore the left-leaning bias of every other news station? \n\nI don\u2019t often watch Fox News and honestly I don\u2019t pay attention to much of the news at all, its just frustrating to see all this hypocrisy and everyone losing their minds over Fox. Every other station has scripts, they all collude, and people (the internet? Reddit?) only care when it\u2019s Fox doing it because that, along with right-wingers, are the \u201cgreatest threat to our democracy,\u201d (someone actually said that in the comments.) \n\nAny explanations for this phenomenon?","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Can we talk about Fox News?"}

As the saying goes (im paraphrasing of course), debate isnt meant to convince your opponent, its to convince your audience. I can't avoid her. i simply cannot. Family gatherings make this impossible. So, in order to convince everyone else how nuts she is, what should i do? What do you guys do?

I believe that American Universities, feel free to chime in from overseas if you see this problem too, have become the exact opposite of what they were intended to be. I believe universities have lost their atmosphere of an intellectually challenging place where you can bring your ideas and be challenged and challenge others and come out of it with a stronger opinion or a changed mind. So I guess my question is in two parts; how can a conservative in a university be accepted in the current belief system in the universities, and how do we get back to an intellectual place that accepts all forms of ideas not just bullying the opposing side out?","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"At what point does the push toward inclusivity actually exclude people?"}

{"author":"JohnSemmens","created_utc":1523059870,"num_comments":2,"score":24,"selftext":"Mexico Threatens to End Cooperation Against Violent Gangs\n\nIrked at the prospect that President Trump may send US troops to guard the border against illegal immigration, the Mexican Senate unanimously passed a resolution that would end the bilateral cooperation between US and Mexican law enforcement agencies against the violent drug cartels that have run rampant along the border.\n\nPresident of the Senate, Pablo Escudero Mora defended the seemingly irrational move as \"totally justified given the long history of US aggression toward our country. First they seized Texas. Then they invaded Mexico and forced us to cede California, and what are now Arizona and New Mexico to them. Now, in an unwarranted effort to prevent migrants who merely seek to settle in what were once Mexican lands, Trump wants to militarize the border. We say enough is enough.\"\n\nEscudero acknowledged that \"these gangs are hurting many Mexicans, but they are also helping to smuggle immigrants across the border. In addition they are bringing in cash from drugs they sell to rich Americans. This helps our economy, which is more than Trump has done for us. While we wish these cartels wouldn't murder so many of our citizens, these gangs are the lesser evil compared to the Devil that is the United States.\"\n\n\"An amusing irony of this whole situation is that policies of the previous US Administration actually augmented the armament of these gangs.\" Escudero chuckled. \"A lot of their weapons were supplied by US covert operatives in the hope that it would spark voter demands for more gun control regulations. So, any atrocities that are committed on Americans by these gangs will be partially self-inflicted. That's got to bring a smile to the face of every Mexican patriot.\"\n\nIn related news, the State of California has issued more than a million driver's licenses to illegal immigrants. The licenses may be used to allow these immigrants to cast ballots in state and local elections. State Attorney General Xavier Becerra hailed the milestone, calling it \"a historic step toward California's eventual independence or reunification with Mexico. We will break free of the chains imposed by the backward regime of Donald Trump and forge a new destiny for the people of our state.\"\n\nDems Split on Tax Cut Repeal\n\nDemocrat Party leadership is not united in its plans for the recently passed tax cut. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) pledged to repeal the cuts, saying that \"the crumbs that Trump and the GOP selfishly tried to withhold from the government will be taken back and amalgamated into a large pool of resources to fund vitally needed government programs.\"\n\nAmong the programs mentioned by Pelosi were \"an expansion of regulations to more effectively monitor behavior so government can guide private individuals toward a more socially conscious lifestyle\" and \"a long overdue increase in salaries for government employees, who are the crucial actors in transforming the country into the progressive society promised by President Obama.\"\n\nDemocratic National Committee Vice Chairman, Rep. Keith Ellison (Minn) disagreed, saying that \"I don't think it would be wise for us to overtly campaign in favor of repealing the tax cuts. Those of us on the inside know that the government can make better use of that money than private individuals can. But I think baldly telling people this like House Minority Leader Pelosi wants to do is foolish. There is a principle in my faith called taqiya that urges dissimulation in the face of one's enemies. We need to convey a more sympathetic attitude toward taxpayers during the campaign. After we win we can start to talk about how we can wrest that money out of their hands.\"\n\nIn related news, the socialist paradise of Venezuela, where food shortages have enabled citizens to achieve weight losses averaging 24 lbs. per person during the last year, saw Minister of Education El\u00edas Jaua chastise \"the enemies of the revolution who are over eating. Everywhere you look you see empty supermarket shelves. How can the government ensure a ready supply of food if people keep eating it? Unlike capitalist countries, our laws entitle our people to have access to food. However, too many anti-social traitors are abusing this right by consuming more than they need.\"\n\nFaceBook Admits \"Invasion of Privacy\"\n\nFacebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, publicly admitted that \"our company's invasion of our clients' privacy probably rates a score of 10 out of 10 for being as complete a betrayal as possible.\" Despite this colossal failure, Sandberg insisted that CEO Mark \"Zuckerberg's public apology ought to be penance enough. Look, we're with the good guys. We allowed President Obama to use our massive data to get reelected in 2012. Obviously, in hindsight, the Cambridge Analytica deal was a mistake.\"\n\n\"In our defense, the amount of data we sold to Cambridge Analytica was tiny compared to what we freely gave to Obama,\" Sandberg explained. \"With all the polls showing Hillary with a commanding lead we thought we could make a buck without damaging her election chances. It turned out we were wrong, but we weren't the only ones. Everybody was sure she would win in a landslide. It isn't fair to make us the scapegoat for the unforeseen outcome of the 2016 election.\"\n\nSandberg insisted \"we are going the extra mile to try to make up for the damage. We already scan the contents of every user's posts and messages looking for anti-social attitudes. For example, we already flag any user posts of articles from Breitbart as 'intentionally misleading.' And we're developing new algorithms that we believe will do a better job of excluding socially unacceptable content from being promulgated through our platform. So far, we've achieved a modicum of success. Pro-Trump messages have been reduced by nearly 50%. But we're not going to say we're satisfied. I think we can get a lot closer to 100% if we keep up our effort.\"\n\nIn the wake of this scandal, a new policy FaceBook is implementing is to charge a fee to subscribers who want to opt out of the company's data-driven exploitation of users' personal information. Sandberg likened this to \"the kind of distinction you see in cable and satellite TV. If you don't want to be hounded by advertisers who know your weaknesses you're going to have to pay for that privilege like you would for HBO or Showtime.\"\n\nAs a prelude to his upcoming Congressional testimony, Zuckerberg has been assiduously deleting his FaceBook files. Unlike other users of the FaceBook platform, Zuckerberg is able to delete copies of those files that appear on any other FaceBook user's page. The CEO said he was \"confident I'll be able to do a more complete job than Secretary Clinton was able to do with her emails. Unlike her, I am not technologically inept. I don't think I'll have to resort to busting up any devices with a hammer.\"\n\nHillary Claims Credit for #MeToo Movement\n\nThis week, former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton claimed credit for accelerating the #MeToo Movement. \"If I hadn't lost the election none of this awakening to the the widespread sexual harassment that has plagued women in this country would have come to light,\" she asserted.\n\n\"Harvey Weinstein\u2014case zero\u2014in the exposure of the sexual harassment epidemic was a great supporter of me and donor to the Democratic Party,\" Clinton pointed out. \"As president, in order to repay his loyalty and generosity to the Party, I would have protected him from the assault on his character launched by the former victims of his lewd behavior, just like I tried to protect Bill from the allegations made by his victims. So, in a way, it could be said that my defeat removed the possibility that I could use the power of the presidency to impede the exposure of Harvey's unsavory history. It's unfair that I don't get proper credit for my role in the movement to attain sexual justice.\"\n\nPutin Complains about Demonization of Stalin\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin denounced what he labeled \"the excessive demonization of former Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. His methods may have been harsh by Western standards, but few can quibble with the results.\" These \"results\" included the deaths of 15 million to 30 million Soviet citizens through executions, labor camps, avoidable famines and making the treaty with Germany that unleashed WW II.\n\n\"Few critics take into account the poverty and backwardness of the country Stalin inherited,\" Putin contended. \"Bringing the Soviet Union into the modern era required sacrifices. The millions who died in the Gulag would have died eventually, regardless. Their labors helped make the Soviet Union into a superpower. We should not discount that accomplishment.\"\n\nPutin even defended Stalin's infamous non-aggression pact with Hitler by pointing out that \"the Western powers were trying to get a pact with Germany, but refused to acquiesce to the partition of Poland. Stalin was less squeamish. As a result we got the alliance and it refocused the Nazi's toward attacking France and England rather than attacking Russia, as Hitler vowed to do in Mein Kampf. This likely saved millions of Soviet lives and also netted us additional territories after the war was over.\"\n\nWhile a recent poll showed only 25% of Russians consider Stalin's repressions justified, Putin pointed out that \"this level of support is higher than most Westerners would have expected\" and predicted that \"as knowledge of Stalin's crimes fades, popular support for his achievements will inevitably grow\u2014like the respect for Islam has now that most have forgotten the massacres carried out in the jihad to spread the faith so many centuries ago.\"\n\nIn related news, Putin claims that the recovery of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal \"proves we are innocent. When we poison an enemy he does not recover. Remember Litvinenko? That's what happens when those who know what they are doing are involved.\"\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: April 8, 2018 Edition"}

{"author":"youngconservative96","created_utc":1523091955,"num_comments":1,"score":1,"selftext":"While I do believe there is room for some gun control I do not believe that more is necessarily effective at preventing crime. One argument towards this idea that I've thought of recently is a comparison between Hawaii and California. \n\nFirst I know Hawaii has somewhat restrictive gun control but not nearly as restrictive as California's. Hawaii is number 6 on the Brady Campaigns list of states with the most gun control while California is number 1 with a 14 point lead. (76-62) Next Hawaii has a higher gun ownership rate than California. How much higher? Over double the amount. (45% to 20%) Now clearly because guns cause crime Hawaii must be a blood bath. Well not at all. Maybe it's the scenic vistas or the fresh air but Hawaii has a incredibly low amount of homicide compared to California. Hawaii sees a homicide rate of 2.8 per 100,000 while California enjoys a homicide rate of 5.3 per 100,000. A little strange to see this based off of \"common sense\" about guns but these are the numbers. Still there are other factors to consider.\n\nThe most common factor i see brought up as a rebuttal is population density. More people packed together would clearly mean more crime correct? Well not necessarily. Hawaii indeed does have a lower population density than California. With California having slightly denser population at 254 people per square mile while Hawaii sits at a pitiful 222. But is this gap enough to justify a 3 point gap in homicides between the states. I don't believe so certainly not when New York, another state with less gun control than California, a population density of 421 people per square mile and a homicide rate of 3.6 per 100,000.\n\nThere are many other factors to consider and I would enjoy seeing them added to and discussed  in the comments. This was just a very basic argument I've been thinking about the past day or two and I think it does well to point out the fact that more gun control doesn't equal less crime and that more guns does not mean more crime. Clearly things like location, culture, and demographics seem to play much more of a role in Homicide in general rather than gun laws and ownership.\n\nSources: \nBrady Scores:   http://crimadvisor.com/data/Brady-State-Scorecard-2015.pdf\n\nGun Ownership Rate by State: http://www.businessinsider.com/gun-ownership-by-state-2015-7\n\nHomicide by State: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/homicide_mortality/homicide.htm\n\nPopulation Density by State:\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/183588/population-density-in-the-federal-states-of-the-us/\n\n\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Small thought about gun control (California vs Hawaii)"}

Yet there's a whole group of people that claim cops are collectively racist without showing any proof. And if you call them out, somehow *you're* the bigot who can't understand what it's like to live in a society with police officers as a black person. /r/BlackPeopleTwitter has been posting these themes constantly as of late and there's currently a very popular post that is of a tweet from Janae Small who claims the police are killing blacks because they can \"get away\" with it. Apparently the police are murdering black people out the wazoo simply because they're black [citation needed].\n\nThe Washington Post has a constantly updating database of fatal police shootings since 2015.\n\n[Link for year 2015](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings/)\n\n[Link for year 2016](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2016/)\n\n[Link for year 2017](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2017/)\n\n[Link for year 2018](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/police-shootings-2018/?utm_term=.ed1e9dcdaa08)\n\n2018 is still underway, and I suspect some shootings from 2017 are still under investigation/trial so for this post I chose year 2016. If you think that's cherry picking data for a given year, I invite anyone to dig into all the other years. In 2016, the police fatally shot 963 people. Of those 963, 233 were black. You'd think this alone would dispel the narrative suggesting the police are rampantly killing blacks for no reason, but I digress. Of the 233 black victims, the majority of them were armed with a gun (145), knife (21), and so on. But hey! 18 individuals were unarmed and still shot by police. I guess those 18 killed individuals must be the proof of this country-wide racist cops. After all, people like to point out how [blacks are twice as likely to be unarmed when fatally shot by police than whites.](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/afr-americans-fatally-shot-less-likely-be-armed-whites-n718666). So let\u2019s take a closer look at these unarmed individuals that were shot and killed. \n\n[#1 Christopher Sowell: Police responded to a call after Sowell seriously injured 5 people including his kids.](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Man-Who-Went-on-Stabbing-Spree-in-Cobbs-Creek-Identified-395310871.html) \n\n[According to the police commissioner, Sowell was instructed to take his hands out of his pockets several times. Sowell eventually did so \u201cabruptly\u201d with an unknown item which was assumed to be a firearm that turned out to be a cellphone. According to the neighbor, the police were justified in shooting Sowell.](http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20160930__Running_from_his_own_demons___Was_drug_use_behind_man_s_violent_rampage_.html) \n\n&gt;WaPo\u2019s Take: Christopher Sowell, an unarmed 32-year-old black man, was shot on Sept. 28, 2016, in Philadelphia, Pa. **Sowell allegedly stabbed two boys, choked his daughter and attacked two family friends,** according to Philadelphia police. Sowell was killed, police said, when he came out of a residence and abruptly pulled his hands from his pockets.\n\nVerdict: justified shooting\n\n[#2 Alfred Olango: Video evidence shows Alfred suddenly pull a shiny object from his front pocket and aim it at the police officer responding to the 911 call regarding erratic behavior. **A witness also confirms the object looked gun based and that the police officer had every right to shoot or be killed.** Thus the DA did not prosecute as the shooting was justified.](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/courts/sd-me-olango-ruling-20170109-story,amp.html) \n\n&gt;WaPo\u2019s Take: Alfred Olango, an unarmed 38-year-old black man, was shot on Sept. 27, 2016, in El Cajon, Calif. El Cajon police were called to investigate reports of a man behaving erratically. Police said that when officers arrived, Olango pulled an object out of his pocket and assumed a \"shooting stance.\" The object turned out to be a silver vape smoking device. Olango's sister told authorities that he had a mental illness.\n\nVerdict: justified shooting\n\n[#3 Terence Crutcher: Police received a 911 call for an abandoned vehicle. Officer Shelby shot Terence who later died in the hospital which started a criminal investigation. Officer Shelby\u2019s attorney claimed the victim may be under the influence of PCP based on her drug-recognition training. Per the autopsy reports, Terence had PCP intoxication and that TCP was also present. **Officer Shelby was charged with first-degree manslaughter and found not guilty by a jury.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Terence_Crutcher) \n\n&gt;WaPo\u2019s Take: Terence Crutcher, an unarmed 40-year-old black man, was shocked with a stun gun and shot on Sept. 16, 2016, on a street in Tulsa, Okla. Tulsa police video showed Crutcher with his hands up walking away from officers and toward his SUV that was stopped in the roadway. Two officers fired as Crutcher reached the driver's door. Police said he refused orders. The U.S. Justice Department opened an investigation.\n\nVerdict: Video shows the Crutcher slowly walking towards his vehicle with his hands up and not complying with police orders.

Authorities said they were searching a residence as part of a drug investigation involving Riggins. An officer with the Hillsborough County SWAT Team shot Riggins after they entered the home.\n\nVerdict: Justified shooting\n\n[#5 Donnell Thompson: On the early morning of July 28, Robert Alexander used a gun to carjack a Honda Civic. While working to identify Alexander, the sheriffs received a 911 call just a few blocks away for a man lying motionless in the front yard. That man was Donnell Thompson who also matched the description of the carjacking suspect. Thompson did not respond to commands to show hands, stand or put his hands behind his head and remained unresponsive until a form bullet hit and then bolted towards an armored vehicle. The deputy shot Thompson for concern he may run into the neighborhood to cause harm.](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-sheriff-shooting-20160809-snap-story.html). [The County then agreed to pay $1.49 million to the family of Thompson.](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-thompson-shooting-settlement-20170906-story.html) \n\n&gt;WaPo\u2019s Take: Donnell Thompson, an unarmed 27-year-old black man, was shot on July 28, 2016, in a yard in Compton, Calif. He was a carjacking suspect and fled from Los Angeles sheriff's deputies. Shots were fired at the deputies during the pursuit. When they stopped Thompson, he and a passenger fled on foot. He charged at deputies in a yard.\n\nVerdict: Mistake by the police which was settled by the County. \n\n[#6 Dalvin Hollins: Police responded to a **911 call from a Walgreens employee who called 911 and claimed Hollins was armed. During a foot pursuit, Hollins allegedly turned his head to the officer and extend his right hand toward the officer who thought was a gun.** The victim was shot in the back, however the officer was not prosecuted.](http://www.12news.com/news/local/valley/was-the-tempe-police-shooting-of-dalvin-hollins-justified/434775617) \n\n&gt;WaPo\u2019s take: Dalvin Hollins, an unarmed 19-year-old black man, was shot on July 27, 2016, on a street in Tempe, Ariz. Tempe police answered a call about an armed robbery at a Walgreens. A man matching the description ran from an officer, who chased him and shot Hollina during a scuffle. Hollins family told police he had been struggling with mental illness.\n\nVerdict: Justified shooting which was not prosecuted.\n\n[#7 Deravis Caine Rogers: An Atlanta police officer responded to an off-duty officer reporting a suspicious person. Despite not knowing the details of the suspect, Burns fired a shot into the vehicle Rogers was in which killed him. **The officer was fired and indicted for using excessive force**](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3767967/White-Atlanta-cop-indicted-shooting-death-22-year-old-Deravis-Caine-Rogers.html) \n\n&gt;WaPo\u2019s take: Deravis Caine Rogers, an unarmed 22-year-old black man, was shot on June 22, 2016, in Atlanta, Ga.

Officers signaled the car to stop but the driver Shumpert did not. Shumpert traveled several blocks before stopping, and fled on foot. An altercation between Shumpert and officer Cook followed which resulted in Cook using lethal force after officers including Cook attempted to defuse the situation using non-lethal force. Following a comprehensive and independent review which included witness interviews, autopsy, crime-scene reports, photographs, surveillance video, police radio traffic, incident reports, interview with the medical examiner and the interview with the officer, the Justice Department determined there is insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that officer Tyler Cook violated the civil rights laws.](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndms/pr/federal-officials-close-review-fatal-shooting-antwun-shumpert) \n\n&gt;WaPo\u2019s take: Antwun Shumpert, an unarmed 37-year-old black man, was shot on June 18, 2016, in Tupelo, Miss.

Officer Freeman commanded Jospeh several times to stop and don\u2019t move before firing.](http://www.mystatesman.com/news/officer-who-shot-naked-unarmed-teen-david-joseph-defended-myself/2flO5QlJkjXpyDrRBIbJ2H/) [The city of Austin fired officer Freeman and settled with the family.](http://www.statesman.com/news/city-austin-settles-with-officer-fired-for-shooting-naked-teen/cChTxJUbby7RxMHDHnQ2JJ/) \n\n&gt;WaPo\u2019s take: David Joseph, an unarmed 17-year-old black male, was shot on Feb. 8, 2016, in Austin, Tex. Austin police were responding to reports of an erratic, aggressive person. Joseph, who was naked, rushed toward the officer.\n\nVerdict: excessive force per city of Austin\n\n[#18 Antronie Scott: Officer Lee fatally shot Scott while attempting to arrest him on two felony warrants.](http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/SAPD-officer-files-complaint-against-McManus-6871520.php) [Officer Lee almost immediately fired his service weapon because Scott spun around quickly and the officer feared for his life](http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/SAPD-officer-files-complaint-against-McManus-6871520.php) \n\n&gt;WaPo\u2019s take: Antronie Scott, an unarmed 36-year-old black man, was shot on Feb. 4, 2016, in San Antonio, Tex. Undercover San Antonio police officers were monitoring Scott, who had outstanding arrest warrants. When a uniformed officer approached Scott, he spun around with something in his hand. Police later determined that Scott was holding a cellphone.\n\nVerdict: Probably excessive force.\n\nSo to review we have 18 instances where a police officer fatally shot an unarmed black individual. Most of these shootings were justified as determined by evidence/witness testimony/no charges being made. Are police in the US collectively racist because of one black man who was wrongfully shot due to matching the description of another suspect and the County settled the matter with the family? Are the police in the US collectively racist because the police officer was fired and indicted for using excessive force? Are the police in the US collectively racist because one officer shot a suspect charging at him while being repeatedly told to stop and the city settled with the family? Where is this country-wide level of racist cops killing black people for no reason? The majority of these cases involve the police responding to a 911 call with a suspected crime being committed by the victim. When you accuse an entire group of people of some ulterior motive they do not have, you have our current racial tension in the country.

{"author":"dcman00000","created_utc":1523275949,"num_comments":1,"score":3,"selftext":"#INTRO\n\n\nThe Idea of this post is to lay bare many of the myths surrounding free market healthcare, and to give a factual and persuasive counter argument to the alternatives promoted.  Fallacies abound throughout many discussions on healthcare and as one is being argued against in the real world, yet more are springing forth in the fertile minds of imperfect human beings. I hope to bring a desperately needed and unfortunately rare counter argument to single payer systems or government sponsored systems. Although I endeavored to cover as many topics as possible, there are doubtless multitudes of others worthy of debate, and I encourage additional support or rebuttal in the comments section.\n\nI believe that the U.S healthcare system is factually superior to alternatives and would benefit from *more* free market reform. \n\n\nFirst we must ask ourselves, how do we measure success in healthcare? By cost? Life expectancy? Survival rates? Access to care? Number of healthcare workers and devices (eg: MRI's)? By research and innovation? Attractiveness for entry of new healthcare workers? To say nothing of immeasurables like patient choice, comfort, responsive bureaucracy, and Tort vs No fault systems. What about healthcare simply as a right? What about profit? We will cover these all as much as possible given the format.\n\nAnd so we begin\n\n\n-----\n\n\n# Operational Definitions\n\n\n[Operational definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_definition#Academic_discipline) are often used in the sciences as a part of the scientific method. It clarifies variables and often makes them testable, and is especially useful when qualitative data is used. Here we will define *Free Market Healthcare* along with *Single Payer Healthcare*. \n\n* Free Market Healthcare: In a system of free-market healthcare, prices for healthcare goods and services are set freely by agreement between patients and health care providers, and the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government, price-setting monopoly, or other authority. Taken from [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market_healthcare)\n\n* Single Payer Healthcare: Single-payer healthcare is a healthcare system financed by taxes that covers the costs of essential healthcare for all residents, with costs covered by a single public system. Taken from [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer_healthcare)\n\n**Note:** There are different versions of each type of healthcare in the definitions provided above, about which you can read [Here](http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/health_care_systems_four_basic_models.php). I believe that I have narrowed down the definitions to their essential differences, namely the difference between free market competitive forces without government intervention on the one hand and monopsonistic practices on the part of government on the other hand. \n\nSo, how do we measure success in either system? What follows is a list of possible ways to measure the success of each system. \n\n-----\n\n# Cost\n\nMany of you may already be privy to [the](http://www.oecd.org/health/healthspendingcontinuestooutpaceeconomicgrowthinmostoecdcountries.htm) fact that the United States spends far more per capita on healthcare than every other nation in the OECD. The first thing we must note (from the article just linked) is that healthcare spending is increasing faster than economic growth *across the entire OECD*. This fact means that over time healthcare spending will constitute an ever growing share of industrialized economies, whether or not they have free market healthcare or single payer systems. The [OECD](http://www.oecd.org/health/healthcarecostsunsustainableinadvancedeconomieswithoutreform.htm) points to the following as the culprit:\n\n&gt;  Upward pressure on health spending comes from new technology in medical services, rising incomes driving higher expectations, and the growing needs of ageing populations.\n\nFurthermore, we must not confuse *prices* with *costs*. In an economic sense, prices are those points at which things like money are exchanged, and costs are those things that may have been produced as alternatives to production of one good or service over another. I speak of course of the difference between [Prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price) and [*opportunity costs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost). Remember that opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs: the real cost of output forgone, lost time, pleasure or any other benefit that provides utility should also be considered an opportunity cost. We must not confuse these two terms, for they are two entirely different things as we will see. \n\nAlthough the United States pays a higher *Price* per capita, it is not at all clear or a forgone conclusion that its *costs* are higher. Indeed, many single payer systems have non-price related costs that are higher than in the United States. A prime example of this is higher wait [times](https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/high-priced-pain-what-expect-single-payer-health-caresystem) even for [medically necessary services](http://freebeacon.com/issues/waiting-times-for-canadas-single-payer-health-care-system-hit-record-high/). This is a forgone conclusion because the *costs* of a good or service cannot be side stepped or controlled like *prices* can be.\n\nThis segues into rationing. In a free market system goods and services are rationed by the price system. When the price system no longer functions properly, as is the case through government monopsonistic practices, price ceilings and floors, and other interventions, then other forms of rationing become prevelant. [Other](http://webnt.calhoun.edu/distance/internet/business/eco231/downloads/lnc4.pdf) types of rationing include waiting lines, grants of official permission, tie-in sales, political power, and personal characteristics. These other kinds of costs are hard to quantify, and usually do NOT show up in statistics that allegedly give a full accounting of the cost of healthcare. \n\nThe single payer system also has other hidden costs. A monopoly is when there is one seller and many buyers, a monopsony is when there is one buyer and many sellers (Hence \"single payer\"). Being that a single payer system is a monopsony, it incurs costs on the economy commensurate with its market structure. The [welfare and deadweight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopsony#Welfare_implications) costs on an economy are difficult to account for, but are very real costs imposed on an economy through this type of market structure. \n\n[There](http://ushealthpolicygateway.com/vii-key-policy-issues-regulation-and-reform/p-health-reform/national-health-reform/single-payer/#What_Are_the_Deadweight_Losses_Associated_with_Single_Payer) have been attempts at accounting for deadweight loss in the U.S economy from adopting the Bernie Sanders \"Medicare for all plan\". \n\n&gt;Conover (2017) estimates the deadweight losses from the additional new taxes required by the Sanders Medicare-for-All plan would range from $625 billion to $1.1 trillion.\n\nSo we see that, at the very least, we cannot rely on the price to assess the success of healthcare primarily because the much lower *prices* of single payer healthcare conceal tremendous *costs* on individuals and the economy. \n\n\n-----\n\n\n# Life Expectancy\n\nIf you take a look and [compare](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:CAN:USA:DEU:GBR:ESP:FRA:DNK:JPN&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false) life expectancy in the U.S vs other industrialized nations it indeed shows the U.S slightly below that of other comparable countries. Leaving aside the fact that a supposedly far inferior system in the U.S performs just about as well in life expectancy as single payer systems, we have on major problem with relying on this statistic. Namely, socioeconomic differences, especially in the United States. \n\nA [quick](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/life-expectancy-by-re/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) glance at the information on life expectancy shows wide variations by race, ethnicity, and region. Asian Americans lead the overall pack at (86.5), Latino(82.8), Whites (78.9), Native Americans (76.9), and African Americans(74.6). This does not correlate well with wealth or income considering Latinos are the poorest overall [households](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2017/09/11/median-wealth-of-black-and-latino-families-could-hit-zero-before-the-centurys-end/) in the United States. This strongly implies that there is little to no correlation between wealth and life expectancy in the United States. \n\n&gt; middle quintile White households have nearly 8 times as much wealth as median Black households and 10 times as much as Latino households.\n\nThis is, ostensibly, with an inferior healthcare system. If we use Latinos and Asians, who can be said to both suffer from discrimination and also cannot be more different in terms of education and wealth, then they would be among the healthiest citizens in the world, with U.S asians having a modest lead as the healthiest people on the [planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy). Again, I bring this up to dispel the notion that single payer systems produce better results in terms of life expectancy. The truth is that given the right circumstances, as is the case for the Asian population residing in the U.S, The free market system performs wonderfully. \n\n\nSo why the difference? \n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/huge-racial-gap-in-life-expectancy-2014-1\n\n\n\n&gt; In a 2013 report, the CDC investigated persistent causes for the racial gap in life expectancy in more detail.\"Higher death rates due to heart disease, cancer, homicide, diabetes, and perinatal conditions\" accounted for 60 percent of the gap, the report noted. The report goes on to say that the gap would have been even larger \"if not for the lower death rates for the black population for suicide, unintentional injuries, and chronic lower respiratory diseases.\"\n\n\nAnd conclude the following\n\n&gt;  improving educational opportunities may be a key part of making health disparities a thing of the past.\n\n\nIn other words, differences in the ways that people take care of themselves as relates to their health and different lifestyle choices impacted these considerable differences. \n\nIts a stretch to say that lifestyle choices are the result of either single payer or free market healthcare. More likely its a cultural issue, which is beyond the discussion being had here. \n\n\nSo again we see that life expectancy in the aggregate may be a poor indicator of the success of a healthcare system. In the United States we have the one of the healthiest populations on the planet, and that is with a *free market system*. \n\n\n------\n\n\n# Survival Rates\n\nIts true the that [United States](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/mortality-rates-u-s-compare-countries/#item-u-s-relatively-high-mortality-rate-diseases-circulatory-system) has a higher than **average** age adjusted mortality rate for *most* causes of death, but this does not mean that it is absolutely the worst. \n\nNote: As an aside the U.S actually has a *lower* than average age adjusted mortality rate when it comes to cancer.\n\nThe U.S, although above average in for example circulatory diseases, does better than some other countries with single payer systems such as Austria, Germany, and Sweden. \n\nI won't belabor every point in the article I just cited, you could and should at least glance at it for yourself, but the point of *this* section is that survival rates vary across and within countries, and between socioeconomic and ethnic/racial groups. \n\n\n\n----\n\n\n# Access\n\nFirst, a claim made by former President Obama:\n\n&gt; \"There are \u201c46 million uninsured Americans\u201d in May 2009.\"\n\nSo let us start with this number. This implies that the rest of America has access to healthcare (roughly 260 million people as of 2009). \n\nThe Census Bureau put the number at 45,657,000 in 2009. So any claim much higher than this is *probably* false. \n\n9.7 million of that number are not citizens of the United States (this has to do with immigration, which is beyond our discussion)\n\nMore than 17 million of the uninsured make at least $50,000 per year (the median household income of $50,233) \u2013 8.4 million make $50,000 to $74,999 per year and 9.1 million make $75,000 or higher. Two economists working at the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that 25 to 75 percent of those who do not purchase health insurance coverage \u201ccould afford to do so.\u201d\n\n The NationalCenter for Policy Analysis estimates that uninsured people get about $1,500 of free health care per year, or $6,000 per family of four.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office says that 45 percent of the uninsured will be insured within four months. CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin also said that the frequent claim of 40+ million Americans lacking insurance is an \u201cincomplete and potentially misleading picture of the uninsured population.\u201d\n\nCBO analysis found that 36 million people would remain uninsured even if the Senate\u2019s $1.6 trillion health care plan is passed.\n\n\nhttps://www.mrc.org/articles/fact-sheet-americas-uninsured\n\nhttp://www.enttoday.org/article/a-myth-of-modern-medicine-there-are-40-million-americans-with-no-access-to-health-care/\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111651742\n\nThe real number of people who \n\n1.

Do not qualify under some other government program\n\n\nIs actually closer to 12 million people, or about 3.9% of the population as of 2009\n\nIn other words 96.1% of the population is covered or foregoes insurance even though they can afford it or qualify for assistance.\n\nThis is hardly a statistic to get up in arms about. \n\nFurthermore there is great variations between the states and how they run their respective systems, the characteristics of their economies, and the characteristics of their populaces that lead to wide differences in the total number of uninsured within the (https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Uninsured%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D)\n\nThis means that *how a healthcare system is run* and its *economy* and the *characteristics of the populace involved* impact uninsured rates. Remember, uninsured doesn't automatically mean \"cannot afford\" or \"will not have healthcare soon\". \n\nAccess to care statistics rarely incorporate all of these facts, and as such we cannot automatically assume that the United States is *substantially* lower on account of access to care than other comparable countries. \n\n----\n\n\n# Number of healthcare workers, MRI's, Cat scanners, etc\n\nThe U.S has the [Second](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282401/density-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-units-by-country/) highest per capita rate of MRI's in the world, [Third](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266539/distribution-of-equipment-for-computer-tomography/) in the world in Cat scanners, And [Well](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.NUMW.P3?locations=US-XD) above the high income countries average in terms of number of nurses and midwives per capita. \n\nSo we've essentially established that the supply of healthcare workers and devices is relatively high in the United States. This is with a free market healthcare system. \n\n\n----\n\n\n# Research and innovation\n\n\nThe U.S produces by far the most new medical [patents](https://www.americanactionforum.org/weekly-checkup/new-drug-patents-country/) than any other country, and its statistics in this measure may actually be underrepresented because of American corporations relocating their headquarters to other countries in order to take advantage of the lower corporate tax rates there. \n\nA study found [that](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2866602/)\n\n&gt; The United States ... was responsible for the development of 43.7% of the NMEs. The United Kingdom, Switzerland, and a few other countries innovated proportionally more than their contribution to GDP or prescription drug spending\n\n\nSo again here we see that the United States far and away leads the world in medical innovation. If a free market system were inferior, it would be hard to see how this would be the case. \n\n\n-----\n\n\n# Unmeasureables\n\nThese are harder to take into account by virtue of the fact that they are hard to quantify. \n\nHowever we may, at the very least, list some of the differences between the U.S and other nations.\n\n\"Tort vs No Fault\" [countries](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2003/olrdata/ins/rpt/2003-R-0885.htm). \n\n&gt;Several medical no-fault systems in medicine operate internationally. Collectively, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and New Zealand have accumulated nearly 80 years of experience in operating administrative systems that replace medical malpractice litigation. Medical no-fault schemes were introduced in New Zealand in 1974, and in Sweden in 1975.\n\n\nOut of 5 countries surveyed on patient comfort, it was a single payer system that finished in [https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.20.3.244], edging out the United States.\n\n ------\n\n\n# What about profit?\n\nIs profit simply extra money paid on top of the base cost of a good or service? Would we be better off on a system that eliminated profit from the healthcare system altogether? \n\n\nFirst, we must understand what profits do, and where they come from. \n\n\nPrices convey a tremendous amount of [information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPy-QKXofQs) without each person having to have a near infinite knowledge on the instantaneously and continuously changing economy in order to produce the right amount of goods and services, at the right time, and at the right place. \n\nProfits are merely a subset of prices, and act much in the same way. Profits tell suppliers of goods and services, where to produce, what to produce, and how to produce it. This is an incredibly efficient way of allocating and distributing resources, at least compared to other known [methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem). \n\n\nThis gets into [Trade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0gGyeA-8C4) theory.What we can distill this down to is that profit doesn't equate to higher prices, especially in competitive markets where trade is freely allowed. In general economic actors wouldn't trade Goods and services unless they generally thought they were going to be better off afterwards than before. \n\n\nyou can read a little bit more about [Profits here.](https://www.tutor2u.net/economics/reference/functions-of-profit) \n\n\n-----\n\n\n# healthcare as a right?\n\n\nThe U.N universal declaration of human rights says the [following](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)\n\n&gt; Article 25. (1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the **health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care** and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.\n\n\n\nThe [Soviet Constitution of 1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_Soviet_Constitution#Constitutional_rights) Said the following: \n\n&gt; the Constitution also granted social and economic rights not provided by constitutions in some capitalist countries. Among these were the rights to work, rest and leisure, **health protection**, care in old age and sickness, housing, education, and cultural benefits\n\n\nWe must define two terms first, then move on.\n\nPositive rights: \n\n&gt;the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service...while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right (Narveson 2001)\n\n\nNegative Rights: \n\n&gt; The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference...A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right\n\n\n\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/#2.1\n\n\n\nThe problem with positive rights that...\n\n&gt; Negative rights can be respected simply by each person refraining from interfering with each other, while it may be difficult or even impossible to fulfill everyone's positive rights if the sum of people's claims outstrips the resources available.\n\n\nIn most cases, both negative and positive rights are normative in principle, and as such have no relation to underlying dynamics like a system of economics. What I mean by this is that since positive rights, like a right to healthcare, Have to contend with underlying dynamics of supply, demand, market structure, deadweight loss, welfare costs, and many of the other problems we have discussed thus far. A positive right is therefore constrained by the conditions of dynamic systems upon which the right is to be extracted. Furthermore, positive rights often require a duty on a second or third party, which tramples on their negative rights. \n\nA negative right, like a right to free speech, is not constrained by an underlying dynamic So long as you are free from coercion. In addition to that negative rights like free speech do not trample on the rights of others, it requires no duties on other agents. \n\n\nSo can healthcare *truly* be an affirmative right as a workable theory? I say no, because it is often unworkable from its own constraints and also requires duties on others which interferes with their negative rights.\n\nCountries that have declared healthcare as a right in the form of universal coverage via single payer systems have trampled on the negative rights of others, and are unworkable so in far as they are constrained by underlying dynamics...which in this case means economics. \n\n\n\n-----\n\n# Proposed reforms to U.S healthcare\n\n\nSo you must be wondering, do I think the U.S healthcare system is perfect? Absolutely not. It could use for some major reform in the direction of more free markets.\n\nhere are some proposed solutions\n\n* Allow importation of drugs and medical services/devices (huge Deal)\n* Allow competition across state lines for health insurance (Huge deal)\n* End the practice where local hospitals can veto the establishment of new hospitals ( Called Certificates of public need)\n* reduce or streamline the licensing requirements for certain healthcare practitioners\n* End all taxes on medicine and healthcare\n* Change from allowing companies to have 20 year monopolies after a drug is designed to instead have a bounty system allowing generics and name brand competitors to compete right away.\n* reduce the threshold for over the counter drugs\n* Increase immigration for healthcare workers and doctors especially\n* Allow for tax privileged health savings accounts that can be used for yourself or family members (can be invested in equities).\n* Get rid of all price caps and price controls so that the *long term* supply equilibrium is met, stabilizing costs. \n* implement policies that increase full employment so that people can more likely afford healthcare through policies like eliminating the corporate tax, reducing income taxes, and getting rid of capital gains taxes and estate taxes.\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\n\nI believe when compared to single payer systems, free market healthcare is clearly superior. I believe this because Prices and costs are not the same thing, and costs and deadweight loss are hidden in single payer systems. I believe this because Life expectancy for certain groups in the United States are among the highest in the world. I believe this because Survival rates for most diseases are adequate, and the worst performers are single payer systems. I believe this because Access to care in the United States is very very high. I believe this because the number of healthcare workers in the U.S and the supply of advanced medical devices is among the highest in the world. I believe this because The U.S is the worlds leading medical innovator. I believe this because the U.S has tort laws that allow patients to sue for compensation for damages. I believe this because the profit system is indispensable in its function in the economy, and its ability to allocate resources is unmatched. And finally I believe this because I do not believe, unfashionable as it may sound, that healthcare can in *actuality* be a right.

The thing is, the friend group that I am in at school is almost entirely Liberal. I've sat with them at lunch almost every day this school year, and things have been going great - until today. Someone at my table brought up the topic of gender equality, and how people like me are super ignorant to the fact that women can do anything men can (this IS a view that I support). The conversation evolved into the topic of gender roles, and I shared that I think some (although very few) gender roles should be upheld in society. I backed up my claim with the fact that the world has been run this way for thousands of years and the fact that men and women were biologically created differently with different strengths and weaknesses that suit their basic function in society. After saying this, a girl (who is lesbian and a strong feminist), stared into my eyes like she was staring straight at Satan himself. She asked me if I was joking or not, and I told her I wasn't. Then, her girlfriend who also sits with us starts telling me that I am very stupid and should \"stop being so sexist\". I tell her that I'm not a sexist, just a person who knows facts. The whole table tells me to shut up. From then on, whenever I tried to say a word about anything they interrupted me, not letting me get a single word in. I've known these people for a very long time now, and they are really good friends of mine. What should I do?","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"My Liberal friends hate my political views, what should I do?"}

Whoever leads this movement failed to realize that perhaps there could be a few reasons to explain the statistic. \n     A point this ad made was that women have to pay more for a white t-shirt.  What needs to be pointed out is that women\u2019s shirts require different design than men. Women\u2019s shirts need more space in the chest, while men\u2019s shirts are typically straight all the way down. It takes less skill to make men\u2019s shirts, which as you know, the more skill based the labor is, the more it costs. Therefore, their shirts are more expensive. \n     The ad fails to mention makeup as a cost women are willing to pay. Women (typically) like to make themselves look prettier with makeup. Admittedly, makeup isn\u2019t cheap, but if women are willing to pay the price for it, and have been paying the price for it, there should be no reason that something is being said now. \n   Conclusively, this commercial uses a flat statistic without any consideration put into the reasoning behind it just to demonize businesses. Rest assured, prices are probably as low as the companies can make them due to free market competition .\n ","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"My thoughts on AxThePinkTax"}

I'm hoping it gets repealed soon. It violates the 4th Amendment by making it so the government knows what weapons you have (stored in a federal registry).  \n* Hughes Amendment: An addition to the Gun Control act of 1968. Bans civilians from getting newer automatic firearms, such as machine guns (which can be used for defensive purposes, just like any weapon). Violates 2nd Amendment by restricting automatic weapons to military personnel, thus resulting in civilians being defenseless against machine gun-wielding criminals/gangs.   \n* The DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act): It actually goes TOO far (with respect to normal copyright laws), and even infringes on our free speech rights, as we found out with the so-called AACS Encryption Key controversy (you know, the number that starts with 09 F9). It also seems to result in the exact opposite of what they wanted. For example, every time a software piracy site is taken down, using the DMCA Takedown system, at least 2 more pop up to replace it, so it's not effective enough.  \n* Substance bans: They're basically remnants of the 19th-20th century Prohibition laws. Nothing should be banned, except for things that violate the 10 Commandments (i.e. stealing, murder, rape, human trafficking, etc. should stay illegal). Every time something is banned, it just makes people want it more. Look at Portugal. After they decriminalized all drugs, heroin overdose rates actually *dropped*. We need to do the same. It would really cripple the illegal trade market.  \n* The 1986 Full Auto Ban 18 USC \u00a7 922(o): It needs to be repealed RIGHT NOW! It has already resulted in the unnecessary imprisonment of a law-abiding gun owner (David Olofson), just because his semi-automatic malfunctioned. Ridiculous, isn't it? Who on Earth came up with this law, anyway?  \n  \nWhat's keeping them from repealing these laws, anyway? They don't work too well. If you know of any other unconstitutional laws, I would be happy to see why they're unconstitutional, and what it would take to get them repealed.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"List any unconstitutional laws you know of, and explain why they're unconstitutional."}

{"author":"Buckley33","created_utc":1523930053,"num_comments":38,"score":42,"selftext":"Regardless of your opinion of the Starbucks fiasco regarding two black men being removed from a store over loitering (or racism as some charge), the incident provides a good example of self-regulation in the Free Market. \n\nAs Conservatives, most of us would agree that private business owners/corporations should be allowed to run their company as they choose (irregardless of discrimination in any aspect of the business) and reap the consequences accordingly. Unfortunately Titles II and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 gave the government the power to regulate private businesses over discrimination in the workplace, in hiring, and in services rendered to the public. \n\nOften the Left purports that without such government protections we\u2019d being going right back to 1950s Jim Crow South (despite Jim Crow laws forcing* businesses to segregate). And perhaps, in the past, this might have been more true. \n\nHowever, in the modern era things are much different. With the advent of Social Media, instant messaging, and easily accessible/digitized stock markets, boycotting and protesting perceived injustices and issues with companies has never been easier. \n\nThe Starbucks boycott shows how in today\u2019s world just how easily and effectively the Free Market self-regulates (even over minor issues, in my opinion). In mere hours a hashtag campaign can cost thousands of dollars (if not much more) to a company - much more so with Public Relations and credibility. All of this happens without government, and much faster, mind you, had it happened with it. In the case of Starbucks, they are facing a corporate firestorm which not only hurts their stock but also their public standing and businesses. Already they are ramping up efforts to calm the Left over its concerns. This was just two black men being kicked out of a store. Imagine something much worse - and you\u2019ll see a much worse reaction. \n\nIn addition to this, it\u2019s arguable that even smaller/more local businesses could likewise be affected by these types of situations - that\u2019s the power of a digitally connected world. \n\nUltimately the Free Market only sees the color green, and in the end, people should be free to do what they please with their businesses, and on occasion, get burned. And in this day and age businesses are more accountable to the Public than ever. Thanks Leftists for giving Conservatives a beautiful example of Capitalism.\n\nJust thought I would share my thoughts. ~ Buckley33","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The Starbucks Boycott Shows that the Free Market Can Self-Regulate"}

But I'm going to make it one. \n\nEarly Wednesday morning, Erin Popovich, Gregg Popovich's wife, passed away to an ongoing illness she had been dealing with. Gregg Popovich is the Head Coach for the San Antonio Spurs National Basketball Team and he has, many times, shown that he does not like Trump one bit.\n\nAs a Conservative and a massive Trump supporter, I nor anyone else fancied the comments that the Spurs head coach made about our President in the least bit. A few Conservative accounts on Instagram that I follow ended up showing hate because of Gregg's opinions and stance on Trump and I absolutely couldn't stand to read what I was reading. However, it got me thinking. We see all the hate that the Liberal Left sends our way with everything we believe in, but at the same time, how are we so different? We are all entitled to our opinions and our values and our ways of life, just as they are. Sure, we may not agree with it and vice versa. In reference to all the hate I saw towards Gregg after the comments he made, made me realize, that Gregg is no different a human being than we are all because he has opinions that we may not agree with.\n\nWe will all experience the death of a loved one sometime in our lives. We will all grieve for however long it takes to learn to cope with it. We are all still humans who, the only difference we make each other out to be is the ideas and opinions we have. \n\nI am a major NBA fan. My favorite team is the Pelicans, mainly because I was born outside of New Orleans in Metairie, and currently live right outside of Baton Rouge. The Pelicans are in the same division as the Spurs so we see have that division rivalry. I've been to San Antonio and I absolutely love the city. Basketball is all they got, and currently their head coach is suffering and grieving over the loss of his life long partner.\n\nPlease, if you still have any grudges you hold against this man, just because of the beliefs; hold them back and wish him good fortune and send him and his family your prayers. He is currently trying to focus on winning games against the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Playoffs suffering from an 0-2 deficit, along with, now, grieving over the death of his wife.\n\nGod Bless Mrs. Popovich. Rest in Peace...\n\nLINK TO ESPN ARTICLE:\nhttp://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23236973/erin-popovich-wife-san-antonio-spurs-coach-gregg-popovich-dies-wednesday\n\nEDIT: Grammar\n\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Erin Popovich, the wife of Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich, died early Wednesday."}

Some info removed but you get the gist.\n\n&gt; Students and activists across the nation are calling for a National School Walkout on April 20, 2018 to honor the students who lost their lives at Columbine High School on the 20th Anniversary of that tragedy.  Recognizing this new growth in youth activism and the exercise of free speech and expression, there may be students within [this ISD] that choose to participate in a peaceful walkout. \n\n&gt; We always encourage free speech at [your] Elementary and respect the perspectives of others.  In [this ISD] a primary goal is to provide a quality education within a safe environment.  Any parent that wishes for their child to participate in a walkout on the 20th should contact the School Secretary, [name removed] by 5 PM this evening (4/19/18).  We will arrange for a safe and peaceful walk to our back field for fifteen minutes.  Please note that the school day will continue as scheduled.  If your student chooses to participate, he/she will be responsible for making up any work and assignments they missed. \n\nI love how the left like the concept of \"exercise of free of speech and expression\" but have no problem shutting down anyone they disagree with.  Beyond that, this does not fall under \"free speech and expression\".  Are ISD admins suggesting students can say and do anything they want without consequences?

According to the vice-president of a famous bank, China had its own problems and the US just needed to be itself other than pushing it too hard as what President Trump was doing now. Another president of an information consultant Company took the same side, saying that \u201cdidn\u2019t the Soviet Union fall apart by itself? A tons of inner conflictions of those totalitarian governments will make them break apart from its inside.\u201d\n\nAlas! Even though I was one of the only two Chinese Americans there, I cannot hold my opinion anymore. I told them: We all know that the stone will finally become sands during weathering process, simply because stones are not made of single material, but of different type of crystals comprising multiple molecular structures. As times goes by, all sorts of natural environment such like temperature changes cause tensions among crystals, which leads to the final disintegration of the stone. However, what about if somebody removes the tension and uses superglue to stick all different crystals together? \n\nThey all laughed: \u201cHow could such kind of superglue ever even exist which could penetrate into stones and perfectly combine all those crystals!\u201d\n\nYes it does exist! \n\nI brought out a piece of Dollar: this is the superglue of China and it\u2019s made in USA. We can say that in the past decades, without supports of America, Chinese Economy won\u2019t be any better than today\u2019s Korea. At least its economic collapse would be a past tense already. \n\nThe discussion later on didn\u2019t lead to any unanimous answer. This is part of the American culture: If not for scrupulous academic discussion, all debates are superficial and depthless. Nobody is going to persuade another person. \n\nBut I do understand their view point. It\u2019s not fresh at all. It\u2019s a perspective from the bi-hegemony era of US and the Soviet Union.  And yes the result did happen according to this script. Or we could say that this was the very foundation of the Peaceful Evolution: Waiting in the forest for a bunny to run into a tree and knock itself out, as long as it is a stupid bunny. \n\nObviously, today\u2019s China is not a stupid bunny as the Soviet Union at all. Most importantly, China has connected itself economically with the US and the whole world. You are in me and I am in you. This is totally different as the era of Soviet Union. At that time, the western and eastern were having incompatible economical systems and rarely connected with each other. And this was the economical reason which caused the collapse of Soviet Union, and it is the most crucial reason as well. \n\nApparently China learned a good lesson from the collapse of Soviet Union. It wrapped its own economic system tightly with the West, just like a leech on a cow. It doesn\u2019t only stop on the surface of the cow, but deeply into its blood vine. Therefore, the fantasy of waiting for the collapse of Chinese economy is not reliable at all. The huge trade deficit of western world to China every year is analogous to a cow feeding leeches with its own blood, or adding superglue into a stone. The Trade War of President Trump is not pushing it too hard, but way too late. It can only stop the bleeding. That\u2019s all. If we expect China to collapse like Soviet Union, another cold war is absolutely needed: THE COLD WAR 2.0. \n\nIt has been more than a quarter of a century since the cold war ended. And it happened to be the three decades that China\u2019s economy took off and the West lost itself. In these three decades, the prospering Science and technology didn\u2019t bring more wealth and progress for the western society. To the opposite, we are facing more threats and vulnerability. Since the World War II, Islam became a disastrous impendence to the civil world unprecedentedly, which did not only stay in the Middle East but went deeply into Europe, the origin of modern civilization. Here I won\u2019t discuss more about this. What\u2019s more, the rise of China multiplied the variables to the global situation and this was why the Sino-America relationship became a main topic in a business dinner. \n\nAfter cold war, Dr. Fukuyama, in his ecstasy, wrote his book, The End of History and the Last Man, in which he proclaimed that the Democratic System is the final stop of human society. But now would he be as confident to himself as before? \n\nWhen it comes to Sino-America discussion, it would be absolutely defective if we only stopped at the Trade War. And this has been the deficit of all US presidents since Clinton: just like Dr. Fukuyama, the end of Cold War leads them to an illusion of overconfidence and arrogance against China, which generated the dilemma that the US and West have to confront today.  \n(WRITTEN by Alex Lu, TWITTER: yjpc1989) \n\n1)  Advantage of the System\n\nReferring to China\u2019s advantage, westerners always concentrate on its large population and huge market. The advantage of population will disappear anyway. India is also populous, but from the past history until today, did any country ever worry about the rise of India? No. Therefore, here what I want to talk about is the advantage of Chinese system. \n\nI believe many people would already reject my standpoint when reading this. At least they took it for granted that Chinese system cannot rival the American one. Surely I am a rigid advocate of democracy. But it does not mean that democracy has natural advantage on all aspects and could shatter all other systems, including Chinese system. \n\nFirstly, how should we definite Chinese system? Political and cultural dictatorship and economic freedom.  Characteristic Chinese corruption is the inevitable result of the combination of the two. Anybody who had business in both China and US would agree with this: the economic atmosphere is more liberal than US in many aspects. Specifically, this is an advantage under political dictatorship: under the rule of man, a certain kind of freedom is granted to economic behavior.  China has no trade unions and no laws that rigidly restrict the behavior of capitalist ---- even if there are, it\u2019s super flexible. \n\nWe all know that the main driving force for economic development comes from capital. As people who hold capital, capitalists are certainly the impelling hand behind economic prosperity. If ten thousand workers were assigned to a government, the government would not be able to make sure all those workers earn a living for themselves, and it has to shoulder the cost of their living, not to mention to realize economic growth. But if one capitalist was assigned to a government, this capitalist would transfer  local resources to economic vitality just for his own \u201csmall goals\u201d. \n\nCompared with Chinese system, the western world has an almost perfect legal system, which greatly restricts government and protects human rights of every human being. This is why I vote for democratic system. But this system cannot positively propel economic development but drag it backward.  This is the reason I strongly brace the idea of small-size government in the West, at least domestically. Looking at the results, the difference between economic managements by China and western government started to formulate a conception in people\u2019s mind: Chinese system is more efficient than democracy. And this is where Xi Jinping\u2019s illusionary confidence comes from. \n\nOf course, there are numerous evidences against this point. But if we only look at things from economic growth and social construction within a certain period of time, this perspective is very reasonable. Even in the United State, the New Deal by President Franklin D. Roosevelt had a lot of similarity with this kind of Chinese system: a government holding huge resources would stimulate investment. \n\n2) Cost of Extensive Human Right\n\nThe western world defeated its biggest rival in cold war, and went way too far in welfare society. The enforcement of law, together with the rising of human right, is dampening the enthusiasm of capitalists. No matter this is right or wrong, at least one of the serious consequences is the outflow of traditional industries, with the exception of some high-return business as those related with high-tech and innovation. Even without China, those traditional industries would drain to other countries. Actually it betrayed the modern western value: Extensive human right. If nobody in western countries would like to get involved into those seemingly-to-be low-end industries, why should they shift those industries to peoples from other countries? Surely it was caused by the inequality of economy. The low-cost of labor in China and other developing countries will definitely spur this industrial transfer. The cost of labor includes human right.  \n\nThe West gives way too much attention to human right, to an unimaginable extent, which greatly increased the cost of capital growth. \n\nAdam Smith, in his Wealth of Nations, wrote that the growth of national wealth is determined by one crucial element: technique, skill and judgment of labor. As an entrepreneur who owns business in both China and US, I am under the rough impression that individual Chinese workers are far less efficient than those in the US. Obviously, the technique, skill and judgment of labors in free and open society are a lot better than those in a dictatorial regime. This is why the US has only \u00bc of the population of China but could create more wealth. This also means that the cost of labor in a bunch of local product is not skyrocketing to an unacceptable extent. For the same product, China need more labor time. I calculated a business program in 2015, including the transportation cost, the labor cost in the US is only 25 percent high than that in China. I would say this distance is not unbridgeable. \n\nHowever, if all those restrictions upon capitalists of American law ---- some time only the political correctness is more than enough ---- are taken into consideration, contrasting with the freedom of Chinese business environment, the overall American product are way higher than that of China. Basically all the American entrepreneurs had been sued by their employees. I personally experienced with one case brought by a previous employee (and I won), and it was absolutely fabricated false accusation. However, under the environment of extensive human right, an employee could falsely sue his boss without any cost (not even the lawyer fee), without concern of being punished if he lost the case. Is that fair? In contrast, most capitalists in China have never heard of that. \n\n(WRITTEN by Alex Lu, TWITTER: yjpc1989) \n\nSo, this advantage from low human right originated from \u201crule of man\u201d, instead of \u201crule of law\u201d. The government is used to the \u201crule of man\u201d and so are the common people. Especially, in business activities, the ruling man has enough executive power, with a certain extent of supervision from the upper level. This type of management in economic activities can lower the cost of gaining interest from capital, especially of those large capitals. In this case, the shift of industries is inevitable. Nobody can stop those western international companies from transferring their industries. \n\nThose benefiting from the industrial shift are countries such like Japan and South Korea, the democratic countries which has adopted similar political systems as the Europe and America. They changed their own domestic economic situation by accepting western manufacture industries and also reallocated wealth perfectly under the democratic government and benefited their people. However, for those countries who refused to take the democratic political mode, or those who do not have a stable democratic system, this industrial shift didn\u2019t bring success to them. To the opposite, this industrial transfer only magnified the distances of the poor and rich, because those governments didn\u2019t distribute the accumulated wealth from this fairly enough and it resulted the concentration of wealth into a few hands. And this is why those countries with low human right failed. \n\nIf we can say that long time ago those countries have a small ration of population and wouldn\u2019t affect other western countries, the large foundation of Chinese population totally crushed this industrial shift mode. Today, Chinese tycoons have been escalating the price of real estate in many European countries as well as in America, and this almost overturned the whole traditional western real estate market. In a word, the worldly enlargement of the distance between the rich and poor is mainly caused by the Chinese mode.  \n\nOn one side it is the western political system with extensive human right, and on the other side it is the Chinese one with low human right. There should be no reconciliation between the two if not for the globalization. High-technology made it extremely easy to communicate among people, information and capitals. It\u2019s like adding water into heated oil and will surely go crackling and spluttering.\n\nI am all for human right. And I have been persecuted in China because the human rights are not protected there. However, in the current situation of heated oil mixing with water, should we re-considerate about if the western human right protection goes way to far that it became an obstacle of social progress especially economic development? If Adam Smith resurrect today, he would definitely lament: today\u2019s western world is not the West with free market anymore! Any protection of human right that is beyond a necessary extent is becoming the burden of economic development. If the whole world are the same and own a united standard, I would vote for this kind of human right protection: whoever wouldn\u2019t like the idea of eating without working! But tragically, the western world only has 1/10 of the global population and it is surrounded by wolves like China, Russia and Islam. It is time for us to wake up from the illusionary confidence of the Clinton Time! \n\n3) Poor Individuals, Prosperous Country\n\nFor individualists, the wealth of people means the wealth of nation. Simply, the purpose of a nation is to serve its nationalities. But for those collectivists, whether the people is poor does not matter ---- even though they themselves don\u2019t want to be poor either ---- what does matter is the power and wealth of a nation. This is actually the so called greatest achievement of China in the past thirty years: Poor people and powerful nation. Nevertheless, when two countries confront with each other, it means confrontation between two nations, and most directly, between governments who are on behalf of the nations. It is useless to compare the wealth between an individual American family and a Chinese family. From this aspect, Chinese government obviously has advantages that American government doesn\u2019t have. \n\nWake up! You conceited Yankees who believe that US will win. How could the US government fight against a government who can print money unlimitedly? How could the US government fight against a government who can add taxable items whenever they want to? How could the US government fight against a government who never needs to worry about unemployment rate? A government who doesn\u2019t need to consider the insurance and pension of old people, a government who doesn\u2019t need to concern about the inflation, the dropping down of stocks by its limit, a government who doesn\u2019t care about those children dropping off from school, a government who controls the media and internet, a government who can slaughter its people as how they wish to, how could you fight against it? \n\nAnd such government could ever exist? Yes it doesn't only exist, but becomes the second biggest government in the world! Take a look! How unfair this world is! This is the fact. Those who are crying about how unfair the American government is, you\u2019d better print this paragraph and stick it on your forehead. Whenever you are whining about how unfairly you are treated, look into the mirror and read it. \n\nLook at those poor Chinese people. Different as you Yankees who get fussy all the time about those trivial stuffs in your life, how submissive they are!  In front of the powerful they are licking their ass; In front of Police Officer they would even control the way they walk! When seeing unfair things they would at most sigh, but probably just close their eyes, pretending that they didn\u2019t see anything. If not forced to rebel the authority, they don\u2019t even know how to complain. This is a race that the westerners can never understand, and they are controlled by a bully government. Moreover, the huge trade difference between China and US are made by their hands. In another words, they worked really hard with their own hands and built for themselves a most modernized pigsty! Isn\u2019t that miserable? Isn\u2019t that horrible!  \n\nChina\u2019s overall GDP cannot compare with US and GDP per capita is lower than US too. China\u2019s military strength and technology is not as good as US either. However, the resources under the control of Chinese government are way more than US government! Chinese government could drive their soldiers like animals, and a bunch of Chinese are stealing technology in the US and sending it back to China. This is the reality we got to know. Who is more powerful? \n\nDon\u2019t use Soviet Union as an example. The collapse of that communist regime was not historically doomed! Otherwise, there wouldn\u2019t be a second powerful government rising to be US\u2019s rival in such a short period! \n\n4) Stability of Policy\n\nWithout any doubt, one weakness of democratic system is that their policies are not stable enough. Like China, the Mao\u2019s era could be three decades\u2019 of Left Wing and after that is another three decades\u2019 of Right Wing in Deng\u2019s era. This is unimaginable in the US. Within a term of four years, a succeeding president is always eager to erase off all his predecessor\u2019s policies to prove that he himself is freaking damn good. This US system has no problem domestically, because no matter whoever became the President, they have one explicit goal: doing good in economy. And they have one enemy: Economic Recession. \n\nAs for its foreign policy, unless fighting with deadly enemies such as Germany and Japan in World War II, Soviet Union in Cold War, US even has difficulty to triumph over a small country. Some good examples are Korea War, Vietnam War, Iraq, and so like. Among all failures of those wars there was a same reason: Inconsistent policy. Democratic system weakened and blurred the resolution of the States and along with the end of a presidential term, game was over. In fact, every president has to face the mid-term election, plus the four-year limitation of a term. So, if a president just wants to destroy America intentionally just like OBAMA, or just wants to dawdle on his Presidential Seat like Clinton, his time would be super easy. \nHowever if he wants to have any achievement on Foreign Policy, he would have a really hard time. Therefore we should understand how resolute President Trump\u2019s attitude is in launching the Trade War. \n\nVery different from the former Soviet Union, one the one hand, China is really good at gaining and utilizing favor from the US, who has never treated China as its rival in history, but not being grateful at all, or just pretending to be grateful. This is one of most absurd drama in World Political History. On the other hand, China knows all the weakness of the US. For this reason, even for a President like Bush, who swore to God to stall China in his election, all his aspiration was gone with the wind, depleted by China. We can say that China, among all US\u2019s rivals in history, showed the best apprehension of America\u2019s weakness. In these three decades, China\u2019s most effective strategy against US is: to POSTPONE! Just wait, hold on, this President was gone. Another president came, with his new cabinet, just wait, and hold on, he will be gone! \n(WRITTEN by Alex Lu, TWITTER: yjpc1989)\n\nAnd China itself, not to mention that Xi Jinping is going to be lifetime president, even in the Era of Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, their opinions are unanimous towards how to deal with the US.  So, if there is confrontation between China and the US, if not a life-and-death battle, here is a good bet: China Wins.   \n\n5) Trade War CANNOT solve the problem\n\nIf only from the perspective of trade balance, US will certainly win the trade war. Just like what President Trump said, a country losing almost 400 billion dollars every year has nothing to lose. However, it is too shallow to analyze Sino-American relationship from the aspect of economic interest only. The importance of this trade war is that it would probably determine the direction of what human civilization will go in the next one hundred years. \n\nProblem between China and the US is not the trade balance, but the conflict between two ways and two cultures. The West is in trust of Multi-culture and this belief itself is part of its culture. In Chinese history, it has been a uniform country with a single culture. Two hundred years ago, all different countries lived by themselves.  But in an internet age like now, it is impossible to segregate each other from the network of people and information. Conflict is unavoidable. It was not so distinct before only because the West is too powerful and China has no confidence in challenging. Nevertheless, along with the expansion of China\u2019s economic power today, the confidence in Chinese traditional culture with its contemptuousness is doomed to emerge. It was an incidental event that Xi Jinping came to power, and if another person was in his position perhaps China would not be as aggressive as it is today. Yet the ideology of \u201cDivined Dynasty, Centric Empire\u201d inherited from thousands years of traditional Chinese culture is extremely liable to explode. Think about South Korea, a nation raped by North Korea, when it comes to the issue of United South and North Korea, or national self-esteem, it immediately loses its rationality. This is the essence of Oriental Culture. \n\nIt is said that Sino-American relationship is different from that of US and Soviet Union because there is no collision of ideology. But what is more lethal is that not only there is cultural conflict but ideology is only part of culture. If we can say that the culture of Soviet Union is essentially western and concentrates on individualism, Chinese culture is oriental by its nature and it emphasizes collectivism. If not the advanced western technology defeated China in Tsing Dynasty, would Chinese people ever want to change their own life style? By no means! Therefore, why there are so many young patriots in China is not only a consequence of brain wash by the government. Instead, government maneuvered the conceitedness of collectivism derived from Oriental Culture. \n\nUltimately, the confrontation between China and US is that of individualism and collectivism. Individualists pursue freedom and collectivists focus on succession. Which one is right? Which one is wrong? It is not important any more. It doesn\u2019t matter. What does matter is which one is going to win the battle. \n\n6) COLD WAR 2.0\n\nHuman being is living for his or her ideas. What we think is right might be very wrong in other people\u2019s eyes. It won\u2019t really affect our lives until one side is determined to annihilate the other one and wipe him from the earth. To withdraw cannot avoid confrontation.  \n\nNowadays China is exactly the one side haunting and stalking to devour and ravage the other one. Seemingly this confrontation was triggered by Trump\u2019s trade war but actually it came from Xi Jinping\u2019s imperial ambition. If my argument goes to the right direction, Xi Jinping is an extraordinarily ambitious leader. However, his passion is significantly inconsistent with the value of modern civilization. He wants to be one of those outstanding emperors in Chinese history such like Tangtaizong (\u5510\u592a\u5b97) , Kangxi (\u5eb7\u7199) and so like. As for how much the people suffered under their reign doesn\u2019t matter to him at all. If he determined to emulate those emperors, assuredly the most achievement he could ever think of is to confront and defeat the US. We have to admit that considering the reality, Xi Jinping might not be too determined to start the war against the US. Other than that, his secondary objective is to take over US\u2019s hegemonic position in the world. This is probably the target in Xi Jinping\u2019s plan, or at least, he wants China to become the former Soviet Union, standing as the other pole as same as the US. \n\nAllegedly, China doesn\u2019t have the same ideology as the Soviet Union. However, it has its culture: a pragmatism culture that is reckless and heedless. This is a prolongation of Chinese traditional culture and it substantially exceeds the communism and is way more vigorous. This could explain why Russians seemed to be more honest in their competition with US. For example, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Russians promised not to set the missile system in Cuba and they didn\u2019t do it, even though there were several presidential shifts in the US after that. If China was in that situation, after it promised to President Kennedy, during President Johnson\u2019s term it would stealthily ship its missile to Cuba again. Wasn\u2019t it what happened after they made their promises in WTO? \n\nTherefore, the seemingly-to-be military and economic confrontation between China and US is actually cultural confrontation: Rule of Man versus Rule of Law, Stratum versus Equality, Privilege versus Human Right, and Corruption versus Honesty: in a word, Evil versus Virtue! \n\nIn fact, I am not really contented with the extravagant virtue of the West. This kind of \u201cvirtue\u201d has reached a point of harming oneself without impairing enemies. There is no pure \u201cvirtue\u201d on the earth and all virtues should be practiced on the condition of self-protection. Other than that, \u201cvirtue\u201d means foolishness. But if I have to choose one between \u201cEvil\u201d and \u201cFoolishness\u201d, I would rather choose \u201cvirtue\u201d. \n\nEven if the trade balance between US and China is realized, is their confrontation preventable? Is China\u2019s occupation of Taiwan preventable? Is it preventable for China to buy and corrupt some small countries and  spread their virus of this \u201cevil\u201d culture?  By no means!  \n\nThe Trade War is a poor choice out of no choice and it was delayed for at least a decade. If today we still cannot realize the destined confrontation between China and the US, after ten years we have to regret another loss of a decade! \n\nSo what we should do now is to launch the COLD WAR 2.0 between China and US! \n\nIn 1946, right after the World War II, George Kennan, deputy chief of the mission in Moscow, sent the famous \u201clong telegram\u201d to the State Department, in which he explained in detail Soviet Domestic society and its foreign policy, and formulated the policy of \u201ccontainment\u201d, the long-term United States  strategy for fighting against the Soviet Union. The policy of containment finally became the basic strategy of US. Now when talking about Kennan\u2019s contribution, all nice words putting together are not enough to salute him. Without the \ncontainment policy, there wouldn\u2019t be the COLD WAR later on. Though, for a country like US with no consistent policy, that Kennan\u2019s strategy could be adopted for several decades is not because of his GOD-like influence, but because the powerfulness of Soviet Union was intimidating enough to threaten the national security of the US. Kennan only made Americans realize the danger of Soviet Union. \u00a0\n\nUntil today, the US has lost at least ten years. The dust from the newly started Trade War is not settled down yet. Is there going to be a peaceful result, or a deteriorated situation? It depends on the negotiation between China and US leadership. But undoubtedly, Americans need a new contemporary Kennan to send them another \u201clong telegram\u201d: Without a COLD WAR 2.0, the US is doomed to lose! Not only a problem of losing the trade war, but a huge retrogression of human civilization! \n\n20180406","subreddit":"The_Donald","title":"Cold War 2.0""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Cold War 2.0 between USA and China"}

Being silent is NOT an option. It's either I agree with them on everything they say or I'm some lowly black woman seeking \"white validation\".\n\nI won't lie to you, this pisses me off.\nApparently in the liberal community everyone is free to have independent thoughts and ideas until the very moment that those ideas poke outside the bubble of what liberals say.\n\nAt that moment I am no longer a \"proud\" or \"strong black woman\". At that point I'm a coon, bedwench, and house slave seeking approval from the white race.\n\nYou can't make this crap up.\n\nApparently, calling me out of my name, and stereotyping is okay once they've decided I'm \"problematic\", but not okay for comedians to do because it might hurt my feelings and it's best to be \"politically correct\"?! Not only is it trashy, it's hypocritical. They say things like, \"You're a straight white male so your arguments invalid.\" Even if a bisexual black woman agrees with him?\n\nIt's so obvious that they're trying to silence conservative minorities, because it seems to oddly work to their benefit. I've noticed that when conservatives groups start to see a lack of conservative minorities they start believing that liberals speak for us.\n\nAnd I've seen some borderlining racist post (not here, on other websites for conservatives) thinking that every minority believes in things like cultural appropriation, or 72 genders. And these things prove to push conservative minorities from speaking out even more because it seems everyone has already made up their minds about us. \n\n*END RANT*\nMy point is that we exist.

{"author":"Reptillianbobcat","created_utc":1524778921,"num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"I was going through my YouTube feed earlier and saw this video \\( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS3toephRDM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eS3toephRDM) \\) from Kyle Kulinski of secular talk who is a big Bernie supporter and progressive talking about how great this new proposal being put forward to give everyone who wants a job in America a job.  I figured you folks might enjoy the comment I left :D\n\n/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /\n\nSo this proposal is full of gaping problems that Kyle didn't address, I'll just list a few of them here along with the reasons they are problems.  Before you freak out and start screaming right winger, I'm not, I'm a centre left person who used to be a communist, who used to be a socialist and who used to be a massive Bernie supporter.  I'm not anymore and that's why I know this plan is terrible, because 2\\-3 years I would have agreed with it and I was a bad person then.  I really hope you take the time to read what I've written and really think about it.\n\nThe number 1 problem, which is the most glaring, they have no idea how much this will cost and if they do they aren't saying because they know it's ridiculous.  I thought Ted Cruz actually put it very well in one of the debates he had with Bernie on healthcare when he said that his universal healthcare proposal would cost 13 trillion dollars \\(On the low end of estimates, but at that point it doesn't really matter if its 13 or 30 trillion\\) and that even if Bernie taxed every single millionaire and billionaire at 100&amp;#37; he wouldn't pay for that and those people wouldn't have any money to tax the next year.  This is a key problem with people like Bernie Sanders who run around saying America is the richest nation in the world \\(as it's 20trillion in debt\\) and acting like America can afford to pay for any social program he wants it to.  The fact is America is the wealthiest nation on earth because its citizens have lots of money, not its government, and that wealth does not belong to the government, it belongs to those citizens.  Sorry to break it to you.  This is one thing the corporate and regressive democrats agree on, they have a right to citizens money.  Just look at how they treat tax cuts, socialists act like the government taking less of peoples money is stealing because they can't redistribute that wealth to the people who vote for them.  Take a second and really think about that.\n\nMy second  problem is not so much with the proposal itself but with the way Kyle is defending the simple question of how much is it gonna cost and who is gonna pay for it.  The whataboutism progressives \\(and conservatives to be fair\\) are constantly engaged in when it comes to government spending is actually very grating for anyone who isn't a partisan hack.  Just because neocons set trillions of dollars on fire in the desert and some hypocrites did hypocritical shit in response doesn't give you a blank cheque to spend on whatever bullshit will make you feel good.  This is the go to excuse for progressives when someone asks them \"How are you gonna pay for that\" they reeeee \"Well the bush neo\\-cons wasted trillions in Iraq\".  that's not an argument, that's a deflection.  Was the Iraq war dumb, sure it was, that doesn't make this proposal any less dumb \\(and expensive, but I'll put that math below\\)\n\nJust doing some quick maths that I'll lay out here so you can do it on your own, there are 6.6 million people who were unemployed in march 2018 \\(4.1&amp;#37;\\), and say you pay each one of them 15$ an hour for 8 hours a weekday with 2 weeks paid vacation, it comes to around 30,000$ a year, then you add on health benefits which generally costs the government about 10,000$ a year in the socialist republic of Canada \\(say 7,000$ American just to be conservative in these estimates\\) 37,000$ in compensation times 6.6 million unemployed equals 224 billion, 200 million dollars per year in just wages and benefits for these programs, not even taking account the infrastructure spending itself.  However then you have to take into account the number of people making less than the sum total of these benefits, Kyle and TYT used to always go off about how half of Americans make less than 30,000$ a year, remember that?  How many of those people do you think have benefits?  I'm guessing not a lot.  That means as many as half of the American work force could see this plan as an improvement, in which case why wouldn't they do the rational thing and sign on.  If even half of them did there would be 56.6milion people registering for this program.  In other words take that 224.2 billion number and turn it into 2.094 trillion dollars a year in wages and benefits.\n\nTake another second and ask yourself why it is that I can do that math with 4 google searches and my phones calculator, yet a sitting US senators staff can't figure this out to tell a newspaper?  Could it be because if Bernie were president and implemented this not only would it gut the American economy, probably irreversibly, but it would also cost the government a little over 8.3 trillion dollars per term.  I think he and everyone else would only have to worry about 1 term at that point though.\n\nI'm sure some of you are now thinking, \"but how could employing people gut the economy, that's the whole point of the economy, to employ people.\" well you're half correct if you are thinking that.  The point of an economy is to facilitate trade and commerce in order to generate capital for investment in things that will create more trade and commerce for entrepreneurial people, the fact that people have to be employed in that is only a positive side effect.  The key rule of economics is supply and demand, the lower the supply the higher the demand, and this is true for labour as well, the left understands this, but they dont know how to properly apply this concept.  I could get into the hypocrisy of the lefts stance on illegal immigration, including Bernie sanders flip flop from railing against the Koch brothers on the issue to siding with them after being pressured by Latino advocacy groups in the primaries, but I'll focus on the issue that is more at play here \\(giving the benefit of the doubt that this program would only be available to US citizens\\) which is automation.  If the government artificially lowers unemployment and provides a job at above minimum wage, what is the private sector going to do?  Just look at the current fight for 15$ nonsense progressives are engaged in, is a company going to compete with a federal government that just gave 15$ an hour wages and health benefits when it is looking for a check out clerk or is it going to automate?  Is a fast food place going to hire some teenager who wants to work part time while going to school at 15$ an hour or are they going to automate \\(youth unemployment in America is 4 times the national average btw\\) If this program were implemented companies would immediately double or even triple the speed of automation, people would be locked into working for 15$ an hour and benefits for the government because there be no place for the vast majority of low skilled labour in the private market.  That isn't even to get into how this would effect small business's in rural areas who frankly probably can't afford to compete with the compensation the government would be offering, but hey, the big cities are 2/3 of the GDP, those are the places that matter according to Hillary.\n\nAnother little side note, I really enjoyed how Kyle describes the progressive view of the Overton window, \"we'll come in with something crazy and stupid, and then in a few years we'll say something even crazier and more idiotic and it'll make the first thing seem reasonable\" this is hilarious on two fronts, the first is apparently Kyle has been reading the art of the deal and the second is this mindset validates every slippery slope argument made against progressives.  Gun control went from maybe we need background checks to repeal the second amendment \\(Thanks justice stevens for that gem\\) for instance.\n\nThe important thing to do with a proposal like this is to take it to its logical conclusion.  Approx. 50million people lets say on the governments payroll, probably still needing food stamps and other such benefits, doing low skilled infrastructure work for the government like painting schools, picking up litter, filling potholes etc.  Oh and I know you were probably imagining crews of people with shovels and picks building roads and dams and what not, but that's the problem with this new deal nostalgia, it's not 1940 anymore and 20&amp;#37; of the population isn't considered to be unemployed.  Roads aren't built by huge teams of people with shovels, they are built with heavy machinery operated by people trained to do so.  Think about the last time you drove by municipal road work, how many people did you see leaning on their shovels drinking coffee?   How many people with shovels are you willing to see your federal government pay with your money to fill in potholes and pick up litter in Kansas?  Take a second and really think about what is being proposed here and what the consequences will be beyond just the feel good, the govt is gonna take care of people stuff.  This would more than double the size of government in low skilled workers, not even counting the massive bureaucracy that would be required for logistics.\n\nP.S. There's a lot of other stuff I could have said and gone into more detail about, but its a YouTube comment and I've been here thinking and looking into things for about an hour, which is more time than I wanted to dedicate to this but here you go.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"A response to some of the problems in Bernie Sanders job guarantee proposal"}

I go to college in the leftist nut job state of Massachusetts, and last night I went to a party and decided to wear my Regan/Bush \u201884 shirt. This may have been a dumb move considering the complete lunatics who usually attend these parties. Anyway, people are making snide comments to me throughout the night, but nothing too bad until I walked into a room where a group of angry feminist SJW\u2019s started yelling at me about some bad things Reagan did as president. Listen, I don\u2019t love every single thing Reagan did but overall he was a good conservative and the shirt looks pretty cool. They get all up in my face and then I walked out of the room and they started yelling \u201cYo fuck him up!!\u201d Clearly these are nice reasonable people. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later I was somewhere else at the party just standing by myself texting when these SJWs come back up to me and start yelling at me again. I\u2019m not the aggressive type so I basically tried defusing the situation and getting the hell out of there. The leader of these SJWs started fuming and saying she actually wanted to fight me outside. I said that I obviously didn\u2019t want to fight her but her and her friends kept moving in on me so I got the hell out of there. I was definitely a little rattled the rest of the night and needless to say I\u2019m never going back there again.
