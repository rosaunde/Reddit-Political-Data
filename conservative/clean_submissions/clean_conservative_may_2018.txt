{"author":"Msmith68w","created_utc":1525362448,"num_comments":41,"score":69,"selftext":"*Disclaimer: I realize Libertarianism is separate from Conservatism. I use the slash to say that I'm Libertarian on some issues and Conservative on others. Not fully in either camp. Use the political compass to see what I mean if this is confusing: https://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2*\n\nI thought I'd take a few moments to share the story of my political transformation to give you all some hope or a good laugh.  \n\nI grew up in what I would call a slightly right leaning family. We never discussed politics, but as far as I am aware, they have all been voting mostly republican for decades. I never really agreed with my family about religion, and that was a wedge that drove us apart. I saw their religiosity as an underlying driver of their conservatism so I have no doubt that made me more sensitive to leftist ideology.\n\nGrowing up, I didn't give politics a lot of thought. I operated according to a quote from the comedian Lewis Black \"Choosing between republican and democrat is like choosing from two bowls of shit, the only difference is the smell\". I never had faith that political activism meant or accomplished anything, so I didn't vote, and didn't follow politics at all. \n\nIn college, I mostly maintained this belief but was starting to be drawn in by liberal ideas. Whenever politics came up, all the very highly educated, articulate, intellectuals I knew (professors and such) were very vocally on the left. As I got further into academia and began to really respect the pursuit of knowledge and intellectualism, I found myself following in their footsteps. I remember thinking...these people are doctors and lawyers and university professors. They're very intelligent people who think things through. Clearly they understand the ramifications of political ideologies better than my parents and grandparents who are only high school graduates with lower-middle class careers. I actually remember having a conversation with my grandfather (the sweetest man in the world) who asked me \"At your university, are all the professors liberal and atheist?\" to which I responded \"Well yeah, I think being smart and being liberal/atheist go hand in hand\"...not proud of that statement.\n\nI entered graduate school in 2015 at about the time Bernie Sanders began his campaign. I remember reading all these articles (with scholarly references) talking about how his ideas were so good and would be great for the economy. I got really into watching videos created by Robert Reich (former labor secretary under clinton and now UC Berkely professor) including his documentary \"Inequality For All\". The idea that the rich were raping and pillaging our society was something I deeply believed in. I started to declare that we needed to \"get money out of politics\" and \"make the rich pay their fair share\". \n\nI believed in the wage gap, gay marriage (still do on this one), and transgender advocacy. I thought the US was doing more harm in the world than good with our military action. I believed in campus rape culture, systemic racism/sexism, women's right to choose, and the wonders of social medicine. I thought the right was full of hypocrites that were religiously motivated and only thinly veiling their desires to force jesus into everyone's bedrooms. \n\nDuring the 2016 election, I constantly hounded my family to vote against Trump. Not because Hillary was so great, but because Trump was so awful. He was a rich (worst sin of all), white, male who assaulted women, hated blacks, and wanted nothing more than to give tax breaks to his billionaire buddies by pandering to ignorant christian conservatives. He was crazy and couldn't be trusted with nuclear codes. He would bankrupt the country and get us into wars because of his huge ego. I was downright rude to my family and talked down to them when they tried to articulate why they couldn't vote for Hillary(they didn't like Trump either). I made the case that government isn't a business and can't be run like one. I implied that they were stupid and racist....and I'm ashamed of all of it. \n\nThe 2016 election results were a shock. I think everyone expected a landslide for Clinton. I didn't participate much in the outrage or backlash that occurred, I sort of just tuned it all out and went back to living my life. \n\nNearly a year passed. I graduated school and landed my first big job...at a university...in an office full of very liberal women. I participated in the off hand Trump bashing, and it certainly helped develop rapport. \n\nAnd then, something interesting happened...Parkland. Specifically, the CNN Gun Control Town Hall.\n\nYou see, I didn't go straight from high school to college. I did an enlistment with the US Army. So I was quite familiar with firearms and AR-15/M16's specifically, and the utter nonsense (never-mind the blatant disregard for decency) that was spouted during that town hall, and in the media surrounding it, gave me pause. How could some of the most intelligent people I know, people who's careers are built on creating air-tight arguments/hypotheses, regurgitate such drivel. It was clear that they hadn't done 5 seconds of research on the topic. They just swallowed, accepted, and spat back out a bunch of garbage statistics about \"gun violence\" without looking at the methodology. They got up on their soap box and voiced platitude after platitude about how civilians shouldn't have \"weapons of war\". At the same time, they were also condemning police officers (the state) for killing innocent, unarmed citizens (mostly black men). How could they not see this contradiction. The government should have a monopoly on firearms but yet the government is killing innocents? What?\n\nAbout this time, I discovered Steven Crowder and Ben Shapiro...and down the rabbit hole I went. Issue after issue, I learned new information that completely opened my eyes...and I changed my mind. \n\nI began to see that the lack of rational thought applied to the gun debate was applied to everything my liberal cohorts believed. There are 3 women and two men in my office. Two of the women make $100,000+ yearly, the other makes over $50,000. The two men make under $50,000...and yet, the highest paid woman in my office says things like \"I get paid 77 cents on the dollar a man makes\"(verifiably false) and \"women are underrepresented in research\"...when over 70 percent of our study participants are women. \n\nAnother that really got me was gender relations/political correctness. I am so sick and tired of being told that I'm a white man so I'm so fucking privileged and I'm an oppressor to everyone else. That my opinions and problems don't matter, and that I'm a racist/bigoted/violent/rapist who's propagating \"the patriarchy\". I'm tired of being shamed for being a man who's masculine and wanting to date/marry women who are feminine. I'm tired of 3rd wave feminism, the neutering of boys, and the attacking of good people who didn't hurt anyone. \n\nIssue by issue, week by week, I have found my old views to be 180 degrees wrong. I am now pro-life (with an exception for life of mother), anti-big government, etc...and happy about it. To use the o so overused phrase...I feel like I've taken the red pill and I can now see what truly is, rather than what I've been told to see. \n\nThanks for reading.

Parents are Democrats that have had a falling out with family members over the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nI always considered myself a Democrat/Liberal, but mostly because I never really cared or researched political issues, but I usually supported whatever political social media hashtag was trending that week, basically a typical uniformed progressive liberal \\(yuck\\). But then Trump won the election, but every media outlet/poll said Hillary was going to win, and I could not understand how that happened. This started my journey into learning how the world worked, forming my own opinion, and coming to the conclusion that I \\(like most people my age and younger\\) had been tricked. So I decided to discuss my new view of the world with my parents, don't worry, they didn't disown me \\(yet \\- haha\\).\n\nIt started with feminism, I explained how I could no longer claim that I was a feminist. Explaining how 50 years ago the feminist movement was a real movement, but in 2018, it's now useless. All the causes REAL feminist fought for have been achieved \\- hooray! My mom didn't like that. I then explained how the wage gap \\(at least the 77 cents on the dollar issue\\) has been debunked and I conceded a wage gap still exist, but it's closer to 6&amp;#37;, and then I gave the reasons I'm sure we all already know so I wont bore you.\n\nNext was Muslim immigration. My family is not religious, but we all believe in freedom to practice without persecution. I formed this argument using that logic to explain how every other religion on this planet has evolved over time to fit into the world around them... except for Islam. Then using the current issues happening in Europe to back up my arguments. I think this point might have gotten through, but no promises.\n\nWe also talked about illegal immigrants, gun control, affirmative action \\(especially when it comes to college students, which is a bullet proof argument. Not much gray area\\), yadda yadda yadda.\n\nThe biggest issue I think this country has \\(especially in the long term\\) is the attack on freedom of speech. From liberal ideology indoctrination by the education system, to the so called 'hate speech' protests, to the neutering of conservative views on social media. My parents are older and don't participate in social media beyond Liking family photos in their feed, so they had never heard of safe spaces or microaggressions or college rape culture or all the other bullshit you know is happening. I think this point got through, how our education system teaches kids these concepts as fact, which is going to make these poor kids unemployable in the future. A business owner is NEVER going to hire them as employees, which they will then use as \"proof\" that they are right about everything... but its not the bullshit they think exists, its because these poor brainwashed kids are a walking lawsuit. And since most of this garbage gains traction on social media, it's easy to find out what a potential employee believes by doing a quick Google search.\n\nI wrapped it up by having them watch Dave Rubin's video 'The Left is No Longer Liberal,\" not because I think he's the best person to sway their opinion, but dropping a Ben Shapiro or Milo video on them might of broke their brains, because I know when I watched them for the first time, it was a literal culture shock. Decided to ease them into the light instead of dropping them on the sun. Plus, it makes more sense to use a former democrat/liberal, than a hard core religious conservative \\- baby steps.\n\nSorry, I know this was long, but it went better than expected. I think I'm still invited to Thanksgiving dinner this year, but I guarantee I'll be put on the spot. I'll be even more educated and prepared by then, so no worries.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Had a discussion with my liberal parents about politics"}

{"author":"musashi66","created_utc":1525444622,"num_comments":2,"score":21,"selftext":"Here is the letter sent to all employees of the University. I was very glad to read this, as this university - as every other in the nation - seems to be very left leaning. I was a bit pissed that this came after a speech by conservative speakers - I guess they can't really hide their bias 100% in calling them \"provocative and controversial speakers\", but the gist of the message was good.\n\n**************************************************************************************************\n\nDear musashi66,\n\nI recently received a letter from the parent of one of our students that demonstrates free speech is alive and well at CU.\n\nThe parent wrote, \u201cWe've attended talks by Milo Yiannopoulos and Charles Murray. Both events were managed phenomenally well by the campus police. Neither speaker was interrupted, walked out on, or shouted down. And the attendees were safe. Charles Murray remarked about how exceptional it was to come to a campus and actually get to speak and answer questions.\u201d\n\nWhen the right-wing provocateur Yiannopoulos spoke at the University of California, Berkeley weeks before his CU appearance, a riot ensued, with smashed windows and burned cars. When Murray, author of the controversial book \u201cThe Bell Curve\u201d spoke at Middlebury College, he was shouted down and couldn\u2019t continue. A faculty member was hospitalized after the protest turned violent.\n\nSo what makes CU different, a place where provocative and controversial speakers are heard with civility and respect? The answer is we have been working for a decade to ensure a culture where our campuses value and promote free speech. Our bedrock belief is that we must teach students how to think, not what to think. Part of that is hearing varied \u2013 and sometimes uncomfortable or even ludicrous \u2013 viewpoints.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a conservative issue or a liberal issue. It\u2019s an issue for everyone who cares about our society and its future. And it\u2019s one liberals and conservatives must address together, much as we do with our Center for Western Civilization, Thought and Policy, which I have written about previously.\n\nOther universities are following our lead, including UC Berkeley, which is starting a center modeled on ours. Steven Hayward, CU\u2019s first Visiting Scholar in Conservative Thought and Policy, is leading their effort.\n\nFostering free speech also takes a united front from CU leadership \u2013 from the four campus chancellors to the Board of Regents to me. CU Boulder Chancellor Phil DiStefano gave his perspective in a recent communique, when he noted that discussion and debate are essential to enhancing educational experiences, creating and advancing knowledge, and ensuring a thriving democracy.\n\nCU embraces free speech, so it\u2019s important that our policies match our principles and practices. I\u2019m pleased that the Board of Regents is considering a provision of the Laws of the Regents that, for the first time, will make CU\u2019s commitment to freedom of expression part of our highest governing documents.\n\nCU campuses are places where ideas not only can clash, but should clash. It\u2019s only when they are subject to scrutiny that knowledge advances and learning occurs. We\u2019re proposing the Laws of the Regents recognize that \u201cthe university\u2019s faculty, staff and students have a responsibility to protect the university as a forum for the free expression of ideas.\u201d We also want it clear that \u201cthe free exchange of ideas includes not only the right to speak, but the right to listen.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not advocating that anyone needs to agree with someone else\u2019s ideas and theories. In fact, I encourage those who disagree to join the conversation. The correct response to offensive or objectionable ideas is to challenge them through reasoned debate, not suppression.\n\nRespecting someone\u2019s right to hold and express beliefs is different from saying every belief is entitled to respect. Some people believe the Earth is flat. I don\u2019t respect that opinion; I find it silly. The United States Supreme Court framed the issue when it found that flag burning, an act I personally abhor, is constitutionally permitted speech. The decision, which both Justice Thurgood Marshall and Justice Antonin Scalia joined, explained that \u201ca principal function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger.\u201d\n\nAlthough our country is divided in many ways, higher education must not shy away from contentious issues. We must give faculty the ability to engage and teach without fear that they will be attacked for taking on tough issues. We must give the students the opportunities and tools to critically evaluate what they hear so they can decide for themselves what to believe.\nOur campuses have hosted Milo and Murray, Republican presidential debates and Democratic presidential candidates, Vicente Fox debating Nigel Farage, Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. All have been welcome without the violence and incivility we have seen elsewhere. The marriage of policies and practices will help ensure that free speech always is welcome at CU. \n\nOther campuses call themselves the free speech campuses, but we can honestly call CU the free speech university.\n\nSincerely,\n \nBruce Benson\nPresident\n \t","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Just received this letter from the president of University of Colorado Denver regarding free speech on campus"}

I believe both of them have a reasonable chance at winning in the future. We all know millenials have strong liberal ties, but I believe these 2 candidates will be popular among younger voters as Gen Z appears to have conservative/libertarian leanings, and both Cruz and Paul fit that decscription. I think these 2 candidates firmly stand for a limited government, and maximum freedom. They both previously ran their 2016 campaigns promising true fiscal conservatism. They both promised to radically simplify he tax code and institute a flat tax, as well as drastically cutting spending. They both have promised to cut various wasteful and unnecessary (some might even say UNCONSTITUTIONAL) federal departments such as the IRS, the Departments of Education, Commerce, Agriculture, Housing and Urban Development, and Energy. Both are strong is their positions to combat illegal immigration as well as job killing regulations, are firm believers in our God given 2nd Amednment rights, and want to reform the healthcare system and open the industry up to the free market and get the government out of healthcare as much as possible. They are strong believers in our Consitution and will fight for for a smaller government and more freedom. \n\nWhat do you guys think about the post-Trump election and potential future candidates?","subreddit":"The_SAC","title":"[Discussion] Who is your favorite Presidential Candidate for 2024?""num_comments":30,"score":4,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"[Discussion] Who is your favorite Presidential Candidate for 2024?"}

{"author":"kekkersket","created_utc":1525646826,"num_comments":5,"score":15,"selftext":"This album shows Twitter's liberal bias when it comes to immense exposure tweets from certain accounts receive:\n\nhttps://cubeupload.com/codes/a93288\n\nThe album contains tweets from left-leaning accounts where the number of likes and retweets are disproportionate not only to the number of followers on the account, but the time that has passed between the tweet and the date of the screencap. All images have key figures highlighted with a red rectangle or yellow highlight.\n\nTo see how to examine these tweets, we can we can use the image named likeretweet017.png as an example.\n\nhttps://cubeupload.com/im/imagekek/likeretweet017.png\n\nThis user with only 4,241 followers made a tweet on Feb 19 that accumulated 123k retweets and 366k likes in 64.5 hours assuming the tweet was made at midnight (we have no timestamp). As you can see, that is massively disproportionate to their number of followers.\n\nNote: Twitter has two date/time formats: If under 24 hours, it just displays the number of hours since the tweet was made. If over 24 hours, it just shows the date without the time. When showing teh hours, this is a great frame of reference to show the tweet's age at time of screencap. However, when only the date is displayed, you have to assume the tweet could have been made as early as 12:00am that morning. For these, I include the time of cap to at least provide a reliable end time.\n\nYour challenge: Try to find one tweet from a conservative account that shares similar follower/like ratios within similar timespans. POTUS aside, I bet you won't be able to find ONE. Likes for tweets from conservative accounts typically cap off at 10-20k for all time. Never do conservatives tweets get likes in the range 100-200k within a few days time, let alone that many likes for all time period.\n\nBetween everything going on with Facebook, Twitter, Google, and YouTube, it's obvious that they've been prepping for a massive 2018 midterm victory. What they've been doing is weakening conservative networks by preventing us from collaborating which, in turn, hinders our ability to mobilize effectively. As for the left-leaning accounts, they are enjoying an immensely strong network (as demonstrated by the high number of likes/rewteets) which serves to keep communication strong between them as well as keep them invigorated. Wouldn't you have high spirits if you saw people like Paul Joseph Watson, Jordan Peterson, Lauren Southern, or any of your favorite right-wingers getting the same level of exposure for their tweets?\n\nAnd think about the adverse impact this has on culture. Look at the recent fiasco with David Hogg and Laura Ingraham. She lost a good number of advertisers thanks to Twitter amplifying the voices of the left. To the advertisers, their voices were strong and loud, but we conservatives sounded like mere mice in the midst of it all. And then there were the companies that removed discounts for NRA members. Same thing, the voices of the left were amplified which made them sound even greater in number, so those companies capitulated out of fear of being trampled by a mob that's nowhere near as big as they're made out to be.\n\nThere are 6 months until the 2018 midterms. If something isn't done to reverse the \"culture hacking\" executed by the monopolized and left-leaning social media, conservatives could lose big in 2018 and all elections going forward.\n\nEdit: Some of the users capped here have sometimes 100k+ followers, so you may wonder why I included them.  There are plenty of conservatives with just as many followers, yet their tweets still max out at 20k tops most of the time.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Twitter's Liberal Bias"}

Rand Paul and Ted Cruz represent a huge portion of the conservative movement. The WV race is very clear who would be the most conservative. Morrisey.\n\n**OH**: Ohio is tougher because the sporadic endorsements. Rand Paul and Liberty PAC endorsed Gibbons. That means he is strong for fiscal conservatism. But Jim Jordan, the leader of the freedom caucus endorsed his opponent Jim Rennaci. The NRA also endorsed Rennaci. Jim Jordan and Rand Paul are usually for the same guy so I\u2019m not sure on this one.\n\n**IN**: This one also seems easier but not quite as clear why. There is no major endorsements of anyone. Only 2 people have anyone even known endorsed. Coburn was a strong conservative in his stints as Rep and Senator. That coupled with the fact that the only other endorsement is Susan Brooks who has a 36% on conservative reviews means she is very moderate. So, this one based off endorsements is leaning hard to Mike Braun, the wealthy outsider.\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Today is Senate primary election day for 3 states.

{"author":"A-Fellow-American","created_utc":1525973773,"num_comments":2,"score":2,"selftext":"Hey Everyone!\n\nI have written a brief book. It\u2019s called \u201cLooking Past the Hysteria, a Brief look into why we voted Trump\u201d. As the title of the book suggests it covers a few topics and gives some insight as to why we chose to vote the way we did. I think it is something that everyone here might be interested in. My goal is for conservatives to send a copy to a liberal that they know to try to get them past the buzzwords and hate left over from the election. Here is the Link:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Looking\\-Past\\-Hysteria\\-Brief\\-Voted/dp/1717474527/ref=sr\\_1\\_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525973665&amp;sr=1\\-1&amp;keywords=Trump\\+hysteria\n\nThis book is not designed to be some ground breaking in your face \u201cred pill\u201d. It is more of a friendly nudge to get people on the left understanding that we have a difference of opinion and it is not based in hate or any other buzzwords they can think of. \n\nI chose to not write this book as an \u201cin your face, you are wrong\u201d style because I didn\u2019t think it was the effective way to reach people at this point in the political climate. The current political climate is on the verge of a big shift, and my book might be coming at just the right time for it. We have Kanye West bucking the Liberal narrative, we have Cadence Owens soring in popularity, polls are showing that the Democrats are losing millennial support and they are saying that \u201crepublicans are helping out with even the small things\u201d. President Trump is succeeding in North Korea like no one ever has, and is even in the prime spot for a Nobel Peace Prize. The media continues to show their bias and dropped the ball during the White House Correspondents dinner. All of this is leading to people on the left questioning their beliefs, and are now opening up to Trump style conservatism, while the liberals flail to try to keep people in line.\n\nI did not write this book bashing liberal viewpoints, although it does push back on them. The goal was to ease people into it. Would you have been as receptive to what you were learning if we screamed in your face how you were wrong? Or was starting by questioning your beliefs and letting you learn on your own more productive? I believe that a huge portion of the population is right at that position in their political stances where they are questioning what they have always \u201cknown\u201d. My book is designed to help them realize that our side is not hateful or racist. Once the lie of buzzwords collapses and they can\u2019t hide behind it anymore then they are forced to actually look at the information. This is where my book knocks down the first domino. This could lead to a massive red pilling, and it will be the best kind, one that they administer to themselves. Most people have to come to terms with their beliefs on their own; this book will help open the door for them.\n\nOf course there are those on the left that will never read it or never change their minds, and those are not the people that this book is written for. This book is for you to be able to give it to a friend, or a relative, or a coworker. Someone that might actually listen or at least they might begin to understand that your beliefs are not hateful. It can reopen the dialog that has been halted in the last year. My goal is for people to buy the book to send it to someone else, send it to friends family, celebrities, elected officials, President Trump himself. The more who read it the better.\n\nI have taken a hand full of sections from the book and posted them bellow; hopefully you will get an idea of what I covered:\n\n*\u201cHillary changes her positions with the wind, which is not always a bad thing. A person who has an opinion, looks at evidence and then alters or hardens their opinion based on that evidence is not inherently a bad person or dishonest. This however is not what I believe Hillary does. I feel bad for Hillary, she has no identity. Everything in her life everything that she is has been carefully crafted in a focus group. Her political stances are all formulated by her team and change \\(like her accent\\) depending on what part of the country she is talking to.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cThey are using hate speech and it must be shut down! This talking point and attitude is very common on today\u2019s college campuses and is everywhere on social media sites. Let me start this off by informing you that hate speech is a made up term and it does not exist. I know you are probably very upset with that one, but you will get over it\u2026. The term hate speech has been adopted by the left because it offers them a way to get around the requirements for violent speech.\u201d*\n\n*\u201cNow the people in the media will use the term \u201cdog whistle\u201d to turn the Presidents factual statement that most people would agree with into a negative. This is very easy to do, they will take the statement and show it. After they show it they will say this was a dog whistle to his base. This then opens the door for them to be able to interject a different meaning into what was said, and imply that like a dog whistle only certain people can hear it. So they can say \u201cWell he said this but what he really meant was this\u201d, or they can frame it as \u201cwell what he said sounds good but what his base really heard was all immigrants are bad\u201d. Now that the \u201cdog whistle\u201d version of the statement is out there then they are free to spend a large chuck of time discussing how bad the original statement is and then the entire premise of the original speech is replaced with speculation and negative inferences.\u201d* \n\n*\u201cLooking at all of the fake news stories, the retractions that get as little exposer as possible and the clear manipulation of the polling data, can you begin to understand why Trump supporters are not deterred when we see a \u201cdamning\u201d story of President Trump on the news? When the skew seems to always be negative Trump, do you ever take notice of it? We have. It is not that we burry our heads in the sand and ignore anything that could hurt President Trump, it is that time and time again we are presented with a news story and screamed at \u201chow can you support this man?\u201d* *Then the story proven to be miss leading or fake and then the cycle starts again. At what point will you be willing to break the cycle? Are you willing to accept that the media does have an anti\\-Trump bias and they try to influence your perspective of him and his supporters?\u201d*\n\n*\u201cImmediately following, let\u2019s call it the incident the media pounced and was calling Owens a \u201cfar right media personality\u201d, \u201cFar right activist\u201d, \u201cFar right personality\u201d, \u201cFar right figure\u201d, \u201cThe Toxic rights new African American Star\u201d, \u201cRight wing SJW\u201d, \u201cFar right YouTube star\u201d. Do you notice the pattern? Why is Candace Owns far right? Is voicing an opinion that follows the guidelines of any self\\-help book really far right? Or is Owens labeled far right because she is not on board with the ideals of the liberal side when it comes to minorities? Why is Owens simply not labeled conservative?\u201d*\n\n*\u201cMcCabe was a partisan; Comey has shown to be a partisan. I know your screaming \u201cHe is a Republican!\u201d guess what? I don\u2019t care if he is a Republican.* *So is McCain and Jeff Flake and numerous other republicans, and they would all be far happier right now if Hillary had won. Peter Strzok and Lisa Paige both high\\-ranking officials both anti Trump and pro Hillary. All of these people working at the top, all with Hillary leaning attitudes, all reporting to Lynch. Who was about as close to pro Hillary as you could get without physically being Hillary Clinton. Are you able to take a step back and look at this and think, \u201cyeah I suppose there could have been some conflict of interest.\u201d?\u201d*\n\n*\u201cThe night starts out with a high energy Clinton camp and a moderate Trump camp, the early results seemed to favor Clinton, and even Nate Silver started to adjust the percentage of a Clinton victory up. Everything seemed to be going as expected, but much like Nate Silvers hair as the night went on the messier it got.\u201d*\n\nSo you can see I cover a lot of topics and I referenced many topics that are currently fresh in peoples mind.\n\nThis is where I need your help. I have self\\-published this on amazon, and am requesting that you take the time to buy a copy and either have it ship straight to someone who you think could use it or hand deliver it yourself. If even 1/6th of this subs subscribers purchased the book it would reach thousands of people. It could be the biggest thing you could do to help conservatives win the midterms. This is why I have not made the book expensive. What I could also use your help with is to send the message as far as you can on social media. Post the link to the book and write about it, share the story. The more people who read the book the more people might question the Democratic Party.\n\nWith the wind of change blowing in our favor we can strike while the irons hot. If a big chunk of the liberal base is questioning their beliefs right around the midterms it will force the dems to waste resources to try to keep their voters, and it will put their candidates in a tough position defending their stances while boosting the MAGA Candidates. \n\nMy final note is that you will notice that this is a new account, and I do not have an author\u2019s name on the book. I did this because we all know how the extreme left and the media like to dox and attack those who dare speak up. I do not want to give the media or the left the chance to smear the book by smearing the author. I am looking at you CNN. Also it is because I tell some anecdotal stories in the book, I feel that the stories are similar throughout the nation and could easily be told by any one of us. Without having adding a face to the book then it leaves the message of the book to be interrupted as anyone could be writing it.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Looking\\-Past\\-Hysteria\\-Brief\\-Voted/dp/1717474527/ref=sr\\_1\\_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1525973665&amp;sr=1\\-1&amp;keywords=Trump\\+hysteria","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Looking Past the Hysteria, A Brief Look into Why We Voted Trump"}

However, over the past half year, I have come around to many traditionalist positions on marriage, hierarchy, and borders. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nA big question I have recently pondered is whether liberty is a means to an end or an end in and of itself.  I would like to view liberty as the highest virtue, I really would.  However, the libertarian argument drawn to its most logical conclusion is anarcho-capitalism - The line must be drawn somewhere.  **How can one view liberty as an end, only for Americans?**  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMany liberals profess that a dirt-poor Honduran who crosses the border possesses the same inalienable rights as an American.  **How does the right combat this idea?**  Logically, the statement follows if one endorses a universal application of inalienable rights and views the state as illegitimate.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAdditionally, **why do so many classical liberals and libertarians fail to acknowledge the libertinism which fills the libertarian vacuum?**  If one supports the individual's right to be gay married, give one's child hormone suppressors, and live a druggy lifestyle, will this family and the children grow up and vote Republican?  Or will they want more entitlements, more welfare, and more government programs?  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFurthermore, the fixation on the constitution has become banal.  We get it, the constitution is important.  But it's only as powerful as the American people.  If we legalize millions of illegals who are anti-gun and anti-free speech, the constitution will be irrelevant.  If the left stacks the court with anti-gunners, the constitution is dead.  In my view, the hyper-intellectual view of the constitution, liberty, and inalienable rights is hurting our movement.  We must recognize that the left does not hesitate to redefine and deracinate our fundamental institutions.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRepeating my main question, **is liberty an end in and of itself or a means to an end?**  My intent is not to present a false dichotomy but rather to view the ramifications of the liberal view our party has taken.

I used to be super liberal but then I realized it didn't make any sense and liberals were constantly contradicting themselves.\n\nAt my school, 95% of the teachers have a very liberal opinion. It's to the point that some of them center their lessons around liberal ideas and beliefs.\n\nMy history teacher does this a lot. We haven't really learned any history at all, just social justice stuff. We're currently in a unit talking about women's rights and the questions she asks are a bit annoying. Some are asking about the pay gap, abortion and other things. The teacher formats her questions so that you have to agree with her statements to get the points for the question. A question I answered today was \"how do you think the wage gap is wrong\" and I wrote that there is no wage gap and gave my proof on how it doesn't exist. I didn't get the points for the question. Someone pointed out in class that he thought abortion was wrong and the teacher said that he was an uneducated and uninformed bigot. She said after that if you don't agree that there is a wage gap you're a horrible person and you're denying the rights of women.\n\nThis isn't right. We shouldn't have teachers pushing their opinions on us, especially since they're in a position of authority. Teachers should take a more centered approach to teaching so then no ideas are forced upon the students and there's more of a neutral ground for discussion. Making us only be allowed to express a liberal point of view is limiting our freedom of speech. I want to be able to express myself freely without failing a class simply because my beliefs don't align with the teacher's.\n\nI've only had one good experience with a liberal teacher. He always took more of a neutral approach and saw all the arguments equally and actually listened to opinions that were different than his. He hardly ever brought his own opinions into the classroom unless someone asked what his stance was. It was an open and comfortable environment where I actually felt like my opinion was taken seriously.\n\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Schools/teachers are disgusting for forcing their political views on students and it should be illegal"}

I despised Obama but I couldn't stand the 'birthers' either when there were plenty of legitimate reasons to not like him as a President. But today's yellow journalism really rubbed me the wrong way with this shit sack of a posting:\n\nhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/dimitrios-pagourtzis-reportedly-idd-as-santa-fe-texas-shooting-suspect?yptr=yahoo\n\nIn it, they label this nutjob kid a neo Nazi because he had a German Iron Cross on a jacket he posted online. The fact that there is no context given past the kid saying it represents 'bravery doesn't deter the Beast though. Neither does the fact that the kid also had a Hammer and Sickle Soviet button, representing instead a far left ideology, either. My take is the kid wanted to be edgy and didn't realize what anything he wore represented.\n\n In another piece of shit article from Heavy, the fact that one of the kid's parents liked Dana Loesch on Facebook is somehow relevant-\nhttps://heavy.com/news/2018/05/dimitrios-pagourtzis/\nThat's right folks. Guilt by association. Guess its time to string Dana as well as any NRA members up.\n\nIt seems to me that lately that religion has been replaced by pure political ideology and its just as effective as it was during the Crusades at turning people into mindless zealots who will do ANYTHING to dehumanize someone who doesn't think exactly as they do. Thats the only reason I can think of for morally bankrupt articles like those above. So they can point and go 'See its only the far right thats violent and shoots up schools!' while ignoring the Soviet symbol. NRA member? Or even liked them on Facebook? Well guess you're pro school shooter. \n\nEarlier I saw a prevailing narrative that the kid was clearly alt right solely because he was white and liked guns. The blankets for the blanket statements get ever larger until they cover up anything and everyone the other side disagrees with. \n\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I always knew The Daily Beast was a leftist agenda pushing shit heel publication.

It\u2019s normally from this mentality that you\u2019ll hear people claiming the early church is pro socialist.  And while providing to those in need is something Christians are called to do, Paul makes pretty clear that idleness shouldn\u2019t be tolerated \n\n&gt; \u201cIn the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we command you, brothers and sisters, to keep away from every believer who is idle and disruptive and does not live according to the teaching you received from us. For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you, nor did we eat anyone\u2019s food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you. We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to offer ourselves as a model for you to imitate. For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: \u201cThe one who is unwilling to work shall not eat.\u201d\u201d\n\u202d\u202d[2 Thessalonians\u202c \u202d3:6-10\u202c \u202dNIV\u202c\u202c](http://bible.com/111/2th.3.6-10.niv)\n\nI think this the reason I\u2019ve never been a fan of UBI or welfare programs that don\u2019t prioritize finding employment.  This concept that \u201cif they can work, they should do so to earn their own way\u201d has been known for thousands of years. Yet even today, we have people saying maybe \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t earn our own way\u201d when others can do so for me.  (Keynesianism I\u2019m looking at you).\n\n  I know I\u2019m very much preaching to the choir here on this sub, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot today and thought it would be good to share.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Scripture to consider. 2 Thessalonians\u202c \u202d3:6-10\u202c \u202dNIV\u202c\u202c."}

{"author":"SignedUpForTrump","created_utc":1526843443,"num_comments":24,"score":15,"selftext":"In my opinion, there aren't any quick fixes. I see the gun violence problem as something that is a symptom of an injured culture. While overall gun violence is indeed going down, and has been for some time, it is true that school shootings are on the rise.\n\n\n**What is the conservative solution?**\n\n\nThe leftists are all about \"TAKE ACTION INSTEAD OF NRA MONEY\", etc, but the only actions that they propose fundamentally erode our constitutional rights. Their main proposal is general sorts of restrictions and gun bans, many of which would have not had an effect on any of the recent shootings (if not made some of them worse, since there wouldn't be a lawful armed citizen to respond near the schools).\n\n\nAnother proposed leftist solution is to increase funding for mental healthcare, or outright socialized single payer healthcare. I personally see that is another band-aid solution which is just socialized mental healthcare, unsustainable, would likely result in long wait times and lower quality of mental healthcare, and just another form of wealth redistribution.\n\n\n**But it is obvious that something needs to change.**\n\n\nWhat really angers me is that liberals often say that conservatives simply don't care. That is very far from the truth. Personally, I'm very upset about the prevalence of mass school shootings and think that something does need to be done. Even if you don't think that anything needs to be done by government, pragmatically is it a good idea to do SOMETHING so that our 2nd amendment doesn't get further eroded? \n\n * Is allowing teachers to carry a good idea? \n * What if they were provided extra secure biometric gun safes, yearly training, and a bonus for carrying? Deterrence seems like one of the most proven strategies in human history, whether militarily or nuclear. \n * Should there be armed police officers stationed at every school? \n * What about volunteer ex-police or ex-military, 10 or so per school in 5 hour shifts providing coverage during all school hours?\n * From a private standpoint, a non-profit could be formed and heavily screened volunteers could perhaps organize outside of the school perimeter (outside of the gun-free zone) to provide quick response time in the event of a shooting? This seems like my worst idea imo.\n * Schools can increase security with one point of entry, metal detectors, and armored doors.\n\n\n**How to fix the cultural issues?**\n\n * Government welfare replacing father figures.\n * Less religion, less common sense morality, more narcissism, more bullying. Less cohesiveness, less community.\n * Rampant promiscuous sex, again leading to fatherless children born outside of stable monogamy.\n\n\nI'm lost on how to address the cultural issues in the longer term. I see the \"good guys carrying guns\" as a bandaid for a long-term broken culture, broken families, etc, and I think it's sad that it's even necessary. I want my future children to feel safe even in the absence of guns. It is no longer safe to let children wander around the neighborhood, etc. What has changed and how can it be fixed?\n\nThese are just some ideas that I thought of. Do you have any?","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Discussion thread: What are conservative solutions to the mass school shootings trend?"}

I keep reading articles that suggest it is going to become the new California. Was hoping some conservative Colorado residents can give some insight? I just saw Boulder is banning \"Assault Rifles\". This was a shock since I imagined its people and representatives to be conservative. \n\nMy wife and I agreed California is no longer an acceptable state to raise our children and unless Travis Allen wins the race for Governor, we are gone. I am ready to inquire about a possible transfer from my accounting firm to one in Denver.\n\nIt appears in recent years Colorado is becoming more and more blue.

I believe she has values (somewhere in the very deep) just as much as I do, but she\u2019s grown up in a liberal environment where she was told what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. I was born into a totally non-political family, but I chose to become a conservative myself.\n\nWhen I talk to her about what she believes in, not trying to change her opinions, just to understand her logical process, she changes the topic immediately and sometimes goes as far as making weird noises to distract me. She agrees that every decision we make has to be logical, yet she doesn\u2019t want to think about even the possibility of something being the way she doesn\u2019t believe it to be. \n\nNow is not a problem as I don\u2019t care what she thinks as long as she doesn\u2019t go out and change genders or something, but later as we get more serious this will become a problem. I\u2019m also willing to change if she has any logical arguments that strikes me as sensible, but that is rather unlikely because I have thought about these issues for more than 6-7 years whereas she hasn\u2019t thought about it much.\n\nHow do I make her listen to me, and make her understand the logic and values that are behind conservatism without her running away from me? How should I go about it, what should I say? Has anyone accomplished this before? Thanks in advance.\n\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"On how to expose my liberal GF into conservative ideas"}

Both of these ideals are completely incompatible with the idea of Fascism, and yet many people, even others on the right, seem to have this idea that \"right-wing\" extremism is fascism. It seems to me that true \"right-wing\" extremism would be anarchy. I would say that there are only two \"right-wing\" systems, those being Capitalism and Republic Democracy.

{"author":"Esd11","created_utc":1527047008,"num_comments":0,"score":3,"selftext":"Considering all of the recent school shootings, being pro-gun has not been easy. Not that I ever felt like the being pro-gun was ever the wrong stance on the matter, but more on the fact that it is the right stance on the issue. I've had so many thoughts about the issue recently that I just needed to get them off my chest and start writing them down. Sorry if it's kinda all over the place, but I'm kinda just venting.\n\nBack in 1997 when the U.K. banned guns, the homicide rate was 12 per million people. Care to take a guess what it is today? It's still 12. People are so focused on the method of killing people instead of focusing on the root problem. My problem with the gun control debate is that there is so much focus on the guns themselves and less on the fact that people think it's okay to kill massive amounts of people. Ignoring the fact that most people probably could obtain a gun if they truly wanted to, if someone has come to terms with the fact that they are going to kill as many people as possible, they are going to find another means of accomplishing that whether you like that or not. It'd be like 30 bucks or so for me to rent a U-Haul that I could plow through a crowd of hundreds of people if I wanted to, but I'm not ever going to do that because I recognize that it is terrible and just blatantly evil.\n\nI'll use myself as an example for someone who can't legally purchase a gun in America. I'm only 17.  I have no street connections that would allow me to buy a gun from an illegal dealer nor do I have any way of accessing a gun in my house; However, I could easily just download Tor Browser, get a VPN, and get a gun shipped to my house from a website on the dark web without the government being able to track me(and I have pulled up one of these websites to prove a point before). If I can do it, then so can the sadistic maniac who has been planning to shoot up the school. Would I prefer if gun control was a real solution to solving the problem of violence? Of course I would. Seeing the videos of the shooting taken on the Parkland students phone and hearing the gunshots pop off one after another literally brought me to tears. But the bottom line is that you make policy based on reality, not on what you wish reality was. \n\nAnd to answer the inevitable question of \"So you're saying that we should do nothing?\", that's not what I'm saying at all. I'm trying to make the point that we shouldn't let our emotions get the better of us and make us rush into making decisions under the pretense that it's the righteous thing to do. The road to Hell was paved with good intentions. It's easy to see a kid with a gun shooting up a school and think that if you could just take that gun out of his hands then the problem would be solved. But then what are you left with? That same broken kid who had so much rage and frustration pent up rage inside of him is still there. In my opinion, this is the forgotten moral dilemma with the gun debate. What's even scarier than that is that I don't even believe that it is forgotten by the anti-gun crowd. More like subconsciously overlooked as a defense technique because it is much easier for us to believe that the gun is the problem rather than accept the harsh reality that we can't know who the next mass-shooter will be. \n\nIt's no coincidence as to why these mass shootings have happened mostly at schools despite schools not necessarily being the best place to achieve the highest body count. These kids feel neglected and powerless every day of their lives until they just can't stand it anymore. There's no greater feeling of power than having someone fear you, so they pick the places that they think will cause the most fear, fear from our perspective but empowerment from theirs. I think that the reason for all the sudden outrage over guns is the fact that we, as a society, had decided that this type of thing isn't supposed to happen to us. By us, I'm referring to the average everyday American. I mean sure, terrible things happen to regular people all the time. Your mom dies; your friend gets cancer; you lose your job. But those types of things are to be expected to an certain extent. We know mass murder is a real thing, but we can't comprehend that it could really happen to us because we are so distanced from that reality.\n\nIf you were to check the homicide rate in the United States, you'd be able to see that since the 90s, the homicide rate has been cut in half while the number of guns in the United States has doubled. So what's changed in that time period to have people believing that they are going to get shot in their school any day now because of the large amount of guns? The difference is the type of people who are getting shot. The majority of murders in America always have been a result of socioeconomic problems and gang violence. Most Americans can subconsciously separate themselves from these murders as they don't fit the character profile. It's not the way that humans preferably should think, but people see those in different life situations as \"others\" in a sense. For instance, I obviously value human life above any animal life, but I struggle to garner anywhere near as much emotion about starving kids in Africa as I do about my dog dying. It makes no sense, and I know it makes no sense, yet I can't control the way my emotions work. I value human life equally, but at the same time, how can I feel emotion to something I don't have a real connection to. Hundreds of inner city school kids can end up gunned down in the streets due to gang violence and America will only ever care about \"gun violence\" when it is middle or upper class kids getting shot. \n\nThe outrage that's come from the anti-gun people is selfish, non-rational, and coming from a place of fear, but as much as I resent the policies they are trying to put forward, I don't really know if I can blame them. It's hard to take a step back and think critically when you are in fear. It's the same reason why you can plan out exactly what to say to a girl you like and right as soon as you are about to speak, everything you had perfectly planned to say comes out sounding barely even intelligible. The media is also to blame for inciting this fear by making it seem like there is a school shooting epidemic. I wouldn't necessarily disagree too much, but the statistics show that there is still many more things to be scared of than school shootings. I don't feel the need to really touch on the media too much because I feel like everyone already understands what they are doing. My point is that people are so scared of the idea that something as horrific as a school shooting could happen to them so they want to stare at the sky and yell \"Do something!\" without even acknowledging the possible dangers of what they are asking to do. They conflate the lacking of an answer to the problem with the lack of desire to find an answer to that problem. The pro-gun stance is a hard pill to swallow considering recent events, but I think it's important to try and remember that truth isn't malleable no matter how much you wish that was not the case.\n\nI didn't intend to write all of this, much less share it with anyone. I had a lot of thoughts about the gun debate that I wanted to be able to preserve for myself really. Overall, I feel like after writing this all down I answered a lot of my own questions but didn't get anywhere closer to a solution. Not that I expected to find a solution anyways. I guess I was just looking for consolation in the fact that there is such thing as the inevitable and thats okay. \n\nEdit: Typo","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"My Thoughts on the Gun Debate"}

The new language is completely devoid of language addressing mental health or suicide prevention, and instead essentially creates a new version of a 209A \u2013 abuse prevention order \u2013 to be specifically used against gun owners. With the clearly false premise of mental illness being removed from this bill, the Massachusetts Legislature will now take a clear vote on a civil rights revocation and gun confiscation bill. With the real intent of the bill now made crystal clear by its own supporters.\n\nGOAL is urging the legislature to vote against a direct attack on our civil rights and instead refer the bill to the Joint Committee on Mental Health, Substance Abuse and Recovery where the underlying issues of mental health leading to suicide or violence should be duly considered.\n\nRecently the original bill\u2019s sponsor, Rep. Majorie Decker, was quoted in a State House News Service Article trying to separate her bill from mental health issues:-\u201cI think it\u2019s really important not to conflate mental health with what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d she said, calling ERPO \u201cone tool\u201d to limit suicide and mass casualty events.\u201d\n\nGun Owners\u2019 Action League was outraged when the House Committee on Ways and Means followed her lead by releasing a completely new version of H.3610 \u2013 redrafted as H.4517 \u2013 which was stripped of any language, or even premise, that dangerous mental illness was the purpose for an \u201cextreme risk order\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt appears that we were right all along when we questioned the substance of the original bill against the claims that it was about mental illness. This new draft is a complete bait and switch,\u201d said Jim Wallace Executive Director of GOAL. \u201cThis bill was originally sold as a bill to prevent suicides and protect the public against mass murders. Seeing that the current language is completely stripped of mental health conditions, it is now clear that this is merely a redrafted \u2018209A\u2019 restraining order designed to specifically attack gun owners only.\u201d\n\nGOAL is further disappointed by the lack of due process for this new bill. \u201cTwo days before the bill is to be voted on by members it is completely redrafted with no hearing or debate and with roughly 24 hours to read, review and file amendments,\u201d Wallace added. \u201cThis is not how discussions on Constitutional Civil Rights should occur.\u201d\n\nIn addition to removing the whole premise that the bill was about mental illness, the language also:\n\n \u2022 Removed the appeals process for the subject of the petition;\n\n \u2022 Does not provide a right to legal counsel;\n\n \u2022 Removed the standards of certain evidence and proof;\n\n \u2022 Essentially banned stun gun in violation of the Supreme Court of the United States;\n\n \u2022 Seemingly gives more rights to the petitioner than the accused;\n\n \u2022 Encourages local licensing authorities to invoke their \u201csuitability\u201d authority after the order expires. This will most likely guarantee that no one ever subjected to an ERPO will ever regain their civil rights.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Massachusetts lawmakers will be hearing on a new \"Extreme Risk Protection Order\" bill today, originally filed under a mental health bill, appears to be now restraining order oriented.

These ideas have nothing to do with being pro small government, which is the basis of the modern conservative movement. Conservatism values freedom, small governemnt, free market economics, capitalism etc. A true 'far right' activist would be liberterian or even anarcho capitalist.

Not White supremacy or white nationalism.\n\nIn fact, these so called \"far right\" individuals often campaign for disgusting and massive government programmes to deport people of colour, and often seek help from the state to enforce their extremist ideologies. How are such ideas far right? \n\nI'm a UK conservative, so despite me being almost certainly more liberal than most people here, I am still a capitalist and want the governemt to stay out of my life.

It took me a couple of days to find him, he was buried by Catholic charities. He now has a headstone.\n\nIn my quest to find dad, I found your wife. I was 10 when I last saw her, before she came to be back in your arm\u2019s embrace in 1993.\n\nI laid flowers on grandma\u2019s grave and placed a Russian and Polish flag on her grave as she was always fond of saying the Polish language was lower Russian. As I remembered her from times in my youth, she always made sure I ate, often telling me to \u201czaparkuj sw\u00f3j ty\u0142ek i zjedz!\u201d (Park your butt and eat). \n\nI looked to the left of her grave and for the first time in my life I found you. In reading your headstone, I learned you served the country I was born in, you fought in World War II for the United States Army and were lucky enough to make it home and become a veteran. Unfortunately you passed away 3 years before I was born.\n\nAs I look back on this day of memorial, I am reminded of your service to this country. Not only did you leave your homeland, you immigrated to this one and fought for it, you made it possible for me to be born and live in a country with the freedoms you only had for a very short period in your life.\n\nAs I met you that day, you taught me a profound lesson that I will never forget. Defending people\u2019s freedom comes from an act of unconditional love toward people you don\u2019t know.\n\nToday, the world is not as you left it. People exercise those freedoms, that you and your fellow service men safeguarded, in ways to destroy that which you fought for - they\u2019ve lost touch of what those freedoms mean and how one must fight to preserve them for future generations.\n\nAs I sit here today thinking of you and your grandson (named after you), that served this country, I am yet humbled by another lesson. The sacrifice one makes to defend freedom isn\u2019t for glory, martyrdom, or money, it\u2019s a legacy one leaves to forever remind others that there is never too steep a price to pay for the freedoms we have.\n\n\n\nKeep the legacies alive this Memorial Day - talk about those that served this country and that have left us, and be thankful for their unselfish sacrifice.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Letter To Grandpa"}
