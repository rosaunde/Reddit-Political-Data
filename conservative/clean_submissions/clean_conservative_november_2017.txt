If they paid their bill the way we pay our taxes, it would go something like this\u2026\n\n* The first four men (the poorest) would pay nothing\n\n* The fifth would pay $1\n\n* The sixth would pay $3\n\n* The seventh would pay $7\n\n* The eighth would pay $12\n\n* The ninth would pay $18\n\n* The tenth man (the richest) would pay $59\n\nSo, that\u2019s what they decided to do.\n\nThe ten men drank in the bar every day and seemed quite happy with the arrangement, until one day, the owner threw them a curve ball.\n\n\u201cSince you are all such good customers,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to reduce the cost of your daily beer by $20\u2033. Drinks for the ten men would now cost just $80.\n\nThe group still wanted to pay their bill the way we pay our taxes. So the first four men were unaffected. They would still drink for free. But what about the other six men ? How could they divide the $20 windfall so that everyone would get his fair share?\n\nThe bar owner suggested that it would be fair to reduce each man\u2019s bill by a higher percentage the poorer he was, to follow the principle of the tax system they had been using, and he proceeded to work out the amounts he suggested that each should now pay.\n\n* And so the fifth man, like the first four, now paid nothing (100% saving).\n\n* The sixth now paid $2 instead of $3 (33% saving).\n\n* The seventh now paid $5 instead of $7 (28% saving).\n\n* The eighth now paid $9 instead of $12 (25% saving).\n\n* The ninth now paid $14 instead of $18 (22% saving).\n\n* The tenth now paid $49 instead of $59 (16% saving).\n\nEach of the six was better off than before. And the first four continued to drink for free. But, once outside the bar, the men began to compare their savings.\n\n\u201cI only got a dollar out of the $20 saving,\u201d declared the sixth man. He pointed to the tenth man,\u201dbut he got $10!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right,\u201d exclaimed the fifth man. \u201cI only saved a dollar too. It\u2019s unfair that he got ten times more benefit than me!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d shouted the seventh man. \u201cWhy should he get $10 back, when I got only $2? The wealthy get all the breaks!\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d yelled the first four men in unison, \u201cwe didn\u2019t get anything at all. This new tax system exploits the poor!\u201d\n\nThe nine men surrounded the tenth and beat him up.\n\nThe next night the tenth man didn\u2019t show up for drinks so the nine sat down and had their beers without him. But when it came time to pay the bill, they discovered something important. They didn\u2019t have enough money between all of them for even half of the bill!\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**A few thoughts:**\n\nThis analogy is bang-on. I don't think Huckabee Sanders' delivery was very good, but it was nice to see this idea explained to the press and to the left (but I repeat myself).\n\nNaturally, the response across the MSM and Twitter was to berate her and to make all sorts of jokes about beer, but in all the coverage I've seen, I haven't actually seen anyone refute this analogy. People love to criticize and attack and insult, but most commentary I've seen on this story showcases that the left doesn't understand the analogy and/or has no rebuttal to it, so they just mock Huckabee Sanders and sweep the analogy under the rug.\n\nEither way, the mere fact that conservative principles like this are even seeing the light of day in the press is a massive improvement from the complete blackout of anything resembling conservatism that has existed in the mainstream over the past 30 years. I dislike a lot of things about the Trump administration, but things like this absolutely deserve to be lauded.\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Sarah Huckabee Sanders delivers the excellent Tax System Beer Analogy to the press"}

It's a 6 year old clip from Andrew Klavan and it's what got me into Klavan in the first place. It's so simple but so fundamental to everything that's wrong with leftism.\n\nThe foundation behind modern leftist/socialist ideology is the fact that the left doesn't understand what money is. They don't understand why it exists or what it represents. To the left, money is like a natural resource. There's a certain amount of it in the world, and if John has a lot, that means that Dave will only have a little. So to remedy this and make things \"fair\", we have to take some from John and give it to Dave.\n\nThat view is the root of all of leftist economic thought and it inherently doesn't understand what money is. This short Andrew Klavan video does a great job of explaining what money actually is and what it represents.\n\nI've gotta say, that video, along with [this clip from a couple years ago on The Ben Shapiro Show (39:45 to 44:50)](https://soundcloud.com/benshapiroshow/ep63) are two of the greatest economic lessons I've ever heard because they're so simple and so fundamental to the entire leftist-conservative economic debate. It's because so many people don't understand these basic lessons on money and on income inequality that we see so many people seduced by socialism and the language of \"fairness\". Because of that, I think these are two great starting points to teach our left wing friends about economics.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"This is the single most fundamental economic lesson that the left doesn't understand"}

{"author":"JohnSemmens","created_utc":1509752131,"num_comments":0,"score":5,"selftext":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: November 5, 2017 Edition\n\nClinton Assails Trump's \"Lack of Empathy\"\n\nFailed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton lambasted President Donald Trump for his \"lack of empathy\" following the New York City terror attack that killed eight people. \"Calling the unfortunate man who was driven to make this attack an 'animal' and demanding he face the death penalty was so cruel and callous,\" the former Secretary of State asserted. \"Where was the sympathy for a man wrested from his native Uzbekistan and thrust into an America teeming with the unbelievers that his faith commands him to kill?\"\n\nShe went on to contrast \"Trump's bloodthirsty desire for vengeance with the kindness and compassion shown by previous presidents. Bill had numerous opportunities to apprehend or take out Osama bin Laden, but restrained himself out of respect for Muslim cultural differences. Similarly, President Obama urged calm and forgiveness rather than violent retribution when our ambassador to Libya was accidentally killed.\"\n\n\"I suppose we shouldn't be surprised,\" Clinton said. \"I tried to warn voters that Trump's efforts to draw sharp distinctions between friends vs. enemies, criminals vs. victims, bad guys vs. good guys was the kind of thinking that ignored our common humanity. Rather than try to understand why Muslims feel compelled to kill us or why criminals seek a redistribution of wealth, Trump just condemns behavior he doesn't like and abuses the presidency to cram his backward, anti-progressive way of seeing things down our throats.\"\n\nIn related news, the editors at the New York Times advised people not to be alarmed when they hear someone screaming Allahu Akbar, calling it \"just an everyday phrase\" and the violence that frequently ensues immediately afterward as \"an easily misunderstood behavior. Those of us familiar with the Quran recognize that killing unbelievers is a sacred obligation for practitioners of Islam. It's as important for Muslims as confession is for Catholics. Its blanket condemnation by President Trump is a dangerous sign of the impending tyranny his Administration would impose against constitutionally protected freedom of religion in our country.\"\n\n2016 Democratic Primaries Rigged\n\nThis week, an excerpt from former Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile's forthcoming book asserted that the DNC conspired with Hillary Clinton to rig the Party's primary system to cheat Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders out of the presidential nomination. Ironically, Brazile lost her gig at CNN when Wikileaks revealed that she abetted the cheating by giving Hillary Clinton an advance peak at debate questions.\n\nBrazile expressed shock that in exchange for a $20 million cash payment, the DNC under her predecessor Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (Fla) sold controlling interest to Hillary Clinton. \"I don't know whether that was illegal, but it sure was unusual,\" Brazile wrote. \"Normally, control over the National Committee isn't transferred to a candidate until after the nomination is secured at the convention.\"\n\nClinton expressed surprise following the publication of Brazile's contention, saying \"from what I've heard, Donna hasn't been well. Perhaps a brain tumor has addled her thinking. The $20 million was a straightforward purchase of controlling interest much like many of the purchases made by Trump on his way to becoming a billionaire. Why is it okay for him to buy a hotel, but not for me to buy a political party? Trying to make my purchase look illegitimate is yet another example of the sexism that wrecked my campaign's chances.\"\n\nRep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez (D-IL) announced that Brazile's evidence will be added to the impeachment case he is building against President Trump. \"The dire threat that Mr. Trump's candidacy posed to America drove the most highly esteemed candidate that ever sought the office to have to resort to irregular tactics,\" Guti\u00e9rrez charged. \"Corrupting her virtue in such a manner is the highest crime imaginable.\"\n\nIn related news, in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sean Edgett, Acting General Counsel for Twitter, Inc., admitted that \"despite our efforts to stack the deck against him, Trump was able to effectively use Twitter to boost his campaign. We were able to suppress nearly 50% of the negative tweets about Clinton while allowing all the negative tweets about Trump to freely flow through our network. Clinton originated twice as many tweets as Trump did, but his tweets were re-tweeted twice as often. This type of clever and anarchic devolution of control from the company to its customers is a problem we are looking into.\"\n\nSessions Recuses Himself Again\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions told a small group of congressmen that he can't open an investigation nor name a special prosecutor to look into the corruption surrounding 2010's Uranium One deal because he has, once again, recused himself.\n\nAs Sessions explained, \"any person involved in any investigation must have no prior knowledge of the parties likely to be under scrutiny. Well, I have prior knowledge of Mrs. Clinton, President Obama, Robert Mueller, and James Comey\u2014each of whom has fingerprints all over that uranium thing. You see, it's like a juror being discharged if he knows any of the participants in a trial. Frankly, I don't see how anyone who's paid any attention to the news over the past eight years wouldn't have to recuse himself. That wouldn't seem to leave anyone available to take up the case. I know it seems stupid, but that's how our blind justice system is supposed to work.\"\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla), one of the congressmen who witnessed Sessions recusing himself characterized the AG's reasoning as \"lame and confused. If every prosecutor took such a stance no person of notoriety could ever be brought to justice. Sessions' passing of the buck to Rosenstein\u2014a lesser known person who may also be implicated in the Uranium One scandal\u2014is senseless and irresponsible.\"\n\nCandidate Discovers She's Black\n\nNoted Native-American fabulist Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) made an early bid to lock up the Black vote for a prospective 2020 presidential run by discovering that in addition to being part Cherokee she is also part Black.\n\n\"Just this last week I was told by a ninth cousin that our great-great-great grandmother was a slave who was serially raped by John Calhoun back in the 1850s and bore him more than a dozen children,\" Warren told a Black audience earlier this week. \"I am proud to say that I am one of the descendants of one of those children.\"\n\nThe Senator alleged that \"this bond of blood makes me especially qualified to represent those of us who have been oppressed because of the color of our skin. I wish that I would have known of my heritage earlier in my life. I could have opened some more doors for myself. But maybe the momentum from this later realization can open the door of the White House to this belatedly aware biracial woman.\"\n\nWarren pledged to \"focus on the continuing mistreatment of my people we see in our public institutions. I will work to remove math from the public school curriculum. Studies have shown that Blacks fail this subject at far higher rates than their share of the school population. In this age of computers it is a skill no longer needed to live in modern America. Likewise, I will work to free the Black men who disproportionately fill our prisons. Not acting white shouldn't be a crime. True diversity realizes the subjectivity of values and doesn't impose a moral code that is unsuitable for subsets of our society.\"\n\nRev. Al Sharpton, a member of the audience Warren was addressing professed himself to be \"tepidly optimistic\" about her candidacy. \"While I like her program I am not persuaded she would be an authentic spokesperson for Black liberation. I'm thinking maybe Michelle Obama would be a better vehicle for our message, though I do have my reservations concerning her demand that all men be neutered.\"\n\nIn related news, the mysterious appearance around the country of flyers saying \"it's okay to be white\" has struck terror among assorted minorities. Principal Renay Johnson of Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland, said \"the appearance of these flyers at our school is the most frightening incident I could have imagined ever happening here. It directly contradicts what we are trying to teach our students. The perpetrators must be hunted down and punished to full extent of what the law allows.\"\n\nNYC Jihadi Pleased with Himself\n\nNew York City attack suspect Sayfullo Saipov professed himself \"pleased with the outcome of my holy jihad against the unbelievers. I could have slain more if it hadn't been for the interference of the bus and getting shot by the police, but eight is a respectable count. Luckily, one of those I killed was a Jew. I will get extra benefits in paradise for that. If every Muslim could slay as many unbelievers as I have all religions except for Islam would be erased from the Earth.\"\n\nJohn Miller, deputy New York police commissioner for intelligence, said \"Saipov appears to have followed, almost exactly to a T, the instructions that Isis has put out.\" This observation inspired Mayor Bill de Blasio to declare \"today, I am a Muslim and I urge every resident of this great City to weigh the risks and rewards of not making the smarter and safer choice. Consider\u2014Bible, Quran\u2014these are just books with words that few people read. If you reject the Bible no priest or rabbi is likely to try to kill you. Meanwhile, you would be eliminating a Muslim's incentive to kill you. Once we are all nominally Muslim the madness can cease.\"\n\nShat al-Ott, Imam of the Paterson New Jersey radical mosque attended by Saipov, dismissed de Blasio's recommendation, calling it \"insincere. Islam is not a phony religion like Christianity. It requires full devotion, daily prayer, pilgrimages, and a willingness to fight for the spread of the faith. Anyone who is not willing to kill or risk being killed in this struggle is not a true Muslim and must be slain.\"\n\nIn related news, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif) dismissed President Trump's demand that we end the diversity visa lottery program that facilitated the terrorist's entry, and that of 23 of his family members, into the United States as \"absurd. The actions of Mr. Saipov demonstrate that the program is working like it's supposed to work. What could be more diverse than killing a random bunch of people out of religious devotion? The chances of finding a 'home-grown' American who would do such a thing are exceedingly slim. If Trump's effort toward excluding people of different faiths and customs is successful we would be isolated from world-wide trends that are reshaping what it means to live in modern times. Europe has adjusted to the new 'normal.' Do we really want to be left behind?\"\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: November 5, 2017 Edition"}

I have 2 years free because of my scores on a placement test, but I have to maintain a certain amount of credits and a 3.75 GPA. Here's the problem... I have an English professor who is incredibly biased. The guy is 75 years old and needs to retire. Every day he reads us an article from the New York Times and makes us write a summary about it. Of course the articles are usually political and we all know where the NYT stands on the political spectrum. \n\nSo far our assigned essay topics have been government (what does government do, could we live without government, etc), social class (prompt went into detail asking questions about how much your parents/family earns), and my favorite... \"are opt-out laws for immunizations a good thing?\". \n\nI love writing about controversial things. The problems are...\n\n1. My professor provides us with biased sources and corners us into writing what he wants to hear\n\n2. He goes on long rants about the \"facts\" in class which are actually just opinions\n\n3. He will provide us with an opinionated article, ask us OUR opinion, and call us wrong if we have an opinion he disagrees with\n\nIt's also notable that he once told us, \"Do not take a conservative, liberal, republican, or democratic stance on this, this is not political\", yet everything we have been made to write on is undeniably political. \n\nI could go on all day about the things he's said and done. I've kept all the papers he's handed back to me with his notes on them, and all the prompts he's given us. There are a couple reviews on him I found on a professor rating website that say the same thing... \"If you have a different opinion, don't expect a good grade.\"\n\n\nMy grades are okay in this class, but they could be better. I am getting points docked off for \"ignoring the facts of the articles\". I cannot drop or switch this class. I've considered just writing what he wants to hear but I can't bring myself to do it. \n\nAny advice?","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"How do I deal with a completely biased English professor?"}

{"author":"JohnSemmens","created_utc":1510370495,"num_comments":1,"score":2,"selftext":"Republicans Call for Moore to End Senate Run\n\nThe Washington Post's publication of allegations that Judge Roy Moore, the GOP candidate for Alabama's open senate seat, made improper sexual advances toward teen-age women in 1979 sparked calls for him to exit the race.\n\nSen. John McCain (R-Az) insisted that Moore \"should immediately step aside and allow the people of Alabama to elect a candidate they can be proud of. The allegations alone are disqualifying. Even if they turn out to be untrue the Senate is no place for a man about whom such charges are reported in a highly respected media outlet like the Post.\"\n\nIronically, McCain was the target of allegations that he was engaged in an extramarital affair with a Washington lobbyist during his ill-fated 2008 presidential campaign. He didn't step aside, something he now acknowledges \"may have been a mistake. It was before I had the nomination. If I had made an earlier exit I could have been replaced by a candidate voters could have been proud of.\"\n\nMcCain wasn't the only unsuccessful GOP presidential candidate to demand Moore drop out of the race. The 2012 Republican presidential nominee, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, echoed the Arizona Senator, saying that Moore's accuser's story of bringing a basket of food to her grandmother's house in the woods only to be confronted by the wolfish Moore \"has a ring of truth about it that I find very persuasive. I can't believe she would make up such a story.\"\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee has cut off funding for Moore's campaign. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) urged Sen. Luther Strange, who lost to Moore in the Republican primary, to run as a write-in candidate. Both of these moves would greatly increase the odds that Democrat Doug Jones will be Alabama's next US senator. \"No matter,\" says Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ken), \"I'd rather be in the minority than have to accept a tainted Republican as a senate colleague. We've been in the minority before. It's not so bad. There's a lot less pressure to get things done when you're in the minority, but the perks are all still there.\"\n\nIn related news, the US Senate has confirmed fewer of President Trump's executive and judicial nominees at this point of his term than the nominees of any previous president. Minority Leader Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) has exploited every available procedure to delay confirmation votes. The Senate's two-and-a-half day workweek is another contributing factor. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ken) lamented the slow pace, but asserted that \"long standing Senate procedures cannot be abandoned simply because they impede the efficient function of the government. The attraction of being a senator would be dissipated if it required a 40-hour work week or expeditious handling of matters up for action.\"\n\nNYC Mayor Taunts ISIS\n\nEmboldened by his reelection with 70% of the vote, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio brazenly mocked Islamic terrorists calling the recent attack that killed eight people \"feeble. There are more than eight million New Yorkers. It would take more than million attacks of the magnitude of that launched by Mr. Saipov to kill us all. Besides, five of the eight he killed were Argentinians\u2014not New Yorkers, per se.\"\n\n\"New Yorkers are resilient,\" the Mayor continued. \"Common criminals murder 300 people a year in our city, but our citizens don't quake in fear because they know their government is safe from murderous assault. I have bodyguards with me 24/7. So no matter how many ordinary inhabitants terrorists may succeed in killing my reign will go on.\"\n\nIn related news, the US Army is pondering whether to pay convicted deserter Pvt. Bowe Bergdahl $300,000 in back pay now that a judge has decided against sending him to prison. Army spokesman Col. Walter Wussier explained \"if he were going to prison he wouldn't need the money, but as a convicted traitor it will be hard for him to find a good job. A generous severance package would help him attain a decent lifestyle on the outside.\"\n\nSenator Reverses Herself on \"Rigged Primary\" Charge\n\nLast week Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) told CNN's Jake Tapper that the 2016 Democratic presidential primary was rigged to favor Hillary Clinton over her rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt). This week she reversed herself saying that \"I am persuaded that I was being manipulated into a false consciousness.\"\n\nThe chief \"persuader\" according to Warren was none other than Hillary Clinton. \"She reminded me that Bernie was the communist candidate and that the Russians would have had no incentive to rig the primaries against him,\" the Senator said. \"Once their efforts to secure the nomination for their 'mole' fell through they went to their back-up plan to undermine the person they most feared\u2014Secretary Clinton.\"\n\nA secondary factor in her changed opinion \"was Donna's admission that her 'tell all' book was largely fiction. Publishers demand that there be some 'blockbuster' revelations before they will fork over millions for the rights to your book. Political campaigns are mostly boring tales of envelope stuffing, meaningless sound bites, and pressing-the-flesh. An honest recount might interest professional historians, but they are a tiny minority of the book-buyers in America. Now that Donna has pocketed her advance she is free to revert back to the dull reality.\"\n\nSanders labeled Warren's contention \"ludicrous. First of all, in case Sen. Warren hasn't noticed, Russia isn't communist anymore. If they were going to meddle in the election it wouldn't have been to help me. I'm not the one who sold Russia uranium in exchange for multi-million dollar donations to my foundation. Second of all, what's so bad about communism? Hundreds of millions may have been oppressed and tens of millions killed, but the Soviet Union modernized a backward country and enforced an equality that we can only wish we had in America.\"\n\nNewly elected Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez contends that \"the DNC actually did less than it could have on Hillary's behalf. Back in 2008, the Party brought in thugs to frighten Republican voters away from some polling places. The Party didn't do that for Hillary. Perhaps we were overconfident she would win without the full array of normal procedures. It was a mistake that has cost Democrats dearly. And one we may have to live with for quite awhile.\"\n\nThe corruption within the Democratic Party is so bad that long-time Party strategist Doug Schoen urged major change. \"The entire Democratic Party stinks from the head down, the whole process,\" he complained. \"The rigged primary, the Uranium One payoffs, the Trump dossier\u2014it's a mess. We need a special prosecutor to look into this.\"\n\nRep. Al Green (D-Tex), though, blamed Trump for the \"mess\" saying that \"his incitement of white supremacy, sexism, bigotry, hatred, xenophobia, race-baiting, and racism is what has driven the Democratic Party to undertake these desperate measures aimed at thwarting his tyranny. Until this man is impeached and removed from office we will continue to see riots in the streets, unending sexual harassment, and the persecution of minorities.\"\n\nIn related news, flush with the success of what the Washington Post called their \"vile and despicable\" ad on behalf of Democrat Ralph Northam in the Virginia governor's election, the Latino Victory Fund vowed to \"spread the message far and wide\" in future electoral contests. Crist\u00f3bal Alex, Latino Victory Fund president, justified the scurrilous ad, calling it \"payback for Republican ads maligning MS-13, claiming it is a criminal gang.\"\n\nCalifornia NAACP Wants to Get Rid of the \"Star Spangled Banner\"\n\nThe California chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is lobbying the State Legislature to remove the Star Spangled Banner as the country's national anthem. California NAACP President Alice Huffman credited former National Football League player Colin Kaepernick with \"drawing attention to just how racist, pro-slavery, anti-black the song is.\"\n\nWhile the words of the song seem to focus on fighting for freedom, Huffman contended that \"the opening line asking whether Jose can see both belittles the eyesight of our Latino friends and singles them out for unknown, but probably racist reasons.\"\n\nRep. Danny Davis (D-Ill) lauded the NAACP initiative and pointed out that \"the lack of mention for this country's foremothers and foresisters in the song is an unforgivable sexist slight, too. You know, former President Obama raised this issue back when he first ran for president. He objected to the bellicose content of the song\u2014all the bombs bursting and such. He suggested at that time that we adopt the song 'I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing' as our anthem. I think that was very prescient of him and would be happy to introduce the legislation needed to accomplish this.\"\n\nSenate Tax Legislation May Delay Corporate Tax Cut\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed concerns that the House proposal to make corporate tax cuts take place immediately \"has sparked apprehension among our Democratic colleagues that such precipitous action would put their Party's candidates at an unfair disadvantage during the 2018 election. They fear that the repatriation of corporate money currently held outside the country that such a tax cut would initiate would lead to too big of an increase in investment and jobs and that it would essentially ensure a Republican sweep of all competitive races for House and Senate seats.\"\n\n\"Rather than tilt the playing field against our colleagues we are considering postponing the planned corporate tax cuts until 2019,\" McConnell said. \"That would put any potential economic resurgence into a period beyond the date of the election and remove the unfair advantage it could give Republicans in the minds of the voters.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) was effusive in his praise for what he called \"Mitch's extraordinary devotion to fair play. That he would turn away from using his Party's power to ram through a measure that could guarantee his Party remained the majority is the kind of selflessness you rarely see in politics.

This is an article that he was forced to read and answer questions about. They aren't even trying to be subtle about it:...\n\n\nAUSTIN, Texas \u2013 Some Hispanic students have a hard time getting a college education. Now, states are looking at ways to help them.\nManuel Ramirez is an example of how difficult it can be.\nHis parents brought him to the United States illegally from Mexico. He was 8 years old. They cleaned houses and did odd jobs. They made just enough to live on. When he grew up, they could not afford to pay $10,000 for him to go to the University of Texas at Austin.\nTo earn extra money, Manuel worked different jobs. He colored people's hair, for instance. He built fences at a ranch.\nLast year, Ramirez graduated from college. He now has a job organizing workers.\nCritics Dislike Proposed Law\nRamirez is fighting to prevent a change in a Texas law. The proposed law would make college more expensive for people who came here illegally from other countries. Right now, Texas residents pay less money for college than residents of other states. Under the bill, illegal immigrants would not get the lower price.\nRamirez said the fight is not just for immigrants. Everyone should be able to afford college. Texas needs \"to produce great minds and give them a job.\"\nThe share of the U.S. population that is Hispanic is growing larger. But in Texas and 24 other states, whites are at least twice as likely as Hispanics to have college degrees. States are beginning to see that difference as a serious problem.\nBetter Jobs For Those With College Degrees\nMore jobs are being created for people with college degrees. At the same time, there are fewer jobs for high school graduates. The situation is even worse for people who dropped out of school.\nThe problem is growing across the country, said Steve Murdock. He is a professor at Rice University. Murdock has said for years that Texas and other states must do a better job of educating minorities, especially Hispanics. Otherwise, he said, companies will find workers in other countries.\nRepublican Governor Greg Abbott talked about the issue this month. Texas must keep creating new jobs, he said. \"We must become the leader at educating our children.\"\nTwo months ago, a Texas business group rented a sign. It said graduation rates at the University of Texas at San Antonio were too low. Almost half the students at the school are Hispanic.\nSeeing, And Filling, A Need\nMeanwhile, two companies saw they needed more college-educated workers. The companies were aircraft makers Lockheed Martin and Boeing. They started a program that lets local students work toward their college degrees.\nTeri Albrecht works with students at the University of Texas at Austin. Albrecht said applying for college can be especially tough for immigrants. Many immigrants find out then that they were brought to the country without permission. Their parents never told them. The parents wanted to \"protect their children,\" Albrecht said.\nU.S.-born Hispanic college students face unusual money problems. They need advice and help from those who are doing well in school, said Michael Soto. He is a professor at Trinity University in San Antonio. Soto grew up near the Mexican border. He has degrees from Stanford and Harvard universities.\n\u201cWe know what works,\" Soto said. \"There are a number of proven programs.\u201d","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Public Schools are nothing more than Liberal Voter training camps these days"}

I'm not for this. I'm not going to try to say it's some conspiracy against white people or something, that'd be ludicrous, but affirmative action in how it is right now just doesn't work.  Plus, it doesn't address the disproportionate rate of poverty among communities of color (or the root, which is businesses not wanting to go there/people not wanting to hire because they are community of color) - poverty has a significant impact on academic abilities. It doesn't address crime rates, seeing how higher crime doesn't exactly lend itself to learning (end the violence marches and scared straight programs are more popular than the BLM organization, by the way). It doesn't address the bias against students of the \"wrong\" color or \"bad\" income group being discriminated against in school by teachers who place lower standards for them (its a fact that higher expectations lead to higher achievements - when schools were segregated by law, black-only schools led by black teachers were stricter than white schools, although then it was partially because anti-black bias led to things like lynching so there was no room for mistake. Many charter schools take this approach, and in fact increase academic achievements from low-income students and students of color). It doesn't even do what it is supposed to!","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Slate and the Atlantic, both Liberal, are scathing on Affirmative Action (Long reading)"}

While I believe many of these guys are probably guilty, it really pains me to see the media being the judge, jury and executioners. These white men are all being crucified without any sort of due process. Lives, careers, and reputations being absolutely sullied by nothing more than allegations. It always starts with one, but then within hours we have dozens of allegations coming up against dozens of men. Its scary how easy it is to ruin a man with just an accusation. The leftists eating their own is an interesting subplot that I dont really understand, but I'm almost ok with that because I feel they almost deserve it because of their past irresponsible comments. However, these guys are just as innocent until proven guilty as anyone else. God help us! I am glad I am not a celebrity, who can be completely destroyed by a false accusation from a disgruntled ex.  Social media is destroying our society. My last thing, I think woman who are screaming \"sexual assault\" for being slapped on the ass by a man is a disgrace to all the wonman out there who have legitimately been assaulted. Yes it is in horribole taste and has no place in our society, but it greatly undermines the true victims who have been beaten and raped. They are the real victims.\n\nPlease give me your thoughts,,, I'd like to hear what other people have to say on these matters\n\nThanks for reading!\n2fly","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Witch hunt of the week."}

{"author":"JohnSemmens","created_utc":1511041945,"num_comments":1,"score":14,"selftext":"Senator Seeks Meeting with FBI Informant\n\nA lawyer representing Sen. Diane Feinstein (Calif)\u2013the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2013requested the opportunity to meet privately with former FBI informant, William Campbell. Campbell helped the FBI chronicle bribery, kickbacks and money laundering connected to the Uranium One scandal.\n\nVictoria Toensing, Campbell's attorney, agreed to meet, but questioned the time and location suggested by Feinstein's lawyer, saying that \"a midnight meeting at Fort Marcy Park strikes me as unusually inconvenient, probably unwise, and potentially dangerous.\"\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, called Feinstein's request \"premature. Mr. Campbell will be testifying before the entire Committee. Every senator on the committee will have an opportunity to question him. If any senator has additional questions afterward a one-on-one meeting in a more conventional time and location can be arranged.\"\n\nIn related news, Hillary Clinton insists that \"any effort by the Department of Justice or Congress to investigate me is an abuse of power. All of the actions I took while Secretary of State are exempt because of a concept called 'sovereign immunity.' Namely, every agent of government is free to carry out his or her duties without interference and second-guessing by outsiders.\" Clinton pointed out that \"this isn't the first time that my enemies have tried to drag me to court. But let me remind you that in so may instances fate has intervened to eliminate my accusers before any harm could be done.\"\n\nUpdate on Sexual Allegations Sweeping the Country\n\nThe rising tide of allegations of sexual harassment that swept through Hollywood is now inundating politics and moistening persons of varying ideological proclivities.\n\nSo far, eight women have accused Alabama Republican senatorial candidate Roy Moore of sexually inappropriate behavior dating back several decades. The most serious accusation alleging attempted rape was made by Beverly Young Nelson. The veracity of this allegation was cast into some doubt by Nelson's own lawyer\u2014Gloria Allred\u2014who refused to attest to the validity of the signed high school yearbook offered in support of Nelson's claim. As she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer \"I haven't asked my client whether the 'Roy Moore' signature is genuine. Even if it is a forgery, though, that wouldn't prove that he didn't try to rape her.\"\n\nMoore has demanded that the yearbook be examined by an independent handwriting expert to assess whether it is or isn't a forgery. To date, Allred has declined to submit the book for forensic examination, insisting that \"the time isn't yet ripe for such a step. My client's credibility shouldn't be held hostage to the admittedly imperfect art of handwriting analysis.\"\n\nWhile a number of leading Republicans have asserted that Moore must give up his run for the Senate because of the allegations, sexual abuse allegations against sitting Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn) have inspired only a call for an \"ethics\" investigation from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"Sen. Franken is already a colleague and, as such, is entitled to certain privileges and immunities,\" McConnell contended. \"We need hard evidence before we jump the gun on him.\"\n\nInterestingly, there is a photo of Franken fondling the breasts of his accuser while she slept. Kasie Hunt, the Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News, brushed aside the photo evidence saying that \"since the woman was asleep I can't see that any real harm was done to her. I mean. Franken is well known for his crude sense of humor. Leeann is only degrading herself by bringing this up after so many years have passed.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif) revealed that Congress has a slush fund that has paid out $15 million over the last 20 years to \"hush up incidents of harassment and abuse carried out by members of congress. The ironically named Office of Compliance (OOC) essentially protects the offenders by forcing victims to sign nondisclosure agreements as a condition of getting a settlement. Leadership's notion that mandating sexual harassment training for all lawmakers and staff will solve the problem is ludicrous. Congress is purportedly the elite of our democratic society. How could any member not already know that fondling, groping, intimidating, or sexually assaulting is wrong?\"\n\nIn related news, disgraced former purveyor of fake news Dan Rather absolved former President Bill Clinton from \"any blame that might attach to his alleged improper behavior. Even if he did rape Broadderick, so much time has passed that she is a hideous old woman now. She is not the kind of person that a man of sophistication and taste like President Clinton could be seriously suspected of assaulting.\"\n\nDems Introduce Articles of Impeachment\n\nThis week Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) introduced Articles of Impeachment against President Donald Trump, saying that \"this usurper must be held accountable for his high crimes and misdemeanors before he drags the country into the hellish tyranny he has designed for America.\" The list of offenses includes...\n\n\"On election night in 2016, rather than gracefully and rightly conceding to the winner of the popular vote, Donald Trump exploited a the loophole of the Electoral College to unfairly declare himself president,\" Cohen charged. \"Millions were summarily disenfranchised. Women and minorities were especially hard hit.\"\n\n\"He continues to steadfastly refuse to release his income tax returns, relying on the so-called legal right to privacy that the IRS law allows to every taxpayer,\" Cohen complained. \"Privacy is a bourgeois conceit that has no rightful place in a socially progressive society. It is not up to the individual to decide what is to be private. That is a decision belonging to the government.\"\n\n\"In defiance of the norms under which members of government obtain wealth by trading on their positions of power, Trump continues to hold an ownership share in capitalistic enterprises that reap their profits from offering services for which customers voluntarily pay,\" Cohen revealed. \"This raises a 'red flag' that suggests he cannot be trusted to act in the best interests of the governing class.\"\n\n\"And just last week he couldn't give a speech without pausing in the middle to drink from a bottle of water,\" Cohen said. \"No other president has ever done this. Is he merely uncouth? Or does he have a serious medical problem? Either way his fitness to hold the office must be questioned.\"\n\n\"Finally, he has cast aspersions on the media, repeatedly referring to it as 'fake news,' thus undermining the credibility of our nation's foremost arbiters of truth,\" Cohen concluded. \"Thomas Jefferson warned us against this threat to our freedoms. Those who question the media strike at the very heart of our constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press. If the people lose faith in the media they will be set adrift in a sea of cacophonic and disparate opinion with no reliable guide to correct thought.\"\n\nIn related news, Attorney General Jeff Sessions told the House judiciary committee that \"there is not enough evidence to support a special counsel to investigate Hillary Clinton.\" He differentiated Clinton's situation from that of President Trump by pointing out \"in the case of Trump and the Russians there was the GPS Fusion dossier that provided a sound foundation of evidence for appointing Mueller to probe further. There is no similar dossier on Mrs. Clinton.\"\n\nSocialist Students Reject Food Drive Challenge\n\nAt Kent State University in Ohio, two left-wing student clubs\u2014the Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) and the Socialist Collective (SC)--rejected a challenge from Young Americans for Liberty (YAL) and Turning Point USA (TPUSA) to see which organization could gather the most food for poor people in a campus-wide canned food drive.\n\nYDSA chapter co-chair, Ethan Comeriato, explained \"While in the short run the food drive would benefit the public our participation would detract from our long-term goal of helping the poor through socialism. The flaw in all charitable giving is that the giver has the option to refuse. In the progressive America toward which we are working the option to refuse will be replaced by government control of all resources. Rather than having to rely on individual generosity to care for the less well off, government experts will dole out the necessities of life for the collective benefit of all.\"\n\nComeriato also labeled the challenge \"a capitalistic trick aimed at supporting the false consciousness of individualism. By making the collection of food a competition it obscures the reality that the poor have every right to seize the food they need from those who have a surplus. This is a dangerous idea spewed by dangerous organizations. If the challenge entailed breaking into the homes of the rich and confiscating food for distribution to the poor we'd be all-in.\"\n\nYAL chapter president, Kevin Cline, expressed his disappointment of the rebuff, saying \"the purpose of our challenge was to extend an olive branch to our ideological counterparts on campus, open up a mutual dialogue and friendly channels of communication, and accomplish some good for our community in the process.\"\n\n\"Socialists cannot be friendly with capitalists,\" Comeriato replied. \"These exploiters of the working class must be dispossessed and punished for their crimes against humanity. As Marx proved so long ago, those who resist the revolution for social justice must be reeducated or liquidated, as the people's tribunals will decide. There is no point to a dialogue with Cline or his ilk when it is people like him that we mean to publicly hang as an example to everyone that we are serious about transforming our country.\"\n\nDems Demand Free Abortions for Illegals\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-WA) and 15 other Democratic senators signed a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) assailing a Trump Administration policy denying illegal unaccompanied minors access to abortion.\n\n\"Long ago the Supreme Court decreed that it is every woman's constitutional right to abort her unwanted child,\" the letter said. \"The Administration's attempt to get around the Court's decree by asserting it doesn't apply to females in the country illegally is reprehensible. Their argument that providing free abortions to illegal immigrants would only encourage more illegal immigration is irrelevant. Providing a refuge for those seeking abortions outlawed in the Latin American tyrannies from which these women are escaping upholds the longstanding traditions of our country as a beacon of freedom.\"\n\nSen. Murray elaborated on the letter, insisting that \"laws against using taxes to fund abortions are obviously unconstitutional. What good is a theoretical right to an abortion if you can't afford to pay for it? The whole point of an impoverished female coming to America to abort her unwanted child would be completely thwarted if the government can refuse to pay for it. In light of recent scientific findings showing that having children is harming the planet, it would be insane for us not to fund every possible abortion we can before it is too late.\"\n\nIn related news, another new constitutional right was recently announced by Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley who asserted that \"the Constitution's 'pursuit of happiness' clause says that Army personnel have a constitutional right to change their gender and the government has an obligation to provide the medical and financial resources to see that this right is fulfilled.\"\n\nBiden's Bizarre Gun Control Logic\n\nDespite the availability of an AR-15 to Stephen Willeford being a crucial factor that helped him bring and end to the Sutherland Springs, Texas church massacre, former Vice-President Joe Biden adamantly asserted that \"this is the type of gun no one should be allowed to have.\"\n\n\"I know some will argue that Willeford saved lives by shooting the guy who was killing dozens of people in that church,\" Biden acknowledged. \"But we've got to look at the bigger picture and be willing to make the sacrifices that promote the greater good. If Willeford hadn't had the AR-15 the killer might've shot a few more people. On the other hand, widespread ownership of AR-15s poses a much more serious threat that anti-government types could mount a dangerous resistance to government authority. Eliminating this greater danger by confiscating weapons like the AR-15 is clearly the better policy.\"\n\nThe editors at the Boston Globe newspaper took an even more extreme view than the former Veep and demanded that all 300 million privately held guns be confiscated. \"One of the commonly overlooked advantages of the former Soviet Union's gun control policies is that when only government authorities have legal access to firearms the ability of private citizens to shoot one another is drastically curtailed,\" the editors observed. \"Perhaps it's time for us to accept a sinilar trade-off and give up our freedom to own guns in exchange for the freedom to not be shot by our fellow citizens.\"\n\nIn possibly related news, a former Secret Service agent assigned to guard Biden during his vice-presidency claims that agents frequently had to intervene to protect women from being fondled by him. \"He'd get 'touchy-feely' at every opportunity,\" the agent recalled. \"We couldn't avert all the groping and would later cringe when we saw the evidence captured in photos of official events he attended. I mean, he doesn't have the same senility escape clause employed by former President Bush and his demented 'Copafeel' magician joke.\"\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: November 19, 2017 Edition"}

{"author":"tehForce","created_utc":1511060166,"author":"JohnSemmens","created_utc":1511041945.0,"num_comments":1,"score":14,"selftext":"Senator Seeks Meeting with FBI Informant\n\nA lawyer representing Sen. Diane Feinstein (Calif)\u2013the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2013requested the opportunity to meet privately with former FBI informant, William Campbell. Campbell helped the FBI chronicle bribery, kickbacks and money laundering connected to the Uranium One scandal.\n\nVictoria Toensing, Campbell's attorney, agreed to meet, but questioned the time and location suggested by Feinstein's lawyer, saying that \"a midnight meeting at Fort Marcy Park strikes me as unusually inconvenient, probably unwise, and potentially dangerous.\"\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, called Feinstein's request \"premature. Mr. Campbell will be testifying before the entire Committee. Every senator on the committee will have an opportunity to question him. If any senator has additional questions afterward a one-on-one meeting in a more conventional time and location can be arranged.\"\n\nIn related news, Hillary Clinton insists that \"any effort by the Department of Justice or Congress to investigate me is an abuse of power. All of the actions I took while Secretary of State are exempt because of a concept called 'sovereign immunity.' Namely, every agent of government is free to carry out his or her duties without interference and second-guessing by outsiders.\" Clinton pointed out that \"this isn't the first time that my enemies have tried to drag me to court. But let me remind you that in so may instances fate has intervened to eliminate my accusers before any harm could be done.\"\n\nUpdate on Sexual Allegations Sweeping the Country\n\nThe rising tide of allegations of sexual harassment that swept through Hollywood is now inundating politics and moistening persons of varying ideological proclivities.\n\nSo far, eight women have accused Alabama Republican senatorial candidate Roy Moore of sexually inappropriate behavior dating back several decades. The most serious accusation alleging attempted rape was made by Beverly Young Nelson. The veracity of this allegation was cast into some doubt by Nelson's own lawyer\u2014Gloria Allred\u2014who refused to attest to the validity of the signed high school yearbook offered in support of Nelson's claim. As she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer \"I haven't asked my client whether the 'Roy Moore' signature is genuine. Even if it is a forgery, though, that wouldn't prove that he didn't try to rape her.\"\n\nMoore has demanded that the yearbook be examined by an independent handwriting expert to assess whether it is or isn't a forgery. To date, Allred has declined to submit the book for forensic examination, insisting that \"the time isn't yet ripe for such a step. My client's credibility shouldn't be held hostage to the admittedly imperfect art of handwriting analysis.\"\n\nWhile a number of leading Republicans have asserted that Moore must give up his run for the Senate because of the allegations, sexual abuse allegations against sitting Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn) have inspired only a call for an \"ethics\" investigation from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"Sen. Franken is already a colleague and, as such, is entitled to certain privileges and immunities,\" McConnell contended. \"We need hard evidence before we jump the gun on him.\"\n\nInterestingly, there is a photo of Franken fondling the breasts of his accuser while she slept. Kasie Hunt, the Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News, brushed aside the photo evidence saying that \"since the woman was asleep I can't see that any real harm was done to her. I mean. Franken is well known for his crude sense of humor. Leeann is only degrading herself by bringing this up after so many years have passed.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif) revealed that Congress has a slush fund that has paid out $15 million over the last 20 years to \"hush up incidents of harassment and abuse carried out by members of congress. The ironically named Office of Compliance (OOC) essentially protects the offenders by forcing victims to sign nondisclosure agreements as a condition of getting a settlement. Leadership's notion that mandating sexual harassment training for all lawmakers and staff will solve the problem is ludicrous. Congress is purportedly the elite of our democratic society. How could any member not already know that fondling, groping, intimidating, or sexually assaulting is wrong?\"\n\nIn related news, disgraced former purveyor of fake news Dan Rather absolved former President Bill Clinton from \"any blame that might attach to his alleged improper behavior. Even if he did rape Broadderick, so much time has passed that she is a hideous old woman now. She is not the kind of person that a man of sophistication and taste like President Clinton could be seriously suspected of assaulting.\"\n\nDems Introduce Articles of Impeachment\n\nThis week Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) introduced Articles of Impeachment against President Donald Trump, saying that \"this usurper must be held accountable for his high crimes and misdemeanors before he drags the country into the hellish tyranny he has designed for America.\" The list of offenses includes...\n\n\"On election night in 2016, rather than gracefully and rightly conceding to the winner of the popular vote, Donald Trump exploited a the loophole of the Electoral College to unfairly declare himself president,\" Cohen charged. \"Millions were summarily disenfranchised. Women and minorities were especially hard hit.\"\n\n\"He continues to steadfastly refuse to release his income tax returns, relying on the so-called legal right to privacy that the IRS law allows to every taxpayer,\" Cohen complained. \"Privacy is a bourgeois conceit that has no rightful place in a socially progressive society. It is not up to the individual to decide what is to be private. That is a decision belonging to the government.\"\n\n\"In defiance of the norms under which members of government obtain wealth by trading on their positions of power, Trump continues to hold an ownership share in capitalistic enterprises that reap their profits from offering services for which customers voluntarily pay,\" Cohen revealed. \"This raises a 'red flag' that suggests he cannot be trusted to act in the best interests of the governing class.\"\n\n\"And just last week he couldn't give a speech without pausing in the middle to drink from a bottle of water,\" Cohen said. \"No other president has ever done this. Is he merely uncouth? Or does he have a serious medical problem? Either way his fitness to hold the office must be questioned.\"\n\n\"Finally, he has cast aspersions on the media, repeatedly referring to it as 'fake news,' thus undermining the credibility of our nation's foremost arbiters of truth,\" Cohen concluded. \"Thomas Jefferson warned us against this threat to our freedoms. Those who question the media strike at the very heart of our constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press. If the people lose faith in the media they will be set adrift in a sea of cacophonic and disparate opinion with no reliable guide to correct thought.\"\n\nIn related news, Attorney General Jeff Sessions told the House judiciary committee that \"there is not enough evidence to support a special counsel to investigate Hillary Clinton.\" He differentiated Clinton's situation from that of President Trump by pointing out \"in the case of Trump and the Russians there was the GPS Fusion dossier that provided a sound foundation of evidence for appointing Mueller to probe further. There is no similar dossier on Mrs. Clinton.\"\n\nSocialist Students Reject Food Drive Challenge\n\nAt Kent State University in Ohio, two left-wing student clubs\u2014the Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) and the Socialist Collective (SC)--rejected a challenge from Young Americans for Liberty (YAL) and Turning Point USA (TPUSA) to see which organization could gather the most food for poor people in a campus-wide canned food drive.\n\nYDSA chapter co-chair, Ethan Comeriato, explained \"While in the short run the food drive would benefit the public our participation would detract from our long-term goal of helping the poor through socialism. The flaw in all charitable giving is that the giver has the option to refuse. In the progressive America toward which we are working the option to refuse will be replaced by government control of all resources. Rather than having to rely on individual generosity to care for the less well off, government experts will dole out the necessities of life for the collective benefit of all.\"\n\nComeriato also labeled the challenge \"a capitalistic trick aimed at supporting the false consciousness of individualism. By making the collection of food a competition it obscures the reality that the poor have every right to seize the food they need from those who have a surplus. This is a dangerous idea spewed by dangerous organizations. If the challenge entailed breaking into the homes of the rich and confiscating food for distribution to the poor we'd be all-in.\"\n\nYAL chapter president, Kevin Cline, expressed his disappointment of the rebuff, saying \"the purpose of our challenge was to extend an olive branch to our ideological counterparts on campus, open up a mutual dialogue and friendly channels of communication, and accomplish some good for our community in the process.\"\n\n\"Socialists cannot be friendly with capitalists,\" Comeriato replied. \"These exploiters of the working class must be dispossessed and punished for their crimes against humanity. As Marx proved so long ago, those who resist the revolution for social justice must be reeducated or liquidated, as the people's tribunals will decide. There is no point to a dialogue with Cline or his ilk when it is people like him that we mean to publicly hang as an example to everyone that we are serious about transforming our country.\"\n\nDems Demand Free Abortions for Illegals\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-WA) and 15 other Democratic senators signed a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) assailing a Trump Administration policy denying illegal unaccompanied minors access to abortion.\n\n\"Long ago the Supreme Court decreed that it is every woman's constitutional right to abort her unwanted child,\" the letter said. \"The Administration's attempt to get around the Court's decree by asserting it doesn't apply to females in the country illegally is reprehensible. Their argument that providing free abortions to illegal immigrants would only encourage more illegal immigration is irrelevant. Providing a refuge for those seeking abortions outlawed in the Latin American tyrannies from which these women are escaping upholds the longstanding traditions of our country as a beacon of freedom.\"\n\nSen. Murray elaborated on the letter, insisting that \"laws against using taxes to fund abortions are obviously unconstitutional. What good is a theoretical right to an abortion if you can't afford to pay for it? The whole point of an impoverished female coming to America to abort her unwanted child would be completely thwarted if the government can refuse to pay for it. In light of recent scientific findings showing that having children is harming the planet, it would be insane for us not to fund every possible abortion we can before it is too late.\"\n\nIn related news, another new constitutional right was recently announced by Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley who asserted that \"the Constitution's 'pursuit of happiness' clause says that Army personnel have a constitutional right to change their gender and the government has an obligation to provide the medical and financial resources to see that this right is fulfilled.\"\n\nBiden's Bizarre Gun Control Logic\n\nDespite the availability of an AR-15 to Stephen Willeford being a crucial factor that helped him bring and end to the Sutherland Springs, Texas church massacre, former Vice-President Joe Biden adamantly asserted that \"this is the type of gun no one should be allowed to have.\"\n\n\"I know some will argue that Willeford saved lives by shooting the guy who was killing dozens of people in that church,\" Biden acknowledged. \"But we've got to look at the bigger picture and be willing to make the sacrifices that promote the greater good. If Willeford hadn't had the AR-15 the killer might've shot a few more people. On the other hand, widespread ownership of AR-15s poses a much more serious threat that anti-government types could mount a dangerous resistance to government authority. Eliminating this greater danger by confiscating weapons like the AR-15 is clearly the better policy.\"\n\nThe editors at the Boston Globe newspaper took an even more extreme view than the former Veep and demanded that all 300 million privately held guns be confiscated. \"One of the commonly overlooked advantages of the former Soviet Union's gun control policies is that when only government authorities have legal access to firearms the ability of private citizens to shoot one another is drastically curtailed,\" the editors observed. \"Perhaps it's time for us to accept a sinilar trade-off and give up our freedom to own guns in exchange for the freedom to not be shot by our fellow citizens.\"\n\nIn possibly related news, a former Secret Service agent assigned to guard Biden during his vice-presidency claims that agents frequently had to intervene to protect women from being fondled by him. \"He'd get 'touchy-feely' at every opportunity,\" the agent recalled. \"We couldn't avert all the groping and would later cringe when we saw the evidence captured in photos of official events he attended. I mean, he doesn't have the same senility escape clause employed by former President Bush and his demented 'Copafeel' magician joke.\"\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: November 19, 2017 Edition""num_comments":0,"score":4,"selftext":"","subreddit":"ConservativeComedy","title":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: November 19, 2017 Edition"}

Leeann Tweeden - Claims that while backstage alone, Franken pressured her repeatedly to rehearse their kissing scene.  When she relented, he grabbed the back of her head and forced his tongue into her mouth until she pushed him away and told him to never do that again.  She then claims he harassed her for the rest of the tour in retaliation.  He also took a picture appearing to grope Tweeden (or mock-grope) on her breasts while she was sleeping without her knowledge.\n\n2. Lindsay Menz - Took a photo with Al Franken at the Minnesota State Fair while was a sitting senator and claims Franken wrapped his hand \"tightly around her butt cheek\" for three or four seconds. Menz's husband (who took the picture), father, and mother all corroborate that she told them immediately afterward what happened.  A Facebook post from 2010 between Menz and her sister also corroborates the story, as she tells her sister after posting the picture, \"Al Franken TOTALLY molested me! Creeper!\"\n\n3. Anonymous Woman #1 - Was singing with the feminist choir at the Women's Political Caucus in 2007 and after took a photo with Franken where she claims he grabbed her ass. Another member of the choir and the woman's best friend have both corroborated the story.\n\n4. Anonymous Woman #2 - Was attending a Democratic fundraiser in 2008 and took a photo with Franken where she claims he cupped her butt. She says she then excused herself to go to the bathroom and Franken leaned in and suggested he accompany her.  Zachary Roth, a Huffington Post reporter, corroborates this story himself and claims that the accuser told him years ago.\n\nNow, I didn't write all this to say that Al Franken should resign.  My own personal position is that no politician should resign over *legally* unproven sexual allegations.  They are simply too easy to fake.  (Does anyone seriously believe Hillary wouldn't stoop to paying someone to falsely accuse an opponent?  She paid people to cause violence at Trump rallies after all.)\n\nI write this because it has *really* gotten my goat how the liberal wings of Reddit have been crying about Trump and Moore and how guilty they are, but suddenly when it comes to Franken they're the biggest skeptics in the world.  They legitimately think the whole thing is a made-up right-wing conspiracy.\n\nIt clearly isn't.  Franken is a serial groper and the evidence is pretty damning.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"A quick and easy summary of all the accusations against Al Franken."}

If it loads are streams any slower than YouTube, it's only because CRTV has inferior servers.  If they would like to compete more, they could adjust their business plan to accommodate  more powerful servers, right? There's nothing stopping them from competing with an Uber liberal Mega site like YouTube, and that's the beauty of the internet. That is the internet in it's natural untouched state.\n\nNow, NBC owns Comcast. We as conservatives are concerned about liberal censorship online. We have seen Google filter out right wing websites, but many of you believe that NBC will not abuse its newfound power to choke out Brietbart, The Gateway Pundit, or Drudge. In fact, many here still are willing to fight for NBC's right to do this.\n\nNow, if the Republican Congress were to band together, get their heads out of their asses, and pass a law out of the blue one day that were to make it illegal for publicly funded colleges like UC Berkeley to silence opposing viewpoints, would you decry such a bill as the government controlling what you can and cannot say? I know many here would applaud such a bill. If not, would you then also claim that net neutrality is a government takeover of the free internet?\n\nTo me these are wildly inconsistent views. The internet is the most raw example of the free market that you could ever imagine. It is a place where one smart person's good idea can take out a giant company overnight, without any weird bullshit from the government stopping them. Protecting the internet's functionality in this capacity, I just do not see as some sort of government takeover of anything, any more than the first amendment is a government takeover of free speech.\n\n\nAgain, please consider that most isps, NBC-Comcast especially, are run by uber liberals who would absolutely use their unchallenged power to shut down any conservative speech on the internet. Let's say a bunch of conservative software engineers get together and make a user submitted right-leaning alternative to YouTube. Do you honestly think that NBC Comcast is going to put that site on their basic package right alongside YouTube, regardless of how big it got?\n\nThe free market only works if it actually exists. There is no free market with internet service providers, the majority of the country only has one provider to choose from. If Comcast decides that it's going to charge me extra to visit certain websites, I cannot vote with my wallet and switch to another ISP.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Isn't Net Neutrality a conservative position?"}

Not so much television now, unless it's YouTube clips. Because of that the idea of CRTV is really appealing. I'd love to have some type of news on in the background as I do other stuff, or just have it on to watch something that's not just mindless. \n\nThis past weekend I discovered Steven Crowder and his political commentary is good but even better is that he's a right leaning comedian. I'm someone who's huge into comedy, but it gets tiring hearing all the liberal comedians because it feels like a closed off bubble. It's a breath of fresh air to have Crowder as a conservative comedian. Plus he actually does give well educated responses to leftist points. I watched a ton of louder with Crowder on YouTube this weekend and got hooked. \n\nI also really like Mark Levin, I have read a couple of his books and respect his opinion when I hear it, so a daily show by him is also really appealing. \n\nI'm sure there's other stuff on there to check out but I just know of those two particularly.\n\nSo the question is is the 99 annual fee worth it? How long are the episodes, what time do they air, and are they pretty consistent? What are other shows to check out, and is the value really that much better than the free content you can already get out there? I'd appreciate any and all insight on CRTV. Thanks guys!","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Considering subscribing to CRTV, wanted to get some opinions on its value, and other shows to check out on it."}

{"author":"gronkspike25","created_utc":1512053861,"num_comments":0,"score":3,"selftext":"WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House has developed a plan to force out Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, whose relationship with President Trump has been strained, and replace him with Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, within the next several weeks, senior administration officials said on Thursday.\n\nMr. Pompeo would be replaced at the C.I.A. by Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas who has been a key ally of the president on national security matters, according to the White House plan. Mr. Cotton has signaled that he would accept the job if offered, said the officials, who insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive deliberations before decisions are announced.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Mr. Trump has given final approval to the plan, but he has been said to have soured on Mr. Tillerson and in general is ready to make a change at the State Department.\n\nJohn F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, developed the transition plan and has discussed it with other officials. Under his plan, the shake-up of the national security team would happen around the end of the year or shortly afterward.\n\nThe ouster of Mr. Tillerson would end a turbulent reign at the State Department for the former Exxon Mobile chief executive, who has been largely marginalized over the last year. Mr. Trump and Mr. Tillerson have been at odds over a host of major issues, including the Iran nuclear deal, the confrontation with North Korea and a clash between Arab allies. The secretary was reported to have privately called Mr. Trump a \u201cmoron\u201d and the president publicly criticized Mr. Tillerson for \u201cwasting his time\u201d with a diplomatic outreach to North Korea.\n\nMr. Tillerson\u2019s departure has been widely anticipated for months, but associates have said he was intent on finishing out the year to retain whatever dignity he could. Even so, an end-of-year exit would make his time in office the shortest of any secretary of state whose tenure was not ended by a change in presidents in nearly 120 years.\n\nWhile some administration officials initially expected him to be replaced by Nikki R. Haley, the ambassador to the United Nations, Mr. Pompeo has become the White House favorite.\n\nMr. Pompeo, a former three-term member of Congress, has impressed Mr. Trump during daily intelligence briefings and become a trusted policy adviser even on issues far beyond the C.I.A.\u2019s normal mandate, like health care. But he has been criticized by intelligence officers for being too political in his job.\n\nMr. Cotton has been perhaps Mr. Trump\u2019s most important supporter in the Senate on national security and immigration and a valued outside adviser. Officials cautioned that there was still a debate about whether Mr. Cotton was more valuable to the president in the Senate than taking in over the spy agency in Langley, Va., but he is the consensus choice at the moment.\n\nUnder Arkansas state law, Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, would appoint a replacement who could serve until the 2018 election. If Mr. Cotton stayed in the Senate, his seat would not be up for election again until 2020.\n\nAsked about a possible move, Caroline Rabbitt, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cotton, said, \u201cSenator Cotton\u2019s focus is on serving Arkansans in the Senate.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/us/politics/state-department-tillerson-pompeo-trump.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"White House Envisions Tillerson Ouster From State Dept., to Be Replaced by Pompeo, Within Weeks"}
