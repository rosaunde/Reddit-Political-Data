Many sensationalist claims have been thrown around, exemplified in articles like *All Hail (and Fear) Emperor Xi* by Bloomberg (goo.gl/P3kjBQ), and other characterizations of the move being a power grab. Despite the fact that Chinese real wages have grown, literally millions of people are lifted out of poverty on a yearly basis, and the fact that the position of Presidency is largely ceremonial, Xi Jinping\u2019s actions are seen as the action of an oppressive dictator seeking power. Now, due to the aforementioned reasons, the accusations are largely hollow. But, of course, the imperialist powers of the West need to cling on their anti-opposition narrative as tightly as possible, so, \u201cproof\u201d of his oppression must be conjured. And, of course, it has, with the recent accusations that China is banning words and even letters, below:\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5446053/China-bans-letter-N-hush-criticism-against-President-Xi.html\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/28/china-bans-the-letter-n-internet-xi-jinping-extends-power\n \nhttps://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17058074/china-banned-words-jinping\n\nEven media sources that have traditionally, in many cases, been anti-imperialist (like the Guardian) are eating this up. If anything, this only proves the \u201cFeeding frenzy\u201d imperialist style of the Western media that permeates its entire existence.

Keynes had already called this \u201ctechnological unemployment.\u201d As capital, it seeks out new investments and production offshoots. But, since the 70s, capital has been unable to expand on this basis of labor; in fact, it can\u2019t.\n\nThe article asks:\n\u201cIf robots, AI, nanotechnology, machine learning, and 3D printing are going to be doing all the work, what the heck will human beings do nine to five?\n\nHerein lies a problem in addressing this issue: assuming the motion of machines and robots were or are ipso facto \u201chuman.\u201d\n\nConsider briefly this comparison: a coal miner versus a coal mining machine. The coal miner\u2019s work you would call labor \u2014 because it is incorrectly assumed that labor is transhistorical and therefore necessary to human life. However, once the machine takes over these tasks, and replaces the coal miner, we don\u2019t call the robot a \u201claborer\u201d any more than we would describe its tasks as \u201chuman.\u201d\n\nCapital *is* a form of human activity but its position over labor renders the activity of (wage) labor superfluous except to its own self-expansion and needs.\n\nLabor\u2019s disappearance is because of it and its productivity\u2019s appropriation by the category of capital. Moreover, much of this labor has become unnecessary and has become hostile to life itself and yet (wage labor) remains for many our sole means of life.\n\nYou address this issue by reducing the time necessary to labor - ie the time necessary to reproduce a worker - and therefore the amount of time necessary to live; with more time available for activities AWAY from production and making profit; until finally labor is gone forever.\n\nCapitalists may very well call the coming tide of automation a 'crises.'  But we communists call this \u201cfree time\u201d (communism; the 'real movement') and its generality was first made possible BY capital (commodity, etc).  \n\n[on a side note: in this light, of increasing means in the form of fixed capital (machines, automation, etc) why have communists not figured out a way to 'bring the crises' to capital? i.e. cause a fall in the rate of profit?  I think it harkens back to the failed idea of 'class conflict' and revolution, the misrecognition of the proletariat as the potential to unravel this conflict and come into their own (as unexploited industrial labor --- an oxymoron if there ever was), when the proletariat does not have this potential ('labor can not become free play' Marx); the proletariat's potential is in the historically unique and specific position of (social) labor under capital, self-replacing labor, and the general conditions which can be exploited BOTH WAYS: the capitalists exploit (steal) the disposable time of the workers (which he calls profit), but the proletariat --- both 'free' to buy/sell their labor-power --- can rob the capitalists back --- again, consuming disposable time as their own (a protracted strike, for example, or blocking capital flows, as in high ways, major transports, shit, just taking a day off!).  The proletariat are in this unique position precisely because capital, on one side, constantly reduces the necessary labor-time to produce commodities, and on on the other, only does so as to posit its antithetical character (free time) as surplus labor.  What communists today foolish refer to as 'class consciousness' is not about becoming 'woke' to exploitation but understanding that the same premises which are exploiting us as proletariat can be used against the capitalist to exploit them back -- again, cause a fall in the rate of profit; absorption of the superfluous population into Variable Capital (wages); forcing the holders's of capital to invest it into more constant capital, machines and processes.  An organized working class, or proletariat, does this not to \"get the full value of labor,\" but to blow apart labor as a self-mediating activity and relation of production.  Instead of lazy ass communists waiting for the next crises to make their cases --- which are all bad --- we could cause a crises and at the same time would represent the 'other side' of exploitation, the one way we can rob back from these motherfuckers: absolute free time for all!)

This took me a while to make, as you\u2019ll soon be able to tell.\n\nThe majority of them have been drastically exaggerated and overstated in western media and the education system. Nevertheless, there were some genuine wrongdoings which i do not wish to defend.\n\nThere follows a more detailed explanation (sources are listed at the bottom):\n\n**Holodomor**\n\nThere are three questions to ask and answer when discussing the holodomor:\n\n1) Did it happen?\n\nYes. Very few people, if any at all, deny that a famine did occur in the years 1932-33 in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and parts of Russia and the Caucasus. The location of the famine is relevant for question two.\n\n2) Was it intentional?\n\nThe traditional line of reasoning goes that the famine was planned and implemented because the Soviet Government wanted to eliminate a potential Ukrainian independence movement. There are several flaws in this line of reasoning, which I will now explain:\n\nhttps://78.media.tumblr.com/88b8d71b82187c6e7b07424233c19254/tumblr_inline_p511mtlnQS1u8wcv4_1280.jpg\n\n**Location** - the famine was not limited to Ukraine. As stated before, it affected Kazakhstan and parts of Russia and the Caucasus. It even affected parts of Turkey and Bulgaria (this fact in itself calls into question how a famine supposedly made by the Soviet Government could have affected territories outside their control?). But it goes further than that, the region most affected by the famine was not Ukraine, but Kazakhstan. Further still, the most severely affected regions within Ukraine itself were parts with a significant Russian minority, and thus the least likely to support a Ukrainian independence movement. Ukrainian nationalism was strongest in the far west of the country, but it was the far east which was most affected. If the Soviet Government were trying to target Ukrainian nationalists, they certainly did a bad job of it.^^[1]\n\nhttps://78.media.tumblr.com/6371af5ae297077451fdf18f527aaf71/tumblr_inline_p511nkXzMR1u8wcv4_1280.gif\n\n**Government action in response to the famine** - World War 1 and the Russian Civil War had destroyed most industry in the country. Thus, the Soviet Government had been exporting grain in order to fund industrialisation programs. The reason they exported grain rather than their plentiful stocks of gold or metal was because the Soviet Union had been prevented from exporting these things via embargoes. In 1925, a gold blockade was implemented where western powers refused to trade gold for industrial supplies. More embargoes were put in place until, in the early 30\u2019s, western powers demanded that the Soviet Union pay for all equipment in grain. In 1930, the USSR exported 4,846,024 tons of grain. In 1931, the number increased to 5,182,835 tons. However, in 1932 there was a sharp drop in exports of grain, with only 1,819,114 tons being exported. They also began importing more grain. In 1932, 907,000 tons were imported ^^[1][2]. In addition to reducing grain exports and increasing imports, in 1933 the Soviet government set up political departments to help peasants in agricultural work, as well as providing grain aid to the afflicted areas. This relief worked, and the harvest in 1933 was much better than in previous years ^^[3].\n\nCorrespondence between the Ukrainian and Russian governments - letters sent between Stanislav Kosior (head of the Communist Party of Ukraine) and Joseph Stalin indicate a lack of clear and honest communication on Kosior\u2019s part - which was responsible for the initial lack of response to the famine - as well as Stalin\u2019s urgency to take action. The letters read as follows^^[1]:\n\nStalin:\n\n&gt;The Political Bureau believes that shortage of seed grain in Ukraine is many times worse than what was described in comrade Kosior\u2019s telegram; therefore, the Political Bureau recommends the Central Committee of the Communist party of Ukraine to take all measures within it\u2019s reach to prevent the threat of failing to sow [field crops] in Ukraine\n\nKosior:\n\n&gt;There are also isolated cases of starvation, and even whole villages [starving]; however, this is only the result of bungling on the local level, deviations [from the pary line], especially in regard of kolkhozes. All rumours about faming in Ukraine must be unconditionally rejected. The crucial help that was provided for Ukraine will give is the oppportunity to eradicate all such outbreaks [of starvation].\n\nStalin immediately responded:\n\n&gt;Comrade Kosior! You must read attached summaries. Judging by this information, it looks like the Soviet authority has ceased to exist in some areas of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Can this be true? Is the situation in villages in Ukraine this bad? Where are the operatives of the OGPU, what are the doing? Could you verify this information and inform the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist party about taken measures?\n\n3) Was it caused by government policy?\n\n**Environmental causes** - no doubt, environmental factors played a large role in the famine - there was drought in some areas, too much rain in others, attacks of rust and smut (fungal diseases), and infestations of insects and mice ^^[3].\n\n**History** - Collectivisation of agriculture was largely completed in the USSR by 1932.^^[3] Before collectivisation, the USSR &amp; Russian Empire had famines every 10\u201313 years ^^[4], and there had been severe famines in 1918, 1920, 1924 and 1928-29. After collectivisation had been implemented, there were only two major famines in the rest of the USSR\u2019s existence (i.e. 59 years). One of these was the 1932-33 famine, and the other occured just after World War 2 as a result of the destruction caused by the Nazi invasion. Judging by this inforamtion, collectivisation did likely not cause the famine, rather the aforementioned environmental causes did.\n\n**Gulags**\n\nPreviously estimated figures of the number of prisoners in the USSR were drastically over-estimated. During the 1980s, Robert Conquest alleged that in 1939 there were 25-30 million prisoners in the Soviet Union. More modern evidence shows that the number of prisoners in 1939 was actually 2.5 million (2.4% of the adult population), and only 454,000 of thosen were political prisoners. This is 3 million less than the number of prisoners in the United States in 1996, which was 5.5 million (2.8% of the adult population).^^[5]\n\nThe brutality and death rates in gulags has also been overstated. The death rate in gulags between 1930 and 1953 was 4%. This includes the World War 2 years. Excluding the World War 2 years, the death rate was 2.5%, which was lower than that of an average citizen in tsarist Russia in 1913. 1/3rd of inmates weren\u2019t required to work, however for those who did work the maximum work week was 84 hours.^^[6]\n\n**Repression**\n\nOnly 10% of arrests during Stalin\u2019s rule were for political reasons. Police, secret police and national guardsmes made up only 0.2% of the population, compared to police alone making up 1% of the population in the USA, meaning the kind of mass repression described in western media &amp; the education system would have been unfeasible.^^[6]\n\nOn the subject of democracy in the USSR, consider the following description by London Progressive Journal^^[7]:\n\n&gt;The USSR\u2019s written constitution places power firmly in the hands of the people, and indeed, representatives were regularly elected. The primary executive body of the USSR was the Supreme Council, which consisted of representatives from two committees: the Council of Nations and the Union Council. Representatives to each were elected for a 4 year term \u2013 for the Union Council, one representative for every constituency of 300,000, and for the Council of Nations: 25 representatives per Republic, 11 from each autonomous region, and one for each municipality for a specific nationality. The Supreme Council would then elect the government for the 4 year term (i.e. the Ministers) and the Chairman, also for a 4 year term. Committees were everywhere \u2013 school clubs, committees for social events, charity work, anything and everything. To be eligible to be elected Chairman, a candidate must have had experience governing at every level \u2013 local, municipal, and regional.\n\n**Executions**\n\nAgain, the number of executions carried out by the Soviet government has been over-estimated. Previous historians have placed the death toll in the millions or even tens of millions, however modern evidence from the Soviet archives shows that between 775,866 - 786,098 death sentences were passed between 1921-1953, and 12,733 people were executed before 1921 (during a time of civil war). This data implies a total count of around 800,000 however only 60% of these were carried out (based on a sample of 11,000 sentences during 1940, only 7,305 of which were carried out), bringing the number to 480,000. However, there is another aspect to consider. The vast majority of these death sentences were passed during the 1937-1938 period - during this period death sentences were passed by troikas who often passed sentences before the suspect had even been caught. Many of those sentenced by the troikas escaped capture, and a large number of death sentences were revoked by higher authorities. Soviet records indicate about 300,000 arrests by the troikas during the 1937-38 period, with a ratio of 1 execution for every 3 arrests, placing the number at 100,000. There were also 50,000 exections in labour camps at the time, and other sentences carried out by military and regular courts number 50,000, placing the total number of executions for the 1937-38 period at 200,000. Assuming the sentences passed during the other years of Stalin\u2019s rule had a 60% rate of being carried out, the total number executed while Stalin was in power is 250,000, and another 12,000 carried out before then comes to 262,000.^^[6]\n\n262,000 deaths is by no means a small number, but when placed in historical context and compared to other nations it is relatively small. For instance, the CIA-backed Suharto regime in Indonesia killed an estimated 2-3 million people in less than a single year, ^^[8][9] at a time when the population of the country was only 100 million, significantly less than the 162 million in the USSR in 1937.\n\nIt should also be noted that the leader of the NKVD (Soviet secret police) during 1937-38, Yezhov, was later arrested and executed by Stalin\u2019s government for his arbitrariness and excessiveness. A new head, Lavrenty Beria, was appointed and over 100,000 people were subsequently released.^^[10]\n\nSources\n\n[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUEi7v2TMpQ\n\n[2] http://web.mit.edu/17.601/www/grain_exports.htm\n\n[3] https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/03/03/the-holodomor-and-the-film-bitter-harvest-are-fascist-lies/\n\n[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droughts_and_famines_in_Russia_and_the_Soviet_Union\n\n[5] https://www.marxists.org/archive/bland/1999/x01/x01.htm\n\n[6] https://redscans.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/austin-murphy-the-triumph-of-evil.pdf\n\n[7] http://londonprogressivejournal.com/article/view/2185/the-ussr-the-democracy-you-didnt-know-about\n\n[8] https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/101east/2012/12/2012121874846805636.html\n\n[9] http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-36431837\n\n[10] https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/2xlk2j/more_evidence_that_stalin_did_not_plan_the_mass/\n\n---\n\nThank you for reading this far.

This article was by Marco Consolo, the Head of the Foreign Department, Party of the Communist Refoundation - European Left. The article, is also available in its [original Italian here](http://www.rifondazione.it/primapagina/?p=33051). I post this in hopes of generating furthering discussion on Erdogan, who I dislike with a passion. The article, in its translated form, is as follows:\n\nThe Turkish government, not content with arresting non-aligned journalists, suppressing internal opposition in the blood, assassinating and bombing the Kurdish people in Turkey and Syria, has carried out yet another maritime piracy in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe PRC-SE condemns the premeditated and unacceptable action of the government of Erdogan, whose Navy has threatened and blocked an ENI ship, which was heading towards the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Republic of Cyprus, to continue the his hydrocarbon research work, under license from Nicosia.\n\nErdogan's piracy actions are a dangerous provocation that has surpassed all precedents. These actions are manifestly illegal, unacceptable, and a serious threat to peace in the region.\n\nThis new provocation violates the principle of the territorial integrity of the States, the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus, as well as the conventional and customary law of the sea. Only a few days after meeting Mattarella, Gentiloni and the Pope, Erdogan's pirate behavior certainly can not go unnoticed.\n\nThe Italian government, the European Union and the UN must act decisively against Ankara to end its illegal actions that dangerously increase tension in the delicate region of the eastern Mediterranean. Instead of selling them weapons, the Italian government's duty is to take every possible diplomatic initiative to exert all the necessary pressure on Erdogan to put an end to his provocative actions. In particular, ensuring the continuation of the hydrocarbon research program of the Republic of Cyprus, initiated during the previous government of Demetris Christofias.\n\nThese actions not only affect the sovereign rights of Cyprus, but also negatively affect the broader energy planning in the Eastern Mediterranean. It is urgent to take concrete steps to ensure that Turkey is not allowed to play the role of modern pirate in the region, by attempting illegally and by force to redesign its energy map, trampling on the rights of sovereign states.\n\nThis new unacceptable \"incident\" underlines the need for a solution to the \"Cyprus question\", based on principles that safeguard the security and sovereignty of a free and reunified Federal Republic of Cyprus. The Secretary General of the United Nations is right in stating that the negotiations must continue from the point at which they were interrupted, preserving what has already been achieved. The goal is a global solution of the \"Cypriot question\", based on a single sovereignty and a single international juridical personality, with particular reference to the fact that the use of natural resources must be of federal competence.

We should clarify, specify and institutionalize the Party organizations\u2019 roles and responsibilities in decision making, implementation and oversight. We should adroitly handle the relationship between Party organizations and other management, clearly define the boundaries of rights and responsibilities, and form a management mechanism which is seamlessly cooperative, checked and balanced, and where each fulfills its own function and takes on its own responsibility. \n\nThe Party and the people place state assets under the control of business leaders, which is a great trust. We must conduct the education of SOE leaders on engagement with the Party, on principles, and on risks. We must be strict and impartial in political discipline and rules, and guide them to improve their political awareness, enhance their commitment to the Party, and keep vigilantly attentive. We should strengthen supervision of key targets, key positions and important personnel, especially leadership. We should improve the system for overseeing decision-making on major issues, important appointments and removals, major projects, and the use of large amounts of money. We should integrate daily management with supervisory scrutiny. \n\nFully relying on the working class is inherent to the Party\u2019s leadership of the SOEs. We should improve the democratic management system with the workers congress as the basic element, providing open access to the affairs and business of enterprises, ensuring the employees\u2019 right to stay informed about, participate in, and express views on and oversee their enterprise's affairs, while arousing the enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of the workforce. Enterprises should listen to the views of workers in major decision-making, and deliberate at workers congresses over major issues concerning the vital interests of the workers. We must adhere to and improve the system that employees serve as board directors and board supervisors, and encourage employees to participate in corporate governance.\n\nThe leadership of SOEs is the backbone of the Party in the economic sector and an important source of professional talent in national governance. They shoulder the responsibility of managing and preserving state assets and ensuring that they appreciate in value. These leaders must be loyal to the Party, and be bold and innovative in work. The must manage their enterprises well and produce results. They should enhance their political integrity, have a broad view, follow the core leadership of the CPC, and act in accordance with the Party\u2019s policies. They should also identify themselves with the Party, care for the Party, and defend the Party in every aspect of business operations and management. Faced with increasingly fierce domestic and international market competition, the leadership of the SOEs should rise to the challenges, be innovative, and lead the employees in breaking new ground. \n\nWe must adhere to the principle that the Party supervises the work of personnel management and has the right of appointment and removal of leadership and key staff, so that those who are politically qualified, competent and upright are selected. SOE leaders should work on the front-line with the workers, and those of excellent quality who have good experience are to be promoted to the leadership. We should strictly manage and care for the leadership, adopt incentive mechanisms, and leave them enough room to demonstrate their capability. We should publicize the successes and contribution of outstanding SOE leaders, and foster a social atmosphere that respects the value of entrepreneurs, encourages their creativity, and lets them play their role. \n\nThe strict governance of the Party should be applied to SOEs, branch organizations, ordinary Party members, and the basic enterprise system. We should ensure that new SOEs have Party organizations established the moment they are founded, and adjusted along with the development of the enterprise. We should carry out the routine education of Party members. Enterprise Party committees should organize regular branch meetings, branch committee meetings, group meeting, and Party lectures to emphasize commitment to the Party. Party branches should be the core that draws together the workers and staff, the school that educates Party members, and the fighting force for solving problems. We must take political philosophical education as a regular and basic task of Party organizations. Education in political philosophy should be combined with resolving concrete problems; it should be reasoned and practical, and we should do out best to win the hearts of the employees. \n\nParty committees at all levels should develop the role of the Party in SOEs in accordance with the principle of the Party supervising its own conduct with strict discipline. Local Party committees at all levels should put Party development in SOEs on their agenda, and Party committee (Party leadership group) in every enterprise should fulfill its own responsibilities as the main actor.

They should enhance their political integrity, have a broad view, follow the core leadership of the CPC, and act in accordance with the Party\u2019s policies. They should also identify themselves with the Party, care for the Party, and defend the Party in every aspect of business operations and management. Faced with increasingly fierce domestic and international market competition, the leadership of the SOEs should rise to the challenges, be innovative, and lead the employees in breaking new ground. \n\nWe must adhere to the principle that the Party supervises the work of personnel management and has the right of appointment and removal of leadership and key staff, so that those who are politically qualified, competent and upright are selected. SOE leaders should work on the front-line with the workers, and those of excellent quality who have good experience are to be promoted to the leadership. We should strictly manage and care for the leadership, adopt incentive mechanisms, and leave them enough room to demonstrate their capability. We should publicize the successes and contribution of outstanding SOE leaders, and foster a social atmosphere that respects the value of entrepreneurs, encourages their creativity, and lets them play their role. \n\nThe strict governance of the Party should be applied to SOEs, branch organizations, ordinary Party members, and the basic enterprise system. We should ensure that new SOEs have Party organizations established the moment they are founded, and adjusted along with the development of the enterprise. We should carry out the routine education of Party members. Enterprise Party committees should organize regular branch meetings, branch committee meetings, group meeting, and Party lectures to emphasize commitment to the Party. Party branches should be the core that draws together the workers and staff, the school that educates Party members, and the fighting force for solving problems. We must take political philosophical education as a regular and basic task of Party organizations. Education in political philosophy should be combined with resolving concrete problems; it should be reasoned and practical, and we should do out best to win the hearts of the employees. \n\nParty committees at all levels should develop the role of the Party in SOEs in accordance with the principle of the Party supervising its own conduct with strict discipline. Local Party committees at all levels should put Party development in SOEs on their agenda, and Party committee (Party leadership group) in every enterprise should fulfill its own responsibilities as the main actor. We must advocate integrity and fight against corruption in SOEs, focusing on Party discipline and rules, and persevere in implementing the Party Central Committee\u2019s Eight Rules [1] on improving Party and government conduct. We will rectify problems identified during discipline inspections without fail, and investigate and punish any people involved in embezzlement or abuse of state assets\u201d Xi Jinping, October 10th, 2016, \u201c*Main points of the speech at the National Conference on Party Development in SOEs\"\n\nNotes:\n\n1: The Eight Rules were proposed by the Political Bureau of the 18th Central Committee of the CPC to cut bureaucracy and maintain close ties with the people. They are summarized as follows: improving inspection and fact-finding trips, streamlining conferences and other activities, reducing documents and briefings, standardizing arrangements for visits abroad, enhancing security procedures, improving news reports, imposing restriction on publishing of writings without authorization, and practicing diligence and frugality.","subreddit":"communism","title":"A speech by Xi Jinping from \"The Governance of China Volume II\", delivered on 10/10/16, titled, \"Party Leadership Is the Unique Strength of State Owned Enterprises\"""num_comments":0,"score":4,"selftext":"","subreddit":"swcc","title":"A speech by Xi Jinping from \"The Governance of China Volume II\", delivered on 10/10/16, titled, \"Party Leadership Is the Unique Strength of State Owned Enterprises\""}

I previously thought of myself as an anarchist (without really bothering to educate myself on political theory) and this ideology seemed to sit comfortably with the aesthetic and themes of my favourite punk bands (Stooges, Ramones, Wire, Public Image Ltd., The Fall etc) and the genre in general. After embracing Marxism-Leninism I've recently become aware of how much punk rock (and rock/pop music more generally) tends to romanticise individualistic, hedonistic lifestylism and also nihilism. \n\nI'm trying to imagine a style punk rock that may actually embrace solidarity over individualism and revolutionary optimism over nihilism, but so far I'm drawing a blank. There are some bands that come to mind (The Clash, Fugazi, RATM) who incorporated anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist themes, but I think bands popular enough to reach a large audience are so steeped in the bourgeois-capitalist production mode that the message tends to undermine itself. Most young RATM fans knew very little about what the band supposedly represented - they just played it because it sounded macho, contained swearing and pissed off their parents. Overall, I doubt punk rock has provided much impetus for any revolutionary movement. Perhaps rock music in general is a liberal-bourgeois aesthetic form and cannot be redeemed. \n\nSo, do you think punk rock is an incompatible aesthetic for the communist movement? Is a revolutionary punk rock possible? Maybe the missing element has been not so much in the music itself but in failing to use live shows as an opportunity for organising. I'm interested to hear your thoughts. ","subreddit":"communism","title":"Thoughts on communism and punk rock."}

Snyder says: \u201cLenin said look, it\u2019s not so much the actual facts that matter what really matters is the deeper truth that in the future there\u2019s going to be a socialist utopia and if we have to bend the truth or even completely destroy the truth to get there that\u2019s worth it\u2026  because there\u2019s a better world out there and that\u2019s the deep truth.\u201d (Lenin as a precursor of post-truth, anyone?)\n\nThat is to say, according to Snyder (and Karl Popper) the alleged deceptiveness of leftists (Lenin and before him Marx) stems from their imposition of a preconceived notion of change, if not dreams, and with no regard for reality. The narrative is reminiscent of Karl Popper\u2019s condemnation of historicism and the association of Marx with Hegel, as if there were no difference between the two. The narrative is completely fallacious. It not only ignores Marx\u2019s polemics with the Utopian Socialists (a movement which he never belonged to) but also the fact that he broke with the Young Hegelians, who he had been closely associated with (particularly Bruno Bauer). Although the young Hegelians rejected Hegel\u2019s idealism and considered themselves materialists, nevertheless they failed to ground their thinking in the real structural basis of society \u2013 economy and class and not religious ideas which concerned Bauer and Feuerbach (in an attempt to undermine Prussian rule). Snyder would do well to read \u201cThe Holy Family\u201d in which Marx and Engels critique the young Hegelians who (inspired by the early Hegel) felt that utopia was yet to be achieved. For those who are interested in the topic, I would highly recommend the fascinating movie on the young Marx (in German with English subtitles) which can be watched on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtJnbJ_TfGk&amp;feature=youtu.be\n","subreddit":"communism","title":"MARXISM AND UTOPIANISM IS HARDLY ONE AND THE SAME, KARL POPPER NOT WITHSTANDING (from Steve Ellner\u2019s blog)"}

Original title was \"Iraqi Parliament Calls for U.S. Troop Withdrawal.\" Iraq's \nParliament is a unicameral body called the Council of Representatives. I thought that the \"chief executive\" referenced was the President, as the Prime Minister doesn't have such powers. This story was confirmed by others [here](http://muslimtimes.co/2018/03/01/iraqi-lawmakers-call-baghdad-set-timetable-withdrawal-foreign-troops), [here](https://www.newsmax.com/t/newsmax/article/846922?section=ronpaul&amp;keywords=iraq-war-media-troops&amp;year=2018&amp;month=03&amp;date=05&amp;id=846922&amp;aliaspath=%2FManage%2FArticles%2FTemplate-Main), [here](http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2018/03/01/554007/Iraq-US-foreign-troops-withdrawal-Daesh-parliament-Abadi), [here](http://www.iran-daily.com/News/210877.html), [here](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-03/02/c_137009322.htm), and [here](https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201803011062126328-iraq-parliament-demand-schedule-troops-withdrawal/) to name a few.\n\nOn March 2, the Iraqi quisling parliament passed a resolution requesting Iraq's Chief Executive to demand a timeline for withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops from Iraq.\n\nHowever, according to Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon, there will be no further U.S. drawdown of troops at this time. Pahon said, \u201cWe are shifting our focus from combat operations to training operations in order to ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS.\u201d\n\nThis marks the third declared mission change from a combat to a training role announced by the U.S. Armed Forces based at Combined Joint Operation Center Baghdad since their ground invasion of Iraq in March 2003. The first was on May 1, 2003 and the second was on December 14, 2011.\n\nAfter dropping an uncountable number of bombs and carrying out a scorched earth policy in Mosul last year, U.S. Armed Forces left behind a resounding message of ruthless intimidation by leaving the nearly annihilated city full of the mortal remains of thousands buried under the rubble. To this day, 8 months after the siege of Mosul was declared an occupation victory, U.S. Armed Forces are refusing to lift a finger to clean up the flesh and blood mess left in the wake of their mass slaughter of Iraqi people. Journalists and residents of the city are regularly reporting that the stench of rotten human corpses in Mosul is overpowering. Family members and friends are still searching for the remains of loved ones among the thousands of decayed bodies that litter the city.\n\nNATO troops will also continue to play a leading role in the spoliation.\n\nSeveral days after the parliamentary resolution, Iraq's Chief Executive \"requested\" long-term NATO presence in the country as well. NATO will continue operating out of Union III Forward Operating Base near the U.S. Armed Forces headquarters. Iraq will now start to feature more prominently as a NATO base of operations involving the 28 NATO allies in international anti-terrorism operations, according to NATO Secretary General Jen Stoltenberg in an interview with Agence France-Presse on March 5th. He explained, \"This is about helping Iraq, but also about helping ourselves.\"","subreddit":"communism","title":"Iraqi Legislature calls for U$ withdrawal, ignored by U$ imperialists"}

{"author":"Maurice-Golden","created_utc":1521523536,"num_comments":2,"score":9,"selftext":"A piece I wrote about Patrick the abolitionist and how International workers need to appropriate the holiday in order to promote solidarity between people of all ethnicities fighting for social justice and human rights. \n\n  \u201cOn the seventh day the lord rested, but before he did that, he squatted over the side of England, and what came out of him\u2026was Ireland\u201d\n(Bill The Butcher, Gangs of New York) \n\nAll the workers of the world should celebrate the birthday of Patrick regardless of race, religion, or nationality because he was, first and foremost, a freedom fighter.  \n\n\u201cSt. Patrick\u201d was a liberator. He was the Fredrick Douglass of Ireland. Patrick was a British man and citizen of the Roman Empire brought to Ireland and forced to work in bondage, eventually gaining his freedom, he thereafter set about bringing an end to slavery in Ireland, and this was eventually accomplished. Patrick had more in common with Frederick Douglass, Nat Turner, and Spartacus than he did with the clergy of Rome either then or now. The \u201csnake\u201d he cast out of Ireland was the practice of slavery by the inhabitants, unfortunately the means by which he did this (Christianity) set up another form of slavery. The tribalism surrounding St. Patrick\u2019s Day parades in America (where many people of all races claim some form of Irish heritage) and the symbols of Irish cultural identity and its fusion with the white nationalist movement is a detriment to all working class Americans regardless of race.\n\n The tumultuous history between Irish and Black ethnic groups in America came to a violent crescendo in the late nineteenth century \u201cFive Points\u201d district of New York City famed by the Martin Scorsese film \u201cGangs of New York\u201d, and based on the book of the same name. Although living in dire poverty and subject to anti-miscegenation laws and other forms of segregation meant to keep the working class (free or un-free) divided, you had \u201csaltwater\u201d African slaves (first or second generation slaves from Africa some of whom still held onto the language/culture of their ancestors) and Irish peasants (fleeing the effects of the potato famine and the cultural oppression of the Imperial British protestants upon Irish Roman Catholics) living together, playing music together, raising families together, and out of this sharing of cultures came some shared American art forms.\n\n Ironically Trump has resurrected the nativist bigotry at the time directed at Irish immigrants and now Mexican immigrants of the \u201cKnow-Nothing\u201d gang of WASP isolationist nativist American\u2019s a nomenclature that one could readily apply to the Republican Party, the Fascist right, libertarians, and other reactionary elements. However, class conflict and social injustice imposed by the timing of the Civil War and the drafting of poor Irish immigrants as soldiers for the Union Army led to some of the most horrific violence imposed on African Americans in the history of New York City, and still a century and a half later the tactics of divide and conquer are being used. Currently in the twenty-first century when the American people think of riots they automatically think inner city black populations in places like Baltimore, Detroit, or South Central LA, but the most atrocious riots in American history were perpetrated by ethnic Whites against people of color, hundreds if not thousands of times from the Fifteenth century to the mid-Twentieth century up to the present era, there are countless examples of terror instilled upon people of color, sadly this shows the power of propaganda in framing our consciousness.\n\n\u201cYe are the salt of the earth, and if ye are lacking, by what shall it be salted?\u201d \n\u2013Urban II \n\nThe fostering of working class solidarity between those who socially/culturally identify themselves as Irish-American and Black-American has been stymied since the beginning of the feudal agrarian system of slavery in the United States, when the Irish immigrants (in the seventeenth and eighteenth century many came as indentured servants, a station very near to slavery but with a solid difference many historians downplay; there service had an expiration date) were used as a buffer between the violence needed to subjugate and maintain the brutal holocaust of the slave-owning regime of Pre-Civil War America, and the Anglo-Saxon Protestants who formed it. The slave patrols, terminology such as \u201cpaddy\u201d wagons, as well as much of the culture of policing and the relation of the African American to the State came directly from this history (13th on Netflix). When you connect this with segregation and anti-miscegenation laws (not overturned until Loving v. Virginia in 1967) you have the perfect recipe for an apartheid regime (something as Americans we still have not come to terms with). Regardless of the era of migration in which the Irish came from the Mayflower to the present they have benefited from the laws enacted in order to set racial boundaries and enforce the \u201ccolor\u201d line. \n\nPatrick\u2019s image was used by African slaves through the practice of  \u201cnebulous dualism\u201d in order to retain their cultural identity in the face of a cultural genocide imposed by their slave masters. Patrick\u2019s image was often used to represent Damballah, a deity representing the male principle of the cosmic balance. He is the most revered of all the gods and goddesses carried to the New World from the ethnic/tribal cultures of West Africa from where the majority of African Slaves were shipped to the Americas. Although Patrick would have called these people \u201cheathens\u201d one would hope that he would understand the injustice and oppression of un-free labor that was forced upon them having himself been enslaved. \n\nKarl Marx writing in the nineteenth century identified Ireland as the \u201ctoilet of the British Empire\u201d (one might today call it the Alabama of the American Empire.) The mother country has also been known for nationalism, racism, and xenophobia in the past and present. A country with rampant Anti Semitism that stayed neutral during WW2, so much so that Ireland\u2019s most famed writer James Joyce made a point of making the main character in his Magnum Opus \u201cUlysses\u201d about a day in Dublin, Ireland a Jew.  In counterpoint, you also have the somewhat maligned Bono/U2, who performed at the Grammy\u2019s this year with Kendrick Lamar, and whose band\u2019s hit song from the eighties was a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. In the 1970\u2019s parts of Belfast resembled parts of South Central Los Angeles in the 1990\u2019s. The Irish are not new to injustice at the hands of Empire and thus have much in common with the African diaspora. In Irish history you have what amounts to genocide imposed by the British Army under Oliver Cromwell in the Sixteenth Century, and a famine in the Nineteenth century tied to economic reasons that led to the Irish immigrants coming to America en masse and setting up the conflict between the \u201cPatriot\u201d and \u201cIrish\u201d gangs in the aforementioned \u201cGangs of New York\u201d. It is time for the African and Irish diaspora in America to see their shared history of struggle and oppression as a point of unity and not contention. \n\nFor far too long the working classes have been divided and controlled by elitists for their own means. Just take a   look at the daily headlines about Trump; his campaign and the rotten and corrupt administration (and it\u2019s propaganda parrot Fox News) that grew out of it has gorged itself on bigotry and the vault of racist and divisive conspiracy theories of the white nationalist Fascist right.  As we saw in Charlottesville and our \u201cDotard-in-Chief\u2019s\u201d response to it, we are living in a time where this strategy of \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d is more alive than ever. We should all celebrate and be comfortable celebrating together the shared American values of liberty and justice, and have solidarity with each other in the ongoing struggle for justice for Black America regardless of race/ethnicity because we are all Americans now. Frederick Douglass once said \u201cWhere justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe.\u201d Patrick would have agreed. Freedom and justice for all, without racism or nationalism, is something we should all fight for and celebrate on St. Patrick\u2019s Day. As the Rolling Stones said \u201cRaise your glass for the Salt of the Earth!\u201d \n\n-Morris Gold \n3/17/18\n","subreddit":"communism","title":"Patrick and the struggle to end Slavery in Ireland: A rumination on St. Patrick's Day ;the Irish and African American relationship, and an argument for International workers solidarity."}

Pahon said, \u201cWe are shifting our focus from combat operations to training operations in order to ensure the lasting defeat of ISIS.\u201d\n\nThis marks the third declared mission change from a combat to a training role announced by the U.S. Armed Forces based at Combined Joint Operation Center Baghdad since their ground invasion of Iraq in March 2003. The first was on May 1, 2003 and the second was on December 14, 2011.\n\nAfter dropping an uncountable number of bombs and carrying out a scorched earth policy in Mosul last year, U.S. Armed Forces left behind a resounding message of ruthless intimidation by leaving the nearly annihilated city full of the mortal remains of thousands buried under the rubble. To this day, 8 months after the siege of Mosul was declared an occupation victory, U.S. Armed Forces are refusing to lift a finger to clean up the flesh and blood mess left in the wake of their mass slaughter of Iraqi people. Journalists and residents of the city are regularly reporting that the stench of rotten human corpses in Mosul is overpowering. Family members and friends are still searching for the remains of loved ones among the thousands of decayed bodies that litter the city.\n\nNATO troops will also continue to play a leading role in the spoliation.\n\nSeveral days after the parliamentary resolution, Iraq's Chief Executive \"requested\" long-term NATO presence in the country as well. NATO will continue operating out of Union III Forward Operating Base near the U.S. Armed Forces headquarters. Iraq will now start to feature more prominently as a NATO base of operations involving the 28 NATO allies in international anti-terrorism operations, according to NATO Secretary General Jen Stoltenberg in an interview with Agence France-Presse on March 5th.

He was the Fredrick Douglass of Ireland. Patrick was a British man and citizen of the Roman Empire brought to Ireland and forced to work in bondage, eventually gaining his freedom, he thereafter set about bringing an end to slavery in Ireland, and this was eventually accomplished. Patrick had more in common with Frederick Douglass, Nat Turner, and Spartacus than he did with the clergy of Rome either then or now. The \u201csnake\u201d he cast out of Ireland was the practice of slavery by the inhabitants, unfortunately the means by which he did this (Christianity) set up another form of slavery. The tribalism surrounding St. Patrick\u2019s Day parades in America (where many people of all races claim some form of Irish heritage) and the symbols of Irish cultural identity and its fusion with the white nationalist movement is a detriment to all working class Americans regardless of race.\n\n The tumultuous history between Irish and Black ethnic groups in America came to a violent crescendo in the late nineteenth century \u201cFive Points\u201d district of New York City famed by the Martin Scorsese film \u201cGangs of New York\u201d, and based on the book of the same name. Although living in dire poverty and subject to anti-miscegenation laws and other forms of segregation meant to keep the working class (free or un-free) divided, you had \u201csaltwater\u201d African slaves (first or second generation slaves from Africa some of whom still held onto the language/culture of their ancestors) and Irish peasants (fleeing the effects of the potato famine and the cultural oppression of the Imperial British protestants upon Irish Roman Catholics) living together, playing music together, raising families together, and out of this sharing of cultures came some shared American art forms.\n\n Ironically Trump has resurrected the nativist bigotry at the time directed at Irish immigrants and now Mexican immigrants of the \u201cKnow-Nothing\u201d gang of WASP isolationist nativist American\u2019s a nomenclature that one could readily apply to the Republican Party, the Fascist right, libertarians, and other reactionary elements. However, class conflict and social injustice imposed by the timing of the Civil War and the drafting of poor Irish immigrants as soldiers for the Union Army led to some of the most horrific violence imposed on African Americans in the history of New York City, and still a century and a half later the tactics of divide and conquer are being used. Currently in the twenty-first century when the American people think of riots they automatically think inner city black populations in places like Baltimore, Detroit, or South Central LA, but the most atrocious riots in American history were perpetrated by ethnic Whites against people of color, hundreds if not thousands of times from the Fifteenth century to the mid-Twentieth century up to the present era, there are countless examples of terror instilled upon people of color, sadly this shows the power of propaganda in framing our consciousness.\n\n\u201cYe are the salt of the earth, and if ye are lacking, by what shall it be salted?\u201d \n\u2013Urban II \n\nThe fostering of working class solidarity between those who socially/culturally identify themselves as Irish-American and Black-American has been stymied since the beginning of the feudal agrarian system of slavery in the United States, when the Irish immigrants (in the seventeenth and eighteenth century many came as indentured servants, a station very near to slavery but with a solid difference many historians downplay; there service had an expiration date) were used as a buffer between the violence needed to subjugate and maintain the brutal holocaust of the slave-owning regime of Pre-Civil War America, and the Anglo-Saxon Protestants who formed it. The slave patrols, terminology such as \u201cpaddy\u201d wagons, as well as much of the culture of policing and the relation of the African American to the State came directly from this history (13th on Netflix). When you connect this with segregation and anti-miscegenation laws (not overturned until Loving v. Virginia in 1967) you have the perfect recipe for an apartheid regime (something as Americans we still have not come to terms with). Regardless of the era of migration in which the Irish came from the Mayflower to the present they have benefited from the laws enacted in order to set racial boundaries and enforce the \u201ccolor\u201d line. \n\nPatrick\u2019s image was used by African slaves through the practice of  \u201cnebulous dualism\u201d in order to retain their cultural identity in the face of a cultural genocide imposed by their slave masters. Patrick\u2019s image was often used to represent Damballah, a deity representing the male principle of the cosmic balance. He is the most revered of all the gods and goddesses carried to the New World from the ethnic/tribal cultures of West Africa from where the majority of African Slaves were shipped to the Americas. Although Patrick would have called these people \u201cheathens\u201d one would hope that he would understand the injustice and oppression of un-free labor that was forced upon them having himself been enslaved. \n\nKarl Marx writing in the nineteenth century identified Ireland as the \u201ctoilet of the British Empire\u201d (one might today call it the Alabama of the American Empire.) The mother country has also been known for nationalism, racism, and xenophobia in the past and present. A country with rampant Anti Semitism that stayed neutral during WW2, so much so that Ireland\u2019s most famed writer James Joyce made a point of making the main character in his Magnum Opus \u201cUlysses\u201d about a day in Dublin, Ireland a Jew.  In counterpoint, you also have the somewhat maligned Bono/U2, who performed at the Grammy\u2019s this year with Kendrick Lamar, and whose band\u2019s hit song from the eighties was a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. In the 1970\u2019s parts of Belfast resembled parts of South Central Los Angeles in the 1990\u2019s. The Irish are not new to injustice at the hands of Empire and thus have much in common with the African diaspora. In Irish history you have what amounts to genocide imposed by the British Army under Oliver Cromwell in the Sixteenth Century, and a famine in the Nineteenth century tied to economic reasons that led to the Irish immigrants coming to America en masse and setting up the conflict between the \u201cPatriot\u201d and \u201cIrish\u201d gangs in the aforementioned \u201cGangs of New York\u201d. It is time for the African and Irish diaspora in America to see their shared history of struggle and oppression as a point of unity and not contention. \n\nFor far too long the working classes have been divided and controlled by elitists for their own means. Just take a   look at the daily headlines about Trump; his campaign and the rotten and corrupt administration (and it\u2019s propaganda parrot Fox News) that grew out of it has gorged itself on bigotry and the vault of racist and divisive conspiracy theories of the white nationalist Fascist right.  As we saw in Charlottesville and our \u201cDotard-in-Chief\u2019s\u201d response to it, we are living in a time where this strategy of \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d is more alive than ever. We should all celebrate and be comfortable celebrating together the shared American values of liberty and justice, and have solidarity with each other in the ongoing struggle for justice for Black America regardless of race/ethnicity because we are all Americans now. Frederick Douglass once said \u201cWhere justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe.\u201d Patrick would have agreed. Freedom and justice for all, without racism or nationalism, is something we should all fight for and celebrate on St. Patrick\u2019s Day. As the Rolling Stones said \u201cRaise your glass for the Salt of the Earth!\u201d \n\n-Morris Gold \n3/17/18\n","subreddit":"communism","title":"Patrick and the struggle to end Slavery in Ireland: A rumination on St. Patrick's Day ;the Irish and African American relationship, and an argument for International workers solidarity.""num_comments":0,"score":6,"selftext":"","subreddit":"blackpower","title":"Patrick and the struggle to end Slavery in Ireland: A rumination on St. Patrick's Day ;the Irish and African American relationship, and an argument for International workers solidarity."}

These include implementing new development concepts, carrying out further all-round reform, implementing the going-global strategy and the Belt and Road Initiative, increasing the national strength, promoting economic and social development, and ensuring and improving the wellbeing of the people. We should implement policies that preserve and increase the value of state assets, improve the competitiveness of the state-owned sector of the economy, and expand state-owned capital. We must also promote reform of SOEs, improve their management, strengthen supervision over state assets, and make consistent efforts to help SOEs become bigger, stronger, and better. \n\nSOEs serve as a material and political foundation for socialism with Chinese characteristics. They are a pillar supporting the Party in the governance and rejuvenation of China. Since the PRC was founded in 1949, and especially since reform and opening up began in 1978, SOEs have made remarkable achievements in their development. They have made a historic contribution to China\u2019s economic and social development, scientific and technological progress, national defense and public wellbeing. \n\nFollowing the Party\u2019s leadership and strengthening the Party organization are a great tradition of the SOEs, their root and soul, and a unique strength.\n\nThe general requirements for SOEs in the current era are as follows:\n\n* upholding the principle of the Party in supervising its own conduct with strict discipline; resolving problems concerning the weakening and marginalization of the Party and its leadership; never wavering in upholding the Party\u2019s leadership of SOEs; Party organizations playing the role of leadership and and political core; guaranteeing the implementation of policies and major plans of the Party and the country;\n\n* insisting upon Party organizations\u2019 leadership and examination over the appointment of SOE leaders; focusing on the cultivation of high-caliber SOE leaders; and \n\n* building strong grassroots Party branches; making sure the Party develops in tandem with the enterprise and Party branches act as a strong organizational guarantee in making SOEs bigger, stronger and better. \n\nWe must uphold the important political principle of the Party\u2019s leadership over SOEs. A modern corporate system is the goal of reform. SOEs\u2019 modern corporate system with Chinese features is unique because it incorporates the Party\u2019s leadership into all aspects of their corporate governance structure. It also clarifies and ensures the real status of Party organizations and personnel being in place, clear responsibilities, and strict supervision. \n\nThe Party\u2019s leadership of SOEs consists of political, ideological and organizational guidance, and the Party organizations in SOEs work as political core leadership, steering the correct direction, controlling the overall situation, and guaranteeing the implementation of decisions. We should clarify, specify and institutionalize the Party organizations\u2019 roles and responsibilities in decision making, implementation and oversight. We should adroitly handle the relationship between Party organizations and other management, clearly define the boundaries of rights and responsibilities, and form a management mechanism which is seamlessly cooperative, checked and balanced, and where each fulfills its own function and takes on its own responsibility. \n\nThe Party and the people place state assets under the control of business leaders, which is a great trust. We must conduct the education of SOE leaders on engagement with the Party, on principles, and on risks. We must be strict and impartial in political discipline and rules, and guide them to improve their political awareness, enhance their commitment to the Party, and keep vigilantly attentive. We should strengthen supervision of key targets, key positions and important personnel, especially leadership. We should improve the system for overseeing decision-making on major issues, important appointments and removals, major projects, and the use of large amounts of money. We should integrate daily management with supervisory scrutiny. \n\nFully relying on the working class is inherent to the Party\u2019s leadership of the SOEs. We should improve the democratic management system with the workers congress as the basic element, providing open access to the affairs and business of enterprises, ensuring the employees\u2019 right to stay informed about, participate in, and express views on and oversee their enterprise's affairs, while arousing the enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of the workforce. Enterprises should listen to the views of workers in major decision-making, and deliberate at workers congresses over major issues concerning the vital interests of the workers. We must adhere to and improve the system that employees serve as board directors and board supervisors, and encourage employees to participate in corporate governance.\n\nThe leadership of SOEs is the backbone of the Party in the economic sector and an important source of professional talent in national governance. They shoulder the responsibility of managing and preserving state assets and ensuring that they appreciate in value. These leaders must be loyal to the Party, and be bold and innovative in work. The must manage their enterprises well and produce results. They should enhance their political integrity, have a broad view, follow the core leadership of the CPC, and act in accordance with the Party\u2019s policies. They should also identify themselves with the Party, care for the Party, and defend the Party in every aspect of business operations and management. Faced with increasingly fierce domestic and international market competition, the leadership of the SOEs should rise to the challenges, be innovative, and lead the employees in breaking new ground. \n\nWe must adhere to the principle that the Party supervises the work of personnel management and has the right of appointment and removal of leadership and key staff, so that those who are politically qualified, competent and upright are selected. SOE leaders should work on the front-line with the workers, and those of excellent quality who have good experience are to be promoted to the leadership. We should strictly manage and care for the leadership, adopt incentive mechanisms, and leave them enough room to demonstrate their capability. We should publicize the successes and contribution of outstanding SOE leaders, and foster a social atmosphere that respects the value of entrepreneurs, encourages their creativity, and lets them play their role. \n\nThe strict governance of the Party should be applied to SOEs, branch organizations, ordinary Party members, and the basic enterprise system. We should ensure that new SOEs have Party organizations established the moment they are founded, and adjusted along with the development of the enterprise. We should carry out the routine education of Party members. Enterprise Party committees should organize regular branch meetings, branch committee meetings, group meeting, and Party lectures to emphasize commitment to the Party. Party branches should be the core that draws together the workers and staff, the school that educates Party members, and the fighting force for solving problems. We must take political philosophical education as a regular and basic task of Party organizations. Education in political philosophy should be combined with resolving concrete problems; it should be reasoned and practical, and we should do out best to win the hearts of the employees. \n\nParty committees at all levels should develop the role of the Party in SOEs in accordance with the principle of the Party supervising its own conduct with strict discipline. Local Party committees at all levels should put Party development in SOEs on their agenda, and Party committee (Party leadership group) in every enterprise should fulfill its own responsibilities as the main actor. We must advocate integrity and fight against corruption in SOEs, focusing on Party discipline and rules, and persevere in implementing the Party Central Committee\u2019s Eight Rules [1] on improving Party and government conduct. We will rectify problems identified during discipline inspections without fail, and investigate and punish any people involved in embezzlement or abuse of state assets\u201d Xi Jinping, October 10th, 2016, \u201c*Main points of the speech at the National Conference on Party Development in SOEs\"\n\nNotes:\n\n1: The Eight Rules were proposed by the Political Bureau of the 18th Central Committee of the CPC to cut bureaucracy and maintain close ties with the people. They are summarized as follows: improving inspection and fact-finding trips, streamlining conferences and other activities, reducing documents and briefings, standardizing arrangements for visits abroad, enhancing security procedures, improving news reports, imposing restriction on publishing of writings without authorization, and practicing diligence and frugality.","subreddit":"communism","title":"A speech by Xi Jinping from \"The Governance of China Volume II\", delivered on 10/10/16, titled, \"Party Leadership Is the Unique Strength of State Owned Enterprises\"""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"rwcc","title":"A speech by Xi Jinping from \"The Governance of China Volume II\", delivered on 10/10/16, titled, \"Party Leadership Is the Unique Strength of State Owned Enterprises\""}

Yet it never happens, and never even comes close to materialising. But why? \n\nWithout wasting any time on examining the complete joke that is the electoral Communist parties, the Naxals have spent decades trying to emulate Mao's people's war (aided by uninterrupted Chinese aid and even a literal invasion of India in 1962), entirely without success. The reason why is actually quite simple, once you look at a map of the [red corridor](https://indiaandissues.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/iapmap.jpg) and overlay it with a map of [areas inhabited by *adivasis* - the indigenous people of the Indian Subcontinent](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3486/1774/1600/b-districts-kbk.gif). Despite it's intellectual tradition beginning with high caste bengali Charu Majumdar, the movement was pretty much entirely co-opted by the resentments of Eastern India's tribal forest belt, limiting potential sympathy from other sections of Indian society. \n\nThe reason why Mao's People's War and even a Leninist form of revolution would never work in India is rather simple. China is over 90% ethnic Han. While the Russian Empire/USSR didn't have as homogeneous a population, it did have a single ethnic group as a large plurality, which also inherited a power structure over all other ethnic groups. India faces this issue twofold: There is no single dominant ethnic group who's collective will or social cohesion can push a revolution through, and there is no single ethnic group which holds the undisputed reins of power over all others. \n\nIn fact, it could be argued that this is the main reason why the Indian bourgeois state has been so stable. There is no single ruling class, but instead a variety of distinct bourgeoisies that compete and collaborate as see fit. Hell, decades of India's rigorous affirmative action has even created a bourgeoisie within the lowest castes, right down to the untouchables (commonly referred to in India as the \"creamy layer\"). Traditionally, India's caste system has had 5 tiers: the clerical Brahmins, the warrior Kshatriyas, the mercantile Vaishya caste, and the peasant/labouring Shudra caste, and finally the \"untouchable\" Dalits. Indigenous peoples existed outside this system altogether, and land has traditionally been owned by castes somewhere between #2 and #3. Due to their position in society, Brahmins have traditionally formed the intellectual backbone of most progressive currents in modern Indian history, but have also been a part of upholding old, regressive power structures. In Bengal, Brahmins form a sizeable vote for electoral Communist parties, but in North India they often vote for the hindu nationalist BJP. The most politically reactionary elements of Indian society however, tend to be found in the mercantile caste, while the warrior caste is the most socially conservative.\n\nRight now, India is governed by the conservative nationalist BJP party with a leader, Narendra Modi, who is considerably more neoliberal than his own party cadre and the average Indian, and was elected upon a mandate to accelerate development after a mass feeling of economic stagnation after several decades of nearly uninterrupted pseudo-socdem corrupt rule from the Congress party. However, the electoral landslide of the BJP can be put in even better perspective if you divide the political map of India into the [Hindi speaking belt](https://southasiablog.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/hindi-belt-election-results.jpg?w=808&amp;h=915) (\"core\" India, if you will) and the [rest of the country.](https://southasiablog.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/non-hindi-belt-election-results.jpg?w=834&amp;h=944) As [this](https://southasiablog.wordpress.com/2014/05/28/indian-election-results-map/) article points out, due to the lack of a traditional ethnic identity, the North Indian heartlands have typically identified along with their caste and voted along caste lines. The BJP managed to smash through this by appealing to their common identity as Hindus. Replacing caste consciousness with a shared Hindu consciousness (Hindus make up just under 80% of India's population) at the expense of other religious minorities if need be, is central to the BJP's ideology. \n\nAn India where people identify through their caste will never be able to achieve a successful revolution. The \"untouchable\" caste of Dalits are probably the caste which would have been the easiest and most ripe for radicalization. However, the two largest obstacles to this are; a) the emergence of a bourgeois political class amongst themselves and b) their demographic insignificance compared to other caste groups, which would unite to undermine them for their own interests. In this regard, the BJP's reactionary hinduization tendencies may actually serve a useful purpose in the long run. The caste system is a much more organic and deeply entrenched form of social organization than religious polarization, when looking at Indian history in the long run. If the BJP successfully bring 80% of the country onto the same page, at least in the core northern regions, then a revolution will spread much faster than it ever could in current circumstances. If, however (as I suspect) their vision for \"hinduization\" ultimately fails, it will still heighten the ever increasing contradictions within Indian society and make dissatisfaction with the current status quo boil over, leading to India's multiple bourgeoisies destroying each other. Modi's fairly successful \"industrialisation\" efforts through liberal reform by rapidly attracting foreign capital will simultaneously improve upon the infrastructure needed for a future socialist society, while also widening the wealth gap to a point where the contradictions will become all too unsustainable. \n\nTo examine how a successful socialist revolution in India would unravel, one must look to history for examples. Easily the most epochal moment of Indian history (at least since the time of the First Battle of Panipat in 1526, where the Mughal Empire was born) is it's struggle for Independence from Britain. \n\nThe first armed uprising to materialise against the British began in North India in 1857, as a mutiny from Indian colonial soldiers, and it was ultimately a failure. However, momentum against the British began to pick up pace when the intellectual nucleus of anti-colonialism (along with other liberal concepts such as a common Indian nationality and rejection of old Hindu norms) in India emerged from the high caste intelligentsia of Bengal in the East. It wasn't until a materialistic consciousness of imperialism arose amongst the mercantile caste in the economic heartlands in Western India (Bombay, Gujarat - where Gandhi was from) in forms such as the Swadeshi movement and Salt March,  that the fight against imperial rule really took wings. While all this was going on, South India was seeing it's own radical *Self-Respect* movement against casteism, inequality and superstition. However, anti-imperialist sentiment was a lot more muted in the South than the other regions, and this movement also revolved around Dravidian nationalism and separatism against the \"Aryan\" North. \n\nClass collaboration is an integral part of corporatist Fascist ideology. The contemporary right-wing current in Indian politics seeks *caste* collaboration, which is functionally identical. However, it was caste collaboration which ultimately ended British rule in India, and only caste collaboration can bring successful revolution to India. When it came to Independence, the brahmin caste, warrior caste and mercantile caste were instrumental in combining efforts across region and ethnicity to push for independence. The labour and lowest castes were politically powerless, while the land-owning caste were with the British til the very end. However, in the event of a socialist revolution, things would be quite different. The Brahmin, Shudra and Dalit castes would form the ideological and proletarian backbones of said revolution, while the landed and mercantile caste would rigorously fight against it, alongside some reactionary brahmin ideologues. I am unsure as to how the warrior caste would be involved. \n\n**TL;DR - No socialist revolution can succeed in India without gaining traction in the right regions, amongst multiple castes, at the right time.**\n\nWhat do you think? Especially those of you familiar with India's situation. I personally think that India's revolutionary potential can only be assessed and harnessed through a Left Communist framework where revolution is spontaneous and widespread, since proactive vanguardism would be ineffective in a country as diverse and stratified as India.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Revolution in India: is it impossible?""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"capitalistindia","title":"Revolution in India: is it impossible?"}

The Maharaja himself was implicated in some instances. A large number of Muslims were killed. Huge number of Muslims have fled to West Pakistan, some of whom made their way to the western districts of Poonch and Mirpur, which were undergoing rebellion.

Dixon arrived in the subcontinent in May 1950 and, after a visit to Kashmir, proposed a summit between India and Pakistan. The summit lasted five days, at the end of which Dixon declared a statewide plebiscite was impossible. Dixon summarized that people in Jammu and Ladakh were clearly in favour of India; equally clearly, those in Azad Kashmir and the Northern Areas wanted to be part of Pakistan. This left the Kashmir Valley and 'perhaps some adjacent country' around Muzaffarabad in uncertain political terrain.  The sticking point was that Dixon proposed, following Liaquat Ali Khan's objections, that Sheikh Abdullah administration should be held in \"commission\" (in abeyance) while the plebiscite was held.

He was simple, calm and courageous. He seldom lost his poise; pondered his problems slowly, made his decisions clearly and firmly; never yielded to ostentation nor coyly refrained from holding his rightful place with dignity. He was the son of a serf but stood calmly before the great without hesitation or nerves. But also\u2014and this was the highest proof of his greatness\u2014he knew the common man, felt his problems, followed his fate.\n\n&gt; Stalin was not a man of conventional learning; he was much more than that: he was a man who thought deeply, read understandingly and listened to wisdom, no matter whence it came. He was attacked and slandered as few men of power have been; yet he seldom lost his courtesy and balance; nor did he let attack drive him from his convictions nor induce him to surrender positions which he knew were correct. As one of the despised minorities of man, he first set Russia on the road to conquer race prejudice and make one nation out of its 140 groups without destroying their individuality.\n\n&gt; His judgment of men was profound. He early saw through the flamboyance and exhibitionism of Trotsky, who fooled the world, and especially America. The whole ill-bred and insulting attitude of Liberals in the U.S. today began with our naive acceptance of Trotsky\u2019s magnificent lying propaganda, which he carried around the world. Against it, Stalin stood like a rock and moved neither right nor left, as he continued to advance toward a real socialism instead of the sham Trotsky offered.\n\n&gt; Three great decisions faced Stalin in power and he met them magnificently: first, the problem of the peasants, then the West European attack, and last the Second World War. The poor Russian peasant was the lowest victim of tsarism, capitalism and the Orthodox Church. He surrendered the Little White Father easily; he turned less readily but perceptibly from his ikons; but his kulaks clung tenaciously to capitalism and were near wrecking the revolution when Stalin risked a second revolution and drove out the rural bloodsuckers.\n\n&gt; Then came intervention, the continuing threat of attack by all nations, halted by the Depression, only to be re-opened by Hitlerism. It was Stalin who steered the Soviet Union between Scylla and Charybdis: Western Europe and the U.S. were willing to betray her to fascism, and then had to beg her aid in the Second World War. A lesser man than Stalin would have demanded vengeance for Munich, but he had the wisdom to ask only justice for his fatherland. This Roosevelt granted but Churchill held back. The British Empire proposed first to save itself in Africa and southern Europe, while Hitler smashed the Soviets.\n\n&gt; The Second Front dawdled, but Stalin pressed unfalteringly ahead. He risked the utter ruin of socialism in order to smash the dictatorship of Hitler and Mussolini. After Stalingrad the Western World did not know whether to weep or applaud. The cost of victory to the Soviet Union was frightful. To this day the outside world has no dream of the hurt, the loss and the sacrifices. For his calm, stern leadership here, if nowhere else, arises the deep worship of Stalin by the people of all the Russias.\n\n&gt; Then came the problem of Peace. Hard as this was to Europe and America, it was far harder to Stalin and the Soviets. The conventional rulers of the world hated and feared them and would have been only too willing to see the utter failure of this attempt at socialism. At the same time the fear of Japan and Asia was also real. Diplomacy therefore took hold and Stalin was picked as the victim. He was called in conference with British imperialism represented by its trained and well-fed aristocracy; and with the vast wealth and potential power of America represented by its most liberal leader in half a century.\n\n&gt; Here Stalin showed his real greatness. He neither cringed nor strutted. He never presumed, he never surrendered. He gained the friendship of Roosevelt and the respect of Churchill. He asked neither adulation nor vengeance. He was reasonable and conciliatory. But on what he deemed essential, he was inflexible. He was willing to resurrect the League of Nations, which had insulted the Soviets. He was willing to fight Japan, even though Japan was then no menace to the Soviet Union, and might be death to the British Empire and to American trade. But on two points Stalin was adamant: Clemenceau\u2019s \u201cCordon Sanitaire\u201d must be returned to the Soviets, whence it had been stolen as a threat. The Balkans were not to be left helpless before Western exploitation for the benefit of land monopoly. The workers and peasants there must have their say.\n\n&gt; Such was the man who lies dead, still the butt of noisy jackals and of the ill-bred men of some parts of the distempered West. In life he suffered under continuous and studied insult; he was forced to make bitter decisions on his own lone responsibility. His reward comes as the common man stands in solemn acclaim. \n\n[Source.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/biographies/1953/03/16.htm)","subreddit":"communism","title":"W. E. B.

This is utterly ironical.\n&gt; \n&gt; The U.S., situated in the American continent across the ocean, dares not deny the fact even though it is reluctant more than others to acknowledge the DPRK's success in the ICBM launch. A big question is how come the ICBM of the DPRK is taken as medium-range ballistic rocket by Russia, a country very close to the DPRK.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another question is that Russia, which will be grouchy if it is ranked second in military standings, is making desperate efforts to make its far-fetched assertions sound plausible while misusing even the name of the Defence Ministry.\n&gt; \n&gt; The world people are watching the erratic act of Russia with surprise as its authorities and the public have differing stand over the launch. Lots of military experts, media and social circles of Russia are unanimously acknowledging the launch as ICBM launch but this is denied only by the authorities.\n&gt; \n&gt; What is skeptical is that whether Russia's virtual concept on object is not ruled by its perversity and jealousy that big country's rifle should be regarded as a rocket and small country's rocket should be taken as a rifle.\n&gt; \n&gt; **For years, Russia took outwardly strong stand toward the U.S., as it used to say that \"sanctions resolutions\" against the DPRK should not affect the normal economic and trade activities of the DPRK and its people's living at a time when the issue was on agenda at UN even though Russia was subject to trouble as a key target of sanctions and pressure by the U.S. Therefore, the world has been skeptical about its assertion of calling the ICBM a medium-range ballistic rocket. However, Russia, which had showed bravery as if it was going to hinder the adoption of the \"resolution sanctions\" on the DPRK, boarded the ship operated by the U.S. all of a sudden to be \"complimented\" by Trump. This is quite enough for the world to guess what was the true aim sought by Russia in insisting that the ICBM of the DPRK was a medium-range ballistic rocket.**\n&gt; \n&gt; The far-fetched assertion of Russia has become an engine that heartened the DPRK to work for more launches of ICBM and compelled it to take new measures of action.\n&gt; \n&gt; It will be clear to Russia itself whether it is really the blind or is feigning the blind.\n&gt; \n&gt; **If Russia does not drop its own \"big power concept\" which it values so much, the reality in which it is not treated as a big power even though it is a big power will be its permanent destiny.**\n\nSecond, here's the full article where a General responds to Trump's comments since the press love taking statements from the DPRK out of context to inverse reality and make them appear as the aggressors:\n\n&gt; Pyongyang, August 10 (KCNA) -- General Kim Rak Gyom, commander of the Strategic Force of the Korean People's Army, released the following statement on August 9:\n&gt; \n&gt; [As already clarified](http://www.naenara.com.kp/en/news/?0+102154), the Strategic Force of the KPA is seriously examining the plan for an enveloping strike at Guam through simultaneous fire of four Hwasong-12 intermediate-range strategic ballistic rockets in order to interdict the enemy forces on major military bases on Guam and to signal a crucial warning to the U.S.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tuesday, the KPA Strategic Force through a statement of its spokesman **fully warned the U.S. against** its all-round sanctions on the DPRK and **moves of maximizing military threats to it**.

{"author":"intlnews","created_utc":1521836596,"author":"Ozcom","created_utc":1491023998.0,"num_comments":0,"score":14,"selftext":"Nick G.\n\nA Japanese-Indian joint venture car manufacturer has utilised the full force of state violence to try to intimidate and coerce its Indian workforce. \n\nOn March 18, 13 strike activists and trade union leaders from the Maruti-Suzuki car plant at Manesar were sentenced to life imprisonment, 4 were given five years imprisonment and a further 14 were released, but with no compensation for the three years they had been kept in gaol. A futher 113 workers, most of whom had spent 3 years in gaol without bail, were acquitted.\n\nThe workforce has also been subjected to wholesale sackings, attempts to crush its union, and police violence.\n\nBackground to Maruti and Suzuki\n\nIn 1970, a private limited company named Surya Ram Maruti Technical Services Private Limited (MTSPL) was launched with the stated purpose of providing technical know-how for the design, manufacture and assembly of \"a wholly indigenous motor car\".  This reflected the desire of the Indian national bourgeoisie for overcoming reliance on foreign car manufacturers. However, the company was unsuccessful and went into liquidation.\n\nRevived in February 1981, Maruti was 74% owned by the Indian government, and 26% by Suzuki of Japan.  In 1983 it went into production with a version of the Suzuki Alto. Initially, production was low and the company served mainly to import fully-manufactured Suzukis from Japan. The success of the joint venture led Suzuki to increase its equity from 26% to 40% in 1987, and to 50% in 1992, and further to 56.21% as of 2013.  Thus, the aspirations of Indian national bourgeois elements were crushed by Japanese finance capital and a neo-liberal comprador Indian national government.\n\nWorkers organise to resist attacks, fight for rights at work\n\nWorkers at Maruti have been systematically denied their rights as defined by the Conventions of the International Labour Organisation.  Despite being denied the right to organise and to bargain collectively, workers have persisted in struggle and learned how to organise despite obstacles.  In 2000, workers at Maruti went on an indefinite strike, demanding among other things, major revisions to their wages, incentives and pensions. The management refused union demands citing increased competition and lower margins. The central government privatized Maruti in 2002 enabling  Suzuki to became the majority owner of Maruti Udyog Limited.\n\nMaruti-Suzuki opened the  Manesar plant in 2006, employing trainees for up to three years and contract workers who performed the same tasks as permanent workers in core areas of manufacturing activity, but paid a lower wage. From the beginning of the Manesar operation, workers experienced extremely high work intensity, with unpaid forced overtime work, wage deductions even for planned leave and overbearing and abusive supervision and invasive surveillance.  \n\nOn August 29, 2011, management demanded that all workers at Manesar sign a \u201cgood conduct bond\u201d. The bond required the workers to declare that they would \u201cnot resort to go slow, intermittent stoppage of work, stay-in-strike, work-to-rule, sabotage or otherwise indulge in any activity, which would hamper the normal production in the factory\u201d. The majority of workers refused to sign the bond although management made it clear that those who refused would be sacked. \n\nIt was clear from statements from the very highest levels of the Suzuki Corporation that the harsh tactics had the support of the Japanese. MSI\u2019s parent Suzuki Motor Corp (SMC) stood behind the company with Chairman Osamu Suzuki ruling out any compromise on discipline.\n\nSuzuki had told representatives of Maruti Udyog Kamgar Union (MUKU), the elected union of Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) that the management of the Indian arm would not accept any indiscipline in the company.\n\nWith the savagery of a war-time prisoner-of-war camp supervisor, Suzuki ranted that \u201cIndiscipline is not tolerated... not in Japan, not in India. It is never in the interest of any company and its people.\u201d \n\nThis was how the imperialists and their local stooges responded to their own company-created union which workers had been coerced into joining.\n\nFor the remainder of the year, workers fought for and won, on 1 March 2012, registration of their own union, the Maruti Suzuki Workers Union (MSWU) through which they submitted a Charter of Demands on 18 April 2012, Maruti Suzuki management violated core principles of bargaining in good faith, and refused to negotiate on a core issue related to terms and conditions of work \u2013 the use and treatment of contract workers. This created an industrial dispute.\n\nIn the course of the dispute a supervisor abused a worker with a caste slur. This was one of a series of provocations by management aimed at breaking off negotiations.  When the worker was sacked, his comrades went on strike demanding his reinstatement. 200 \"bouncers\" (gangs of thugs) and police forces crushed the strike with brute force. When one of the company\u2019s personnel managers died in a fire started at the plant during intense struggle between the workers and the thugs and police, 148 strike leaders were held responsible, slandered as \"terrorists\" and spent five years in prison with the trial continually delayed until March of this year.  \n\nThose arrested were denied bail by the Haryana High Court which confirmed that people\u2019s democratic rights and liberties were secondary to the interests of imperialist finance capital: \u201cThe incident is a most unfortunate occurrence which has lowered the reputation of India in the estimation of the world. Foreign investors are not likely to invest money in India out of fear of labour unrest\u201d.\n\nAlmost all 2,500 workers were dismissed illegally resulting in an almost complete replacement of the staff.\n\nSolidarity against the verdict\n\nMaruti workers at the Manesar plant have continued to lend their support to the imprisoned workers \u2013 financially, emotionally and morally. Every year, Maruti Workers observe March 1 in commemoration of the formation of the union and in these meetings, support is expressed for the imprisoned workers. This year, it gained significance as it was clear that the verdict was about to be pronounced. A massive meeting was held near the plant, and thousands of workers from other factories including Hero MotoCorp, Honda and other ancillary plants had joined them. More than 20 unions representing over 25,000 workers came together demanding the immediate release of the workers.\n\nEven though such extreme instances of police violence were supposed to rein in labour unrest in the region, issues have only pushed more and more workers to protest and form unions to defend their rights. Struggles by workers in Honda Motors Scooters India, Hero MotoCorp, Bellsonica, Rico and Daikin only go to show the increasing class polarisation in the Gurgaon-Manesar region of Haryana as well as the Neemrana region of Rajasthan.\n\nThis criminalisation of Indian trade unionists is an attack against the workers of Maruti-Suzuki and their families, against the Indian workers and trade union movement and against automotive workers worldwide.\n\nIt is part of a pattern in which automotive manufacturing in developed capitalist countries is destroyed while its most exploitative features are transferred to low wage countries.\n\nThe history of the Maruti-Suzuki company verifies Lenin\u2019s observation that \u201cthe specific political features of imperialism are reaction all along the line and increased national oppression\u2026\u201d (Imperialism, The Highest Stage of Capitalism).\n\nSolidarity with the convicted automotive workers of Maruti-Suzuki!\n\nFree the convicted Suzuki-Maruti workers \u2013 Financial compensation for the workers illegally imprisoned for up to 31 months!\n\nWorkers of the world \u2013 unite!\n\nPostscript. The following solidarity message has been sent to the Maruti workers and the International Automotive Workers Coordination:\n\nThe Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist) unreservedly supports the heroic Maruti-Suzuki workers of Manesar in their struggle to defend their rights and liberties.  The fascist repression directed at the workers and their leaders, including the creation of company unions, the replacement of permanent workers with temporary workers, police violence, media misrepresentation and heavy prison terms, place a heavy burden on those fighting for workers\u2019 rights.  However, when workers stand united and refuse to be intimidated, their eventual success is guaranteed.\n\nSolidarity with the Maruti-Suzuki workers of Manesar!\n\nNick G.\nChairperson,\nCommunist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist)\nApril 1, 2017\n\nhttp://www.cpaml.org/posting1.php?id=442 ","subreddit":"communism","title":"Solidarity with the heroic Maruti-Suzuki workers of Manesar, India!""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"capitalistindia","title":"ICYMI: 7 months ago, a post on /r/communism about \"Solidarity with the heroic Maruti-Suzuki workers of Manesar, India!\""}

The military claims that this is not a coup but a \"bloodless transition.\" The basis of the current crisis is claimed to be a power struggle within the Zanu-PF party over Mr. Mugabe's firing of his vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, and his intent to replace him with his wife.\n\nThat said, this is the BBC, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nThere is a decided lack of information, but things don't look very good. Robert Mugabe has made significant efforts to keep Zimbabwe free of domination by Western imperialism and Western capitalism. After nearly two decades of appeasing the IMF and the World Bank, Mugabe seemed to rediscover something of his Marxist roots and expelled them from the country in the late 1990s. He further aroused the anger of the West by initiating land reform in 2000, expropriating land from 4,000 white settlers and distributing it to 300,000 landless indigenous families. He has been an obstacle to the exploitation of the country by Western capital (Zimbabwe has something like 20% of the world's known diamond reserves). If this is the end of Robert Mugabe's time in power, I can only hope that whoever comes after him will be as stubbornly independent of the West as he has been these last twenty years, though I fear that they will not.\n\nFurther information would be appreciated.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Strange things going on in Zimbabwe""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"capitalistzim","title":"Strange things going on in Zimbabwe"}

The new Zimbabwe, to be established now, need to be founded on the values and principles of constitutionalism, the rule of law, a just and prosperous society. In the new Zimbabwe, every citizen must be free to pursue life, liberty, and happiness...[Zimbabwe needs] Political and institutional reforms, which include aligning the country\u2019s laws with the 2013 constitution, and in particular actualizing the provisions dealing with devolution and the land question. [Zimbabwe also needs] Major economic reforms that focus on restoring livelihoods, growing a shared economy and addressing the huge challenge of unemployment and under-development...the new authorities must show some signs of a commitment to real transformation other than cosmetic statements on the economy. The real danger is that they will pursue a Beijing model, in the respect of which there are nominal improvements on the economy while political space is closed and democracy is muzzled. It is therefore important that the new authorities show signs of commitment to real change...We ask the international community and the U.S. to keep us in your hearts. Do not allow our country to be forgotten in our battle against tyranny and poverty and for democracy and human rights. Our election requires active support and oversight from the international community, including our American friends.

He has already mentioned a partial return of land to some white commercial farmers, he has embraced the rhetoric of anti-corruption, offering a three-month amnesty window to return ill-gotten gains. But these promises don\u2019t stand up to scrutiny...this opposition fragmentation is enormously beneficial to ZanuPF, allowing them a real possibility of winning at the polls even if opposition parties attract more votes between themselves.

Assad is compradore bourgeois, Russia's actions are imperialist, no side should be supported\n\n2. though Russia is imperialist we have an obligation to oppose imperialism in our own country \n\n3. Russia's actions in Syria are not imperialist, the government of Syria is the legitimate government the YPG and FSA are proxies of NATO and thus should be opposed.\n\nThough I disagree with number 2, the topic of this post is the the #1 line which I have seen espoused by some people proclaiming to be MLM. \n\nThe reason I am focusing on #1 as opposed to number two, is that although number two is still wrong, it is actually consistent, and forming a front with them against NATO intervention is still possible and realistic. \n\nWhereas the first line is right wing opportunist and revises the basic principle of anti imperialism, here is a part from a piece by lenin called [The Defeat of One\u2019s Own Government in the Imperialist War:](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/jul/26.htm)\n\n&gt;During a reactionary war a revolutionary class cannot but desire the defeat of its government.\n\n&gt;This is axiomatic, and disputed only by conscious partisans or helpless satellites of the social-chauvinists. Among the former, for instance, is Semkovsky of the Organising Committee (No. 2 of its Izvestia), and among the latter, Trotsky and Bukvoyed,[2] and Kautsky in Germany. To desire Russia\u2019s defeat, Trotsky writes, is \u201can uncalled-for and absolutely unjustifiable concession to the political methodology of social-patriotism, which would replace the revolutionary struggle against the war and the conditions causing it, with an orientation\u2014highly arbitrary in the present conditions\u2014towards the lesser evil\u201d (Nashe Slovo No. 105).\n\n&gt;This is an instance of high-flown phraseology with which Trotsky always justifies opportunism. A \u201crevolutionary struggle against the war\u201d is merely an empty and meaning less exclamation, something at which the heroes of the Second International excel, unless it means revolutionary action against one\u2019s own government even in wartime. One has only to do some thinking in order to understand this. Wartime revolutionary action against one\u2019s own government indubitably means, not only desiring its defeat, but really facilitating such a defeat. (\"Discerning reader\u201d: note that this does not mean \u201cblowing up bridges\u201d, organising unsuccessful strikes in the war industries, and \u00b7in general helping the government defeat the revolutionaries.)\n\n&gt;The phrase-bandying Trotsky has completely lost his bearings on a simple issue. It seems to him that to desire   Russia\u2019s defeat means desiring the victory of Germany. (Bukvoyed and Semkovsky give more direct expression to the \u201cthought\u201d, or rather want of thought, which they share with Trotsky.) But Trotsky regards this as the \u201cmethodology of social-patriotism\"! To help people that are unable to think for themselves, the Berne resolution (Sotsial Demokrat No. 40)[1] made it clear, that in all imperialist countries the proletariat must now desire the defeat of its own government. Bukvoyed and Trotsky preferred to avoid this truth, while Semkovsky (an opportunist who is more useful to the working class than all the others, thanks to his naively frank reiteration of bourgeois wisdom) blurted out the following: \u201cThis is nonsense, because either Germany or Russia can win\u201d (Izvestia No. 2).\n\nHow ironic that those who claim to uphold Marxism Leninism Maoism, the highest stage of Marxism and a continuity and rupture with Marxism Leninism, cannot uphold this one simple principle: The defeat of ones own imperialism! \n\nThese opportunists in their refusal to take a stand against their own imperialism, as Lenin advocated so many years ago, are betraying the movement, and are objectively helping their own imperialism by refusing to stand against it. \n\n \n\n\n\n","subreddit":"communism","title":"A denunciation of some so called \"maoists\" here regarding syria:""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"syrsocialdem","title":"A denunciation of some so called \"maoists\" here regarding syria:"}

What about the self-determination of the Albanian people that constitute a larger majority in Kosovo than in Albania itself? I realise that the situation in Kosovo is currently horrendous under NATO-occupation and rule as a non-state with war criminal leaders. But given a choice between NATO and Serbia, a country which forcibly deported thousands of Albanians, I think most would choose NATO rule and try to work from that (the left party of Kosovo became the single largest party in the election of june 2017).\nAnd when there was communism in Albania, surely Albania was the more socialist state, while Yugoslavia upheld its standard of living for the South Slavs by way of Western loans to the country.\n\nI agree with much of the message and in my daily life I always try to non-abrasively inform friends and family about how Eastern Europe actually fares much worse under capitalism than communism. Most people here in the West seem to think that Eastern Europe was \"liberated\", yet ignore the unsustainable conditions of capitalist Eastern Europe. \n\nBut, why do leftist people seem to support Yugoslavia and later Serbia in the case of Kosovo?

That's simply an economic fact. However, the question of 'is it revisionist' is a bit more murky. First, I'm not sure the category has the same value it did when the USSR was around. If we define revisionism as capitulating to the bourgeoisie for economic gain, then the least revisionist state, Albania which refused all foreign debt and advocated complete self-sufficiency and economic planning, and the most revisionist Yugoslavia which survived only on debt to capitalist countries and its value to the U.S. in the cold war, are exactly the same place: gone from this Earth. Of course there are real differences and I would gladly defend the value of Albania's socialism for the future while immediately dismissing Yugoslavia's market socialism as worthless. But can we say North Korea is revisionist for buying capital goods from imperialist nations on debt (and then defaulting like a boss)? Can we say Cuba is revisionist for opening SEZs so that it can get dollars which determine access to basic resources like oil and food? Neither country is capable of complete self-sufficiency, at least at a level above moderate poverty, so it's a matter of how much engagement, on what terms, and with whom, and these seem to me to be practical questions which are very different without the USSR's generous trade policy. \n\nIf we define revisionism as supporting imperialism for national gain vs opposing it (again Albania vs Yugoslavia is a clear contrast) then both Cuba and North Korea are remarkably consistent. But of course such concepts are nebulous. Is North Korea revisionist for engaging with South Korea? Both the people of South Korea and the people of North Korea democratically decided to pursue normalization of relations (for the first time in history). North Korea has remained steadfast in its opposition to imperialism and the US military occupation, even during the height of the Sunshine policy, but they have paid the price and the North Korean people are the ones who live with the real economic consequences of the Kaesong SEZ shutting down. Can we really judge their anti-imperialism based on an abstract ideal?\n\nIf we define socialism as a path rather than as a mode of production then the definition becomes even more unclear. The path to what? Communism? If communism is a global project, this 'path' doesn't actually tell us anything about the here-and-now. Western 'leftists' are fine with that but the North Korean people live in the here-and-now and don't have the luxury of waiting for global communism in the imperialist center. Further, what exactly is this path? Is China more socialist because it's further on the path (having gone very far during the GPCR and then somewhat backtracking) while Venezuela is behind on the path (actively advocating for socialism but never having consolidated a planned economy)? These things sounds cool but fall apart when confronted with real empirical analysis. \n\nIf socialism is a mode of production which then determines a superstructure, then what exactly are the criticisms against North Korea? It doesn't have workers democracy? How do we measure that? By any Marxist definition, this would be the amount of exploitation combined with the power of the 'coercive laws of competition' as measured by worker organizations, institutionalized political power, and legal rights. I've never seen anyone who dislikes NK do this, and until such an analysis is done any talk of revisionism and worker's power is pure ideology. It doesn't have political freedoms? Clearly it does, as the constitution makes clear. If this is a facade, again we run into the fantasy of the Potemkin village. Why pretend? For who's benefit? Why go to such lengths? Why is the burden of proof on NK to prove it is not lying (a negative)? Again, simple reason (Occam's Razor most notably) is cast aside when imperialist propaganda is brought to bear with its full weight.\n\nFinally, what do these questions mean for socialists outside of NK? What does it mean to 'support' a nation or a struggle? Do we have any real influence on NK or is our already marginal influence inevitably captured and appropriated by bourgeois propaganda? If our task is to oppose our own imperialists, is there a functional difference between active and passive support? Of course communists have to separate truth from falsehood, but how much can we, particularly as atomized individuals, really speak on truth from falsehood on the issue? If our task is obedience to a party (or more generally fidelity to the truth of communism) then we really only have a polemical task. Such a task made communists who had to 'switch sides' on WWII or the post-Stalin USSR recoil but with our modern understanding of revisionism and imperialism as well as the collapse of the western communist parties into Eurocommunism and the collapse of the non-communist left into CIA stooges this revulsion seems less the result of principle and more the result of ego based on imperialist spoils. Opposing imperialism when all propaganda points to it as 'supporting dictators' as was the case in Syria, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc only to find that within a couple of years the entire 'truth' of the invasion collapses kind of implies that we have to stick to general principles like 'imperialism is bad' even when specific truths elude us.\n\nSo yeah to answer your question I support the DPRK as a socialist state which is revisionist as the real world demands. I support it in my limited capacity and would be glad to criticize it for its shortcomings on the basis of socialist, anti-imperialist solidarity. But I think the discussion is so poor that actually debating these questions has not happened and 99% of what's spoken about NK is pure trash.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Casual Discussion of the DPRK and Revisionism""num_comments":0,"score":2,"selftext":"","subreddit":"juchekorea","title":"From 1 year ago: Casual Discussion of the DPRK and Revisionism"}

{"author":"intlnews","created_utc":1522007263,"author":"anschelsc","created_utc":1462654989.0,"num_comments":9,"score":24,"selftext":"So, I've been living in La Paz for about ten months, and two things have become quite clear to me.\n\n1. The Morales administration has had an overwhelmingly positive effect on the well-being of the Bolivian people, and has done so in a much more sustainable way than many other left-wing South American governments in this period.\n\n2. The changes that have been taking place here over the last ten years are not leading to socialism.\n\nLet me expand both points a bit. First off, all the meaningful indicators have improved drastically: poverty, health, median income, etc. The economy has been booming (at least 5% growth every year) throughout the period despite what's happened in the rest of the world, and even the drastic fall in energy prices over the last couple years hasn't caused either economic troubles or government debt. There are also meaningful day-to-day changes in things like the quality of transportation, availability of doctors and lawyers in the countryside, and so on. And speaking anecdotally, it's pretty clear that the people themselves are legitimately enthusiastic about the direction things are headed.\n\nHowever, the Bolivian economy is still highly undeveloped, in the Marxist sense of being a very early stage of capitalism with low levels of both mechanization and centralization. According to what I've read, something like two thirds of the Bolivian workforce is informally or self-employed. That includes the peasants (who have owned their own land since the reforms of the 50s) but also a sizable chunk of the urban workforce. Indeed, many of the jobs that as a (North) American I expect to be done by wage or salaried labor (like driving buses, shining shoes, or selling vegetables) are instead carried out by small business owners and their family members. I think it's reasonable to describe this class as petite-bourgeois, and it's much larger here than in wealthier countries.\n\nAnd the government programs that have made such a huge difference in improving Bolivians' lives are not generally working to change this; in many cases they are even encouraging the development of the petite-bourgeoisie, for example by providing no-interest loans and free disaster insurance to small businesses and farms. Now, it's hard for me to argue against such programs, because in the short term they really are making lives better and keeping a large segment of the population out of poverty. But the ostensible goal of the ruling party is to create socialism, and it's hard to see that happening when the current trend is if anything *against* collectivization of labor.\n\nSo my question is, are the government's policies in fact leading to socialism in a way that I'm not seeing? If not, what *should* be done? Is the improvement in quality of life here worth the possible long-term costs?\n\nFinally, just to head this off at the pass: this is a speculative conversation. I'm not suggesting that an online forum is either competent or capable of actually setting Bolivian economic policy, and I do believe in democracy. If your comment is that the Bolivian people should decide these things for themselves, trust that everyone here agrees with you, and don't expect a reply.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Survival vs development in Bolivia""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"pinktide","title":"Survival vs development in Bolivia"}

The arguments and so many elements that we have from a legal, economic, geographical, historical point of view in particular, are irrefutable. That is why we are with the truth, with justice, no longer as the message of the Chilean State, with reason and force, this is the force of reason, it is the force of truth, it is the force for justice. We are already in the 21st century and there again I want to say that the arguments of the Bolivian people, expressed by our brother agent, as well as by our international lawyers, are impeccable. In Bolivia you feel that feeling that echoes in your hearts to return to the Pacific Ocean with sovereignty.\n\n*Is Bolivia strengthened?*\n\n&gt; With his arguments, Chile, this Friday, for example, sought to intimidate the world by saying that we wanted to change the 1904 Treaty. I am very sincere, initially I had proposed that this treaty be revised with the argument or with the jurisprudence of the 1903 Treaty between Panama and the United States, on the Panama Canal. After so many efforts, meetings and debates, in that case, that treaty was eliminated and the US returned the channel to the Panamanians, which, eyewitness, had delivered in perpetuity. But, our case is completely different, that's why the lawyers, our jurists, at the head of H\u00e9ctor Arce, explained me very well and I understood perfectly. I want to tell you, again, to see that there is a horizontal debate with the vice president (and other collaborators). Not because the Evo says should be applied, our demand is not wrong, it is for Chile to fulfill its commitments, its offerings after taking us out with an invasion our exit to the Pacific Ocean. They accuse us of trying to change the 1904 Treaty, when after that treaty Chile offers and agrees with Bolivia to give sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. It is clear, anyone shows that, unfortunately Chile is anchored in its contradictions. They do not know how to justify, and the worst thing is that they never mention the invasion of 1879. Of course, they will not, because if it was not that invasion, there would not be this problem. There would be no pending issue about sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. I want to say, after listening, first to our agent and lawyers and then the two dawns from Bolivia, to the Chilean defense, that I am much more convinced. That defense they did on Thursday and Friday helps us because they recognize the legal part, the historical part, but they blame us, that for us the conclusions were not reached, that there were no diplomatic relations, that is not the issue of background, it's only because they did not comply.\n\n*Chile repeats until the exhaustion that the Treaty of 1904 will demand, on Friday Foreign Minister Ampuero said it almost ten times in the declaration he made, when at different moments in history his country offered sovereign exit outside the treaty, is not it ?*\n\n&gt; If it is about enforcing treaties, then explain to me why they did not comply with the treaty of 1866, which was the one of limits. In 1920 they commit themselves to give a sovereign exit to the Pacific, so that Bolivia has its own port, that happened after 1904, and it was done independently of that treaty. Another is the 1950 agreement, where they ask for compensation and not territorial, but water. Therefore, the demand is not about that treaty, but about the fulfillment of those offers, promises, agreements and resolutions of the OAS. Legal arguments abound, and in international law there is much jurisprudence around the world about how the ICJ solves these issues in a peaceful way. Chile wants to misrepresent our claim because it has no arguments. In addition, its representatives seek to intimidate, to intimidate the world, to say that Bolivia wants to change the Treaty of 1904, when it has already been revised, and at their request. In the competition decision, the court stressed that it did not solve pending issues. Apart from our demand, that treaty marked peace and friendship. And, in the facts, neither one nor the other was fulfilled.\n\n*Foreign Minister Ampuero and Agent Grossman repeat that Chile will not cede sovereignty, but as you say, his lawyers cite cases of 1950 when Chile negotiated sea for water, and in 1975 that Pinochet negotiated territorial exchange, this will not be a message to open that the issue is solved by barter, how do you see it?*\n\n&gt; I want to tell you that I do not want to comment anything before the ruling. I ask with much respect. Also, I do not want to estimate or calculate what the resolutions of the ruling will be. A part of the Chileans say that it is necessary to give sea with sovereignty. Other voices say sea by land, it's like a territorial exchange. They are opinions, and we respect, I do not want to get ahead, but what I do perceive in a general way is that they feel defeated. The court can not fail by telling us to give territory with sovereignty, but any negotiation with Chile must have goals and objectives. What good would any failure be if there were no results?\n\n*Should a negotiation benefit both parties, both countries?*\n\n&gt; My great desire is that the negotiation after the demand there are neither losers nor winners, that we all win.\n\n*Would that imply that Bolivia would have to give something up?*\n\n&gt; In one of Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era's first speeches in his first term, I think it was at the Summit of Latin American and Caribbean States with Europe, he said that Chile could not give sovereignty, except for economic reasons.\n\n&gt; I do not know if he meant gas, I understand. I just said that as neighboring countries, forever, that is, eternally, we will be neighbors. So why not share what little we have? We need them, maybe they need us, the energy issue is going to be fundamental in a short time, we are willing to open that honest, sincere, responsible dialogue not only to heal wounds , but fundamentally to see beyond, for future generations, with a true friendship, with confidence we can build and appear after so many years of conflict, like two model countries. After years of confrontation, heal wounds and work together.\n\n*There are Chilean congressmen with openness to solve the discussion and within that tendency there is a proposal: a marine enclave with sovereignty in the Pacific in front of a territorial space in Puerto Busch, with sovereignty for Chile, is it a possibility?*\n\n&gt; I do not want to comment on those possibilities, I also have many ideas, I want to be very sincere, we are discussing them internally with the vice president and with other colleagues who know our history, geography, I want them to know that we are ready for the post-Hague scenario.\n\n*To be clear, it is not true then that Bolivia seeks to remove sovereignty to Chile without giving anything in return, Bolivia has negotiating proposals, is not it?*\n\n&gt; We have negotiation proposals, but first we want to know the time that negotiation will take, which representatives will intervene and there must be a guarantor. We went to The Hague because Chile has a policy of procrastination, distraction, and even fun, in the face of this conviction that Bolivia has to resolve the issue once and for all. Sitting with Brother David Choquehuanca when he was chancellor, he told me that he wanted to rest, but he promised that until the end of that year he would leave the country with the sea. I almost laughed. He spoke of parallels, of the first constitutions of Chile, I did not believe, but I gave him my full support. Time passed and it was not like that. In the transmission of command, we had lunch with Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez in 2006. The agent now insinuated that if he stayed a little longer in the government, he left the country with the sea. I want you to understand the Bolivian people. Negotiations were advanced, not always known, with Chile, but when time passed, everything was diluted. That's why I said, another 130 years, not anymore, it's over, and we resort to The Hague for that. In the first steps of Bachelet and Pi\u00f1era there were proposals from the Foreign Ministry to the Foreign Ministry, but later they told me that they were electoral times, that the issue would be politicized and in the end they suspended it, and so we lost four years and then another four years.\n\n*Peru is a country that is in the middle of this problem. Now he has a new president, who has a history because he launched himself as a politician in Moquegua, the region where Ilo is, he has a good relationship with you, can all this help?*\n\n&gt; I spoke with President Alan Garc\u00eda, and he told me that Peru would not harm Bolivia. I spoke with Ollanta Humala, with him we planned that Ilo should be a megaport, we talked alone, from brother to brother, he knows our history, our experience and our ancestors. I spoke with President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, \"I am very sorry about what happened, we are with you,\" he told me. Some did it publicly, others did not. On Friday I called the new president Mart\u00edn Vizcarra, I congratulated him, we talked briefly. Of course, he is Andean, we will certainly have many coincidences, he visited us, we talked a lot and thanks to him the bioceanic train has accelerated rapidly and we have many proposals, such as finishing the road by Milestone 3, we are accelerating. With former President Kuczynski we had planned a bilateral summit this year in Cobija (Pando). We must resume. We are brothers with the same history, the same experiences, the same peoples, of historical struggles.\n\n*The attitude of Governor Rub\u00e9n Costas, who was on his side and then went to other countries in Europe with the issue of 21-F, did it bother him?*\n\n&gt;I do not want to comment, at least for now. We did everything possible, even to lift his roots and to accompany us. We took him to him as the governor who represented the opposition and another to the ruling party, compa\u00f1ero Esteban Urquizu. I save my responsibility, but Costas must explain to his people, the trip was only for the theme of the sea. Here in my residence we once met with the brother governor of Santa Cruz, in his first administration. It was when he treated me as a most excellent murderer, that he was the lesser macaque. We speak clearly, I exhorted him not to offend us, to not humiliate publicly. I told him that it was his right to question my politics and ideology, and vice versa. Since that time I never heard that I was offended publicly. He is known as imperialist, by the group of privatizers, we are anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist. But he was democratically elected and I respect him for that. We coordinate projects, I go and I propose investments in projects, and we have done things. We work together and better because the charges are rendered and last for a limited time.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Evo Morales in recent interview: \"the court can not fail by telling us to give territory with sovereignty, but any negotiation with Chile must have goals and objectives.

{"author":"confusionista","created_utc":1522159555,"num_comments":39,"score":118,"selftext":"Yesterday, I had an interesting conversation with a friend about work in particular and the capitalistic society we live in in general. At some point, both of us wondered: Are we communists? Does the criticism of the existing capitalist system tear us automatically to its opposite \u2013 the idea of communism? I wanted to let you take part in these thoughts. I am definitely no expert on the topic, but as I see it, it can be very helpful to start off the root when talking about big concepts like capitalism and communism. Feel free to criticize and question my thoughts, since they have not reached an end yet, and maybe necessarily never will. Forgive me the length of the text, but I felt like I could not compromize these thoughts further without lacking the necessary background information. \n\nA text, starting with the question whether I am a communist or not, would probably still be viewed as some kind of taboo in some areas of the world, especially in the US, where the hunt for communists had its peak during cold war, but you can still feel the consequences of this modern with hunt nowadays. There, the word communist seems to be used rather as an insult for political enemies instead of a real political and economical alternative to the capitalist societies we live in at the moment. \n\nFor long time, I didn\u2019t call myself a communist. And I still don\u2019t know for sure if that\u2019s what I want to call myself, but the more I read about capitalism, the more it seems obvious to me, that the existing system is a system that is necessarily based on exploitation of various classes of people in the world. If we truly long for freedom, equality and justice between people, we won\u2019t realize it within this system. \nEspecially when talking or writing about big terms like capitalism and communism, it is necessary to start with a somewhat short definition of what I understand when using these two words.\n\nBefore that, it might be helpful to remind ourselves, that both, capitalism and communism, are theoretical systems about how we want to arrange the reproduction of society in a broad sense, and that both ideas have their historical root in certain constellations within space and time. They are no metaphysical terms that lack contact to our everyday lives. The opposite is the case: The existence of words like capitalism and communism is rooted in the reflection on sociological, political and economic relations between human beings. Capitalism hasn\u2019t always been there and it might not be there anymore in a distant future. It is a phase, that human society as a whole goes through and it might reach a different phase sooner or later. \n\nThe most simple definition of capitalism that I read about was the following: Capitalism is an economical system in which a relatively small class of people within the society own the means of production, whereas the majority of people own nothing but their ability to work which they then need to sell to the former group. \nStarting by this definition, it becomes clear, that there is a necessary imbalance between the ones who own capital in some form or another and those who have nothing to offer but their physical or mental abilities. In order to survive, the latter group of people needs to sell their labour to the former ones. \n\nA system like that can by definition never be a system with real equality between people. \n\nThe majority of modern liberal democracies in the world try to cover up this error in some way or another. Concepts like freedom, justice and equality are the regulating ideas of these societies, whereas in reality, these ideas cannot become truth just because of how the capitalist system works. Therefore, ideas like the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d, the idea that even the poorest person within a society can climb up the ladder of classes and become rich by mere effort of that individual, might become true in very few cases but it is an ideological idea in the broad sense.\n\nI am using the term ideological here in the sense that has its root in Marxist theory and was later on defined further by theorists of the Frankfurt School, namely Adorno, Horkheimer and others. When they talk about an ideology, they are not using the word in the sense that someone might call communism or also fascism a political ideology. For them, an ideology is a more complex entity. Regarding the truth value of ideologies in this conception, they have elements that are false and also ones that are true. Here it becomes somewhat complicated: How can a system of thought be true and false at the same time?\n\nLet\u2019s have look at an example: If we take the idea of equality, as already mentioned before, we can see how the idea of equality between all human being is a very tempting one \u2013 in theory. But in the capitalistic societies we live in, this idea will never be truly fulfilled in reality. If only very few people own the means of production and therefore the ability to accumulate more capital \u2013 without labour and only through their existing capital \u2013  they are in a position hugely different from the one of people who own nothing but their ability to work \u2013 for someone else.\n\nAs we see, the idea of equality is true in the sense that it would be wishful to have a system where every human being has the same chances to fulfil their talents, dreams and abilities, but nevertheless, in the reality we live in at the moment, the idea of equality cannot be fulfilled, with makes the idea wrong at the same time. \nIn contrast, thought systems like fascism would not count as ideologies, just because they bear no true aspects within them \u2013 they are nothing more but  So much for ideologies being true and false at the same time.\nBut, ideologies are not only interesting because of their truth value, they are interesting for political theorists, because ideologies have the power to guide people to some degree or another into a certain direction. If we take our example of the idea of equality, we can see, that by believing in ideas like the American Dream, we place the factors of success or failure exclusively within the individual. We say, if you didn\u2019t manage to become a rich and wealthy being, it is simply because of the fact that you as a person are to blame because you didn\u2019t work hard enough for it. \n\nIn contrast, from the perspective of Ideologiekritik, the programme of criticizing existing ideologies in society that was started by the Frankfurt School, not the individual is to blame in these cases, but instead, it is the broader structures of how our society is organized at the moment that gives us the explanation of why so many individuals in the world live in pitiful conditions. If we look at all the technological progress that has been made especially during the last two centuries, it would no longer be necessary anymore, that so many people in the world live in greatest poverty, with no access to education or healthcare whatsoever.\nSo, coming back to defining the terms capitalism and communism, what I understand when talking about communism, is the negation of capitalism. Negation, here, is understood like Hegel defined the term in a dialectical way. History, viewed from a dialectical perspective, is not a straight line leading humanity out of primitive conditions to more and more progress, but instead, it is seen as a struggle of different systems of society, where the following system tries to eradicate the flaws of the former system. Communism, then, would be the reaction (or: negation) to the flaws of capitalism. \n\nCommunism, for me, is not so much a utopia of how a perfect world would look like but rather, I see it as the theoretical attempt to analyse the existing capitalistic system in all its different historical appearances and to uncover its ongoing systematical contradictions. Communism, then, would be the historical decision, to firstly acknowledge these contradictions and, in a second step, to find alternative ways of how human beings can rearrange their material survival. \n \nCommunism, understood like this, could never be a strictly dogmatic system of ideas, far away from reality. Rather, it needs to be as flexible and dynamic as capitalism is itself, to act as a response to it. If we treat it like that, we can also see why so-called real socialism in countries like the Soviet Union was not really a successful attempt to overcome the contradictions of capitalism in order to gain more freedom for people around the world, but rather, it kept alive the imbalance of power relations that we can also find in capitalism. \n\nSo, yes, in this sense, if communism is the wish for more equality and therefore freedom in the world, I'd call myself a communist.\n\n","subreddit":"communism","title":"Am I a communist?"}

I will keep each description brief and provide sources where you can do further research. If you have any suggestions please post them to this thread. Thank you comrades, I hope you can learn something new.\n\nHere are the ones I have posted so far:\n\nAbdul Hamid Khan Bhashani (1880-1976): Nicknamed \"The Red Maulana\" Bhashani was an extremely radical Bengali Revolutionary, anti-imperialist, Islamic communist, and leader &amp; lover of the poor/oppressed. One of the most important figures in in all history but especially south asian history (specifically Bangladesh, India, Pakistan) Further Research: Read \"Moulana Bhashani Leader of the Toiling Masses\" (available on Amazon) his wikipedia is also a good starting point https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Hamid_Khan_Bhashani\n\nHadj-Ali Abelkader (Born 1883): An Algerian communist, anti-imperialist , nationalist and revolutionary. At the time of his birth, Algeria was a colony of France that was subjected to slave-like conditions from it's colonizer. Hadj-Ali fled Algeria to go to France with anti-imperialist views in mind, trying to find a way to free his country. He created \u00c9toile Nord-Africaine (North African Star, or ENA) a political party which fought for every north african country that was colonized by european powers. He was so radical for his time that even the French Communist Party kicked him out for his extreme anti-imperialist views and for his views on self-determination. Further Reading: an amazing article written about him is here - https://isreview.org/issue/105/hadj-ali-abelkader-muslim-communist-1920s\n\nLeila Khaled - A Palestinian freedom fighter, refugee, intersectional-feminist and a revolutionary. A picture of her holding an AK-47 at the age of 25 after hijacking an israeli plane (killing no one just demanding her voice to be heard) became an important icon for all revolutionaries. She was part of the communist/marxist-leninist element of PLO called Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_Khaled\n\nKwame Nkrumah - A communist revolutionary, pan africanist and the first president &amp; prime minister of Ghana who led Ghana to independence from the British. Influenced by the likes of African American thinkers such as WEB Du Bois, Kwame decolonized Ghana, nationalized the country, set up a strong education system, promoted unity (pan-africanism) opposed western interference and European colonization within Africa.  But due to his anti-imperialist policies and pan-africanist views he was overthrown by an American backed coup in 1996 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwame_Nkrumah#Overthrow\n\nPatrice Lumumba - A Pan Africanist nationalist, who ended Belgian colonization in the Republic of Congo and changed the countries name to Democratic Republic of Congo to reflect self-determination and the will of it's people. Prior to his presidency Congo as it's entirety had been enslaved and colonized by Belgium and it's leader King Leopold. King Leopold led one of the worst genocides in history within the Congo killing over millions. Children from the Congo were even sold to the Bronx zoo and were exhibited in cages for the American public to see. A literal \"Human Zoo\" Lumumba brought self determination, democracy, and Pan-Africanism to his country. He was executed with involvement from Belgium, United States and the British. A true martyr for the Pan-Africanist movement. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba\n\nOmar Mukhtar - One of the bravest and legendary resistance fighters of all time. Umar was a Libyan berber and a religious Muslim revolutionary who fought the Italian facists colonists in Libya in order to free his country. Hed led native resistance against the Colonial Italians. He was an international revolutionary humanitarian as he fought against the French colonization of Chad and even the British Colonization of Egypt. He was captured by the Facist Italians under White supremacist leader Mussolini and barbarically hung in public display to discourage resistance against facism and nazi rule. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Mukhtar\n\nGamal Abdel Nasser - A revolutionary, anti-imperialist, Pan-arab &amp; Pan african leader as well as the second president of Egypt. Nasser freed Egypt from British colonial rule, he abolished the monarchy, and socialized the Egypt and it's economy. He secured the independence of Sudan and fought wars against imperialist to free Muslim countries from colonization. His direct actions led to the unification of North and South Yemen (occupied by the British) He transformed Egypt into a central planned economy and waster hated by Israel and western countries. He led efforts to free Palestine by fighting wars against Israeli and imperialist powers.

Rivera was a Puerto Rican who believed Puerto Rico should have self-determination and be free instead of a neo-colony of Amerikkka. He believed Amerikka had a parasitic and one-sided relationship with Puerto Rico that kept his people poor and opressed. He fought for Puerto Rico's freedom through violent and non-violent means. He was eventually imprisoned and became one of the longest serving political prisoners of all time. He was singled out for his political views in prison and spent a record 12 years in solitary confinement (I don't know how he survived that). Millions of Puerto Ricans and supporters of Rivera cried out against these injustices and demanded his freedom. Under pressure, neo-liberal president Barack Obama commuted his sentence and he was let out in 2017. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_L%C3%B3pez_Rivera\n\nAbd el-Krim - Father of Guerrilla Warfare. DIRECTLY inspired Mao Zedong, Che gueverra, and Ho Chi Minh.

If she succeeds, she will follow in a long line of celebrities-turned-politicians including Sonny Bono, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jesse Ventura and most notably, Presidents Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump. [...] attempts in last year\u2019s election campaign to create a personality cult out of Theresa May, Britain\u2019s prime minister, failed dismally because she is a shy and reserved person.  [...] A celebrity, by contrast, has the benefit of instant name recognition and knows how to speak directly to the public. Like Reagan before him, Mr Trump uses simple language and expresses issues in black and white terms. [...] The celebrity leader could work if they merely play the role of a front man (or woman); a non-executive chair of the board. Reagan very much played that role in the 1980s. All the difficult decisions can be left to experts. Independent central banks already control many of the levers of economic policy. Other tough areas, like pensions or environment, can be hived off to commissions. Like a reality TV show, the public can then vote for the character they like most to present the show, and vote them off when they get bored. Rather than \u201cKing for a day\u201d, celebrities will be King or Queen for four years. \nThe risk, of course, is that celebrities may not realise their own limitations, and think they are experts, regardless of their lack of knowledge.\"\n\nThe article can be found [here](https://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2018/03/democracy-and-economics)","subreddit":"communism","title":"Bits from a new article in the Economist about the future of democracy"}

A week or so later I come back from school only to notice that some things had been moved about in my room. I knew something was up, so I went and checked the shelf.

I could just tell them the truth, but I feel that the consequences will be extremely harsh, so I'm reluctant. On the other hand, I could wait until they confront me, and then tell them.
