Never had any justice, so the ensuing complex PTSD wrecked havoc.\n\n\nI've been a communist nearly my whole life because even the concept of private property sends me into flashbacks of being \u201cowned\u201d by someone.  Very early I learned extremes of dignity.\n\n\nI've been in and out of various gangs, some communist, some just based in solidarity.  I tried school with partial financial aid (abuse situation), but it led to further radicalisation from poverty.\n\n\nMy PTSD and health got so bad, I had to quit all surface illegal activity.  I moved cross-country to Colorado so I could use medical without consumerist traps of drug dealing (went from 1000 in weed a month to 100-150).\n\n\nUnfortunately the only \u201cfamily\u201d I had betrayed me and stole thousands (I guess going clean didn't sit well).  This led me to homelessness which I barely crawled out of.  I literally don't have anyone else, and they knew it.\n\n\nI'm working a stable job, but housing by myself is too costly to sustain.  Not to mention my vulnerability allows capitalists to hawk me.  They smell my disunity with the population, I swear.  Currently I pay above average rent and have no refrigerator.  I had to take the offer because of cashflow/felony.  (Record about to be clean!)  Luckily my lease is up in 2 months.\n\n\nThis leads into why I don't just \u201cfind a roommate\u201d. The biggest problem is my PTSD.  I never stop working on it, but I can't get over non-socialists.  Either I'm peacefully converting them or trying to STAY AWAY.\n\n\nI'm past hatred of democratic socialists etc because I'm honestly asking myself \u201cWho are my friends?  Who are my enemies?\u201d  So I'm over the extremism, but I can't shake intolerance of people who embrace child abuse (capitalist adherents).\n\n\nI have been building repertoire with local parties, but 99.9% of the people I encounter aren't in a do-or-die struggle.  Maybe after a much longer period it will be viable to house with them, but forthright asking for housing solidarity is met with suspicion.\n\n\n\n\nAnd I understand.  I am a drifter with no family and few acquaintances, who used to be lumpenproletariat.  But what am I to do?  Depression sets in every time I'm charged $50 for my bank account being 0.02 cents short.  I can't afford to live alone! Yet, I was just thrust into it.\n\n\nHousing with non-Marxists is out of the question.  It seems absurd, but I've been in too many physical confrontations with people for espousing Marxist thinking.  And as an abuse victim I can't just \u201cignore\u201d someone using triggering language like \u201cfuck poor people\u201d.  My physical safety is at risk, and theirs.\n\n\nAnd for Marxist roommates I have been using Craigslist ads, but all the answers are about hippie stuff and weed.  Nothing to do with Marxism.  But I'm holding out for finding a Marxist roommate.  I will move ANYWHERE with weed, and possibly without it if I can find a solidarity party.\n\n\nIt seems growing out of lumpenproletariat left me isolated.  Any tips?  I have been improving my conversation skills and friendliness, but there's only so much I can do in my present situation.  I'm stuck in the work-starve cycle, for now.  If anyone feels me maybe we could link up.  Or even a cell-based party willing to take a risk?","subreddit":"communism","title":"Trouble with housing, advice?"}

And there were many smaller Boris Yeltsins.  So I am interested in Marxist explanations as to how this degeneration occurred in the Party, as well as other aspects of the fall of USSR.  We must study these things so that we can do better next time, and also so that we can engage all people, including non-communists with real historical analysis and information about \"actually existing socialism\".

{"author":"intlnews","created_utc":1513008062,"num_comments":3,"score":23,"selftext":"Below is reprinted an interview which was originally printed in [an edition](http://www.italic.org/ItalicWay/editions/XLI_web.pdf) of The [Italic Way](http://www.italic.org/ItalicWay/articles.php), a publication of the Italic Institute of America. It talks about Michael Parenti's early life, with the interview originally done in 2015:\n\n&gt; Michael Parenti, born 82 years ago in what was then the biggest\n\u201cLittle Italy\u201d of them all (Manhattan\u2019s East Harlem, aka Italian,\nnow Spanish, Harlem), grew up to become one of America\u2019s lead-\ning political thinkers. He has written 25 books and more than 300\narticles, all of them giving a unique Parenti-esque spin on history,politics and economics. His writing is at once scholarly and accessible, using down-to-earth, often humorous language to explain complex concepts. Now a resident of Berkeley, California, he is still actively writing and lecturing.  \n\n&gt; The Italic Way (IW): How wouldyou define \u201cprogressive radical?\u201d \n\n&gt; Michael Parenti (MP): A progressive radical is someone who supports democratic political procedures rather   than   moneyed-driven   ones, much   needed   human   services,   public ownership of education, utilities, industrial production, and most financing, while opposing big corporate power and global imperialism. \n\n&gt; IW: You grew up in East Harlem when it was the largest Italian\nneighborhood on this side of the Atlantic. Was that a positive or negative experience?\n\n&gt; MP: By its nature, I would say that any large Italian neighborhood would be a mix of positive and negative experiences. The neighborhood had a toughness to it but it was also familiar, fairly safe, and lively. I used to shudder at the sterile environments of suburban areas and the antiseptic middle-class neighborhoods on the rare occasions I visited them. East Harlem was a place of humble origin, poor, hardworking people, nothing to be ashamed of. But as I got into my teens, East Harlem began to feel like a provincial world and I longed for other experiences and wider horizons.\n\n&gt; IW: Tell me about your parents. What were they like? Were they\nsupportive? Did they speak Italian at home? Where in Italy were\nthey   from?   Was   life   in   your   home   more   \u201cAmerican\u201d   or   more \u201cItalian?\u201d\n\n&gt; MP: My parents were hardworking Italian Americans who spoke\nEnglish at home except when they wanted to say something confi-\ndential to each other or when they conversed with their immigrant\nparents; then they used their southern Italian dialects (some of\nwhich I could decipher as they spoke). My father was Barese and\nmy mother was Calabrese. They were tolerant of my inclinations to\nplay sports and street games, and read books and adventure magazines. They were happy and proud when I graduated high school but they never urged me to go on to college.  Higher education simply was not part of their world view.\n\n&gt; IW: It\u2019s well known that you hold a Ph.D.   in   political   science   from Yale, but   where   did   you   go   to   elementary school, high school, and college? And were there many other Italians at these schools? Were   you   draw   to   other Italians growing up and in school?\n\n&gt; MP: I attended a somewhat rundown public school located in East Harlem, consisting almost entirely of Italian boys. I went to De Witt Clinton High School where most of the students were Jewish, not many Italians. Same with College of New York where I got my B.A. I was first introduced to the upper class Anglo-Protestant world at Brown University, an Ivy League school, where I got my master\u2019s degree, and then on to Yale. Not many Italians crossed my path in those institutions.  But I never avoided the ones who did.\n\n&gt; IW: Why do you think you became a progressive radical? Did the\nlikes of Leonard Covello, Fiorello LaGuardia, Vito Marcantonio\nand Carlo Tresca influence you? Did you have any direct dealings\nwith any of them or other Italians like them?\n\n&gt; MP: I had no direct contact with such notables or others like them, although a couple of times I did hear Marcantonio speak from a sound truck during his campaigns. I shook his hand once - he was my Congressman; my father liked him a lot.  I became a liberal and later on a militant radical largely because of the segregation issue. I\u2019m convinced that my own ethnic and class experiences as a working-class   Italian American,   who   was   relatively   marginalized   in society, left me with a lot of sympathy and understanding for the African-American struggle, and a lot of anger against the terrible oppressions of racism and Jim Crow.  I also think my ingrained regard for people who are being unfairly and sometimes brutally mistreated played a big role. And I had no use for Joe McCarthy. Then came the Vietnam War, which I found to be a criminal horror. It caused me to engage in numerous protest actions at the street level, some of which proved physically injurious and career damaging.\n\n&gt; IW: In Waiting for Yesterday: Pages from a Street Kid\u2019s Life, your recent   memoir,   you   mentioned   that   well-educated   people   who would   never   use   an   ethnic   slur directed at other groups did not hesitate to make anti-Italian comments\nin your presence. Why do you think this is so? Why do you think non-Italians   have   so   little   empathy   for Italians and Italian Americans?\n\n&gt; MP: Many   of   the   Italians   who migrated here came without a penny to their name. They were\u2014in the fevered imaginations of Anglo-Protestant Americans\u2014the low-life, unwashed, swarthy hoards given to crime, violence, and ignorance. The association of Italian Americans with organized crime has been repeatedly propagated over the years by congressional hearings, news media, television series such as The Untouchables and The Sopranos\nalong with books and films like The Godfather.  The impression left in the minds of millions is that the association is justified. A few hundred mafiosi are treated as representative of 20 million law-abiding Italian Americans.  Added to that are the dimwitted illiterate \u201cFonzi\u201d and \u201cGuido\u201d stereotypes. Meanwhile the accomplishments of Italian Americans in the arts, entertainment,   science,   commerce,   social   sciences,   law,   labor organizing, social activism, and numerous other fields go unnoticed and are frozen out of the mainstream media. \n\n&gt; IW: Why haven\u2019t Italian Americans   developed   an effective response to anti-Italianism, the way other groups   have   to   negative stereotypes   and   prejudicial comments directed at them?\n\n&gt; MP: Some Italian American groups actually have hit back with\nindignant declarations and protest letters regarding the stereotypic\nportrayals of stock characters and derogatory terms used to characterize Italians. But their efforts have been given scant attention in the   mainstream   press.   Non-Italians   I   have   talked   to,   including politically progressive individuals, tend to think that biases and slurs   against   Italians   are   few   and   far   between   and   \u201care   not   as important   as   women\u2019s   issues   and gay rights,\u201d as one radical feminist told   me.   I   responded   (with admirable restraint) that  all denigrations   and   group   prejudices   are   in need of our attention and are not to be   ignored,   for   silence   implies acceptance, and there is no room for acceptance of any kind of bigotry. \n\n&gt; IW: You have traveled in Italy. What were your impressions of the country and the people?\n\n&gt; MP: I first traveled through parts of Italy in 1951 not long after\nWorld War II.  The people seemed friendlier than in France and\nEngland (the other two countries I had visited). The Italians were\nkeenly   aware   of   their   war-caused   deprivations,   yet   they   still dressed rather tastefully.  Not until 50 years later did I make my next trip to Italy.  I noticed that the young males no longer stood on street corners to hound and whistle at the young females. Now that sexual mores were much less repressive, sexual behavior was also much more mature.\n\n&gt; IW: Why do you think Fascism developed in Italy? What does\nFascism say about the Italian character?\n\n&gt; MP: I   don\u2019t   believe   Fascism   revealed   anything   distinctly\nflawed about the Italian character as such.  Any people in the aftermath of the Great War, suffering terrible losses, can be led astray, not all of them but enough of them. The advent of Fascism did reveal a lot about the oppressive nature of Italian class society, and about the existence of a socialist movement   that   was   strong   but   not   strong   enough   to   win   state power.  I believe that substantial portions of Italian society, much of the working class, some of the middle class, and almost all of the\nintelligentsia had no love for il Duce.\n\n&gt; IW: What has the German-led austerity program done to Italy?\nAnd   is   Italy   really   as   bad   off   economically   as   Greece,   Spain, Portugal and Ireland?\n\n&gt; MP: Italy is a social democracy, less prosperous and more corrupt than   northern   European   countries   like   Norway   or   Finland   but somewhat better off than Greece, Portugal, and Spain (or so it was some years back). Austerity always comes on the backs of the working poor and is targeted against a nation\u2019s hard-won social programs. The problem may not be Germany as such but the ruling interests of these various countries (with the German elites leading the way) who use the European Union as an instrument to limit the social gains of the working classes of every country within the EU.   \n\n&gt; IW: A large percentage of today\u2019s Italian Americans are right of\ncenter. Considering the history of Italians in America and in Italy\u2014\njob and housing discrimination, lynching in New Orleans and else-\nwhere, labor activism in the New York garment industry and in the\nstrikes   in   Lawrence,   Mass.,   and   Patterson,   N.J.,   the   Sacco   and Vanzetti   tragedy,   the   mafia   stigma,   and   a   century   of   unabated depiction in the media and entertainment industries as criminals and buffoons, plus the downfall of Fascism in Italy\u2014don\u2019t you think this is odd?\n\n&gt; MP: The Italians in America were too busy trying to make a living\nto concern themselves with trying to make history. They did rela-\ntively little if anything for Sacco and Vanzetti or for other struggles\nthat featured their besieged ethnic kin. In recent times their heavi-\nly conventional ways have led them to be American super-patriots\nand Reagan Democrats, worried more about crime, drugs, \u201cwelfare\nchiselers,\u201d and same-sex marriages and less about the corporate\nprofiteers who are the ones who are really sticking it to us.   \n\n&gt; IW: Why do Italian Americans have little or no appreciation of\ntheir   classical   heritages,   namely   Ancient   Rome   and   the\nRenaissance, and only an immigrant consciousness? Greeks, Jews, Germans, Irish and others seem to be much more aware of their\ndeeper heritage.\n\n&gt; MP: As Italians we have as much right to be proud of our heritage as any other national group. I enjoy my heritage, be it from Ancient Rome to Renaissance Italy and beyond. But I also appreciate the human endeavors and achievements put forth by many other civilizations. The celebration of one\u2019s heritage should not come at the expense   of   anyone   else\u2019s. But   you   are   right,   many   Italian Americans have no interest or information regarding both their long past history and their more recent history. Like other ethnic groups, the Italians in America have largely acculturated to the existing mass media culture. Like people of various backgrounds, Italian Americans are seriously involved in consumerism and maintaining a suitably middle-class lifestyle. There is nothing wrong with wanting to live comfortably or decently. But it is unfortunate that it is too often coupled with apolitical inertia and a limited conventional consciousness. My friend, Richard Vanucci, himself a conservative (who reads books and refuses to use a computer) says, \u201cAs a folk we are our own worst enemy.\u201d  It\u2019s \u201cFrank Sinatra,\u201d Jersey   Shore,   and   boundless   consumerism   without   any   effort devoted to our history in this country and the old country, Vanucci believes. I   agree,   but   I   think   there   are   a   lot   of   quality   Italian\nAmerican writers and social activists, and worthy organizations\nand publications, The Italic Way being one.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Michael Parenti, an Intellectual with a Common Touch"}

The guy calls himself a communist. The trouble is that his version of communism differs slightly form the one I am accustomed to. In his words: \"If being a communist means to defend, today, the twentieth century communism, my answer would be no (I am not a communist).\" For him to be a communist is to identify with contemporary movements like Occupy, he states it quite clearly in the interview. \n\nNow, let me contrast his attitude with the following words from Zizek's preface to Mao's works: \"(...)if one submits the Marxist past to a ruthless critique, one has first to acknowledge it as \u2018one\u2019s own\u2019, taking full responsibility for it, not to comfortably get rid of the \u2018bad\u2019 turn of things by way of attributing it to a foreign intruder (the \u2018bad\u2019 Engels who was too stupid to understand Marx\u2019s dialectics, the \u2018bad\u2019Lenin who didn\u2019t get the core of Marx\u2019s theory, the \u2018bad\u2019 Stalin who spoils the noble plans of the \u2018good\u2019 Lenin, etc.).\nThe first thing to do, then, is to fully endorse the displacement in the history of Marxism concentrated in two great passages (or, rather, violent cuts): the passage from Marx to Lenin, as well as the passage from Lenin to Mao.\"\n\nLet me get to the point (if there is one). I am sharing this with you, comrades, because I am outraged and perplexed. I am outraged at the easiness with which a distinguished historian simply nullifies two revolutions and all that they have achieved. I am perplexed, because I simply can't understand the logic behind such a statement. \n\nI think that's pretty symptomatic for people considering themselves 'left'. They want Communism without Party, Revolution without Violence... What comes next? Obviously, one can do away with statements like this one simply by branding them trotskyist deviation, but how to combat this form of watering down of the communist idea and its past?\n\nEDIT: To all the comrades criticizing me for wanting to discuss an interview that appeared in bourgeois El Pais: I think that monitoring liberal media and detecting the many subtle ways by which ideology operates is as essential as fighting it. In fact, the outcome of the latter depends on the quality of the former. \n\"To hear incorrect views without rebutting them and even to hear counter-revolutionary remarks without reporting them, but instead to take them calmly as if nothing had happened: this is a sixth type [of liberalism].\"","subreddit":"communism","title":"Coffee without caffeine, Communism without Party"}

In Eastern Europe, capitalist counter-revolution led to the greatest population loss in modern history.\u201d\n\n-Eastern Europe was divided among the Western powers and their compradors; China\u2019s bourgeoisie is independent from control of the West precisely because of the independence won through the struggles of its period of socialist construction. (Here is a good article explaining that in more detail: http://www.bannedthought.net/China/Capitalism-Imperialism/FredEngst-RiseOfChina.pdf)\n\nA basic Marxist analysis understands that capitalism, when allowed to develop independently, will bring prosperity and development relative to the period of underdevelopment which precedes it (relative to the preceding underdevelopment is the key word here). Although the development will be uneven, especially in the rural areas. The main question, however, is which class *owns* the development. \n\nIn China, the people do not have command over production, the global market does. Production and prices are not determined by need or by Party directives, but are determined by the global market and the interests of the owners of enterprise. For example, in 1979, enterprises were allowed to distribute profit freely, instead of the state. In 1984, the CPC decides to give the managers of enterprise a number of unprecedented freedoms, which effectively allowed for the commodification of production (a problem that Stalin warned about in the USSR as well, back in the early 1950s). See page 10-11 in this 18 June 1984 Peking Review:\nhttp://www.massline.org/PekingReview/PR1984/PR1984-25.pdf.\n\nThis is when 5-year plans no longer decided what must be produced, but instead allowed the markets to decide. Workers begin producing for the capitalist world system, instead of the needs of the people.\nIn August of the same year, large and medium-sized retail shops no longer have to turn over their profits to the State, instead they just have to pay taxes. The commercial sector is opened up so as to allow greater freedom of small commerce. This is to address problems created by the initial period of reforms, a classic capitalist solution to problems it creates (Pages 4-5).\nhttp://www.massline.org/PekingReview/PR1984/PR1984-35.pdf\n\nIn 1992, Party leaders are encouraged to open up their own businesses.\n\nIn 1995, a law was passed that said: \"a commercial bank has the right to run itself as a commercial entity and to be responsible for its own risks,\" said ICBC (China's biggest bank) Chairman Yi Huiman in 2016, when asked about the relation between commercial banks and SOEs, and the State. He also adds that since 1995, \"there has been little to no intervention in the commercial lending decision making of a commercial bank by the government.\" You can read the full interview here:\nhttp://www.theasianbanker.com/updates-and-articles/interview:-%E2%80%9Cicbc-china-incoming-chairman-yi-huiman-hints-at-broad-organisational-restructuring-to-strengthen-risk-and-controls%E2%80%9D \n\nYou can also read the 1995 law in full right here:\nhttp://www.china.org.cn/english/DAT/214824.htm \n\nIn 2001, the 'Three Represents' officially allow businessmen into the Party.\n\nSince 2011, a number of huge reforms have occurred, as well- so you know this isn't just a product of the post-Soviet world attempting to survive. The third plenum of the 18th Party Congress set a huge reform into practice- giving markets \"the decisive function of allocating resources.\" A number of other liberal reforms occurred, too- including \"endow peasants with more property rights.\" You can read the full communique here:\nhttps://chinacopyrightandmedia.wordpress.com/2013/11/12/communique-of-the-3rd-plenum-of-the-18th-party-congress/ \n\nThe entire document constantly stresses the need for modernization and liberalization, more pressing than ever. Aside from the rhetoric of giving people \"more democratic freedoms,\" there is nothing in the document to suggest actual socialist, proletarian politics are in command. This was in 2013, and was an effort led by everyone's fave Xi Jinping.\n\nIn 2015, China \"unveiled a guideline to divide the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into strictly commercial entities and those that serve governmental ends, such as power and healthcare suppliers.\"\nhttp://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-12/29/c_134962258.htm \n\nThis means that the CPC basically approved the breaking up and privatization of SOEs. This is a trend that can easily be traced back to 1984, the breaking-up of SOEs and allowing for more private enterprise.\nThere is a certain degree of control the Party does have over the economy, with certain goals that are set during the Party Congresses. But the Party itself has let so many of the bourgeoisie into its ranks, both through direct recruitment and through development of capitalist productive forces, that it cannot be accurately described as an advanced expression of the organized proletariat. \n\nYou simply cannot develop capitalism while also developing socialism. The interests of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are inherently opposed to each other. I\u2019m not denying that China hasn\u2019t developed a high standard of living since 1978, I\u2019m arguing that it has been developing capitalism. Also important to mention, when it comes to increasing wages, there is the question of extraction of surplus value from the periphery. While it is not as great or harmful as what the Western bloc does, it still exists, and because of this extraction (and flooding of cheap manufactured goods into African markets), the working class of China can be afforded higher wages.\n\nOf course, higher wages do not mean acceptable working conditions and living conditions for all of China\u2019s workers. In fact, income inequality is even greater in China than it is the US (the extremes of which you acknowledge in your article). http://www.massline.org/Dictionary/GI.htm\n\nIn many rural areas, labor suffers greatly in abusive factories for cheap pay. The unavailability of other forms of work (coupled with high unemployment) pacifies workers into submission. You won\u2019t find workers in rural areas organizing to the same degree that workers in the cities are. Compare this to the development of the People\u2019s Communes during the Great Leap Forward, which prioritized the development of the forces of production in rural areas under socialist, common ownership, as opposed to bourgeois development. (I\u2019m aware of the many criticisms and mistakes of the GLF, as was Mao. However, as a result of those policies, the standard of life rose dramatically and it set the stage for the future development of the forces of production, which would have taken much longer if not for the foundation established).\n\n&gt; \u201cprecisely because China\u2019s economy is not dominated by the capitalist need to maximize profit.\u201d\n\n-This argument would make sense, if not for the fact that China simply does not control or dictate anywhere near the same amount of oil as the US does. It would not make sense from a business standpoint to try and take over a heavily monopolized industry where even a sovereign country like Venezuela still has the price of their own nationalized oil exports controlled by the global market (even though China has the oil rights to a small number of African countries). A much better, and profitable, business opportunity would be to heavily invest in a market that the US simply has not. Besides, global warming and pollution affect the Chinese bourgeoisie, too- much more severely than any in the West do. Chinese billionaires don\u2019t want to breathe in smog.\n\nChinese private enterprise does not have its roots in oil and petroleum like the US does. Why would it change that? Further, by the same logic, you could argue that countries like Denmark and Germany are also socialist because they have been heavily investing in renewable energy and provide social services like healthcare, education, and high wages.\n\nOf course, we recognize socialism as being a class dictatorship over the bourgeoisie, which is not true in any of those countries, and it cannot be true in a country like China if, for the past 40 years, they have been developing the forces of production under the guidance of the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe other problem with your statement is exactly what I have mentioned previously: the market has in fact been the primary source for the direction of production, the prices of commodities, and the labor created. This has been consistent policy since 1979.\n\n&gt; \u201cWhile capitalists exist in China today, unlike in capitalist societies, they are isolated and not organized in pursuit of their collective interests.\u201d\n\n-This question goes right to the heart of most objections to the claim that China is still on the socialist road. It is of vital importance. Class struggle is what defines the period of socialism, and what will eventually lead to communism. The experience of the Cultural Revolution proved that the bourgeoisie were not external to China, as was falsely believed in the USSR, but that they were not only internal to China, but in fact had managed to represent themselves in the Party.\n\nMao\u2019s call to \u201cBombard the Headquarters!\u201d was a rallying cry to this fact. The entire Cultural Revolution was waged over this. Of course, if you subscribe to the Dengist line that class struggle was not the primary contradiction, that instead the underdevelopment of the forces of production was, then you probably reject Mao\u2019s ideas on this subject. (http://www.massline.org/PekingReview/PR1976/PR1976-16e.htm) \n\n(See also a criticism of \u2018Taking the Three Directives as Key Link: http://www.massline.org/PekingReview/PR1976/PR1976-14b.htm)\n \nThat would contradict you when you say that \u201cthey exist under the rule of the socialist state to aid national economic development.\u201d The bourgeoisie will always attempt to reorganize society in their interests. When they are both in the Party and when they can control enterprise through the market, how are they not organizing for their full restoration?\n\nWhile it is true that Chinese workers do take CEOs hostage, this is less to do with CPC policy and more to do with the revolutionary will of the masses. The period of socialist construction and the intensified class struggle waged during the GPCR molded the Chinese proletariat into a class of revolutionary-minded people. If the CPC strictly punished the rights of workers to fight for their interests in the workplace, there would be massive unrest. Capitalism sustains itself by appealing to workers as much as possible, while stripping away the foundations and the legal basis of proletarian organization. For example, only 20% of the Chinese workforce is represented by state-owned enterprise. (https://www.economist.com/news/china/21588899-chinas-leaders-will-soon-reveal-their-ambitions-economic-reform-long-weekend)\n\nWhen the Party endorses the total privatization of the economy, the workers will inevitably lose their ability to organize. The reason why, as Marxist-Leninists, we understand the need for a vanguard Party is that for the class struggle to intensify and completely overthrow the bourgeoisie for good, a democratic-centralist organization must exist which unites all revolutionary struggles across the country and can advance the political development of the masses forward into communism. When the Party no longer represents the interests of the proletariat, and no longer exists as a tool of dictatorship of the proletariat, then the bourgeoisie will use that Party to reorganize that society in their own interests. This is exactly what happened in the USSR over a period of several decades, and it\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening in China. https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/1964/phnycom.htm\n\nIt is taking much longer, though, precisely because of the advanced stage of the revolution committed to under the Maoist-era leadership, which continues to affect the political consciousness of the Chinese people today, who resist and organize against increasing liberalization (while in many cases also being arrested for it).\n\n&gt; \u201cWhile the reforms have presented new contradictions for China \u2014 particularly, greater income inequality \u2014 the Communist Party recognizes these challenges and works hard to address them.\u201d\n\nIncome inequality cannot be resolved under capitalism. The accumulation of capital and profit drives the bourgeoisie forward. These contradictions are contradictions of capitalism, and can only be resolved through socialism. It is my opinion that Xi Jinping was forced to recognize the uneven development of the forces of production at the 19th Party Congress (and declared it the new primary contradiction) after several decades of the CPC ignoring it because the people in the countryside demand a better standard of living. I\u2019m going to defer to a 1976 issue of Peking review, which explains that the principal contradiction in socialist society is always going to be between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat: https://www.marxists.org/subject/china/peking-review/1976/PR1976-25.pdf\n\n&gt; \u201cPresident Xi Jinping has called for efforts to deepen understandings of Marxism\u201d\nThis is objectively a good thing. I\u2019m not here to slander everything the CPC does. I\u2019m here to argue that the CPC is on the capitalist road. But I do question the authenticity of the statement. The burden of proof is on the CPC and Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership. If Xi Jinping commits the Party to the mass-line, as he has promised, then a socialist restoration can occur. I have faith in China to set about on this task, and I earnestly wish Xi Jinping all success in these endeavors. But I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible without first overthrowing the bourgeoisie within the Party and developing the forces of production according to basic socialist principles. As a student of Marxism-Leninism at university, I am positive that he understands this. It just doesn\u2019t seem like a real commitment is being made to achieve those ends, if the liberalization of the economy continues its current trajectory. Remember that even Gorbachev believed he was a Communist.\n\n&gt; \u201cChina is the primary force building a multipolar, more democratic international order, ending 500 years of Western imperial dominance.\u201d\n\nIt is true that China represents a direct threat to US-led imperialism. This is an objective truth. It can\u2019t really be debated, and I agree wholeheartedly with it. However, capitalist-imperialism is a world-system. It is a universal development of capitalism, not unique to the US. The way that the US has implemented it is certainly unique, and no other nation compares to its horrific legacy. All of this is true. As such, Chinese capitalist development in the global south represents a progressive rupture from Western-led imperialism. But just because trade deals are not being forced by gunpoint, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not that same universal development of capitalist-imperialism.\n\nIf Chinese production is according to the whims of the global market, then this also means that Chinese production is being directed by capitalist-imperialism. This also means that China\u2019s relationship with the global south resembles that of an industrialized nation dictating the terms of other economies for the enrichment of its own national bourgeoisie. While there are certainly amazing advances that have come about from this relationship, as it is still a progressive rupture from US imperialism, it will eventually lead to much greater uneven development. In the Maoist-era, there actually were projects which were constructed in Africa as genuine gifts to the people. For example, in Zambia, a $500 million railway was constructed (called the Tazara Railway), completely financed by China as a gift to ease the financial burden of the land-locked country against white colonial rule. Today, the development is in China\u2019s favor. While infrastructure in Zambia is still being developed by China, Zambian exports to China are an essential component of this. Zambia in effect structures its economy to export to China. This closely resembles a colonial relationship. There have been a number of problems with Chinese-owned mines in Zambia. This article goes over some of them: https://qz.com/999630/china-and-zambia-are-in-a-diplomatic-clash-over-illegal-copper-mining/\n\nPerhaps the argument can be made that this is necessary for world socialism, the proletarianization of the world\u2019s workers, and that socialism cannot be achieved without first building capitalism. I think this is the essence of Deng\u2019s ideology. But it is decisively wrong. The development of revolutionary base areas during the civil war and the united front against Japanese imperialism proves that the peasantry can build socialism and liberate themselves, free from capitalist development. Many also argue that the idea that socialism must necessarily come from capitalism is a Eurocentric one, reflecting the West\u2019s colonial domination over the global south and its own enrichment at their expense.\n\nAgain, my argument is not that China hasn\u2019t succeeded, but that they are developing capitalism, not socialism. If you want to make the argument that it\u2019s what\u2019s best for China- that\u2019s perfectly understandable, but you\u2019re making an argument for the development of Chinese capitalism, not for the merits of the dictatorship of the proletariat. And I will argue that the standard of life would have continued to increase under the period of socialist construction if it had been allowed to continue, in addition to intensifying the class struggle.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4331212/\n\nhttp://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=58B399C3CA70411186D2AD96230D649A\n\nhttp://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=5ba75f3113b0e1e4f36fc587ddfe2826\n\nOne more word about China\u2019s relationship with the global south. If China was so interested only in the betterment of other nations, why would it uphold sanctions against DPRK? Why would it ban tourism to it? Why would it provide arms to the Duterte government who is involved in cracking down on a genuine revolutionary communist movement? This sounds more like a country led by a national bourgeoisie invested in its own business interests than an internationalist proletarian one.","subreddit":"communism","title":"My Response to Ajit Singh's 'China: A Revolutionary Present.'"}

I understand the basis of why intersectionality was formulated to provide a more radical avenue for marginalized sub-groups of the proletariat, but with this formulation it appears to have rigidly stratified these groups as if they are fundamentally different, and not categorically arbitrary. If women have a fundamental essence that makes them outside of the realm of men, and vice versa, how can a women's movement also be a proletarian movement. Same goes for race, as it was also a blurred construct, in this case of the barbarous, Trans-Atlantic slavery. If \"black\" people have a fundamental essence which rigidly removes them from white society, and again vice versa, how can a proletarian movement toss away a false, but simultaneously, real category.\n\nI am inclined to believe that the death of class politics that we are witnessing is rooted in false necessities of production, as the critical theorists argued, but also in the fragmentation of these sub-groups. \n\nIs it possible to reinvigorate a new, non-essentialist left, and what would that even look like?

Its just about exactly what you would expect, irrelevant or misconstrued data nearly three hours and a lot of research later, I have come up with this: Comrades, behold **debunking resources for anti-communism**\n\n\n1: \nThe Communist Manifesto: I don\u2019t know why this is here, but alright. Maybe I misjudged this list?\n\n\n2: \n2 fiction novels (Solzhenitsyn) (No, didn\u2019t misjudge it)\nNo comment. Using fiction to attempt to delegitimize a political ideology is ridiculous. Especially fiction by an anti-Semitic monarchist. This so called \"first hand account\" is nothing more than a collection of politically convenient rumours.  I think il take his wife's word for it *Natalya Reshetovskaya, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's first wife, wrote in her memoirs that \"The Gulag Archipelago\" was based on \"campfire folklore\" as opposed to objective facts. She wrote that she was perplexed that the Western media had accepted The Gulag Archipelago as \"the solemn, ultimate truth\", saying that its significance had been \"overestimated and wrongly appraised\". She said that her husband did not regard the work as \"historical research, or scientific research\"* This particular claim was admittedly made under somewhat suspicious circumstances, but it does aptly describe the Gulag Archipelago. Not only are its anecdotes unverifiable, but the interspersed *facts* (using the term lightly) Solzhenitsyn gives about the gulag is absolutely ridiculous. he claims that [60 million people](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/04/books/04solzhenitsyn.html) (eg. 1/3 of the population). At the average gulag mortality rate of [5.34%](http://www.demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema06.php) that means that assuming equal distribution of gulag inmates from the 1930-1953 period, 3.5 million people would have died in the gulag. The truth is that less then [1/3](http://sovietinfo.tripod.com/GTY-Penal_System.pdf) of this many people died. Compared with other prison systems of the day and age, it is less then exceptional. Interestingly, the post-war gulag system, with an average mortality rate of [0.725%](http://www.demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema06.php) is somewhat comparable to the **modern** Russian prison system that has a mortality rate of [0.56%](https://inmoscowsshadows.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/russian-prisons-getting-more-lethal/),Even given nearly 70 years of medical advancements, the difference in mortality between post-war Soviet Gulags and modern Russian prisons is only 0.165%. The american prison mortality rate of [0.225%](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/msp0114st.pdf) isn't all that much lower, and despite being the richest nation on earth and having 68 years of medical and technological development, there is only a 0.5% difference between it and the so-called *most gruesome prison system in history*.\n\n3: \n\u201cThe Great Terror: Stalin\u2019s Purge of the thirties\u201d-Conquest\nI don\u2019t think I need to explain why this one is bunk to this audience, but never the less one part of the summary stands out: *When Soviet archives were opened following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and many of Conquest's claims were validated, Kingsley Amis joked that the book should be re-titled \"I Told You So, You Fucking Fools\". A revised edition titled \"The Great Terror: A Reassessment\" was printed in 1990.* A quick note about this: the revised edition came out in 1990 (read: one year before the dissolution of the USSR) and just about all of the claims made by Conquest in both his original book and the revised edition turned out to be at best heavily inflated and at worst totally false. A good example of this is his death toll of Holodomor, the supposedly man-made famine that ravaged the USSR in 1932-1933. He puts the death toll of the famine at *\u201cat least 7 million\u201d* however, released archives show a death toll of 2.4 million, and this claim is substantiated by a demographics analysis done in 2010 (Snider, 2010), but it has been discounted because, and I quote Timothy Snider \u201cit too closely matches the official soviet figures\u201d **Gee, I wonder why**. These archives were also considered state secrets throughout the USSR\u2019s existence, making it highly unlikely that they, along with other data from the time period, were tampered with or falsely recorded.\n\n\n4:\nOrigins of the Great Purge By J. Arch Getty (a book the author of this list clearly didn\u2019t read, considering they said the book claims over a million people were killed in the great purge (spoiler: it says fewer than 700,000) This one really belongs more in our masterpost, as it disproves much of the other work presented\n\n\n5:\nSoviet Psychiatric Abuse: A shadow over world psychiatry\nA book about the use of psychiatry as a \u201ctool for political repression in the USSR under Brezhnev\u201d (less than 125 people were \u201crepressed\u201d using psychiatry from 1960 to the collapse of the soviet union(Buyanov, 1993)) Il quote Russian Psychiatrist Mikhail Buyanov *\u201damong the persons were many fanatical nationalists, religious sectarians, and political paranoiacs who after escaping to freedom corrupted the masses, \u0441rammed their heads with nonsense, carried away immature people with their ideas through the connivance of the so-called progressive intelligentsia, and a result of it is wars, blood, and reciprocal hatred\u201d*\n\n\n6:\nBehind the Urals \u2013 John Scott\t\nThis one is interesting, because they have attempted to turn a pro-soviet book on its head, and in the process failed miserably. Every country undergoing industrialization has had some period in which living standards have been quite poor for the working class([some photos](https://world-civ-2012-13.wikispaces.com/file/view/clothersfactory.gif/388913496/379x270/clothersfactory.gif)]. In the west, this period served to enhance the profit-margin or capitalists, but in the Soviet Union it served a different purpose. The Soviet Union had found itself surrounded by enemies, and it felt the pressing need to industrialize in order to better compete with its rivals and raise living standards for the population. The Russian empire in 1913 had approximately 3.5-4.5 million industrial workers in a country of approximately 190 million people[source](https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/labour_russian_empire), and around 85 percent of the population lived in [rural areas](http://web.williams.edu/Economics/wp/nafzigerMicroLivingStandards_WilliamsWorkingPaper_Nov2007.pdf). Over the course of the first five-year plan, despite the massive gains in productivity, living standards remained fairly stagnant, as the primary focus was on heavy industry. However, by the late 1940s  [living standards had improved](https://web.williams.edu/Economics/brainerd/papers/ussr_july08.pdf), and goods were no longer being [rationed](http://web.williams.edu/Economics/wp/nafzigerMicroLivingStandards_WilliamsWorkingPaper_Nov2007.pdf). The struggle of the 1930s was comparable to the struggle of British industrial workers from the 1750s to the outbreak of world war two, the only difference being that the soviet struggle lasted a decade (more if you include world war two and its aftermath) and the British struggle lasted two centuries. Not only this, but workers were enthusiastic about their work (as the book shows), and had quite a few elements of self-management.\n\n\n7:\nThe Lysenko affair \u2013 David Joravsky\nThe Lysenko incident for those unfamiliar was the official promotion of Lysenkoism, an agricultural pseudoscience promoting something similar to Lamarckian inheritance. The Lysenko affair is admittedly a stain on soviet science, but in the context of the Soviet Union in the 1930\u2019s and 40\u2019s, it made (slightly) more sense. As you all well know, the 1930s brought on an industrial advancement in the Soviet Union that has never before or since been rivaled. In four years, industrial production doubled and agricultural production skyrocketed with collectivization[source](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1933/01/07.htm). Particularly in agriculture, the Soviet authorities were looking to increase agricultural productivity. They made a decision to support Lysenko in his theories of rejecting conventional genetics, and made use of techniques like deep plowing. And they \nseemed to work. During the 1930s the USSR saw a huge uptick in agricultural productivity, but it was only a few decades later that it was realized it was not because of Lysenkoism, but in spite of it. Around the same time Lysenko\u2019s ideas began to be put into practice, collectivization and the mechanization of agriculture took place, which is what triggered the spike in yields. Lysenko continued to insist that his ideas were a factor in rising agricultural productivity, and often attacked geneticists for not contributing to soviet agriculture. It did not help that he was an extremely shrewd statesman and knew how to navigate soviet politics. From a scientific perspective, we must remember that this was over 20 years before the discovery of DNA, and the soviet leadership was rather preoccupied with achieving what effectively amounted to one hundred years of industrial progress in less than 5 years. It is also implied that the soviet leadership was inflexible in their attitudes towards science, but this is not the case. Arnold Chikobava, a soviet linguist once wrote a letter to Stalin to inform him that the prevailing linguistic theory in the Soviet Union at the time, dubbed Marxist Linguistics was incorrect, and that he believed that the he should reconsider his policy. Stalin invited Arnold to a dinner that lasted from 9PM to 7AM in which Arnold explained the basics of linguistics and presented his evidence(Montefiore, 2003). Stalin then summoned the Politburo to debate the matter and announced that he had changed his mind on the subject. Considering nationalities (of which linguistics plays a major role) was one of his most notable specialties academically, to change his mind on a topic so radically important to his work demonstrates that he was much more open-minded than most think, and thus it is unlikely that there was widespread knowledge that Lysenkoism was bunk. In conclusion, lysenkoism was a mistake, but it was not one that was well known to the leadership at the time\n\n\n8:\nEinstein and Soviet Ideology - Alexander Vucinich\nThis criticism of the Soviet Union is vastly undercut by one crucial fact: there was never suppression of physics-related research in the Soviet Union. Soviet institutes questioned general relativity on some occasions, and some individual scientists promoted a statistical interpretation of general relativity, but never was research into physics suppressed. \u201cContemporary cases of the rejection of mainstream physics research by Marxists still exist\u201d\nIn short, no they don\u2019t. They simply define the contradiction as the appearance of the phenomenon and the reality of the phenomenon.\n\n\n9:\nThe Ghost of the Executed Engineer -Loren Graham:\nThroughout my wading through this list, I have become more and more convinced that the makers of it didn\u2019t read the books they are recommending, or at the very least did a very poor job at understanding them. The Ghost of the Executed engineer is a fictionalized account of the life of engineer Peter Palchinsky that uses him as a plot device to criticize soviet industrialization. I don\u2019t know the specifics of Palchinsky\u2019s life or the trial that led up to his death, so I will refrain from commenting, but the experiences of one man are in no way representative of the 170 million people living in the Soviet Union during the historical setting of this book. Another interesting point is that the timeframe in which Palchinsky\u2019s story takes place was during the late NEP era, therefore I would be cautious about using it to represent the entire soviet economy\n\n\n10:\nAnimal Farm- George Orwell\nThis is obviously a fiction book, as you well know, but I felt that it deserves a special category of its own, as it is so often mentioned by anti-communists as a brilliant work. There are a whole host of problems associated with using fiction novels in political discourse, but the one I will be touching on in this piece is simply the fact that Orwell was talking out of his ass, for lack of a better term. Orwell never once set foot in the USSR, nor did he ever do any in-depth research as to what life was really like in the Soviet Union.  A self-proclaimed democratic socialist, later in life he even betrayed his fellow \u201ccomrades\u201d and wrote a list of potential communists to [MI5] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orwell%27s_list) . The book was nothing more than an anti-Soviet polemic designed to sell copies in the west and annoy communists in the east. Furthermore, many of the allegories in the book are simply under/overrepresentations of the soviet system. A good example is the construction of the wind mill, which is supposed to represent soviet industrialization. A more accurate picture would be if they built 5 windmills, doubled the farm yield and moved the animals from barns to apartments (a quick note, the previous statement was just to make a point, pay no attention to specific numbers.) Furthermore, the representation of soviet \u201ctotalitarianism\u201d is vastly overblown (see-origins of the great purge by J-Arch Getty and Another view on Stalin by Ludo Martens). In conclusion, Animal farm deserves no more a place in serious discussions about communism than American Sniper belongs in discussion about capitalism.\n\n\n11:\nThe Killing Wind-  Tan Hecheng\nThis book details the Daoxian massacre, a massacre by red guard groups during the cultural revolution. There is no doubt that this massacre was unfortunate, but the actions of individual red guard groups acting on their own accords can hardly be blamed on chairman Mao or even Mao in general. I would also recommend checking out the PRC section in the debunking anti-communism masterpost found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/11yp4f/opinions_on_defense_of_stalin_and_mao/c6qobhh/)\n\n\n12:\nDebunking Marxism-101:\nI will admit, it is somewhat impressive that someone took the time to compile a document like this. However, it appears to be based on flawed assumptions and neoliberal analysis. After some searching I found a video by TheFinnishBolshevik that tackles this very analysis here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7oT-SIjXoI&amp;ab_channel=TheFinnishBolshevik)\n\n\n13:\nThe revolution will not be adequately sourced\nThis one attempts to debunk the Debunking anti-communism masterpost. This one has already been covered by Kyle Joseph [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/3lot78/bad_history_indeed_in_defense_of_the/)\n\n\nIn Conclusion:\nI think most reading this have already come to this conclusion, but the \"resources for anti-communists\" is not a valuable pool of resources, but rather a collection of misinterpreted and flawed documents, mixed in with some that don't belong in the first place and the requisite *wasn't real communism* strawman. Rightists, you have really outdone yourselves\n\n","subreddit":"communism","title":"Debunking the \"Resources for Anti Communists\""}
