Working people should not be in debt or barely able to survive and afford food and housing.  I'm trying to finish my undergraduate at a public university and it is so expensive... Even if I worked full time and everything I made went to tuition, I wouldn't make enough in a year to cover the cost of classes.  My family makes good money and I am grateful that they are helping me finish school, but I feel guilty that it costs so much.  I also feel nauseous from the constant consumer culture and messages from everywhere to buy more stuff.  People are working so hard, yet no one seems happy.\n\nThere were some posts recently in r\/socialism about the true cause of violent crime being the fact that capitalism (and, in general, unfair competition for resources) pushes people to the margins of society and makes people feel lonely and isolated.  I agree, and would even argue that the culture of bullying in schools is an extension of the same culture of competition.  I don't think humans innately think to act that way to each other, we're trained to.\n\nSorry for rambling, comrades.  Thanks to anyone who read all of it.

And that we know, the CIA planned coups and assasination attempts.  \n\nAnd I don't even care that much about the attempts of coups on venezuela at this point, the assasination of these people.\n\nAnd then if you go and see, I had read of this, there are a lot of lefty politic leadrs or govt officials in south america at least who suddenly contracted cancer.  \nLike, castro and chavez died from cancer, but then cristina also had cancer, both lula and dilma got cancer, evo morales got cancer also, fernando lugo from paraguay too...  \nI thought there were more though, but i don't remember where I read it, so assume not, that there aren't more presidents with cancer.  \nAlso, nestor kirchner died too, but it wasn't from cancer. Then his wife also got cancer.   \nI got the list of presidents above from, through first googling, here: http:\/\/www.pravdareport.com\/world\/americas\/05-01-2012\/120158-south_america-0\/\n\nI've got to say, i thought maduro had cancer too and am glad that he doesn't have... I still don't let the cia off the accusation for the other presidents. Plus, the assasination attempts from the cia are still there.\n\nAlso, what he mentions in that video (the debunking john oliver one), about the palestinian politician who was confirmed poisoned \"with cancer\" (it was with radioactive material, plutonium), was a thing made by mossad, and I think that was to say that \"cancer giving weapons\" exist.\n\nA capitalist wanting to justify, could say that the cancer thing is not proved, but... Couldn't say that castro and chavez aren't democratic, because they are.\n\nAnd those are recent examples, then you go to when they killed Allende (socialist president in Chile) and wtv.\n\nSo they have proved assasination attempts, and are still secret.  \nThey are, probable cancer assasins, and confirmed assasination attempters (to chavez and castro).\n\nOh, and what I meant by secret until now was actually non democratic (if it's secret even to the congress, the congress, and also the people indirectly, can't vote on it),  \nbut also by them being secret you have the problem that you can't even stop them when they come.\n\nWell and after that: The CIA gets a lot of funds:  \n(from the link here: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/worldnews\/comments\/8inc8y\/trump_administration_cancels_nasa_plan_to_track\/dytayre\/)  \n\"  \n3. The Black Budget: Reading the defense appropriations bill, you will come across many line items simply labeled \u201cclassified,\u201d or have designations that are vague at best. Much of what the Pentagon does is secret for security reasons, but the scale of this spending is huge. The proposed budget allocates $58.7 billion dollars for classified programs, ranging from Special Forces operations to a rumored new bomber.  \n\nSecret weapons systems and covert operations are nothing new for the military. But this number accounts for more than 10% of the baseline budget, and is by definition not subject to public scrutiny.  \n\"\n\nAnd then, as if it mattered, but, you know that supposedly they release documents after a certain time, 40 years or wtv, well recently you could read that they censor all of them too, so you can't even read them after that, and can't make them accountable. It matters but less than they not doing the actual thing.  \nSee here: https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/opendirectories\/comments\/898eup\/tb_of_data\/dwpp1pq\/\n\nSo:  \nI don't know which benefit you are getting from having this secret, undemocratic, known for murder of opponents acts, and on top of it conservative, organization, but...  \nI don't know which are the benefits of that, but see the costs of having that undemocratic secret thing, and i doubt the benefits are worth it.\n\nAnd, i don't know if we have that idea of the cia, as the non democratic murderous organization with a lot of budget, so i made the post.\n","subreddit":"communism","title":"Rant on the CIA - are we aware on the opinion of \"it's and undemocratic secret organization\"?"}

How do we get the proletariat in the US to stop supporting the Democrats and Republicans. Most American  proletariats support the Democrats (especially Blacks and Hispanics), due to their false claims to support the working class (in reality their just as Pro-Corporate as the Republicans). However, a minority of them support the Republicans, due to their use of cultural \u201cwedge issues\u201d like Abortion, Gay marriage, and Gun Control to keep poor religious Whites in their party. And if you live in the US and have know partisan Democrats or Republicans, you\u2019ll know that they believe the propaganda of their party, hook, line, and sinker. This is primarily due to the fact the three main Cable News Networks are controlled by these two parties (Fox News is controlled by the Republicans, while CNN and MSNBC are controlled by the Democrats), and these networks don\u2019t let on anyone who disagrees with the acceptable \u201cLiberal\u201d or \u201cConservative\u201d ideology (Liberalism is basically Secular Capitalism, while Conservatism is basically religious Capitalism).

And realizes a lot of flaws within capitalism. He listened to Richard Wolff for a bit, and liked the idea of worker coops, but never really sat well with him.

I understand how the Cambodian people had to be evacuated from the cities back to the country side to reduce the possible threat of starvation, as the US bombing campaign had destroyed crops and forced farmers to leave the country side and flee to the cities (in turn depleting food production). How I understand things \u2013 and correct me if I am wrong - the Khmer Rouge were able to meet this goal, by defeating the US and forcing city dwellers and farmers (who fled to the cities) alike to move to the country side to start producing food again, therefore I am curious as to what the Khmer Rouge's plans were for Cambodia in the years following the invasion? Did they have some immediate plan for the following decade or so that was never realized? And if so what was it? Perhaps something akin to the Soviet and Eastern Bloc five-year plans or China's Great Leap Forward? Would they have started to allow city dwellers to return to the capital once again now that food was being produced. Or am I wrong and was the country still in need of producing more food, meaning those moved to the country side would continue to stay and produce food. Or is the factor of food production inconsequential in this matter. Would the Khmer Rouge have kept the people in the country side as part of their alleged long term plan to return Cambodia to its ancient agrarian years, pre-industrialization. And speaking of the Khmer Rouge's long term plan\u2026\n\nSecond Question:\n\nIs it true that the Khmer Rouge's long term goal for Cambodia was to transform the country into a purely rural, de-industrialized agrarian society like in ancient times? It seems like an unusual if not un-helpful objective for a communist party to strive for - that is unless the Khmer Rouge believed that such a time in Cambodia\u2019s history was a form of primitive communism: I've heard people say similar things about First Nations society in North America pre-colonization. If this is not true, what was their long term goal (if any), say for the decades up to the 2000's or even into the 21st century.\n\nThoughts? Any official Communist Party of Kampuchea materials (on the off chance they can be found or exist) answering these questions would be appreciated. But of course Id be interested to hear from Comrades here.\n\nA bit of a long question \u2013 I know. The topic of the Khmer Rouge and Democratic Kampuchea are of great interest to me from both a historical and political perspective (as a Maoist), and one that I spend much of my time reading about and researching. Thanks Comrades.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Khmer Rouge's Goals: Immediate and Long-term"}

Michael Parenti has a great lecture on this. \n\nThis sort of thing continues down every typical reactionary conspiracy theorist thread.

In other words; is it better to support capitalist nations that reject western imperialism? Or is there necessarily any time ever that western imperialism is right to intervene? My gut tells me that there is no intervention by imperialist powers ( the united states, europe) that would put into place ANY anti imperialist power, a left wing anti capitalist dictatorship but always just another puppet neo colonial capitalist dictatorship that perpetuates, permits, and endorses western hegemonic domination.  Any comrades on here think differently? Politically, i am convinced it is right to support obviously developing socialist states but also to support at least anti imperialist developing capitalist states in the face of western hegemony.\n\nI feel like this sounds almost heretical.

They just sent this note to supporters:\n\n\n\nComrades, \n    \nMany of you already know about the current situation we are in and its causes. For those who don\u2019t or have been wonder where we\u2019ve been, we hope to explain the turn of events that led to this situation, what our direction is for the future and offer our sincerest apologies. The problem has been exacerbated by being unable to access our email or Facebook page to notify our friends and followers, but we hope to reach out by asking our supporters to circulate this letter.\n\nPravda Media has been essentially non-operational for the past four months because of financial issues which arose after our main bank account was frozen pending an overtly political investigation into our identities, finances and the nature of our project due to material sold which defended and advocated for enemies of U.S. imperialism under sanction. By the time the bank investigation was complete, we were behind on a large number of orders and owed back payments on business services utilized by Pravda such as email service, marketing, etc.  At this point we had disabled our checkout system as to not add to the amount of backorders already accumulated and worsen the financial situation. On top of all of this we recently discovered that our project is in even more jeopardy because of the threat of lawsuit due to our default on a business loan used to buy a small amount of inventory after the account freeze-- having not expected the amount of damage the investigation would do to our operation.  These are the most pertinent facts. Where are we going from here?\n\nCurrently, we are working on launching a fundraiser and temporary store via Spreadshirt (shop.spreadshirt.com\/revolutionary-apparel )  to sell some of our popular apparel and merchandise designs. Side by side, we hope the store and fundraising campaign will help to raise the money needed to relaunch and fulfill backorders or provide refunds to those that prefer them. We are also working to regain access to our email and Facebook page, but in the meantime we have created a temporary email address \u2014 pravdamedia.orders@gmail.com \u2014 so customers with backorders or questions can contact us. We have every intention of fulfilling all orders in the most timely manner possible, however send us an email with any concerns and we will do our best to ensure your satisfaction. We sincerely apologize to all our customers and supporters, and we thank you profusely for your patience.\n\nWe still see a large demand for our products and hundreds of people visit our website daily. Friends and supporters have urged us to fight to continue our mission and because of this we will do so. Below is a list of goals we must achieve for our project to continue. \n \nGOALS\n\n* Raise the amount of $5,000 through fundraising and selling shirts in two months. We hope to sell 400 shirts in order to raise at least half the amount needed.\n* Fulfill all orders, provide all refunds requested, pay off all bills to services rendered as the money is raised.\n* Prevent lawsuit mentioned above by paying off the balance of $2000 in a lump sum.\n* Once we have completed these steps we will be out of the negative. At this point we will fully relaunch Pravda Media, close the Spreadshirt store and begin selling our literature\/merch via www.pravda-m.com again. \n* Begin refocusing on our literature\/educational material rather than merchandise, eliminate preordering, and move completely to the print on demand method which will be most time efficient.\n* In five months our goal is to be launching 2-4 new books per month, expanding our catalog of Marxist-Leninist and other revolutionary literature. \n\nThis may seem like an uphill battle, but we believe together with our supporters we will achieve it. We urge all our supporters and friends to circulate this letter as widely as possible, as well as to purchase some apparel from our Spreadshirt store (we make about $5 per shirt on average) or send a donation to support our cause. If you wish to donate, you can do so via www.paypal.me\/pravda.media. Pravda Media will not another project be defeated by political repression; together we will win, and we must win. We cannot wait to begin sending Leninist literature to comrades around the world again.\n\nLong live Marxism Leninism!\n\nLong live international socialism!\n\nLong live the Revolution!\n\n\n \nSincerest apologies and solidarity as always,\n\nPravda Media Team","subreddit":"communism","title":"Pravda Media Rebuilding After Political Repression"}
