I read this article by Scott Thomas that basically explains why I favor communism to core capitalism any day.  Here is a portion of his article that belongs to him. \n\n\u201cSometimes anti-Autistic propaganda is set forth by groups that purport to assist people. For example, the charity Autism Speaks promotes the Tragedy Model of Autism, which is the idea that a diagnosis of autism means certain, unbearable, financial and emotional hardship for the family of the Autistic. A promotional video called \"Autism Every Day\" includes former executive vice president of Autism Speaks, Alison Tepper Singer, voicing her fantasy to drive her daughter and herself off of the George Washington Bridge.\nThe organization stated that non-Autistic parents of Autistics should embrace these types of feelings rather than flee from them or seek help for them. This propaganda creates an attitude of dehumanization; the message is that we are so devastating to abled peoples' lives that we should be eradicated via whatever means necessary (whether by cure or another method), and that our lives are so miserable they must not be worth living. Sometimes, tragically, this occurs, like the 2006 case of Katie McCarron, a three-year-old Autistic girl in Illinois whose mother was convicted of first-degree murder for suffocating her. People who kill Autistic and other people with disabilities are more likely to be acquitted by sympathetic juries or more lightly sentenced by judges than those who murder non-disabled people. (thiswayoflife.org)\n \nSocialism, disabilities and the 99%\n \nThe dehumanization of Autistics and people with other disabilities stems from a fundamental element of the capitalist system. Under capitalism, all things that exist are valued according to their ability to generate profit for the 1%. Even the 99%, who have nothing to sell but their labor, are given value according to their ability to produce profit for the 1%, who make money purely via their ownership of the means of production.\n \nBecause of this, those in the 99% are valued according to their ability to work within the profit-producing machine that the 1% engineered. Therefore, the 1% want to give us as little as possible; they attack us with institutionalization, poor education and austerity measures. Because of this devaluation, people with disabilities have been neglected, abused and killed since the dawn of class society.\n \nDespite the many transgressions which capitalist society has carried out against Autistics and other people with disabilities, there is still hope for the future. In Cuba, a country where the 99% rose up and drove out the 1%, people with disabilities are viewed, first and foremost, as people who have something to contribute to society, rather than a burden.\nRather than cut away at education, health care and benefits, as is happening in the U.S. and other capitalist countries, Cuban society provides excellent education free through the university level, free health care, and jobs or income for all.\n \nCuban schools use a diverse set of educational approaches geared toward helping Autistic children become educated and happy citizens capable of making a contribution to socialist society, rather than being trained to become cogs in the profit machine as in the U.S. People with disabilities who are unable to do the work that most Cubans do are given jobs reading to other workers so that the workers are better able to enjoy the time spent at work. These jobs provide people with disabilities both the income to support themselves and the satisfaction that comes with knowing that one is valuable to society.\n \nCapitalism offers only dehumanization, destitution and even death to people with disabilities. Only by smashing the 1% can people with disabilities have the full freedom to live the most fulfilling lives possible, unhindered by the misdeeds of a system that seeks to destroy us.\u201d \n\nAnd I am new here and I hope to make allies. \n \n","subreddit":"communism","title":"I have Aspergers and This is why I support Marxist Communism."}

In response, our Party's Lawyers objected to the Magistrates' Court and stated that this period of detention was against the law. These objections have also been rejected.\n\nSo far, our party has been fighting against the AKP government both in the legal field and in its actions.

I read this article by Scott Thomas that basically explains why I favor communism to core capitalism any day.  Here is a portion of his article that belongs to him. \n\n\u201cSometimes anti-Autistic propaganda is set forth by groups that purport to assist people. For example, the charity Autism Speaks promotes the Tragedy Model of Autism, which is the idea that a diagnosis of autism means certain, unbearable, financial and emotional hardship for the family of the Autistic. A promotional video called \"Autism Every Day\" includes former executive vice president of Autism Speaks, Alison Tepper Singer, voicing her fantasy to drive her daughter and herself off of the George Washington Bridge.\nThe organization stated that non-Autistic parents of Autistics should embrace these types of feelings rather than flee from them or seek help for them. This propaganda creates an attitude of dehumanization; the message is that we are so devastating to abled peoples' lives that we should be eradicated via whatever means necessary (whether by cure or another method), and that our lives are so miserable they must not be worth living. Sometimes, tragically, this occurs, like the 2006 case of Katie McCarron, a three-year-old Autistic girl in Illinois whose mother was convicted of first-degree murder for suffocating her. People who kill Autistic and other people with disabilities are more likely to be acquitted by sympathetic juries or more lightly sentenced by judges than those who murder non-disabled people. (thiswayoflife.org)\n \nSocialism, disabilities and the 99%\n \nThe dehumanization of Autistics and people with other disabilities stems from a fundamental element of the capitalist system. Under capitalism, all things that exist are valued according to their ability to generate profit for the 1%. Even the 99%, who have nothing to sell but their labor, are given value according to their ability to produce profit for the 1%, who make money purely via their ownership of the means of production.\n \nBecause of this, those in the 99% are valued according to their ability to work within the profit-producing machine that the 1% engineered. Therefore, the 1% want to give us as little as possible; they attack us with institutionalization, poor education and austerity measures. Because of this devaluation, people with disabilities have been neglected, abused and killed since the dawn of class society.\n \nDespite the many transgressions which capitalist society has carried out against Autistics and other people with disabilities, there is still hope for the future. In Cuba, a country where the 99% rose up and drove out the 1%, people with disabilities are viewed, first and foremost, as people who have something to contribute to society, rather than a burden.\nRather than cut away at education, health care and benefits, as is happening in the U.S. and other capitalist countries, Cuban society provides excellent education free through the university level, free health care, and jobs or income for all.\n \nCuban schools use a diverse set of educational approaches geared toward helping Autistic children become educated and happy citizens capable of making a contribution to socialist society, rather than being trained to become cogs in the profit machine as in the U.S. People with disabilities who are unable to do the work that most Cubans do are given jobs reading to other workers so that the workers are better able to enjoy the time spent at work. These jobs provide people with disabilities both the income to support themselves and the satisfaction that comes with knowing that one is valuable to society.\n \nCapitalism offers only dehumanization, destitution and even death to people with disabilities. Only by smashing the 1% can people with disabilities have the full freedom to live the most fulfilling lives possible, unhindered by the misdeeds of a system that seeks to destroy us.\u201d \n\nAnd I am new here and I hope to make allies. \n \n","subreddit":"communism","title":"I have Aspergers and This is why I support Marxist Communism.""num_comments":1,"score":6,"selftext":"","subreddit":"SocialismAndVeganism","title":"I have Aspergers and This is why I support Marxist Communism."}

On one hand, China is still a Communist state, with the Communist Party in full control of the country, which would logically indicate that China is the country Communist should be more supportive of. However, China has developed a cozy relationship with the United States, and has allowed American companies (especially tech companies like Apple) operate large factories in China, using cheap labor to manufacture goods to be enjoyed by the Bourgeoisie class of America and Western Europe.\nOn the other hand, Russia is no longer a Communist state, and its Communist party is a joke controlled by the ruling Right-wing party (United Russia), this would logically mean that it would be hypocritical for Communists to support Russia. However, unlike China, Russia has been consistently opposed to America\u2019s imperialist Foreign Policy, providing critical support to the Anti-imperialist Syrian Governmant against US-backed jihadist rebels, and Russia has stood by the Anti-imperialist Iranian government against the Imperialist American and Zionist Isreali efforts to promote regime change their. On top of this, Russia\u2019s military is much stronger then China\u2019s (their Nuclear triad is a even match for the US, while their Conventional forces are a close second), and unlike China, Russia dosent have significant trade with the United States, and definitely dosent have a large segment of its population slaving in American-owned factories. Taking all these contradictory factors into consideration, which country do you believe should receive more support from the international Communist Movement?","subreddit":"communism","title":"Which country should Marxist-Leninist be more supportive of, Russia or China?"}

{"author":"okmann98","created_utc":1526031086,"num_comments":4,"score":13,"selftext":"If I am understanding Marx in \"Critique of the Gotha Program\", Marx argues that there can be no such law because, should it actually be a law then it should be applicable to all relations of production:\n\n&gt;It is well known that nothing of the \"iron law of wages\" is Lassalle's except the word \"iron\" borrowed from Goethe's \"great, eternal iron laws\". The word \"iron\" is a label by which the true believers recognize one another. But if I take the law with Lassalle's stamp on it, and consequently in his sense, then I must also take it with his substantiation for it. And what is that? As Lange already showed, shortly after Lassalle's death, it is the Malthusian theory of population (preached by Lange himself). But if this theory is correct, then again I cannot abolish the law even if I abolish wage labor a hundred times over, because the law then governs not only the system of wage labor but every social system. [Source](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch02.htm)\n\nBut why does the word \"law\" necessarily mean that Lasalle believes that this 'iron law' is applicable to all relations of production? Surely there's a possibility that Lasalle exclusively referred to it as an economic law under the relations of production of his time, no?\n\nFurthermore, if I observe the current first world economies, it seems (at least to a layman like myself) to me that the current period of globalization, which has been IMO accurately described as one that \"generates wealthy nations with poor populations), is more alligned with Lasalle's law than with what Marx describes in chapter 25 of Capital Vol. I. Chapter 25 states the following:\n\n&gt;The correlation between accumulation of capital and rate of wages is nothing else than the correlation between the unpaid labour transformed into capital, and the additional paid labour necessary for the setting in motion of this additional capital. It is therefore in no way a relation between two magnitudes, independent one of the other: on the one hand, the magnitude of the capital; on the other, the number of the labouring population; it is rather, at bottom, only the relation between the unpaid and the paid labour of the same labouring population. If the quantity of unpaid labour supplied by the working class, and accumulated by the capitalist class, increases so rapidly that its conversion into capital requires an extraordinary addition of paid labour, then wages rise, and, all other circumstances remaining equal, the unpaid labour diminishes in proportion. But as soon as this diminution touches the point at which the surplus labour that nourishes capital is no longer supplied in normal quantity, a reaction sets in: a smaller part of revenue is capitalised, accumulation lags, and the movement of rise in wages receives a check. The rise of wages therefore is confined within limits that not only leave intact the foundations of the capitalistic system, but also secure its reproduction on a progressive scale. [Source](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm)  \n\nThis passage seems to me to conclude that higher levels of capital accumulation will result in a lower unpaid/paid labor ratio until a point where the surplus labor extracted from the workers is no longer enough to nourish the further accumulation of capital, and thus \"the movement in the rise of wages receives a check\". However I look at stats that show how [productivity has skyrocketed yet unpaid labor has remained relatively stagnant](https://www.epi.org/productivity-pay-gap/), which are such a staple of globalist neoliberalism and it seems that it alligns more with Lavalle in that workers are just paid enough shit to survive for as long as the capitalist class can continuously get away with doing so.\n\nAm I just inept? Is the fact that it's 6AM and I haven't gone to bed yet affecting my understanding? I don't see why Marx would speak on varying ratios of something as systemic as worker exploitation, when Lassalle's version seems a lot more fitting to the current reality.","subreddit":"communism","title":"How exactly is the Lasallean Iron Law of Wages disproven by Marx and is it antithetical to scientific socialism?"}

That is the question that is pulsing through the country, especially as the nation embarks on the dark road to war.\n\nA plethora of pro-imperialist writers (pro-imperialists can be of both the right or the so-called \u2018left\u2019) have been busy promoting the suggestion that many of those who are firmly in the anti-war camp (such as this writer) are somehow \u2018Anti-American.\u2019 Of course, they feel no need to define their terms, for they rely on the implicit understanding of the reader to follow their drift.\n\nBut such a charge has a long history in the United States, and seriously deserves an answer.\n\nDecades ago, the U.S. Congress appropriated to itself the task of defining what \u2018Anti-Americanism\u2019 meant, and established the infamous HUAC (for the House on Un-American Activities Committee). This group waged ideological war on Communists, socialists, and anyone who tried to organize social change in the repressive status quo of the United States. People barely remember the rednecks who sat on the side of the government, and who imperiously condemned those who came before them, but Paul Robeson, Dr. W.E. B. DuBois, and the Hollywood 10 (actors and writers who were black listed during the period) are remembered with something akin to reverence.\n\nWho were the \u2018real Americans\u2019? The rednecks and racists who stormed and raged and lorded it over those activists and artists? I stand with Robeson. I stand with DuBois. I would rather pitch my tent with the artists of the Hollywood Ten, who stood for the right to create work that reflected the truths about this society, rather than with the racists and segregationist politicians who stood for silence in the face of repression.\n\nThousands of people lost their livelihoods, and some committed suicide in the face of this cruel government repression. Families were destroyed in this witch hunt of the 1950\u2019s which launched the careers of the Nixons, and the Roy Coens, and the like.\n\nThe definition of American has been contested all throughout the history of this country, and when the State has been able to assert their meaning, it has always meant blind obedience to those in power, in government.\n\nThere are millions of people in this country who believe in another definition. They believe in the people. They believe that it is not the duty of people to obey the government, but the duty of the government to obey the people. They believe that everyone should have a say in that definition, not just the moneyed interests. They also do not believe in Empire.\n\nTo be an American also means that one is related to other peoples in the Americas. Like the Cubans. Like the Venezuelans. Like the Nicaraguans. Like the Brazilians.\n\nThey do not believe that it is the inherent right, or the \u2018manifest destiny\u2019 of the Norte Americanos to rule over them like New Rome.\n\nThey don\u2019t believe that it is right for American military or CIA or any other agency to destroy the leaders or popular organizations of neighboring states (or distant ones).\n\nThat definition of American is not anti-American, but the very best of what it means to be a part of the people of the Americas.\n\nThat kind of American is not represented in the halls of government or in the corridors of power in the Bush regime; but it is in the hearts, minds, and souls of the people. It has not yet found true political expression, but it will.\n\nThey may be called anti-imperialists.

Looking at the wildly important (strategically speaking) Middle East today, we are seeing today the formation of a socialist aligned, anti-imperialist \"Axis of Resistance,\" led by Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and non-state resistance groups such as Hezbollah and anti-ISIS militias. These forces have been fighting in order to bring some semblance of independence and regional integration to the long oppressed masses of the Middle East, an alternative framework for development than the capitalist program imposed upon them by Western powers. The West, of course has noticed these promising developments and mounted a powerful counterattack, uniting Israel and the reactionary Islamic Gulf Arab states together. Led by Trump, Netanyahu, and Muhammad bin Salman, this alliance seeks to destroy independent socialist and anti-imperialist movements in the Arab world and subjugate them to the fate suffered by the Iraqis, Afghans, and Vietnamese. This is the scientific understanding of the region that any proponent of the Marxist tradition must uphold.\n\n**Now, my question, if you will:** Given this dialectically escalating sitution, I have one simple question: **how can I help?** How can I do something besides simply standing solidarity with the legitimate governments of Dr. Bashar al-Assad and the Iranian Republic, against barbarism? How can I combat the forces of U.S.-backed Islamofascist savagery in Syria with more than just words online? I am a White American, from an upper-middle class background. I enjoy the privilege to do things like start college next year and have enough money to have fun every now and then. Basically, what I'm saying is that most of us, as Westerners from a previleged background, have access to certain comforts and resources - and that it would be sinful (from a secular Marxist point of view) to not use this position to help others. Therefore, I'm wondering if there are any political parties in the United States that uphold a correct Marxist-Leninist  line with regard to imperialism. Are there any that have made contacts with figures in anti-imperialist politics abroad, that I may join?

This can clearly be seen in the US Democratic Party and UK Labour Party which shortly after the Soviet Union fell embraced the \u201cNew Democrat\u201d and \u201cNew Labour\u201d mantra of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair which moved those parties from Center-Left to Center-Right on economics, causing them to fully embrace Neoliberal policies of Deregulation, Free Trade, Gutting Saftey Nets, and Cutting Taxes. Many blame this on the collapse of Labor unions in those countries and the Taboo that was placed on Economic Leftism by the mainstream media in the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union. However, my gut tells me something else may have played a role. At the same time the Soviet Union was falling and the Unipolar \u201cNew World Order\u201d was being proclaimed by President George HW Bush, a New Sociological theory was sweeping Western Universities called \u201cIntersectionality\u201d, which proposed that Class struggle and Historical Materialism were not the only way Leftists should view the world, but that those ideas should be intertwined with Cultural issues like Women\u2019s rights, LGBT rights, and Racial equality. In turn, due to the Neoliberal atmosphere that has swept the World since 1991, these issues have displaced Class issues as the central cause of Western Leftists (especially in the United States), allowing Center-Left political Parties like the US Democrats and UK Labour to adopt Neoliberal policies as extreme as their Center-Right counterparts. This has been especially damaging to Marxism-Leninism because most of the Far-Left youth have been uninterested in Marxism-Leninism because they view it as \u201cDiscredited\u201d and \u201ctoo Class-focused\u201d, instead these young people have been more drawn to \u201cIntersectional-friendly\u201d ideologies like Anarchism and Social Democracy, which are more culturally libertarian and less Class-focused then Marxism-Leninism (Hence the reason DSA has seem a surge in membership in the US while the main Marxist-Leninist party here is the notoriously revisionist CPUSA). This is not to say that Cultural issues like Women\u2019s rights, LGBT rights, and Racial equality aren\u2019t important for a successful Marxist-Leninist movement, but it would be foolish for us not to admit that the recent fad of \u201cIntersectionality\u201d has distracted the Left from being able to successfully resist the extreme Neoliberalism that has swept the world since the fall of the Soviet Union. Finally, isn\u2019t it interesting that it was the same time the Soviet Union was collapsing and Neoliberalism was taking over the World that Intersectionality started becoming the main ideology of the Left (displacing Marxism-Leninism)?","subreddit":"communism","title":"Do you think Intersectionality has hurt Leftism (especially Marxism-Leninism)?"}

I wish to open a discussion about this topic.\n\nReligion is by definition an idealistic worldview: all religions state that reality is influenced, in part or completely, by ideal entities and causes. One may believe that an event occurred because of the intercession of a saint, or as a gift from a god, or as a revenge by a spirit.\n\nSuch a worldview is directly in contrast with Marxist analysis, which is rooted in dialectical and historical materialism. For us marxists, all reality is a dialectic evolution of *material* components, a product of *material* conditions, nothing can effect reality besides material entities. To admit the existence of ideal causes is a negation of a root Marxist principle and reflects in analyses that are inherently incorrect - the more they attribute to religion, the less correct they are. Furthermore, to deny that material conditions are the root of all reality means to diminish the fundamental role of humans in writing their history; it means to deny that the society is the sole responsible for the victory of the proletariat. Vice versa, adopting an orthodox Marxist worldview is in contrast with the foundations of religion, rendering deities useless - perhaps they exist, but they are unable to cause any material change.\n\nSome comments in the thread hinted that communism would win over more people if it presented itself as more friendly to religion. That is plain opportunism, going as far as compromising the founding principle of Marxist analysis for the sake of popularity. If anything, one may argue that militants could leave the religious question aside when agitating workers and approaching potential militants - after all, for many it is still a relief, an \"opiate\" - but for no reason shall we *deny* the incompatibility of religion.\n\nFinally, one comment mentioned the necessity for us to \"respect the people's beliefs\" and to let foreign peoples \"forge their own destiny\", and not \"force brown people to bend to Western thought\". That, too, is opportunism; we communists should know better than to support ideologies that do not benefit the working class by theorizing that the force for their liberation does not come entirely from the  society they live in.","subreddit":"communism","title":"On the compatibility of religion and communism"}

Some \\(if not, most\\) of them are aware that the corporations are making the bulk of their profits off of the third world \\(it depends how far down the supply chain they are, for example a reseller of used iPhones may not be aware that their profits indirectly come from the third world\\), however out of those who acknowledge that most of their profits come from the third world, none of them make the claim that corporations *are dependent* on the third world to make as much of their profits as they do \\(like how drug addicts will acknowledge that they use drugs a lot, but will say they could quit if they wanted to and claim they just don't want to\\). These economists can believe whatever they want and still do their job correctly, you really don't even have to have a degree in mainstream economics to do this job correctly, that's just a weeder test, like how a successful businessman doesn't need an MBA to run a large business.\n\nAlright now there's Macro\\-economics. Macro\\-economics is the economics of an entire nation, that's where Keynesian economics and Austrian economics and all that shit comes from. Here's the thing, due to capitalism being an economy run by private enterprises, these economists don't necessarily control the economy, rather they try to have the best relationship with corporations possible to bring the most amount of money and jobs into the national economy as possible, the macro\\-economists aren't necessarily concerned with *how* the corporations get those profits, however the macro\\-economists are concerned with how much taxes, tariffs, social programs and such and such are necessary to have a good national economy. For these economists their policies may work at home, however they could still be completely oblivious to how their policies are actually hurting the third world because it isn't on them to actually make the profits and get the money, it's on the private corporations. I think this is why when they try to implement the same policies in the third world it fails. Even on state\\-run international trade they may notice that they are able to obtain third world goods for cheap, however they are not concerned with why it is cheap however. Pretty much any school of economics can do this work, a Marxist economist hypothetically could do this work however I doubt they will just due to integrity. Even someone without a degree in economics can do this work, like a mathematician or something. So here a macro\\-economist can do their work and be successful at it in the imperialist core, however they can still be oblivious to how this effects the third world and blame the third world for not implementing recommended policy correctly.\n\nI remembering reading an economist claim that modernization theory is correct just by measure of empirical reality, I think that economist is shooting themselves in the foot with that argument because it's empirical reality proves that [most of the profits from the first world](https://weeklybolshevik.wordpress.com/2013/08/12/evidence-for-the-global-value-transfer/) [originate from the third world.](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jan/14/aid-in-reverse-how-poor-countries-develop-rich-countries) It's pretty hilarious how they claim to be legitimate high level science with high standards when modernization theory under international capitalism can only exist theoretically.\n\nLastly it's important to note that those who initiate imperialism are a very small group of people, they are executives of large corporations, and not even all the executives \\(e.g. Chief Technology Officer probably isn't masterminding imperialism\\). These are the people who go to foreign lands in order to utilize cheap labor, extract natural resources, or extract capital itself. These are also the people who initiate [false propaganda campaigns in the media,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZsdNigWYO4) [corrupt the science community](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/feb/21/climate-change-denier-willie-soon-funded-energy-industry) \\(e.g. Climate change denial\\) and [heavily influence politicians](https://represent.us/action/how-lobbyists-killed-net-neutrality/) [to the point that they would declare war for them.](https://history.libraries.wsu.edu/fall2014/2014/08/30/the-united-fruit-companys-effect-on-central-america-in-the-early-1900s/)\n\n&gt;The United Fruit Company continued to advertise throughout the mid twentieth century until they found a new use for their public relations skills.  A politician named Jacobo Arbenz was elected president in Guatemala, one of the Central American countries occupied by United Fruit \\(Gleijeses 453\\).  Arbenz was a strict nationalist, and all he wanted was for his people to stop suffering in poverty.  One of the most prominent issues in Guatemala, at the time, was scarcity of land.  When the United Fruit Company invaded Guatemala, they bought out many of the local farmers to acquire land for their plantations.  This did not leave room for the peasants, who relied on farming as the sole source of their income.  Arbenz created an agrarian reform that took land from the company and gave it back to the poor farmers that needed it \\(Gleijeses 453\\).  United Fruit was outraged by this reform.  They immediately launched a propaganda campaign led by Edward Bernays to convince the United States government and its people that Arbenz was a communist dictator \\(Streeter 64\\).  In a 1953 article by the New York Times, Guatemala was describes as \u201coperating under increasingly severe Communist\\-inspired pressure to rid the country of United States companies\u201d \\(Gruson 9\\).  United Fruit was manipulating the media to make it sound like the agrarian reform was only created because Arbenz was being influenced by the Soviet government to sabotage America\u2019s economic imperialism in Central America.  Since it was during the Cold War, association with communists was a serious accusation.  The United States\u2019 aggressive stance toward communism encouraged them to take immediate action.  The CIA hired civilian militias from Honduras to come into Guatemala and start a war against Arbenz and his followers.  United Fruit also convinced US President Eisenhower to threaten Arbenz because he and many other prominent American government officials had stock in United Fruit \\(Gleijeses 479\\).  With these pressures, Arbenz feared for his life and submitted his resignation.  However, this did not satisfy United Fruit.  They wished to make an example of Guatamala, so their other host nations wouldn\u2019t dare oppose them.  They had the CIA pay off the Guatemalan military so they would let the Honduras militia win \\(Streeter 63\\).  After the victory, the leader of the Honduras militia, Castillo Armas, was appointed as president of Guatemala and Armas was a puppet of the United Fruit Company for the rest of his term \\(Council on Hemispheric Affairs\\).\n\nThis goes to show that exploitation of the third world and first world dependency by the third world can slip under the noses of economists. The only main necessary imperialist actors are corporations, and their puppets are bourgeois governments \\(and media\\).\n\nThen there's micro\\-economics. This is pretty much cheer\\-leading capitalism and is used to justify the other two sectors of economics. Anyone can make up anything in this sector. Doesn't have much practicality.\n\nWhat do you guys think? I know this is possibly wrong but I have been trying to answer this question for the past couple days and this is the hypothesis that I could come up with. Of course this question doesn't necessarily need to be answered in order to prove that modern day economists are wrong, rather just an inquiry into how they can be wrong and appear to be correct.\n\nEdit: Adding important info","subreddit":"communism","title":"My hypothesis on how mainstream economists can be wrong and yet still do their job"}

We all know that the media cannot be trusted to be impartial and honest, so I decided to check out the reports written by respected human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch, the Human Rights Counsel of the UN &amp; Amnesty International. I will begin with [this report by the Human Rights Council of the United Nations.](https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G14/108/71/PDF/G1410871.pdf?OpenElement) Sixty\\-seven pages into the report, I discovered their standard of evidence for reports against the DPRK, here's what they had to say.\n\n&gt;67. Consistent  with  the  practice  of  other  United  Nations  fact\\-finding  bodies,  the  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Commission  employed  a  \u201creasonable  grounds\u201d  standard  of  proof  in  making  factual  \n&gt;  \n&gt;determinations  on  individual  cases,  incidents  and  patterns  of  state  conduct.  These  factual  \n&gt;  \n&gt;determinations  provided  the  basis  for  the  legal  qualification  of  incidents  and  patterns  of  \n&gt;  \n&gt;conduct as human rights violations and, where appropriate, crimes against humanity.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;68. There  are  \u201creasonable  grounds\u201d  establishing  that  an  incident  or  pattern  of  conduct  \n&gt;  \n&gt;has  occurred  when  the  Commission  is  satisfied  that  it  has  obtained  a  reliable  body  of  \n&gt;  \n&gt;information,  consistent  with  other  material,  based  on  which  a  reasonable  and  ordinarily  \n&gt;  \n&gt;prudent person has reason to believe that such incident or pattern of conduct has occurred.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This standard of proof is lower than the standard required in criminal proceedings to sustain  \n&gt;  \n&gt;an  indictment,  but  is  sufficiently  high  to  call  for  further  investigations  into  the  incident  or  \n&gt;  \n&gt;pattern  of  conduct  and,  where  available,  initiation  of  the  consideration  of  a  possible  \n&gt;  \n&gt;prosecution. The findings of the Commission appearing in this report must be understood as  \n&gt;  \n&gt;being based on the \u201creasonable grounds\u201d standard of proof, even when the full expression  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\(\u201creasonable grounds establishing\u201d\\) is not necessarily expressed throughout the text of this  \n&gt;  \n&gt;report.\n\nAs you can read there the UN admits that its standard of proof is not the equivalent standard of proof required in criminal proceedings in countries such as the United States, Europe and elsewhere. A few paragraphs later in the report the UN attempts to explain the DPRK's rights abuses by explaining it's history, seeing that acquiring evidence for the history of the Korean Peninsula is not immediately relevant to the report I'll skip it. Onward to the actual evidence.\n\nPublic hearing \\(testimony\\)\n\nPublic hearing \\(testimony\\)\n\nPrivate testimony\n\nPublic hearing \\(testimony\\)\n\nPublic hearing \\(testimony\\)\n\nSee source  2\n\nPrivate testimony\n\nPrivate testimony\n\nPublic hearing\n\nPublic hearing\n\nSee source 6\n\nI FOUND ONE\n\n&gt;1310  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Soviet Union verbatim \u201cRecord of a Conversation between Stalin, Kim Il Sung, Pak Heon\\-yeong,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Zhou Enlai, and Peng Dehuai\u201d, 4 September 1952, History and Public Policy Program Digital  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Archive, Translated into English from the original by Gary Goldberg. Available from:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[http://digitalarchive.wilsoncentre.org/document/114936](http://digitalarchive.wilsoncentre.org/document/114936).\n\nThat source proves that the DPRK held 30k\\+ prisoners of war during the Korean war, that information was gathered from a conversation between Stalin, Kim Il Sung &amp; Pak Heon\\-yeong. There is evidence that the DPRK kept these prisoners of war and have not released them yet, however considering the fact that the war isn't officially over yet \\(or just ended this month, unsure\\) it's understandable.Just as a quick note, this report uses media sources in their citation, so they're not really being objective at all. on citation 1397 they literally cite The Korea Times. They also cite the Encyclopedia Britannica \\(citation 19\\). And they cite books written by private authors.I did find some legitimate evidence though, photographic evidence. On page 294 there is a photo of a stamp, the back of the stamp is writings by a Korean who migrated from Japan to the DPRK shortly after the war. Here's the explanation of the evidence by the UN report.\n\n&gt;The  author  had  written  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cWe  cannot  leave  the  village.  Older  brother  do  not  come.  Mother  says she wishes to see you. Tell our sister in Toyama also not to come. What Bunto\u2019s father said is correct.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1425  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u2022 One  witness,  the  only  member  of  his  family  to  remain  in  Japan,  received  similar  messages  from  his  family  after  they  migrated  to  the  DPRK.  A  strong  supporter  of  the  DPRK,  the  witness  had  wanted  to  migrate  to  the  DPRK  with  his  family.  However,  due  to  his  work  with  Chongryon, he  was  asked  to  remain  in  Japan  and  continue his work there. Upon expressing an interest to his family in the DPRK to send  his  daughter  from  Japan  to  live there  in  their  care,  his  family  began  to  write  cryptic messages to him such as \u201cIt is better for children to stay with their parents \u201d, and \u201cGrandmother ate one piece of \\(something\\) and was very happy\u201d. The witness understood from these messages that his family did not think it was a good idea for him  to  send  his  daughter  there.  Later  able  to  visit  the  DPRK  himself  and  see  his  family  there,  he  saw  how  malnourished  they  were  and  timid  to  speak,  fearful  of  their monitors.\n\nThat piece of evidence is interesting none\\-the\\-less, but honestly regret can be expected by a person living in the DPRK shortly after the war \\(all buildings greater than 2 stories were leveled\\) given the material conditions in the DPRK at the time. However I heavily doubt the person would have felt much better in the ROK around the same time. This also seems to be quarterway decent evidence of censorship in the DPRK at the time, however it would be nice to have the actual letter to see the contents of the actual letter in order to know if the contents on the stamp differ much from the contents of the letter, and also there would need to be concrete evidence \\(not just testimonies\\) of penalty for expressing regret for working in the DPRK after the war as there could be a number of other reasons why the person wrote on the back of the stamp \\(endless people in the US use vpns, tor and other means of cryptography for non\\-illegal purposes\\). So I guess that was interesting but  it's nowhere near conclusive.The rest of the evidence is private books, testimonies of DPRK migrants, private media articles and other reports like this one published by the UN. There's no video footage, no fingerprints and literally one photo. There's lots of easily disprovable information on there too \\(e.g. \"no footage allowed in the DPRK\"\\) Reports like these were used to justify sanctions against the DPRK.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nEdit: Spacing","subreddit":"communism","title":"Brief analysis of DPRK human rights report by the Human Rights Council of the United Nations"}

This is often ridiculed by western media as part of the claimed \"personality cult\" because the Koreans often speak about what innovation a leader has personally suggested in their workplace. What is most commonly not told is the dialectic principle these field guidance trips are based upon. Mao described this well when he told us communists to be \"pupils of the masses as well as their teachers\". These trips are an opportunity for leaders to educate themselves about the situation in workplaces and the living situations of the people, as well as to offer support when it comes to administrative processes, questions of authority in the working place, diplomatic action and even some small innoventions from time to time, because that is what a communist leader - who has been elected by his people, meaning they share this opinion - is trained and good at. The trips are a great way to innovate thought of both the leader and the people and keep them in touch. Field guidance trips should therefore be undertaken by any leader that considers himself socialist and marxist-leninist, to learn and stay humble and in touch with the people and to teach and give where he or she can.","subreddit":"communism","title":"The Dialectics of Field Guidance as seen in the DPRK"}

I knew it was bad, but I was hoping it wouldn't get much worse. Maybe the underlying political tensions were really about stupid nonsense stirred up by the imperialist press regarding Mugabe's wife.\n\nBut this is a line too far. I really think anyone interested in socialism, communism, Marxism-Leninism, Maoism, or just general anti-imperialism, should no longer support this regime.\n\nThat doesn't mean I think the MDC and and remnants of Tsvangirai's clique deserve power. Far from it. They are rats, and will likely come to power anyway whenever the next elections are held (or the elections after that). And the only people to blame will be the ZANU-PF, who I predict will probably go the way of Hoxha's party in a few years.\n\nThis is ultimately a symbolic move toward a total capitulation to Western imperialism, and a rejection of everything the revolution stood for. Zimbabwe has become Rhodesia in blackface, and the ZANU-PF are consciously re-orienting themselves away from the masses of the world who are still resisting imperialism, hoping to get some crumbs for their efforts.\n\nThe only real question left in my mind is will the masses of people in Zimbabwe go along with it. I can't really say, but my hunch is that Western imperialism, in the short run, will do whatever they can to improve Zimbabwe's economy, which will make any internal resistance much less likely. Ideologically, I expect old ethnic tensions to pop up, as far from being an English-speaking country, Zimbabwe is actually many different people who speak different languages, with English being a mere lingua-franca, and internal resistance will likely come from a separatist group representing a single nation.\n\nCriticism welcome, though I will probably not respond. Maybe I've gone overboard here, so if anyone disagrees with this analysis, please state you reasons (I won't respond to them personally).","subreddit":"communism","title":"Zimbabwe and the British Commonwealth..."}

This brings the count to 23 accounts of school shootings where someone was at least hurt (or worse) this year. It breaks my heart every time I hear about these shooting, and it makes me fear for my own safety and for those around me. I work for a school district so you can see where this really hits home for me. It leaves the obvious question of what we can do about this?\nI've been seeing articles about suggesting arming teachers, loading schools up with armed guards, even a few minutes ago I read an article that suggest the Israeli model they use for their schools! There's just all of these crazy police state type ideas flying around, but very few people seem to want to address the patterns of these shooting; White males with sexist, racist, nationalistic or down right fully fascist ideals. This brings me to a VERY concerning tread in our schools. \n\nRecently our web filters (I work in IT for the district) have been sending us a disturbing amount of notifications (as many as 5 times a week) of students looking up/sending each other memes associated with alt-right and fascist groups. A very popular one is one with the caption \"Hitler did nothing wrong\" along with pepe. I have brought this to attention with our superintendent and his response was, \"It's just a bunch of asshole kids who think being edgy is cool\". I'd like to believe he is right, but I just don't. How do I convince administration to look deeper into these kids? How do I convince them that far-right political groups are targeting kids and radicalizing them(which they very prominently are around here)? I live in a place where racial tensions are high and I feel like one of the only ones (There are few people on my side) able to see the dangerous potential if this goes ignored. I'm frustrated and quite honestly scared to death. I don't know what to do aside from keeping every notification and building portfolios on students in case of an incident, but I fear that will only prove my point after it is to late should something actually happen...","subreddit":"communism","title":"Gun violence in the US; What can possibly be done?"}

I found out using [Luminous](https://gbaptista.github.io/luminous/doc/en-US/) *(this isn't an endorsement or ad)*, which is an extension that detects (and can block) JavaScript events. The old UI also listens for the `mousemove` event but not everywhere (I have only noticed it on the \"submit post\" page, but there are probably a few other places), though I'm not sure if this is due to session replay tracking. I cannot say for certain that the old UI doesn't have session replay or something similar, but to me it doesn't seem like it for most pages. Perhaps someone who has investigated this further can confirm or deny.\n\nSession replay is another form of tracking what you click on (possibly negating attempts to opt out of \"regular\" tracking of outbound links), can be used to fingerprint a user (how the mouse moves), and will negate attempts to delete posts and comments (for example, ones that accidentally contain personal information or passwords). Even accidentally pasting something like a password in a text box will result in the password being sent to Reddit (and/or a third party) and being stored in plain text. I don't know how Reddit manages user data internally, but with session recording it's possible that a Reddit employee playing back a session to assess user reaction to a new UI update may end up seeing your private messages or posts in private subreddits simply because it was there when you interacted with the page.\n\nAlso, the Reddit redesign *completely* breaks without JavaScript enabled, to the point where you can't click on links or even see the page content. \n\nThe old UI is still available to users, either through a setting in your account or (if you're not logged in) through `old.reddit.com`. You can also replace the 'www' part of the URL with 'old' on any Reddit page to get back to the old UI. I really, *really* hope they don't remove this.","subreddit":"privacy","title":"PSA: The Reddit redesigned UI is worse for privacy compared to the old UI.""num_comments":1,"score":14,"selftext":"","subreddit":"communism","title":"PSA: The Reddit redesigned UI is worse for privacy compared to the old UI."}
