She contended that it was, rather, a collection of ''camp folklore,'' containing ''raw material'' which her husband was planning to use in his future productions.\n\nsource https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2003\/06\/06\/world\/natalya-reshetovskaya-84-is-dead-solzhenitsyn-s-wife-questioned-gulag.html\n\nAnd let's not forget he was sentenced to 8 years in a fucking labour camp because he was guilty of the crime he was charged with:spreading anti-soviet sentiment during times of war.

In their letters they spoke of \u201cResolution No. 1\u201d which was their plan for a \u201cwar after the war\u201d in which they would right the so-called wrongs of Stalinism. They mocked Stalin as a \u201cbig shot\u201d and as \u201cthe moustachioed one.\u201d As the Soviet Union was under massive attack by the Wehrmacht and fighting for its very survival the Soviet leadership could not be expected to have a sense of humor about this sort of thing. Solzhenitsyn was arrested and charged with anti-Soviet propaganda and founding a hostile organization. The traitor could have faced the death penalty for his crimes, but instead received a sentence of 8 years in the labor camps.\n\nsource: Thomas, D.M., Alexander Solzhenitsyn: A Century in His Life, St. Martin\u2019s Press: New York, 1998.\n\nAlexanders other shitty stances (we've actually discussed this previously so feel free to check this thread.) \n\nSupported the Vietnam war and said the US should go back into Vietnam to finish off the commies \n\nAppeared on Spanish TV to praise Franco \n\nSaid\n\n&gt;    the German army could have liberated the Soviet Union from Communism but Hitler was stupid and did not use this weapon.\n\nhttps:\/\/blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk\/blog\/new-files-from-1983\/\n\nWho in the waning periods of his life revealed him for the fascist piece of shit that he was in his later book that blamed the jews \n\nhttps:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2003\/jan\/25\/russia.books\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn#On_Russia_and_the_Jews\n\nAnyway I'm just interested to hear comrades opinions regarding what the leader of the CWI writes about.

He\u2019s pretty easy to read and puts his ideas across clearly and concisely. \n\nHe has some pretty poor takes on class collaboration. In the first part he talks about how it is not true democracy unless every sect\/class has a say, which is pretty liberal imo. \n\nHe criticises any form of political party as a dictatorship, but I don\u2019t really see how what he was advocating as \u201cdirect democracy\u201d isn\u2019t really one party, I feel he skipped over it a fair bit and was pretty vague. Like where he\u2019s calling for direct representation from the unions, that could be interpreted as Soviets. \n\nHis take on religion being the source of law was pretty bad too, saying that all constitutions that were not based in religion were invalid was just a bit weird. \n\nHis ideas in the 3rd part are also generally not the best. Like how he so nearly gets women\u2019s rights right, but then goes onto say how they must be feminine and have a \u201cdifferent role in society to men\u201d, and his take on race politics was bad. I felt some of his takes on the family could also be pretty homophobic, how he was saying that anyone who did not continue the family surcumed to dictatorship was pretty bad seeing that gay people can only adopt (unless he doesn\u2019t mind that, but seeing that he says people who are devoid of a family are \u201ctramps\u201d kinda makes me think that), although given to context of the time and place it\u2019s kinda to be expected. \n\nHis economic takes were generally alright, I don\u2019t know how much he practiced what he said in this term, but would we count what he advocates as socialism in the Marxist sense? He seemed to be calling for a return to natural law, but idk if he means natural commodity production by that. His ideas on common ownership etc were decent tho. \n\nSo what\u2019s your thoughts on Gadaffi? More interested in what your takes on his economic style are, but general discussion is cool.

I see my comrades ridiculed, questioned and mostly just ignored. \n\n\nSo naturally, I've come to ignore Hope, or even shoot it down when I see it. But that's exactly what the capitalists want, and what puts liberals at ease. \n\n\n*History shows the march towards social progress is relentless and inevitable - because of us. *\n\nIn my country Antifa outnumber Nazis. While they're an ever-present danger, they're outnumbered. We'll keep them at bay, and Trump and the Alt-Right may give them a passing popularity *but we always win*. But even if that doesnt convince you to be hopeful, here\"s something:\n\n- Stay organised. Unity - the many fingers of the clenched fist together - is what will win. Show up to rallies for issues that dont directly affect you. Social media isnt enough. Canvas. Volunteer. Meet workers from all industries. Stand on a Picket line of 5 people; those other 4 people will remember that. \n\n- Stay emapathic. Communism knows no colour, creed or flag. Listen to other's struggles - their stuggle is your struggle and your struggle is theirs. Show other groups your common enemy (capitalists can take the form of friendly, yet exploitative managers) and build a coalition. As the late Jo Cox said before being murdered by a Nazi, \"We have more in common than that which divides us\" . See a friend on their way to the alt-right? Save them if you can! Listen to their frustrations, underatand their confusions and *help them understand.*\n\n- Stay motivated. From the Anti-Fa handbook, \"Fight them with phonecalls and letters so you dont have to fight them with fists. Fight them with fists so you dont have fight them with knives.

I always had an interest in studying psychology, and whenever possible I read something about this field. In part it comes from my parents, as both of them are from this area, and most of their lives they've studied anti-psychiatry. One of the authors they've recommended me was Thomas Szasz, a famous psychiatrist. I've read one of his books called \"[*The Manufacture of Madness: A Comparative Study of the Inquisition and the Mental Health Movement*](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=hpOcRRum3XEC&amp;printsec=frontcover)\", and basically, as the title already states, it makes a comparative study of the inquisition and the witch-hunting and the mental health movement, showing how those in a society that do not fit the standards of normality are stigmatized as witches or mentally insane, and how that plays a huge role in controlling a society. \n\nNow, it is pretty clear from the author that he is an anti-communist, but (at least in this book, and from what I've read in other places) he still has a critical view of the US society and other capitalist ones. The most interesting thing is that, from my perspective, the conclusions he arrives are pretty much compatible with a marxist analysis, and that's what made me want to make this post. I believe the biggest point he made in his career is that there is no such thing as \"mental illness\", and he wrote a book about it that unfortunately I haven't got the chance to read it, but there's a speech where he explains it in a very quick way and to me it was enough to at least consider looking more deeply into his arguments ([https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zQegsqYhuZE](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zQegsqYhuZE)). \n\nSo, after explaining all that, I wanted to ask you if you have ever heard of him, read him and have an opinion, as I've never saw marxists discussing about him. I believe there is a lot of valuable analysis in his work, specially about psychiatric control over a society, and wanted to hear your opinions on the matter and if you have suggestions it would be lovely! \n\nA luta continua!

In my role as First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party, I have the duty to assert that this is not, in the least, the purpose of this conceptual idea.\nThis is precisely about, compa\u00f1eras and compa\u00f1eros, calling things by their name and not hiding behind illogical euphemisms to mask reality. The increase in self-employment and the authorization to contract a workforce has led in practice to the existence of medium, small and micro private enterprises which today operate without proper legal status and are regulated under the law by a regulatory framework designed for individuals engaged in small business conducted by the worker and his\/her family.\n\nGuideline No.3 approved by the 6th Congress and which we intend to maintain and strengthen in the updated draft categorically specifies that \u201cIn the forms of non-state management, the concentration of property shall not be allowed\u201d and it is added \u201cnor of wealth\u201d; therefore, the private company will operate within well-defined limits and will constitute a complementary element in the economic framework of the country, all of which should be regulated by law.\n\nWe are not naive nor do we ignore the aspirations of powerful external forces that are committed to what they call the \u201cempowerment\u201d of non-state forms of management, in order to create agents of change in the hope of putting an end to the Revolution and socialism in Cuba by other means.\n\nCooperatives, self-employment and medium, small and micro private enterprise are not in their essence anti-socialist or counter-revolutionary and the enormous majority of those who work in them are revolutionaries and patriots who defend the principles and benefit from the achievements of this Revolution.\n\n\nSource: http:\/\/en.granma.cu\/cuba\/2016-04-18\/the-development-of-the-national-economy-along-with-the-struggle-for-peace-and-our-ideological-resolve-constitute-the-partys-principal-missions","subreddit":"communism","title":"Excerpt from Raul Castro's speech on the Cuban constitutional reform regarding the constitutional protection of private property."}

They are risking the renewed outbreak of class contradictions, class war, in their immediate environment. This is a circumstance that the European Bourgeoisie, in the development of the parasitic societies of the imperial core, often understood quite well and thus accepted the development of the socio-imperialistic social partnership. This did mean forking off a certain part of their profits, but that wasn't a one-sided deal: In return the Bourgeoisie of the core got social peace; the class war was shifted outside of their realm. For this reason, however, from a marxist-economic perspective, it is not obvious why the bourgeoisie should become greedy *now*. It is after all not like the shifting of the class war into \"foreign countries\" could work indefinitely - that much even the most irrational of the bourgeoisie know. And yet tthey do it. The re-ignition of class contradictions in the core is risked to enable reveling in the bribe money that was previously given to the labor aristocracy.\n\nIn spite of the position of the primary class contradictions between the worlds - between the first and third world, which mean between the imperial core and the periphery - the fight on non-primary contradictions is not to be omitted. Among others we see the parallel fight in the women's movement  as well as in the fight of non-whites against racism. While it is the primary contradiction, from which all others derive and on whose destiny all other contradictions depend, special developments make it possible for revolutionary movements to use non-primary contradictions to further the resolution of the primary contradiction. Such a situation is exactly the one we see now in Europe and especially in Austria. In the historic context this is far from the first such situation. The fight of proletarian interest, since the time of Marx and Engels, always stood in the tradition of such non-primary fights, but primary, imperialistic contradiction and secondary, national class contradiction were still quite close to each other. Only the social fights of the proletarian class at the end of the 19th century and their hard-won improvement of living standards, their higher wages etc. first lead to the slow increase of the \"distance\" between primary and secondary contradiction. This distance is the one that describes the \"productive overflow\" from actions on the secondary level to the primary. It should be said as well, that it isn't the worker's fight in and of itself that increases this distance; instead the source of this increase lies in the decisions of the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe workers' fight in capitalism is always a fight against the exploitation of labour power through surplus value extraction. The goal of the bourgeoisie is the maximization of its profits, this surplus value extraction, while the goal of the workers is, in contrast, the minimization or complete abolishment of this surplus value extraction. In a society in which no value crosses the borders of this society - which means that all value created in the country stays in it and is eventually consumed - and no externally created value enters this society, the workers' fight eventually leads to the expropriation and abolishment of the bourgeoisie, which in turn leads to the abolishment of the proletariat and to a classless, communist society. However, Europe's and North America's history in isolation is of a different nature. They profited during the transition from feudalism into capitalism long before the exploitation of their colonies, which one-sidedly shipped value into the core, leading to an inevitable surplus of value. When the workers of the core started to stand up for more than their subsistence wages and waging the flames of contradiction between proletariat and bourgeoisie, the bourgeoisie had to make a decision. In any case the workers would receive more value - the amount depending on the nature of class conflict. But where would the bourgeoisie get this value? From the value surplus created from the exploitation of the colonies.\n\nFor the Bourgeoisie this doesn't make much of a difference - their bottom line, the amount of profit lost, won't change. But the repeated application of this principle does make a difference. Demands for wage increase, welfare, pension systems and unemployment money start appearing. All these improvements in the living standard of the imperial core - a standard that in this way exists only there - are the result of the local workers' fights. But the fights' success- and bountiful results are in turn caused by the higher liquidity of the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie acted, as we know today, increasingly more forthcoming towards these demands into the 20th century. Of course the rate of profit for the bourgeoisie was lessened, but this was a sacrifice worth making, as they now had to worry less about social chaos, while still being filthy rich! This development, especially the partnership between bourgeoisie and proletariat, from an international perspective, became increasingly obvious only in the 1920s and 30s. The Proletariat was now completely robbed of its internationalism and became part of the nation state, which was now responsible for caring for their welfare. The economically-political co-development of this was corporatism, or to put it into \"friendlier\" terms, the social partnership.\n\nWhat, now, is the previously mentioned intermediary step in the causal chain?\n\nIt is in the interest of the rational bourgeoisie to lessen the local class conflict and at the same time it is their decision to use the value surplus from the colonies on their own working class. As previously mentioned, this was initially limited to simple payments, as in paying more wages that could be afforded through the value surplus. But this developed, more and more, into an integral part of the capitalist system in the core. The value surplus, was, among other things, institutionalized through wages, social systems or pension systems and became the absolute standard. The intermediate step in the causal chain is thus the decision of the bourgeoisie to use the profits of the exploitation overseas to alleviate the class conflict at home and keep the, oh so important for the bourgeoisie, social peace.\n\nBut this has been forgotten by the bourgeoisie in the light of the events of recent years. They have become greedy once more and are now sacrificing the social peace they secured through exploitation of the periphery to bolster their profits.\n\nFor us communists, as absolutely consistent internationalists, this is an important moment.\n\nWith a rational bourgeoisie our work was and would be made significantly harder. All mass politics would have to be built on socio-imperialistic politics. It would be impossible to perform actually revolutionary agitation within the parasitic working class. Their short-term interests simply don't match such a future, it would belong to social imperialism. Previous, actually revolutionary communist organizations also faced all these problems. As a consequence it was no longer tried to extract cheap, small and temporary successes from the wider masses. Instead one knew to, as far as it was possible, reverse the flow of value between first and third world or at least support national liberation movements in the periphery in any form.\n\nThese tactics are still of grand importance in a society led by irrational bourgeoisie, but we can additionally start riding the wave of class conflict of the secondary contradiction in such a society. As such it is our task to perform revolutionary agitation in the wake of public uproar over the 12-hour day and similar incisions and also to use this uproar of the core workers along with the exploitation of the migrants staying in the core to build a wide revolutionary movement. For communists, revolutionary and consequent internationalists, the time for such work has come now. We need to know how to use this chance by throwing old, dogmatic class analysis over board and putting our actions under a new, global class analysis.\n\nIn Austria, but also in Germany, Switzerland and Europe in general, it must now be our task to use these temporary possibilities of social unrest to agitate and for our propaganda. Also to wake up the workers who haven't already subscribed to the machinations of the global bourgeoisie and try to establish on this a broad, revolutionary, communist, internationalist movement and try to unite it with the interests of the internationally exploited and exiled.\n","subreddit":"communism","title":"On the irrational Bourgeoisie and the perspectives of a proletarian movement in the (imperial) core.

The only democracy and the only sovereignty in the US is the democracy of the rich and the sovereignty of their capital.\n\n3) Liberals claim that Trump is \"treasonous\" for not believing the words of the CIA and instead trusting Putin's word that he did not interfere in the elections. Treasonous against what? The bourgeois state? Against the words of the CIA, that same institution that led the overthrow and interference of countless countries' elections? Is he treasonous against the international ruling class because he opposes free trade, rewriting NAFTA and demolishing the TPP? The rallying cry for the left can never be that Trump is treasonous, as if our bourgeois democracy is so holy and sacred and he has violated all that was pure in our world. No, Trump is simply a reflection of the rottenness of our system, not the cause of it.\n\nTo summarize, the object of our political struggle cannot be echoing the rallying call of the corporate Democrats \"it's the Russians!\" No, Trump is not reactionary because of Russia. Trump is reactionary because he seeks tax cuts for the rich, for increasing the strength of the border, for being racist and sexist, for seeking to crush unions more and more. The Democrats don't hesitate to criticize Trump for the Russia scandal, but when class politics turn their head and the question of his tax cuts for the rich arises, we are met with reticence and silence. This is because it is in their class interest to support such measures.\n\nThe working class must absolutely struggle against the extremely reactionary and vulgar Trump, but the political struggle against Trump must be on its own class lines in its own class interests. We oppose the domination of Trump, the rich capitalists, and their Republican and Democrat cronies; our duty is to struggle for a revolutionary party of the working class in the United States and internationally.\n","subreddit":"communism","title":"Why the Marxist Left is opposed to (and does not participate in) the Liberal anti-Russia hysteria""num_comments":0,"score":2,"selftext":"","subreddit":"WayOfTheBern","title":"\"We oppose the domination of Trump, the rich capitalists, and their Republican and Democrat cronies; our duty is to struggle for a revolutionary party of the working class in the United States and internationally.\""}

Just thought I\u2019d mention it in case anyone saw this on \/r\/communism101 and is wondering why I\u2019ve posted the same thread in both subreddits.)\n\nHi comrades, I\u2019ve recently been thinking a lot about the reasons behind the lack of leftist activity\/popularity in the first world. What I\u2019m essentially wondering about is whether this problem is basically our fault for being too sectarian or out of touch with the masses, whether it\u2019s a result of the fact that supporting imperialism is in the class interests of the majority of first worlders, or whether it\u2019s due to something else entirely that I haven\u2019t thought of. My specific questions are as follows:\n\n1) How do those who believe first world workers are incapable of becoming communists due to the fact that maintaining imperialism is in their class interests explain why those of us on this subreddit have ended up becoming communists? Is it basically just a coincidence that we were exposed to communist ideas and were open-minded enough to listen? Or is there some more in-depth explanation for why some first worlders become communists despite the fact that it goes against our class interests? I suppose this could also apply to class traitors from the bourgeoisie - is there anything in particular that causes someone to betray their class? \n\n2) What are the reasons behind the sectarianism and ineffectiveness of first world communist organisations? Is it simply due to the collapse of the USSR and the overwhelming prevalence of bourgeois propaganda, or are there other reasons I\u2019m not aware of?\n\n3) If it is true that revolution in the first world is currently impossible due to imperialism, what are the tasks of first world communists in the present day? \n\n4) Are there any theories or predictions about how things will unfold in the future? I have a (probably misguided and ill-informed) personal theory that third world countries will, one by one, have socialist revolutions and kick the imperialists out, then once there are no countries left for the imperialists to exploit, the economies of first world countries will collapse and lead to some kind of revolution in the first world (although whether this revolution will be a communist one is doubtful). Obviously I\u2019m not looking for anyone to give an in-depth critique of this vague idea of mine, but if someone could tell me if I\u2019m sort of on the right track or if I\u2019ve got the wrong end of the stick completely, I would appreciate it. \n\nI know this is a long post and a lot of questions, so I won\u2019t mind if anyone just answers one or two of my questions in their response. I would also definitely appreciate any reading recommendations on anything to do with the subject I\u2019m asking about, particularly the situation and tasks of modern first world communists. Thank you in advance for any answers or suggestions! :)","subreddit":"communism","title":"Questions on Third Worldism and the possibility of revolution in the first world"}

I will explain as briefly as I can; please add anything or criticize as you see fit, comrades.\n\n0) First, a side point: so much of the anti-Russia propaganda is completely unsubstantiated where no neutral body was allowed to examine the \"evidence\" given by the intelligence services; e.g., Assad's chemical weapons attacks in Syria and the claim by British intelligence that Russia nerve gassed someone in England. Simply through constant repetition by the cacophonous corporate media we observe that rumour becomes allegation, allegation becomes fact, and fact becomes a universal undeniable truth.\n\n1) Liberals claim that Russia interfering in the US elections means that Russia is our enemy and the country must unite against Putin. This is national chauvinism to the highest degree. Marxists do not support one reactionary bourgeois state versus another reactionary bourgeois state. Both the US and Russia are reactionary countries dominated by rich oligarchs. We oppose both. We will neither support nor ally with the bourgeois of one country in their efforts against the other.\n\n2) Liberals claim that Russia has violated our sovereignty by interfering in our democracy. What democracy? You mean the capitalist, bourgeois democracy? Was it Putin that created the electoral college, or the first-past-the-post system? Is it Putin that owns the 6 media companies in the US that control 90% of what every American sees, reads, and hears?

I'm in the planning phase currently and have found an abundance of evidence supporting this idea in the context of the industrial working class, which made up (I think) about 25% of the population. However, my argument sort of falls apart if it was only supported by the workers and not the peasants that made up the largest portion of the population. So I was wondering if anyone has any sources to suggest that the Bolsheviks, or at least the October Revolution itself had peasant support? Of course the SRs were the traditional peasant party, but in *10 days that shook the world*, John Reed suggests in the final chapter that Lenin organised some kind of alliance? I would just use that as my source but its quite vague and confusing, so I'm wondering if anyone here can help me out. Thanks.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Peasant support for Bolsheviks?"}

Reading just some basic histories of the PCI really struck me that they, throughout their history, seemed to do as much as possible to avoid violence, direct action or anything resembling a proletarian revolutionary movement.\n\nDuring the rise of Mussolini, the formation of the Arditi del Popolo and similar militant anti-fascist squads wasn't supported by either the PSI or the PCI, at least officially. Definitely members of the parties participated but Bordiga wasn't supportive of antifascism (something a lot of leftcoms still do today). The leadership of the PCI did not support militant anti-fascism before World War 2, basically. This isn't exactly unheard of; [some of the KPD leadership that later got expelled was collaborating with the NSDAP in the 30s while communists in the street fought Nazis](https:\/\/libcom.org\/library\/investigation-red-brown-alliances-third-positionism-russia-ukraine-syria-western-left) and the PSI basically signed a peace treaty with Mussolini.\n\nIt wasn't until World War 2, under different leadership, that the PCI began an underground resistance working with other Italian non-leftist resistance.\n\nYears go by, PCI grows and grows and has a lot of local influence. They have some disagreements with Soviet policy and actions, and post-1969 are basically an anti-Soviet party. But things really heat up during the Years of Lead. Eastern Bloc-backed Red Brigades are engaging in an urban guerrilla campaign, again something not out of place for the times (Weathermen in the US, RAF in Germany with actions in Scandinavia, Angry Brigade, Official IRA\/Provisional IRA\/Irish National Liberation Army, the ETA in Spain, Japanese Red Army and the later United Red Army, whatever that splinter group from the RCP was called). The PCI condemned them, iirc collaborated against them and later the Red Brigades attacked PCI leaders and kidnapped a Christian Democrats member which killed the attempted coalition.\n\nThe later history of the PCI is basically splits, watering down Eurocom to social democracy and then just giving up in 1991. \n\nI guess what's interesting to me is that the PCI was a massive party which early on recieved massive Soviet aid and experienced three different insurrectionary campaigns in its history. Yet in all three times it wasn't really supportive of them. It condemned the anti-fascist movement and played a role in keeping the Italian left divided. Then, it only really resumed operations officially in 1944, pretty late into WW2. Then finally, it actively worked against the Red Brigades.\n\nMore than any other Communist Party I can think of the PCI put a lot of effort into not being revolutionary. It did a lot of cool stuff in terms of reforms but I really cannot think of another party that worked harder at not being a militant party. In its historical context, it's not like revolution wasn't possible: worldwide revolts and guerrilla campaigns were ongoing; the Soviet Union was still a major political power (regardless of their official politics); the PCI had a *massive* base in Italy and control over many localities; fearing coups, members of the PCI were apparently trained by the Stasi and KGB; the Years of Lead saw a plethora of far-left guerrilla movements in Italy with some popular support, not limited to the Red Brigades, across the left spectrum from anarchists to autonomists to hardline MLs.  \n\nWhy do people think the PCI took this strong parliamentary or nonviolent position? What does say about the PCI or its various leaders? \n\nnote: I'm not Italian or an expert in Italian history. If I have something wrong please correct me.

Secondly, they\u2019re part of the labour aristocracy, and the labour aristocracy is not our priority. No communist thinks what these people are doing is wrong or that they should be shamed for it; we simply don\u2019t believe that their opinions or desires should be our primary focus when discussing the sex industry. Our primary focus as communists should always be on the exploited majority, not the privileged minority. We don\u2019t argue that some privileged members of the labour aristocracy \u201clove their jobs\u201d or \u201cchoose\u201d to do them when other forms of wage labour are criticised, do we? So why do we do this when the sex industry is criticised?\n\n\n**But keeping sex work criminalised is harmful to sex workers.**\n\nYes, of course. No communist thinks sex workers should be arrested or punished; that\u2019s obviously reactionary and misogynistic. The debate is between supporters of full legalisation and supporters of the Nordic model. I won\u2019t go into this debate here; it\u2019s a separate subject. \n\n\n**What about porn? What do communists think of that? What do you think of \u201cfeminist porn\u201d which has become a trend lately?**\n\nIt\u2019s highly exploitative and often misogynistic, racist and homophobic in the most disgusting ways. Sure, you can probably find morally acceptable \u201cfeminist porn\u201d somewhere, and sure, erotic content could probably exist in some form under communism, but that isn\u2019t our concern right now. We don\u2019t care about reassuring liberal \u201ccommunists\u201d that they can find \u201cethical porn\u201d or that they can still get all their sexual desires met under socialism. We care about opposing the sex industry under capitalism and helping the people who are victimised by it. Anyone whose immediate reaction to this viewpoint is anything along the lines of \u201cbut not all porn is like that, you know\u201d or \u201cbut we will still have some kind of porn under communism, right?\u201d is a reactionary who is more concerned about their own sexual satisfaction than about the millions of people, mainly women and girls, who are victimised by the sex industry. \n\n\nIf anyone has any criticisms or anything you think I should add, please let me know.

I'm making this post mostly because I've been thinking about this stuff for more than a year and have had no real meaningful and open dialogue with anyone except a select group of friends. About a year and a half ago, I went from a moderate Liberal with some pretty mild leftist ideals, to starting to hold more outright socialistic beliefs. At first it didn't phase me, I just continued to grow as my own person and evolving my beliefs. I'd say about six months into my gradual and slow transformation, I realized I no longer could call myself a liberal, because frankly Liberal policies made me kinda disgusted. It was a weird realization, mostly because the only person i knew at the time who was a socialist was a friend of mine several states away who was also a die hard anarchist, not really aligning with my beliefs. I should mention I'm in my senior year of High school now, in a pretty conservative state. This realization came almost exactly a year ago though, and i didn't really explore it much besides a few jokes with friends about how I loved the USSR.\n\nThe main reason i didn't explore if I was a Communist a year ago was my girlfriend. She was a hardcore liberal, like absolutely 100% liberal. honestly, not even that much of a liberal as she held no real, substantial views, except one thing, Donald Trump is bad, Democrats are good. So, for the past year, I sort of just explored my political identity and beliefs on my own. I taught myself as much as i could realistically about Marxist theory, all without tripping people's alarms. I talked with my best friend about Soviet policy because, like me, he is a huge history buff with a big hard on for Soviet history during WW2. I would say the final nail in the coffin, the thing that made me finally realize I was just a Socialist, were, ironically, fucking memes. It's weird to say, but the thing that made me actually commit to reading more and more Marxist literature and accepting that i was just a fucking Communist, was the fact there are so many fucking absolute morons. I can't fucking tell you how many times I've been put in this weird position of trying to convince people the Nazis were bad on a meme page that posted a meme about the Red army. I remember one specific instance, around November of last year, where i read *Marxism and The National Question* when i got into an argument with some neo-fascist reactionary asshole about how Hitler actually didn't want to kill all Jewish and Slavic peoples, but Stalin hated minorities 100%. After that, i was on little reading spree. I started reading PDF's of Das Kapital, The Communist Manifesto, and Lenin's Imperialism.(Keep in mind, i've only read all of the Communist Manifesto, I intend to finish the other literature it's just i tended to not have time when i started them) Arguing with reactionary holocaust deniers and moral relativists that declare the Soviets to be the REAL bad guys did more to push me to describing myself as a communist than any personal introspection, not because i didn't genuinely hold these beliefs beforehand, but because it scared me how those around me would react. Only until i was faced with literal fascists did I accept that i was a Socialist. At first i just described myself as a super left leaning social democrat, but that felt disingenuous so i stopped. Now, i avoid labels and just focus on the substance of what I believe. \n\nThis post is mainly for myself. It's kinda me putting a minimal version of my ideological journey over the course of the past nearly two years. Also, if you guys could give me some suggestions in terms of literature and authors, that would be really helpful. Id' like to think I've developed a fairly decent understanding of theory but I DEFINITELY need more practical literature and shit.\n\nThanks, appreciate it.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Hello, I have some stuff I need to get off my chest."}

At the time, a new political parry grew in popularity, and I supported (no matter what they did) the party because it looked very leftist.\n\nThen, when I was 13, I disvovered communism, not as something that was good, but rather as a simple dictatorship (as Franco's or Mussolini's), due to the famous 100 miLliON deAThs By CoMMUnisM. But I kept researching about the topic, while I was defending the other political party.\n\nAnd, finally, when I was 14, I understood communism as an ideology that exist to help the poors of the world, the proletariat, by taking the power by violence from the bourgeoisie. This was also the year I finally read The Communist Manifesto, and about Che Guevara and Fidel Castro.\n\nI am looking forward to read more leftist theory.\n\nThanks for all of this, comrades.","subreddit":"communism","title":"A personal history with communism."}
