Their statement can be found here: https://marxist.ca/socialist-fightback-student/1328-fightback-s-reponse-to-cupe-3903-ban.html . Students for CUPE 3903 have also now published a statement, which can be found here: https://pastebin.com/7TUSVWkH ).\n\n\nWhat follows is an account of the events which \nlead up to the expulsion of Fightback from both the CUPE 3903 picket lines and the Students for CUPE 3903 support coalition. It has been put together so that people across Canada can gain an understanding of how much of a terrible and cult-like organization Socialist Fightback is.\n\n\nFor background: on March 5 units 1, 2, and 3 of CUPE 3903 (representing graduate student academic workers, contract professors, and grading assistants respectively) began their strike. Key issues in this strike include: York\u2019s elimination of 800 jobs from unit 3, a sexual assault survivor\u2019s support fund administered by the union, more job security for contract faculty, and guaranteed funding for graduate student workers. \n\n\nA number of student groups including the Revolutionary Student Movement and Students Against Israeli Apartheid came together to form a support coalition in order to organize undergraduate solidarity with the striking workers. Initially Fightback was excluded from the coalition due to their terrible reputation and reluctance of other campus groups to work with them. However they were eventually invited to join on condition of agreeing to a points of unity which included things like: Fightback should be beholden to the collective decisions of the coalition, Fightback should refrain from hogging the spotlight and claiming the work of others, and no propaganda behind a paywall on the picket lines. Fightback ostensibly agreed to these conditions.\n\n\nShortly after tensions with Fightback flared. Fightback did not abide by the decisions of the coalition, tried to brand coalition events as their own, and then stacked coalition meetings with paper members who were only interested in voting on issues but not carrying out the tasks collectively decided on. Fightback was then expelled from the coalition shortly before March 21. A letter on behalf of the coalition was delivered to Fightback, which included broad criticisms but also specific reference to Fightback\u2019s history of failing to substantively deal with issues of sexual harassment and assault.\n\n\nOn March 21, Students for CUPE 3903 decided to reclaim the York Senate chambers in response to York\u2019s senate again neglecting to suspend classes for the duration of the strike. While Fightback was present for the initial senate demonstration, they left when the Senate was occupied, only returning hours later when it became clear that the police would not expel the reclaimers. Despite this, \n\nFightback was quick to jump on social media and brand the occupation as theirs: a Facebook event titled something like \u201cJoin Socialist Fightback at the Senate Occupation\u201d was put up before Fightback was even at the Senate. Fightback also refused to abide by the will of the reclaimed Senate, and sought out media interviews to brand the reclamation as their own initiative. Fightback also refused to fully integrate with the reclamation, even having their own food table rather than contribute to the collective supplies of the reclaimers. This did little to build good-will with the other reclaimers and tensions in the Senate Chambers remained high.\n\n\nThat night, at the first general assembly of the reclaimed Senate chambers, Fightback put forward two controversial motions. First, they sought to have the occupation condemn the Liberals and Conservatives and make a series of specific demands to pressure the NDP to the left. Second, Fightback put forward a motion on \u201cLeft Unity\u201d which amounted to a request to now allow criticism of Fightback. \n\n\nAt this point, a former member of Fightback and a survivor or sexual assault got up and criticized Fightback\u2019s handling of her own case. She was shouted down by Fightback members, who yelled \u201cSlander!\u201d in order to silence her. The general assembly concluded, and tensions were still high.\n\n\nThe next day, on March 22, the conflict erupted again, this time in front of a broader audience. Fightback moved a motion to expel from the Senate individuals who \u201csabotage the movement\u201d; a thinly veiled attempt to remove from the Senate those who brought allegations forward against Fightback. Fightback was expelled from the reclaimed Senate, and then opted to leave what they declared to be a \u201ctoxic environment.\u201d The reclamation continued, and was decidedly more positive in the absence of Fightback.\n\n\nOn March 26, at a CUPE 3903 Strike Committee meeting, two competing motions were brought forward. First, Fightback distributed a letter [https://pastebin.com/r59KqBZ8] which denied their knowledge of the accusations against them, attempted to paint themselves as a victim, and asked CUPE 3903 to adjudicate a process to determine their guilt. Their statement was ripped to shreds; it was pointed out that Fightback denied responsibility, and that their statement was basically a carbon-copy of the worst statements of denial exposed by the #MeToo movement. \n\nDemonstrating the completely tone-deaf approach to mass work displayed by Fightback, a Fightback member proceeded to re-read the statement at the meeting after it had been critiqued. Ultimately the strike committee passed a second motion: in solidarity with the reclaimed Senate in their decision to expel Fightback.\n\n\nOn March 28, CUPE 3903 held its weekly Special General Membership Meeting. At this meeting a motion was brought form the floor [https://pastebin.com/TnBBLVmi] to ban Fightback from CUPE 3903 picket lines. The motion was passed unanimously, with only a handful of abstentions.\n\n\nIt\u2019s worth pointing out that at every step here, the anti-Fightback motions have not been brought forward by other left-wing organizations as part of a sectarian quest to exclude Fightback. Instead, Fightback has managed to alienate nearly the entire active membership of CUPE 3903 through it\u2019s terrible gender practice and ham-fisted approach to struggles. \n\n\nIn the following days, conversations on the picket lines have frequently touched on Fightback\u2019s practice as the members of CUPE 3903 react in disgust at their actions. Numerous stories from past Fightback members have emerged, indicating that these problems have existed for a substantial time in the organization. Fightback has an inability to engage in self-criticism; this has produced a toxic internal culture whereby there is no possible way of dealing with gender-based violence. We present this in order to let others know the current state of Fightback at York, and as a cautionary tale for those looking to get involved in Fightback in the future.\n","subreddit":"Canadian_Socialism","title":"Socialist Fightback Banned from CUPE 3903 Picket Lines for Abusive Behaviour, Sexual Misconduct""num_comments":1,"score":2,"selftext":"[deleted]","subreddit":"communism","title":"Socialist Fightback (IMT) Banned from CUPE 3903 Picket Lines for Abusive Behaviour, Sexual Misconduct"}

After three months of heavy fighting, the Philippine Army is losing. We've seen dozens of tactical offensives on the side of the NPA this past three months, most of them successful. Meanwhile, the Philippine Army is largely unsuccessful with their own offensives, despite the huge numbers advantage. The NPA clearly has the support and sympathy of the majority in the countryside that's keeping the AFP blind in the strongest revolutionary bases.\n\nFurthermore, the NPA, despite the \"fake news\" garbage of thousands of surrenderees, is clearly growing. There are already major tactical offensives in other areas outside Mindanao. The urban mass movement is growing, and raising the number of deployed cadres to the countryside. The Third Rectification Movement versus growing tendencies of empiricism and reformism is clearly making a mark, and the gains are being accelerated by an unprecedented social crisis currently roiling the Philippines.\n\nMeanwhile, the Moro secessionist resistance is also growing. Duterte is being besieged by political enemies on all sides. The masses, unlike what paid Facebook trolls would like you to believe, are already disgusted with the regime. Duterte is fast losing his once secure grip to power.\n\nThat is why Duterte wants to resume peace talks. He wants to take on his enemies one by one, and is cleaarly shaken by the growing strength of the people's resistance.\n\nThe CPP knows this. It's not going into peace negotiations ignorant. It has already learned the major lessons from the first peace negotiations with Cory Aquino in the late 1980s, as well as some minor strategic mistakes with the first few rounds of negotiations with the current Duterte regime.\n\nDuterte is losing.

I do hope that it\u2019s accessible and easy to navigate and read.\n\n*****\n\n**The Soviet Anarchists**\n\nI\u2019d like to make something clear from the start that lots of modern anarchists fail to recognise. Scores of anarchists in Soviet Russia were ardent defenders of the Soviet regime; giving their energy in battle, their lives at the front and their participation in the soviet institutions. The Bolsheviks worked alongside these anarchists and regarded them as their comrades.\n\nFour anarchists, Bogatsky, Bleikhman, Shatov and Iatshurk were members of the Military Revolutionary Committee which carried out the October Revolution \u2014 the insurrection which today\u2019s anarchists (wrongfully) denounce as a coup d'\u00e9tat. The armed detachment carrying out the orders of the Soviet Government to dissolve the Constituent Assembly was led by an anarchist named Anatoly Zheleteznyakov. Almost all anarchists were opposed to the bourgeois Constituent Assembly in revolutionary Russia, yet today\u2019s anarchists denounce the Bolsheviks\u2019 decision to dissolve it as having been \u201canti-democratic\u201d. How ironic!\n\nAn extract from Jeff Hemmer gives more detail about the aforementioned Vladimir Shatov and other anarchists who staunchly defended the Soviet regime:\n\n&gt;\u201cA member of the Military Revolutionary Committee in 1917, Shatov became the chief of police in Petrograd in 1918. In 1919 he defended Petrograd against the advance of General Yudenich as an officer in the Tenth Red Army, and in 1920 was appointed Minister of Transport in the Far Eastern Republic. A number of other anarchists followed his example and accepted small government posts, urging their comrades to do the same or at least refrain from anti-Bolshevik activities that would jeopardize the revolution. The Bolshevik cause attracted anarchists from all backgrounds, ranging from former Black Banner terrorists like Heitzman and Roschin to Anarcho-Communists like German Sandomirskii, who took a position in Chicherin\u2019s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, and Alexander Ge, according Victor Serge one of the organisers of Red Terror in the Terek region. Other well-known anarchists in the service of the Bolsheviks were the Anarcho-Syndicalists Shapiro, who joined Sandomirskii in the Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, and Daniil Novomirskii, in 1905 a prominent figure in syndicalist circles in Odessa, who entered the Communist Party and became a Comintern official in 1919\u2026\n\n&gt;In spring 1918 the Anarcho-Communist Apollon Karelin formed the pro-Bolshevik All-Russian Federation of Anarchist-Communists in Moscow, arguing that a Soviet dictatorship was acceptable as a transitional phase in the development of a free anarchist society. According to Karelin, the defence of the Soviet Government was to be regarded not as an affirmation of authority, but as a means of protecting the revolution. A similar view was put forward by the Moscow-based Universalists, formed in 1920 by the brothers Gordin, who had previously been rabid anti-Marxists and anti-intellectuals, and German Askarov, an Anarchist-Communist who was also a member of the Soviet Central Executive Committee [as was Karelin from 1918 \u2013 MM]. Roschin, the former Chernoznamenets and staunch anti-Marxist who, in 1919, came to see the Bolsheviks as \u201cthe advance guard of the revolution,\u201d seems to have taken these ideas even further; according to Victor Serge, he tried to develop an \u201canarchist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat.\u201d\n\n&gt;The support from the \u201cSoviet Anarchists\u201d was welcomed by the Bolshevik leadership, who insisted that the only anarchists that were persecuted in Russia were criminal elements.\u201d ^[1]\n\nIt is, of course, precisely these \u201ccriminal elements\u201d that we shall now discuss.\n\n*****\n\n**The Dawn Of Anarchist Black Guards**\n\n&gt;\u201cIn the first period of Soviet power, a lot of bands flourished in Great Russia. They were all annihilated long ago: their guiltiest members were shot, and the rest are expiating their crimes in places of detention. The same fate awaits the bandits of Ukraine. Firm, reliable units have been sent to all parts of the Ukraine, with the task of finding and collecting arms, catching deserters and exterminating bands. The purge will be carried through to the end.\u201d ^[2]\n\n&gt;\u2013 LEON TROTSKY (A WORD TO THE UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS MISLED BY BANDITS).\n\nBefore talking about Nestor Makhno and his Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine, one first has to understand where this Makhnovist \u201cBlack Army\u201d came from. The answer lies in the anarchist Black Guards which flourished throughout Russia and Ukraine in 1918. Originally created in Alexandrovsk during the summer of 1917 by Maria Nikiforova, these armed anarchist detachments had spread to Moscow by January 1918, and by April 1918 \u201cthere were already more than 50 groups and detachments of the Black Guard, numbering some 2,000 militants\u201d In the city. ^[3]\n\n\u201cAll groups and organisational units of the Black Guard were grouped around the Council of the MFAG [Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups \u2013 MM] and headquarters of the Black Guard, stationed in the House of Anarchy in Malaya Dmitrovka.\u201d ^[4] Nestor Makhno would later establish similar detachments in different regions of Ukraine which ultimately grew into the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine.\nAccording to the American anarchist historian Paul Avrich, the MFAG armed the Black Guards \u201cwith rifles, pistols, and grenades. From their headquarters in the House of Anarchy, the leaders of the Federation tried to impose a measure of discipline on the Black Guardsmen and to limit the activities of the local clubs to the distribution of propaganda and the \u201crequisitioning\u201d of private residences. This proved to be an impossible task; once armed, a number of groups and isolated individuals succumbed to the temptation of carrying out \u201cexpropriations,\u201d and, adding insult to injury, they sometimes acted in the name of the Federation.\u201d ^[5]\n\nAvrich explains that \u201carmed detachments of Black Guards\u2026 held up banks, shops and private homes. Many of their comrades \u2014 especially the \u201cSoviet anarchists\u201d \u2013 condemned such acts as parodies of the libertarian ideal, which wasted precious lives, demoralized the movement\u2019s true adherents and discredited anarchism in the eyes of the general public.\u201d ^[6]\n\nLooting was rife among the Black Guards. The leadership of the MFAG seemed unable to discipline its detachments. The Bolshevik (and former anarchist) Victor Serge wrote that  \u201cThe anarchists themselves admitted that suspicious elements, adventurers, common criminals and counter-revolutionaries, were thriving among them, but their libertarian principles did not permit them to refuse entrance to their organizations to any man, or to subject anyone to real control. They sensed acutely that their movement needed to be purged, but this was impossible without authority or a disciplined organization. Splits among them and this reverence for principle was slowly leading to the political suicide of the movement, which was becoming more compromised each day\u2026\u201d ^[7]\n\nThe situation was \u2014 excuse the pun \u2014 anarchic. The Black Guards were out of control. \u201cSeveral incidents such as an attack on an American car, the murder of several Cheka agents followed by the summary execution of several bandits, the arrests of \u201cexpropriators\u201d who were promptly claimed by the Anarchist Federation, led Dzerzhinsky, the President of the Cheka, to insist on the liquidation of the Black Guard.\u201d ^[8]\n\nAvrich gives the details of this operation:\n\n&gt;\u201c[O]n the night of the 11-12th of April, armed detachments of the Cheka raided 26 anarchist centres in the capital. Most anarchists surrendered without a fight, but in the Donskoi Monastery and the House of Anarchy itself, Black Guardsmen offered fierce resistance. A dozen Cheka agents were slain in the struggle, about 40 anarchists were killed or wounded, and more than 500 were taken prisoner.\u201d ^[9]\n\nAnarchist propagandists with their dishonest \u201cselective memory\u201d take this evening\u2019s events out of historical context; treating it in isolation and ignoring the backwards trend of conflict that the anarchist Black Guards had been unleashing in Russia. The Bolsheviks had been forced into carrying out the task that the anarchists were seemingly incapable of achieving on their own; purging from their ranks the \u201ccriminal elements\u201d that were pillaging and burgling under the flag of anarchism and causing chaos throughout Russia. As the elected and legitimate government it was their obligation to restore order.\n\nThe Bolsheviks sought to eradicate these \u201ccriminal elements\u201d which were considered to be \u201cpseudo-anarchists.\u201d In their view no genuine anarchist could condone random acts of theft and violence against workers and the soviets\u2019 officials. Trotsky stated in Moscow on the 14th of April that \u201cthese hooligans\u2026 are simply raiders and burglars who compromise the anarchists. Anarchism is an idea although a mistaken one, but hooliganism is hooliganism\u2026 I have talked about it to the idealist anarchists and they themselves say: \u2018A lot of these jailbirds, hooligans, and criminals have smuggled themselves into our movement\u2026\u2019\u2026 It is stated that among these hooligans there are a few who are honest anarchists; if that is true\u2026 then it is a great pity, and it is necessary to render them their freedom as quickly as possible.\u201d  His general argument was that the \u201chonest anarchists\u201d should distance themselves from the \u201chooligans\u201d so that \u201cone should know once for all\u2026 that is a burglar, and this is an honest idealist\u2026\u201d This was not an attack against anarchism or the \u201chonest\u201d anarchists. It was an attack against \u201cthe hooligans, who put on the mask of anarchism in order to destroy the order and life and labour of the working class.\u201d Yet \u201csome fifteen anarchists demonstratively left the hall\u201d creating a frightening scene, breaking solidarity and order. ^[10]\n\nAnd before long the anarchists would resort \u201conce more to their terrorist ways.\u201d According to Avrich: \u201cAnarchists in Rostov, Ekaterinoslav and Briansk broke into city jails and liberated the prisoners\u201d in the middle of a civil war. \u201c[I]n the summer of 1918, Black Guardsmen who had survived the Cheka raids of the preceding months, contemplated the armed seizure of the capital but Aleksei Borovoi and Daniil Novomirskii talked them out of it.\u201d ^[11] But according to the historian Marcel Liebman \u2014 evidently against the wishes of Borovoi and Novomirskii \u2014 some anarchists were involved in the Left SR revolt in Moscow on the 6th and 7th of July, which was of course an \u201carmed seizure of the capital\u201d that was quickly crushed. ^[12]\n\n&gt;\u201cLev Chernyi, secretary of the Moscow Federation of Anarchists\u2026 joined an organization called the Underground Anarchists, founded by Kazimir Kovalevich, a member of the Moscow Union of Railway Workers, and a Ukrainian anarchist named Petr Sobolev. Though based in the capital, the Underground Anarchists established ties with the battle detachments of the south\u2026 On the 25th of September [1919 \u2013 MM], together with a number of Left SR\u2019s, they bombed the headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party in Leontiev Street, while a plenary meeting was in session. The explosion killed 12 members of the Committee and wounded 55 others, including Nikolai Bukharin, the eminent Bolshevik theorist and editor of Pravda\u2026\u201d ^[13]\n\nBut even while chaos ensued on the streets of Moscow \u2014 terrorism conducted under the flag of anarchism \u2014 the Bolsheviks tried their best to meet the \u201chonest\u201d anarchists halfway:\n\n&gt;\u201cWhen Kamenev in 1920 offered the Moscow Anarchists freedom to issue their papers and to run their clubs and bookshops in exchange for their adoption of party discipline and a purge of the criminal and irresponsible elements which had infiltrated into their membership, they indignantly rejected the offer.\u201d ^[14]\n\nIt\u2019s clear then from the information I\u2019ve provided that contrary to anarchist mythology the Bolsheviks did not \u201ccrush\u201d the anarchists in Soviet Russia for ideological reasons. The Bolsheviks \u2013 alongside the anarchists who peacefully collaborated with them \u2013 appealed to sincere anarchists involved in dubious activity to distance themselves from the hooligans who had infiltrated their ranks. The \u201canarchists\u201d who were subdued had been looting, burgling, engaging in violent and destructive acts and assassinating government figures. The \u201crepression\u201d of these explicitly anti-soviet and counter-revolutionary terrorists should be seen as nothing more than an overdue retaliation to criminal provocation.\n\n*****\n\n**The Makhnovite Plunders And Pogroms**\n\n&gt;\u201cMakhnovism is one-tenth idealism and nine-tenths plundering and violence.\u201d ^[15]\n\n&gt;\u2013 LEON TROTSKY (BUILDING THE RED ARMED FORCES).\n\nThe Cheka\u2019s raids on the anarchist centres in 1918 caused a number of anti-soviet anarchists to travel to the Ukraine \u2013 where Nestor Makhno (according to anarchist mythology) had established an \u201canarchist\u201d stronghold. But in truth most of the Makhnovist fighters were peasant small-holders who couldn\u2019t have cared less about anarchism. ^[16] \u201cThe handful of agricultural communes established in the Gulyai-Pole region encompassed only a small fraction of its followers. The overwhelming majority of Makhno\u2019s partisans were committed to their own private property.\u201d ^[17]\n\nThe Makhnovists were one of several guerrilla bands that had allied with the Bolsheviks and became units of the Ukrainian Soviet Army in 1919. \u201cMakhno\u2019s forces were assigned a strategically vital section of the Red Army\u2019s Southern Front facing the counter-revolutionary White Army of the former Tsarist general Denikin.\u201d ^[18] But even during his time as a commander of the Ukrainian Soviet Army, Makhno deliberately stole from and undermined his Bolshevik allies. The historian Arthur Adams writes that \u201cMakhno supplied himself, sometimes by commandeering entire Bolshevik supply trains meant for the Southern Front... Soviet food collectors and political institutions found it impossible to function in the region under his domination.\u201d ^[19]\n\nThe Makhnovists demanded that the Bolshevik government supply them with munitions to use in the fight against the Whites. But the Makhnovists also refused to allow Soviet grain collectors into region under their control. The Makhnovists had therefore sought economic assistance from the Bolsheviks but refused to return the favour; often resulting in violent clashes between the Makhnovist guerrillas and Soviet grain collectors. \n\nTrotsky (Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs) wrote that \u201c[S]ince the Makhnovists are sitting on the railway branch-line from Mariupol, they are refusing to allow the coal and grain to leave except in exchange for other supplies... [T]he Makhnovites are trying to establish domination by gangs and bands: whoever has grabbed something is its rightful owner, and can then exchange it for whatever he hasn\u2019t got. This is not products-exchange but commodity-stealing.\u201d ^[20]\n\nOn May 7th 1919 another Ukrainian guerrilla leader named Grigorev \u2013 who like Makhno had collaborated with the Bolsheviks \u2013 mutinied against the Red Army\u2019s command. Grigorev declared that the Bolsheviks were his new main target and called for an anti-Bolshevik alliance that included the White Guards. The Whites\u2019 anti-semitism was no issue for Grigorev \u2013 he himself was a pogromist. According to the Encyclopedia Judaica, Grigorev was responsible for pogroms in 40 communities and the deaths of an estimated 6,000 Jews during the summer of 1919. ^[21]\n\nMakhno \u2013 while initially remaining neutral towards Grigorev\u2019s revolt \u2013 also took action against the Bolsheviks. On May 29th Makhno retreated behind the frontlines, abandoning his command and collaboration with the Reds. The historian Michael Palij writes that \u201cAs soon as Makhno left the front he and his associates began to organise new partisan detachments in the Bolsheviks\u2019 rear, which subsequently attacked strongholds, troops, police, trains and food collectors.\u201d ^[22]  \n\nIn July, Makhno and Grigorev entered a short-lived alliance that didn\u2019t end well for the latter. Though I won't go into that now because I'll be talking about it in more detail later. But the combined force of the Makhnovists, Grigorevites and other guerrilla detachments attacking the Bolsheviks at the same time greatly weakened the strength of the Red Army, playing a major role in the collapse of the Southern Front and allowing Denikin\u2019s White Guards to seize most of Ukraine by the fall of 1919.\n\nAfter Denikin\u2019s defeat in 1920 Makhno was still fighting against the Reds but he later offered to enter a joint alliance against Denikin\u2019s new successor \u2013 the White general Wrangel. Concerned about whether or not Makhno could be trusted given his past betrayals, the Bolsheviks demanded Makhno to purge his ranks of bandits and incorporate his forces into the Red Army. Trotsky \u2013 addressing this new Makhnovist/Bolshevik alliance \u2013 wrote on October 10th 1920:\n\n&gt;\u201cWe, of course, can only welcome the fact that the Makhnovites wish henceforth not to fight against us but with us, against Wrangel. But our pact with the Makhnovites must certainly not be temporary in character. The working class of the Ukraine can never, and especially not in conditions of tremendous military danger, allow particular units sometimes to fight in our ranks and sometimes stab us in the back.\u201d ^[23]\n\nThe Bolsheviks were looking for a stable and continued alliance with Makhno \u2013 not one that would break down and falter the minute their common foe was defeated. But in Makhno\u2019s view this alliance was to be nothing more than a short-term convenience \u2013 and for this reason he refused to recognise the Red Army\u2019s regulations.\n\nAfter Wrangel\u2019s defeat the Makhnovists tried to establish themselves as an autonomous fighting force in Crimea. Had the Makhnovists been successful the Bolsheviks would have lost vital infrastructure and the Ukraine would have become a magnet for enemies of the Bolshevik government. Knowing Makhno\u2019s hostile track record \u2013 not to mention his willingness to enter alliances with dubious anti-Bolshevik forces like Grigorev \u2013 the Bolsheviks viewed this as the final straw. The Bolsheviks therefore moved to end the Makhnovist movement once and for all and succeeded in doing so.\n\nLibertarian mythologists like to argue that the Bolsheviks \u201ccrushed\u201d the Makhnovists because of their formal anarchist convictions. Of course \u2013 as I\u2019ve shown \u2013 this is not the case. It was the Makhnovists\u2019 hostile actions that fermented their demise. Their ideology \u2013 though mistaken and utopian \u2013 was totally irrelevant. \n\nFinally, I\u2019d like to touch on the connection between the Makhnovists and anti-semitic pogroms. While the anarchists are correct to argue that Makhno himself was not an anti-semite, this statement says absolutely nothing about the actions of the Makhnovist fighters on the ground. Numerous eyewitness accounts of anti-semitic pogroms conducted by the Makhnovist guerrillas have been compiled by the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research. ^[24] I\u2019ve yet to find a single anarchist that has scrutinised the reliability of this seemingly damning evidence. But regardless it\u2019s an incontestable fact that the Makhnovists had pogromists among their ranks.\n\nHow so? Because as I alluded to earlier, Makhno and Grigorev entered a short-lived alliance against the Bolsheviks in 1919. But Grigorev\u2019s willingness to co-operate with any and all anti-Bolshevik forces including Denikin conflicted sharply with Makhno\u2019s anarchist convictions. Furthermore, Grigorev\u2019s track record of military opportunism and unpredictability meant that Makhno didn't trust him. This alliance broke down within less than a month, resulting in the death of Grigorev at the hand of Makhno and the absorption of Grigorev\u2019s partisans into Makhno\u2019s army.\nThe following is an eyewitness account from the anarchist Arishnov:\n\n&gt;\u201cJuly 27, 1919, in the village of Sentovo, near Aleksandriya, in Kherson guberniya, on the initiative of Makhno there was an assembly of the rebels of Ekaterinoslav, Kherson, and Taurida. In agreement with the agenda, the session had to decide upon the task of all rebels of the Ukraine relating to the current situation. The assembled mass of peasants, the rebel sections of Grigorev, and the units of Makhno came to about 20,000 people. Grigorev and Makhno and a series of other supporters of this or that movement were designated as reporters. First came Grigorev. He summoned the peasants and rebels to give all their forces to drive the Bolsheviks out of the country, scorning no allies in this work. Grigorev was not opposed to unification with Denikin for this purpose. Later, when the yoke of Bolshevism had been overturned, the people themselves would decide what should be done.\n\n&gt;This declaration proved fatal for Grigorev. Chubenko and Makhno, speaking immediately after him, showed that the struggle with the Bolsheviks could be revolutionary only if it were carried on in the name of social revolution. Collaboration with the most evil enemies of the people \u2013 with the generals \u2013 would be criminal adventure and counter-revolution. \u201cGrigorev calls [us] to this counter-revolution; consequently, he is the enemy of the people.\u201d Then Makhno publicly, before all the assembly, demanded that Grigorev immediately pay for the monstrous pogrom perpertrated by him in May 1919, at Elisavetgrad, and for a series of other anti-semitic actions.\n\n&gt;\u201cSuch blackguards as Grigorev degrade all the rebels of Ukraine, and for them there can be no place in the ranks of the honourable workers of the revolution.\u201d Thus Makhno concluded his accusation of Grigorev. The latter saw that the affair was taking a terrible end for him. He reached for his gun. But he was too late. Simon Karetnik \u2013 the closest assistant of Makhno \u2013 drove him to the ground with several bullets from his Colt, and Makhno, triumphantly proclaiming \u201cDeath to the Ataman!\u201d shot him dead. The friends and members of Grigorev\u2019s staff would have rushed to help him, but were shot on the spot by a group of Makhno\u2019s men previously designated for the task. All this occurred within the course of two or three minutes before the eyes of the assembly\u2026\n\n&gt;**According to the protocol decreed by the assembly, the Makhnovtsy took upon themselves the responsibility for the deed and its consequences. All the partisan sections that had been under the direction of Grigorev, in agreement with the resolution of the assembly were absorbed into the general army of the Makhnovist rebels.\u201d**\n\nRegardless of Makhno\u2019s noble reasons for killing Grigorev the fact remains that Makhno and his colleagues knowingly recruited en masse into their ranks Grigorev\u2019s men who only a few months before had massacred 3,000 Jews in Elisavetgrad. It is therefore indisputable that Makhno\u2019s army contained anti-semitic pogromists. The evidence from YIVO simply serves to reinforce the charge of anti-semitism among the Makhnovists. \n\n *****\n\n**Endnotes**\n\n*****\n\n**The Soviet Anarchists**\n\n[01]\tHemmer, J.

If China and Mexico were nuked off the planet tomorrow, overseas production would move to India/developing Asia instead and automation would continue at home. Nobody with an ounce of understanding of economics should expect high paying blue collar jobs to be restored by a trade war. Thankfully for Trump, the targets of his propaganda lack that understanding.\n\nThe tariffs themselves are clearly targeted at high tech emerging industries. This article describes the facts objectively: http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/2140185/donald-trumps-us50b-tariffs-target-beijings-made-china-2025-tech-strategy It's not about the cheap stuff sold in Walmart, this is about suppressing China's technological ascendancy.\n\nRegarding the concerns of IP theft and fairness, I present two arguments.

It's not like they were forced at gunpoint to spill their secrets, they chose to take their cash and distribute it to shareholders while knowing exactly what they were losing in exchange. Second, inventions should be freely available so others can build on it.

Some people think that China doesn't care about socialism anymore and is becoming a capitalist economy. I disagree. The USSR's failure showed us that low-tech paths to end stage communism do not work because capitalist societies can leverage better technology to gain a military advantage and destroy communism.

I know this is a year old article, none the less the ruling class is at time afraid that the pandora's box they opened might end up popping in their faces, and the question as been the same for the good 30 years past ... so they think, and wonder ... here some bits on New Hampshire\n\n\"New Hampshire is a tiny state but it boasts the seventh-highest number of millionaires in the US. In the dog days of July and August, affluent Bostonians and New Yorkers retreat to summer homes by its picturesque lakes. But New Hampshire is also filled with people like\u00a0Affliction\u2019s protagonist, Wade Whitehouse, the police officer cum snowplough operator cum handyman struggling with three jobs, trailer-park housing, single parenting and addiction. [\u2026] My husband, a writer who inherited our lake home, employs cleaners, plumbers and tradesmen, some of whose parents worked in the same jobs for his mother. It\u2019s hard not to think of this as a kind of neo-serfdom, given the lack of other options for those without a college degree. Decades ago, the state had a flourishing manufacturing industry but much of that work has since decamped to southern American states, where wages are lower. [\u2026] Our neighbours include financiers, film producers, successful artists and entrepreneurs on the one hand, and retail clerks, handymen and house painters on the other. Several underemployed and debt-ridden graduates serve $6 lattes at the one nice coffee place in the area, where you can also buy $100 handmade leather bags, artisanal chocolate and not much else. Other nearby retail outlets include a dollar store and a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts. Exquisite produce and small-batch cheese can be purchased for handsome sums at the Sunday farmers\u2019 market but the only real grocery store is a half-hour\u2019s drive away. [\u2026] The community where we live is thus segregated \u2014 there are large and gracious properties, rentals and trailer parks. [\u2026] I was greeted by her mother, who had the blackened teeth of a (hopefully former) meth addict. That\u2019s not unusual either. New Hampshire is number two in the nation for opioid-related deaths and number one for fentanyl-related fatalities (a cheaper substance people often use alongside heroin or meth). [\u2026] Sadly, if the president has his way, the policies that have helped create New Hampshire\u2019s bifurcated economy will be rolled out to the rest of the nation. That\u2019s an affliction we will all have to deal with.\"\n\nTo read the full article open an incognito window on your browser, paste 'New Hampshire: a tale of two Americas - Financial Times' on the search engine, and you can bypass the pay wall ...

Why can't African countries simply function as their own nation? With complete control and self-determination over there own resources and then trading with China rather than having their resources directly extracted (like Cuba and Sankara's Burkina Faso)?

Apart from that, I looked at Facebook itself. They recently declared they completed a \"takedown\" of the Internet Research Agency (IRA) of Russia, but the sample ads and posts are just innocuous and Russian nationalist, as [this post shows](https://imgur.com/a/yrw7f). I don't know why anyone should be afraid of such ads and posts when they are basically aimed at Russian speakers. Apart from that:\n\n\n* on April 4, Zuckerberg [declared that](https://imgur.com/a/v9RYS) they can supposedly be trusted to \"protect the integrity of elections around the world\" (isn't that the job of governments, not corporate entities?) and that we should trust there tens of thousands of individuals \"working on security and content review\" ( \"more than 20,000 by the end of this year\"), saying that Facebook's efforts to suppress such content is not over: \"...this is going to be a never-ending battle. You never fully solve security \u2014 it\u2019s an arms race. In retrospect we were behind...We had thousands of people working on security...I am confident we are making progress against these adversaries,\" fully joining the chorus against \"fake news\" and the supposed \"misinformation campaign\" of Russia.\n\n\n* on January 25, Toomas Hendrik Ilves of the Hoover Institution had an article [reposted on Facebook's newsroom](http://archive.is/vUMkY), declaring that \"Russian hackers breached both Republican and Democratic servers but only released information on the Democrats...These are new techniques, at least at this massive level of dissemination...NATO\u2019s Center of Excellence for Strategic Communication...recently reported that an astounding 84% of Russian-language Twitter messages about NATO\u2019s presence in Eastern Europe were generated by bots...Russian and \u201cAlt-Right\u201d bot accounts have set their sights on a variety of issues. The hashtag #Syriahoax appeared immediately after news of a Syrian chemical gas attack and at one point was retweeted by a single source every five seconds.\" His argument falls flat based on his sources and clearly pro-imperialist, anti-Russia viewpoint, just like [bourgeois viewpoint of Glenn Greenwald](https://russia-insider.com/en/glenn-greenwald-evidence-assad-used-gas-overwhelming-amy-goodman-agrees/ri23031).\n\n\n* on January 22, Cass R. Sunstein, Harvard Law School professor and former Obama appointee, [declared that](http://archive.is/7sAJW) \"...as we have seen, those with specific interests \u2014 including politicians and nations, such as Russia, seeking to disrupt democratic processes \u2014 can use social media to promote those interests.\" What about the U$'s Cuba Twitter program? It seems he has forgotten about imperial efforts like that to meddle in other countries.\n\n\n* on January 22, Samidh Chakrabarti, Product Manager, Civic Engagement, at Facebook [declared that](http://archive.is/AkCvU) \"around the US 2016 election, Russian entities set up and promoted fake Pages on Facebook to influence public sentiment \u2014 essentially using social media as an information weapon...we discovered that these Russian actors created 80,000 posts that reached around 126 million people in the US over a two-year period...It\u2019s abhorrent to us that a nation-state used our platform to wage a cyberwar intended to divide society...The Russian interference worked in part by promoting inauthentic Pages, so we\u2019re working to make politics on Facebook more transparent...we\u2019re committed to this issue of transparency because it goes beyond Russia.\" Again, the idea of how many people these posts is questionable. Saying it \"reached around 126 million people in the US over a two-year period\" is actually vague, as it doesn't say when posts were made. After all, the U$ population is over 300 million, so this isn't even half the U$ population. Also, this number could be faulty because of some individuals interacting with the posts more than others.\n\n\n* On November 22 of last year, [Facebook continued](http://archive.is/BYJFj) its \"ongoing effort to protect our platforms and the people who use them from bad actors who try to undermine our democracy\" by learning \"which of the Internet Research Agency Facebook Pages or Instagram accounts they may have liked or followed between January 2015 and August 2017\" since they declare that people should \"understand how foreign actors tried to sow division and mistrust using Facebook before and after the 2016 US election.\" Perhaps instead of this, they should highlight imperialist and capitalist propaganda outlets that people \"like\" or \"follow.\" But, they won't do this, of course, as they are reinvested in such Russophobia.\n\n\n* On October 2 of last year, Joel Kaplan, VP Global Public Policy of Facebook, [declared that](http://archive.is/sHuTB) they would share \"the ads that appear to have come from a Russian entity known as the Internet Research Agency. We found more than 3,000 of these ads, which ran between 2015 and 2017. Many appear to amplify racial and social divisions...We are sharing these ads with Congress because we want to do our part to help investigators gain a deeper understanding of Russian interference in the US political system and explain those activities to the public.\" That doesn't seem like many ads at all. Additionally, social and racial divisions are already amplified. How could a paltry number of ads magically make it worse?\n\n\n* On October 2 of last year, Elliot Schrage, Vice President of Policy and Communications of Facebook, [talked about](http://archive.is/tceHM) the ads paid for by Russian individuals, saying that \"most of the ads appear to focus on divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum, touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights. A number of them appear to encourage people to follow Pages on these issues...An estimated 10 million people in the US saw the ads...44% of total ad impressions...were before the US election on November 8, 2016; 56% were after the election...Roughly 25% of the ads were never shown to anyone...Of the more than 3,000 ads that we have shared with Congress, 5% appeared on Instagram. About $6,700 was spent on these ads.\" He also added that \"Some of the ads were paid for in Russian currency. Currency alone isn\u2019t a good way of identifying suspicious activity, because the overwhelming majority of advertisers who pay in Russian currency, like the overwhelming majority of people who access Facebook from Russia, aren\u2019t doing anything wrong...If Americans conducted a coordinated, inauthentic operation \u2014 as the Russian organization did in this case \u2014 we would take their ads down, too. However, many of these ads did not violate our content policies. That means that for most of them, if they had been run by authentic individuals, anywhere, they could have remained on the platform.\" This doesn't really amount to much at all, showing the Russophobia trumpeted by the media is clearly overblown.\n\n\n* On [September 21 of last year](http://archive.is/AJ3UN), Colin Stretch, General Counsel of Facebook declared that they found \"more than 3,000 ads addressing social and political issues that ran in the US between 2015 and 2017 and that appear to have come from accounts associated with a Russian entity known as the Internet Research Agency. We subsequently made clear that we are providing information related to those ads, including the ad content itself, to the Special Counsel investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US election...This has been a difficult decision. Disclosing content is not something we do lightly under any circumstances...we have reached out to congressional leadership to agree on a process and schedule to provide the content of these ads, along with related information, to congressional investigators. At the same time, we will continue our own review and investigation, and to do our part to make sure investigators have the information they need. We look forward to their comprehensive assessment, and to a greater public understanding of what took place.\" Basically, this is an utter endorsement of Russophobia, but it is so bland as to be worthless. It does say, however, that Facebook is effectively, in a sense, siding against the orange menace and allying itself with the military and intelligence establishments.\n\n\n* On September 21 of last year, Elliot Schrage, Vice President of Policy and Communications of Facebook, [said that](http://archive.is/tceHM) \"in some situations, Facebook employees work directly with our larger advertisers. In the case of the Russian ads, none of those we found involved in-person relationships...there was nothing necessarily noteworthy at the time about a foreign actor running an ad involving a social issue. Of course, knowing what we\u2019ve learned since the election, some of these ads were indeed both noteworthy and problematic, which is why our CEO today announced a number of important steps we are taking to help prevent this kind of deceptive interference in the future...It\u2019s possible that government investigators have information that could help us, and we welcome any information the authorities are willing to share to help with our own investigations...In contrast, the approximately 470 accounts and Pages we shut down recently were identified by our dedicated security team that manually investigates specific, organized threats. They found that this set of accounts and Pages were affiliated with one another \u2014 and were likely operated out of Russia.\" This shows that Facebook is not only willing to work with the U$ government to promote Russophobia, but they implicitly admit that there wasn't much influence and only some of the ads were \"noteworthy and problematic\" while others weren't!\n\n\n* On September 6, Facebook [declared](http://archive.is/tateG) it had information on \"information operations.\" They noted that \"one question that has emerged is whether there\u2019s a connection between the Russian efforts and ads purchased on Facebook. These are serious claims and we\u2019ve been reviewing a range of activity on our platform to help understand what happened,\" declaring that \"we have found approximately $100,000 in ad spending from June of 2015 to May of 2017 \u2014 associated with roughly 3,000 ads \u2014 that was connected to about 470 inauthentic accounts and Pages in violation of our policies. Our analysis suggests these accounts and Pages were affiliated with one another and likely operated out of Russia.\" Already, this seems like a small drop in the bucket, not enough to turn an  election. But what did they target? Well, Facebook claims that \"the vast majority of ads run by these accounts didn\u2019t specifically reference the US presidential election, voting or a particular candidate...the ads and accounts appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum \u2014 touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights. About one-quarter of these ads were geographically targeted, and of those, more ran in 2015 than 2016. The behavior displayed by these accounts...was consistent with the techniques...[of] information operations.\" Again, this seems to be disparate, but is worth noting that they \"shared our findings with US authorities investigating these issues, and we will continue to work with them as necessary,\" showing that they are fine with state-sanctioned Russophobia.\n\nThe Russophobia goes back further than that. In 2014, Facebook [took down posts](http://archive.is/QNqt5) from those in Russia and Ukraine who used \"slang words,\" which was \"initially unpopular on both sides because it seemed restrictive, but in the context of the conflict felt important to us.\" In [2013](http://archive.is/dLKcr), Russia made one request for data and no data was produced by Facebook, while with the U$, for 79% of the requests some data was produced, with this being the case for 68% of UK requests, and 50% of requests by the Zionist state. Still, Facebook wasn't opposed to partnership or investment (it likely would be now): there was a partnership between \"Yandex, Russia\u2019s largest search engine\" and Facebook in [October 2010](http://archive.is/jqf7T) and investment by a company which invests in Eastern Europe and Russia in [May 2009](http://archive.is/mye9Y), with high posting on the Sochi Olympics in Russia [in 2014](http://archive.is/QbYln).\n\nAdditionally, between [July 2016](http://archive.is/vauQM) and [June 2017](http://archive.is/E9T5J), Facebook didn't produce any data for the 19 data requests by Russia, mostly related to the legal process. The same was the case between [July 2014](http://archive.is/lU1ya) and [December 2015](http://archive.is/qG7JE), when the Russian state [made](http://archive.is/plJEB) 7 data requests. It also occurred between [January 2013](http://archive.is/4kf90) and [December 2013](http://archive.is/X4h5Q) when the Russian state made 2 data requests. Compare this to the [most recent report on the Zionist state](http://archive.is/aIH1N): in about 77% of cases, some data was produced!\n\nIn closing this post, I would say it perfectly fine to criticize Russia since is undoubtedly a capitalist state while recognizing its role in the world today, assisting certain progressive countries (like Juche Korea and Cuba, to give two examples). But pointing out such Russophobia is important as it shows how social networks like Facebook serve the centers of power and the aims of the global capitalist class.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Blatant Russophobia of Facebook: a worrisome development"}

It's just an observation on my discovery. Also, I'm not 100% sure if this is the right place to post this, so if it isn't allowed that's fine.)\n\nBecause I used to be Christian and I am an atheist now, I have thought a lot about my criticisms. In thinking about the tenants of the Jehovah's Witness ideology in specific, I realized that their concept of the new system of things is kinda Communist.\n\nIt's quite interesting in all honesty. In the belief system of the Jehovah's Witnesses (of which I know the most about, though fuzzily since it's been a while), there are a few basic groups of people that go certain places after Armageddon and when the New System of Things is instituted: the 144,000 that will go to heaven, the people who die faithful to God, the people who die without being faithful to God, and basically the ones that God hasn't forgiven. It's been a while since I've been in a Kingdom Hall, so forgive me if I've gotten anything wrong!\n\nThe group of people who die faithful to God but aren't the 144,000 are given paradise on Earth. This is where I noticed Communism. I remember reading The Watchtower (an important Jehovah's Witness publication) and it said something like that there would be no scarcity there. Is that not the end-goal of Communism? Sure, it's couched in Christianity and I'm not really sure how modern Christianity works with Communism, but the end goals can co-operate.\n\nWhat do you think? I found this a very interesting observation, and I'd like to hear what other people say!","subreddit":"communism","title":"I discovered that Christian Communism is a thing"}

We (as humans) have molded a new system from scratch to the wonderful Cuban democracy that we have today!\n\nOn October 1917, the means of production in Russia were seized and for 73 years the USSR triumphed! Although there were some mistakes which lead to its dissolution, it was the first socialist superpower which ever existed!

Trading and speculation on money itself, where the national currency is bought and sold with a view towards quick turnovers, and rises and falls not in the production for which that currency stands, but rather in what the market will offer for it in just such trading. This is clearly a speculation which can have devastating results for whole populations, whose living standards now depend, in globalization, on the capacity of the local currency in which their wages are paid to buy necessities which are now largely imported. Behind this, currency speculation has disastrous effects on the Debt, into which all these countries have been plunged by the IMF and other international institutions.\"\n\nDo you think he is right about surplus not coming anymore from production? Does this means that LTV altough is not refuted it is outdated for today's financial stage of capitalism?\n\nOther quotes from the article that i found interesting:\n\n\"My point here is that the money thus speculated on has itself been abstracted and sublimated into the counters and tokens of a higher kind of trading and speculative money which is little more than numbers or figures on a stock market board. Just as physical value, once weighed in gold, was replaced by paper substitutes, so now those physical substitutes, whether paper or not, are replaced by sheer numbers and empty ciphers on a computer, numbers which have no physical substance at all, and very little stability in terms of fixed value.\"\n\n\"&lt;i&gt;Gibson signs a copy of &lt;/i&gt;Zero History (2010). Photograph by Nikki Tysoe / Flickr\n\nWe have had to wait for a remarkable book by Giovanni Arrighi, The Long Twentieth Century, for a brand-new theory of finance capitalism which completely rewrites our picture of the stages of capitalism itself. Arrighi begins with a remark of the great world historian Fernand Braudel: \u201cEvery capitalist development of this order seems, by reaching the stage of financial expansion, to have in some sense announced its maturity: it is a sign of autumn.\u201d3 The yellow leaves of capitalism are apparent when a specific market has been saturated: production slows down, there is no longer any burning need for refrigerators, automobiles, personal computers, there is no expansion possible in the area of production in general; and at that point financial speculation must begin and profits be made in this higher-level or more abstract fashion, capitalism now as it were profiting from itself and speculating on itself, feeding on itself, by way of the stock market and its allied institutions. Arrighi\u2019s insight in fact proposes a three-stage theory of evolution, first a specific market is opened and colonized; then the great moment of production saturates it; and finally, in some third autumnal stage, finance capital sets in and takes over a stagnating economy.\"\n\nDo you think Jameson is correct on his theory or is exxageration to claim that labour no longer determines value neither is the source for surplues value?\n\nlink: http://www.publicbooks.org/a-global-neuromancer/\n\nthanks for your time","subreddit":"communism","title":"A question about the stages of capitalism and LTV"}

I am looking for a digital version of a book 'Red '48ers: Marx and Engles' by Oscar J Hammen. I've scanned a book about Shanghai Commune and posted link to it on this subreddit, so I think that asking for a favor of this kind - scanning of an entire book - fits within limits of what one may call reciprocity. Still, I am well aware of the fact, that asking anonymous mass of reddit users to scan a book is rather unusual way to get a hold of it. If anything, it only shows you how desperate I am. Living in Eastern Europe, I can say that access to any valuable literature on Marx is limited; without internet I'd probably still be living in a revolutionary middle ages, by that I mean not knowing a thing about Maoism, The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Gonzalo, etc.\n\nSecondly, I'd like to incite a discussion about the relevance of the upheavals that took place in the year 1848 and the disillusionment that followed. Looking at it from the perspective of 170 years, I'd be inclined to say that we - the international community of Communists - can learn a lot from the situation that Marx and Engels had to face: at that time the only international communist organization was disbanded - by Marx himself; the counterrevolutionary forces were on the rise; the intensity of class war was unprecedented; so was the impotency of revolutionary agents; the need to recreate, reinvent communism was urgent. \nI think we should oppose the cult of '68 - which is being fetishised by the 'international left' -  and turn our attention to the year 1848 and the hopelessness that prevailed and the courage with which it was met by the future fathers of Communism.  \n\n\n  ","subreddit":"communism","title":"Red '48ers: Marx and Engels/ '68 vs '1848"}

I read one study that found that defendants who were seen as unattractive were more likely to be found guilty than those who were attractive. (On mobile can't link) Also you guys may remember a guy from California who had committed a crime had his mug shots go viral due to his attractiveness and he obtained modeling contracts due to these mug shots. Criminals are not usually treated this way.\n\nNow obviously this is harmful to society if people who are seen as unattractive are not treated as well as other based upon this alone. However I believe that this issue can be overcome if we analyze what causes it.\n\nOne I believe that capitalism, even if it's not entirely responsible, makes the problem worse. The entire spiel of \"sex sells\" causes people seen as more attractive to be prioritized for jobs (just look at hooters) among other things. Women have been more victims of this but guys can be victims as well.\n\nUnder a socialist society, a successful cultural revolution would hopefully cause us to be mindful of how we treat people and why we treat them the way that we do, and change that accordingly. I don't think that this has happened yet, for example I know in Cuba women are constantly cat-called among other things.\n\nWhat do you guys think?","subreddit":"communism","title":"Objectification of human beings &amp; capitalism"}
