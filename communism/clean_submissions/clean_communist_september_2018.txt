{"author":"TheCarlyleanHero","created_utc":1535913558,"num_comments":8,"score":1,"selftext":"Lenin and Trotsky both explained how Russia, despite being the most backward of the major capitalist countries, could launch a successful proletarian revolution before the advanced countries in Europe - and in 1917, this did indeed happen. There is an explanation for this when we look at it from a dialectical point of view. As Trotsky explained, Russia's very backwardness created the material conditions that allowed for the Russian proletariat to seize power before the proletariat in the West, as the bourgeoisie (the class meant to develop capitalism) was too weak and small to play a progressive role, and too tied to the interests of the landlords and the autocracy, as well as foreign capital, to have any interest in promoting democracy or an independent, national form of capitalism. Furthermore, the fact that Russia was forced to rely on ideas and technology imported ready-made from the West meant that it could expend all of the effort that would otherwise have been spent on organically developing capitalism on simply improving the ideas and technique imported from the West. With the newest innovations and technology came the newest political ideas - i.e. Marxism - which found an audience among the small but militant proletariat. Because it developed so quickly it did not have time to be corrupted by right-wing liberal reformists in the trade unions like, say, the British proletariat.\n\nHowever, I am yet to come across a complete dialectical explanation for why America, the most advanced capitalist country, despite its advanced nature, is also the most conservative, the most backward, the most regressive concerning the sphere of political ideology and religion (which is, of course, a form of ideology). It has never developed a mass workers' party, with both political parties being dominated by the interests of Capital. Most people believe in some sort of deity, and, until recently, most were also regular church-goers. Megachurches filled with thousands and thousands of people are headed by self-proclaimed \"men of God\" that try to mix religion with business and justify the selfish and materialistic nature of capitalism with reference to the Bible. Significant minorities hold openly racist views, and at least one of the two major parties is filled with openly racist or fanatically religious politicians holding office.\n\nI will try and answer my own question, based on my own understanding of Marxism and American history. America, having been for much of its history the most prosperous capitalist nation, has never felt the need for large-scale socio-economic reform of the kind that European countries were forced to undergo to appease the increasingly militant proletariat. In the last chapter of Capital, Marx talks about how America was so vast that the colonists were able to have their own small plots of land. In this situation, there was no development of a large proletarian class for many decades - indeed, the colonial authorities had to artificially create one in order to allow for the development of capitalism. Only the Civil War allowed for full-scale proletarianisation to take place in America, once the backward Southern agrarian bourgeoisie which relied on slave labour had been defeated. Even then, for much of the nineteenth-century, U.S. workers were relatively prosperous thanks to deflation and the fact that the increasingly prosperous American capitalists, thanks to their increasingly large profits, could afford concessions through increasing real wages. It was really only during the Great Depression that the working-class of America became restive to the point of nearly adopting communism and forming an independent workers' party, but the victory of America in WWII and the destruction of the other capitalist economies thanks to the carnage of war allowed for years of boom, during which working-class Americans enjoyed unheard of prosperity.\n\nThe American people long deluded themselves that their prosperity was not thanks to their unique set of material conditions - being a large country with a large population and lots of natural resources - but because of their cultural superiority. America, more than any other nation, is saturated with bourgeois ideology. \"Rugged individualism\" and the entrepreneurial spirit are given credit for America's prosperity. Anglo-American liberalism and the Protestant work ethic are seen as key to understanding America's position as the wealthiest capitalist nation in the world. America is still the most religious nation in the Western Hemisphere. A country which has sent a man to the moon, produced the most marvellous feats of science and technology, has developed wonders greater than the pyramids of Egypt, is still populated by millions and millions of people who believe in the myths of the Old Testament, in UFOs and the moral evils of abortion. The American people are the most ignorant, uneducated, close-minded, conservative and reactionary-minded people in the entire capitalist world. I do not say this to insult them, but as a matter of objective fact.\n\nSince the 1970s and the introduction of neoliberal economics of course, the lot of working-class Americans has collapsed dramatically, and inequality has never been higher. Just as in the years of the Great Depression, millions of working-class people have lost all illusions in the capitalist system. The prosperity of the 50s and 60s is not coming back, ever. American capitalism is permanently broken. Another New Deal is out of the question - the capitalist class simply cannot afford it. Obama's piecemeal reforms have resulted in nothing good for the American working-class.\n\nYoung, working-class Americans are leaving the church, rejecting the superstitions and backward views of their parents and grandparents. They are becoming increasingly left-wing. The working-class is more militant and more left-leaning than ever before in American history. Bourgeois ideology is losing its power. Never before has the hold of religion been weaker - every other year some Charismatic preacher gets hit by scandal. Snake-oil salesmen like Joel Osteen and Creflo Dollar - which have made a fortune from combining apologia for neoliberalism with Christian teaching - the so-called \"prosperity gospel\" - are being shown up as frauds, conmen and scum.\n\nSo, that's my explanation for why America is still so backward in some aspects and yet so progressive and advanced in others. There is hope yet, though.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Why is America the most advanced capitalist country yet also the most religious?"}

He had left his native Blagoveshchensk for the city of Harbin where he decided to join the local law society and went under the tutelage of other Russian emigres, especially one Professor N.I. Nikiforov. \n\n[With Nikiforov as his prefector, Rodzaevsky formed the Russian Fascist Organisation](https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/259654)\n\nSix years later, he became the Secretary General of the newly formed Russian Fascist Party, adopting a yellow bannered Swastika as its symbol. Yellow bannered in honour of his associates, who were members of the Imperial army of the Russian empire and then soldiers in the anti-Communist white army.\n\nHe translated many fascist German texts into Russian in a bid to try and unify the two groups, Nazi Germany and fascist Russia, against Communist Russia. Hilariously, one of the v\u00f6lkisch tracts not translated into Russian was Mein Kampf, mostly because Hitler repeatedly referred to Russians as 'untermensch' and the fact that his statements that Germany's lebensraum was to be found in the Soviet Union presented problems for the Russian Fascists. Rodzaevsky wrote to Hitler, asking him to amend Mein Kampf, and upon receiving no reply, finally did translate Mein Kampf into Russian in 1936 with the offending passages removed\n\nModeling themselves on the Italian Blackshirts, Rodzaevsky's fascists also wore black attire and were armed by the Japanese Imperial Army, to act as a minor buffer against the Soviet Union.\n\nHe served in the [Asano Detachment](http:\/\/www.chinaww2.com\/2016\/09\/27\/russians-in-the-service-of-the-japanese-emperor\/),  a group most infamous for carrying out acts of sabotage against the Soviet Union, as they were too small and weak to carry out any high file acts of war. \n\nThey created links to multiple blanket organisations around the world, one of the most prominent being in New York City. One prominent contact was the Russian Fascist [Anastasy Vonsiatsky](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anastasy_Vonsiatsky), who was arrested by the FBI for pro-nazi activities, but was unsurprisingly released earlier and died a naturalised US citizen.\n\nVonsiatsky made a very interesting statement: [\"The Russian National Revolutionary Party, of which I am the leader, does not support either Germany's or Japan's ambition for hegemony in Europe or the Far East. The Germans and the Japanese have never made clear their attitude toward a replacement of the present Stalinist rule by a Russian National Government. The sole aim of our organization is to return Russia to a free people with a government elected by the people, of the people and for the people. Our intention is to form in Russia a truly DEMOCRATIC government. Our Party is not anti-Semitic. Our Party has no membership dues; it is financed solely by voluntary contributions from its members and sympathizers. It is not subsidized by any FOREIGN POWER or foreign individuals. Our organization is BANNED in Germany and Japan. Only in the United States can we enjoy freedom of action and thought within the laws of the country. I HEREWITH STATE EMPHATICALLY THAT THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR ORGANIZATION ARE AGAINST THE PRESENT SOVIET GOVERNMENT ALONE AND THAT IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER DOES IT ACT AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OR VIOLATE ITS LAWS WHICH WE LOYALLY SUPPORT.\"](https:\/\/books.google.ie\/books?id=eZ91V_t8sksC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102&amp;dq=The+Russian+National+Revolutionary+Party,+of+which+I+am+the+leader,+does+not+support+either+Germany%27s+or+Japan%27s+ambition+for+hegemony+in+Europe+or+the+Far+East.+The+Germans+and+the+Japanese+have+never+made+clear+their+attitude+toward+a+replacement+of+the+present+Stalinist+rule+by+a+Russian+National+Government.+The+sole+aim+of+our+organization+is+to+return+Russia+to+a+free+people+with+a+government+elected+by+the+people,+of+the+people+and+for+the+people.+Our+intention+is+to+form+in+Russia+a+truly+DEMOCRATIC+government.+Our+Party+is+not+anti-Semitic.+Our+Party+has+no+membership+dues;+it+is+financed+solely+by+voluntary+contributions+from+its+members+and+sympathizers.+It+is+not+subsidized+by+any+FOREIGN+POWER+or+foreign+individuals.+Our+organization+is+BANNED+in+Germany+and+Japan.+Only+in+the+United+States+can+we+enjoy+freedom+of+action+and+thought+within+the+laws+of+the+country.+I+HEREWITH+STATE+EMPHATICALLY+THAT+THE+ACTIVITIES+OF+OUR+ORGANIZATION+ARE+AGAINST+THE+PRESENT+SOVIET+GOVERNMENT+ALONE+AND+THAT+IN+NO+WAY+WHATSOEVER+DOES+IT+ACT+AGAINST+THE+CONSTITUTION+OF+THE+UNITED+STATES+OR+VIOLATE+ITS+LAWS+WHICH+WE+LOYALLY+SUPPORT.+ANASTASE+A.+VONSIATSKY.+Thompson,+Conn.+July+4,+1940&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n6XqjLFuC4&amp;sig=TVZZh-2aDv_RIsniVJ9wKfBgXKI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwid28Pj2J_dAhVlAsAKHW2GAzMQ6AEwAHoECAsQAQ)\n\nRodzaevsky and his fascist followers attended the anniversary of the founding of the Japanese empire and honoured Emperor Hirohito with praise for his anti-Soviet efforts.\n\nHirohito's forces used the Russian Fascists to [kidnap 'disloyal' White army Russians for use in experiments in Japan's infamous unit 731](https:\/\/books.google.co.uk\/books?id=t8sdihXN47wC&amp;pg=PA305)\n\nRodzaevsky installed a [giant flashing neon swastika at the Russian club in Manzhouli](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/9\/9a\/RFP_Manchouli_Swastica.jpg), just three kilometres from the Soviet Border, in a bid to rub into the faces of the Soviet leadership that they had yet to catch him and that they had fascists on another of their doorsteps. \n\nThe German Reich Ministry of War's physchological warfare lab created pamphlets urging Red army soldiers to overthrow the \"Jew Commissars\", the pamphlets were supposed to [be spread by the Russian Fascist Party](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War_crimes_of_the_Wehrmacht)\n\n\nNotoriously anti-semitic, Rodzaevsky published numerous pamphlets calling for the destruction of Jews wholesale and wrote extensively in his party paper \"Nash Put\" on 'The Jewish Problem'\n\nRodzaevsky demanded the Japanese assist him in his attempt to overthrow the Bolsheviks, but they relegated him to sabotage acts.\n\nTowards the end of the war, Comrade Soldiers of the Worker's and Peasant's Red Army advanced on his position. Like the coward he was, Rodzaevsky adopted National Bolshevism in a desperate bid to save his life, praising Stalin as \"The unknown leader\" he had envisioned who was [\"capable of overturning the Jewish government and creating a new Russia...by the will of fate, of his own genius, and of millions of toilers, Comrade J.V. Stalin, the leader of the peoples\"](https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/259654?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)\n\nThe Soviets promised him freedom and a job in one of the newspapers, and Rodzaevsky eagerly relented. \n\nOnce back in Soviet Russia, the Bolsheviks immediately captured him and executed him. Whilst imprisoning many of his co-conspirators.\n\nPost his return, other National Bolsheviks like Nikolai Ustrialov returned and were not met with execution, but mistrust due to their past associations. \n\nOn National Bolsheviks as a whole, Lenin [condemned them in his \"On The Intelligentsia\"](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Intelligentsia)","subreddit":"communism","title":"On the Russian Fascist Party of the 1930's and 40's."}

{"author":"MattiaCost","created_utc":1536323998,"num_comments":19,"score":90,"selftext":"Hello, I just came back from an amazing journey in the People's Republic of China, and have visited many cities and places, like Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Tongli, Guilin, etc. etc.\n\nIt was amazing and everything, but while you may be interested in the architectural and natural beauties of this amazing country, this is r\/communism, so I'll write about CPC, SWCC and my knowledge of it based on *studies and* ***talks*** *with Chinese people.* In the end you'll find some interesting pictures about CPC posters, communist things and everything!\n\nI want to write my personal analysis of the Constitution of CPC and the whole system called SWCC. This post just shows what they think, I don't want to tell anyone to believe in this or in that, this is just an explanation with some links.\n\nBefore starting: comrades, if you go to Shanghai, go to visit the site of the first CPC congress, it's AMAZING!\n\n    The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese working class, the Chinese people, and the Chinese nation.\n\nFrom the very beginning of the Constitution, we can understand that CPC is based on the theory of Vanguardism, which is a strategy whereby the most class-conscious and politically advanced sections of the working class, described as the revolutionary vanguard, form organizations in order to draw larger sections of the working class towards revolutionary politics and serve as manifestations of proletarian political power against its class enemies.\n\nThe CPC is based on **Democratic centralism**, which is *a democratic practice in which political decisions reached by voting processes are binding upon all members of the party.* As you know, the whole concept of Democratic centralism can be synthesized in the expression \"freedom of discussion, unity of action\", written by Lenin on the **Report on the Unity Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.** (Link: [https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/lenin\/works\/1906\/rucong\/viii.htm](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/lenin\/works\/1906\/rucong\/viii.htm)).\n\nThe third article of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China (adopted on December 4, 1982) is about Democratic centralism, here's the article:\n\n    The state organs of the People's Republic of China apply the principle of democratic centralism. The National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at different levels are instituted through democratic election. They are responsible to the people and subject to their supervision. All administrative, judicial and procuratorial organs of the state are created by the people's congresses to which they are responsible and under whose supervision they operate. The division of functions and powers between the central and local state organs is guided by the principle of giving full play to the initiative and enthusiasm of the local authorities under the unified leadership of the central authorities.\n\nLet's continue with the Constitution of the CPC:\n\n    It is the leadership core for the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics and represents the developmental demands of China\u2019s advanced productive forces, the orientation for China\u2019s advanced culture, and the fundamental interests of the greatest possible majority of the Chinese people.\n\nHere we can understand two things:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The CPC guides the whole nation. That's not new, Mao Zedong already talked about the role of the Party at the *Talk at the general reception for the delegates to the Third National Congress of the NewDemocratic Youth League of China* (May 25, 1957).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) The CPC developed the concept of Communist Party, by creating the *\"Theory of the Three Represents\",* developed by Jiang Zemin, the third Chinese president.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis theory is divided in three parts:\n\n1. CPC represents advanced social productive forces.\n2. CPC represents the progressive course of China's advanced culture.\n3. CPC represents the fundamental interests of the majority.\n\nThis is the explanation of the first representation:\n\n    The Party's basic nature determines that it must represent the development trend of China's advanced productive forces. Productive forces are the most revolutionary and dynamic factors in social mode of production, and they are the forces that ultimately determine how human society develops. The competition among all the forces in the world today is, in the final analysis, a competition in overall national power, including economic, scientific and technological strength and national cohesiveness. China's productive forces have grown fairly rapidly over the 50 plus years since the People's Republic was founded in 1949, especially over the 20 plus years since the policies of reform and opening up were introduced in the late 1970s. However, their overall level is still much lower than in the developed countries in the West. China must vigorously develop its productive forces and improve its economy so that it can gain greater initiative and a more favorable position in future competition in science and technology and solve its present economic and social problems. All the Party's battles during the 80 plus years since its founding have been waged to emancipate and develop the productive forces. The Party must ground itself on China's realities, conform to the trend of the times, stay focused on economic development, and make developing the productive forces its basic task.\n\nThis is the explanation of the second representation:\n\n    Socialist society means a society that develops and progresses comprehensively. A society is truly socialist only when its economic, political and cultural development is balanced and a good job is done in both material and spiritual civilization. Only by always representing the orientation of China's advanced culture and working hard to develop a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics can the CPC achieve this goal. In present-day China, developing advanced culture means developing a national, scientific, and popular culture that is geared to the needs of modernization, the world and the future. The fundamental task of socialist culture is to educate citizens to have lofty ideals, moral integrity, good education and a strong sense of discipline. We must always take Marxism as our guide, clearly discern the orientation of advanced culture, and resolutely oppose wrong, anti-Marxist ideas. At the same time, we must clearly understand that Marxism is a developing science. It cannot be regarded as a rigid dogma; new experience and understanding gained from practice must be constantly assimilated and used to enrich and develop Marxism.\n\nThis is the explanation of the third representation:\n\n    Ever since our Party was founded, its primary aim has been to serve the people wholeheartedly. Over the past 80 plus years, all our successes in both revolution and development have been attributable mainly to the fact that we represent the interests of the overwhelming majority of the people and are able to unite with them in their struggles for their own interests. In the circumstances of carrying out the reform and opening up and expanding the socialist market economy, our Party must emphasize working for the interests of the people more than ever before. The Party's greatest political strength is that we have maintained close ties with the masses, and the greatest danger since assuming political power has lain in the possibility of being estranged from them. Whether the line, principles and policies the Party formulates conform to the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people must be taken as the highest criterion for judging them, and whether the people are satisfied with and agree with them must be taken as their basis and goal. Our cadres must maintain the work style and the way of thinking of \"from the masses, to the masses\". They must be concerned about the people's hardships, listen to their opinions and protect their interests. Party officials, especially leaders at all levels, must be incorruptible and self-disciplined and share weal and woe with the masses. At all times and under any circumstances, Party officials must follow the Party's mass line, adhere to the objective of serving the people wholeheartedly, and take benefiting the people as the starting and end points of all their work. They must carefully study the new character of mass work in the new situation and integrate strengthening and improving mass work into all their work relating to Party building and consolidating political power. \n\nLet's continue with the analysis:\n\n    The Party\u2019s highest ideal and ultimate goal is the realization of communism.\n\nWell, this is self-explanatory. China is, for CPC members, in the *first phase of socialism*, which is a kind of socialism that needs to develop, in order to arrive to the *advanced phase of socialism*, and then communism.\n\nYou all know that communism isn't something that can be established, just like Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels pointed out in the German Ideology:\n\n    Communism is for us not a state of affairs which is to be established.\n\nCPC has many goals: 2021, 2035-2050.\n\n2021 will be the centenary of the CPC, and by this year the \"war against poverty\" will have to be completed (interesting article about it: [http:\/\/www.xinhuanet.com\/english\/2017-08\/29\/c\\_136566153.htm](http:\/\/www.xinhuanet.com\/english\/2017-08\/29\/c_136566153.htm)).\n\nThe second goal is even more ambitious, I'll quote this article ([https:\/\/qz.com\/1105337\/chinas-19th-party-congress-your-five-minute-summary-of-xi-jinpings-three-hour-speech\/](https:\/\/qz.com\/1105337\/chinas-19th-party-congress-your-five-minute-summary-of-xi-jinpings-three-hour-speech\/)) about the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party:\n\n    [...] the second stage will last from 2035-2050, during which China will become a leading global power and the Chinese people will basically enjoy \u201ccommon property.\u201d By then, Xi said, \u201cthe Chinese nation will stand with a more high-spirited image in the family of nations.\u201d\n\nThe next part of the CPC Constitution is about the body of theories that the Party itself uses as a guide to action:\n\n    The Communist Party of China uses Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng\n    Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, the Scientific Outlook on Development, and Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as its\n    guides to action.\n\nThis is what CPC thinks about Marxism-Leninism:\n\n    Marxism-Leninism reveals the laws governing the development of the history of\n    human society. Its basic tenets are correct and have tremendous vitality.\n\nThe CPC starts from Marxism-Leninism because: *\"If there is to be revolution, there must be a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and in the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary style, it is impossible to lead the working class\"* (Mao Zedong, \u201cRevolutionary Forces of the World Unite, Fight Against Imperialist Aggression!\u201d (November 1948), Selected Works, Vol. IV, p. 284.).\n\n    The highest ideal of communism pursued by Chinese Communists can be realized only when socialist\n    society is fully developed and highly advanced. The development and improvement of the socialist system is a long historical process. By upholding the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism and following the path suited to China\u2019s specific conditions as chosen by the Chinese people, China\u2019s socialist cause will ultimately be victorious.\n\nWhat China is trying to reach is the *highest phase of communist society.* Karl Marx talks about that in the **Critique of the Gotha Programme**:\n\n    In a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labor, and therewith also the antithesis between mental and physical labor, has vanished; after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-around development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative wealth flow more abundantly -- only then then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners: From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!\n\nAfter Marxism-Leninism, CPC uses as its guide to action the so called \"Mao Zedong Thought\":\n\n    With Comrade Mao Zedong as their chief representative, Chinese Communists developed Mao Zedong Thought by combining the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism with the actual practice of the Chinese revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the application and development of Marxism-Leninism in China; it is a body of theoretical principles and a summary of experiences, proven correct in practice, relating to China\u2019s revolution and construction; and it is a crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party of China. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Communist Party of China led the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in the long revolutionary struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, securing victory in the new democratic revolution and founding the People\u2019s Republic of China, a people\u2019s democratic dictatorship. After the founding of the People\u2019s Republic, the Communist Party of China successfully led the\n    people in carrying out socialist transformation, completing the transition from New Democracy to socialism, establishing the basic socialist system, and developing a socialist economy, politics, and culture. \n\nThere is a big discussion about CPC and the whole Mao Zedong Thought, there are two POVs in this discussion:\n\n1. CPC has completely abandoned MZT.\n2. CPC has evolved MZT into creating a complex theoretical and practical system.\n\nI can only talk about my experience in China, since I asked many people about Mao Zedong, MZT, SWCC and CPC.\n\nThese are my experiences:\n\n1. The first person I asked about Mao Zedong was a buddhist, and he completely hated Mao Zedong. In his opinion, almost everything has changed after Mao's death, but he wasn't a big fan of the CPC too, especially of the last policies of Xi Jinping, which is the most loved leader of China along with Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping.\n2. The second person I asked about Mao Zedong was a complete lover of his country, truly an interesting person. He just knew almost everything about China, about the Empire, the Kuomintang, about Mao Zedong, etc. etc.\n\nHe absolutely knew everything about Mao, read all his works, quoted \"On contradiction\" and the \"Red book\" many times, defended the Cultural Revolution, and told me that Mao is almost considered like a god in China, and that he's considered \"great for war times, not so great for politics\". He asked me \"do you want to know who was great for politics? Zhou Enlai\". He basically told me that Mao Zedong is still loved by the majority of the population (I've visited a house, and they had a big portrait of Mao Zedong. In Guilin, at night, you can see old people going near the lake and start singing songs of the Mao-era).\n\n3) The third person was an absolute comrade, loved the guy, he was funny as hell, his screensaver was a Mao Zedong picture, talked positively about Stalin, defended the CPC policies on Tibet, Tienamnen Square and Taiwan (oh, oh, oh, the things he has told me about Taiwan, americans are starting to be more aggressive with China everyday that passes). He talked about CPC, their vision for communism and what they want to accomplish.\n\nPS: there are many posters and everything about communism and CPC in China, I'll upload some pictures that I've taked, you may find them pretty interesting!).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe've arrived to the so called \"Deng Xiaoping Theory\":\n\n    After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party\n    of China, Chinese Communists, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as their chief representative, analyzed both positive and negative experience gained since the founding of the People\u2019s Republic, emancipated the mind, and sought truth from facts. They shifted the focus of the whole Party\u2019s work onto economic development and introduced reform and opening up, thereby ushering in a new era of development in socialism; they gradually formulated the line, principles, and policies for building socialism with Chinese characteristics, brought clarity to basic questions on building, consolidating, and developing socialism in China, and thus established Deng Xiaoping Theory. Deng Xiaoping Theory is the product of combining Marxism-Leninism\u2019s basic tenets with practice in contemporary China and the particular features of the era; it is a continuation and development of Mao Zedong Thought under new historical conditions; it represents a new stage for the development of Marxism in China; it is the Marxism of contemporary China and a crystallization of the collective\n    wisdom of the Communist Party of China; and it guides the continuous progression of China\u2019s socialist modernization.\n\nOne in my group asked to a chinese about private property, and this person answered that while a private property sector exists, **ALL** the important sectors are state-owned and use economic planning. All the lands are state-owned, for example.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou may want to know about SASAC, I'll give you two links:\n\n1. [http:\/\/en.sasac.gov.cn\/](http:\/\/en.sasac.gov.cn\/) \\-&gt; That's the link of the website in english, it's pretty interesting.\n2. [http:\/\/en.sasac.gov.cn\/2018\/07\/17\/c\\_7.htm](http:\/\/en.sasac.gov.cn\/2018\/07\/17\/c_7.htm) \\-&gt; Here you can find an infographic about what the SASAC does.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNext part of the Constitution is about Three Represents, but I already talked about that, so let's skip it and let's analyze and talk about the \"Scientific Outlook on Development\", which is, trust me, one of the most important theories of SWCC:\n\n    On the basis of the new demands of development they forged a deep understanding of and answered major questions, including what kind of development to pursue and how to pursue it in a new situation, thus forming the Scientific Outlook on Development, which puts people first and calls for comprehensive, balanced, and sustainable development. The Scientific Outlook on Development is a scientific theory that continues in congruence with Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng\n    Xiaoping Theory, and the Theory of Three Represents, while advancing with the times. It fully embodies the Marxist worldview and methodology on development and represents a major achievement in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context. It is a crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party of China and a guiding ideology that must be upheld long term in developing socialism with Chinese characteristics.\n\nDuring Jiang Zemin's years of leadership, with almost incessant growth, new contradictions emerged, the most important being the social inequalities between people and between places. I have visited Shanghai, which is almost futuristic, but I also visited the rural China, and I've seen the inequalities. Scientific Outlook on Development was created to solve this contradiction.\n\nDuring my trip in Hangzhou, a Chinese woman told me that Hangzhou was, years ago, the fifth and then fourth city for economic development in China, after Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzen, now it's at the seventh place. Why? During the great growth of Hangzhou, new social inequalities emerged, by using the SOOD they decided to **grow less, but better**. This concept is applied in almost all China, and with this vision many ecological policies have emerged. You'll see the pictures of urban planning in Shanghai.\n\nWe have arrived to \"Xi Jinping Thought\":\n\n    Since the Party\u2019s 18th National Congress, Chinese Communists, with Comrade Xi Jinping as their chief representative, in response to contemporary developments and by integrating theory with practice, have systematically addressed the major question of our times\u2014what kind of socialism with Chinese characteristics the new era requires us to uphold and develop and how we should uphold and develop it, thus giving shape to Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The Thought is a continuation and development of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng\n    Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development. It is the latest achievement in adapting Marxism to the Chinese context, a crystallization of the practical experience and collective wisdom of the Party and the people, an important component of the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and a guide to action for the entire Party and all the Chinese people to strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and must be upheld long term and constantly developed. Under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, the Communist Party of China has led the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in a concerted effort to carry out a great struggle, develop a great project, advance a great cause, and realize a great dream, ushering in a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics.\n\nIt's different with Xi Jinping, because he hasn't developed a theory or a vision like Jiang or Jintao, his thought was crystallized in the Constitution, and it's now the new addition to the Party's guide to action. Everyone, and I say everyone, that talked about Xi Jinping had only positive things to say. I've heard people criticizing Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, etc. etc. but with Xi Jinping is different. You really perceive that he has a vision not only for China, but for the entire world too. During my stay in Beijing, there was a meeting with Malesia, I saw many CPC functionaries and saw Xi Jinping everywhere.\n\n    China is currently in the primary stage of socialism and will remain so for a long time to come. This is a stage of history that cannot be bypassed as China, which used to be economically and culturally lagging, makes progress in socialist modernization; it will take over a century. China\u2019s development of socialism must begin from China\u2019s own circumstances and must follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. At the present stage, the principal contradiction in Chinese society is that between the ever-growing needs of the people for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development. Owing to both domestic factors and international influences, a certain amount of class struggle will continue to exist for a long time to come, and under certain circumstances may even grow more pronounced, however, it is no longer the principal contradiction. In building socialism in China, the basic tasks are to further release and develop the productive forces and gradually achieve socialist modernization and, to this end, reform those elements and areas within the relations of production and the superstructure that are unsuited to the development of the productive forces.\n\nThis sums up everything I've written before: their goals, the contradictions, the stages of socialism.\n\nThis part is about economic control and planning:\n\n    The Party must uphold and improve the basic economic system whereby public ownership plays a dominant role and economic entities under diverse forms of ownership develop side by side. It must maintain and improve the distribution system whereby distribution according to labor is dominant and a variety of other modes of distribution exist alongside it. It must encourage some areas and some people to become well-off first, gradually eliminate poverty, achieve common prosperity, and on the basis of developing production and social wealth, keep meeting the people\u2019s ever-growing needs for a better life and promote people\u2019s well-rounded development.\n\nAnother concept of CPC is the \"Four Cardinal Principles\", formulated by Deng Xiaoping:\n\n    The Four Cardinal Principles\u2014to keep to the path of socialism, to uphold the people\u2019s democratic dictatorship, to uphold the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and to uphold Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought\u2014form the foundation for building the country. Throughout the whole course of socialist modernization, the Party must adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization.\n\nAs for the so called \"socialist market economy\", it's important to discuss about the public and private sector: while the public sector is planned by the CPC, the non-public sector still has to follow the needs of the country:\n\n    The Communist Party of China shall lead the people in developing the socialist market economy. It shall be firm in consolidating and developing the public sector of the economy and shall remain steadfast in encouraging, supporting, and guiding the development of the non-public sector.\n\nAs for socialist democracy, here's what the CPC is doing to create and develop it:\n\n    The Communist Party of China shall lead the people in developing socialist democracy. It shall preserve the organic unity of Party leadership, the running of the country by the people, and law-based governance, follow the Chinese socialist path of political development, expand socialist democracy, develop a socialist rule of law system with Chinese characteristics, and build a socialist rule of law country, thereby consolidating the people\u2019s democratic dictatorship and developing a socialist political civilization. It shall uphold and improve the people\u2019s congress system, the Communist Party-led system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation, the system of regional ethnic autonomy, and the system of public self-governance at the primary level.\n\nA Chinese person told me about \"two lines\" in China's politics:\n\n1. The first line is communist party.\n2. The second line are elections of mayors, which can be from other political parties, but they still have to follow the CPC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for the so called advanced culture:\n\n    The Communist Party of China shall lead the people in developing advanced socialist culture. It shall promote socialist cultural-ethical progress, ensure the practice of the rule of law in combination with the rule of virtue, and work to strengthen the thinking and morality as well as the knowledge of science and culture of the whole nation to provide powerful ideological guarantees, motivation, and intellectual support for reform, opening up, and socialist modernization, and develop a strong socialist culture in China. It shall strengthen the system of core socialist values, uphold Marxism as its guiding ideology.\n\nRemember when I talked about the ecological policies of PRC?\n\n    The Communist Party of China shall lead the people in building a socialist ecological civilization. It shall strengthen the philosophy underlying ecological civilization that nature should be respected, adapted to, and protected; fully understand that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets; follow the fundamental national policy of conserving resources and protecting the environment; uphold the principle of prioritizing resource conservation and environmental protection and letting nature restore itself; and take a positive path to development that ensures increased production, higher living standards, and healthy ecosystems.\n\nAs for political unity of China:\n\n    The Communist Party of China shall urge all workers, farmers, and intellectuals, and all other political parties, persons without party affiliation, and the patriotic forces of all ethnic groups in China to further develop and expand the broadest possible patriotic united front embracing all socialist workers, all those working for the socialist cause, all patriots who support socialism, all patriots who support the reunification of the motherland, and all patriots who are dedicated to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The Party shall work continuously to strengthen the unity of all the Chinese people, including compatriots in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and in Taiwan as well as overseas Chinese. It shall promote long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao and achieve the reunification of the motherland in conformity with the principle of \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d\n\nIn order to achieve the goal of communism, the Party must follow five fundamental requirements:\n\n1. Adherence to the Party\u2019s basic line.\n2. Commitment to emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, advancing with the times, and being realistic and pragmatic.\n3. Dedication to wholeheartedly serving the people.\n4. Resolve in upholding democratic centralism.\n5. Firmness in exercising strict self-supervision and self-governance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's the link of the CPC Constitution: [http:\/\/www.china.org.cn\/20171105-001.pdf](http:\/\/www.china.org.cn\/20171105-001.pdf)\n\nThat's the link of the PRC Constitution: [http:\/\/en.people.cn\/constitution\/constitution.html](http:\/\/en.people.cn\/constitution\/constitution.html)\n\nI suggest to read both.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\--\n\nHere you can find some of my pictures about everything that I found that was related to communism and CPC in China, enjoy!\n\n[https:\/\/ibb.co\/mtcFqK](https:\/\/ibb.co\/mtcFqK)\n\n[https:\/\/ibb.co\/hwaUHz](https:\/\/ibb.co\/hwaUHz)\n\n[https:\/\/ibb.co\/b1HgVK](https:\/\/ibb.co\/b1HgVK)\n\n[https:\/\/ibb.co\/gSCFqK](https:\/\/ibb.co\/gSCFqK)\n\n[https:\/\/ibb.co\/isKBVK](https:\/\/ibb.co\/isKBVK)\n\n[https:\/\/ibb.co\/bt2n4e](https:\/\/ibb.co\/bt2n4e)\n\n[https:\/\/ibb.co\/dsdzHz](https:\/\/ibb.co\/dsdzHz)\n\n[https:\/\/ibb.co\/k6MKHz](https:\/\/ibb.co\/k6MKHz)\n\n[https:\/\/ibb.co\/gLpBVK](https:\/\/ibb.co\/gLpBVK)\n\n[https:\/\/ibb.co\/ci3icz](https:\/\/ibb.co\/ci3icz)\n\n[https:\/\/ibb.co\/eG8uje](https:\/\/ibb.co\/eG8uje)\n\n[https:\/\/ibb.co\/dS4ycz](https:\/\/ibb.co\/dS4ycz)\n\n[https:\/\/ibb.co\/fEh6VK](https:\/\/ibb.co\/fEh6VK)\n\nI have many more, if you want I can upload more pics! :)","subreddit":"communism","title":"My journey in China, my analysis of SWCC."}

Understanding the reasoning behind that, I just wanted to put forward an extract from the Communist Manifesto that speaks to this issue, so that maybe here we could have a dialogue about our current state of affairs in contrast to how Marx and Engels saw things in their own day. \n\n\"The communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class; but in the movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the future of that movement. In France the communists ally themselves with the Social-Democrats, against the conservative and radical bourgeoise, reserving, however, the right to take up a critical position in regard to phrases and illusions traditionally handed down from the great Revolution. \nIn Switzerland they support the Radicals, without losing sight of the fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements, partly of Democratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly of radical bourgeoisie. \nIn Poland they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution as the prime condition for national emancipation, that party which fomented the insurrection of Cracow in 1846. \nIn Germany they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way, against the absolute monarchy, the feudal squirearchy, and the petty bourgeoisie.\nBut they never cease, for a single instant, to instill into the working class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile antagonism between bourgeoise and proletariat...\"\n\n\nWe must take practical approaches within our societies to bring about the greatest possible good for the working class. This movement is not as strong as it once was, and a hard line approach sometimes undermines what progress can be made. We cannot make the best the enemy of the good.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Thoughts on contemporary Communists' relations to opposition parties."}

How do you guys do it? Is it even worth trying? \n\nI think these people are too indoctrinated to budge on the possibility of being wrong.

They'll purposely ignore and call you out for \"Whataboutism\" if you even attempt to offer the possibility to their brains that Capitalism kills too. \n\nFor some reason I can't break that blockade in their brains and I don't know what will. Perhaps things just need to get much worse for them to learn?

I think it's dangerous to give the right such large platforms to spread propaganda unchecked. I'm afraid of where that will lead. We've already seen the kind of damage people like Alex Jones has done. Infecting even the president with some of his beliefs. Conspiracy and propaganda has run rampant these past few years. \n\nSo this brings me to my final thoughts. And that's on left-wing figureheads. I think they're growing and I'm happy about that.

Hopefully this question is best suited to this sub, if not, let me know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I've been grappling with the concept of historical materialism and the class tensions it observes, I've found that my understanding of how the struggle initially arises from primitive communism to be quite lacking. I've focused purely on understanding feudal\/capitalist\/socialist societies and have researched the initial stages minimally. What I don't understand is what kind of initial tensions or material conditions within a primitive communal society are required to eventually give rise to advanced productive forces, class and a new mode of production.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, we know that Indigenous Australians lived with such a system for at least 50 000 years without ever needing to develop a new mode of production. We have every reason to believe these societies would have continued even further without colonialism and outside interference. Why\/how did other societies initially break out of this system? Especially when, if we take Indigenous Australians as an example, these societies seemed to have no trouble maintaining themselves for millenia without advanced productive forces. What conditions necessitated certain European\/Asian\/South American societies to require the agrarian leap? Was it environmental factors (for example the difference in types of fauna continentally)? Tension between interfering societies\/cultures? With materialism, I know it to be many things, but I'm looking for some suggestions and historical examples here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf anyone has any anthropological texts that dive into this sort of thing, I'm very interested in reading them, especially if they are coming from the Marxist perspective and can advance my understanding of the dialectic method.

What signs do you see in your regular days that makes it clear that capitalism cannot survive indefinitely?\n\nI'll start -\n\nTo keep things simple, I work in the computer field. Specifically, most of my job involves using computers to automate tasks which would take many man-hours to do manually.  \nToday, I did a task for my job. It was fairly simple - I had to make a minor adjustment to a few hundreds of thousands of numbers. The whole job took me maybe three hours to do. If you had to do that job on pen and paper, it would've probably taken a dozen men with calculators a full week to complete.\n\nWas I paid the equivalent of a a week's salary for a dozen men for this job? No! Even before accounting for inflation, the job would've cost much more in a pre-computer era, requiring the employ of many more men to have it done in anything resembling a timely manner.\n\nMy job is to do the work of twelve men, and get paid for maybe one-and-a-half. So what happens to the other ten-and-a-half men?\n\nMany of them are forced into work well below their skills. In my younger days, I worked alongside many of these. People of tremendous ability, with no option but to operate a robot on a factory floor, or deliver pizza. All because they lacked the piece of paper certifying their skill, or the luck to land that all-important interview.\n\nAnd the problem is only going to get worse. Automation encroaches on more professions every year, and the people displaced often have few options when a machine takes their job.  \n What are we to tell to a veteran truck driver when we figure out how to make a perfect, tireless automaton to take their job? The driver that has a wife and children, their own package of debts, and being too old to retrain and start over in a new field?\n\nCapitalism answer is: \"Shouldn't have been a truck driver, then lol\" \n\nAnd automation is coming for many more 'professional' jobs, as well - expect such fields as medicine, law, marketing, and administration to see big advances in automating work in coming years. What are the people supposed to do, when our society demands people do work before they can eat, yet has all its work done machines? Will they just roll over and starve, another sacrifice at the altar of capitalism?\n\nI don't think so. I think the day is coming when the situation becomes so severe that the people take up their recourse of last resort - open rebellion. It may not happen in my lifetime, but it can't be delayed forever.\n\nDuring the Roman Empire, they called Rome \"The Eternal City\", and many truly believed that their supremacy would go on forever - until it didn't. After them, the feudal lords believed they had devised a permanent and God-appointed society - they were thoroughly destroyed. Today, people can't imagine a world which is radically different than it is now - but I guarantee, that world will come.\n\nNothing lasts forever, so stand up and take a hand in building a better future.\n\n___________________________\n\nWhew, that rant went on much longer than I expected. I don't expect such screeds from any here (though they are welcome!)

His history is one of many struggles but great triumphs; a Russian and soon\u2010to\u2010be Soviet agronomist who bred one of the strongest and highest\u2010yielding crops in the world.\n\n**Pavel Pantelimonovich Luk\u2019ianenko** grew up in Tsarist Russia, repeatedly enduring famine and deprivation during his early life. His own and his family\u2019s experiences led him to side with the Bolsheviks. Soon he became a plant breeder based on certain experiences, such as witnessing an infestation damage a crop. Soon enough he was familiarised with Kuban farming\u2019s chronic problems: plant diseases, lodging, drought, even uncooperative misbehavior from local peasants, but the prospect of creating crop varieties to overcome these worries persuaded him to commit his life to this career in the 1920s. He bred forty\u2010nine different crops, most of which were too feeble, but he didn\u2019t give up. Fascists invaded the region in which he was working, but he didn\u2019t give up; he and his wife packed up their goods, including lots of grain, and fled elsewhere. He had to work in spite of a charlatan trying to monopolize a scientific field, but he still didn\u2019t give up. And his magnum opus, Bezostaia-1, was one the best, strongest crops in the world and was planted in dozens of millions of hectares.\n\n&gt;\u2018[Bezostaia-1 was planted on large areas: at least 13 million hectares (32 million acres) by the late 1960s in the USSR and Eastern Europe, as well as in Iran, Turkey, and in other arid regions. By 1972, it was reportedly planted on 18 million hectares (45 million acres). **Western scientists consistently noted its high yields and plasticity, and recognized Luk\u2019ianenko as one of the major wheat breeders of the world**. [\u2026] Luk\u2019ianenko\u2019s work [\u2026] produced several extremely important wheat varieties that had the same characteristics as the Green Revolution varieties that Borlaug created. Luk\u2019ianenko\u2019s Bezostaia-1, a semi-dwarf rust resistant HYV earned the highest praise of both European and American breeders (including Borlaug) as one of the best of the HYVs.

But the important part is for about 14 years, a center-left government made a lot of social politics on Brazil, but also helping a lot of right wing sectors like banks and the national bourgeoisie to maintain government stability. But the necessity to applying a neo-liberal agenda was big, and a state coup started to be organized withing the legislative and the state justice with collaboration with those right wing sectors and the middle class. It happened in 2016 and the new government did a LOT of terrible reforms specially on the workers rights and public sectors (health, education).\n\nThe communists on Brazil, a small percentage of the left, tried terribly to stop the application of those reforms and failed in every single one of them.

{"author":"TightRead4","created_utc":1537796141,"num_comments":6,"score":6,"selftext":" \n\nWhile all eyes are on the unfolding trade war between China and the United States, another crisis in the world economy is threatening to spin out of control. Since April, Argentina and Turkey have seen their currencies collapse and inflation spiral. Other so-called emerging economies such as Indonesia, India, Brazil and South Africa are also coming under similar pressures.\n\nLast week, the Central Bank of Argentina was forced to raise interest rates to a record 60 percent in order to stop the slide of the country\u2019s currency, which lost 12 percent of its value against the US Dollar over two days. Having spent most of its currency reserves to defend the Peso, President Mauricio Macri\u2019s government has had to beg the IMF to speed up a bailout package worth $50bn.\n\nThe latest fall of the Peso comes on top of a continuous decline, which since April has taken off more than 50 percent of the currency\u2019s value against the dollar. At the same time, inflation has crept up above 30 percent. The resulting instability is in turn pushing the economy into a crisis, leading to further capital flight.\n\n## Crises in Turkey\u00a0\n\nA similar situation is developing in Turkey, where the Lira has lost 40 percent of its value against the dollar in the past year as inflation has shot up to 18 percent. Last Monday, the Turkish central bank announced a 6.25 percent rise of the interest rate to 24 percent in order to stop the free fall of the Lira. But after a short stabilisation, the currency has continued its depreciation.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2008 the Turkish economy was developing at a rapid pace. As an untapped pool of cheap labour on the border of EU, the Turkish economy rapidly grew on the back of the pre-2008 boom in Europe. Turkish GDP nearly quadrupled (tripled if adjusted for inflation) from $200bn in 2001 to $764bn in 2008. But the 2008 world economic crisis ended the period of organic growth and the following year saw a contraction of the Turkish economy similar to many other countries. Since then, the economy has been increasingly dependent on speculative money and cheap credit flowing from western countries to keep growth levels up.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Deficit spending and cheap credit have left Turkey facing an economic disaster \/ Image: Flickr, unaoc\n\nTurkish banks alone went from a net foreign debt of zero in 2008 to $100bn today. $6-9bn of these loans are maturing every month. At the same time, the AKP government has embarked on a massive Keynesian spending spree, investing in huge, prestigious infrastructure projects and property developments in order to maintain its political rule. Thus, the construction sector, which employs 2m workers, amounts to 18.7 percent of the GDP. According to official figures, at the end of 2016, 90 percent of funding for Turkish real estate companies was based on loans in foreign currencies. In total, Turkish foreign debt stands at 52 percent of its GDP.\n\nThe AKP government, desperate to maintain its voter base, has been fanning the fire, funding enormous prestige projects by deficit spending. In the run-up to the previous elections, it used its Credit Guarantee Fund to guarantee billions of dollars of loans in the private sector. At the same time, the ruling class has been promoting enormous growth of credit amongst the masses, taking household debt from around 2.5 percent of GDP in 2014 to 17.30 percent in 2017. The Erdogan government thought that it could borrow its way out of the crisis, and keep the economy afloat by flooding the market with cheap credit. But as always, debt has to be repaid sooner or later, with interest. Consequently, the Lira has been debased leading to a steep fall in the currency markets as well as high inflation internally. Reluctantly, the government has been forced to accept huge interest rate rises in order to avert an uncontrolled spiral of inflation and a collapse of the currency.\n\nThe situation is only made worse by Turkey\u2019s high dependence on imports of vital goods such as energy as well as steel, which it imported to the tune of $8bn per year by the end of 2017, before the value of the Lira halved. This makes the economy even more sensitive to foreign exchange fluctuations.\n\nOn top of all this, the US has imposed a series of tariffs on Turkish goods in a brewing conflict between the two supposed allies. This has brought out all the underlying weaknesses of the economy.\n\nIn this situation, the rise of the value of the dollar spells an impending disaster for the Turkish economy. Already several major Turkish corporations have had trouble paying their creditors and more are at risk of defaulting on their loans now that the Lira is worth half as much as a year ago.\n\n## Twin deficit in Argentina\n\nArgentina, like Turkey, is also running a so-called twin deficit. That is, it has a serious yearly budget deficit as well as a current account deficit, making it dependent on foreign credit. Yearly Foreign Direct investments trebled from $3.2 billion in 2016 to $11.9 billion in 2017, in total making up more than 16 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, the state was running a yearly budget deficit of around 5 percent. This was being funded by foreign debt on the one hand and printing billions of Pesos on the other, thereby gradually debasing the currency.\n\nBut all was fine as long as long as foreign money was flowing in. Assured by the right-wing Macri government\u2019s promises to protect their interests, foreign speculators were satisfied with covering the growing trade and budget deficits. Until that is, the dollar price started creeping upwards at the beginning of this year.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Argentina and Turkey are only symptomatic of a deeper crisis \/ Image: Mauricio Macri inaugur\u00f3 la ampliaci\u00f3n del Centro de Formaci\u00f3n Profesional de Mataderos\n\nBut Argentina and Turkey are only the most acute indication of a much deeper problem. Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa, all sizeable economies, are dealing with similar, albeit less acute, crises. Other so-called emerging economies are not far behind. 16 of these countries alone sit on $3.4tn of foreign debt. Their foreign exchange reserves however only amount to $1.3tn. Most of these are also heavily dependent on cheap credit as well as a stable dollar value.\n\nIn total, in these \u2018emerging markets\u2019, debt amongst the non-banking private sector has increased sharply since 2008-09, reaching 129 percent of GDP today. At the same time, loose monetary policies have gradually debased their currencies. Over the past five years, the currencies of Argentina, Ukraine, Egypt, Turkey, and Brazil have all declined by 80.3 percent, 69.0 percent, 60.9 percent, 60.5 percent and 42.5 percent respectively against the dollar.\n\nThe Indian Rupee is on the same path, having lost 13.50 percent of its value against the dollar in the past 12 months, reaching an all-time low. Meanwhile, the interest rates on government-issued bonds reached 8.19 percent because investors are less willing to lend money to the state as they have less confidence that these will be paid back. The Indian economy, the sixth largest in the world, is in a very weak state and a rising dollar, affecting crucial imports such as oil, could have a disastrous effect, leading to a vicious downward spiral.\n\n## Built on sand\n\nOn paper, the world economy seems to be doing great. World GDP is set to grow by 3.9 percent in 2018, unemployment figures have been decreasing over the past year and the Dow Jones index at the New York stock exchange is at its highest level ever. Yet, 10 years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the global financial crisis, a crisis of new proportions is looming on the horizon.\n\nThe ruling class found a way out of the 2008 crisis by carrying out austerity and pushing down wages, while simultaneously pumping trillions of dollars of cheap credit into the system. The US interest rate stood at 0.20 percent \u2013 an all-time low. The interest rates were so low, that *not* taking out loans was bad business for the big capitalists. But far from solving the crisis of capitalism, these measures only prepared for far bigger crises to come.\n\nTotal world debt today stands at $217tn, or 327 percent of world GDP: the highest in history. But very little of this money has been invested in actual production. In fact, investment rates have not been lower since the 1960s. Instead, the money has been flowing through the world economy creating inflationary bubbles in different sectors such as housing and the stock markets.\n\nThe cheap credit saved the capitalist class, but it did not solve anything fundamentally. A major problem arising from this is the new undergrowth of \u2018zombie companies\u2019 throughout advanced economies. These are companies that make less profit than their interest payments on their debt. They have only been kept alive by cheap credit. In the US, ten percent of all companies fall into this category.\n\nIf interest rates rise above 2 percent (they are expected to reach 3 percent by 2020) $2.3tn worth of US companies would be zombie companies. The Bank for International Settlements estimates that the proportion of zombie companies in six major eurozone economies, including Germany, France and Spain, has risen from 5.5 percent in 2007 to 10 percent today. Other surveys indicate that the proportion in Italy and Spain has tripled in a decade.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7Trump has been critical of the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, but the fact is that the central banks have little room for manoeuvre \/ Image: Flickr, Gage Skidmore\n\nThe \u2018emerging economies\u2019 are not much different in that they are, from a capitalist point of view, unsustainable economies that have been kept afloat by cheap credit. While debt levels in the advanced economies grew by 20 percent from 2007 to 2016, they grew by 280 percent in the emerging markets! Indeed, a huge proportion of world growth after 2008 has been coming from the \u2018emerging markets\u2019. In 2016, the seven main countries often named as emerging markets accounted for 1 percentage point of the 2.4 percent world economic growth. The G7 on the other hand only contributed 0.7 percentage points.\n\nIf the Federal Reserve could keep printing money, all would be well, but it cannot. Sooner or later this would lead to spiralling inflation. In fact, inflation went from -0.09 percent in January 2015 to 2.07 percent in January 2018 and shot up to 2.95 percent by July. Consumer price increases are at their highest since 2011 and they are expected to continue to rise. Until now price inflation has been moderate because the US wages were being pushed down and unemployment was rising \u2013 that is, demand was low. But in the last year, recovery in the US has meant a slight increase in household income and a drop in unemployment. This is now bringing out the contradictions accumulated after the 2008 crisis.\n\nIn order to avert runaway inflation, or what bourgeois economists call \u201coverheating\u201d of the economy, the ruling class has been trying to end quantitative easing and gradually raise interest rates. The US Federal Reserve has ended its QE programme and its base rate now stands at 1.75 percent and is expected to go up to 3 percent next year. The US recovery and rising interest rates are also pushing up the price of the dollar \u2013 which is particularly strong because other G7 countries have still kept their interest rates at record lows.\n\n## House of cards begins to collapse\n\nWhat we see in the emerging economies are the first consequences of this process. As cheap credit dries up and the dollar rises, all the underlying weaknesses of these economies come to the fore. US President Donald Trump has been heavily critical of the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, but the fact is that the central banks have little room for manoeuvre. If all the excess money printed in the past period is not reigned in, it could lead to an uncontrolled spiral of inflation and crisis, which would, in the end, force it to raise the rates, just like what happened in Turkey. In fact, interest rates on US treasury bonds and other loans that are not controlled by the FED have already been going up. Over 20 months, the interest rates of US ten-year Treasury bonds more than doubled, from 1.38 percent to 2.94 percent in February 2018, reflecting rising inflation and expectations of rising economic instability in the next period.\n\nWhat we see here are the first signs of the collapsing of the house of cards built to sustain the world economy after the 2008 crisis. The ruling class thought that it could find a way out of the crisis by pumping trillions of dollars into the system, but it has only managed to create even bigger contradictions. The world economy is littered with flammable material \u2013 from the brewing crisis in the \u2018emerging economies\u2019 to the zombie companies in the advanced capitalist countries.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7These looming crises will have the effect of pushing the class struggle to new levels \/ Image: Socialist Appeal\n\nMost importantly, these looming crises will have the effect of pushing the class struggle to new levels. In Turkey, the comfortable rule of the AK Party is no longer guaranteed as millions of Turks are seeing their income being eaten up by inflation and their mortgages and loans payments soar. In Argentina, Macri has announced a vicious austerity package, which this year alone will be worth 1.2 percent of GDP and 1.4 percent next year. In the US and in Europe \u2013 where the European Central Bank has announced interest rate hikes next summer \u2013 mortgages are set to rise dramatically and millions of jobs could be at risk when the undergrowth of unprofitable banks and companies are hit by rising interest rates. This time, unlike in 2008, the capitalists will not have the same tools \u2013 i.e. printing money and offering low interest rates \u2013 to avert a crisis. Those tools have already been used up.\n\nOf course, the majority of the burden for the crisis, as has been the case until now, will be put on the shoulders of the working class. This will push the workers into the arena of struggle in one country after another to defend their living standards. Ironically all of this is taking place at a time where the productive capacity of humanity has never been higher. But within the confines of capitalism the means of production cannot be used for a harmonious development of society. Capitalism is an anarchic system with its own laws far beyond the control of humanity. The only way out of the impasse is to overthrow the system and replace it with a socialist planned economy, which can use the enormous potential of humanity that is otherwise squandered in the neverending misery of capitalism.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Argentina, Turkey and the debt bomb under the world economy"}

Why is it that our economic system is somehow a religion? It goes beyond nationalism and is revered as perfect and without a nation. I feel like I am not alone thinking this in ECON classes. Economists are just pompus as hell. So much is assumed about how people will act and how firms will operate then it is passed on as perfect fact. \n\nSorry for my rant I just needed a break from this garbage textbook.

Would yall be willing to answer this?\n\nI recently got in a debate with a liberal buddy of mine over socializing healthcare in the US. I pointed to Cuba as evidence of a successful state run healthcare system and he provided me with this Thesis published by a doctor who worked there for 9 months.\n\nhttps:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090317225912\/http:\/\/www.miscelaneasdecuba.net\/media\/pdf\/Article-Hirschfeld-Press.pdf\n\nIt seems that the argument against the Cuban healtchares system is that no one outside of the government has ever independently verified their statistics, so they could all be made up (and according to this Thesis, there's lots of evidence that points towards that). There are NGO's and western governments that write favorable reports on Cuba's system but these reports only come through state sanctioned tours of the system that only show the part of the health care system that actually helps the rich and tourists. The majority of people in cuba are not in that situation. Cuba does these tours and evaluations for PR, while lying and obfuscating any real stats.\n\nAdditionally, the doctors are paid very little and pimped out to other countries and used to generate over 7 billion in money for the government while getting paid around 50 bucks a month.\n\nI'd like to know your thoughts on this because I can't exactly counter this claim. If a study like this exists, I think we need to rigorously go through it and criticize it and not just brush it off as \"western propaganda\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts comrads?","subreddit":"communism","title":"A question about Cuban Healthcare system"}

I am not a M-L, and would put myself somewhere between a De Leonist and an AnCom, so if I miss some statistic or something like that I apologize I tried my best to be thorough but it\u2019s possible I missed some things.  That being said I also would like it known this is an analysis of the Soviet economy and not the whole society as Prager asserts it was economically a failure. Now with that quick disclaimer out of the way let\u2019s start.\n\n1913 vs 1928\nWhen PragerU asserts that the USSR was plagued by \u201crepeated economic failures,\u201d they are either being ignorant or dishonest. Neither of which can really be forgiven especially not when 1.7M+ could watch your video and believe lies or ignorance because your a \u201cuniversity.\u201d Now getting to the statistics we see PragerU is pretty wrong. Soviet economic figures in 1928 were already surpassing pre-was standards in industry, oil production for instance, by 1928 had, risen by over three million metric tons, from its 1913 amount. Meanwhile, however, in 1928,  in agriculture the amount of acres of grain harvested had fallen from its pre-war amount, this had however been caused by bad weathers in the Ukraine. Despite the averse meteorological conditions, agriculture was also being improved from its pre-was standards. For instance, crop rotation was introduced replacing the traditional three field system, and agricultural knowledge was spread via radio. So from the time between 1925-1928 while agriculture did falter due to unfavorable conditions in the Ukraine, industry increased heavily. [(source)](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/history\/ussr\/government\/1928\/sufds\/index.htm)\nFirst 5-year plan\nI think the best way to show how effective the 5-year plans were at rapid industrialization is to show the rates of automobile production within the USSR. In prewar Russia there were around 9,000 in 1914, and about 19,000 in 1928. By the end of 1937, after two, 5 year plans, there was a total of approximately 760,000 automobiles. [(source)](https:\/\/archive.org\/stream\/in.ernet.dli.2015.211605\/2015.211605.Russias-Soviet#page\/n373\/mode\/2up) Needless to say the 5 year plans were overall a success. Another industrial success was the expansion of capital goods by 158% as well as consumer goods by 87%. [(source)](https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/09668135308409870)Let\u2019s turn to agriculture where rapid collectivization stalin alleged led to \u201cdizzying success,\u201d while this is probably an overstatement collectivization and agriculture still improved granted it was nothing compared to the second 5 year plans wheat productions.\nSecond 5 year plan\nLet\u2019s first start with the huge success of agriculture during the second 5 year plan, grain harvest in 1937 at the end of the plan, reached levels never before seen, at 120.3 million. This allowed the soviets to to practically guaranteed the needs of Soviet citizens were met. Many mistakes made from 1929 to 1933 were also corrected during this time. [(source)](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/strauss\/part6.htm)As such agriculture began to reach new heights, but PragerU would like you to think this and all developments had been \u201ceconomic failures.\u201d While the agriculture developments are impressive again industrial progress overshadows agricultural progress. Heavy industry within the USSR had finally been created and cemented, and shortages in essential industries had pretty much been eliminated. For instance steel had increased 200%, coal production increased by 98%, energy production increased by 172% [(source)](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/strauss\/part6.htm) but again PragerU wants it\u2019s viewers to ignore this progress and assume the Soviet Union\u2019s economy was full \u201crepeated economic failures.\u201d\n\nFurther reading\/viewing\nThere are plenty of other people who\u2019ve written more in depth than I did here so for a more elaborate delve into these than I went check out.\nFinnish Bolshevik\u2019s breakdown [here](https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/mltheory.wordpress.com\/2016\/08\/07\/the-results-of-the-1st-2nd-soviet-five-year-plans-soviet-industrial-revolution\/amp\/)\nAs well as many many videos else where.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Debunking Prageru\u2019s myth that the Soviet Union suffered \u201crepeated economic failures\u201d"}

How might a future socialist state fix these problems? They are outlined thus:\n\n1.  Managers were little inclined to pursue technological paths that might lead to their own obsolescence. Many of them were not competent in the new technologies and should have been replaced. \n2. Managers received no rewards for taking risks. They maintained their positions regardless of whether innovative technology was developed, as was true of their superiors and central planners. \n3. Supplies needed for technological change were not readily available. Since inputs were fixed by the plan and all materials and labor were fully committed, it was difficult to divert resources to innovative production. In addition, experimentation increased the risks of failing to meet one s quotas. \n4. There was no incentive to produce better machines for other enterprises since that brought no rewards to one's own firm. Quite the contrary, under the pressure to get quantitative results, managers often cut corners on quality. \n5. There was a scarcity of replacement parts both for industrial production and for durable-use consumer goods. Because top planners set such artificially low prices for spare parts, it was seldom cost-efficient for factories to produce them. \n6. Because producers did not pay real-value prices for raw materials, fuel, and other things, enterprises often used them inefficiently. \n7. Productive capacity was under-utilized. Problems of distribution led to excessive unused inventory. Because of irregular shipments, there was a tendency to hoard more than could be put into production, further adding to shortages. \n8. Improvements in production would lead only to an increase in one's production quota. In effect, well-run factories were punished with greater work loads. Poor performing ones were rewarded with lower quotas and state subsidies. ","subreddit":"communism","title":"Fixing economic issues of the USSR"}

This was considerably above the average yearly wage of 264 rubles for factory workers, equal to that of a teacher in a factory or municipal school, but well below that of 1200 rubles earned by zemstvo (local government authority) doctors. Molotov's mother, Anna Yakovlevna, came from a wealthy merchant family, the Nebogatikovs, who ran a flourishing trading house in Kukarka. She was the daughter of Mikhail, Skryabin's employer, whose three brothers took over the business on their father's death. They were sufficiently wealthy to keep two river steamers.\n\nVyacheslav was the ninth child of a family of ten, three of whom died in infancy. One daughter and six sons survived to adulthood. The family was cultured. They were distantly related to the composer and pianist Aleksandr Skryabin (1872-1915), well known in Moscow polite society in the late nineteenth century. The physical resemblance between him and Vyacheslav, his second cousin, is quite striking, and long after he was better known as Molotov, Vyacheslav wrote Skryabin in brackets on official documents, perhaps partly to remind the reader of his famous musical connections From an early age, he seems to have displayed the family's musical ability, developing an interest in playing the violin that was to remain with him for the rest of his life. Nikolai, one of his older brothers, became a composer, and although he achieved no prominence, he changed his name to Nolinsk to avoid confusion with the famous Aleksandr Skryabin. Another brother tried to become a painter, and yet another became an army doctor.\n\nIt was a conventional late nineteenth century petty bourgeois family: education and religion were important. The father sang in the church choir and remained religious up to his death in 1923, but he also drank and beat his children.\n\nVyacheslav, who as the result of a serious illness, used spectacles to read from the age of eight, and always suffered from a stammer, was educated initially at the local village school, transferring schools at the age of seven when the family moved to Nolinsk. This town some 40 miles away from Kukarka, again of medieval origins, was the administrative headquarters of the district, and a centre for political exiles. The next year he was sent to the local gymnasium, the type of school where pupils were given a traditional education based on the classics and prepared for university entry. This choice, for a younger son, was indicative of the social ambitions of the Skryabin family. Vyacheslav took the preparatory and junior classes, but in 1902, when he was twelve, he failed his examinations, although his mother gave him an ikon to carry in his pocket to help him. In his memoirs, he confessed to having relied on it, but said it did not give him the answers.\n\nAccompanied by his mother, and a younger brother who was put in the preparatory class, Vyacheslav now became a pupil at the real\u2019noe uchilishche (real school) in Kazan, which three of his elder brothers also attended. At the end of the first year their mother returned to Nolinsk and the brothers shared and rented a room, living with the family of their cousin, Lidiya Petrovna Chirkova, a midwife. She was married to a Ukrainian, A.S. Kulesh, a prominent member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the main Marxist revolutionary party, which divided into two fractions, Bolsheviks and Mensheviks in 1903. Kulesh became a Bolshevik and was active in Kazan. The environment in which he now lived and worked was an important factor in turning Vyacheslav into a revolutionary. In contrast, his brothers always seem to have been on the fringes of revolutionary activity, but never prominent. Nikolai, who was four years older, was the most active of the three.\n\nReal schools, introduced under Count Dimitri Tolstoi\u2019s reforms in the 1870s, were, in 1902, in a phase of rapid expansion. From 1888, after a preliminary year, they offered a general education for the first four years. Modern languages replaced the classical languages of the gymnasium, and pupils who failed languages or mathematics at the gymnasium, were encouraged to transfer to real schools. They were designed to train local officials and managers, as well as agricultural and industrial technicians. In the fifth and sixth year specialisation began; two courses were offered: general education and business. A specialised seventh grade was introduced in 1901, allowing pupils, like those in the gymnasiya, especially those with higher technical education in view, to qualify for university entry.\n\nVyacheslav, who claimed in his memoirs that he had most ability in mathematics, achieved the top mark \u2018five\u2019 or \u2018excellent\u2019 in 12 subjects from 14, and the next mark \u2018four\u2019 or \u2018good\u2019 in the other two, at the end of the sixth grade which he completed in June 1908. He was clearly a very intelligent pupil, for Lenin achieved \u2018five\u2019 only in ten subjects, although this was at a gymnasium. When, in exile in 1910, at the age of twenty, Vyacheslav took the examinations at the end of the special seventh grade, he was awarded the top mark in religious studies, German, French, algebra, special course in analytical geometry, physics, history, mathematical geography (cosmography), design and law. He gained the second mark in trigonometry, arithmetic, and Russian language; and the third mark \u2018satisfactory\u2019 in only one subject, natural history. With marks of this standard he was in a position to proceed to higher education. If this was not uncommon among Bolshevik leaders of his generation, it was rather unusual for a Bolshevik leader to have been educated in a \u2018real school\u2019.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAdapted from Molotov: A Biography by Derek Watson\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSources for it being:\n\n1.
