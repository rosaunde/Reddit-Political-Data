It can be primarily categorized into these groups -\n\n1. Communism did not / does not work.\n2. Communism killed 100 million people.\n3. LTV is flawed / refuted. Value is subjective. Hence exploitation does not exist.\n\nI have to stress hard to think of any set of arguments *NOT* made on these lines. So I am working on a small online book that covers these and refutes them \"sufficiently\".\n\nThis is what the purpose of the content of the book is and is not : -\n\nIS \n\na] Since it is meant to be small and it's target audience is people who are completely unaware about communism, To work as a \"quick but sufficiently powerful\" knock out to all the mainstream pooh pooh type anti communist propaganda. It has to work on intuitive level. \nb] Which gets people convinced enough that they have been lied to. As \"immediate conversion\" is impossible, the aim is to get them sufficiently convinced that they have been lied to about capitalism and communism.\nc] Introduce / invite them to study further about the subject online (Invitation to online forums like this, recommending them Youtube channels like the Finnish Bolshevik)\n\nIS NOT -\n\na] A deep, technical and detained explanation of everything stated. (So, for instance, if the question is on Central planning, the answer would not be to show how it was applied and worked, but a quick intuitive come back with \"All capitalist corporations are centrally planned\")\n\nI need suggestions from the comrades here about the idea and some of the essence of the content.\n\nI am planning a small PDF type book thing that covers rebuttals to them. I am sharing the brief of the rebuttals here.\n\nFor instance, with the ..\n\n..1. \"It does not work\" argument, I will build the chapter around this -\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/6uhar8/comrades_reading_the_declassified_post_ww2/\n\nGoing to add U.S'es death toll around the world during cold war.\n\n2. For, \"Communism killed 100 million people\" I am going to use this. \n\nIt is from American Historical Association, and concludes that the number of \"civilians\" dead in the Gulag was less than a million. \n\nhttp://www.cercec.fr/materiaux/doc_membres/Gabor%20RITTERSPORN/Victims%20of%20the%20Gulag.pdf\n\nFor the \"LTV is refuted / Austrian economics is right\" argument, I will start with showing how wages are less than productivity \"empirically\" (using stats), and then show why the need emerges to white wash this and hence comes the \"right wing obfuscations\".\n\nThen I plan to use these arguments -\n\n1. It is impossible of value to be subjective / Austrian economics to be right. If a commodity takes 10 days to build, and a worker needs 1$ per day to survive (food, clothing, shelter), it is impossible that the price of that commodity can be less than 10$ (as 1$ has to be spent on the worker each day, every 10 days).\n2. Austrian economics is based on a circular logic. Prices are a prerequisite to make subjective evaluation (Is the commodity worth the price?), however, prices are then explained as having origin in subjective evaluation. Market Competition has a constant, observable, effect on prize, yet it has nothing to do with subjective consumer evaluation. \n3. Labor theory of value essentially states that if a commodity is 5 times more expensive than another commodity, it is because it takes an average of 5 times more time to produce the first commodity in comparison to the next. It traces the value of commodity to the labor time required to produce it. Hence it observes and predicts that the moment the labor time required to produce a commodity falls, it's value goes down. While the beloved Austrians completely wash their hands of any empiricism. \n\nhttps://i.redditmedia.com/wVXcwPofjshP7_GIuW40KI3t7AXwJurPOaiFseu6cKQ.png?w=500&amp;s=f9fb66e8130a62bd42c352ef837dbd08\n\nSuggestions / ideas / inputs / help will be greatly appreciated comrades. If you have better / more intuitive arguments, please do share. If you have suggestions to how to make the book more appealing (what kind of graphics to use, quotes from revolutionaries, and so on), do let me know.\n\nThanks!

Let's clarify one thing: I'm a marxist-leninist, so this post contains views which other political schools within this board won't surely agree with.\n\nToday I went to visit my grandparents. They are both very old; around 80 years-old. We usually talk a lot about politics, and each time I come back home from the little village they live in, I always notice that their negativity towards a real change in society increases. They are Basque nationalists, but with a left-leaning thought that I would describe as some sort of liberation theology.\n\nToday we talked about the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, Catalonia's independece, ETA (Basque Motherland and Freedom: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETA_(separatist_group)), the immigration from the Middle-East and Africa\u2026 etc., a bit about everything. After all that, I asked my grandfather: \"Do you think it is possible a change in the world?\" He started to laugh and he answered that it's impossible, and world is going to be worse in 20 years time.\n\nSo now, I think that we, the ones who consider ourselves revolutionaries, should ask to ourselves this question: what are we doing? Since May 1968, the left gave up fighting for the emancipation of humanity, of the poor and exploited people, to embrace a soft form of capitalism which would give solutions to this \"intersectional\" \"fights\" such as race and gender. In western countries there has been no revolutionary parties since then, and the bourgoisie won the Cold War.\n\nThe majority of us live in liberal democracies where politics are just some weird circuses with clowns and puppets controlled by the ruling classes. It's hard to point out a difference between \"left-wing\" and right-wing parties.\n\nThe far-right has been transforming itself to adapt to this \"end of the world\" society, as postmodernists philosophers like to call our present-day world. They reinvented their \"theory\" (if we can call it like that) and their popularity is increasing day by day, governing some countries like Poland or having great electoral results, such as in Germany.\n\nWe, \"revolutionaries\", what are we doing? We just live our lifes, studying or working, and we waste our time with different things (right now I'm doing it writing in this board). I'm in my last year before college, I manage to get high marks and compete in Taekwondo, but politically I'm barely doing nothing. Yes, I'm a member and president of a student revolutionary association, but that's it. The association is doing little, we just collect moneys from our members to rent some establishment in our working-class neighbourhood to organize free English and Basque languages courses, help locals with school material\u2026 You get the idea. But that's it.\n\nIf you've read this post, rethink your life. We are doomed as revolutionaries, because we cannot look away the huge problems our world has. We need to study more, work more and exercise more. We need to have discipline. \n\nGet your fat ass off the chair and start doing something, or you'll be a fraud like me.\"\n\n\"Man's dearest possession is life. It is given to him but once, and he must live it so as to feel no torturing regrets for wasted years, never know the burning shame of a mean and petty past; so live that, dying he might say: all my life, all my strength were given to the finest cause in all the world\u2014the fight for the Liberation of Mankind.\"","subreddit":"communism","title":"[Reflection] \"What are we doing, comrades?\""}

This title would come with bringing topics to discuss/general leading of discussions at our meetings, organizing events for our group to host or attend, and other task commonly associated with leadership of clubs.

We haven't reached automation because mass automation would cause hyperinflation and a collapse of the capitalist economy.\n\nIf the working class is vastly out of jobs, and the only people buying goods are the bourgeoisie, then wouldn't that cause hyperinflation?

{"author":"LaughingFox33","created_utc":1518930815,"num_comments":1,"score":13,"selftext":"The antidemocratic exclusion of Venezuela from the Summit of the Americas, agreed on February 13th in Lima by governments closely allied with the United States, is aimed to reinforce the siege, the isolation and the gestation of the overthrown, by force, of the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. \n\n\nIt is know that Washington and the right wing are fully employed in the overthrown, by force, of the Bolivarian Revolution.  But the spokesmen of empire declare it blatantly already, as Secretary of State and former CEO of Exxon, Rex Tillerson did in his speech at the University of Texas or, days later, the senator of Cuban origin Marco Rubio, whom Trump has given the operation of the policy towards Cuba and Venezuela. \n\n\nThe so-called Lima Group proclaimed it does not recognize the presidential elections convened for April 22 by the Venezuelan electoral authority and reiterated its non-recognition of the National Constituent Assembly. At the same time, it invoked as justification for his attitudes a biased report of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights which, violating the norms that govern it, doesn\u2019t take into account the opinion of the Venezuelan government, as well as the decision to conduct a preliminary report on Venezuela by the International Criminal Court\u2019s Prosecutor. This court is a colonial instrument in which none of the flagrant and massive violations of human rights of the United States have ever been judged nor the unequaled crimes against humanity committed in the constant wars of aggression in which it embarks. Other important aspects of the declaration refer to the humanitarian situation and the flow of migrants from Venezuela to other countries.\n\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find a statement on Venezuela more mendacious, interventionist, subservient to imperialism and full of contempt for the will of the Venezuelan people and the principles of international law by the aforementioned group. By repeating the same accusations of Washington and the big media corporations, it contributes to the justification for a military intervention or a bloody coup d'\u00e9tat in the homeland of Bolivar.\n\n\nThis is even more serious after the announcement of the new national security strategy of the United States that considers Russia and China as more important threats than terrorism, since both countries are close allies of Venezuela. Likewise, after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s criticism launched against both powers on each scale of his tour. In view of the meeting in Lima, it\u2019s clear what was probably the most important subject of the treaties by the Secretary of State in the countries he visited, precisely the most active against Venezuela in the Lima Group.\n\n\nIf we add to this the growing presence of the United States military in the region, the recent visit of Admiral Kurt Tidd to Colombia and the displacement of troops from Colombia and Brazil to the Venezuelan border while seeking to exacerbate the issue of Venezuelan migration, it seems to be creating the perfect storm for an armed intervention in Venezuela with the slightest excuse. Only the provocation is missing, a false positive maybe, which could lead to an eventual attack from Colombia or some violent action within Venezuela that justifies the intervention of one or more Latin American armies, which would create the scenario for the intervention of some kind of forces of the Southern Command.\n\n\nBased on these elements of judgment, it is easier to understand the urgency of the United States and the Colombian oligarchy for bursting the dialogue table in the Dominican Republic between the opposition and the Venezuelan government. If the agreement had been signed, which was ready and approved by the parties, the interventionist plot against Venezuela would have been deactivated, at least for a long time.\n\n\nAs if this were not enough, Luis Almagro, the unpresentable secretary general of the OAS, questioned the legitimacy of Cuban elections and tacitly suggested La Havana should not attend the Summit of the Americas, since \"dictatorships\" should not be invited. Cuba always requires solidarity, of course. But, above all, Venezuela needs it from all the true democrats, progressives and revolutionaries. In Venezuela, a decisive struggle for democracy and self-determination of the people is waged. It is the Spanish republic of today, but we must prevent it from running its same destiny.\n\n\nAuthor: \u00c1ngel Guerra\n\nDate: February 15, 2018\n\nSource: https://www.telesurtv.net/bloggers/Venezuela-crece-la-amenaza-de-intervencion--20180215-0002.html","subreddit":"communism","title":"Venezuela: intervention menace grows"}

{"author":"prince_kapone","created_utc":1518989240,"num_comments":0,"score":5,"selftext":"The Sandcastle and the Coming Storm, Part 1\n\nBy: Prince Kapone\n\nThe U.S. economy, and the capitalist world system as a whole, is like a giant castle made out of sand. It is very big and appears to be strong, but as soon as a storm hits, the castle crumbles. We have all heard in recent years that government debt is growing to unsustainable proportions, and if there are not drastic spending cuts in the federal budget then there will be a severe economic crisis sooner than later. As of 2017, the total government debt was $20.2 trillion. According to the dominant economic discourse, government debt is out of control and the cause of all our economic problems. If we can just cut government spending and be fiscally responsible then we can set the economy back on the road to recovery, so they say. In reality, as big as the public debt is, it is merely one component of a much larger, systemic debt problem.\n\nLo and behold, the government isn't the only one in debt here in the U.S. In fact, private household debt is currently around $13.15 trillion, that is, about $7 trillion less than the government debt. Household debt consists of mortgage debt and consumer debt. This is money that Amerikans owe on their homes and on their credit cards. Although household debt is lower than government debt, this is still a massive sum of money and it demonstrates that the debt problem is far bigger than what we are led to believe by the media and Washington.\n\nAnother component of the U.S. debt is the non-financial corporate and business debt, which totals $14.06 trillion. This consists of all the money that non-financial corporations and businesses owe to banks and other creditors. It is significant to note that it is exactly the corporate and business community, the capitalist class, which is yelling the loudest for fiscal responsibility and the curtailment of government debt in the current crisis. These shameless hypocrites claim that the governments' fiscal negligence was the cause of this economic recession, when they are borrowing money on just as large a scale as big brother. The truth is that debt is the main driving force that keeps capitalism alive, and it is so endemic to the system, that the capitalists themselves must assume more and more debt to continue expanding.\n\nFinally, we come to the financial debt, which stands at $13.838 trillion. The financial debt consists of all the money that banks and other financial institutions owe to other banks, financial institutions, or governments. Ironically, it was the bankers and finance capital that were principally responsible for the 2008 economic recession, but they too attempt to lay the blame at the feet of the federal government. It is true that government policy was partially responsible for unleashing the forces of financial speculation that led to the housing bubble and the subsequent credit crisis, but these policies were in fact enthusiastically advocated by the bankers and finance capital, who financed political campaigns to ensure that financial markets could by liberalized and deregulated. In all actuality, the government and finance capital is so intertwined that it is futile to blame one or the other for the financial crisis. Besides, it is silly to blame bloodsucking capitalists and politicians for doing what is necessary for them to make more money and stimulate \"more economic growth,\" the mantra of the day.\n\nNow when all of these components are added up, the total U.S. Debt is an astounding $61.24 trillion. This is more than three times the U.S. GDP. What this means is that the U.S. would have to pay EVERY dollar it produces for three FULL years in order to repay the debt, which of course is impossible. Debt is the lifeblood of not only the U.S. economy, but also the capitalist world economy, and without it, capitalism would have perished a long time ago. But herein lies the dilemma. On the one hand, an economic system based on debt is unsustainable and will eventually go bankrupt. The government and the capitalists know this. On the other hand, debt is absolutely necessary for capitalism to survive. Why debt is essential to capitalism will form the subject of Part 2, but here it should just be said that since the Great Depression of the 1930's, politicians and economists have understood that debt is the necessary stimulant of growth under monopoly capitalism, and they have encouraged people, businesses, as well the federal government, to take out more and more debt in order to finance this increasingly frail sand castle called the capitalist economy.The sheer amount of debt involved in this should be a major indication that something is really wrong with this system, but the charade continues. This is not simply a matter of cutting government spending and being fiscally responsible. In this era of neoliberalism, it is easy to point the finger at big brother and blame the government for spending beyond its means, but the reality is that the debt problem pervades every component of this politico-economic system. If the federal budget were balanced tomorrow, it would have little effect on the overall economy. We have to remember that 80% of all economic activity in the U.S.is based on consumption. That means that four out of every five dollars is spent on consumption, a strong indication of the parasitic nature of the U.S. economy. So this is a system that is based on debt-driven consumption in order to grow. If people were to stop borrowing money, due to the relavtive decline of wages and incomes along with the rise of inflation over the decades, consumption would be drastically curtailed and the economy would spiral into a deep recession, perhaps even collapse.\n\nThe only solution in the current crisis is for the government, indeed for everybody, to go more into debt. Cutting the budget will only throw the system into an immediate economic tailspin. Unfortunately, for the masters of the world, the jig is up. They know that debt-driven growth is not sustainable and that the ultimate outcome is inevitably bankruptcy. Yet they also understand that more debt is the only thing that can prevent the sand castle of capitalism from collapsing right now. I say, let it fall. It needs to fall sometime and there is no better time than the present. No matter what you believe, the system is in a state of protracted decline right now. We better get everything we can and bail before the collapse comes otherwise you might be buried in the sand. ","subreddit":"communism","title":"The Sandcastle and the Coming Storm, Part 1"}

It was a really great speech and made me quite fond of Putin. Then, Putin didn't stop the U.S. from destroying Libya - which was a serious error - but he did learn from it. He admitted it was a mistake in hindsight. So when the U.S. tried to do the same thing in Syria, Russia put a stop to it definitively. Russia also prevented the U.S. from attacking Iran in 2014. He has been opposed to U.S. support of right-wing neonazi movements in Poland, Ukraine and other areas of the former Soviet bloc, yet he is accused of supporting right-wing groups in the U.S. and around the world. He is accused by the West of interfering in electoral processes in the U.S. and Europe (without any proof) and of being an imperialist.

{"author":"Calabar_king","created_utc":1519784048,"num_comments":3,"score":12,"selftext":"The economist and social scientist Theot\u00f4nio dos Santos died at the age of 81 on Tuesday morning, suffering from pancreatic cancer. Santos was one of the main formulators of the Marxist Dependency Theory. The economist was one of Latin America's most influential thinkers in the second half of the twentieth and early twenty-first century, having dozens of works published in various countries on the relationship between capitalism, development, dependency, and imperialism. He also held the position of coordinator of the UNESCO Chair in Global Economy and Sustainable Development, was emeritus professor at the *Fluminense Federal University* (UFF) and a visiting professor at the *State University of Rio de Janeiro* (UERJ).\n\nBorn in Carangola, Minas Gerais, Santos joined the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) in the late 1950s. In 1961, he was one of the founders of the Marxist Revolutionary Organization - Labor Policy (Polop). With a presence in S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas, the group brought together intellectuals and students and aimed to create the conditions for the emergence of a revolutionary workers' party in Brazil. It was at Polop that the then economics student met two life and study partners: V\u00e2nia Bambirra, with whom he would marry, and [Ruy Mauro Marini](http://revistaseletronicas.pucrs.br/ojs/index.php/fass/article/viewFile/27810/15740).\n\n\nThe trio was responsible for formulating the Marxist Dependency Theory and worked together from 1962, when the three assumed professorial positions in the newly created *University of Bras\u00edlia* (UnB) at the invitation of Darcy Ribeiro. In an interview with GLOBO, in 2013, Santos recalled the effervescence that UnB lived in its early years.\n\n&gt;\"The debate was flowing much then, and the university was the center of discussion. Living the impact of everything that happened in the country in Brasilia was very interesting. Darcy brought an initial team and we were inviting others. Victor Nunes Leal, a member of the Federal Supreme Court, was director of the Department of Political Science. Oscar Niemeyer walked the campus with the students of Architecture\" - Santos said.\n\n**CRITICS TO ECLAC**\n\nThe Marxist Dependency Theory - developed by Santos, V\u00e2nia and Marini together with the American economist Andre Gunder Frank - was opposed to the theory of dependence formulated in the framework of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), based in Santiago de Chile and an influential center of structuralist thinking in the region. The ECLAC saw an opposition between a feudal and agrarian Brazil and a modern and industrial Brazil. The overcoming of underdevelopment would then pass through an alliance between the state and the industrial national bourgeoisie in the form of a nationalist and capitalist revolution.\n\nMarxists, however, harshly criticized this opposition between archaic and modern and the idea that there would be stages in development. For Santos and his colleagues, Brazil was not a feudal country, since it was integrated with the world capitalist system as a major supplier of raw materials. The very existence of an industrial national bourgeoisie was questioned. In critics to ECLAC, the group agreed with the interpretation of the dependence of the S\u00e3o Paulo sociological school, which centered around Florestan Fernandes, in the *University of S\u00e3o Paulo* (USP), names such as Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Francisco de Oliveira.\n\nUnB's experience did not last long. Shortly after the 1964 coup, Santos knew he was in the military's sights and went underground with his wife, V\u00e2nia. The couple's daughter was born in that period. The economist was sentenced to 15 years in prison in Minas Gerais, and the political situation worsened amid internal disputes by Polop. The militants of the organization gave rise to two guerrilla groups fighting against the dictatorship: the *Popular Revolutionary Vanguard* (VPR) and the *National Liberation Command* (Colina).\n\n**EXILE IN CHILE**\n\nSantos and his family opted for exile and arrived in Chile in 1966. At that time, the Latin American neighbor had already received many Brazilian intellectuals persecuted by the regime, such as former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. In addition, several left-wing activists from various parts of the world came to Santiago, energizing their universities and research centers. Santos recalled these meetings in the same interview with GLOBO:\n\n&gt;It was a moment of re-discussion of Marxism. The seminars on \"Capital\" multiplied. Suddenly you went to the Faculty of Architecture and they were reading \"Capital\", went to the *Institute of Mathematics* and were reading \"Capital\" - said the economist. - In Chile were the deputy ministers who had worked with Che Guevara in Cuba, had a group from Poland of great quality. Ruy Mauro (Marini), who was in Mexico, comes to Chile as well. He had a Central American economics group led by Rick Lambert.\n\nThis cauldron boiled with the victory of Salvador Allende in 1970. Santos had actively participated in the debates and formulations of Popular Unity, a broad coalition of leftist forces that supported Allende, who eventually adopted the formulations of the Marxist Dependency Theory. Several cadres from the *University of Chile*, where the economist taught, were recruited to the Allende government, and Professor Santos took command of the *Center for Socioeconomic Studies* (Ceso).\n\nThe coup commanded by General Augusto Pinochet, on September 11, 1973, forced Santos to a new exile. The first stop was the Embassy of Panama in Santiago. In a few days, the small house housed hundreds of persecuted politicians. It was six months before the economist got permission to travel. V\u00e2nia and her daughter were already in Mexico with Marini. His idea was to go to Germany from Mexico, but with proposals of work for him and his wife at the *National Autonomous University of Mexico* (UNAM), he ended up staying in the Latin American country.\n\nThe end of the experience of Chilean socialism also weakened the diffusion of his works in Brazil. Through the group's connection to Allende, Marxist Dependency Theory itself became marginalized as part of a failed experiment. At the same time, it became hegemonic in Brazil the interpretation of the sociological school of S\u00e3o Paulo, presented in the book \"Dependence and development in Latin America\", by Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Enzo Faletto, 1970.\n\n&gt;Our group penetrated strongly in the Chilean left parties. The Popular Unity has taken our perspective. This was also one of the reasons for the strengthening of Fernando Henrique's interpretation. The fall of Allende in 1973 is transformed into a failure of our vision, as if we had radicalized the government and made it unfeasible, Santos said in 2013.\n\n**RETURN TO BRAZIL**\n\nThe return to Brazil only happened in 1979, after the amnesty. Hope, however, gave way to frustration. The spaces in the academy were closed for them. In spite of the persecution of the dictatorship, Santos was not able to be reinstated and presented a contest again to the *Federal University of Minas Gerais* (UFMG). He did not hide his disappointment about the country he encountered after more than a decade of exile.\n\nEven with all the difficulties, the economist continued to work intensely. Together with Immanuel Wallerstein, Giovanni Arrighi and Samir Amin, he contributed to the formulation of the world-system theory, which proposed the articulation of economics, geopolitics and international relations to think about the interrelationships between societies, economies and globalized capitalism.\n\nThe body of the teacher will be veiled this Wednesday, from 10 am to 2 pm, in the City Hall of Rio de Janeiro, in Cinel\u00e2ndia. Afterwards, the cremation will be held at the Carmo Memorial, in Caju. Theot\u00f4nio dos Santos left his wife, teacher Monica Bruckmann, and four children: Micaela and Camila Bruckmann and N\u00e1dia and Ivan Bambirra, from their first marriage to V\u00e2nia Bambirra.\n\nOriginal news: https://oglobo.globo.com/economia/morre-economista-theotonio-dos-santos-aos-81-anos-22437651","subreddit":"communism","title":"In memory of comrade Theot\u00f4nio dos Santos - Hasta la victoria, siempre!"}
