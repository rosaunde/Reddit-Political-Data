As well as his much-recognised friendship with actual Physical nazi Heinrich Harrer. \n\nFirst of all the notion that Buddhism is an inherently an eternally peaceful ideology is nonsense, as the rule of the Dalai Lama, henceforth DL, is slated for an end during the culmination of the current procession of the universal wheel, whereby a being will descend from Heaven and obliterate all non-believers, with an emphasis on Muslims, who it refers to as 'barbarians'. \n\nBut this post is not about Buddhism at all, in fact, many comrades are Buddhist and I have the utmost love and respect for all comrades and acknowledge the power of religion in safeguarding the general status of individuals in times of crisis as well as their aversion to money and love of the poor. \n\nIt is instead about the Dalai Lama, and his kingdom. \n\nTibet is a region to the west of China that consists in its near entirety of white-tipped mountains forming the highest range in the world. Nestled in the highest regions of that range, is Lhasa, its capital. \n\nFor a prominent portion of its history, Tibet was under Chinese rule, passing from emperor to emperor and witnessing varying levels of autonomy, until the Xinhai revolution in 1912.\n\nBefore that, it experienced a minor rebellion in 1905 after [Christian missionaries entered Tibet, seeking new converts. This rebellion was quickly crushed by the ruling Qing Dynasty](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1905_Tibetan_Rebellion)\n\n\nIt declared its independence in 1913, Citing vast ethnic and cultural differences. It also incorporated, without warning or witness, the province of Xikang into its territory, sparking the Sino-Tibetan war. Kuomintang official [Tang Kesan immediately sent about trying to work out an end to fighting](https:\/\/books.google.ie\/books?id=ak3SQTVS7acC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=tang+kesan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VH2uTNivA8P48AbSs8DqBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tang%20kesan&amp;f=false)\n\nOther officials in the Kuomintang immediately broke the ceasefires, due to fear of political motivations from rivals. And they rapidly crushed the Tibetan forces.\n\n[Over the next few years the Tibetans repeatedly attacked the Kuomintang forces, but were defeated several times.](https:\/\/books.google.ie\/books?id=Nm5wAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ma+pu-fang+egypt&amp;dq=ma+pu-fang+egypt&amp;redir_esc=y) In 1932 Tibet made the decision to expand the war into Qinghai against Muslim leader Ma Bufang, the reasons for which have speculated upon by many historians. My personal opinion is that they believed it would spark the war between the Buddhists and Muslims that would signal the arrival of the being from heaven who would vanquish all Non-believers. \n\nThe Tibetans expanded to Yushu and Qinghai and now heavily outnumbered the local forces, numbering an estimated 3,000. Repeated Tibetan attacks were repulsed by the local Qinghai forces--even though they were as mentioned outnumbered--since the Tibetans were poorly prepared for war, and so they suffered heavier casualties than the Qinghai army.\n\nThe Tibetan forces [raped and murdered many nuns, locals, prisoners and invalid they could find, as well as embarked on a destructive campaign of looting and burning whole villages.](https:\/\/escholarship.org\/content\/qt1qf0664z\/qt1qf0664z.pdf) In return, the Qinghai forces executed Tibetan prisoners, burned monasteries, and had the civilians pay them for assisting Tibetans. \n\nA further regrouping of the Tibetans failed and they lost control of Xikang and were pushed by across the Jinsha river. There, several Tibetan generals surrendered, the Dalai Lama at the time [demoted them](https:\/\/books.google.ie\/books?id=Q7MKAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Dalai+Lama+telegraphed+the+Government+of+India+asking+for+diplomatic+assistance&amp;q=Dalai+Lama+telegraphed+the+Government+of+India+asking+for+help&amp;redir_esc=y)\n\nLosing so much territory in so little time caused the Tibetans to panic. They immediately asked the [British for assistance, in the form of funds, and arms which the British gave. The Indians gave some armaments as well.](https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/24442792)\n\nBy 1933, the Tibetans had suffered such historic defeats that[ they negotiated a surrendered](https:\/\/books.google.ie\/books?id=YD0sAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=ma+bufang+liu+wenhui&amp;q=ma+bufang&amp;redir_esc=y)\n\nAfter the Communist victory in the Chinese civil war, the Communist party of China signed an agreement referred to as [the seventeen point agreement with the delegates of the Dalai Lama, who at this point, is the current Dalai Lama that you know well](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seventeen_Point_Agreement_for_the_Peaceful_Liberation_of_Tibet), which eased Chinese territorial fears and gave Tibet autonomy.\n\n\nThe DL sent a letter agreeing to the settlement: [\"\"The Tibet Local Government as well as the ecclesiastic and secular people unanimously support this agreement, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, will actively support the People's Liberation Army in Tibet to consolidate national defence, drive out imperialist influences from Tibet and safeguard the unification of the territory and the sovereignty of the Motherland.\"\"](https:\/\/books.google.ie\/books?id=WWjMMS7dHc0C&amp;pg=PT197&amp;lpg=PT197&amp;dq=%22The+Tibet+Local+Government+as+well+as+the+ecclesiastic+and+secular+people+unanimously+support+this+agreement,+and+under+the+leadership+of+Chairman+Mao+and+the+Central+People%27s+Government,+will+actively+support+the+People%27s+Liberation+Army+in+Tibet+to+consolidate+national+defence,+drive+out+imperialist+influences+from+Tibet+and+safeguard+the+unification+of+the+territory+and+the+sovereignty+of+the+Motherland.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3dgKXsZv21&amp;sig=P_Lu9SsN8ZdWg02mtFnPV37JDmw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjzm8PB6-XdAhXKJsAKHX07AJsQ6AEwA3oECAcQAQ)\n\nThe Panchen Lama also agreed (Ibid.)\n\nThe Tibetan government in exile refuses to acknowledge this signing and some of their older members who were delegates never signed the agreement. But the Tibetan national assembly asked the government to accept the agreement and [stated that it would send its own radio confirmation later](http:\/\/www.tibet.net\/en\/index.php?id=183&amp;rmenuid=11)\n\nToday, the Tibetan government in exile claims that the Chinese authorities at the meeting forced the Tibetans to sign and used forged Tibetan stamps whenever the Tibetans refused to sign. \n\nHowever, Melvyn Goldstein, who interviewed at least two negotiators and the only interpreter (the Dalai Lama's brother-in-law) from the Tibetan side states: [\"The Chinese did make new seals for the Tibetans, but these were just personal seals with each delegate's name carved on them. Other than this, there were no forged government seals....In his autobiography, the Dalai Lama states that the Tibetan delegates claimed they were forced 'under duress' to sign the agreement...\nTheir feeling of duress derives from the general Chinese threat to use military force again in Central Tibet if an agreement was not concluded. However, according to international law, this does not invalidate an agreement. So long as there is no physical violence against the signatories, an agreement is valid....However, the deal requires full agreement...

As well as his much-recognised friendship with actual Physical nazi Heinrich Harrer. \n\nFirst of all the notion that Buddhism is an inherently an eternally peaceful ideology is nonsense, as the rule of the Dalai Lama, henceforth DL, is slated for an end during the culmination of the current procession of the universal wheel, whereby a being will descend from Heaven and obliterate all non-believers, with an emphasis on Muslims, who it refers to as 'barbarians'. \n\nBut this post is not about Buddhism at all, in fact, many comrades are Buddhist and I have the utmost love and respect for all comrades and acknowledge the power of religion in safeguarding the general status of individuals in times of crisis as well as their aversion to money and love of the poor. \n\nIt is instead about the Dalai Lama, and his kingdom. \n\nTibet is a region to the west of China that consists in its near entirety of white-tipped mountains forming the highest range in the world. Nestled in the highest regions of that range, is Lhasa, its capital. \n\nFor a prominent portion of its history, Tibet was under Chinese rule, passing from emperor to emperor and witnessing varying levels of autonomy, until the Xinhai revolution in 1912.\n\nBefore that, it experienced a minor rebellion in 1905 after [Christian missionaries entered Tibet, seeking new converts. This rebellion was quickly crushed by the ruling Qing Dynasty](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1905_Tibetan_Rebellion)\n\n\nIt declared its independence in 1913, Citing vast ethnic and cultural differences. It also incorporated, without warning or witness, the province of Xikang into its territory, sparking the Sino-Tibetan war. Kuomintang official [Tang Kesan immediately sent about trying to work out an end to fighting](https:\/\/books.google.ie\/books?id=ak3SQTVS7acC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=tang+kesan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VH2uTNivA8P48AbSs8DqBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tang%20kesan&amp;f=false)\n\nOther officials in the Kuomintang immediately broke the ceasefires, due to fear of political motivations from rivals. And they rapidly crushed the Tibetan forces.\n\n[Over the next few years the Tibetans repeatedly attacked the Kuomintang forces, but were defeated several times.](https:\/\/books.google.ie\/books?id=Nm5wAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ma+pu-fang+egypt&amp;dq=ma+pu-fang+egypt&amp;redir_esc=y) In 1932 Tibet made the decision to expand the war into Qinghai against Muslim leader Ma Bufang, the reasons for which have speculated upon by many historians. My personal opinion is that they believed it would spark the war between the Buddhists and Muslims that would signal the arrival of the being from heaven who would vanquish all Non-believers. \n\nThe Tibetans expanded to Yushu and Qinghai and now heavily outnumbered the local forces, numbering an estimated 3,000. Repeated Tibetan attacks were repulsed by the local Qinghai forces--even though they were as mentioned outnumbered--since the Tibetans were poorly prepared for war, and so they suffered heavier casualties than the Qinghai army.\n\nThe Tibetan forces [raped and murdered many nuns, locals, prisoners and invalid they could find, as well as embarked on a destructive campaign of looting and burning whole villages.](https:\/\/escholarship.org\/content\/qt1qf0664z\/qt1qf0664z.pdf) In return, the Qinghai forces executed Tibetan prisoners, burned monasteries, and had the civilians pay them for assisting Tibetans. \n\nA further regrouping of the Tibetans failed and they lost control of Xikang and were pushed by across the Jinsha river. There, several Tibetan generals surrendered, the Dalai Lama at the time [demoted them](https:\/\/books.google.ie\/books?id=Q7MKAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Dalai+Lama+telegraphed+the+Government+of+India+asking+for+diplomatic+assistance&amp;q=Dalai+Lama+telegraphed+the+Government+of+India+asking+for+help&amp;redir_esc=y)\n\nLosing so much territory in so little time caused the Tibetans to panic.

But the Tibetan national assembly asked the government to accept the agreement and [stated that it would send its own radio confirmation later](http:\/\/www.tibet.net\/en\/index.php?id=183&amp;rmenuid=11)\n\nToday, the Tibetan government in exile claims that the Chinese authorities at the meeting forced the Tibetans to sign and used forged Tibetan stamps whenever the Tibetans refused to sign. \n\nHowever, Melvyn Goldstein, who interviewed at least two negotiators and the only interpreter (the Dalai Lama's brother-in-law) from the Tibetan side states: [\"The Chinese did make new seals for the Tibetans, but these were just personal seals with each delegate's name carved on them. Other than this, there were no forged government seals....In his autobiography, the Dalai Lama states that the Tibetan delegates claimed they were forced 'under duress' to sign the agreement...\nTheir feeling of duress derives from the general Chinese threat to use military force again in Central Tibet if an agreement was not concluded.

Kelle, from the book \u201c*Philosophy in the USSR: Problems of Dialectical Materialism*\u201d. You can find a link to the work [here](https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/PhilosophyInTheUSSRProblemsOdDialecticalMaterialism) The essay is 11 pages long and it starts on page 258. \n\n\u201cBourgeois sociologists and revisionists go out of their way to refute the Leninist conception of scientific ideology by placing ideology in direct opposition to science and denying the very possibility of a scientific ideology.\n\n[The] general tendency to interpret ideology as a distorted consciousness, an interpretation which prevails in bourgeois literature and is repeated by various authors in a variety of ways. This trend goes back to the 1920s, and particularly to the work of Karl Mannheim, who demanded that the methods of \"the criticism of ideology\" should be applied to Marxist theory itself. Mannheim's work exercised a great influence on the approach that was taken to the problem of the theory of ideology in bourgeois philosophy and laid down the basic lines of criticism of Marxism as an ideology.\n\nRevisionist literature, following this kind of interpretation of ideology, tries to \"save\" Marxism by declaring that it is not an ideology at all. \"Marxism is not an ideology. Marxism is a philosophy and a science,\" writes Ernst Fischer. Such a contrasting of ideology, philosophy and science, and also the allegation that making Marxism into an ideology entails the distortion of its intellectual nature clearly contradicts the Leninist interpretation of this problem.\n\nSo the different interpretations of ideology are not merely academic. They reflect the class and social position of the various theoreticians and their relationship to the revolutionary movement, to Marxist-Leninist theory. Their understanding of the concept of ideology directly or indirectly reflects their acknowledgement, denial or distortion of Marxism-Leninism. Here, in brief, we have the ideological-theoretical setting of the problem. In our view the problem of the nature of scientific ideology can be correctly stated and solved by opposing it to illusory ideology. Although both the one and the other are ideologies, the mechanisms of their formation, distribution and influence on social life, not to mention their theoretical content, are of distinctly different quality.\n\nThe most profound analysis of the essence and specific features of the ideological process in a society torn by class antagonisms was provided by the founders of Marxism, who thus gave us the basis for a theory of ideology. Their analysis fully retains its theoretical significance today. Marx and Engels regarded ideology as illusory consciousness, but their views of ideology differ fundamentally from the interpretation of ideology that is current in contemporary bourgeois literature. What is more, the bourgeois theoreticians ignore the fact that the Marxist concept of ideology was developed in the works of Lenin and has since been interpreted in a wider sense. It has been shown that it is possible to take a scientific or unscientific approach within the framework of the phenomenon of ideology itself. In this essay we shall try to examine the extension of the concept of ideology and the objective grounds for a scientific ideology as a substantiation of Lenin's conception.\u201d\n","subreddit":"communism","title":"Excerpts from the introduction to \u201cIdeology as a Phenomenon of Social Consciousness\" by V.Z.

In October the 1st, hundreds communists, revolutionaries, friends and family gathered in his funeral to honor him. Thousands all over Greece are filled with sorrow and have taken to the social media to share stories about Tassos.\n\nTassos was born in 1955 in a working class family. As a teenager he started reading on Marxism and a few years later, in 1973, he participated, as a young student, in the [Athens Polytechnic Uprising](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Athens_Polytechnic_uprising) against the dictatorship that ruled in Greece since 1967. Tassos wrote about himself \u201cI crossed the gates of the Polytechnic and I think I forgot to come out again\u201d. Thus began his participation in the revolutionary movement and the extra-parliamentary Left in Greece which spanned over 4 decades. Three years later, in 1977, Tassos , along with three of his comrades from the communist group \u201cThe Militant\u201d was put into trial for his actions. In front of his judges he claimed that \u201cno matter what you do, I and my comrades will not stop fighting until the red flag of socialism-communism has embraced Greece and all of the world\u201d. After the social democrats (PASOK) came into power, Tassos remained in the popular movement, fighting for the rights of the workers. During 1981-82 he played a major in the establishment of committees of soldiers which promoted the right to trade-unionism within the army.  In 1985, when police forces shot and  killed the 15 years old Michalis Kaltezas, Tassos crossed the gates of Polytechnic School once again, as a member of the co-coordinating committee of a new occupation. In 1990, when \u201cThe Militant\u201d ceased its actions, Tassos joined New Left Current (NAR), a group of communists that had recently split from the Communist Party of Greece (KKE). Throughout the \u201890s, in a dire period for revolutionaries throughout the world, Tassos promoted the unity of revolutionary forces, as he had done throughout his life. Political fronts of the anticapitalist Left were formed and Tassos contributed in all of them, with the most important one being ANTARSYA, which was founded in 2009, right after the revolt of December 2008 against the assassination of Alexis Grigoropoulos by police forces. Tassos was a founding member and one of its leaders. All the tendencies and organizations among the Left in Greece recognized his contribution, his revolutionary spirit, his optimism and resolution in the communist ideas but also his humor and friendliness, especially towards the younger comrades. Tassos remained close to the youth movement; he was present in student demonstrations, supporting the young militants against the repression of the state. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Young Tasso speaking in public against the dictatorship](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/cxtl1pin2up11.jpg)\n\nThroughout his life, Tassos held the ideals of revolution, without succumbing to sectarian politics. He always stressed the need for a broad alliance of left and radical organizations, without promoting electoralism or a right-wing turn. Always critical of the reformist subordination to the ruling class, he remained a  true revolutionary to the end.  Tassos embodied the best aspects of the revolutionary movement of Greece. \n\nTassos, we will never forget you...\n\nAs you so often said, VENCEREMOS!!!

Moreover, I would examine, both ruthlessly and critically, any that attempt to claim said \"limitations\".\n\nHere is an excerpt from \"*The Fundamentals of Marxist-Leninist Philosophy*\", 1974, by F.V. Konstantinov, translated from Russian by Robert Daglish, published by Progress Publishers in the USSR, from Chapter V: The Universal Dialectical Laws of Development; Section One: Materialist Dialectics as the Science of the Universal Connection and Development that speaks to the folly of such claims:\n\n\u201cChapter V: THE UNIVERSAL DIALECTICAL LAWS OF DEVELOPMENT \n\nDialectics, the most complete, comprehensive and profound theory of development, is the heart and soul of Marxism-Leninism, its theoretical foundation. The universal laws of dialectics reveal the essential features of any developing phenomenon, no matter to what field of activity it may belong. \n\nSection One: Materialist Dialectics as the Science of the Universal Connection and Development \n\nThe modern scientific world outlook is firmly based on the principle of motion, change and development as the universal fundamental principle of all being and knowledge. This principle has had to assert itself throughout the history of human thought in opposition to various metaphysical concepts. \n\nMaterialist dialectics was born of the generalization of scientific achievements and also of mankind\u2019s historical experience, which showed that social life and human consciousness, like nature itself, are in a state of constant change and development. Accordingly dialectics is defined in Marxist-Leninist philosophy as the science \u201cof the general laws of motion and development of nature, human society and thought\u201d,1 as \u201c...the doctrine of development in its fullest,deepest and most comprehensive form, the doctrine of the relativity of the human knowledge that provides us with a reflection of eternally developing matter\u201d.2\n\nThe concept of development cannot be understood without the concepts of the connection and interdependence, the interaction of phenomena. No motion would be possible without this connection and interaction between different objects, or between the various aspects and elements within each object. This is why Engels calls dialectics also \u201cthe science of universal inter-connection\u201d.3 Lenin, in his article \u201cKarl Marx\u201d, characterized the most essential features of dialectics, particularly emphasizing \u201cthe interdependence and the closest and indissoluble connection between all aspects of any phenomenon (history constantly revealing ever new aspects), a connection that provides a uniform, and universal process of motion, one that follows definite laws...\u201d.4 \n\nThe world knows no absolutely isolated phenomena; all are conditioned by some other phenomena. Of course, in the process of gaining knowledge we may isolate an object from its general connections for a time in order to study it. But sooner or later the logic of research demands that we restore this connection; otherwise it is impossible to arrive at a true notion of what the object is.\n\nThe general, universal connection and interaction of phenomena and processes must find its reflection in the interconnection of human concepts. Only in this case can man know the world in its unity and motion. The scientific concept or system of concepts formed by man in the process of cognition is nothing but a reflection of the internal connection of phenomena and processes. \n\nA law is a form of universality . Knowledge of laws allows us to conceive of the vast and varied world in its unity and wholeness. \u201c...The concept of law is one of the stages of the cognition by man of unity and connection, of the reciprocal dependence and totality of the world process.\u201d5 \n\nWith a knowledge of the laws of nature and society people are able to act consciously, to foresee certain events, to transform the objects of nature and their properties to their advantage and purposefully change the social conditions of their life. \u201cOnce the interconnection is grasped, all theoretical belief in the permanent necessity of existing conditions collapses before their collapse in practised.\u201d6 \n\nIt is no accident therefore that the dialectical theory that nature and society develop according to certain laws is attacked by the opponents of reliable scientific knowledge and also by people who have a stake in perpetuating an obsolete social order. \n\nLet us consider the basic types of objective laws. They can be divided into three main groups: (1) particular laws expressing the relationships between the specific properties of objects or between processes within the framework of one or another form of motion; (2) general laws applying to large groups of objects and phenomena; and (3) universal laws. The first kind of laws is manifested in specific conditions and has an extremely limited sphere of application. The laws in the second group express the connection between comparatively common properties of a large number of qualitatively different material objects, and between recurrent phenomena. Here, for example, we find the laws of the conservation of mass, energy, charge, and quantity of movement in physics, and the law of natural selection in biology. The laws in the third group express the universal dialectical relations between all existing phenomena and their properties, and the tendencies of matter to change. Besides its qualitative diversity matter has a certain internal unity which shows itself in the universal connection and interdependence of all phenomena, in the historical development and conversion of some forms of matter into others. This unity is expressed in universal laws. \n\nAs a philosophical science, dialectics is concerned with universal laws . \n\nThe laws of dialectics operate everywhere, embracing all aspects of reality. They are laws of nature, society and thought. They therefore have a universal cognitive and methodological significance, which means that dialectics is a method applicable not only to one field of knowledge, but is the universal method of man's cognitive activity. Dialectics is important because it shows us the correct approach to reality, but this approach can be made only through concrete study of phenomena. \n\nThe universal laws of development are evolved by dialectics as laws of existence and laws of knowledge. In their essence they form a unity, and without such unity there can be no true knowledge or thought. Dialectics is therefore not only a doctrine concerning the laws of the development of being; it is also a theory of knowledge, logic, that is, a doctrine concerning the forms and laws of thinking. \n\nWhile possessing objective content, the laws of dialectics are at the same time steps in cognition, logical forms of the reflection of reality.\u201d - The Fundamentals of Marxist-Leninist Philosophy, 1974, by F.V.

What follows is very cis-heteronormative so I apologize in advance. The GDR were more advanced on Trans and gay issues as well but that's for another post.\n\nI was listening to \"The Antifada\" when they mentioned that there were studies that showed the people behind the iron curtain were more satisfied with their sex lives and overall had better sex then their counterparts in the west. That statement goes counter to the popular (western) imagination of soviet\/warsaw pact life. I had to investigate. \n\nThe fall of the Berlin wall gave sociologist a great opportunity to comparative study the effects policy has on a society, since the GDR and FRG basically had the same people and material conditions post WWII but diverged in ideology. Most of the sexual research was done in response to the Wende and German unification. The results are quite surprising. So let's get to the sexy stuff.\n\nIn the liberal U.S. media there's regular coverage of [the Orgasm gap](https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/stress-and-sex\/201510\/the-orgasm-gap-simple-truth-sexual-solutions). \n\n&gt;In one study examining about 800 college students, a **52% orgasm gap** was found. That is, **39 percent of women and 91 percent of men** said that they usually or always experienced orgasm in partnered sex. [...] another study with 15,000 college students found that the orgasm gap is larger in hookup sex than in relationship sex. Still, in college student committed relationships, there is still a **17% orgasm gap**. [...] in a survey of about 3,000 single women and men in the U.S. ranging from 18 to 65 years old. When having sex with a familiar partner, **women said they have an orgasm 63% of the time; men said 85%** of the time.\n\nAn orgasm gap of between 17%-52%. Much equality. There are myriad reasons for the gap that most here will be aware of (pls don't call the police) but I never read any feminist text that incorporated capitalism in the analysis or looked at how things were in the communist bloc. \n\nA comparative study of student attitudes and experiences revealed that \n\n&gt;**74 percent of Eastern males and 75 percent of Eastern females** felt that their most recent coitus was sexually satisfying, compared to **84 percent of West German males but only 46 percent of West German females.** While 76 percent of Eastern males and 82 percent of Eastern females claimed to be \"happy\" after sex, only 71 percent of Western males and 52 percent of Western females could say the same.\n\nand a survey conducted by the GEWIS-Institute (it's an acronym), Hamburg found that\n\n&gt; 80 percent of Eastern women experienced orgasm, compared to 63 percent of women in the West. \n\nThis discrepancy has its origins in ideology. Female emancipation and gender equality were stated and actively pursued by the socialist state and central to socialism (90% of GDR women were in the labour force compared to 46% in FRG at the time of unification). That included sexual pleasure. \n\n&gt; \"Communism will not bring asceticism, but joy of life, power of life, and a satisfied love life will help to do that. But in my opinion the present widespread hypertrophy in sexual matters does not give joy and force to life, but takes it away. In the age of revolution that is bad, very bad.\" \n\n- Lenin in letters to Clara Zetkin\n\nCumming is not bourgeois but marxist. Take that you anti-Leninists. \n\nBecause the church and capitalist relation were less of a concern in the GDR, Sex-Ed was a rational issue and was approached scientifically, one might even say scientific socialist-ly. Sex-Ed became part of the curriculum earlier in the GDR and with time became more comprehensive. The female orgasm became a matter of research as early as the 50s in the eastern bloc. Compare that with how we keep rediscovering the clitoris every 15 years now. In 1970, the Sex-Ed book \"Mann und Frau intim\" by GDR sexologist Siegfried Schnabl was published, emphasizing the difference in sexual arousal patterns between the sexes and advising men that most women only orgasm through clitoral stimulation not penetration. Schnabel also advocated for homosexuality as a normal orientation.\n\nEast Germans weren't just better in the sack but communist sexologiysts approach sexuality in a much more holistic way. They recognized that the stimulation can be as good as it gets but no one will have fun if they are worried about money or housework. They encouraged equal participation in housework and as part of the emancipatory ideology the state had policy that made life for single mothers easier and guaranteed financial independence for women, regardless of marital status. Divorce and abortion laws were decades ahead of the West and access to contraception was free. As the GDR was giving the pill for free, the FRG had a years long society dialogue about it. All this has the effect of decentering male sexuality and male orgasm and making sex a collaborative act that every participant should enjoy.\n\nBy the mid 80s 15% of women in the GDR said they rarely or never reached orgasm regularly, compared to 50% in 1972. These are numbers you only find in lesbian couples today. \n\nI'll leave you with this. In a survey conducted in 1991 of East Germans about what they think of the West one female respondent wrote across her questionnaire:\n\n&gt;\"We've missed out on nothing from over there, nothing.\" \n\nWhat do y'all think?\n\nSources: \n\n[1] Sharp, Ingrid; \"The Sexual Unification of Germany\"; *Journal of the History of Sexuality*, Vol. 13, Nr. 3, July 2004.

Marxism is a philosophy and a science,\" writes Ernst Fischer. Such a contrasting of ideology, philosophy and science, and also the allegation that making Marxism into an ideology entails the distortion of its intellectual nature clearly contradicts the Leninist interpretation of this problem.\n\nSo the different interpretations of ideology are not merely academic. They reflect the class and social position of the various theoreticians and their relationship to the revolutionary movement, to Marxist-Leninist theory. Their understanding of the concept of ideology directly or indirectly reflects their acknowledgement, denial or distortion of Marxism-Leninism. Here, in brief, we have the ideological-theoretical setting of the problem. In our view the problem of the nature of scientific ideology can be correctly stated and solved by opposing it to illusory ideology. Although both the one and the other are ideologies, the mechanisms of their formation, distribution and influence on social life, not to mention their theoretical content, are of distinctly different quality.\n\nThe most profound analysis of the essence and specific features of the ideological process in a society torn by class antagonisms was provided by the founders of Marxism, who thus gave us the basis for a theory of ideology. Their analysis fully retains its theoretical significance today. Marx and Engels regarded ideology as illusory consciousness, but their views of ideology differ fundamentally from the interpretation of ideology that is current in contemporary bourgeois literature. What is more, the bourgeois theoreticians ignore the fact that the Marxist concept of ideology was developed in the works of Lenin and has since been interpreted in a wider sense. It has been shown that it is possible to take a scientific or unscientific approach within the framework of the phenomenon of ideology itself. In this essay we shall try to examine the extension of the concept of ideology and the objective grounds for a scientific ideology as a substantiation of Lenin's conception.\u201d\n","subreddit":"communism","title":"Excerpts from the introduction to \u201cIdeology as a Phenomenon of Social Consciousness\" by V.Z.

Moreover, I would examine, both ruthlessly and critically, any that attempt to claim said \"limitations\".\n\nHere is an excerpt from \"*The Fundamentals of Marxist-Leninist Philosophy*\", 1974, by F.V. Konstantinov, translated from Russian by Robert Daglish, published by Progress Publishers in the USSR, from Chapter V: The Universal Dialectical Laws of Development; Section One: Materialist Dialectics as the Science of the Universal Connection and Development that speaks to the folly of such claims:\n\n\u201cChapter V: THE UNIVERSAL DIALECTICAL LAWS OF DEVELOPMENT \n\nDialectics, the most complete, comprehensive and profound theory of development, is the heart and soul of Marxism-Leninism, its theoretical foundation. The universal laws of dialectics reveal the essential features of any developing phenomenon, no matter to what field of activity it may belong. \n\nSection One: Materialist Dialectics as the Science of the Universal Connection and Development \n\nThe modern scientific world outlook is firmly based on the principle of motion, change and development as the universal fundamental principle of all being and knowledge. This principle has had to assert itself throughout the history of human thought in opposition to various metaphysical concepts. \n\nMaterialist dialectics was born of the generalization of scientific achievements and also of mankind\u2019s historical experience, which showed that social life and human consciousness, like nature itself, are in a state of constant change and development. Accordingly dialectics is defined in Marxist-Leninist philosophy as the science \u201cof the general laws of motion and development of nature, human society and thought\u201d,1 as \u201c...the doctrine of development in its fullest,deepest and most comprehensive form, the doctrine of the relativity of the human knowledge that provides us with a reflection of eternally developing matter\u201d.2\n\nThe concept of development cannot be understood without the concepts of the connection and interdependence, the interaction of phenomena. No motion would be possible without this connection and interaction between different objects, or between the various aspects and elements within each object. This is why Engels calls dialectics also \u201cthe science of universal inter-connection\u201d.3 Lenin, in his article \u201cKarl Marx\u201d, characterized the most essential features of dialectics, particularly emphasizing \u201cthe interdependence and the closest and indissoluble connection between all aspects of any phenomenon (history constantly revealing ever new aspects), a connection that provides a uniform, and universal process of motion, one that follows definite laws...\u201d.4 \n\nThe world knows no absolutely isolated phenomena; all are conditioned by some other phenomena. Of course, in the process of gaining knowledge we may isolate an object from its general connections for a time in order to study it. But sooner or later the logic of research demands that we restore this connection; otherwise it is impossible to arrive at a true notion of what the object is.\n\nThe general, universal connection and interaction of phenomena and processes must find its reflection in the interconnection of human concepts. Only in this case can man know the world in its unity and motion. The scientific concept or system of concepts formed by man in the process of cognition is nothing but a reflection of the internal connection of phenomena and processes. \n\nA law is a form of universality . Knowledge of laws allows us to conceive of the vast and varied world in its unity and wholeness. \u201c...The concept of law is one of the stages of the cognition by man of unity and connection, of the reciprocal dependence and totality of the world process.\u201d5 \n\nWith a knowledge of the laws of nature and society people are able to act consciously, to foresee certain events, to transform the objects of nature and their properties to their advantage and purposefully change the social conditions of their life. \u201cOnce the interconnection is grasped, all theoretical belief in the permanent necessity of existing conditions collapses before their collapse in practised.\u201d6 \n\nIt is no accident therefore that the dialectical theory that nature and society develop according to certain laws is attacked by the opponents of reliable scientific knowledge and also by people who have a stake in perpetuating an obsolete social order. \n\nLet us consider the basic types of objective laws. They can be divided into three main groups: (1) particular laws expressing the relationships between the specific properties of objects or between processes within the framework of one or another form of motion; (2) general laws applying to large groups of objects and phenomena; and (3) universal laws. The first kind of laws is manifested in specific conditions and has an extremely limited sphere of application. The laws in the second group express the connection between comparatively common properties of a large number of qualitatively different material objects, and between recurrent phenomena. Here, for example, we find the laws of the conservation of mass, energy, charge, and quantity of movement in physics, and the law of natural selection in biology. The laws in the third group express the universal dialectical relations between all existing phenomena and their properties, and the tendencies of matter to change. Besides its qualitative diversity matter has a certain internal unity which shows itself in the universal connection and interdependence of all phenomena, in the historical development and conversion of some forms of matter into others. This unity is expressed in universal laws. \n\nAs a philosophical science, dialectics is concerned with universal laws . \n\nThe laws of dialectics operate everywhere, embracing all aspects of reality. They are laws of nature, society and thought. They therefore have a universal cognitive and methodological significance, which means that dialectics is a method applicable not only to one field of knowledge, but is the universal method of man's cognitive activity. Dialectics is important because it shows us the correct approach to reality, but this approach can be made only through concrete study of phenomena. \n\nThe universal laws of development are evolved by dialectics as laws of existence and laws of knowledge. In their essence they form a unity, and without such unity there can be no true knowledge or thought. Dialectics is therefore not only a doctrine concerning the laws of the development of being; it is also a theory of knowledge, logic, that is, a doctrine concerning the forms and laws of thinking. \n\nWhile possessing objective content, the laws of dialectics are at the same time steps in cognition, logical forms of the reflection of reality.\u201d - The Fundamentals of Marxist-Leninist Philosophy, 1974, by F.V.

I\u2019m in the process of learning more of communism and socialism, so in an effort to aide in my understanding, I ask you to critique a hypothetical version of the DotP. For context, this takes place in a world-wide federal Commune, where the provinces are based on culture, geography, and are the remnants of the world!s nations.\n\nWorld Parliament- The highest council of the Commune, with representatives of each sector of labour elected by their sector, and the number of representatives determined by the populations of each sector (If there are 3 billion factory workers and 1 billion artists, the representatives for the factory workers will outnumber the representatives for artists). Representatives will vote on any movement which concerns their sector, and have a single vote each. \n\nPeople\u2019s Parliament of [Province]- The council for each province, which are the remnants of the world\u2019s nations. The representatives of this council are elected and the council operates in the same manner as the World Parliament, save for its subjectivity to the World Parliament.\n\nWorker\u2019s Council of [County]- The Council for each county, the next lowest administrative division of the World Commune, which operate exactly the same as the last councils and are subject to both of them. \n\nWorker\u2019s Council of [Parish]- The Council for the smallest administrative unit, the Parish, which consisted of a few important settlements, usually centred around the most important for the region. It functions the same as the above councils and is subject to all of them.\n\nThe representatives are all immediately recallable by a 3\/4ths majority sector vote, and upon their removal a new representative will be elected into office. A term lasts for 5 years, and then the representatives are up for re-election. A representative can be elected twice in a row before being required by law to wait for 10 years to run again, though that can be overturned by a 3\/4ths majority vote by the entire working population.\n\nThe various Parliaments have ministries within them which representatives are elected to by other representatives, though any election the Proletariat does not agree with can be redone with a 1\/2 majority population vote. The ministries cover the various elements of government, such as the Ministry of Economy which is responsible for creating the economic plan and seeing it followed.\n\nThe recalls and such things which require a public vote can be initiated by public petitions, with the amount needed to sign them being proportional to the population affected by the council in question. Voting is performed in the typical way, with ballots inputted into computers by the population then the results tallied automatically. The program which is used to tally is required by law to be open to the public, and any suspicion into the program can be investigated by an internal investigating body, and if there is an incongruence found in the program, a criminal investigation will be held and those responsible imprisoned. \n\nSo yeah, thanks for reading. This may be better suited for r\/Communism101, so I will post it there as well. If this post is inappropriate for this sub, then I will remove it.\n\nAddendum: The naming convention is only personal preference as I think the names sound cool, they could be changed for whatever name you wish and the system would remain the same,"subreddit":"communism","title":"Would This Be an Example of the DotP?"}

Until 1952, the prisoners were given a guaranteed amount food, plus extra food for over-fulfillment of quotas\n\n2. From 1952 onward, the Gulag system operated upon \"economic accountability\" such that the more the prisoners worked, the more they were\u00a0paid.\n\n3. For over-fulfilling the norms by 105%, one day of sentence was counted as two, thus reducing the time spent in the Gulag by one day.\n\n4. Furthermore, because of the socialist reconstruction post-war, the Soviet government had more funds and so they increased prisoners' food supplies.\n\n5.

{"author":"toiletpapershortage1","created_utc":1539214007,"num_comments":4,"score":33,"selftext":"If you are unable to access the article, this is what it says:\n\nThe state of the GDR economy has created a sea of \u200b\u200blegends that are contradictory and often have little in common with reality. Thus an economist wants to have found out that the GDR was at its end on the productivity level of the German Reich around 1914. Were tens of thousands of East European reapers harvesting crops as productive as combine harvests in national goods and LPGs in the 1980s? A new release now provides fact-rich enlightenment.\nProfessor Gerhard Heske, a proven expert with insider knowledge from the statistical offices of the Federal Republic as well as the GDR, has calculated and analyzed the economic development of both German states with the usual statistical methods. For the GDR economy, the balance is at first unflattering: in 1989, the gap between the GDR and the gross domestic product (GDP) per inhabitant was still 44 percent. Goods and services amounting to an average of 22,250 euros (price level 1995) were available to the German citizen, the GDR citizen only 12,516 euros.\n\nThis value can not be assessed separately from the development since 1950. The GDR had a higher annual average growth than the Federal Republic: 4.5 percent compared to 4.3 percent. Even in the 1980s, economic growth in the GDR (2.6 percent) was higher than in the Federal Republic (2.0 percent). Incidentally, today's economic experts are already cheering over 0.3 percent economic growth.\n\nDifferent population development\nIt should not be underestimated in the assessment of economic development that the population in West Germany increased by 12 million between 1950 and 1989, but decreased by 2.2 million in the GDR. As a result, GDP per capita grew even faster in the period: to 6.2 times in the GDR, in the Federal Republic of Germany to 4.3 times.\n\nHowever, this sizeable growth rate in the GDR was not enough to catch up with the blatant gap that existed at the beginning: at the start of 1950, GDP per capita in the Federal Republic was 5240, but only at 2028 euros in the GDR.\n\nOne can therefore only agree with Professor Heske when he writes: \"Even if one assumes that the GDR would have had an optimal economic system and that all economic policy decisions of the GDR leadership and government had complied with the principle of economic rationality, which was not the case was, the achievement of an economic equality would have been possible only under the condition of economic stagnation of the West German economy or a significant acceleration of growth in the GDR. \"The author further argues that in the GDR would be a growth of 6.2 Percent of GDP per worker was needed to make up for the initial backlog.The realization of such a long-lasting pace of development would have been a completely unrealistic scenario even for the GDR planning authorities under the then economic conditions.\n\nThe growth driver was the industry\nThe structure of GDP in both German states is also analyzed for the four decades of their parallel existence. The main driver of growth in the GDR was the manufacturing industry including the construction industry. In 1989, this area accounted for half of the gross value added of all sectors; in the Federal Republic this share was only 37 percent. Dominating was the area of \u200b\u200bfinancing, leasing, public and private services with a share of 45 percent. The use of GDP was also different. The higher incidence in the Federal Republic made it possible to invest more, which was not always continuous given the economic cycles. While in the 1950s 18 percent of West Germany's investment volume could be used per inhabitant in the GDR,\n\nHeske precisely exposes the methodology of his investigations. Step by step it is possible to track which sources have been developed and how the original data has been used to produce the presented analysis.\n\nThe question is justified, why the competent statistics authority of the Federal Republic was not ready to continue the promising started calculations for the GDR and the Federal Republic. National economic figures from 1925 to 1938 for the former federal territory are regularly published in the Static Yearbook. How can it not be possible to investigate and publish the much more recent and comprehensive statistics of the GDR? \n\nGerhard Heske: National Accounts GDR 1950-1989. Data, methods, comparisons. Cologne, 2009, 360 p., 12 \u20ac.\n\nOne thing that should be mentioned is that if growth of Net Material Product was calculated instead, this would be much more higher than in West Germany since the service sector and financial sector grew slower than the material sectors(except agriculture) in East Germany.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Catch up without catching up: The economy of the GDR achieved a considerable growth rate and productivity level"}

Since FB has been cracking down on fake pages, the weapon of choice is WhatsApp, which is virtually impossible to control. Steve Bannon is allegedly involved is his campaign as well.\n\nHe won the first round easily, reaching 46%, just 4% shy of winning outright. The second place, and his competitor in the second round, is Haddad, Lula's (the president from 2002-2010) political proteg\u00e9. Haddad's party - PT, Worker's Party - is strongly rejected by a large parcel of the population after 14 years of government (followed by 2 years of regressive politics post-impeachment), a strong recession and numerous corruption scandals. On the other hand, Bolsonaro suffers from even more rejection, about 45%, but still managed to attain 58% in the latest poll.\n\nMany, if not most voters of Bolsonaro choose him simply not to have PT in power again.Their hate of PT is such that they endorse a candidate with a VERY violent and hateful rhetoric, often making open threats to democracy itself (I highly recommend the lastest John Oliver on the Brazilian elections)\n\nAs a leftist party (in its inception, at least), PT has always faced some resistance from the elites, and the right has managed to compound and spread this hate with anti-corruption and pro-economy arguments. Though both are somewhat fair points against PT,  it's absolutely not reasonable to accept such an inept and hateful candidate as Bolsonaro because of them.\n\n---\n\nDialogue with most of his voters is nigh impossible. They thrive on memes, fake news and circlejerks and reject to read any sober analysis of the situation - EVERY decent intellectual and institution is against him,  even right-wing ones such as The Economist.\n\nI hope, however, that most of the poorer people who used to vote for PT (and who have profited enormously from its 3,5 tenures) and have now been swayed to the right are more open to dialogue and able to be convinced.\n\n**My question to you, especially those who have dealt with the rise of fascism in their country already, is what's the best way to talk to people about fascism and how to organize a modern campaign when WhatsApp is the main media vehicle**","subreddit":"communism","title":"How to campaign against the rise of fascism in Brazil?"}

The claim comes from this report: http:\/\/www.refworld.org\/pdfid\/482994662.pdf\n\nThe relevant passage is:\n\n&gt;A number of accusations of ill\u2010treatment and torture were brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur during the period covered by the present report. With regard to the nature of the torture, the Special Rapporteur was apprised of a whole series of torturing techniques applied. A former officer of the security police in his testimony listed [\u2026] eight types of torture[.] [\u2026] According to concordant testimony submitted to the Special Rapporteur: the Ministry of the Interior, the Kabul prisons and all the Kh\u00e2d detention centres were places where the special police and the members of the armed forces regularly practised torture. Incidentally several of the persons questioned, who had themselves undergone torture, confirmed these facts.\n\nTaken from points 86\u201387. Points 105\u2013106 also mention sexual abuse.\n\nEarlier it says this:\n\n&gt;In the course of interviews with the persons he met, he tried to establish the immediate reasons for their departure from their homes and their country to obtain temporary asylum in Pakistan. By and large the replies received by the Special Rapporteur attribute the reasons for their departure from home and country to a need for what was termed as \u2018respect for the faith and for liberty.\u2019\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m actually suspicious of the claims\u2019 legitimacy now. There is no mention of the refugees\u2019 class backgrounds (as to be expected), nor mention of physical examinations for signs of abuse, which makes me wonder if they were just nodding along and that was good enough for the Special Rapporteur. Since few names are given, it\u2019s difficult to revisit these claims, unless somebody published a follow\u2010up report. Also, the use of the passive voice is annoyingly common in this document and makes the perpetrators\u2019 factions ambiguous.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just being unreasonable and paranoid or if this truly is a case of poor research. It also seems that the Rapporteur only had contact with anti\u2010Soviet factions.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Did the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan commit torture?"}

From that day the USSR became mentioned only in the past tense. And the Soviet people, who had never wished that, proved unable to prevent the process, and they have to pay for their weakness up to the present.\n\nNeither of the newly formed sovereign states, that had earlier been a part of the USSR, could avoid the fate of a primitive colony of the prevailing imperial powers. Even the largest of them \u2014 bourgeois Russia \u2014 couldn\u2019t do better than become an energy-serving handmaid for the advanced European and Asian countries, moreover, she manages to be proud of it. To say nothing of the rest of the republics, possessing immeasurably less supplies of resources and workforce! Most of them are only still alive due to preserved economic relations with Russia.\n\nThe economies of all post-Soviet republics are now based on 1 or 2 branches, mostly of a material sector. All the most high-value, science-intensive and pioneering branches of industry are destroyed or dilapidated. The population living standards have fallen enormously. Social guarantees are at minimum everywhere. Instead, in these newly-appeared \u00abindependent\u00bb countries there is a giant increase of social differentiation, disorder, poverty, homelessness, child neglect, unemployment, drug abuse, prostitution and other \u201cdelights\u201d of capitalism, that have never been heard of in the Soviet Union.\n\nThe destruction of once united country has directly affected 75 million people out of the 300 million of the USSR population. Men and women, old people and children have entirely fallen on difficult times and have become refugees, victims of bomb attacks or physical violence on the part of bourgeois nationalists in their own country. Those people have all at once found themselves to be second-class human beings without elementary civil rights in the republics they have always called their home. Dozens, maybe even hundreds of thousands of former Soviet people have fallen in inter-ethnic and country-to-country military conflicts, originated from the processes of the USSR separation and property distribution. Those wars have been incessant for more than two decades now, new ones making things worse.\n\nThe vast majority of the former Soviet Union citizens regret the loss of the great united country, even those who have never lived in the USSR, born after its destruction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...read further [@www.work-way.com](https:\/\/work-way.com\/en\/2018\/09\/21\/on-the-causes-of-the-ussr-destruction-answers-of-ww-to-some-misguided-comrades\/)","subreddit":"Work_way","title":"\u00abBelavezha Accords\u00bb: How and Why the USSR Was Destroyed""num_comments":0,"score":19,"selftext":"","subreddit":"communism","title":"\u00abBelavezha Accords\u00bb: How and Why the USSR Was Destroyed"}

For me, being a Communist, this is a great way to gain some more support as history is in favour of Communism, especially in regards to the other political systems during the time we're studying. I'm quite good at history, and have given workshops to the entire class on subject such as World War One which we studied last term - usually presentations on google slides with memes that relate to the subject and then I verbally explain.  I've been asked to give a presentation on Communism, ([here's what I've been working on](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/presentation\/d\/1C-tKHLnk1rCAkECfVYEGneuvLX07klUrfc_o5YQmm4k\/edit?usp=sharing) \\- note that it won't be actually called \"the idiot's guide to communism, that's just a placeholder for my real name) as I'm the only one with any real understanding of the subject aside from my teacher (and she referred to the Bourgeoisie as \"middle class\", which, as we all know, is not correct). The problem is that although around 88% of my grade (163 boys, in an all boys school) is left-leaning, a number of the kids in history are vehemently anti-communist. I hope that the presentation will change their minds, but that's a long shot. \n\nthe subjects I'll be covering are:\n\n* Communist origins\n* Communist leaders\/leading figures\n* Communist variants (Trotskyism, Stalinism, Marxism-Leninism, Maoism, Juche etc)\n* Communism compared to other ideologies \n* The exploitative nature of Capitalism, why Communism is inevitable \n* Communist theory\/basic principles of Marxism \n* Communist history in the USSR 1917 - 1921, Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin and WWII\n* Debunking anti-communist myths: Communism killed (insert number) + Holodomor and Kulaks, Communism only works in theory, \"Communism doesn't let you have a toothbrush\", the Gulags\n* How Communist governments work\n\nall and any feedback\/criticism is appreciated. It's worth noting that I've only really considered myself to be truly Communist for about half a year or so, and only really found the strain I agree with recently, so any guidance would be also greatly appreciated.","subreddit":"communism","title":"I'm set to give a presentation\/crash course on Communism to my modern history class, how should I effectively radicalise my classmates?"}

Meanwhile it would cost approximately $10 billion to eliminate tuition fees in Canada.\n\nThere will be drinks, music, trivia, prizes, and we'll keep the speeches short! Tickets are $10 at the door. 20% of all profits will be donated to BC Disability Caucus. Doors open at 7:00 pm, Nov. 11, event starts at 7:30.\n\nSpeakers include pro-choice advocate and political activist Maya Cowan, Paul Gilbert from the BC Disability Caucus, YCL - Victoria Organiser, Tyson Strandlund, and more.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nAccessibility:\n\n- The Victoria Event Centre currently does not have an operational elevator, and there is one long flight of stairs at the venue entrance.

The question is really important, because the answer to it directly defines the answer to another question \u2013 what should the working class  and the working people do next, which way have they to  go, where to move and what to strive for.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that in the discussion of this topic, two opposing class forces should inevitably collide, one of which, that of the bourgeoisie, should invariably incline the working masses to an answer convenient and advantageous for it, in order to prolong the domination of that social class, while the other, that of the working class, is to pursue exactly the opposite goals, seeking to help the proletariat break away from capitalist captivity, finding the way to save them from the hired slavery. It turns out that the question of the causes of the death of the USSR and Soviet socialism is, as it were, the nodal point in which the irreconcilable class battle of ideas is now taking place, and the future of both the former Soviet republics and the whole of mankind directly depends on its outcome.\n\nHere it should be mentioned that in general the question of the causes of the death of the USSR is divided into 2 questions:\n\n1) the death of Soviet socialism and\n\n2) the destruction of the USSR, its division into several parts (as the supporters of the bourgeois point of view in this matter like to say, \u201cthe disintegration of the USSR\u201d).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...read further [@www.work-way.com](https:\/\/work-way.com\/en\/2018\/09\/21\/on-the-causes-of-the-ussr-destruction-answers-of-ww-to-some-misguided-comrades-2\/)","subreddit":"Work_way","title":"On the Causes of the USSR Destruction.

The George Soros meme is funny and all but it just feels like badmouse wastes too much trying to reach out to idiots in youtube comments. Over 20 minutes dedicated to a single person who is a big part of the conspiracies by various alt-right pundits. I know there is the wider point about the media being largely right-wing but it's been largely done to death. News has always been biased and this hasn't prevented revolutions in the past. I question if attaching ourselves to internet scenes (something badmouse himself decried) is actually a good strategy. Those kinds of videos aren't gonna be watched by the great mass of people we want to see them. Those kinds of topics appeal to a very specific (and very small) part of the world population which doesn't have a reputation for being that revolutionary. Is the prevalence of George Soros memes really going to get a trade union on board with us or a worker's co-op? Call me old-fashioned but I do feel like we need to focus on the real world still.

[\u2026] By the fall of 1952, there were no effective targets left for U.S. aeroplanes to hit. The anticommunists had already bombed every significant town, city and industrial area in North Korea. In the spring of 1953, the Air Force targeted irrigation dams on the Yalu River, both to destroy the North Korean rice crop and to pressure the Red Chinese, who would have to supply more food aid to the North. They hit five reservoirs, flooding thousands of acres of farmland, inundating whole towns and laying waste to the essential food source for millions of North Koreans. **Only emergency assistance from the P.R.C., the U.S.S.R., and their socialist allies prevented widespread famine**.\u2019\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that socialists would prevent a famine either.

{"author":"KentTheramine","created_utc":1540362109,"num_comments":15,"score":24,"selftext":"I   tried to make an argument to another subreddit concerning Social   Democracy &amp; How it was related to Fascism. After a while, I kinda   realized that Social Democracy isn't exactly Left at all. It's simply a   system meant to use Government funding to help raise Material Capital   for Capitalists in  times of Crises. Usually through the use of Social   Programs that will be  quickly abandoned when the Crises is gone &amp;   the Economy is Stable. A  Moderate example would be Obama right after   the 2008 Stock Market  Crash.\n\nHowever, it   usually comes at a  terrible price. The most extreme version of a   Social Democracy is  Hitler. The funds didn't just come from Taxes but   from stolen Jewish  gold. I can explain a little bit further but this is   just one reason why we don't consider the Nazis as Socialists.\n\nIn    Summary, Social Democracy is a Center-Right ideology centered around    the preservation of Capitalism. It is not at all Considered Left but    Demsoc.\n\nI stressed that **Social Democracy doesn't necessarily need a Democracy**   to do it's work. I argue that It's just a matter of giving Social   Programs to as much people as possible during a time of economic Crisis.   Thus any thing, right, Left or center can fit this category.\n\nAnd due to various factors, I can prove to you how a Social Democracy can be\\[but not necessarily is\\] Fascist. Firstly, **the Ultranationalist-Conservative argument**.    In this Argument, why are Fascists extremely Nationalist &amp;  usually   against immigration &amp; even Racist? This is actually a  simple   question to answer because it's economic. It relies on two  things. One,    **the amount of people that will be served these Social Programs would be as small as possible**.    In Sweden &amp; Norway, this usually entails Registration or    Citizenship to not allow those who are not there legally to partake in    it. This Practice only becomes Fascist once it reaches unalienable    properties to a person like Race, Class, Gender &amp; even Sexual    Orientation. **Two, with a sizeable minority, you can take everything they have to liquidate all the other's belongings**.    This makes it Economical to have Social Programs. History can prove  my   point here, During Hitler's time 522,000 Jews made up the  Population  of  Germany. This was a sizable minority. Added with the  factor that the   Jews were well represented among the wealthy,  including 24 percent of   the richest men in Prussia &amp; you got a  recipe for a good Target for   Fascism.\n\nSecondly, **The Capitalist-Crisis Management Argument**.    As I mentioned on my previous Argument, the main use of a Social    Democracy is to take the role of Capitalism for a temporary measure of    time. It spends for buildings, Infrastructure, Social Programs(like    Feeding Programs &amp; Scholarships) so that the Capitalists hoard    enough **profit** to stabilize the    economy of the country &amp; thus revert back into Neoliberalism.    However, in some instances, however rare, it becomes long enough to    transpire directly into Fascism. With less people to worry about &amp; a    more stable economy, a Fascism seems to be final Solution. One that    pays a heavy price.\n\nFinally, there is the **Autarkist-Reactionary Argument**. This is where the NaSDP or the Nazi Party got their inspiration from. In the Wake of the Revolution that brought about the **Bavarian Soviet Republic**,    many people who turned to Socialism were beginning to start uprisings    &amp; rebellions. This got the Nation's Attention to create a    reactionary force. The best one was just beginning to take root, the    NaSDP. They were against all of what Socialism stood for &amp; were    openly reacting against roots where Socialism could rise. And thus, they    were made from a Socialist Party pre-Hitler to a Fascist Party. They    had a simple goal. Where Socialism's end goal was Communism, the    Fascists had **Autarky.** This is a self-sufficient Republican Capitalist Society bent on Open Market Competition &amp; Imperialism.\n\nSocial   Democracy or Liberal Democracy to many has a very different meaning   when it comes to mine but though  it has almost Socialist Principles, it   is not within itself Socialist.  Here's a quote from the same page:\"**The protocols and norms used to accomplish this involve a commitment to** [**representative**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Representative_democracy) **and** [**participatory democracy**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Participatory_democracy)**; measures for** [**income redistribution**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Income_redistribution) **and** [**regulation of the economy**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Regulatory_economics) **in the** [**general interest**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Common_good)**; and** [**welfare state**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Welfare_state) **provisions. Social democracy thus aims to create the conditions for capitalism to lead to greater democratic,** [**egalitarian**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Egalitarianism) **and** [**solidaristic**](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Solidarity) **outcomes.\"**    This isn't Social Democracy anymore, this would be considered    Democratic Socialism, the two are usually misconstrued by Theory alone.\n\nA    \\[Fascist\\] Social Democracy isn't at all at the means of Regulating  the   Economy. The Nordic &amp; Obama era are good examples of how a   Moderate  Social Democracy \\[OP\\] would operate. The main difference   between the two  isn't just name but also how one pair of Words is   actually meant to be.  **Participatory Democracy,** There are two versions of this but for a truly Socialist System to work it must Champion \\[Trade\\] Union Activity or **Syndicalism.**    A Regular Social Democracy like the one above doesn't mention Trade    Unionism or the Advancement of Workers' Rights doesn't it? Now to go    back to the root of the argument. After explaining the Semantics of our    problem, Here is where my point lies. A Social Democracy without a    Socialist Foundation can devolve into Fascism Or just plain    Neoliberalism.\n\nAbout the Welfare  state   Argument, Social Democracy's main focus is Welfare provisions in  time   of Capitalist Crisis. For example, the Wiemar Republic was a Social  or   Liberal Democracy. It had all the provisions &amp; it did ramp back   the  economy. But due to the Hyperinflation, it devolved into Fascism.   The  same policies were still in place though, free Education, Welfare   for  all but then only for a small amount of the population.\n\nIt   was meant to be the way it was designed. The Argument of the Fascists   were both Social Democratic &amp; Reactionary. My Argument was intended   as a warning. Social Democracy is not as it is to everyone  else. It  is  merely a bleeding-out process. Soon, only time after it can  tell if   we've gone Fascist or Neoliberal. The Cycle will continue that  way.  To  be frank, This process happened here, in the Philippines, after all.  The  Marcos Era  was triggered by the Liberal Party of that time &amp;  only a  Revolution can make it skip a step. But such a thing will damage  the  Cycle &amp;  the economy of the present.\n\nI Wonder what your thoughts are in here. Just want to read your views","subreddit":"communism","title":"Social Democracy &amp; Fascism:"}

{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1540468987,"num_comments":76,"score":133,"selftext":"Hello Comrades I have been researching China in the past 3 days to see how \"Socialist\" it is, there are many people who say that it is or it is not Socialist anymore, those who accuse it of being very revisionist and those that say that it's just genuine Marxist adaptation to current material conditions. [There was a Quality Post here that aggregated most of the information](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/communism\/comments\/5ku8dz\/china_as_a_socialist_marxistleninist_state_a\/) and stood on the defensive side on China, saying that it is still Socialist, because of how the government controls the \"Commanding heights of the economy\".\n\nI am very skeptical about these claims.\n\nI don't know how true this was in the past, because there are literal private corporations there, and not just tiny ones but multi billion dollar ones, and even billionaire politicians in high ranking party positions. \n\nHowever with Xi's \"comprehensive deepening reforms\" doctrine that is about to change, so even if you thought that it was Socialist before, it is going full Capitalist in my opinion:\n\n&gt; In the economic realm, the Plenum announced that **\"market forces\"** would begin to play a **\"decisive\"** role in allocating resources.[89] This meant that the state would gradually reduce its involvement in the distribution of capital, and restructure state-owned enterprises to **allow further competition**, potentially by **attracting foreign and private sector players** in industries that were highly regulated previously.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Xi_Jinping#Announcing_reforms\n\n\nSo it seems like it's going full Gorbachev, they are basically privatizing the economy, though it says there that the State will play only a macroeconomic role and to provide welfare and security. Essentially turning China into a Social Democracy.\n\nThere is not even a slight doubt in my mind that they have lost their Communist goals and have embraced market economics entirely. Also the people on the Politburo are no better, like [Wang Yang](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wang_Yang_(politician)) who is basically a liberal who invented the [Cake theory](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cake_theory) which is basically neo-liberal Capitalism.\n\nAlso I have looked into the [2010 Chinese labour unrest](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2010_Chinese_labour_unrest) which was mindboggling to me. At firhst I thought it was talking about Taiwan but then I realized it's China. People were working in sweatshops under horrible conditions and beaten by security guards. Shit like this happens in Nazi Germany and not in a Socialist state, how the fuck can this thing be allowed in Socialism? And the most outragenous thing about it is that foreign NGO's were the ones investigating it and calling the Chinese government to do something, while the All-[China Federation of Trade Unions](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/All-China_Federation_of_Trade_Unions) just called for higher wages and better conditions and \"professionalizing\" local unionists (basically installing a [shop floor](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Works_council) system to quell the rebellious workers). Basically a slap on the wrist, no major fines, no nothing. So that is \"Socialism with Chinese characteristics\" for ya.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nYou could justify the partial privatizations saying that okay maybe they need to boost their economy, but Lenin had warned us against prolonged NEP. And the Stalinist economy worked just fine after things got collectivized and state run, so why the hell would one need a prolonged NEP for development? Seems very revisionist.\n\nBut then outright abandoning Socialism altogether and turning into a Social Democracy is another thing. When you have a widening gap of rich and poor in China, a new middle class petite-burgeoise growing, and billionaire CEO's and party managers.\n\nCan we really call them Socialists anymore? I doubt it. They have totally abandoned Socialism in my opinion.\n\nWhat do you think comrades?","subreddit":"communism","title":"Socialism in China under Xi"}

I've known him casually for a little while and until today he had no idea what my political affiliations were, but somehow while talking about movies he made some vague crack about \"all the millions of people Stalin killed.\" I politely rebuked him and after explaining the famine in a non-ideological way he asked if I was a socialist. When I said yes he was briefly angry, but two and a half hours later he was asking me for reading recommendations and as to how he could ever know which sources he could trust for news and history. I didn't expect the conversation to go as smoothly as it did, but as I am thinking about it afterwords it occurred to me that the most powerful weapon we have in our arsenal is respect. I'm not suggesting that we aren't already respectful to each other and non-comrades, but I think it is always worth reminding ourselves that we were all liberals (or even rightists) once and that it is a lot harder to hear what a Marxist has to say if that Marxist is also telling you why you are wrong. Simply being able to level with someone and showing them that your conversations are two-way-streets and not a speech can go a long way towards genuine communication and thus the proliferation of Marxist thought. That's what I want to remind everyone of, that as much as it means for us to be principled and indeed the vanguard of revolution these tasks are easier to do and met with more success when we practice what we preach and treat those who disagree with us as our comrades-to-be rather than simple adversaries.\n\n\n\nTL;DR Being respectful to non-comrades is the best way to interact with them.","subreddit":"communism","title":"A friendly reminder to all comrades..."}

That is why on our site there is a section [\u201cQuestions and Answers](https:\/\/work-way.com\/voprosy-i-otvety\/)\u201c, where the editors of the site try to clarify and refute all the most important bourgeois myths that exist in our society. This section will be constantly updated with new answers, as all kinds of questions from  workers keep coming  to the site\u2019s editorial board and we answer them publicly so that as many workers as possible could read these answers.\n\nOther materials on the WW website will also greatly benefit the comrades who are mastering Marxism on their own. Despite the fact that some of the materials are intended for a prepared reader, they will be interesting to beginners, even if they cannot fully understand everything written in them. The latter case is no problem: the education process is gradual. Scientific knowledge is not absorbed by a person right away; it takes time and a lot of self-refining work, long reflections and comprehension of what one has read, so that to wrap one\u2019s mind around what one has learnt from books and articles. With the accumulation of knowledge and a greater understanding of these fundamentals, which are not fully comprehensible on first reading, it makes sense to re-read it again (you may have to do this more than once) in order to fully understand what the author meant to say.\n\nThe materials of the WW site are no less useful, as they give a  clear classwise outlook on the true essence of the events taking place in Russia and in other countries of the world in a popular and comprehensible language.\n\n**The second stage: it is necessary to master the Marxist language, to understand the essence and meaning of the fundamental Marxist terms, getting the first idea of the main principles of the Marxist theory**.\n\nWW believes that the best tutorials to use for the purpose are textbooks of the 20-30s of the twentieth century. The Bolshevik Party at that time was facing a task of tremendous importance: as quickly as possible to give workers and peasants who did not have a decent education, the basics of scientific political knowledge, without which it was impossible to talk about building socialism in the country. And this task was successfully accomplished by the Bolsheviks \u2013 socialism was built in the USSR! The great achievements of the Soviet Union in the economy, politics, in the defense of their country, in the social sphere are excellent proof of the fact.\n\nToday, after a 25-year intensive brainwashing by bourgeois propaganda and three decades of Menshevism that dominated the CPSU since the mid-50s, the Russian communists have a similar task: to give Russian workers, representatives of the advanced intelligentsia and other layers of the working population of our country the basics of scientific knowledge, indispensable for successfully fighting the bourgeoisie and restoring socialism in our country.\n\nHere is a sample list of references for those comrades who are eager to master Marxism-Leninism and put it into practice in their work with the proletarian masses:\n\n**ML \u0421ourse (beginner level):**\n\n* N.

We believe that  it is works by V.I. Lenin that should be taken for the basis of training as he was a great revolutionary theorist and practitioner, and what is more, acting in Russia. Works by K. Marx and F. Engels, for all their importance and significance, are less important at this stage, they can be left for futher study, for the next stage \u2013 the advanced training stage carried out in parallel with practical work with the masses.\n\nWhat, among other things, makes Lenin\u2019s works so good? The fact that they are a kind of squeeze from  Marx\u2019s works, with the most important points of  his doctrine revised and adapted to the conditions of imperialism, in which we are now staying.  Lenin\u2019s works  are also very important from a purely practical point of view. Answers to the question of how is the working class to create a real communist party, how to wage agitation and  propaganda, how to understand and, therefore, treat certain situations \u2014 Lenin has all the cues. But perhaps the most important thing is that it is with examples of Lenin\u2019s decisions and explanations to them that one can learn the most essential thing in Marxism \u2014 the ability to apply the Marxist method (materialistic dialectics) in practice, without which the victory of the working class over the bourgeoisie is impossible.\n\nAlso very important are works by Joseph Stalin, without them it is impossible to understand the processes taking place in the USSR. And it is extremely necessary to do this, because today the death of Soviet socialism, incomprehensible to the working masses, is in many ways the brake that holds back the whole struggle for socialism in our country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ML Basic \u0421ourse:**\n\n* Plekhanov \u201cOn the Development of the Monistic Conception of History\u201d\n* Engels \"The Development of Socialism from Utopia to Science\"\n* K.

The texts of the works of the classics are now available on the Internet, they are posted on many sites, but we still strongly advise you to buy them in paper if possible. This can well be done with local second-hand booksellers, who happen to give Marxist literature for pennies, or through second-hand bookshops sites where you can place an order for books by cash on delivery.\n2. The books by the classics of Marxism are not fiction. One should read them thoughtfully, trying to understand every phrase, every idea of the author. It is necessary to constantly analyze what you have read, trying to understand whether the phenomena in question are present in today\u2019s reality.\n3. It is a good practice to carefully read the references, footnotes and notes in the works and textbooks, explanations can help to better understand the thoughts of the classics and the essence of the events described.\n4. Try to take notes of the literature studied. This will help to highlight the main and important thoughts, and to remember them. Mind that Lenin, while studying the works by Marx and Engels, did not disdain to do so, and those notes often helped him in practical revolutionary work.\n5. Make notes in the texts of the literature you are studying \u2013 they will then help you find the places to be re-read and reconsidered.\n6. When studying the works of the classics of the ML, do not miss the places where they criticize someone they knew at that time, even if you have never heard of the persons mentioned. Exactly the opposite, try to thoroughly grasp the essence of the controversial issue and understand WHY and WHAT FOR Lenin or Marx scold the views and outlooks of this or that comrade, think about their arguments, put forward your objections against the ones criticized, and then compare your criticism with the criticism of the founders of Marxism. In today\u2019s Russia, there are quite a few among our leftists whose position is close to that of those who were chastised by Lenin, Marx or Stalin 100 or 150 years ago. Opportunism is thriving now, so it is extremely important to learn to recognize it, to see its mistakes, distortions and juggling.\n7. Note that the above list of references gives the necessary minimum! It will give a general idea of what Marxism is all about and what the ideology of the working class really is.\n\nOne should not think that reading these works makes one a real Marxist-Leninist.

The Marxist parties have lost touch with working class.\n\nNow obviously one might wonder \"Why did not the leftists do anything before Fascism capture popular resentment\"? What I want to know is how do we build class conscious during times of \"relative peace\", when the moment agitators appear they are assassinated all over global south? \n\nPeople who agitate and organize are always a small percentage of population and are immensely easy to assassinate without causing any popular uproar. Since the media belongs to capitalists, communism is discredited and defiled, thus making the assassination of left wing agitators even less of a matter of concern in the minds of people who probably do not consider the matter of any relevance to them. The combination of these two factors - 1)  Extremely small section of population that become agitator, hence it being extremely easy to silence them, and 2) Popular discrediting and defiling of communism, thus generating a general apathy over deaths of such agitators - is what I personally think makes building class conscious in the times of \"relative peace\" extremely hard. \n\nSo how is class consciousness to be built under these conditions?","subreddit":"communism","title":"After reading posts on Brazil's ongoing situation, a query on how to build working class movement \"before\" popular resentment is usurped by Fascists."}

If you have empathy, you can never turn it off completely. You will feel like a stranger in your own country until this is over. Already you and people you care about have been demonized.

If you can't be brave, then be kind. If you can't put yourself out there, and I'm not saying you should, then do what you can quietly until you can't bare it anymore and you have to leave. But until you decide how you're going to respond, you will feel alienated. If you ever feel numb, then you're loosing your humanity. You're going to have find a confidant. Maybe it's your spouse, maybe it's someone else in your life like your best friend. very few people can bare the emotional burden you will feel when it all kicks off and never say anything. You will need to talk to people, and you need to know they won't betray you if it gets extremely extremely bad. You will also feel anger. That's also normal. But quash it if you can. Anger can make you do reckless things. You will get your revenge by living and not conceding to the madness around you. You need to be smart. Assume that lists of names are being assembled.

You can no longer speak out so openly. Make sure you know who you're talking to and who's listening.\n\n \n\nTake care. No matter how bad it gets, remember that there are people who care deeply about you. You're never as alone as you might think you are. I've been asked in DMs about VPNs. Here's a great article that explains a lot about the pros and cons of some reputable major ones out there. I personally recommend NordVPN \"  ~ Via \/u\/adlerchen\n\nTips from other users:\n\n-If you have a Portuguese grandparent, you are eligible for citizenship. via \/u\/AimingWineSnailz\n\n-In regards to VPNs I would recommend Mullvad over NordVPN. One indicator that might be a good idea is that NordVPN does this (taken from OP's article):\n\n&gt; We use Google Analytics and third-party ticket\/live chat tools (Zendesk\/Zopim). Google Analytics is used to improve our website and provide our users with the most relevant information. The ticket\/live chat tool is used to provide the best support in the industry (available 24\/7), but not tracking our users by any means.\nI mean, they don't even bother with shielding their users from fucking Google...\n\nMullvad meanwhile:\n\n&gt; We have no external elements at all on our website. We do use an external email provider; for those who want to email us, we encourage them to use PGP encryption which is the only effective way to keep email somewhat private. The decrypted content is only available to us.\nWay better. That's not to say that NordVPN isn't decent a choice though!\n\nIf you can't afford a VPN subscription and need a free VPN go with ProtonVPN.\n\nAlso mail! Please change to something like either tutanota or protonmail.\n \n~ Via \/u\/Sartanen\n\n-**Recommended** **email** **providers:**\n\n[Tutanota](https:\/\/tutanota.de\/)\n\n[Riseup](https:\/\/riseup.net\/)\n\n[Protonmail](https:\/\/protonmail.ch\/)\n\n**Regarding** **VPNs:**\n\nThe VPNs you will purchase most likely offers non-Brazil locations. Use them, not the ones located in Brazil. Can't afford a VPN? Use [Tor](https:\/\/torproject.org\/). Can afford a VPN? Use Tor still. Most of these services are available with a dedicated .onion address which are more secure than the clearnet one.\n\n**Secure** **payments**\n\nAvoid using credit cards\/bank accounts\/etc for purchasing a VPN or other things you prefer to keep discreet whenever possible. Get Bitcoin or other currencies instead. Simply buying bitcoin from someone is usually enough, however for extra security you can tumble the coins using [Privcoin](https:\/\/privcoin.io\/) or other coin mixers.\n\nCheck out [PrivacyTools.io](https:\/\/www.privacytools.io\/) for more tools and tips for security.\n\nhttps:\/\/0bin.net\/paste\/2oF2qNpVf8mNFqu8#B-iER4pDBL8qgc+iiUc9klwrcazlgK1bxPMMlASeOXx link to reddit post source code\n\n~ Via \/u\/Codefuser","subreddit":"communism","title":"Life and survival guide for Brazilian comrades.""num_comments":0,"score":5,"selftext":"","subreddit":"LeftWithoutEdge","title":"Life and survival guide for Brazilian comrades."}

Mantenha copias em um dep\u00f3sito banc\u00e1rio, se o banco for confi\u00e1vel. Mantenha c\u00f3pias digitais em um pendrive criptografado.

Eu espero que nenhum de voc\u00eas, e as pessoas que voc\u00eas conhecem e se importam, estejam em perigo.\u201d\n\nCOISAS PR\u00c1TICAS PARA FAZER NESTE MOMENTO\n\n1: consiga um VPN que tenha servidores que n\u00e3o possam ser intimados pelo governo. Delete suas contas sociais que possuem conteudo esquerdista e pr\u00f3 PT. Tenha certeza que, se pesquisado, nada possa ser rastreado at\u00e9 voc\u00ea. Qualquer conta nova em midias sociais que sejam atreladas a posi\u00e7\u00f5es pol\u00edticas devem ser feitas usando um email laranja(forjado).\n\n2: Se voc\u00ea tiver como, guarde uma quantidade de dinheiro em algum lugar escondido e bastante seguro, mas que voc\u00ea tenha acesso. Caso o pior aconte\u00e7a e voc\u00ea precisar sair do pais voc\u00ea vai precisar de dinheiro para suborno. Voc\u00ea ir\u00e1 precisar de documentos pessoais, e regimes autorit\u00e1rios nem sempre tornam a tarefa de tira-los acess\u00edvel a todos. Mantenha tamb\u00e9m alguns itens de ouro escondidos, eles valer\u00e3o em qualquer lugar que voc\u00ea possa acabar indo.\n\n3: retire seu passaporte agora, retire todos os documentos agora, mesmo que voc\u00ea n\u00e3o esteja planejando deixar o pais, pegue-os nessa porra de instante, voc\u00ea pode ser aceito em algum outro lugar e ter que pegar um avi\u00e3o correndo antes que a oportunidade desapare\u00e7a. Mantenha copias em um dep\u00f3sito banc\u00e1rio, se o banco for confi\u00e1vel. Mantenha c\u00f3pias digitais em um pendrive criptografado. As c\u00f3pias digitais podem ser usadas para se conseguir originais em embaixadas brasileiras ou em consulados, se o seu governo ainda estiver disposto a emiti-las.\n\n4:se voc\u00ea toma algum medicamento mantenha aten\u00e7\u00e3o redobrada de seus receitas. Tenha certeza de manter uma reserva de 2 meses que voc\u00ea possa levar com voc\u00ea. Voc\u00ea pode n\u00e3o conseguir exatamente o mesmo rem\u00e9dio em outro pais, devido as diferen\u00e7as em regula\u00e7\u00f5es legais para certos princ\u00edpios ativos, e pode levar tempo para conseguir um rem\u00e9dio substituto.\n\nSA\u00daDE MENTAL\n\nVoc\u00ea est\u00e1 assutado e nervoso. Talvez n\u00e3o exclusivamente por sua vida mesmo mas pela de outros. Isso \u00e9 bom, significa que voc\u00ea mant\u00e9m sua sanidade. Tamb\u00e9m significa que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 se sentindo bastante alienado por estar cercado de pessoas que n\u00e3o v\u00eaem nada de errado com a atual situa\u00e7\u00e3o. Isto vai piorar, esse sentimento vai crescer e r\u00e1pido. Se voc\u00ea possui empatia voc\u00ea jamais conseguir\u00e1 deixar de se importar por completo. Voc\u00ea se sentir\u00e1 como um estranho no seu pr\u00f3prio pa\u00eds at\u00e9 tudo isso acabar. Voc\u00ea e pessoas que voc\u00ea se importa com foram demonizadas. Grupos de \u201clobos\u201d, e o estado, podem acabar agindo sobre esse demoniza\u00e7\u00e3o. Neste exato momento voc\u00ea talvez nem tenha certeza o que voc\u00ea pode fazer e se \u00e9 que deve fazer algo. Isso \u00e9 normal. Por\u00e9m voc\u00ea tem at\u00e9 janeiro para decidir o que fazer, se voc\u00ea vai se tornar uma pessoa mais privada e buscar sua seguran\u00e7a pessoal, ou se decide ficar e se tornar uma pessoa p\u00fablica para ajudar os outros e a si mesmo. Se n\u00e3o pode ser corajoso ent\u00e3o seja gentil. Se n\u00e3o pode se jogar l\u00e1 fora, e eu n\u00e3o estou dizendo que voc\u00ea deveria, ent\u00e3o fa\u00e7a oque pode quietamente at\u00e9 que n\u00e3o possa mais suportar e acabe partindo. Por\u00e9m at\u00e9 voc\u00ea decidir que atitudes tomar voc\u00ea se sentir\u00e1 alienado.

Voc\u00ea precisar\u00e1 achar algu\u00e9m em que possa confiar e se abrir. Talvez sua esposa, talvez algu\u00e9m na sua vida como um melhor amigo. Pouqu\u00edssimas pessoas conseguem segurar um grande fardo por muito tempo e nunca dizer nada a ningu\u00e9m. Voc\u00ea precisar\u00e1 conversar com as pessoas, e voc\u00ea precisar ter certeza que elas n\u00e3o ir\u00e3o lhe trair caso as coisas fique realmente ruins. Voc\u00ea tamb\u00e9m sentir\u00e1 raiva, oque \u00e9 normal, mas n\u00e3o deixe ela lhe dominar. A raiva pode lhe fazer agir de forma extremamente imprudente. Voc\u00ea ter\u00e1 sua vingan\u00e7a vivendo a vida e n\u00e3o sucumbindo a loucura que te cerca. Voc\u00ea precisa ser esperto.
