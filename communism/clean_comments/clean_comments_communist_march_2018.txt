My brother first worked in Vladivostok as a cook, but the pay was too low and he moved to South Korea. Now he is a postman there.\n\nThat is typical for people who live in the Far East. Since we\u2019re so close to Asian countries like South Korea and China, people often move there because the pay here is too low to meet normal living standards. When I was a child we\u2019d often take the bus to China for weekend trips and stock up on cheap goods. The border town of Suifenhe is just a three-hour bus ride from Vladivostok.\n\nI do love my country, but the current economic slump we\u2019re in is awful. Our lives are getting worse, and will continue along that path. Factories are closing across the country, roads are falling apart, and yet we\u2019re about to host the World Cup.\n\nSalaries at state-funded schools and hospitals are incredibly low. Who would want to be a teacher for 10,000 rubles ($172) a month?\n\nNevertheless, I feel obliged to stay here: this is the home of my ancestors. Nobody needs you abroad; they need you in your home country and you have to take the initiative if you want your surroundings to improve.\n\nAfter I finish my chemistry degree, I\u2019d like to work in a laboratory. I\u2019m considering moving to Novosibirsk because I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s a good city for the sciences.\n\n\nI'm a member of a communist party called the Revolutionary Workers\u2019 Party, which adheres to Bolshevism and Leninism. We go to factories and listen to the workers, and we try to bring attention to specific issues through media coverage or sanctioned pickets.\n\nWe also hold lectures on political theory to inform people, and we discuss the drawbacks of the Soviet Union and how those pitfalls could be avoided if the system were to be re-implemented. The average age of our Vladivostok faction is about 18. None of us ever experienced the Soviet Union.\n\nDuring the Soviet Union, the quality of education was phenomenal. But people also had the opportunity to achieve financial comfort without receiving higher education. You had stability, which is the most important thing in a person\u2019s life.\n\nThey say that Soviet citizens had no clothes or food, etc., which isn\u2019t true. Everyone had just what they needed.\n\nNow we see all these exotic fruits at the supermarket, but what\u2019s the point of having them if we can\u2019t afford them? On the surface it looks like, \u201cOh, we live such a wonderful life!\u201d But then you go home and eat your buckwheat for dinner. All the U.S.S.R.\u2019s achievements \u2014 free education, free health care and free housing \u2014 are just becoming inaccessible dreams for ordinary Russians.\n\nPeople often criticize the Soviet government for repression, but all the amazing achievements of the Soviets justified the means. It often feels like the stories about Stalinist repression are exaggerated. I\u2019ve asked my relatives and friends, and not a single person knows anyone who was a victim of the Soviet regime.\n\nHistory is written by the winners, but the Soviet Union collapsed. Dissidents like writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn overdramatized the events in their accounts.\n\nStalin was a great leader \u2014 particularly if you consider our victory in World War II and who our enemy was. He shielded us from the ultimate evil \u2014 what else is there to say?","created_utc":1519951715,"score":58,"subreddit":"communism"}

Uncritically accepting and accommodating such individuals because they agree with the need for violence will undoubtedly discourage many people from getting involved in politics. Despite RGA\u2019s nominal adherence to proletarian feminism, their politics and statements display an extreme degree of male-chauvinism...The MLM understanding of criticism from within and without the organization enables collectives to properly overcome contradictions and take seriously the ideas of the masses. What initially appear as a secondary contradiction may in fact be, or may become, primary, and for this reason it is important to proactively work to handle secondary contradictions from the outset. It is essential to investigate and preserve minority opinions in a collective as well, a practice the CCP encouraged at all levels.37 Calling-out abuse and abusers, as well as articulating even partially-formed criticisms against potentially wrong ideas and approaches is essential to this process, especially among the masses and emerging activists. RGA instead discourages any and all criticism until one has a \u201cgood understanding of the dialectical relationship between theory and practice.\u201d38 This is the bourgeois view of politics in which only the ideas of anointed \u201cexperts\u201d matter, and no one else has the right to speak or question these so-called experts. In RGA\u2019s view their supposedly superior practice justifies a commandist approach to politics and gives them immunity from criticism. Their view is non-dialectical. Those who have spent time in \u201ccollectives\u201d where patriarchy and individualism reigns supreme will be familiar with RGA\u2019s effectively hollow and pernicious claim that their \u201cpolitics of the deed\u201d supposedly justifies all.

He sits in silence, the only sound the hiss of a coffee machine at the back of the caf\u00e9. The pause drags on while the man who could soon be in charge of the British economy tries to answer the question: \u201cWho are your business heroes?\u201d\n\nMcDonnell lists his hobby in Who\u2019s Who as \u201cfermenting (sic) the downfall of capitalism\u201d. As a previously self-proclaimed Marxist \u2014 and past admirer of Venezuela\u2019s socialist state \u2014 he is perhaps the most leftwing person ever to hold the role of shadow chancellor.\n\nHe was recorded at one meeting in 2011 encouraging unhappy workers to spit in their bosses\u2019 tea. Ken Livingstone, the leftwing former mayor of London, sacked him in the 1980s for being too radical. For certain business leaders, the idea of McDonnell in the Treasury is starting to eclipse Brexit as a pressing political concern.\n\nBack in the caf\u00e9, a reply comes at last. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question, really,\u201d he says, slowly. There is another pause. His press adviser offers some ideas: \u201cYou like Dale Vince?\u201d he says, referring to the renewable energy entrepreneur. There is another pause.\n\nEventually the words tumble out: \u201cThere\u2019ll be creative business leaders but actually, when it comes down to it, they can\u2019t do anything unless they\u2019re part of a collective,\u201d says McDonnell. \u201cUnless they\u2019ve got that wealth creator, that engineer and that work person, that skilled person at the bench to fulfil that idea\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009they\u2019re nothing.\u201d\n\nOf late, McDonnell has seemed to cut a more pragmatic figure, sipping tea with asset managers and sharing football banter with Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England. The day before our interview he was meeting business leaders in Birmingham. The previous week he was at the London Chamber of Commerce: \u201cIt was packed out\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I\u2019ve been saying to them, \u2018Look, there\u2019s no tricks up our sleeves. I want these ideas tested almost to destruction.\u2019\u200a\u201d He even attended this year\u2019s Davos, albeit to offer a warning about the \u201cpolitical and social avalanche\u201d set to hit the world elite.\n\nSo who is the real McDonnell? Diane Abbott, an old ally and Labour MP, observed last year: \u201cJohn McDonnell has done his best to transform himself into a friendly, bank-manager-type figure, which, if you know John McDonnell as well as I do, is\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009interesting.\u201d\n\nToday, the MP is hosting the FT in his constituency. Hayes &amp; Harlington, a gritty west London seat divided by the M4, is home to a high immigrant population and Heathrow airport. McDonnell takes a close interest in deportation claims, welfare battles and \u2014 increasingly \u2014 housing issues. \u201cWe\u2019ve got people living in the most appalling conditions, overcrowding, people sleeping in the streets and on the canal, in the parks; we also have the phenomenon of beds in sheds.\u201d\n\nUntil May 2015, John McDonnell, 66, was a historical footnote. The silver-haired leftwinger tried to stand as Labour leader in 2007, promising to break the stranglehold of the \u201cNew Labour\u201d elite, but failed to get on the ballot. In 2010 he tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 again. By the general election of 2015, he had suffered a heart attack and seemed set for oblivion. \u201cI was going to happily drift into retirement and sit at the back of halls complaining,\u201d he says. \u201cThen Jeremy decided to have a run.\u201d\n\nToday, a McDonnell chancellorship is a realistic possibility. Labour is neck and neck with the Tories in the polls and secured 40 per cent of the vote last summer \u2014 just two points behind Theresa May\u2019s party. McDonnell believes he is on the brink of making history, should the government collapse because of Brexit.\n\n\u201cOur objectives are socialist. That means an irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen we go into government, everyone will be in government.\u201d In keeping with these turbulent political times, he is currently reading\u00a0Imperium, the Robert Harris book about Cicero and the Roman Republic. Asked whom he empathises with in it, he replies: \u201cThe poor guy Cicero employs to write all this up.\u201d\n\nMcDonnell was born in Liverpool on September 8 1951. His father was a union-activist docker turned bus driver and his mother worked as a cleaner and then at BHS behind the biscuit counter. (\u201cWe had broken biscuits on a regular basis.\u201d) They lived in a house with an outdoor loo and a tin bath: \u201cI know it sounds a bit Monty Python\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009Sociological studies now say it was one of the worst slums in Europe but we used to just call it home.\u201d\n\nThe family subsequently moved to Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, and McDonnell, a former altar boy, was sent to Ipswich to train as a priest. \u201cI discovered two things: girlfriends, so celibacy would have been a problem. The second was politics\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I developed a different belief system.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving school at 17, he held a series of unskilled jobs, including working 12-hour shifts making Philips TVs. He took A-levels at night school and studied politics at Brunel University and then Birkbeck. He and his first wife became \u201chouse parents\u201d for a children\u2019s home in Hayes. \u201cSome of them had been through terrible experiences,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe ran it like our own family, wherever we went they went with us. We\u2019d go to see my Mum with eight to 10 kids in my Morris Traveller.\u201d He remarried in 1995, and has three children and five grandchildren.\n\nMcDonnell was also working as a union official before being elected to the Greater London Council, becoming chair of finance at just 29. At the annual GLC pantomime, he played the cat to Livingstone\u2019s Dick Whittington. Another year, he played a policeman alongside Paul Boateng dressed as a judge in a basque. \u201cI\u2019m just glad there isn\u2019t a film of it.\u201d\n\nFour years later he was ousted over the \u201crate-capping\u201d of council tax. At the heart of the row was a claim that McDonnell had pretended the Tory government\u2019s rate cap would require \u00a3140m of cuts. Livingstone told him: \u201cWe\u2019re going to look like the biggest f***ing liars since Goebbels.\u201d McDonnell labelled Livingstone \u201ca Kinnock\u201d \u2014 shorthand for a sell-out. The two men didn\u2019t speak for a decade, according to Livingstone. Cast out of City Hall, McDonnell co-edited a controversial leftwing newspaper.\n\nAfter becoming an MP in 1997, McDonnell busied himself in various ways: chairing meetings of the anti-Heathrow expansion group, setting up an umbrella group of leftwing unions and leading a campaign against the construction industry, which had been blacklisting workers for their political views and union activities, leading to a \u00a375m settlement. No one doubts his work ethic. Dave Smith, head of the Blacklist Support Group, says he would often encounter McDonnell at a picket at 6.30am: \u201cWhen no one else was prepared to talk to us he was there\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009representing working people fighting for justice.\u201d\n\nBut it was the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader in 2015 that transformed the fortunes of his closest ally. The pair first met in London in the 1970s. \u201cWe hit it off straight away,\u201d recalls McDonnell. They would head to a demo then go to Gabi\u2019s, a caf\u00e9 off Trafalgar Square: \u201cI\u2019d have a salt-beef sandwich and he\u2019d have a vegetarian dish.\u201d\n\nMcDonnell and Corbyn are uncannily like-minded: both opposed the Iraq war, were early critics of PFI schemes, were sceptical about the EU and fought for various unpopular causes at fringe events. \u201cWe\u2019ve never fallen out, we\u2019ve never had an argument\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009we\u2019ll disagree on tactics but we usually arrive at a consensus,\u201d says McDonnell. They voted together against the Labour party leadership hundreds of times.\n\nWhen Corbyn became leader, he ignored pleas from some trade union allies to put a less divisive figure in the pivotal role of shadow chancellor. Paul Kenny, former head of the GMB, who fell out with McDonnell over an industrial dispute, is forthright: \u201cMy experience with him in recent years is that he\u2019s untrustworthy.\u201d\n\nUnder Corbyn, Labour has shifted decisively to the left, flush with 400,000 new members inspired by his uncompromising commitment to equality, as well as specific pledges such as scrapping tuition fees and more money for the NHS. Yet while Corbyn is the symbol of the movement, McDonnell plays an arguably more important role in Labour\u2019s new management. While the leader gives speeches to adoring crowds, McDonnell is more of an organiser.\n\nAn avid reader, he is inspired by Gramsci, the Italian Marxist who believed socialism would triumph by infiltrating \u201cschools, universities, churches and the media\u201d. \u201c[McDonnell] is the brains behind Labour\u2019s hard-left strategy. I think nobody should underestimate him, he works hard, he is effective, methodical, but he is utterly ruthless,\u201d says Margaret Hodge, a Labour MP who first met him in the 1980s. She compares him to a \u201cJekyll and Hyde character\u201d, saying: \u201cYou never know for sure if you\u2019re seeing a sensible bank manager character or a revolutionary Trot.\u201d\n\nAlan Simpson, a former Labour MP \u2014 and friend of both Corbyn and McDonnell \u2014 says they are the \u201cTorvill and Dean\u201d of British politics. \u201cJeremy skates round the country with almost karmic serenity, winning admirers for his openness and integrity,\u201d he says. \u201cJohn, meanwhile, plans the detail of their programmes and does most of the heavy lifting.\u201d\n\nA less tactful colleague describes Corbyn as a \u201cdosser\u201d: \u201cJohn is a Stakhanovite, Corbyn is lazy, he\u2019s the bloke who just turns up, while John is the one who reads the papers beforehand.\u201d\n\n","created_utc":1519999983,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"TheSutphin","body":"Corbyn\u2019s son, Seb, is an adviser to McDonnell, although the MP recoils at any suggestion of nepotism: \u201cWhether or not his name was Corbyn I didn\u2019t care\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009he\u2019s just extremely talented.\u201d McDonnell also bristles at the idea that he is the real strategic organiser. \u201cI\u2019ve heard this rubbish. That\u2019s absolute rubbish because when we do things, we do things together,\u201d he says, tightening his fist and jabbing it forward. \u201cPeople underestimate Jeremy\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009don\u2019t underestimate his ability for strategic decision-making.\u201d\n\nWhile McDonnell has a sense of humour, his dour public demeanour \u2014 he speaks in in flat tones, with a trace of Scouse \u2014 is in contrast to Corbyn\u2019s grandfatherly charm. He does not entirely reject the idea he is the Lennon to Corbyn\u2019s McCartney. \u201cHe [Corbyn] is one of the most caring people I\u2019ve ever met\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009he doesn\u2019t like conflict but he\u2019s absolutely principled,\u201d he says. \u201cMe, I\u2019m slightly different, more than slightly different\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009I will be more in people\u2019s faces and we\u2019ve complemented one another on that basis.\u201d\n\nThe so-called hard man of the left appears a more mellow figure these days, clutching an FT as he meets eminent figures from the CBI, Whitehall or the BBC. When the FT first requested an interview, he texted back to warn that he would \u201cnot be very interesting\u201d.\n\nYet there is a volatile streak: whether hurling Mao\u2019s\u00a0Little Red Book\u00a0across the despatch box in 2015 or waving the mace around the Commons in protest at Heathrow\u2019s expansion. In 2014, McDonnell approvingly quoted the idea of Tory MP Esther McVey being lynched, and he once joked about \u201cgarrotting\u201d Danny Alexander, a former Lib Dem cabinet minister. \u201cHe survived, didn\u2019t he?\u201d McDonnell retorts, when asked.\n\nChallenged on his violent rhetoric, the MP claims he is merely a \u201cstreet orator\u201d. \u201cI call a spade a shovel, straightforward. If I disagree with someone, I tell them.\u201d He has faced abuse for his views too, he says, for example when he advocated gay-friendly policies at the GLC in the 1980s: \u201cI had my window smashed, milk bottles broken in my children\u2019s sandpit and maggots poured through my letter box.\u201d\n\nMore serious are the claims around what Nigel Dodds, a DUP MP, has called \u201ca sinister\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009attachment to violent Irish republicanism\u201d. McDonnell was forced to apologise for saying in 2003 that the IRA should be honoured. He had declared: \u201cIt was the bombs and bullets and sacrifice made by the likes of Bobby Sands that brought Britain to the negotiating table.\u201d In 2015 he told the BBC: \u201cIf I gave offence \u2014 and I clearly have \u2014 from the bottom of my heart I apologise. I apologise.\u201d\n\nYet in his study in Hayes, among old copies of Hansard and files labelled \u201chuman rights\u201d and \u201cgroceries adjudicator bill\u201d, there is still a plaque dedicated to \u201cH-Block Martyrs 1981\u201d, a reference to the 10 IRA and IRNLA prisoners who died during the hunger strikes, including Sands. McDonnell denies that he resisted the peace process: \u201cI\u2019ve always honestly and openly said I believe in a united Ireland, but the point was to try and get to a united Ireland without the violence.\u201d\n\nLivingstone, who is currently suspended from the Labour party, recalls: \u201cPeople like me and Jeremy and John wanted to stand up for the Irish who had been persecuted and mistreated. But you never heard them say, \u201cOh good, there has been a bomb.\u201d\n\nIn a 2006 interview, McDonnell said his inspirations were \u201cthe fundamental Marxist writers of Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, basically\u201d. When he ran a book club at the Trades Union Congress, members would joke that they had to read the same book every week:\u00a0Das Kapital.\n\nRob Marris, a former MP who served in McDonnell\u2019s first Treasury team, says he is only interested in ideas that accord with his world view: \u201cHe is inclusive, as long as you don\u2019t cross him.\u201d\n\nSome colleagues believe McDonnell still craves the leadership. That could be eased by a likely change in the rules allowing candidates to stand with fewer MP signatures. But with his health record, the clock is ticking. Indeed, he denies any such ambition: \u201cThere\u2019s no hope. Literally no \u2014 and I\u2019ve made that clear time and time again.\u201d\n\nUntil last summer the Corbyn-McDonnell axis was seen as a sideshow, given the huge Conservative poll lead. But since Labour gained 30 seats in the June election, and Theresa May\u2019s cabinet has become increasingly divided over Brexit, business leaders have been queueing up both to meet the shadow chancellor and express their scepticism about him.\n\nThere has been an unlikely mutual courtship dubbed \u201cthe tea offensive\u201d by the McDonnell team, with him and Corbyn regularly meeting business groups such as the CBI and FSB. \u201cThey need to know where we\u2019re coming from\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009it will be amicable and friendly\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but we don\u2019t accept any money from bourgeois organisations.\u201d He does, however, make an exception for the owner of the caf\u00e9 we are sitting in, who brings over some free baklava.\n\nMcDonnell insists that companies are \u201clooking to [Labour] for security\u201d in an uncertain world. His policies span the radical to the mainstream, including the nationalisation of some utilities, higher taxes to fund a more generous welfare state, billions of borrowing for infrastructure and the relocation of most of the Bank of England to Birmingham. He is interested in alternative models of ownership and in copying the Scandinavian model of enhanced profit-sharing for employees. \u201cAre those ideas inspired by Marx? They\u2019re inspired by socialists and, of course, Marx is one of those thinkers, alongside RH Tawney, GDH Cole, William Morris,\u201d he says.\n\nMcDonnell has had an open-minded reception from some business leaders who still resent the Tories over Brexit. They want Labour to pressurise the government into a softer Brexit, despite Corbyn and McDonnell\u2019s history of Euroscepticism: it was said in the past that \u201ceven one single market is too many markets\u201d for them.\n\nMcDonnell was accused of mixed messages in the referendum campaign, in which he used the phrase \u201cProject Fear\u201d to describe the Remain campaign. Reminded of this, his body language becomes tense, his shoulders hunched: \u201cThis argument that Jeremy and I didn\u2019t campaign enough: that\u2019s rubbish. We worked bloody hard,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was like a by-election where everyone\u2019s grievances piled into that one vote.\u201d\n\nMcDonnell voted Remain and claims to have been gutted by the result. Either way, he has been cautious about Labour shifting away from its current ambiguity over Brexit: \u201cYou can alienate people, it\u2019s like walking a tightrope.\u201d\n\nMcDonnell believes there is other potential common ground with business, such as extra money for skills and infrastructure. \u201cWhere we disagree is on how to get there,\u201d says one business leader who has met the shadow chancellor.\n\nThe manifesto promised \u00a348bn of additional annual spending, funded by higher taxes on business and the rich. There would be an extra \u00a3250bn of borrowing over 10 years \u2014 but only for infrastructure.\n\nIn the autumn, the CBI warned that one Labour policy \u2014 nationalising railways, water companies and the energy grid \u2014 would \u201csend investors running for the hills\u201d. Parliament would decide the level of compensation for the nationalisations, funded by the issuance of new gilts. Terry Scuoler, until recently head of the Engineering Employers\u2019 Federation, has warned that McDonnell in the Treasury would be a \u201cnightmarish\u201d prospect for business. \u201cThere are a number of policy initiatives which are likely to be the thin end of a hardline socialist wedge.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of much higher taxes and borrowing is anathema to many in the business community, and a double threat to those already concerned about Brexit. One executive in the City says colleagues are divided on how to deal with Labour: \u201cThere\u2019s a school of thought that we need to engage and try to influence them, but then others say you can\u2019t put lipstick on a pig,\u201d he says.\n\nLabour suggests its election manifesto from June was mainstream: \u201cCorporation tax would be lower than under Tony Blair. Income tax would be lower than under Thatcher,\u201d says one front-bencher, who contrasts it with the \u201ccrackers\u201d manifesto of 1983, which proposed a ban on imports of foreign cars. Meanwhile, business leaders hope that revolutionary ideas could be curbed by more moderate forces within Labour \u2014 or by coalition with the SNP or Lib Dems.\n\nThe main concern in the business community is whether the manifesto is the limit of McDonnell\u2019s ambitions or just an appetiser for a more radical programme once elected.\n\nA centrist Labour MP predicts the shadow chancellor will \u201cgo for broke\u201d if he ever gets into power. \u201cThere are a lot of people who will never, ever trust him\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009he\u2019s very, very authoritarian.\u201d\n\nOne person who has worked with McDonnell says people are right to be sceptical: \u201cI think he views business people and centrists as \u2018useful idiots\u2019, to quote Lenin,\u201d he says. But McDonnell insists that remaining Blairites have nothing to fear: \u201cHaving a broad church is useful, it stops a situation where the emperor has no clothes.\u201d\n\nRichard Barbrook, a self-styled \u201ccybernetic communist\u201d who advises the shadow chancellor on the digital economy, says McDonnell would like to be more radical than the 2017 manifesto, \u201cbut he wants to take other people with him\u201d. McDonnell tries to sound reassuring: \u201cWe\u2019ve set out what we\u2019re going to do and that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nAdopting a bipartisan approach once in office has happened before. As mayor of London from 2000 to 2008, Livingstone surprised critics with his own cross-party stance. \u201cWhen John becomes chancellor he will have the same problems that I had: you can\u2019t get everything you want through,\u201d he says. \u201cThey won\u2019t stand on one manifesto and then go off in a more radical direction.\u201d\n\n","created_utc":1519999994,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"TheSutphin","body":"And there have been signs of pragmatism from McDonnell. One such was his campaign against the Heathrow third runway, during which he worked with Tory MPs including Zac Goldsmith and Justine Greening. \u201cAlthough our politics couldn\u2019t be further apart, I\u2019d certainly consider him a friend,\u201d says Goldsmith.\n\nIronically, some leftwingers question whether McDonnell would be a radical chancellor, asking why, for all his talk about research on inequality by economist Thomas Piketty, there was no wealth tax in the manifesto. \u201cSome of us don\u2019t know any more if he wants a socialist country or just wants to tweak the capitalist system,\u201d says a colleague.\n\nAs he tries to recalibrate his public image, McDonnell has been urged to \u201cpace yourself\u201d by doctors. But even as he went to hospital after his heart attack in 2013, he couldn\u2019t drop the politics. \u201cWe were talking about consultants\u2019 pay and how anaesthetists aren\u2019t properly represented in Parliament,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI said, \u2018Lads, you should concentrate on this.\u2019\u201d\n\nColleagues say his timetable is increasingly stretched given his constituency duties, his role as shadow chancellor and his party role: he could be 70 by the next election. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of strain on him for a bloke who\u2019s had heart problems,\u201d says one MP. \u201cYou never, ever see him relaxed.\u201d\n\nThe little time off he has is spent with his favourite authors \u2014 who include Charles Dickens, particularly\u00a0Bleak House \u2014 and watching football.

They are undoubtedly not socialist in any manner.\n\n&gt; In the wake of the Trump election victory, even more layers of new radicals are being drawn into the orbit of the Left. However, revolutionary Marxism remains marginal in terms of its popularity among the proletariat\n\nI think that the latter sentence is much more true than the former. Marxism still remains marginal.\n\n&gt; In a post-USSR world dominated by U.S. imperialism, we find ourselves at an impasse. We can continue to operate on the basis of outdated Cold War politics, or we can look forward and develop a new Marxism for our conjuncture.\n\nAn improved Marxism is what is needed going forward with question.\n\n&gt; The purpose of this blog is to facilitate dialogue between non-sectarian, anti-dogmatist Marxists to develop theory, strategy, and analysis.

While we are not opposed to publishing pieces of a theoretical nature, we are looking specifically for pieces that are grounded in concrete struggle and questions of strategy and tactics.\n\nOnce again this is a valid goal. I'd have to think more in terms of tactics.\n\n&gt; We hope that this blog can serve as a tool for further dialogue with the intention of building inroads between Marxists, socialists, and communists of various tendencies and traditions.\n\nI would say here though that Trotskyists have a distorted view which colors all their analysis. \n\n&gt; The goal of this particular essay is to provoke discussion on strategy and practice for the revolutionary left in the U.S. today, as well as to engage with the Marxist-Leninist trend regarding what we believe to be its strengths and weaknesses. \n\nI look forward to read it. \n\n&gt; We welcome criticism, commentary, and general engagement with this essay in the spirit of comradely discussion.\n\nI'm glad to hear that.","created_utc":1520045514,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"intlnews","body":"Continued. \n\n&gt; In the United States today, there exists a political trend which describes itself as Marxist-Leninist. This trend is organized as a loose constellation, orbiting around organizations such as the Workers World Party (WWP) and the Party for Socialism and Liberation (PSL), and to a lesser extent the Freedom Road Socialist Organization-Fight Back (FRSO).\n\nI've read MIM Prisons and they say that the WWP is \"neo-Trotskyist\" due the fact that the founder of the WWP was originally informed by Trotskyism but I would not say that is the case now. I would say they are Marxist-Leninist, with the same applying to PSL and FRSO which I'm familiar with.\n\n&gt; Members of this trend associate in forums such as r/communism on Reddit, on Facebook in pages and groups such as Bro, We Are Communist. Problem? and Karl Marx\u2019s Red Reading Room, and on Twitter. \n\nI haven't heard of those Facebook groups or others on twitter, but there are some other forums apart from /r/communism like /r/communism101 or even /r/debatecommunism.\n\n&gt; Though containing members of all generations, this contemporary Marxist-Leninist trend has a particular character among millennials, including those in their early thirties or late twenties radicalized during the protests against the Iraq War or in the Occupy Movement, and younger members radicalized during Black Lives Matter or the election of Trump. The authors count ourselves among many others who politically \u201ccame of age\u201d within this trend.\n\nI would hope this is true. I personally dislike the term \"millenial\" even as I am one myself. I think there are socially democratic feelings but I'm not sure of how much radicalization. But maybe there is more than I perceive.\n\n&gt; This trend is united in support of \u201cActually Existing Socialism\u201d historically and the continued\ncentrality of the \u201cFive Heads\u201d of Marxism-Leninism (Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao). They stress the importance of anti-imperialism to revolutionary practice in the \u201cbelly of the beast\u201d, and additionally support for national liberation struggles historically and today as well as support for national bourgeois governments which are targeted by U.S. imperialism (e.g. Iran, Syria). This trend upholds Stalin against Trotsky, views Khrushchev as a revisionist, and supports the USSR\u2019s interventions in \u201856 and \u201868. Social Democrats, anarchists, and others denigrate it as Stalinism and condemn its members as \u201ctankies\u201d. Those in the Maoist movement consider it to be revisionism.\n\nRelatively accurate. I would not say that USSR interventions in 1956 &amp; 1968 are always supported. I would say that Maoists have a broad view of what is revisionism, differing from person to person.\n\n&gt; The contemporary Marxist-Leninist trend views itself as the continuation of the world communist movement of the twentieth century, including the anti-imperialist struggles of the century more broadly. It proudly sees its own history as being that of the Russian Revolution, the Chinese Revolution, and the Cuban Revolution; in the U.S., its local heroes include the Black Panther Party, Assata Shakur, Angela Davis, and so on. Its study guides feature lots of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, and to a lesser degree Stalin and Mao. Its propaganda features, for instance, Thomas Sankara, Fred Hampton, and Fidel Castro.\n\nI would still say that a good amount draw on Stalin and Mao. Otherwise I would say that broad canon of anti-imperialist struggle is recognized which is a positive for further internationalism.\n\n&gt; ...Since imperialism still dominates and proletarian revolution is still the aim, ML is considered to be a still-applicable way of approaching politics. Dictatorship of the proletariat is still considered necessary, as is a vanguard party run along democratic centralist lines. \n\nI believe this is broadly the case with comrades here, there and everywhere. DoTP is central as is a vanguard party.","created_utc":1520045598,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"intlnews","body":" &gt; We believe there are several positive aspects of U.S. MLism that have drawn millennials into its orbit.\n\nIt is my hope that's the case, but I'm a bit skeptical. \n\n&gt; First, MLism, as a revolutionary trend, provides an alternative to the reformist wing of the nascent socialist movement led by the right wing of the DSA, the Jacobin milieu, and the movement around Bernie Sanders. New radicals who were unsatisfied by the prospects of social democracy or the Democratic Party have found a viable option in Marxism-Leninism, which explicitly calls for the total overthrow of the bourgeois State by any means necessary.\n\nThat is undeniably good. ML is a viable option which opposes the horrible aspects of social democracy in the U$.\n\n&gt; Second, MLism prides itself on organizational discipline. This aspect attracted a lot of militants to Leninism in the late 60s due to the disarray of loose New Left organizations such as the original Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). These activists came to realize that \u201cstructureless\u201d or \u201cnon-hierarchical\u201d formations often meant in practice the despotism of unelected, media-appointed leaders, combined with anti-democratic practices like the refusal of the minority (or worse, individuals) to bow to the decisions of the majority. Similarly, post-Occupy radicals have turned to more disciplined organizational structures after participating in a movement without clearly defined organizational structures or articulated political goals. Organizational discipline has also appealed to ex-anarchists from the Seattle \u201899 tradition, some of whom have adopted Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and other Leninist trends.\n\nThis is also good. I personally feel the structuralessness hurt Occupy and ked to its collapse. Taking this as the reality, it seems like a good development without question. \n\n&gt; Third, MLism is a trend known for its strong stance on national liberation and anti-imperialism. In the U.S. in particular, the early CPUSA was known for its commitment to Black liberation, especially through organizing sharecroppers in Alabama and placing an emphasis on Harry Haywood\u2019s \u201cBlack Belt\u201d thesis, the idea that African-Americans constituted an oppressed nation within the United States. Today, the ML trend participates in popular anti-racist struggles, in particular #BlackLivesMatter as well as anti-imperialist struggles, particularly against U.S. wars in the Middle East. Today\u2019s ML groups largely call for self-determination for oppressed nations as well as the return of land to indigenous peoples. For many young militants, especially radicals of color, this focus on self-determination is a breath of fresh air compared to the class-reductionism that crops up in other U.S. leftist trends.\n\nI would broadly say that is true but some support \"self-determination\" that shouldn't be supported like the efforts of the Kurds, for example. \n\n&gt; Fourth, Marxist-Leninists generally hold positive views of the 20th century socialist states. For those who wish to draw positive lessons from this experience, MLism presents an appealing alternative to the Cold War anti-communism often propagated by layers of the reformist, anarchist, and Trotskyist trends.\n\nThat is a positive but I think there is also a good amount of anti-revisionists out there and those who hold positive views but are critical, which is needed.\n\n&gt; We have outlined how the Marxist-Leninist trend in the U.S. sees itself today, and how it presents itself to the broader Left. But as Marxists, we are not content with knowing how things present themselves to be; we seek to understand their real content. To that end, let us explore the contemporary practices of the political groups which are central to the contemporary ML trend in the U.S.: the WWP, PSL, and FRSO. How do the political convictions of MLs today play out in practice?\n\nI look forward to that part of the essay.","created_utc":1520045648,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

There was a lack of prioritizing discussion of short-term and long-term goals, analysis of our juncture, or general strategy...In short, we restricted our struggle to the plane of ideas. Socialists win over workers by organizing alongside them to improve material conditions and build institutional power, not by handing them newspapers or shouting ideas to them...Despite our lack of ties with the class, WWP at least acknowledged the need for mass organization in the abstract, if only to produce new MLs...But by keeping our mass organizations as ours rather than as heterogeneous formations with political contradictions, they remained marginal, unable to draw in broad layers of the class or foster a culture of healthy debate. And this was not simply a result of unfavorable conditions, but had been the case for decades...the vague, unstated strategy in WWP is that \u201cparty-building\u201d consists in holding street demonstrations, slowly recruiting more people, until we reach some \u201ccritical mass\u201d, at which point we would be ready for revolution. But despite organizing a hugely successful march, WWP was unable to capitalize on it and build any long-term mass base. To us, this raises deep doubts about the overall orientation towards protests in general, and about WWP\u2019s practical work in particular.\n\nThese are just snippets but this is undoubtedly biting criticism of the WWP, something that is truly needed. I still remember how the WWP had a loosely attended panel at Left Forum, handed out newspapers and one person said that Russia was a wanna-be imperialist power which couldn't be imperialist due to U$ efforts. Their story does raise some significant doubts about the WWP. \n\n&gt; Neither of us have been members of PSL or FRSO, and thus cannot give as detailed an evaluation as we have with WWP. However, based on our observations and experience working with these groups, our sense is that they are better organized but still fall into at least some of the same traps of WWP.\n\nThat doesn't seem good. I think we need some of those in the PSL and FRSO to provide more insight.\n\n&gt; The PSL program is mostly concerned with the state of U.S. capitalism, the need for a multinational Party, and the features of a future socialist government (the latter of which takes up almost half of the entire program). It proclaims the necessity of a revolutionary socialist party but it does not provide elaboration on what such a party should look like or how it is to be built. There is analysis of the current state of U.S. capitalism, and a blueprint for a future socialist society, but how do we get from Point A to Point B? The entire realm of strategy is skipped over. We do not feel that this document grapples sufficiently with the strategy and tactics needed to forge a path forward in our juncture. This is a major, yet unacknowledged, weakness among today\u2019s ML groups.\n\nWell that is an area to work on.\n\n&gt; While we can only give our impressions, we believe that PSL, while more organized than WWP, falls into the same \u201cactivist subculture\u201d mindset, focused on street protests and agitation rather than deep organizing projects. We attended the People's Congress of Resistance (PCoR) back in September 2017, organized by PSL as an attempt at building a mass organization that was capable of providing anti-Trump resistance independent from co-option by the Democratic Party.\n\nWell if what you say is true that is unfortunate to say the least.","created_utc":1520045745,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"intlnews","body":" &gt; The actual purpose of PCoR is a bit unclear, but based on this document it seems to be to (1) bring together multiple movements, in a sort of \u201cmovement of movements\u201d and (2) propagate a political platform. These goals do make some amount of sense. The first would aim to rectify our current weakness by crafting a more immediately powerful coalition or united front out of already existing activist organizations, which taken all together do represent something of a power. And the second would address the urgent need to articulate and propagate an alternative vision for society, against the idea that capitalism is the only possible system which has been dominant since the end of the Cold War. But in practice, we believe PCoR fell short. Rather than bringing together various groups of activists to work on common projects, in practice PCoR attempted to to conjure up its movement of movements through propaganda without a practical basis for coalition.\n\nThat is deeply unfortunate if that was the case. I remember that they promoted it like it was a 21st century Soviet.\n\n&gt; The PCoR convention was two days. The first day consisted mostly of speeches and breakout groups. These speeches were mostly of a political rather than strategic nature; they were focused on the evils of U.S. capitalism and the need for militant resistance with less emphasis on how to build such a resistance. In the breakout groups there was discussion around tactics used by the constituent groups, but not as much around what our plan forward would be. Overall, while the list of speakers was inspiring, we left with little besides inspiration. And though many of the breakout groups featured interesting presenters and were oriented towards worthwhile tasks, such as building an alternative media hub, there was little measurable progress made towards these goals (nor a plan to move forward), which were taken up in the abstract rather than concretely. Without a clear goal, the discussions drifted towards the sharing of anecdotes, frustrating some in attendance.\n\nWhile inspiration is something, like I've felt after going to Left Forum conferences, I think moving toward goals is even more important. \n\n&gt; The second day was focused on passing resolutions. There were two types of resolutions: action-oriented and organizational. For those frustrated by the lack of tangible progress on the first day, this promised to be more rewarding. The action-oriented resolutions were written by various attendees, submitted to the organizers of the event, and passed by a verbal vote of the entire conference. These resolutions all more or less consisted in deciding that the PCoR stand in solidarity with various (largely protest-based) movements. While we were, of course, happy to state our solidarity, we again lacked clear or measurable goals or even first steps towards action. In similar fashion to the WWP program, these action-oriented resolutions were more demands than actionable steps towards building a united front. The focus fell more on protests and conferences than on deep organizing projects. It was fitting that PCoR ended with a march to the White House, demonstrating its emphasis on fleeting moments of expression.\n\nHmm. So, its all about activism. But there is a start of something there, no?\n\n&gt; After the action-oriented resolutions, we moved on to organizational resolutions. The organizational resolutions had been pre-written by the convening organizations, and were again passed by verbal vote of the entire conference. These resolutions focused on growing the congress and spreading its ideas\n\nThat doesn't seem good they were easily pre-written to be honest, but go on.\n\n&gt; Out of the above organizational resolutions, PCoR\u2019s primary strategy going forward seems to be to spread its manifesto. Since the congress, PCoR\u2019s main activity in local areas has been to host reading groups around the manifesto, and to host trainings for its organizers to prepare them to host such reading groups. Rather than developing a strategy for building roots in a mass base, PCoR seeks to grow through propaganda, placing primacy on its program and hoping that it will win the day. Like WWP\u2019s Global May Day Strike, the strategy is to spread ideas instead of concretely organizing within the class. In its basic features, PCoR\u2019s strategy seems to be inspired by the success of the Labour Party\u2019s 2017 manifesto, even down to the name \u201cSociety for the Many,\u201d a direct reference to the framing used by the Labour Party. But as much as we may wish, PCoR is not the Labour Party, which already has a mass base. Our strategy at this juncture must focus on how to build our own mass base through genuine long term organizing; we cannot hope for our manifesto to light a sudden spark.\n\nI agree building a mass base is fundamentally important without question. But the other activities aren't totally worthless.\n\n&gt; In summary, we left PCoR unclear what had been accomplished, and feeling that we lacked clear goals going forward. There was little discussion around strategy and the purpose of the congress, and the organizational democracy that existed was mostly cosmetic. It did seem like the conveners of the conference had goals or a plan for the future, but as \u201cparticipants\u201d in the conference we felt more like audience members. Since the event itself, there have been some local report-backs and reading groups around the Manifesto in various cities, as well as a training centered around hosting these events. So far, there has been no mass response, nor does it seem that PCoR has achieved a practical unity between a broader layer of activist groups. In short, PSL\u2019s major project in 2017 was more of a networking event for activists than an attempt to build a mass base in the unorganized. This failure mirrors WWP\u2019s attempt to ignite a spark with a big protest, thereby skipping over the hard work of base-building.\n\nThat does not seem good at all! I think that it still was a valiant effort however.","created_utc":1520045804,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"intlnews","body":" &gt; FRSO\u2019s party documents contain a fair bit more detail on strategy compared to those of WWP and PSL. For example, their document \"Class in the U.S. and Our Strategy for Revolution\" details the class composition of the United States, the need to build a communist party, and the need for a \u201cstrategic alliance\u201d between the working class and the oppressed nations. Another example, their 7th Congress documents, detail an analysis of the U.S. economy and political sphere while proposing strategy for working within the various movements as well as within the unions. This is a clear step above the WWP and PSL programs, which do not discuss strategy or the need to build a party that does not yet exist. In this vein, we also see FRSO\u2019s self-identification as a \u201cpre-party formation\u201d rather than a party to be a positive thing.\n\nWell that is a good step in the right direction without a doubt. \n\n&gt; In practice, it does seem that FRSO is more concerned with base-building than WWP in that their cadre focus on specific areas of work, dedicating their time and energy into certain mass struggles instead of jumping around to different protests. They have many members in unions, national liberation struggles, the student movement, and other areas. We see this as an improvement of the protest-centric model practiced by WWP. However, we still have hesitations about FRSO\u2019s organizational structure, which we will discuss later.\n\nWell a different model for an organization is undeniably a positive without question.\n\n&gt; We have tried to paint an accurate picture of the practice of modern U.S. ML organizations, including their weaknesses. We have identified several key errors including overemphasis on protesting, failure to conduct base-building work, and the placement of political line above material organizing. These problems flow from the idea that a small group of people can create a political line and win the class over to it, rather than building a program with the class through mass struggle. We feel that these issues are not sufficiently discussed among the ML milieu because they praise these organizations for their political line rather than their practice.\n\nI don't think its the praise for these organizations results in these issues not being discussed but would rather say it is due to the fracturing of the U$ left which has led to many unfortunate consequences. \n\n&gt; We have explored the ML trend in its strengths as well as what we believe are its weaknesses in practice. But we have yet to discuss the primary distinction between ML groups and all others: their organizational form, the democratic centralist cadre Party. What does this form consist of, and is it a proper organizational form for our period?\n\nHere we go with the criticism of democratic centralism which the Koreans use to great effect. It should not be abandoned.\n\n&gt; Organizationally, U.S. ML groups operate along \u201cdemocratic centralist\u201d lines. The shorthand definition of \u201cdemcen\u201d is often given as \u201cfreedom of discussion, unity of action.\u201d In other words, full discussion is permitted on an issue, but once it is voted on, the minority must submit to the majority in carrying out the voted-on plan.\n\nI think iron discipline, as Stalin called it, is important in keeping a party together and resisting subversion\n\n&gt; Democratic centralism, as practiced today, implies more than this simple formulation. For U.S. MLs, it means mimicking the organizational structure of the Comintern groups. There are no\nfactions allowed, \u201cparty line\u201d cannot be disagreed with publicly, and lower bodies submit to higher bodies.\n\nHaving no factions is a positive however as it preserves organizational unity. If those in Juche Korea can do it, then why not the U$?\n\n&gt; How does this practice of \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d measure up with historical Leninism? The common mythology would suggest that these practices were integral to the Bolshevik tendency since its foundation in 1902. But as Albert Szymanski explained, the road to building a revolutionary working-class Party in Russia was quite arduous. The \u201cLeninist Party\u201d as commonly understood today did not exist in Russia until around 1921\n\nFrom what I remember from looking into this when writing about Syria and social democracy, democratic centralism was a principle outlined before the success of the Great October Socialist Revolution. I wouldn't totally trust Mr. Revisionist, Albert Szymanski. Why not look at Lenin's work itself? This is utterly weak reasoning.","created_utc":1520045851,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"intlnews","body":" &gt; If Szymanski is correct in arguing that the Leninist party as we understand it today was not a practical reality during the Russian Revolution or the preceding period, it remains possible that the idea of the Leninist party had already been formalized, if not yet made reality.\n\nThis makes me wonder why Szymanski was even used. This supposition is not what Marxist-Leninist thinking is about. It is what exists in reality, not some theoretical nonesense.\n\n&gt; Lenin\u2019s What Is To Be Done? was written as early as 1901, and has for decades been seen as the canonical text on the topic of the cadre party, a new type of organization made up of professional revolutionaries. But according to Hal Draper, to understand WITBD? in this way is to absorb a popular anti-communist misreading of the text. His core argument in The Myth of Lenin\u2019s \u201cConcept of The Party\u201d is as follows\n\nPerhaps some interpret it that way, but I think more than one time, more than one work, Lenin talks about building a party, something Stalin discusses as well, at length.\n\n&gt; Draper presents a compelling case that WITBD was in fact highly contingent upon the conditions of illegality at the time in Tsarist Russia, rather than being a universal statement on a \u201cparty of a new type.\u201d His fairly straightforward exegesis of WITBD and Lenin\u2019s later comments on the text provide helpful debunkings of anti-Leninist cliches: the myth of the leading role given to intellectuals by Lenin (actually taken from Kautsky and in practice much more true among the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, and consistently criticized by Lenin), or that Lenin wanted a party of only full time, thus not working-class, professional revolutionaries (whereas Lenin meant by \u201cprofessional\u201d only that they would be dedicated, trained activists who spent a great deal of their free time doing revolutionary activity). On this point about professional revolutionaries, Draper also argues against the traditional Leninist understanding, saying that Lenin was aware that only the core of the party could be trained activists, and that furthermore his argument in support of this activist core was specific to the context of illegality. In that context, it was important that the party be kept alive by a consistent core of activists, so that the constant eradication of the party through arrest and exile could be evaded. Furthermore, the Russian Social-Democratic party at that point hardly existed, and it would take dedicated work to craft its organizations and bring a national party center into being. Once conditions of legality were achieved in 1905, however, Draper argues that Lenin changed his line\n\nHere we go with more theorizing. Why not look at Lenin's works themselves than just depending on one author. This is again lazy writing and reasoning to say the least.\n\n&gt; Given the instability of the idea of \u201ccadre party\u201d as an idea in Lenin, it becomes necessary to trace the history of the term \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d within the RSDLP. According to Lars T. Lih, the term \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d was actually introduced by the Mensheviks in 1905 . The political freedom won during the 1905 revolution allowed the RSDLP to increase their internal democracy, in particular the selection of party leaders through elections. Bolsheviks and Mensheviks alike agreed upon increasing party democracy given the newly won freedoms. But with few exceptions, Lenin only used the term \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d during 1906-07 and 1920-21.\u201d In each of these two periods, Lenin\u2019s use of the term was triggered by groups to which he was opposed: by the Mensheviks in 1906-07 and the Democratic Centralist group headed by N Osinsky and others in 1920. In neither period do we find any systematic exposition of the meaning of the term.\u201d \n\nOnce again, this analysis is weak and depends on one analysis. The concept was outlined by Lenin as noted by the Marxists Internet Archive and the works on Lenin on there. Otherwise, it would make no sense that this would be in the constitution of Juche Korea!

{"author":"intlnews","body":" &gt; Let us explore one instance of Lenin\u2019s use of \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d and see how it compares to the modern ML conception. In May 1906, the Central Committee (CC) of the RSDLP sent out a communication that stated that in the Party press and meetings, \u201ceverybody must be allowed full freedom to express his personal opinions and to advocate his individual views\u201d. However, in public meetings, Party members \u201cshould refrain from conducting agitation that runs counter to congress decisions\u201d and should not \u201ccall for action that runs counter to congress decisions, or propose resolutions that are out of harmony with congress decisions.\u201d This more or less maps onto the modern ML understanding of \u201cdemcen\u201d, that disagreements should be reserved for internal meetings. Let us see Lenin\u2019s response. We find it necessary to quote him at length...few observations must be made here. First, Lenin is advocating that public criticism of party line should be allowed, as long as it does not impede carrying out actions. According to Lenin, a party member should be free to publicly disagree with the decision to take part in the Duma elections before or after the elections. This makes sense to us; if a party member is going around telling people to boycott the election, this undermines the party efforts, which in turn makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of participating in the Duma. Second, the example Lenin gives is tied to immediately relevant practical work. Today\u2019s ML groups take \u201cunity of action\u201d to be public agreement on not just organizing work, but also, for example, whether or not the USSR was socialist, or if the Syrian government deserves support. Imagine if the RSDLP had a united public party line on the French Revolution! And further, this CC declaration, which lines up with the modern ML understanding of \u201cdemcen\u201d, was actually passed by a Menshevik-majority CC! In short, this passage demonstrates that a reading of today\u2019s ML \u201cdemocratic centralist\u201d practices onto Lenin has a weak textual basis.\n\nI broadly still support the idea of democratic centralism. Perhaps the ML groups you mention have it wrong but the concept itself is one that should be used without question. \n\n&gt; Lenin picks up this term again during 1920-21, when the RSFSR was facing civil war against the White Army and the CPSU was riddled with heavy internal conflict. This is when the practice of \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d as understood today was fully utilized for the first time. Lenin uses the term to emphasize centralism as a necessary strategy in the context of civil war. Lih concludes...Lih\u2019s argument is thus that the \u201cdemocratic centralist vanguard\u201d as an organizational form did not come into being until 1921, four years after the revolution and as a product of the period of civil war. This raises the question: is the \u201cdemocratic centralist\u201d cadre Party an appropriate form in a different contexts? Let us see what some of the canonical texts on this organizational form have to say on this question.\n\nYes, Democratic centralism is appropriate in other contexts if adapted to the situation. Of course hew as writing in a different environment than now but his ideas are long lasting without question. \n\n\u00a0&gt; First, let\u2019s consider Chapter VIII: The Party from Stalin\u2019s Foundations of Leninism. In the very first sentence of the chapter, Stalin expresses that \u201cunder [non-revolutionary] conditions the Party neither had nor could have had that great and decisive importance which it acquired afterwards, under conditions of open revolutionary clashes.\u201d We are decidedly not in a period of \u201copen revolutionary clashes\u201d in the U.S. in 2018.\n\nTrue, but that does not make his ideas any less valid now as they were then.\n\n&gt; Stalin argues for \u201cthe necessity for a new party, a militant party, a revolutionary party, one bold enough to lead the proletarians in the struggle for power, sufficiently experienced to find its bearings amidst the complex conditions of a revolutionary situation, and sufficiently flexible to steer clear of all submerged rocks in the path to its goal.\u201d His rationale for this new organizational form is that the struggle had entered a new period \u201cof open class collisions, of revolutionary action by the proletariat, of proletarian revolution, a period when forces are being directly mustered for the overthrow of imperialism and the seizure of power by the proletariat.\u201d Again, these are not the conditions that we face. \n\nThe situation today is much more dire but his words still have staying power and such a militant, revolutionary party is needed without question. ","created_utc":1520045999,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"intlnews","body":" &gt; Further on in the chapter, Stalin characterizes \u201cthe Party as the embodiment of unity of will, unity incompatible with the existence of factions.\u201d This is one of the more controversial features of \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d as practiced by groups like PSL and FRSO. Stalin justifies his point with the following quote from Lenin...Whether or not this organizational form can extend beyond these conditions of \u201cacute civil war\u201d is up for debate, but was not being asserted as such by either Lenin or Stalin\n\nTrue but they are focusing on a time of acute civil war which was instigated by imperialist forces. The words \"acute civil war\" could easily be replaced by imperialist-induced conflict or something along those lines to apply to today.\n\n&gt; Moreover, let us consider what the official terms of admission (known as the \u201c21 Conditions\u201d) into the Comintern had to say about organizational structure...Again, \u201cacute civil war\u201d is listed as the justification of highly centralized bodies of authority and a ban on factions. Whether or not the ban on factions in 1921 was justified is outside the scope of this paper. But it has been sufficiently argued that the arguments put forth by the Comintern were based on their own historical circumstances of the Russian Civil War and anticipated revolutionary upheavals in Western Europe. We cannot underestimate the impact the context of those revolutionary years had on the Comintern parties. They needed highly centralized organizations that could lead insurrection and military struggle, and they needed them to come into being very quickly. \n\nTrue but we need centralized parties today as well to ward off subversion from capitalist states.\n\n&gt; During the Second World Congress of the Comintern, held from July-August of 1920 and at which the above terms of admission were adopted, \u201cacute civil war\u201d was a reality, not lofty or theoretical phrasing...Furthermore, these practices were put into place by very large organizations even outside of Russia, not small groups with a few hundred people like the U.S. ML organizations. Right after the Second Congress of the Comintern, the German Communist Party grew to 350,000 members after merging with the left wing of the Independent Social Democratic Party. The newly formed French Communist Party started with 150,000 members. The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia claimed 170,000 members. By contrast, no U.S. ML organization today comes close to passing a thousand members, by our estimation.\n\nTrue. But democratic centralism still has a value today and can be used as a guiding principle for organizations. ","created_utc":1520046080,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"intlnews","body":" &gt; In summary, we believe the practice of \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d within modern ML groups in the U.S. to be disconnected with real conditions. We do not face a revolutionary period of acute civil war as described by the Second Congress of the Comintern or by Stalin, who both emphasize that context as the justification for the pseudo-military organization of the party. Furthermore, historical example demonstrates that a tightly disciplined democratic centralist party is not necessary to carry out revolution, as there was not one present during, for example, the Russian Revolution, or the Cuban Revolution. Finally, we believe the textual foundations for contemporary democratic centralism in Lenin\u2019s What Is To Be Done?, which became a bible of the party building movement of the 70s and remains so today, to be based on a misreading of the text that ignores the context of the debates raging within Social Democracy during the early 20th century.\n\nPerhaps we can look at debates within social democracy but I think it is better to look at strategies that were used in reality like those of democratic centralism which did have a role in the Russian revolution. As for Cuba it had certain conditions of revolution, like with China, which were not the same as those in Russia. Perhaps ML groups in the U$ do not use democratic centralism as they should, but the principle itself, used by the Soviets, and later in Juche Korea, is a valuable one without question.\n\n&gt; As Marxists (and avid students of Lenin), we have a generally more favorable view of ML \u201cpolitical line\u201d than that of social democracy or anarchism. By \u201cpolitical line\u201d, we mean the ML theoretical framework and historical analysis, such as its conception of the State, view on national oppression, appraisal of which countries are socialist, etc. However, we must consider the significance of \u201cline\u201d in the context of the organizational and strategic shortcomings we outlined above.\n\nA political line is vital to a correct ML position on issues across the world. \n\n&gt; With this dictum, New Communist Movement radicals felt they were given carte blanche to place absolute emphasis on their \u201cparty line\u201d and their ideas, fuelling sectarian hostilities between groups. It became a rallying cry, \u201cquoted endlessly\u201d by the dogmatist party-building efforts of the NCM . This hyper-focus on \u201cline\u201d has not died out with time.\n\nIf that was genuinely the case then that degraded the NCM.\n\n&gt; An emphasis on line and on certain historical positions is central to the way that today\u2019s ML groups practice democratic centralism. \u201cFreedom of discussion, unity of action\u201d has a different meaning if we, like today\u2019s ML groups, apply it not just to strategy and tactics, but foremost to ideas and \u201cpositions\u201d. In this context, \u201cfreedom of discussion\u201d means freedom to debate about which ideas are the correct ideas, and \u201cunity of action\u201d must necessarily mean that once the debate is had, everyone must agree to the same ideas. This was a common practice during the NCM.\n\nThat ML group formulation may be problematic without question. I don't think everyone agreeing to the same ideas is helpful in promoting fruitful discourse.\n\n&gt; Of course \u201cunity of action\u201d is required when carrying out a strategy or tactic; to do otherwise would be organizational self-sabotage. This sense of \u201cunity of action\u201d is understood by any group that attempts to carry out a democratically agreed upon action. But none of this implies that every member must have the same ideas or the same interpretation of the strategy. This is an idealist misunderstanding of the original formulation.\n\nExactly. Perhaps these ML groups are engaging in strategy in the wholy wrong way.","created_utc":1520046147,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"intlnews","body":" &gt; Consolidating an organization around its political line, when coupled with the type of \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d practiced by these groups, leads to unhelpful practices such as the prohibition of public disagreement on line. But what is the practical value in having to \u201ckeep quiet\u201d on internal disagreements, especially on historical or international topics that have very little direct bearing on our practical tasks as it stands (such as whether China is socialist)? Or on relevant modern theoretical questions which do not have a definitive answer yet? We do not see the value in pretending to agree with an organization\u2019s political line publicly. It may even be deceptive or dishonest in organizing spaces. Further, even if these positions turn out to be \u201ccorrect\u201d, it does not automatically follow that building organizational independence around them is strategic.\n\nThat does seem to be a problem. There should be a debate on organizational positions on certain issues \n\n&gt; This method, and a hyper-focus on line in general, stifles discussion between comrades across organizational lines, leading to lack of openness to criticism and debate among MLs. When was the last time an ML paper published two opposing views or a comradely criticism of another group?\n\nI can't think of a time that a ML paper published two opposing groups or a criticism of another group, no.\n\n&gt; These things can and should be a healthy feature of the socialist ecosystem as we strive to get our bearings for the first time in decades. We believe that open dialogue not only with other MLs but with other trends entirely can only strengthen the socialist movement.\n\nOpen dialogue is important, I'll agree with.\n\n&gt; The consolidation of U.S. ML organizations around political line is directly related to their deficiencies in practice. In one sense, U.S. MLism is focused on \u201cpolitics\u201d: WWP, PSL, etc. are hailed primarily for their \u201cpolitical positions\u201d with respect to historical and current events (who is socialist, who is worthy of support, etc.). In another sense, though, this approach is profoundly apolitical. It is apolitical in that it is defined by ideas, not practice and strategy. The Marxist Theory of Knowledge teaches us that practice is the sole criterion of truth. Not internal consistency, not logical proof. So what does it mean for a trend to be defined by its theory rather than its practice?\n\nThat also seems problematic. There should be more internal discussion on varied groups.\n\n&gt; We believe the conception of \u201cline\u201d as an end in itself is detrimental to both theory and practice. Placing importance on \u201cline\u201d in this way severs theory from practice by suggesting that theory can be \u201ccorrect\u201d without practice. This is an impossibility, as the \u201ccorrectness\u201d of theory is defined foremost by its practical results. This focus on \u201cline\u201d is often justified by the idea that without \u201ccorrect line\u201d, an organization or movement will necessary degenerate into reformism or bourgeois ideology. However, we believe that the examples of the CPUSA in the 1940s and the rise of Eurocommunism suggest that having a rigid political line does not prevent degeneration. If there is any organizational form or political line that is immune from degeneration, we believe that it has yet to be discovered. Further, we believe that having good theory is not synonymous with having highly specific positions on historical questions.\n\nPerhaps so. I think a mass line, as notes by Mao, standing with thr proletariat, should be used by varied organizations, in the U$ &amp; beyond.\n\n&gt; More and more communists are being educated through the internet, whether that be through Twitter or marxists.org. While having centuries of communist thought at one\u2019s fingertips is no doubt a progressive development, this style of education, disconnected from practice, can have a negative effect on political education. Internet communists learn Leninism as a set of positions\u201d on historical and modern events, or at worst, a set of dogmas and truisms. Then, new \u201cconverts\u201d to MLism (or any other tendency) seek an \u201caffinity group\u201d (almost like a hobby club), and naturally look to WWP, PSL, and FRSO due to their \u201cpositions\u201d. \n\nI would say I do that to an extent but also am very independently thought. I work to learn about communism myself through a journey of self-discovery which I'm not sure everyone does.\n\n&gt; Strategy and tactics are rarely brought up in online communities, if at all; it is enough that they have the \u201ccorrect line\u201d on whether this or that country is socialist, or which forces are deserving of our support in certain conflicts, etc. It is taken as a given that joining the organization with the most similar positions as one\u2019s own is the correct strategic move. We believe this lack of critical thought around what sort of political unity is necessary in this juncture fails to account for the nascent character of the socialist movement as well as the primacy of practice over ideology.\n\nPerhaps it does and perhaps there should be more critical thought!

I wouldn't consider my ML views an identity or aesthetic but a political worldview, which I'm still developing, without question. And yes, having/treating ML as a \"fandom\" is not good.\n\n&gt; In summary, the idea that U.S. MLism is superior to other tendencies due solely to its \u201cline\u201d is fundamentally flawed because it severs theory from practice and reduces Marxism into a set of opinions (or moral judgements) on historical and current events and actors. This approach empties Marxism of its revolutionary character as a guide to practical activity and instead turns it into an identity or dogma. This represents a failure to fully break from the liberal conception of politics as a list of personal opinions rather than a worldview that allows us to analyze and (more importantly) change the world. Given that, if we are honest, we do not yet have a \u201creadymade\u201d Marxism to simply \u201capply\u201d to the United States in 2018, we feel that organizational independence around a specific tendency (in this case, Marxism-Leninism) is premature and stifles theoretical development. We believe it would be a positive development if the ML trend instead placed strategy and tactics within the larger movement at the center of its discourse.\n\nThat is not a bad suggestion to say the least. Also such \"superiority\" is undeniably Eurocentric I would say.\n\n&gt; Although WWP does not have an official position on the Trotsky/Stalin question, most of the leadership are more partial towards Trotsky. However, both WWP and PSL self-identify as Marxist-Leninist\n\nWell that is a good development. I see how some could see them as \"neo-Trotskyist\" however.\n\n&gt;\u00a0 While FRSO today recognizes the USSR as a socialist country up until its collapse in 1991, the original party line upheld the restorationist thesis. \n\nI see. It means they are a bit revisionist, right?\n\n&gt; MLism in the U.S. is seen as the continuation of a revolutionary tradition from Marx to Mao. In reality, instead of a coherent \u201cMarxist-Leninist\u201d trend, there is some amalgam of Marcyist Trotskyism and Mao Zedong Thought. What should be immediately apparent is that U.S. MLism is hardly the product of an unbroken torch-passing of Marxist thought; rather, it is a trend formed out of multiple lineages of U.S. communist organization, forged from the practice of the New Left up through the collapse of the socialist bloc. However, this history is often concealed by its adherents.\n\nTrue, MLism is developed over time and from many different struggles, improved and refined.","created_utc":1520046268,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"intlnews","body":" &gt; What is today understood as MLism contains many analyses from its component parts (Marcyism, MZT) which are in tension with MLs\u2019 self-image as representative of the global communist tradition. For instance, while the ML trend today rejects the thesis that capitalism was restored by the Soviet Union itself, most of the anti-revisionist framework which grew out of exactly this thesis still stands, including the categorization of the CPSU and its client parties as \u201crevisionist\u201d after Khrushchev\u2019s \u201cSecret Speech\u201d in 1956 (or earlier). All of these positions, as well as the entire \u201cfive heads\u201d tradition and the construction of a direct line from Marx to Mao, served originally as ideological justification for the Sino-Soviet Split.\n\nI don't believe that criticizing Khrushchev for revisionism is bad at all.\n\n&gt; considering the disastrous policies of the Chinese Communist Party due to the split\n\nThe Khrushchevites ked to the split not the Chinese! Come on now. What is this junk!\n\n&gt; as well as the fact that the Vietnamese and Cuban parties, among others, refused to adopt the Chinese orientation against the Soviet Union\n\nThat is because the Cubans felt more allied with the Soviets but they did work to keep their independence. I would like to know more about the Cuban reasons for siding with the Soviets. The Chinese did work with the Vietnamese as well.\n\n&gt; it does not seem to be a given that we should accept the basic anti-revisionist framework, which is exactly what the contemporary ML trend does without even realizing.\n\nPerhaps. But I see no problem with anti-revisionism.\n\n&gt; It is mistaken for the ML trend in the U.S. to view itself as cut from the exact same cloth as current or historical self-described Marxist-Leninist parties across the world for purely ideological reasons.\n\nOk, fair enough. \n\n&gt; Despite the fact that U.S. MLs \u201cuphold\u201d the Cuban Communist Party, or Mao Zedong\u2019s contributions, or the FARC, or the PFLP, it does not follow that U.S. MLs are a part of a united\ntradition with all of these groups.\n\nThat is a fair point. Perhaps there should be efforts to create a united tradition.\n\n&gt; As materialists, we must recognize that an organization or trend must be appraised by its practice, not by its own words or ideology. One cannot simply \u201cidentify with\u201d a swath of historical Parties and inherit their success and credentials. We believe this trend of appealing to the authority of other movements and parties is an important way that U.S. MLism seeks to legitimize itself while concealing its actual history and practice.\n\nPerhaps it is and if that is the case it isn't a positive at all.\n\n&gt; We have argued that U.S. MLism is not some continuation of an unbroken, eternal, global tradition of Marxism-Leninism. Rather, it is a specific, historically contingent trend that encompasses a variety of lineages from U.S. Trotskyism to the Maoist NCM. In other words, \u201cMarxism-Leninism\u201d as used today is an abstraction that conceals its real content. And this real content allows us to explain its flawed practice. U.S. Trotskyists, as well as those who upheld the Mao Zedong Thought of the NCM, were always organized in sects. \n\nAnd there are still sects. There have been changes but some hasn't changed over the years. Yes, MLism in the U$ takes in many different threads.\n\n&gt; We believe our arguments suggest that U.S. Marxism-Leninism fits this definition. ML groups in the U.S. are defined primarily by and praised for their political program rather than their practice in organizing with the class. Programmatic standards are imposed onto the class instead of forged through struggle, as we saw when analyzing the protest strategy of WWP or PSL\u2019s use of PCoR. ML organizations cohere their membership around specific positions on historical and international events and actors, rather than on shared strategy of mobilizing and organizing various layers of the working class. Additionally, their dogmatic adherence to \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d as well as their focus on protests and sloganeering in practice cements them on an ideological basis rather than a strategic one.\n\nAn ideological basis is not a bad one but a strategic one is even more important, without question. \n\n&gt; While groups like the International Socialist Organization (ISO) and Socialist Alternative on the one hand and the PSL and WWP on the other have very different political positions, we believe their similarities outweigh their differences. Both sets of groups focus a great deal of energy on \u201cactivist culture\u201d and building their sect, while what separates them foremost is their signage at\ndemonstrations and their newspapers.\n\nThat's true. But it is really good to work with Trotskyists? I just am not sure about that.\n\n&gt; What\u2019s more important, in our evaluation, is the ways in which groups engage with and organize the class in order to build working-class institutional power. In that sense, the ISO, WWP, RCP, etc. are united in their status as sects rather than genuine mass organizations.\n\nPerhaps they are, but I doubt they'd work together. That seems unlikely.\n\n&gt; U.S. Trotskyist, Marcyist, and New Communist Movement groups rarely developed a mass base or grew beyond a few hundred members, even if at times the prospects were favorable. Everything from their intense focus on political line to their mode of organization guaranteed that they would remain marginalized. They never matched the level of mass organization that the broader Communist movement did because they tried to force themselves into existence in a completely ahistorical and backwards way, thinking that the essence of Leninism consisted in the tightening of discipline caused by the Civil War and the prospect and actuality of international revolution.\n\nWell we should learn from their mistakes and work to build better organizations and/or improve the ones we already have.\n\n&gt; But for the Trotskyists, the Marcyists, and the anti-revisionists, all it created was sects of greater or smaller size. We must acknowledge the objective limitations imposed by the state of class struggle, including, but not limited to, state repression, popular anti-communism, concessions made by the ruling class, and global counter-revolution. However, we maintain that the errors of the 60s and 70s Left contributed greatly to its collapse.\n\nYes, the limitations should be acknowledged even as we see these groups as sects.","created_utc":1520046410,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"intlnews","body":" &gt; We believe that U.S. MLism also fits this concept. In particular, our earlier argument on the history of \u201cdemocratic centralism\u201d suggests that U.S. MLism is disconnected from its own history and that its project has been to attempt to operate like historical parties that (1) had much more of a mass character and (2) were undergoing direct military conflict.\n\nWell MLs in the U$ should work to improve MLism to become more of a dynamic force.\n\n&gt; Consider, for example, the \u201cBasic Marxism-Leninism study plan\u201d. The guide contains several thousand pages of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, and one text by each Stalin and Mao. Not only does it exclude other Marxists from the era such as Gramsci, Luxemburg, and Luk\u00e1cs, but it also excludes more contemporary thinkers like Samir Amin or Etienne Balibar. On top of that, it consists solely of primary sources, providing no context for the highly specific debates that Lenin and Marx were engaging in. We do not believe this study guide to be an anomaly, but rather indicative of a wider trend of constructing an ML \u2018canon\u2019.\n\nPerhaps so, but reading those texts on their own is important to learning about MLism.\n\n&gt; For another example, consider the U.S. ML designation of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao as the most important theorists of Marxism. At best, the \u201cfive heads\u201d formulation downplays the contributions of other contemporary Marxists like Gramsci, Ho Chi Minh, and many others. At worst, these five figures are seen as a series of prophets that bring Pure Science down to the masses. It is often said that Bob Avakian of the RCP cult is not deserving of the \u201csixth head\u201d position. But the problem is not that Avakian is a false prophet; the problem is that there are prophets at all.\n\nI see. But a focus on Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao is totally understandable without question. \n\n&gt; Let's briefly return to Stalin\u2019s definition of Leninism as Marxism in a definite historical period (that of imperialism and proletarian revolution). Broadly speaking, the world is still in the era of imperialism as Lenin defined it. However, since Stalin\u2019s formulation: the Eastern Bloc has collapsed, formal colonialism has largely been replaced with neo-colonialism, Keynesianism has been replaced with neo-liberalism, and the United States has emerged as the dominant imperialist power. Are we in the same period that Stalin speaks of? Certainly a lot has changed.\n\nNo, circumstances have changed but we can use their works to inform our own views as MLs.\n\n&gt; Beyond that, Stalin emphasizes that Marx and Engels were in a pre-revolutionary period. When Stalin was writing, the Soviet Union had just been established and capitalist crisis was on the horizon. Throughout the 1920s, the Comintern pursued a fairly \u201cleftist\u201d strategy, hoping for revolution to spread to more countries. Are we in a revolutionary period in the U.S. right now? Clearly not. One could perceive a revolutionary situation arising sometime in the next several decades, but it is hardly on the immediate agenda. It is clear that our time is very different from Stalin\u2019s. While \u201cproletarian revolution\u201d is still our goal in general, it is not constitutive of our current period in the way that it was for Stalin\u2019s, in that we are not in a period of major revolutionary upheaval.\n\nThat's true and as such we should accurately analyse the current situation in the world today.\n\n&gt; Thus, we would argue that U.S. \u201cMarxism-Leninism\u201d is an historically contingent ideology rather than a modern iteration of Marxism fit for our time and place. \n\nWell that's biting. Is there not anything redeeming about it?\n\n&gt; However, that does not mean that we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. The successes and failures of 20th century socialist experiments have much to teach us moving forward, from how to organize unemployed workers to how to run a planned economy. Lenin is arguably the most important Marxist since Marx, and it would do us good to learn from him and the evolution of his thought, not a mythological, prophetic version of Lenin. While we should study and learn from Leninism, we should also study other trends: autonomism &amp; operaismo, Marxist-feminism, pre-war social democracy, and all historical anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist, anti-racist, and feminist movements.\n\nUndoubtedly that is what is needed. Lenin is an important theorist moving forward. \n\n&gt; The deep-seated dogmatism of U.S. MLism has become a fetter on the development of a genuinely new and creative Marxism for our era. We are not suggesting a return to anarchism or social democracy. Nor are we suggesting a return to the young Marx, or the \u201ctrue\u201d Lenin, or what-have-you. We are not abandoning Marxism-Leninism for Cliffite Trotskyism, or council communism, or any other trend. Our goal is to escape the sect system altogether, of which the contemporary U.S. ML trend consists. Thus, we are in favor of abandoning U.S. \u201cMarxism-Leninism\u201d in favor of an ecumenical approach to Marxism, which includes the historical contributions of the communist movement in general.\n\nThat would be a good way forward undoubtedly and help to bring an end to the murderous empire. \n\n&gt; We do not have the answers, and we think the first step to finding them is to admit our ignorance. Tentatively though, we would argue that base-building is the primary task of our current juncture. Historically, social democracy and then the Communist movement based their support on the existing strong base of trade union organization. But today, trade unions are at a historic weak point. Without a mass base of working class institutions, we will not have the power or basis to build a revolutionary working-class party. This means building working-class infrastructure on all fronts: tenants unions and workers\u2019 co-ops, but also institutions of culture, leisure, art, sport, etc. We must also engage with popular struggles such as BLM. In other words, we must build a proletarian civil society.\n\nThat is a worthwhile goal and a start to moving forward. It should be a goal without question. Still we must remain critical. \n\n&gt; Building working-class infrastructure must go hand-in-hand with party-building. There are no shortcuts to building a Party; without doing the daily grind of organizing on a mass basis, we will never get there. For the immediate tasks at hand, we believe that a relatively lower level of political unity is needed than is practiced in most Marxist sects. We also believe that we cannot necessarily know ahead of time what organizational form will achieve revolution, as several historical examples demonstrate that revolution is not necessarily carried out by a single, centralized revolutionary vanguard.\n\nPerhaps so but perhaps we can look back to workable organizational forms in the past, used in other countries, used in other revolutions.","created_utc":1520046510,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"intlnews","body":" &gt; For those in the Marxist-Leninist trend who have already joined organizations, our recommendation moving forward would be to place more of an emphasis on base-building rather than street protests and \u201cactivist networking\u201d. We find it encouraging that some ML groups have already begun this work. For instance, New York City branch of PSL has opened the Justice Center en el Barrio, a community center where they hold fitness classes, open mics, and other programming. This space was also used to collect donations to be sent to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, which should be considered a base-building activity given the majority of Puerto Ricans in East Harlem. The development of a \u201cJustice Center\u201d strategy within the rest of the PSL would likely be a positive development . We would also like to see MLs engage in debates around strategy and tactics not just with other ML groups but also with other tendencies entirely.\n\nPerhaps so but one should not let such debates lead to place open to subversion however. \n\n&gt; For those who are currently unaffiliated with any organization, there are several options that we believe would be fruitful.\n\nOk, I'm listening. \n\n&gt; We are partial towards the Marxist Center milieu that prioritizes the base-building/dual-power strategy to build a new revolutionary socialist party. This informal, loose grouping of organizations (such as Philly Socialists, Communist Labor Party, Red Bloom Communist Collective, Austin Socialist Collective, and Kentucky Workers League) has its sights set on eventually building a countrywide socialist organization. Marxist Center groups focus on projects such as tenants unions, ESL classes, community gardens, community self-defense, and other base-building projects. The Marxist Center is perhaps the first new trend in U.S. Marxism since the 2008 financial collapse other than the Marxist-Leninist-Maoist revival.\n\nHmm, interesting, I'll look more into that tonight or tomorrow. \n\n&gt; Another movement that we believe everyone should be learning from is the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement (MXGM) and in particular Cooperation Jackson. These organizations are building a multi-pronged grassroots movement in Jackson, Mississippi. Their efforts include a solidarity economy (focused on co-ops and sustainability) as well as a successful mayoral campaign with Chokwe Lumumba and then his son Chokwe Antar. Cooperation Jackson is a vibrant organization with healthy internal struggle and base-building activities with the Jackson working class. Cooperation Jackson, like the Marxist Center, can be considered part of the modern base-building trend.\n\nIt can definitely. But the movement is not ML, right? Doesn't it also get some foundation money?\n\n&gt; We also think that Marxists can work productively in the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). While the DSA was founded on the principles of Zionism and Democratic Party lobbyism, and to this day maintains a conservative old guard, we believe that the recent influx in membership upon the election of Trump has destabilized the old leadership and given the organization a more \u201cmassy\u201d character, which may provide Marxists with the opportunity to expose new socialists to our ideas and methods of work.\n\nI'm not sure about that. You could say the same about the CPUSA, right? \n\n&gt; This work of organizing a revolutionary wing or tendency within DSA remains possible because the reformist wing, traditionally in power, has been overwhelmed by the massive influx of new members, most of whom are more receptive to radical ideas than the old guard. Additionally, the decentralized structure of DSA, in which local chapters have a high level of autonomy, makes it impossible for a reformist leadership at the national level at the national level to dictate the work of the entire organization. As long as the reformist tendency is not able to cohere, win hegemony over the majority of new members, and/or centralize organizational leadership so as to wholly direct the work of the organization, the formation of a revolutionary Marxist tendency within DSA remains not only possible, but urgently necessary.\n\nPerhaps but I'm not completely convinced this is a good idea.\n\n&gt; Base building, as it matures, will also come with developing new theory. We believe that rather than simply \u201capplying\u201d an ideology codified nearly a century ago, we will need to create new Marxist theory based on a \u201cconcrete analysis of our concrete situation\u201d in the United States in 2018.\n\nI don't think a new theory needs to be created but rather the existing one should be improved. We should build upon what already exists.\n\n&gt; While we do not know what this new theory will look like, it will have to account for the peculiar contours of the United States, in particular its legacy of slavery and genocide as well as its continued national oppression internally and imperialism externally.\n\nIt will and with that the question of reparations should be considered. \n\n&gt; Socialist revolution has never been made in a settler-colonial, imperialist bourgeois democracy like the United States. It would do us well to take seriously the lack of knowledge and experience we have to draw from, while not forgetting the lessons of history. We believe that in order to do this we must break from ML orthodoxy and not be afraid to be \u201cheretical\u201d in our approach. Dogmatism and hero worship can only impede this necessary process\n\nYes, we should do so while also gaining experience from the past.\n\n&gt; We believe that, in the U.S. in 2018, the truly important theoretical tasks have not been solved. We are in a period of a nascent socialist movement since the 2008 financial crisis. We should not be afraid of new ideas, and should look forward instead of harping on the 20th century. Without bending to reformism or adventurism, we must feel free to put everything back on the table and come to build strategy and theory through struggle.\n\nI agree. But we should also recognize what has worked and what hasn't worked in the past, building from there.","created_utc":1520046577,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Now those parties have been reduced to much smaller and more isolated formations while the critiques are some student with a blog. The problem is those critiques are not subject to critique because they don't build anything or change anything permanent. You can find all of these points in much more detail in \"post-Marxist\" literature, many of which was written by people with a lifetime of experience in the communist movement. It was wrong then but at least new, now it's just pathetic. How many times can we call for more openness, more discussion, more focus on hegemony and building coalitions before the reality of neoliberalism completely destroying the left by using these same strategies (we now know that in fact these wwre the neoliberal strategies of the left which were only later adapted by capital) before we can say that you've failed and the solution is more Marxism?\n\nThe ML movement is not repeating the mistakes of the past, such a thing is impossible as Marx makes clear in the 18th Brumaire. What appears to be repetition is really the collapse of the economic position of the first world petty-bourgeois. This provokes of course a general pro-imperialist socialism in youth and more coercive attempts to maintain hegemony over oppressed nations, and has the side effect of a smaller group rediscovering revolutionary Marxism. But the coordinates have changed, eurocommunism isn't possible anymore and neocolonialism requires new responses. These will take place within the Marxist-Leninist heritage because that is the heritage in which their previous accomplishments took place in and is the theoretical heritage of revolution. There is no alternative because nothing else has ever done anything. This response and your victimized bleating are even the contemporary repetition of the SDS to the PLP and then black panthers (even though you would be their enemy in that time they have been neutered and absorbed as the accomplishments of petty-bourgeois socialism generally) and the call for \"newness\" and being open to critique is a repetition, this time as farce.","created_utc":1520066009,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

With members of the LGBT community, it's very clear at this point that this is a natural occurance, but the leading philosophy during most of these country's lifespans was homophobic simply due to the lack of awareness on such phenomenon. This argument of \"the times were different\" is only passable if the party understands their mistake and makes efforts to correct itself. This isn't to say all leftists of the time subscribed to anti-lgbt sentiments; the black panther party is a good example of a group that used self crit to correct their misconceptions about homosexuality and misogyny.\n\nAs for the actual states of these countries, a lot of the propaganda against these countries are absolute ludicrous-- absolutely preposterous. The entire holodomor narrative, myths about mao, lies about the dprk, lies about *literally* every single socialist country.\n\nWhile you may disagree with some things in the ussr, the theory is very solid and has proven to be the most effective practice for implementing Marxism. The application of the theory does not have to follow the historical faults of the past (including homophobia), but certain things taken as faults to the west are actually seen as extremely beneficial to leftists (collectivization, for example). \n\nIf you haven't, *read* what Stalin wrote, and read what Lenin wrote, and read what mao wrote, read what the bpp wrote, and ho chi minh and how Libya's (although he wasnt a marxist)  government is described in The Green Book. \n\nThere is a heavy incentive for the rich to stay rich-- I mean, they're willing to tear countries apart, use slavery to make profit, destroy socialized civilization in favor of profit, so why wouldn't they be able to lie if they found it in their best interests, especially considering that they literally own western media. \n\nI too have had the worry that I sound like a holocaust denier, but upon researching about how the leftists saw fascism, it's clear how different they are (see \"The fascist offensive\" by George Dimitri for a good run down). I am of the belief, however, that the things around us are systemic. They are not systemic in the sense that \"Jews run everything so just kill all the Jews!\", it's systemic in the sense that someone is benefiting from others work and are making vast amounts of profits off of that, and will continuously make certain their social position remains static at the expense of others. Kwame Nkrumah's book, \"Neocolonialism, the last stage of imperialism\" does an amazing job of giving exact examples of companies that participated in the barbaric strategy of imperialism and neo imperialism, if specific examples would help you visualize a more concrete image.\n\n It seems clear to me that money, a universal equivalent that can buy and control, which can feed back into itself until a major crisis comes about, would be used to buy and control, and later position itself so that the same people who dominated capital circulation before will continue to do so. \n\nEdit: also, it's worth tracing where exactly the things people claim are propaganda are coming from. [This]https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/7awuc8/extremely_valuable_article_that_traces) is an amazing article on a lot of anti-soviet propaganda.\n\nIt's also worth noting: who has more to lose that they'd propagate so heavily, and if the dynamic was \"power\" or to attain political power to lord over people, why would communists consistently side with the downtrodden of society in order to achieve a powerful political position. Surely such self interest would be better rewarded under capitalism than communism. ","created_utc":1520110919,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Let me backtrack: organization for labor under the commodity-form is implicit.  This is not feudalism, or antiquary slavery.  Modern social positions are such that the vast majority can \"choose\" what to do with their labor capacity (or power if you're so inclined).  That of course doesn't mean it's a real choice (eat or starve).  But it means that organization to achieve an end for labor is implied within the specific character of labor as a commodity.  Having said that, the solution must also be consonant with both the character of capital and the form under which labor could ever move against this dynamic.  For example, white nationalists can organize.  Democrats and Republicans can obviously organize.  But to what ends?  Ok -- \"political\" ends.  But what do politics express but our material, economic disassociation?  \n\nThe problem with vanguardism is that vanguardism was not a requirement to unleash the potential within modern productive forces.  That has occurred despite a vanguard.  The 'blind' dynamic is already the revolutionary vanguard, which makes labor unnecessary.  This does NOT mean we could not do this ourselves, and in a manner which, as you say, addresses the problem of people on the one hand 'needing' labor and money, and on the other addressing things like inflation, or the attack on purchasing power.  If you want to call the group or body that speaks to the working class about reduction of hours of labor a 'vanguard' --- fine --- but a vanguard was never necessary to procure the conditions for emancipation.

I'm not trying to make a serious point here just to make that clear :P but when I think about it it makes sense.

{"author":"closovsky","body":"Human nature is always in a context, in a situation, meaning in a social world. Human naturally collaborate or compete accordingly. Our society relies on the competition among the many to try rise above average in order to gain relative privileges. The few rely on it to control the many. Man, as much as woman, are measured, compared, tested, valued and eventually classified. This is mainly so for lower classes, since those of middle-high classes have by property, knowledge and contacts a definite competitive advantage, which helps them reproduce their condition. As Peter Thiel puts it 'competition is for loosers'. And he's right. \n\nWhen people talk to you about human nature, you simply reply with human history. It's easy to gain competitive advantage towards 'success' if your parents sends you to Eaton or whatever prep-school. Another is if you grew up in the slum of London, when at 10 the peeps you want to be part of tell you that you have to go down the street and knock down flat the first idiot that passes by; fail to do so and they will beat the shit out of you. No matter the result, you're fucked. Your social background are the bases of what you'll become. Exceptions are indeed exceptions.  \n\nHume or Descartes once commented on concentration, thing that might be used to understand the power of the will also. He would make the example of reading. If you read a book you can easily cancel out all the noises in the room or even in the street and concentrate fully on what you read. But try to read putting a hand on a burning candle. No matter the degree of concentration, you'll never make it. Same with existence, if you're born within violence there is no way you can rise above it, no will power will ever be enough against ignorance, corruption and threat. There is no human nature only human history. What I just typed did not come from some genes, or instinct, I had to learn it. And that's that.

{"author":"doc_sutt","body":"First: I assume you are in high school (IDK what history 12 is) and I really liked your paper.  Great research and facts, and a conversational essay. \nHowever, and I say this to help, you failed to actually argue your point.  Since you posted here, I assume you support collectivization; but I honestly did not get that from reading your paper until the very end.  By those last few sentences most people stopped reading/tuned out/don't care.  What I mean is the first paragraph reads like an angry knee-jerk response to a poorly worded question, followed by a bunch of facts without telling the reader WHY collectivism worked. Take the great research you did and MAKE AN ARGUMENT (collectivization worked).  Use the facts to back your argument up and lose the Ayn Rand/Reagan bs (clearly your audience [the teacher] has a biased viewpoint, by ridiculing that viewpoint before your argument he/she will just tune you out) at the beginning and you can answer the question convincingly in about 15 sentences. \n For example start with: Collectivism was a successful policy because it quickly achieved the goals set in place by the Party and brought the SU out of the tyranny of feudalism.   These goals were (1+2).  Goal 1: 1-2 facts, then argue the success; repeat with goal 2.  THEN acknowledge the struggles (instead of randomly acknowledging them and undercutting yourself), and explain that they were worth the success.  Finally quick conclusion. \n  I tell you all this as an ardent capitalist who likes open discourse, and I want you to be able to argue your position well.  You have the facts, but you need to argue their meaning if you want to convince anyone.  Do not let me (someone opposed to your position) just dismiss your work as not making a point or quit reading at the first Reagan mention.  \"Collectivism worked because\"... will keep me reading, and your fact based arguments will force me (or your teacher!) to respond on the merits.\n\nSorry for the long post, I hope that was helpful and I did like your work.  I truly am interested in pro-communist (socialist if being technical) ideas, if for no other reason than to understand the opposite view point and hopefully compromise on most issues.

An estimated 2.1 million, out of a population of 60.3 million, died from starvation, malaria and other diseases aggravated by malnutrition, population displacement, unsanitary conditions, and lack of health care. Millions were impoverished as the crisis overwhelmed large segments of the economy and social fabric.\n\nBengal's economy was predominantly agrarian. For at least a decade before the crisis, between half and three quarters of those dependent on agriculture were already at near-subsistence levels.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/communism/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1520285829,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"This is actually the example Sraffa uses to show the incoherence of bourgeois economic theory. It's called \"double reswitching\" and refers to the basic problem that if each unit of labor and each unit of capital has a marginal utility which decreases until they meet at at the ideal balance of capital/labor, reaching a certain point in which it is more profitable to go back to labor over capital is theoretically impossible (the marginal utility would have to increase again from the ideal). Not really important since Sraffa himself mystifies economics and the particular contradictions of neoclassical economics are about as important as the particular contradictions of the bible. \n\nAnyway, this was quite common in the age of colonialism when indigenous labor was so cheap and disposable that it was often easier to merely incorporate pre-capitalist forms of labor into direct accumulation than either develop the industry of the colonies or use more advanced but more expensive labor in the homeland. Slavery is a similar example, which not only persisted far beyond its lifespan as a productive system but was incorporated into the advanced capitalism of Europe which had an interest in under-developing the southern US (preventing the \"humanitarian intervention\" of Britain in the US Civil War was one of the first great victories of the communist movement under Marx and Engels). Slavery is unusual because the advanced machinery of the Cotton Gin kept alive a backwards mode of production which shows that history is not a smooth line but zig zags through the long historical trends Marx uncovered with multiple modes of production coexisting, the relation that determines which is primary being very complex.","created_utc":1520310085,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

It's about resisting the attempted recolonisation of Syria by the US, France(!), and the US's gulf client states.\n\nThe 'revolution' in Syria is nothing but an alternative to US invasion. Being against the invasion of Iraq didn't make you a \"Saddamist\". Being against NATO and the US doing exactly what they are doing to Syria now, to Libya, in 2011, didn't make you a \"Gaddafist\". It's not a coincidence that the global south's national-bourgeois states all side with the Syrian government.\n\nCommunists have no side with the 'revolution' in Syria. As you cannot support the overthrow of a state in the abstract, what concrete, specific force within Syria can supporters of the 'revolution' point to that is near capable of and willing to overthrow the government and replace them when a power vacuum inevitably results?\n\nTo be more direct with my question: who among the opposition do they support? Ahrar Al Sham? Jabhat Al Nusra? Jabhat Al Islamiyah? Jabhat Al Shamiyah? The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria?\n\nIf none of these, who? Because these are the only forces within Syria that meet the aforementioned criteria and I would be very interested in hearing how they are a progressive alternative compared to the government. And if any of these forces take power, all of the Syrian non-Sunnis and non-Arabs, who btw make up at least 40% of Syria's people, are totally doomed. I won't accept abstracts, such as 'the people' as that is a useless response; or 'but I support The Kurds', as that is irrelevant to, you know, THE REST OF SYRIA (lol).\n\nYes, Assad and his party have colluded with the US in the past. So did, at different stages, Saddam with the US and Gaddafi with the UK. The US's orientation to a state can change. What's hard to understand about that?

In this case someone has to manage the property which is publicly owned, regardless of whether those people are the government or another entity, and whoever manages those property or resources has an inordinate amount of power over the country whether or not they abuse this power. Moreover with the African examples I listed while yes, these situations did not occur under communism, they occurred because of a governmental control and abuse of resources and I do not see how a communal industry would have prevented resources from being siphoned as you suggest, as in either situations the system could be easily gamed for personal gain by whoever handles or has control over the resources.","created_utc":1520378630,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

In that case, those ethnic and other groups who might be concentrated in lower-income or less prestigious occupations, guided by their socialistic mentors, will predictably raise the cry that free-market capitalism is evil and \"discriminatory\" and that therefore collectivism is needed to redress the balance. In that case, the intelligence argument will become useful to defend the market economy and the free society from ignorant or self-serving attacks. In short; racialist science is properly not an act of aggression or a cover for oppression of one group over another, but, on the contrary, an operation in defense of private property against assaults by aggressors.\n\nAnd who can forget this pearl from John Stuart Mill's *On Liberty*:\n\n&gt; It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this doctrine [of individual liberty] is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties. We are not speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood. Those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others, must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury. For the same reason, we may leave out of consideration those backward states of society in which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage. The early difficulties in the way of spontaneous progress are so great, that there is seldom any choice of means for overcoming them; and a ruler full of the spirit of improvement is warranted in the use of any expedients that will attain an end, perhaps otherwise unattainable. Despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting that end. Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of things anterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being improved by free and equal discussion. Until then, there is nothing for them but implicit obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one. But as soon as mankind have attained the capacity of being guided to their own improvement by conviction or persuasion (a period long since reached in all nations with whom we need here concern ourselves), compulsion, either in the direct form or in that of pains and penalties for non-compliance, is no longer admissible as a means to their own good, and justifiable only for the security of others.","created_utc":1520392404,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

Also, there was public dissatisfaction because the consumer economy and standard of living was decent, but not nearly as high as the West. This was because the Soviet Union was forced to spend so much on its military and invest heavily in engineering, research and development in creating new military armaments preparing for another invasion from the West as had happened twice in the earlier part of the twentieth century.

Then Gorbachev instituted perestroika and whatever totally fixable problems there were got exacerbated. The relatively minor problems with the economy  were totally solvable. Instead of putting out the fire, Gorbachev threw gasoline on it. The main point is, that the Soviet Union and socialism did not fail on its own or because it's system was unworkable or unsustainable.

{"author":"The_Casualty","body":"White Supremacists Love Nietzsche, But Nietzsche Would Hate White Supremacists\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche is without a doubt one of the most misunderstood and misinterpreted philosophers ever, and now white supremacists and neo-Nazis are using his philosophy (wrongly) for their malicious means.\n\nInfamous white supremacist and alt-righter Richard Spencer talked to the Atlantic back in June, in which he said, \u201cYou could say I was red-pilled by Nietzsche.\u201d The term \u201cRed-pilled\u201d is common among alt-righters, which basically means that moment of clarity in which one finally sees the reality and truth after being blinded for so long.\n\nLike the Nazis before, white supremacists like Spencer have hijacked Nietzsche\u2019s philosophy, and turned it into the absolute opposite of what Nietzsche intended. Nietzsche did consider the world to be in constant change, in which there is no absolute truth, add to that his hatred of conventional morality and social restrictions, in which he saw them as crippling the individual and his prosperity.\n\nNietzsche was also a strong critic of Christianity and its values, he calls it a \u2018slave morality\u2019 developed by the weak to sway the powerful.\n\nBut there\u2019s a lot more to Nietzsche, every person who dedicated his time to study his philosophy would realize this fact. Most people just read Nietzsche quotes on the internet or maybe one or two books without even giving some thought to what the philosopher is saying. And because of that, a lot of people misinterpret Nietzsche and completely transform his philosophy, and in some radical cases, we get people like Spencer.\n\nIt is not hard to see why white supremacists would admire Nietzsche, he has an earth-shattering and rebellious philosophy, in which asks people to consider everything they have been taught and reevaluate their entire moral system. These people want to be rebellious, they think individuals in today\u2019s society are completely brainwashed, and are entirely blind to the facts. They find in Nietzsche a rebel, an outcast, and someone who despises political correctness. All that is true, but what usually happens is that some people start reading Nietzsche in search of what they already believe in, in the case of white supremacists they want to find white pride, nationalism, and anti-Semitism.\n\nNietzsche is a lot of things, but to anyone who truly understands him and his philosophy, he isn\u2019t an anti-Semitic white nationalist, on the contrary, he is the exact opposite.\n\nBut misinterpretation isn\u2019t the only reason white nationalists would appreciate Nietzsche, neo-Nazis today see in Nietzsche the philosopher of Nazi Germany, the philosopher that brought Hitler. But that has Nietzsche\u2019s sister, which was a staunch anti-Semite, to blame for. Nietzsche\u2019s sister was in charge of his estate after he died, and she and her husband, both Nazi sympathizers, rearranged Nietzsche\u2019s notes and essays to produce the infamous, The Will to Power, the book that embraced Nazi ideology. This book made Nietzsche\u2019s sister and her husband closer to Hitler.\n\nBut now, who was the real Nietzsche? In short he was a philosopher who despised nationalism, white pride, and anti-Semitism.\n\nIn his book Ecce Homo Nietzsche declares:\n\n    \u201cThis most anti-cultural sickness and unreason there is, nationalism, this nervose nationale with which Europe is sick, this perpetuation of European particularism, of petty politics\u2026a dead-end street.\u201d\n\nNietzsche also denounced \u201cthe blood and soil\u201d politics of Otto von Bismarck,the famous Prussian conservative statesman who unified Germany in 1871, for having a nationalistic approach and calling for racial purity.\n\nNietzsche despised anti-Semitism, in which later on made him end his friendship with the proto-fascist composer and staunch anti-Semite Richard Wagner.\n\nIn his famous book, Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche proposes we:\n\n    \u201cExpel the anti-Semitic squallers out of the country.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to his sister calling out her anti-Semitism he wrote:\n\n    \u201cYour association with an anti-Semitic chief expresses a foreignness to my whole way of life which fills me ever again with ire or melancholy.\u201d\n\nAnd in another draft letter written in the end of December 1887, his sister and her husband Nieztsche wrote:\n\n    I\u2019ve seen proof, black on white, that Herr Dr. F\u00f6rster has not yet severed his connection with the anti-Semitic movement\u2026Since then I\u2019ve had difficulty coming up with any of the tenderness and protectiveness I\u2019ve so long felt toward you. The separation between us is thereby decided in really the most absurd way. Have you grasped nothing of the reason why I am in the world?\u2026Now it has gone so far that I have to defend myself hand and foot against people who confuse me with these anti-Semitic canaille; after my own sister, my former sister, and after Widemann more recently have given the impetus to this most dire of all confusions. After I read the name Zarathustra in the anti-Semitic Correspondence my forbearance came to an end. I am now in a position of emergency defense against your spouse\u2019s Party. These accursed anti-Semite deformities shall not sully my ideal!!\n\nGeorges Bataille was one of the first to denounce the deliberate misinterpretation of Nietzsche carried out by Nazis, among them Alfred Baeumler. He dedicated in January 1937 an issue of Ac\u00e9phale, titled \u201cReparations to Nietzsche,\u201d to the theme \u201cNietzsche and the Fascists\u201d. There, he called Elisabeth F\u00f6rster-Nietzsche \u201cElisabeth Judas-F\u00f6rster,\u201d recalling Nietzsche\u2019s declaration:\n\n    \u201cTo never frequent anyone who is involved in this bare-faced fraud concerning races.\u201d\n\nWhite supremacists and neo-Nazis rejoice for finding terms like \u2018Aryan humanity\u2019, but little do they know the true meaning of this phrase. Nietzsche uses this phrase in several books, but Aryan here simply is a contrasted term opposing Christian morality, it means pre-Christian Pagan values. BesidesAryan wasn\u2019t in Nietzsche\u2019s time a term used to describe racial purity, in that time it also included Indo-Iranian peoples.\n\nNietzsche is one of the greatest philosophers to ever live, he certainly has his flaws, but he certainly isn\u2019t a philosopher of white supremacy. Nietzsche was disgusted by anti-Semitism, he condemned blind nationalism, and criticized the absurdity of racial purity. But white supremacists\u2019 love to Nietzsche shows one thing, their intellectual weakness, the fragility of the ground they stand on, and their brainwashing, ironically the brainwashing of the people who proclaim, they were \u2018red-pilled\u2019.","created_utc":1520483385,"score":60,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"Nietzsche was a reactionary but it's important to understand why he is a reactionary. That is because while few read him, he has been massively influential on the first world left (which has a poisonous effect on intellectual production in the third world). Without Marxism-Leninism as the guide for communism as progressive and rational (an easy position for anyone with criticisms of actually-existing socialism) the alternative is a critique of the Enlightenment and the tradition of reason in general as totalitarian, racist, sexist, alienating, etc. Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, Adorno, Butler, Spivak, etc are all direct descendants of this school of thought which was originally a radically right-wing mysticism and has become a kind of cobbled together identity based leftism. If you don't know who those people are that's fine because clearly it wasn't theory but material conditions that made certain theory engulf the left. But the theory is still important because it is so ubiquitous. Politically that's true (despite a decade of financial crisis and the beginnings of a left-liberal socialism entering mainstream politics, actual leftist politics remain overwhelmingly identity based and radically atomistic and anarchistic) but even theoretically: how many socialists actually commit to Marxism as a science which has reached a more advanced stage of human civilization (even many good Marxists have tried to \"purge\" Hegel and the concept of progress. I think the early Althusser was harmless since Spinozist Marxism ends up in the same place but later he became \"post-Marxist\" and looked to the nazi philosophy of Heidegger)? Such a concept was taken for granted by Lenin and Stalin and Mao but has become unspeakable outside of a few places, none of which are scholarly.\n\nE: I'm not saying you should do that, praxis is a much better use of your time.

Rejecting the Enlightenment seems like a pretty reasonable communist position to me and dismissing Adorno, Butler, and Spivak as thinly cloaked right wing mystics seems strange.\n\n&gt;Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers on the chain *not in order that man shall continue to bear that chain without fantasy or consolation*, but so that he shall throw off the chain and pluck the living flower. The criticism of religion disillusions man, so that he will think, act, and fashion his reality like a man who has discarded his illusions and regained his senses, so that he will move around himself as his own true Sun. Religion is only the illusory Sun which revolves around man as long as he does not revolve around himself.\n\n&gt;It is, therefore, the task of history, once the other-world of truth has vanished, *to establish the truth of this world*. It is the immediate task of philosophy, which is in the service of history, to unmask self-estrangement in its unholy forms once the holy form of human self-estrangement has been unmasked. Thus, the criticism of Heaven turns into the criticism of Earth, the criticism of religion into the criticism of law, and the criticism of theology into the criticism of politics.\n\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm\n\nMy emphasis. Marxism is a tradition of reason in the specific tradition of the French Revolution (which is why both the Bolshevik and Chinese revolutions saw themselves specifically as continuing the French Revolution - Robespierre as a Bolshevik before his time - and the Paris Commune - The Shanghai Commune as the realization of the universality of reason and humankind). This is still common in  socialist Anti-enlightenment philosophy which must reject the progressive nature of the bourgeois revolutions and thus the claim to complete them by communism. \n\n&gt;Which definition of science are we using? Referring to Marxism as \"science\" is slippery because what science meant in Marx or Lenin's day just isn't what science means today.\n\nIt is actually, Marxism is as scientifically valid today as it was when Marx wrote Capital. It appears you are the exact kind of leftist I am talking about which is why uncovering the mysticism which has let these fascist philosophies creep into our theory, to the point where one isn't even aware (which is bizarre as the theorists I mentioned openly return to Nietzsche and Heidegger, it's not a secret, the only difficulty is constructing this return as a coherent philosophy out of the fragments of postmodernism and poststructuralism) is so essential.

Through building strong mass links\u2014in particular among the working class and oppressed nationalities in this country\u2014we can advance the struggle against patriarchy as part of the larger struggle for revolution and communism.

{"author":"nice_try_western_spy","body":"stalin and the party previously thought that the right opposition had been destroyed during the purges, but Khrushchev was still able to slither his way out without a scratch. Khrushchev basically regurgitated a bunch of trotskyist lies stated a decade prior. the reception to the speech was shock, a lot of soviet citizens were outraged, and other socialist countries were angry as well. mao stated in 1963 (i could be wrong about the date): \u201cKhrushchev has abused Stalin as a \u201cmurderer\u201d, a \u201ccriminal\u201d a \u201cbandit\u201d, a \u201cgambler\u201d, a \u201cdespot of the type of Ivan the Terrible\u201d, \u201cthe greatest dictator in Russian history\u201d, a \u201cfool\u201d, an \u201cidiot\u201d, etc. When we are compelled to cite all this filthy, vulgar and malicious language, we are afraid it may soil our pen and paper\". anyone who basically tried to defend stalin was then just accused of being part of the personality cult. the west on the other hand was over joyed, they just had a soviet leader betray pretty much all soviet morals and Khrushchev's speech is used as capitalist propaganda to this day. Grover Furr, spent years going to the soviet archive and researching the claims made by the speech, after all of his work he concluded that only one of krushchev's many claims could be probable, the rest were outright lies. he wrote a book titled Khrushchev Lied, if you are interested in reading it. after krushchev took power the ussr slowly started to decline, the number of workers in the party loyal to stalin and socialism were removed, this lead to a pretty stagnant bureaucracy  within the party. krushchev also began this crazy campaign with corn that ended in disaster. krushchev also allowed foreign policy to get out of hand, like lying to the US which caused the cuban missile crisis. so yeah, the secret speech is not reliable one bit.

{"author":"carryingbricks","body":"&gt;I'm disinclined to pursue this, because it has no effect on the actual production where the animal abuse happens it just ends up being sold to somebody else\n\nThis rather begs the question against the consequentialist vegan position. Here's a common consequentialist argument against that point:\n\n \n\n\n\n&gt;Assume that I normally eat twenty chickens per year, and let\u2019s try out different assumptions about how sensitive the meat industry is to changes in demand. Suppose, first, that they are maximally sensitive, or sensitive to differences of one: for every chicken consumed this year, there will be one additional chicken grown next year. If so, then my decision not to eat chicken is fully rational: it is guaranteed to reduce the suffering of twenty chickens at very little cost. Or rather, for economic reasons, other people might eat more chicken if I eat less,91 so let\u2019s say instead that I would reduce the suffering of ten chickens at very little cost. Next, suppose that the meat industry is sensitive only to differences of 10,000: it will increase next year\u2019s supply only when the number of chickens consumed this year reaches a multiple of 10,000. So, for example, when the millionth chicken is sold this year, this will ensure greater production next year, because 1,000,000 is a multiple of 10,000. However, the sale of additional chickens won\u2019t affect production until one million and ten thousand chickens are sold. Now the question is whether my chicken boycott will determine whether some multiple of 10,000 is reached. If so, then the odds of my boycott mattering are merely 10 in 10,000, or 1 in 1,000. However, when a multiple of 10,000 is reached, the industry will increase production by 10,000. So, I now have a 1 in 1,000 chance of eliminating the suffering of 10,000 chickens, rather than a 1 in 1 chance of eliminating the suffering of 10 chickens. Each action has the same expected utility; both are fully rational. Finally, assume that the industry is sensitive only to multiples of 100,000. Now the odds of my boycott mattering dip down to 10 in 100,000, or 1 in 10,000. However, the payoff would be a world in which 100,000 fewer chickens suffer. Again, my action would be fully rational.92\r\n\n&gt;This analysis is oversimplified. For example, it ignores the possible effects of government subsidies. But the basic idea is compelling: if the odds of success are high, then the payoff is high enough to justify boycotting meat; and if the odds of success are low, then the payoff is proportionally greater, and again the boycott is morally correct. Furthermore, as Alastair Norcross says, \u201cmany people who become vegetarians influence others to become vegetarian, who in turn influence others, and so on. It appears, then, that the claim of causal impotence is mere wishful thinking\n\nNot to mention, my abstaining from murdering humans will have no bearing on the actual murder rate, but that fact doesn't mean my policy against murdering others is poorly motivated or doesn't matter ethically. If one has good reason to do or not to do something, it shouldn't matter what others do.\n\n\n&gt;as well as malnutrition being much more common with diets that do not include animal products.\r\n\nThe foremost experts claim vegan diets can be healthy. Anyway, I argue that one should be vegan if one has healthy and relatively affordable plant based alternatives readily available -- ought implies can.","created_utc":1520632502,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

When vegans go proselytizing, I categorize their arguments into 2 types, and this is an ontology vegans explained to me by the way. First, there are the honest arguments. These are the arguments the vegans themselves believe in. Then there are the opportunistic things they say to people in an effort to manipulate them into eating less meat, and includes arguments for vegetarianism (such as the environmental/health impacts of eating meat).\n\nArguments of the latter category are a dime a dozen and they\u2019re all dishonest. You can make an environmentalist/human health case for broad based vegetarianism, but the only honest case for veganism is 100% purely moral. There is just no honest and straightforward way to go from \u201dcapitalist factory farming is bad for the environment\u201d to \u201cregardless of the circumstances it is always immoral to eat honey.\u201d The former could possibly be part of a rational argument about how to engage with the vicious realities of capitalist modernity. The latter could not, the latter is a conclusion rooted in deontological, (btw therefore thoroughly unmarxist) ethics. Every effort to convince someone to become a vegan because of capitalist agriculture\u2019s excesses is dishonest or worse implicitly or explicitly liberal.\n\nAaaand the long and short of it is that there are no uncontroversial questions in ethics, and vegans haven\u2019t convinced me that it\u2019s inherently more unethical to eat honey than mushrooms _simply_ because one was made by a member of kingdom Animalia, and one was not. It rests on too many assumptions about the natures of different kinds of life and their respective capacities for experiencing pain.\n\nMany vegans are also indigenists or primitivists, which is ironic because so many indigenous peoples have always held that plants have as much spiritual life as animals, and therefore don\u2019t bother with \nVeganism. \n\nThere is also the fact that so many vegans take such a high and mighty stand about animal rights but when it comes to migrant farm workers struggling and dying on the farms that grow their produce?

Marx's schemes of reproduction make it clear that consumer driven politics is doomed to fail by the foundation of capitalism as a system that reproduces itself. Whether people (or even movements) are anti-capitalist or not is irrelevant to whether they were effective against capitalism, something solely determined by scientific analysis and its implementation.\n\nBDS works (in theory) because capitalism is already inclined in its neoliberal mode to abandon settler colonialism and overt racism. I think capitalism in the abstract is neutral on what the proletariat eats and it's imaginable for a vegetarian capitalism to exist. But BDS is not very successful and the amount of realignment within capitalism to eliminate meat production is far greater. And unlike in South Africa and Palestine there is no serious radical movement to which the moderate solution of getting rid of apartheid while keeping neoliberalism can be juxtaposed.\n\nI do not have a solution for you because I think practically socialism is a precondition for any environmental movement and such movements don't need an independent existence. But the lack of serious thinking and its replacement with hysteria and fantasizing about moral righteousness on display in these movements and in this thread makes me think the movement, if it even exists, is of no value to the proletariat. Any solution would start with serious analysis of the balance of forces and how to change them. Even the most radical movements refuse to kill humans because it is immoral (a lack of scientific seriousness) which is the masquerade for the real reason: it would alienate people from what are already isolated terroristic tactics.

{"author":"[deleted]","body":"In my personal experience, Third Worldists aren't usually white guys and the primary difference stems from a concern about Eurocentrism. \n\nIf you are really interested, I would read the conclusion of [this book](https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/euro.pdf), but in short:\n\nThere is a concern about mechanical materialism in European communist thought. Particularly, the concept that there is a progression of one mode of production to the next to the next, can sometimes have disturbing genocidal implications applied to contexts of colonialism (if a more advanced society replaces another, it is better overall. i.e. \"be happy you were colonized\". it's not really saying that but you get the gist).\n\nAnother strong point is that they believe that imperialist core countries are more dependent on super-profits from the third world than they are to domestic exploitation. Therefore, the fastest way to weaken the ruling class in America is to help revolutions in countries we super-exploit.\n\n&gt;The existence of a world capitalist system characterized by center and periphery determines the circumstances in which the revolution develops in various places. The advanced capitalist countries are' autocentric' in the sense that the logic of their social and economic development is decisive in determining what happens in the exploited nations; this conception of auto-centricity does not deny, but on the contrary accentuates their dependence upon super profits extorted from the oppressed nations, hence the vulnerability of central capitalism to the revolutionary storms in the periphery. \n\n-Eurocentrism and the Communist Movement, pg 85\n\n\nI'm not a Third Worldist myself but that book has some very good points. And those guys have their heart in the right place so they are the last people I'd get bent out of shape over. Ultimately though, I think a lot of it boils down to wanting to 'cleanse yourself' of America and avoiding a sense of personal responsibility for exploitation by living in America or wherever else. Fundamentally, what they are doing is an expression of bourg individualism, even if they end up doing some really great things. ","created_utc":1520666737,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

Our concrete organization in North America is at a historically low ebb. We should put in work to build up our organizations so we can start rebuilding movements and start collectively producing answers to the questions. It's one thing to say that PCR-RCP and Red Guards collectives have bad lines on this and that, but then to jump from that to rejecting Marxism as a whole, because these organizations didn't produce a perfect line before the conditions for producing even a generally correct line were in place, according to themselves...? \n\nIf Ena\u035eemaehkiw had ever clearly understood Marxist philosophy and the Marxist theory of knowledge he would realize that dismissing Marxism as a whole in this fashion is intellectually dishonest and unfair. So perhaps he never understood Marxism as well as he thought he did, or he is just drifting into bobble-headed academic \"leftism\" where every shade of intellectual dishonesty is permitted against Marxism.\n\nI broadly agree that in settler-colonial countries the social structure and therefore social revolutions are probably going to look quite different than say how a revolution might play out in China or Western Europe, it's just odd that Ena\u035eemaehkiw  is now anti-Marxist because of a bunch of things he ought to have known better than.","created_utc":1520674820,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"TheSutphin","body":"What would Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels write today? Perhaps something like this:\n\n\u201cA spectre is haunting the world \u2014 the spectre of activism. All the powers of the old world order have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009It is high time that Activists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views.\u201d\n\nThese sentences faithfully echo the opening words of\u00a0The Communist Manifesto. The original famously declared: \u201cThe history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.\u201d For Marx and Engels, in a capitalist system a sequence of widening splits between the classes was inevitable. The bourgeoisie would become more powerful as markets expanded, until the disenfranch\u00adised labourers in the proletarian class booted them out. Ultimately a revolution would end capitalism\u2019s reign.\n\nAs a partner in a corporate advisory firm and a professor of law and finance, we are true believers in free-market capitalism \u2014 hardly natural latter-day communists, let alone successors to Marx and Engels. But we do believe the time is ripe for a rewrite of their\u00a0Manifesto. Like the inhabitants of mid-19th century Europe, we live, according to Oxford University\u2019s Professor Alan Morrison, \u201cin the wake of a calamitous financial crisis and in the midst of whirlwind social change, a popular distaste of financial capitalists, and widespread revolutionary activity\u201d.\n\nWe have imagined what Marx and Engels would have written in 2018, naming the new, updated version \u201cThe Activist Manifesto\u201d. After all, as Morrison writes in the introduction to our work, \u201cwe could use a coherent explanation of the forces that buffet us, and a hint as to their likely resolution\u201d.\n\nThe original had a long gestation. Marx first met his friend and collaborator briefly in 1842, and then again in a caf\u00e9 in Paris in 1844. Marx, a journalist for a radical leftist newspaper, had just read Engels\u2019\u00a0The Condition of the Working Class in England\u00a0in 1844, and was taken with his argument that the working class could become agents of radical change. The two became friends and began writing together, critiquing various philosophies circulating at the time. The first edition of\u00a0The Manifesto of the Communist Party, a 23-page pamphlet, was published in February 1848. For more than two decades it languished in obscurity, but in the early 1870s it resurfaced and, from that point on, Marx and Engels updated it repeatedly, in various editions and languages.\n\nIn our redrafting, we have had to go far beyond merely substituting \u201ccommunism\u201d with \u201cactivism\u201d. The \u201cPope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies\u201d and others in Marx\u2019s and Engels\u2019 sights have gone. We have introduced their modern counterparts: \u201cthe corporate Haves, the elites, the billionaires, the establishment politicians of the Republican and Democratic parties, Conservatives and Labour, the talking heads at Davos, the echo chambers of online media and fake news.\u201d But we have kept much of the rhetoric along with Marx\u2019s and Engels\u2019 relentless focus on economic inequality. Two centuries after Marx\u2019s birth, and however much communism has rightly been discredited, a great deal of the argument is as relevant now as it was then.\n\nThe\u00a0Manifesto\u2019s theories about the problems of capitalism and the capitalist mode of production continue to be cited in critiques of unfettered markets, and the document\u2019s historical analysis is cited by modern scholars and taught in universities today. Some historians have cited it as the most influential text of the 19th century. Its reverberations are still felt today.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nSo how did the\u00a0two of us come to take on the renovation of the\u00a0Manifesto? The answer, improbably perhaps, is our interest in a linchpin of modern free-market capitalism: shareholder activism. We have published academic studies on the phenomenon. We have advised many of the largest hedge funds as they take substantial stakes in hundreds of comp\u00adanies, shaking up complacent boards and advocating for changes in corporate strategy and capital structure. And we have advised companies that themselves have pursued change. These activists may not be what Marx and Engels had in mind, but they are revolutionaries of a kind.\n\n\ufffcWe have also imagined what might happen if shareholder activists joined forces with political, social and corporate activists as a united front. As in Marx\u2019s and Engels\u2019 time, economic in\u00adequality is rising, wages are stagnating, and the owners of productive capital are reaping the benefits of technological advances. Yet likewise, today as then, the separate grassroots movements of various factions in various countries have not yet united under a single umbrella.\n\nThen last year we posed the question: what would Marx and Engels say about the financial, political and social movements of today? We downloaded a copy of the original\u00a0Manifesto, copied its text into a shared document and began reading aloud, changing words as we went. What we heard, in our newly reimagined context, spoke to us as if Marx and Engels had anticipated the movements of the 21st century.\n\nSome notions were no longer relevant, of course, or had been proved appallingly wrong, underpinning murderous tyrannies across the world. We don\u2019t advocate the confiscation of private property or the abolition of inheritance, and we think the notion of \u201cequal liability of all to labour\u201d has been unworkable, even for communist governments. But still, the document had bones. We edited and supplemented the famous first section so that it became the version above. And then we continued, word by word, keeping the text where it sang, but repairing and reconstructing, just as you would renovate an old house.\n\nWe cut many of their specific proposals. The 193 mentions of \u201cbourgeois\u201d and 93 of \u201cproletariat\u201d \u2014 all had to go. We substituted \u201cHave-Not\u201d in place of \u201cproletariat\u201d, which refers to workers and wage-earners, because we want to address more broadly the poor, the unemployed and those lacking a voice in how society operates. We substituted \u201cHave\u201d in place of \u201cbourgeois\u201d, which some commentators and politicians continue to use unironically but which we see as too ambiguous for 2018. We also revised the original\u2019s treatment of gender roles and the plight of \u201cmen\u201d, updating the last sentence \u2014 \u201cWorking Men of All Countries, Unite!\u201d \u2014 to reflect modern sensibilities. But the vast majority of their language \u2014 74 per cent of the original words \u2014 remained intact.\n\nWe felt justified in our renovation, based on Marx\u2019s and Engels\u2019 own reflections from 1872 \u2014 some 25 years after they first began their discussions, after the First Congress of the Communist League. They wrote: \u201cThe practical application of the prin\u00adciples will depend, as the Manifesto itself states, everywhere and at all times, on the historical conditions for the time being existing, and, for that reason, no special stress is laid on the revolutionary measures\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u201d\n\nThe original Manifesto\u2019s top 10 \u2018generally applicable\u2019 proposals wouldn\u2019t get a passing grade today\n\nWe agree. The original\u00a0Manifesto\u2019s top 10 \u201cpretty generally applicable\u201d proposals wouldn\u2019t get a passing grade today in any setting. Left and right alike reject its arguments on labour and property. Even leaders of so-called communist states embrace markets and decentralisation. Take North Korea, the country that has most resisted capitalism: since 2012, it has started to encourage entrepreneurship and a formal (if reluctant) acceptance of brand-led marketplaces.\n\nHowever, one aspect of the original still resonates: the document was, fundamentally, an attack on inequality. We think it is obvious that Marx and Engels would be appalled by the present-day distribution of wealth. We imagine they would write something like this.\n\n\u201cBy the start of our 21st century, we are faced with the extraordinary fact that the top one per cent of the world\u2019s population own the same resources as the remaining 99 per cent. Those at the bottom are less upwardly mobile than in previous generations; entrance to wealthy gated communities is blocked, not only by private security forces, but also by the increasingly prohibitive costs of healthcare, technology and education. There is the dominant force of mass incarceration, with millions of poor, minorities and powerless walled off from the rulers they might threaten. The Haves have never in history held so much advantage over the Have-Nots.\u201d\n\nIf Marx and Engels had been active readers of this newspaper, we think they would have been critics of financial innovation and would have seized on the financial crisis in particular, perhaps writing something along the lines of:\n\n\ufffc\u201cAs with the manias, panics, and crashes of history, the dislocations arising from the financial crisis created new opportunities for the Haves to benefit from seizing the political response. The use and abuse of complex financial innovation \u2014 derivatives, structured products, credit default swaps and collateralised debt obligations \u2014 have extended the financial system beyond its primary purpose of facilitating economic growth and matching borrowers and savers to secondary and more dubious purposes.\u201d\n\nThe four-part structure of the original\u00a0Manifesto\u00a0also continues to work, so we have preserved it.\n\nFirst is \u201cHaves and Have-Nots\u201d (formerly \u201cbourgeois and proletarians\u201d). Here, the original language and arguments focused on the history of class struggle and the technological developments that led to the widening gap between workers and the owners of capital. We have added some perspect\u00adive that we think Marx and Engels would have found important, including the impact of internet access, social media and other technologies that brought power and transparency to social movements such as Occupy Wall Street.","created_utc":1520741872,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"TheSutphin","body":"We also think Marx and Engels would update their views about private property. While the abolition of private property was their first and most prominent demand, we think they would recognise that Have-Nots have benefited from property rights. Moreover, we argue that state-held property is problematic, leading to waste, inefficiency and the likelihood of being co-opted by the Haves in our societies today. As the role of the state has grown, inequality has also grown. And the Have-Nots have been the ones who have paid for it. Banks have been bailed out, being deemed too big to fail, and public services have suffered when public-private partnerships fail. As we write in our Manifesto \u201c\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009the complete power of the Haves is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating wealth and influence, deriving from the ruthless and cynical exploitation of the Have-Nots by the Haves\u201d.\n\nIn the third section, \u201cSocialist vs Activist in Practice\u201d (previously \u201cSocialist and Communist Literature\u201d), our reimagined Marx and Engels update their perspective on ideological change given the realities of a hyper-connected world. The original Manifesto outlined three types of socialist approaches and the weakness of each. A modern incarnation of Marx and Engels also would surely call out the shortcomings of financial activists, environmental activists and local political activists with their \u201csiloed\u201d mentalities and approaches. We call out each, lamenting, for example, that the last words of environmentalism are sadly limited to \u201cSwampy, Earth Day, Greenham Common and composting\u201d.\n\nBut we think a modern Marx and Engels would be less philosophically minded and more focused on dramatic changes in technology. They would probably have disparaged inequalities arising from modern technologies, just as they bemoaned the effects of 19th-century manufacturing, commerce and navigation. We also think they would have been open to the protection of intellectual property rights and would have favoured more equal distribution of high-speed connectivity.\n\nAlthough inequality is a dominant theme in both the old and new Manifestos, we determined early on in our reimagining that Marx and Engels would need to update their specific proposals in order to be taken seriously today. Even the most radical or reactionary members of modern society are likely to cringe at some portion of the 10 substantive planks in the original platform of the Communist Manifesto.\n\nIf Marx and Engels were alive today, they would almost certainly be nostalgic for their proposals, but we think they also would recognise the benefit of a wholesale reimagining. (For our revised top 10, a list we think they would endorse today, see Life &amp; Arts.)\n\nMarx and Engels were revolutionaries, but also pragmatic. They wanted their ideas to be discussed as real alternatives. If they were alive today we are convinced they would promote activism as a powerful social force, if only the activists in various areas \u2014 financial, environmental, political, corporate and social \u2014 could unite. There is a strand of activism running through not only the Arab Spring, Trump, Brexit and Macron, but also through hedge funds pressuring underperforming companies, companies themselves advocating for change, environmental groups targeting polluters and social platforms such as Change.org and so on.\n\nMoreover, many Haves too are activists already today, often pushing for various of our 10 listed policies. Think of the billionaires such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg, who already support philanthropic efforts to alleviate inequality. Likewise, many corporations already advocate for environmental and social causes; state-of-the-art approaches to corporate governance already take into account pay inequality, workers\u2019 rights and more.\n\nIf Marx and Engels had been readers of the FT they would have been critics of financial innovation\n\nTo be clear, we are not expecting, or campaigning for, revolution. We certainly are not arguing for the overthrow of free-market capitalism. But we think there are lessons from our reimagining, especially in our age of an increasingly fractured society. The original Manifesto was born out of disparate social movements that needed a unifying set of propositions to come together. We face a similar situation today.\n\nMany, if not most, FT readers will see a potential rebirth of Marx and Engels as idealistic fancy \u2014 if not downright dangerous. Nearly 200 years after Marx\u2019s birth, many of his views have become mere caricatures. But in our close reading of The Communist Manifesto, roughly three-quarters of the original prose deserves to survive. Anyone with an activist bent would benefit from taking the historical journey we have taken, walking through those words, feeling their reverberations, picking out the wisdom even as we discard the error.\n\nOur broad message is that in general, in these polarised times, we should take seriously the opposing view. We imagine a world in which all of us, including the most radical of activists, peek outside of our comfortable silos. It wouldn\u2019t hurt if such a view struck a chord of fear, as well as hope.\n\nHere is our final paragraph, just before \u201cActivists of All Countries, Unite!\u201d Again, we echo the original:\n\n\u201cThe activists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the Haves tremble at an Activist revolution. The Have-Nots have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.\u201d\n\nRupert Younger is the co-author of \u2018The Reputation Game\u2019 and director of Oxford University\u2019s Centre for Corporate Reputation.

{"author":"FlocksThePower","body":" For Lenin and other revolutionaries, the question is not \"going through\" capitalism as if it were the first stage of a rocket launch.  Rather it is how to advance the democracy of the people in order to establish and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and to abolish capitalist relations overall in the struggle for communism under socialism. Lenin clarified that under imperialism, imperialist states oppress entire nations, including an oppressed national bourgeoisie, who must either be compradors to imperialists, and whose interests are hence subjugated, or which can join popular struggle against imperialist oppression. The relation of dominance in oppressed nations  often results in the retardation of productive forces overall in such countries, and the continued existence of feudal or semi-feudal relations of production there, which better serve the machinations of imperialist control. Hence there is a need to abolish such relations, but not for the sake of \"going through capitalism\" (something which implies going through a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, something revolutionaries always need to clearly oppose), but rather for the sake of abolishing oppression (including slavery and serf relations).  Capitalist relations still exist in various forms  under socialism (if they did not it would not be socialism but communism), but there is a basis to methodically abolish them under this form of society. This is sometimes referred to as the abolition of the \"four-alls\"    1) The abolition of class distinctions generally. 2) The abolition of all the relations of production on which they rest. 3) The abolition of all the social relations that correspond to these relations of production. 4) The revolutionizing of all the ideas that result from these social relations. see http://massline.org/Dictionary/FO.htm\n In contrast, under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, the ruling capitalists/imperialists constantly claim that their interests actually represent the interests of all the people. This is an old argument. It currently is used both by the capitalists in China, as well in the U.S. (though in the U.S. they do not use communist imagery as national props). It seems to be the dominant line on this board. Lenin on Imperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism is important to read on these subjects: https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/ and Mao on the Analysis of Classes in Chinese Society https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_1.htm","created_utc":1520791509,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"Lenin obviously is not in favor of capitalism in Russia because that was the Menshevik position.

But one cannot create capitalism because that road has been closed by imperialism. That is the entire point of Marxism-Leninism.\n\nThe point of the work in question is to then explain what socialism means and how it differs from state capitalism if they share a common road. The answer is\n\n&gt;Exchange is freedom of trade; it is capitalism. It is useful to us inasmuch as it will help us overcome the dispersal of the small producer, and to a certain degree combat the evils of bureaucracy; to what extent this can be done will be determined by practical experience. *The proletarian power is in no danger, as long as the proletariat firmly holds power in its hands, and has full control of transport and large-scale industry.*\n\nThus, Lenin expands the idea of multiple modes of production existing at the same time. Socialism is predominant because it has political power but most importantly because it controls the *commanding heights of the economy.*\n\nAll of this is literally foundational to Marxism, to the point where even the revisionist CCP dares not claim it is doing anything different than Lenin.

{"author":"Ozcom","body":"The Communist Party of Australia was founded in 1920.  In 1964 there was a split and the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist) was founded.  The original CPA was left with a reformist Euro-communist faction and a revisionist Khrushchovite faction.  The reformists had the upper hand and the pro-Soviet group left and formed the Socialist Party of Australia.  The reformists liquidated the CPA - formally disbanded it.  The SPA then reclaimed the name of the CPA. There remain ideological, political and organisational differences between this CPA and the CPA (M-L), but both parties are talking to each other and trying to work together in the interests of the working class.  They recently issued a joint statement on the  occasion of the centenary of the Great October Socialist Revolution (see http://vanguard-cpaml.blogspot.com.au/2017/10/honour-and-learn-from-great-russian.html)\n\nThe characterisation of the two-stage theory is unfair to the CPA (M-L).  The position as put forward at the 14th Congress in 2015 is as follows: \"The two-stage Australian strategy for independence and socialism\nThe realisation that a two-stage theory of revolution accorded with the characteristics of Australia as a developed capitalist country dominated by US imperialism emerged and was accepted by us in the early 1970s.  Comrade E.F. Hill led theoretical development of this strategy and our younger comrades enthusiastically implemented it both within the Party and in a number of mass organisations influenced by us.\nIn developing and implementing this policy, two erroneous lines emerged.  The first was a rightist tendency to deny the socialist content of the theory, to over-emphasise patriotism and the maintenance of a national bourgeois economy during the first stage of the revolution.  In effect, this line accepted some form of intermediate stage between the anti-imperialist revolution and the socialist revolution. Its adherents discouraged mention of socialism for fear of alienating allies in the struggle against US imperialism. This line was publicly criticised in February 1978 in \u201cFor independence and socialism\u201d.  This document clearly stated that the struggle for independence must not weaken the sentiment for socialism.\nFrom the left came a movement led by some previously influential younger members of the Party. This group started to organise a faction within the Party in 1977. By then their erroneous position on the two-stage revolution (over-emphasising the socialist objective and dismissing the patriotic non-socialist elements within the united front) was caught up in their support of the \u201cGang of Four\u201d in China.  They tried to establish a group in opposition to the Australian Independence Movement led by Party activists.  Their influence quickly waned.\nThe legacy of our development of the two-stage theory of revolution is that a number of people and organisations on the Left still mistakenly ascribe to us a position that is similar to the rightist line mentioned above.  For three decades or more we have been maligned as \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201cnationalists\u201d.  They essentially continue to criticise us for believing in some form of intermediate stage between capitalism and socialism. Mainly Trotskyite in their own ideological commitment, they reject the two-stage theory of revolution, shouting loudly against imperialism in the context of international arenas of struggle, but denying that it is the main enemy of the Australian people and main target of an initial stage of revolutionary struggle in this country.  In opposing the first, anti-imperialist stage of the Australian revolution they portray Australia as an imperialist country in its own right, a situation which, if it was correct, would place an exclusively working class revolution on the agenda.  It is true that some Australian capitalists engage in imperialist activity in their own right, but they do not constitute the majority of the Australian bourgeoisie and their activities are not so representative of that bourgeoisie or so independent of US imperialism as to be able to characterise the Australian state as an independent imperialist entity.\nThere is no intermediate stage between capitalism and socialism embedded in our two-stage theory of the Australian revolution. During the first stage, assets belonging to the imperialists and their local compradors will be expropriated by new organs of state power and pressed into service for the benefit of the majority of Australia\u2019s working class and its allies. The first stage, the anti-imperialist stage, is defined by the socialist character of that expropriation which can only occur under working class leadership exercised through working class organs of state power. \nGiant foreign multinational corporations have killed off many Australian capitalist firms. Some Australian capitalists see potential for growth in working for and with imperialist corporations and financiers; however, imperialism is predatory and cares nothing for the capitalists of other countries who will always be threatened by it. Sooner or later all will face ruin from imperialist competition. It may be that some of them will see the sense of allowing the anti-imperialist movement to develop.  Some may contribute financially or in other ways to that movement.  Is it impossible that as the anti-imperialist movement develops and grows, that a section of the Australian capitalists will permit their workers to engage in paid time and without penalty in anti-imperialist demonstrations and rallies?  Is it impossible that they might not cooperate with the revolutionary movement in ensuring supplies of food and other necessities to suburban areas under the control of an anti-imperialist front? Is it impossible that some might provide needed services to an anti-imperialist state power in exchange for a guarantee of continued existence within a private sector enclave of a socialist economy? The division of the Australian revolution by stages means that some sectors of the economy owned by national bourgeois elements who are either supportive of, or neutral towards, the anti-imperialist stage will still operate as capitalist businesses into the period of the second stage, necessitating the deepening of the socialist revolution and its embrace of all economic functions throughout the second stage.  This will be a period during which the proletarian organs of state power license the operations of cooperative Australian capitalists whilst directing them towards activities which strengthen the socialist orientation of the economy, eventually resulting in their absorption into that economy as socialist concerns with appropriate compensation to their former owners. Thus there is an overlap with the first stage melding into the second stage, both having predominantly socialist content, and certainly no intermediate national bourgeois economic stage between capitalism and socialism.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, the CPA also has a two-stage revolutionary theory although theirs differs in that the first stage is defined as a democratic stage.  \n\n\n\n","created_utc":1520845536,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Blackbelt54","body":"I think the answer is complicated, and that there are several key factors. One, that people have already mentioned, was McCarthyism. Another important factor is racism, because white workers often align with their white bosses against their own long-term interests. Another factor is that the U.S. has always been a bourgeois country, and thus there was no \"bourgeois revolution\" against feudalism in which the working class got to participate in carrying out democratic tasks. France, on the other hand, had a bourgeois revolution with wide working-class participation, so the working class in France has more of a legacy of struggle.\n\nFor further reading, check out *Prisoners of the American Dream* by Mike Davis and *Settlers: the Mythology of the White Proletariat* by J.

Next, I move to the species-threatening problems capitalism cannot structurally address. I never talk about justice or fairness because almost everyone is doing better than someone, and because they're terrified they could become less fortunate, they read \"fairness\" as \"I'm going to take what's yours and give it to someone else.\"\n\nThen I explain how capitalism deprives us all\u2014even capitalists\u2014of a much better world. When my coworker (a young woman) told the story about her friend, who's also in her early twenties, and her rare, terminal cancer, I explain that it's exactly the need for profit that has caused this cancer to have so few treatments. This situation can happen to anyone, even the well-off, because we apportion resources according to their ability to create profit. In a system where resources were allocated according to reason, a family member with talent and access to education and resources might dedicate his or her life to eradicating this rare cancer so that no one ever has to go through that again.\n\nBasically, I don't ask people to feel bad for the less fortunate. The human mind has too many defense mechanisms against it due to being acculturated by capitalism. I speak directly to how EVERYONE'S lives are poorer due to how resources are allocated under capitalism. At that point, I have them in a conversation and we go back and forth about human nature and labor motivation because those are usually the next concerns for people who sense that something isn't working about the way the world works. Usually, if I'm talking to a liberal, I describe all the reasons liberalism doesn't work with examples.

Dicks are considered influential in introducing the sound of hardcore punk and incorporating blues rock influences into their sound.\n\nThe band went through two distinct incarnations in the early 1980s, changing its lineup when singer Gary Floyd moved from Austin to San Francisco in 1983.\n\n***\n\n**Redskin (subculture)**\n\nIn the context of the skinhead subculture, a redskin is a socialist, communist, or anarchist skinhead. The term combines the word red, (a slang term for socialist or communist) with the word skin, which is short for skinhead. Redskins take a militant anti-fascist and pro-working class stance.\n\nThe most well-known organization associated with redskins is Red and Anarchist Skinheads (RASH).\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/communism/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1520913779,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"[deleted]","body":"I think you're basically on to something and the people who say \"communism isn't lifestylism\" are usually missing an important point or are stopping discussion that should be taking place.\n\n\"From each according to their ability, *to each according to their need*.\" But what defines \"need?\" The average Amerikan will say they have different needs than the average miner in the Congo, for example. Should the miner upgrade their needs or should the Amerikan downgrade their needs? Then we have to ask about whether or not that lifestyle is universalizable, sustainable, sensible. Should they stay the same? Then we risk the miner being envious, or more importantly, having the planet still ruined by Amerikan living standards.\n\nI think we must be properly holistic and we must take into account ecology and physics and, in a word, natural science as a whole. Climate change, i.e. the capitalist destruction of nature is a reality we have to deal with carefully and scientifically, and general \"needs\" clearly figures into that. We can't have every person on the planet needing gas-guzzling cars, a constant supply of new tech, a vast supply of meat, etc., etc. The world physically cannot support the lifestyles of much of the first world, and that will have to be taken into account when planning and regulating production. To reiterate, for Marxism to be scientific it must grapple with the society/technology/nature dialectic.\n\nBut I do agree with the general sentiment here that you should be reasonably easy on yourself for having to deal with capitalism, and that changing your personal lifestyle will not change society. Remember that only classes revolutionize society, and that the proletarian class is the only one that can abolish class itself.","created_utc":1520915034,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"predalienmack","body":"Sorry for being long-winded here, it\u2019s just that I have discussed this topic numerous times with some of my close comrades and with many of my liberal friends who are on the fence about socialism, so bear with me: \n\nI believe the most fundamental thing to explain to people about communism (at least in Western capitalist countries) is to start with a term they are familiar with, and are subsequently likely to have a positive association towards: democracy. Explain that communists believe that democracy of the workplace and democracy in the political sphere go hand in hand, and that democracy in the political sphere (which we are indoctrinated into believing we have by our education systems in capitalist countries) cannot really exist when there is not democracy in the workplace. Communism, which is a classless, stateless, and moneyless society, cannot be brought about without democratizing society. The division of people by class, the state apparatus as a tool of exercising the will and power of the capitalist class, and money as the expression of the power of capital, are all fundamental structures keeping the capitalist system functioning, so breaking those structures down are essential for enabling a communist society to exist. \n\nWhen the control of capital is in the hands of a single person or a small group of people (the capitalist(s)/boss(es)/etc.), this translates directly into those people having disproportionate control over the society as a whole because they can use the gains they acquire from that capital to exercise political power, which the masses don\u2019t have in this worker/boss relationship. Communists seek to change that dynamic by democratizing control of the essential productive forces of society, and therefore society as a whole. Communists see the way control over these productive forces is organized under capitalism as unjust and dehumanizing for the majority of people. Wage labor turns working people into a commodity to be bought and sold under the guise that they are buying and selling their labor for their own gain (when it is the owner(s) and boss(es) who really gain from this exploitative relationship dynamic). A communist society would see the end of that exploitation and the fundamental structures of our current society that allow for these alienating and exploitative relationships to exist in the first place. \n\nMarxists have had the most success in combating the dictatorial capitalist system out of all communists/socialists so far in history due to the more organized and dynamic methods of analysis that are the basis of Marxist thought and action, namely dialectical materialism. Marxism is at its heart a critique of the capitalist system, and Marxists acknowledge that we must understand the capitalist system in order to transform it into something new and different. These methods of analysis that Marxism relies on result in differing interpretations of *how* society is going to transition from capitalism into socialism/communism, which is natural because material conditions differ based on time and place. These dynamic forms of analysis allow for differing conclusions surrounding the questions of how and when these changes can be brought about, which creates the atmosphere for healthy debate and compromise to a certain degree, which is by extension essential in a democratic society. It is critical to understand that, from a Marxist perspective, this complete transformation of the capitalist system is impossible to enact overnight, and that democratizing society and socializing people into this new power dynamic is a process, one that is achieved through a determined and focused struggle against current power structures and the capitalists themselves. \n\nI think these points cover most of your bases when it comes to explaining the ideas at the basis of communism, as well as the inevitable questions as to why experiments in history with the goal of communism in mind have had different forms and varying levels of success. Marxism is not utopian: it is not aiming to create a perfect society, because a perfect society without problems is an impossible goal. Marxists merely aim to work towards rectifying the contradictions and inherent problems of capitalist society by changing the power dynamics and transforming society as a whole into something new through actions based on an analysis of the material realities of society.

Very much in tune with painting the concept, which is a very socialist and communistic one - of public use of public resources for the public good - into what I can't really describe as anything but 'arbeit macht frei' thought; where both notions of a public good or a public service as well as labour for a purpose towards such an end are both put into the basket of \"welfare capitalism\" and we should all embrace 'communism' tainted by notions of all this being bad, China putting things that were previously public goods on the market as being *good*, and commercialization with the exclusion of public control as being yet another good.\n\nChina's domestic conditions are and have been for the past few decades hyper capitalist. This is where people went to push capital for easy gains, with zero restrictions and immensive gains.\nPrevious public goods - like healthcare and a secure living condition that could at least be somewhat realized under Mao, are completely gone.\nYou now pay for medical services, with competing hospitals, some better than others - some for 'rich only'.\nIt's like an erasure of Deng, and in the worst case a whitewashing of the capitalist sellout that occurred. This has gone beyond defending the political control that to extent still holds some power in China, to defending the insane capital accumulation and pure capitalist concentration of wealth within China. I've seen a few complete idiots reporting from China on how \"communistic\" China is, and that description is more or less my opinion of them, I have no idea where they reside. They certainly do not reside nor live within the reality of China, which is in any urban area cut throat, extremely capitalistic and with more or less no labour rights adhered to whatsoever. The media you'll see in China is the exact same you'd see in the west, the commericals and commodification? The exact same. The corporate environment? The exact same.\n\nThe entire superstructure if you actually are there, is capitalistic, as most certainly are the wages. I see this 'sliding' of many forums in not just defending China against the US capital center, but actually trying to paint it as a beacon of communism, as nothing more than yet another astroturfing shitfest of a campaign by Capital Interests Affiliates. China is where international capital went, to make a ton of profit - with no restraints. Urban areas in China are run and fuelled by migrant workers from rural areas of China not because of Malthusian logic - but because of capitalist logic, to fuel not the resources needed for everyone but the siphoning of profit from capitalist enterprises into the hands of a very few - a 'very few' that happen to be the highest level of inequality probably in the world, at the moment. From 2000 rmb a month to a multi billionaire in USD... THAT is Chinese social interactivity today. And 2000 rmb would be high for a migrant worker in Shanghai, for that matter, not that any of you propagandist airheads would even know that.\n\nChina is complicated, but not in the way it's being astroturfed now on the 'communist' side as being.\nCapital, has immense power in China.","created_utc":1520956425,"score":-1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Pretty recently I [wrote on this very issue](https://anti-imperialism.org/2018/02/28/armed-resistance-gun-control-and-inherent-capitalist-violence/)\n\n&gt; This shooting should be no surprise: violence is inherent to the society of the murderous empire... Hedges makes a good point, as does Dunbar-Ortiz. However, Hedges seems to whitewash any history of armed resistance by the oppressed over U$ history, likely because of his beliefs in \u201cpeaceful\u201d revolution, a laughable concept if I ever heard one. In terms of gun violence, there is a better way forward, which is not posed by Hedges... One can, as a start, push for the banning of \u201cROTC from public schools,\u201d against expanded military recruitment, and further militarization. This obviously will not address gun violence at its root. That would require, all armaments should be taken away from the capitalist state and its armed forces. This includes the military, police forces, and any other forces of terror in society as a whole. Some may say this is impossible in a capitalist society as the bourgeoisie would never allow this, which is the reality. As such, there would need to be a revolution in the empire, as it splinters and explodes into different pieces, benefiting the world as a whole, giving an opportunity for the proletariat, allowing these weapons to be taken away. Of course, this cannot be imposed from above, and has to be a process of working with the proletariat itself, as anything but this approach would be fundamentally elitist and betray efforts to build a revolution.","created_utc":1521001476,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

But I agree that it's worrying that they do have so much influence, but that's sadly a necessary evil in this world, as to why that's a necessary evil I'll let the author speak for himself\n\n\n\"The social-economic logic of the CPC's 'opening up' policy isn't just the development of productive forces, and I wish I could have clarified this in the article but I was aware that I needed to keep it concise. In the 70s and 80s, Western capitalism encountered a profitability crisis where the rising organic composition of capital combined with resource shocks caused an enormous shift in industrial capital from the Global North to the Global South. The CPC began the course of modernisation-with-socialist-markets in the early 1980s, coincidentally when capital was searching for new territories to which they could move to in order to restore profit-rates. China, through warmer diplomatic relationships with the US, managed to secure much of this southward capital flow. The rippling consequence of this early shift was that even as the profitability of shifting production to China declined relative to countries like India, the proximity of industries of China continually pulled in more and more capital (for example, if you were a microchip manufacturer, you would consider moving your operations to China instead of India because in China there would be other manufacturers already based there who you could get your inputs from). Ironically, the contradictions of international capitalism forced it to contribute to China's modernisation programme, and this process is still occurring today. As long as it is more profitable to run an industrial operation in China than it is in the West, essentially \"free\" capital (in the form of factories, infrastructure, and technology) will flow from the West to China.\n\nThe other major reason is technology capture. By the last quarter of the 20th century, the USSR was frantically copying microelectronic designs from the West, who often sabotaged their technology before providing it to the USSR. The compounding effects of the technology lag were (and I'm aware this is a heavily disputed subject) the major reason behind the USSR's declining growth and its failure to intensify production and raise labour efficiency. The problem with China came much earlier: after the Sino-Soviet split, the USSR recalled all of its technology loans and personnel, and prevented technological exchange in the form of patents between the two countries. The problem China was faced with became: how can we keep up to date with the latest technology? This was an intractable problem in a \"closed\" economy (lord, I hate that word): if you wanted to design a tractor, you would first need people capable of assembling them and people capable of constructing the parts needed to assemble them, and people to teach people how to do all of those things -- there always existed the possibility of reinventing the wheel and trying to catch up with the West from first principles, but the CPC rightfully rejected this path and opted for joint enterprises with majority state ownership and minority Western ownership. This meant three things: 1. when something was invented in either of those companies, because of international intellectual property law China could plausibly claim the right to produce that thing, 2. China suddenly had immediate access to all Western technology as soon as it was invented, and 3. China could simply purchase Western companies outright if they needed access to technology - something that the USSR was never able to do. Nowadays, this relationship has been inverted: China already has the requisite scientific and technological knowledge and leads the world in innovation, and Silicon Valley is the copy-cat. This is why joint partnerships are approved by Chinese regional governments with less frequency and why contracts are not being renewed. Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go.\"\n\n","created_utc":1521083939,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"TheYetiCaptain1993","body":"The 3 most historically relevant and important \"internationals\" are the International Workingmen's Association (sometimes called the First International), The Second International, and the Communist International (sometimes just called the Third International)\n\n1. The First International was an attempt to unite all anticapitalist movements and ideologies in creating a framework for an international anticapitalist revolution.  The organization broke apart in the aftermath of the failed Paris Commune for the reasons stated in my previous comment.  \n\n2. The Second International was formed in 1889. It was an explicitly socialist organization that sought to unite the various European Labour parties.  This organization created May Day and International Women's day.  This organization fell apart in 1916 when it was evident that the working classes of the major imperial powers would not unite to end World War I and bring about anti capitalist revolution.  \n\n3. The Communist International, also called the Third International or the Comintern, was the last major International and existed from 1919-1943.  It was founded in the aftermath of the October Revolution, the first successful anti-capitalist revolution.  While the 1st international encompassed nearly all of the anticapitalist left, and the 2nd international encompassed a variety of socialist ideologies, the 3rd was exclusively for practitioners of the ideology practiced by the Bolsheviks, which was later to be identified as Marxism Leninism.  International communist parties that adopted the Bolshevik's tactics joined this organization to coordinate with other parties from other nations.  The Comintern was dissolved in 1943 when it was realized that the various communist parties had to adopt their own tactics appropriate to their own national contexts.  \n\nthis is a super simplified and short summery that leaves out most of what these organizations did, but it should hopefully help understand a little of what people are talking about when they refer to one of the 3 internationals ","created_utc":1521172342,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"WhatAWorldPhotos","body":"Revolution in the United States would be very unpredictable. It really depends on the tendency of the group carrying out this revolution. However, below is my ideal revolution. I do not identify with a tendency other than libertarian Marxism, but I lean DeLeonist.\n\nFirst, some context. I am very pan-socialist. I think ideology, tendency, and differences in theory should not matter until we are actually in power. This unnecessary sectarianism is what kills socialism in the USA.  Let's say the United Socialist Party (imaginary party) builds a coalition with the Industrial Workers of the World (largest revolutionary union). DeLeonism's main principle is the party and the union should cooperate extensively. Scenario below.\n\nSocialist candidates would start running in elections, especially municipal ones. Socialists would run in elections to the Senate, but not aiming to win. Every vote they get is class conciousness. Every campaign add or televised speech people see builds this class conciousness. Just people being aware they are being oppressed is nesecary for revolution. (This is actually already happening. Parties like PSL and SAlt target municipal seats. DSA backs socialist candidates for state legislator.) Just the fact people identify with a class is a good thing. Because once people understand class, they can understand class war.\n\nOkay. Now let's take are imaginary United Socialist Party. They are running municipal candidates left and right. Socialists win mayoral seats and state legislator in the historically most progressive/labor like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Illinois. The USP and Industrial Workers of the World (IWW and union) sign onto an agreement of mutual cooperation. The IWW launches coordinated strikes in cities across the USA. In cities with socialist governments, these strikes would of course be protected. In cities were the police won't protect workers, Antifa will.\n\nMore socialist candidates run for office in the Great Plains. These unusual candidates run on a platform of agrarianism and socialism to aid the common farmer. They are extremely populist, by nature. This is the appeal of a true American sociaist party. Agrarian socialists and anarchists run in the rural farming states. Democratic socialists, Marxists, and others run in urban states and cities. These candidates openly support the IWW and encourage membership. Don't worry; the USP will return the favor. Once socialists win state legislators, they can pass socialist bills and further distance their states from the feds. This creates a climate of tension and class conflict.\n\nEventually the IWW calls for a general strike. This would involve picket lines, occupying workplaces, school walkouts, and your everyday strike. These are protected by the city, as they are governed by socialists. See how DeLeonism's helpful? These massive strikes would begin to paralyze the economy and, if the police and Antifa are protecting the protesters, the feds have one option: send in the military. Notice how this has all been peaceful. Imagine you are a soilder. You are ordered to shot at a group of possibly armed protesters and definitely armed police/Antifa. They have done nothing but peacefully protest. What would you do? Shot a police man. Maybe, but this is how you get the military on your side.\n\nAny revolution in a developed capitalist nation nowadays needs the military on their side. They need to turn the executive against itself. Otherwise, they will just be crushed. This is how it would happen. With nothing to stop them, revolutionaries are escorted by police, Antifa, and the military into City halls, state capitols, Congress, and, eventually, the White House. That's what you call a successful revolution.","created_utc":1521181070,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"Syndicalism made sense as a kind of infantile leftism at the turn off the century. The IWW was a necessary form for its time but it's clear that the radicals like Haywood and Connolly became communists, the moderates like Debs and De Leon became socialists , and the reactionary mass unfortunately became trade unionists, anti-communists, and pro-war. America has never seen a mass party like the IWW for material reasons (it has never seen such a mass proletarian immigration of a multinational character since) so it's no surprise people would nostalgize about it, particularly white petty-bourgeois who imagine they can still mimic the politics of formerly oppressed white nations (Irish, Jews, Italians, etc). But if you cannot follow the radicals to communism that is because you are reactionary. And since the reason for the split was the question of imperialism, it means you are objectively a racist and enemy of the world proletariat (like the AFL and second international), a condition that has only become worse considering the much greater power of imperialism today compared to the first world war.","created_utc":1521240014,"score":23,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"pottypanda13","body":"We did try to spread the message around on the net. However organising in India doesn't work the same way as in the US or maybe other western countries.   \n\nEmails - Facebook posts and pamphlets are all good. But what really gets people on the streets is the good old door knocking. The rally did get a lot of traction in the media and the government did give in to the farmer demands. However giving into demands is a different thing and actually implementing them in the budget is different. \n\nWhy this particular rally is very important for the Communists is because it marks a return of the Communist parties to where they are supposed to be. In the streets and amongst the labour class.  \n\nCommunism in India has been very popular with the educated middle and lower middle class(I am using this classification because I don't know whether to use \"petty bourgeois\" because I don't know how caste-class would interplay). Indian academia, civil society and a significant section of the independent media is left wing. Over a period of time Indian left found leaders not just from the Naxalbari movement but also from middle class families. The fallout was eventually that the Communist party politburo slipped out of the hands of the labour class to middle class and above.  \n\nThis event is important because the Communist parties have returned to where they belong. These section of Indian electorate don't have any online presence whatsoever. The farmers you would see in the news reports are not the India that is in the cities and large segment of them wouldn't even have access to the internet. Using the internet as a medium of organising is mostly what the urban left does. This is a grassroots movement - I wish I had the right words to explain it in English. In Bengali we would say \"mati'r theke uthe asha\" - roughly translated as something that starts from the soil and comes up to fruition. Soil being a reference to the farmer. Their online presence isn't much and probably tending to zero.  \n\nThe urban left is largely disconnected from this section because most of the urban left while being left doesn't like associating with the Communist party flag. Let's just say I didn't vote for the Communist parties after my first election and that is because the history they had in my state. The disconnect is what kept the rally a low key affair online but rest assured it had its impact on Indian media. \n\nIn another news - the socialists have aligned with \"lower\" caste parties and defeated the right wing in bypolls in constituencies which have been historically right wing for 30 years or more. I use the term \"lower\" because I didn't know whether you guys know about BSP and their fight for Dalit rights. They are not lower in any means whatsoever. SP is the socialist party and it aligned BSP which fights for the oppressed castes to defeat the right wing.  \n\nIf not in 2019 but by 2024, India is going to see a move towards the left. It might not be a communist state but rest assured calling yourself a socialist isn't that much of a problem in India as it is in the US and it's only going to get easier as we head towards 2024.

This article doesn't say it specifically, but she  has been married to Kim Jong in 2009 or 2010, and they at least one child whom is named Ju Ae (born in 2013), along with reportedly two others. She was \"a 27-year old graduate student at Kim Il-sung University, pursuing a Ph.

Bourgeois media claims she was reportedly a cheerleader and singer but this can't be confirmed. Also, reportedly she is \"charming\" and had a soft voice, if that the personal sushi chef for Kim Jong-il, Kenji Fujimoto,  man who defected from the country, is right.

It is widely accepted that partners will \"consent\" to sex with their partners to keep a relationship stable for abuse reasons, and it's recognized that this is not a true form of consent. Could the same not happen for financial reasons? A woman \"consenting\" to sex with her husband in order to maintain income because she has no \"market friendly\" skills? Is it really consent? \n\nThe real idea behind it is to establish that people cannot truly be free, nor can they truly consent to anything until socialism. \n\nAnti BDSM as I've studied over the last month is similar in aims. BDSM is hetero normative because it inverts male domination for female domination. Feminism as a goal doesn't seek female *domination.* And in fact, this practice only reinforces the demonization of feminist goals, that women just want to \"be in charge.\" \n\nThis means that both \"sex is rape\" and BDSM hinge on the same idea, that *consent under capitalism is meaningless.* If you take away meaningful consent from either situation, what is left? This is what's examined by radical feminists, and why (if I'm interpreting my study correctly) that the conclusions are anti BDSM, and sex is rape. \n\nI hope this helped you understand a bit, I'm still studying.

{"author":"predalienmack","body":"While I do want the youth demographic to be empowered and I want them to desire to take action politically, this mass mobilization around gun regulation feels to me like the youth are being manipulated by liberal ideology to literally try to disempower the masses using a misguided hysteria surrounding the real problem of mass shootings. This could very much be a preemptive strike by elements of the ruling class to disempower working class people because capitalists and their lapdog politicians realize that people are pissed off and want major changes, and it is in the capitalist\u2019s benefit to strip the people of their tools to force real societal change that reaches up to the elites. However, that will likely not happen because capitalist weapons manufacturers have such a massive amount of influence in the political sphere as well (capitalists will gladly sell us the rope with which we will hang them, after all). \n\nInstead of confronting the violent realities of the capitalist and imperialist society that the United States exists within (which mass shootings are a symptom of), liberals are instead pushing the blame onto the chosen tool for violence, even though there are numerous other tools a potential mass murderer could use to commit these horrific acts (such as homemade explosives). It feels like another case (of which there have been many in US history) where a massive wave of political energy is being funneled by liberals into protests that do nothing to confront the real problems at hand, which is exactly what liberals in power want to happen when there is dissatisfaction with the status quo. \n\nVoting is not going to solve the problem of mass violence because violence is a systemic and cultural problem, not a problem with the laws and regulations the bourgeoise deems fit to pass into law. Getting the youth excited to get out and vote may in a sense radicalize many because they will quickly realize how ineffectual voting in the capitalist system really is, but I would say that is an inefficient use of resources and energy when people are ripe for actual radicalization due to worsening material and social conditions. We will not bring about socialism or communism by working within the existing political frameworks that the bourgeoise want to give to the masses.

Will Thailand\u2019s new \u201cradical party\u201d also reach out to the Thai trade union movement? Will it propose scrapping restrictions on trade union rights, raising the minimum wage to coincide with the demands of the unions and reduce working hours? How does this fit with the behaviour of Summit Corporation? **The company has a history of sacking trade union activists, enforcing overtime and opposing affective trade unions**.\n\nThis is an important note. When a bourgeois who own a manufacturing company that has long history of anti-union and bad conditions for the workers, decided to form the self-styled radical party with a social democrat academic. You know shit just got real. \n\n&gt; What is worrying is that in the past Piyabutr has said that class \u201cis not an issue in Thailand\u201d.

[See](https://uglytruththailand.wordpress.com/2018/02/18/how-not-to-struggle-for-democracy-in-thailand/)\n\nHere's come a guide to social democrat's bullshit. Notice that every modern social democrats deny class struggle in an explicit manner and sometime revolutionary traditions of many countries. So let's just look at Piyabutr's own words.\n\n&gt;  Dr. Piyabutr Saengkanokkul has suggested that Podemos could be a model for a new political party in Thailand \u201cbecause it goes beyond the left-right divide which, unlike Europe, does not exist in Thailand.\u201d He also claims that a Podemos-like party could heal the rift between the reds and yellows and would be a \u201cnew-style\u201d party.\n\nSo he just pretends what the CPT has done in the past (especially the opposition to the Thai fascist regime, which the CPT was the main force) are all forgotten and now we should just form a new party that apparently \"heal\" the rift between two bourgeois factions that has proven to be disastrous to the proletariat.

Industrial unions serving the interests of the proletariat (working class) will bring about the change needed to establish a socialist system.

You are supposed to read a certain way that reflects intellect according to it (finishing a thick book from start to finish)when in actuality reading is about exploration of concepts. Don't just read the most important book because you feel like you have to. Make sure you are ready for whatever you are reading. This means that the book should be answering whatever questions you are asking. Do a little research. I didn't just randomly pick up Capital, I read it when I had a ton of questions and knew that the only way to get an honest answer was to go to the source. This made it endlessly fascinating. Also have a frame of reference for the philosophical position helps immensely. You dont have to deeply understand Kant and Hegel but maybe do some quick reading on the gist of them. Overall, dive into the concepts. Follow the trail that interests you and oppose book worship. It's not about reading this or that, it's about being immersed iin the conversation.\n\nEdit: I definitely think that I had to see beyond my own liberal ideology to understand Marx.

{"author":"nice_try_western_spy","body":"this is a pretty common understanding of history, but it is important to note that most of these \"truths\" are very flimsy and or are just flat lies. \n\nmillions. millions? in reality these numbers are drastically inflated, yes people did die, but not billions or millions. if this was true then there would be a obvious population dent in lets say the ussr, which was not the case. the ussr's population by its end was way way to high for millions to have been killed. in comparison look at japan, millions died due to the massive bombing campaign and the nukes, and they are still trying to recover from that. the ussr was fine population-wise after it fell, no signs of long term population decline. unless the soviets discovered some way to reproduce at some ungodly rate, then there is no possible way millions upon millions could have died. secondly you assume the people who died were all innocent, of course not, its just like saying all the people that are executed in the US are innocents, uh mostly no. people executed in the ussr were actual class criminals, like yezhov the head of the NKVD for a short time in the 30s. Yezhov was part of the right opposition, which was a big deal at the time a lot of nazis were trying to topple the ussr. Yezhov pretty much arrested people for no reason just to create hate for the party, once he was discovered of course he was shot and over 100,000 people were released from prison. not everyone arrested or killed by socialist countries were poor innocent people, most were actual criminals and murders. this all also applies to china. \n\nthat is, sadly, another very common misinterpretation of lenin's \"last testament\". lenin stated that stalin should be removed from his position, what a lot of trots (mostly trots use the testament argument) don't relize is that stalin had many many jobs in the party, lenin only wanted him to be removed from one of those jobs. secondly lenin also stated that someone exactly like stalin, in mind and thinking, should replace him. the only gripe lenin had was that stalin was too rude, and this was probably due to stalin yelling at krupskaya on the phone. at the time lenin was on his final legs and the party doctors stated that he should not exert himself in anyway, no party work, no newspapers. now lenin being lenin didn't listen and krupskaya and his sister sneaked in newspapers and stuff. when stalin, who was voted to check up on lenin and rely his condition back to the party, found out about this he got very mad because krupskaya was just inching lenin closer to death, so stalin yelled at her about it. this is probably the root of lenin's claim. \n\nanti-stalin polices, yeah of course they did, krushchev was running it now. krushchev was a horrible opportunist who hide in the party and waited to take control. once he did he and his buddies rolled back tons of the socialist reforms that stalin and the party had spent decades on, krushchev started the decline of the ussr and the slow walk away from socialism and towards capitalism. \n\nmao created a mass famine, hmm then why did he also create one of the largest over population issues the world has ever seen? just like in the ukriane and in china these countries have had famines regularly for hundreds of years because they weren't industrialized. once these countries were, then it wasn't a problem anymore, in china's case it actually worked too good. and true, there wasn't a mass proletariat in china, but it wasn't much better in russia either. this is why both china and russia went through NEP style periods to grow the proletariat and to build a industrial base. \n\n","created_utc":1521403265,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Blechhotsauce","body":"One of the major problems of marxists is communicating their message, largely because of reliance on old and inaccessible texts (*Kapital*, for example) and the academicization of theory (anything written by Zizek, for example). When working-class people understand the message, they spread it and embrace it. I think of the American IWW leader Big Bill Haywood, who said \"I've never read Marx's *Capital,* but I have the marks of capital all over my body.\" Because to him, the message of working-class liberation was not stored in books or theory, but in the everyday experience of the workers themselves.\n\nThis leads to the slogan, \"If it's not accessible to the poor, it's not revolutionary.\" Sure, people can get books at the library, but how much sense will reading those books make if they aren't familiar with the entire historiography, theoretical branches, and historical circumstances of the texts? So much marxist theory is now only accessible to people who can afford to go to college and grad school.\n\nThat's why we should spend less time theorizing and more time organizing. Marx said, \"Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.\" Take what you have learned and go into the workplace, into the community center, into the church, into the schoolyard, into the cafe, and speak to people in a language they will understand. That's what the Black Panthers did: they were part of the community, they spoke the language of the people, they appealed to the people, they openly organized in neighborhoods. That's what the IWW did: they went to lumber mills, factories, workshops, and mines and distributed propaganda written in simple English and translated into a dozen other languages so that the workers themselves could grasp it and use it.\n\nMarxism isn't about who can memorize the most words (even \"bourgeoisie\" and \"proletariat\" make you sound like a pretentious twit). It should be about communicating on terms the workers themselves use. The most effective organizers aren't academics, they're workers.","created_utc":1521403945,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

If you are suffering from mental health issues and you are seeing a professional, feel free to talk about your issues and thoughts about the injustices of society, and even some of your thoughts about how you feel they should be corrected. A part of a therapist\u2019s job is to take notes about what you tell them so they can better address and find the source(s) of the issues you are dealing with, and it is up to you to determine whether talking about your political beliefs in that setting will be relevant to getting to the root of the issues you face. Just because they write something down does not mean they are going to report what you say to the feds - most of what they are writing down is notes for themselves to get a better picture of what you are going through. They do have to report you if you indicate that you are going to commit an act of violence against yourself or other specific people - saying that you want to participate in building a mass movement that pushes towards socialism would not qualify under that specified notion, as mass movements aren\u2019t built through individualistic acts of terrorism or uncoordinated violence. \n\nWhen I saw a therapist when I was younger, politics were not a very relevant topic as to why I was depressed, so it wasn\u2019t an issue that was discussed much.

His analysis of cultural institutions and power is still taught in sociology classes. He explained how the capitalist ruling class normalizes new values, and the working class comes to feel that the capitalist system is what is \u201cright\u201d due to institutional indoctrination.\n\n\n##The State and the Civil.   \nHis more broad view of the state helped develop current academic understandings of the split between the the civil and the political. He saw the state as and embodiment of the institutions, not just the government itself. This includes things like the police, which seem obviously part of the state to us now, but I don\u2019t think it was so clear before. His view helps to explain how the capitalist class will try to make the workers feel like things are good for them (through legislation that addresses side effects instead of core issues, giving in to small demands of unions, promising job growth, etc.) when in reality, they are still being exploited.\n\nPlease feel free to add more if you know it.

"body":"I believe a lot of this libertarian hype is related to Hayek\u2019s central point in Denationalisation of Money, where he states that there is no innate reason for governments to have a monopoly on money, and proposed a monetary reform which calls for privately issued, competing currencies. He believed that in order to preserve free enterprise and ensure the survival of market economy, there\u2019s no choice but to replace the governmental currency monopoly and national currency systems by free competition. He makes the case that private banks should be able to issue their own currencies, creating a competitive market for the issuance and control of these currencies. The argument goes that demand will be greatest for currencies which are capable of keeping a stable value, and so banks will strive to manage the monetary supply more responsibly than governments do, and markets, rather than entertaining an unmanageable number of currencies, would converge on one or only a limited number of monetary standards, on which institutions would base the issue of their notes. Thus autistic internet libertarians consider Bitcoin to be a sly roundabout way to introduce \u201cgood\u201d money again and save \u201cmuh free markets.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn a side note, those who insist on the difference between coercive and market-based centralization will tell you that BitCoin is decentralized. A user of fiat is always forced to utilize a centralized service, while a user of Bitcoin is never forced to utilize a centralized service. And while as a blockchain Bitcoin is a distributed systems and not centralized, most of the actual services and businesses built within the Bitcoin ecosystem are *centralized.* They are run in specific locations, with specific computer systems, and they are susceptible to specific legal entanglements, with a very limited number of people making almost all the commits and successful improvement proposals.

It's absurd, of course, but owning a piece of heavy artillery is different from a rifle, even though they're both guns. \n\nIn my opinion the only way that guns are really useful in a revolutionary struggle is against the police. If the army is on the side of the government, you've already lost. It can only succeed if it manages to get the army to join the revolution, in whole or part, or convinces the army to stay neutral. I mean during the Russian Revolution, after the Cossacks and other Army Units had joined the protesters you still had the police shooting people in the street. They're the most immediate threat. To that end I don't really see Assault Rifles being necessary. Normal rifles would work just fine.\n\nThere's also the facts on the ground, which is that there has been a very successful effort for the last 60 years to disarm the working class, and heavily arm the middle and upper classes. The NRA is absolutely the spearhead of that effort. If we want a well-armed working class the NRA must be destroyed, or co-opted. We just shouldn't pretend that the working class of this country has the same stake in gun ownership as the ruling classes. We already have a largely disarmed proletariat in other words.\n\nI don't know, just my thoughts on it. I also think that your end quote is unnecessarily divisive.

It's very easy to talk yourself out of doing anything through the internet and you can always find someone who is disgruntled and wants to complain about their ex-party or just wants to stir up shit.\n\nHere's some advice. If you are in an org for 5 months and can't follow democratic centralism (and your great political strategy everyone needs to listen to is to eliminate it) then you don't belong in a serious party. And that's exactly what happens, that person advocates you join a Facebook group, a vague black power movement that has already sold out to the Democrats and the system of for profit prisons in Mississippi, and the DSA. None of those parties make any demands of their members and allow the wild speculations by each member of \"what is to be done\" because they have no coherent political program. Great for self-important student leftists, of little use to those of us who need experience in politics (which is a real skill you can't learn in books and takes a hell of a lot longer to learn than 5 months). If an org is truly a dead end then drop it, but you will probably work for decades before revolution is possible. That's what Lenin was prepared to do the year before the revolution. Deal with the reality of that and remember that doing nothing is worse than any other option.","created_utc":1521647960,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

As for smaller names, I will give a list of less well known revolutionaries who wrote books that you should definitely read if you are interested in learning about the revolution. \n\u2022 V\u00edctor Dreke. He was a revolutionary who served as second in command of the internationalist column in the Congo led by Che Guevara in 1965 and wrote the book \u201cFrom the Escambray to the Congo\u201d which you can buy here http://www.pathfinderpress.com/s.nl/it.A/id.832/.f\n\n\u2022 Luis Alfonso Zayas became a general of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and he recounts an amazing and enlightening story of his role in the rebellion and the path the revolution took after military victory in the book \u201cSoldier of the Cuban Revolution\u201d, which you can buy here http://www.pathfinderpress.com/Soldier-of-the-Cuban-Revolution-Za\n\n\u2022N\u00e9stor L\u00f3pez Cuba, Enrique Carreras, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez, and Harry Villegas are all generals of the Revolutionary Armed Forces and their words and stories and wisdom should be studied and can be accessed through the book \u201cMaking History\u201d that you can buy here http://www.pathfinderpress.com/s.nl/it.A/id.719/.f\n\n\u2022 Vilma Esp\u00edn, leader of the Cuban Revolution for decades, playing an indispensable role in the fight for women\u2019s liberation during the revolution. She helped write the book \u201cWomen in Cuba: The making of a revolution within a revolution\u201d. You can buy it here http://www.pathfinderpress.com/Women-in-Cuba-Making-a-Revolution-Within-the-Revolution-Espn\n\nWhen it comes to studying the Cuban Revolution, I always think the importance of Che Guevara and Fidel Castro should be emphasized. Their leadership was absolutely crucial and honestly I think they are among the best sources for reading about the revolution. Books by Fidel Castro I truly enjoy included \u201cWar &amp; Crisis in the Americas\u201d, \u201cCuba\u2019s Internationalist Foreign Policy 1975-80\u201d, \u201cCuba at the Crossroads\u201d, \u201cOn Neoliberal Globalization\u201d, \u201cPlaya Gir\u00f3n/Bay of Pigs: Washington\u2019s first military defeat in the America\u2019s\u201d, \u201cNothing Can Stop the Course of History\u201d, and \u201cMy Life\u201d. Books by Che that I recommend include \u201cSocialism and Man in Cuba\u201d, \u201cChe Guevara Talks to Young People\u201d, and \u201cChe Guevara Speaks\u201d. \n\nAs for books about the Cuban revolution written by those who didn\u2019t actually take part in it, I think the best I\u2019ve read was \u201cGuerrillas in Power\u201d by K.S. Karel. \n\nAbove all, the most incredible book I\u2019ve ever read about the Cuban Revolution, and maybe ever, was \u201cFidel Castro Speeches Vol. II Building Socialism in Cuba: Our Power Is That Of The Working People\u201d.

But at the same time, in a broader scale, so was competition - with other tribes, or even other sapien species (Neanderthals). \n\nThis has interested me a lot, because it seems to go against the spirit of a world-wide union embodied in communist principles. At the same time however, the entire concept of the \"tribe\" and one's own \"people\" with whom we feel comradery and society is entirely psychological and subjective. I personally believe that more left-leaning, progressive individuals like communists, socialists et al, are those whose definition of \"tribe\" encompasses essentially all of humanity, whereas more conservative people view their tribe in more clearly defined terms - their skin colour, their nationality, their culture, their social stratus. Within their own tribe, the capacity for selflessness by an otherwise right-wing extremist is really no less than a socialist. Even the Nazis had some fairly progressive ideas when it came to Aryan Germans.\n\nThat's the conundrum.

I hear criticisms of Boots Riley/the Coup, but I think something great about their music is that they are consistently radical without necessarily also being mad/angry the whole time. They have tracks that are absolutely incendiary, like Gunsmoke and Captain Sterling\u2019s Little Problem to songs like I Love Boosters, which is hella anti capitalist but in a really positive way.\n\nAlso something he does which I think is good is that he infuses humor into his work. Humor is disarming. People like it and sadly if you can make your points in a humorous way they\u2019ll often stick better.\n\nAs propaganda, exploring radicality through the whole range of human emotion is a good strategy bc more people will find it relatable. Revolutionary fury is crucial, necessary, indispensable \u2014 just not enough. I\u2019m not against expressing that anger, I just think it is important to temper it.\n\nI agree with finding an organization. That can be difficult in some areas. I wish you luck.

It was confidently believed that it would never fraternize with the workers, because of the legacy of hatred which every repressive action leaves behind it - both in the masses, as a hatred which is also turned against the material instruments of the repression, and in the ranks, because of the memory of the soldiers who have fallen beneath the blows of the insurgents. The Brigade was welcomed by a throng of ladies and gentlemen, who offered the soldiers flowers, cigars and fruit. The state of mind of the soldiers is well captured by the following account, given by a tannery worker from Sassari involved in the first propagandistic soundings: \"I approached a bivouac on X Square (in the first days, the Sardinian soldiers bivouacked in the squares as if in a conquered city) and I spoke with a young peasant, who had welcomed me warmly because I was from Sassari like him. 'What have you come to do in Turin?' 'We have come to shoot the gentry who are on strike.' 'But it is not the gentry who are on strike, it is the workers and they are poor.' 'They're all gentry here: they have collars and ties; they earn 30 lire a day. I know poor people and I know how they are dressed, yes indeed, in Sassari there are lots of poor people; all of us \"diggers\" are poor and we earn I 1/2 lire a day.' 'But I am a worker too and I am poor.' 'You're poor because you're a Sardinian.' 'But if I go on strike with the others, will you shoot me?' The soldier reflected a bit, then put a hand on my shoulder: 'Listen, when you go on strike with the others, stay at home!'.\"\n\nIf you can't understand that the OP is playing the same role as the Sassari soldier - even worse than that, he's the gentry pretending to be a Sassari - I don't know how to help anymore.","created_utc":1521844858,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

Modern liberals believe that mild welfare will do the job. Social democrats, like me, believe we need lots of extreme welfare projects like free healthcare and universal basic income, but that going full communist or capitalist isn't the right answer. \n\nCommunists see capitalism as an inherently broken system where money and power pool at the top. As such, the best way to stop class stratification is to abolish the class system all together through mass redistribution of wealth. I personally disagree with the ideology, but given our current political climate, it's not hard to see what's driven them to such a belief. Said belief just so happens to be considered taboo by our modern society because the few countries that have tried communism out were pretty bad at it.

"body":"&gt; Wages is not how you define a class\n\n\nFrom Lenin's \"A Great Beginning\":\n\n\n&gt; Classes are large groups of people differing from each other by the place they occupy in a historically determined system of social production, by their relation (in most cases fixed and formulated in law) to the means of production, by their role in the social organisation of labour, and, consequently, by the *dimensions of the share of social wealth of which they dispose* and the mode of acquiring it.\n\n\nI never said wages were the only factor determining class. However, I did imply that it played a role. Better wages alone obviously doesn't prove that certain workers are not exploited. Nonetheless, third worldists proposes that even productive workers in the imperialist core aren't exploited, because they receive more surplus value than what they produce, and that surplus value comes from the exploitation of the global proletariat. This, along with the fact that the vast majority of the population of oppressor nations work in what Marx called the \"unproductive sector\", makes the 1st World incapable of carrying out revolution. \n\n\nYou on the other hand, like most first world leftists, implied that relationship to the means of production is the *only* factor determining class - something obviously *wrong* considering cops, white collar managers and Hollywood actors are not proletarian (if you call these people proletarian then you have serious gaps in your understanding of Marxism). \n\n\nedit: In the end, neither wages nor relationship to the MoP alone can determine class. Focusing the former without considering the latter would result in the typical liberal \"lower class, middle class, upperclass\" classification. Focusing on the latter without considering the former, and the function of a group under capitalism would result in all sorts of ridiculous petty bourgeois fantasies (e.g considering engineers who make a 6 digit annual salary as \"proletarian\")","created_utc":1521863678,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

Yes the reason for the left being destroyed in Pakistan is directly related to CIA involvement specifically in the 80s during to soviet afghan invasion. Bhutto who was anti-American by the end of his life (he even was friends with Mao zedong) was hanged publicly by CIA backed fundamentalist general zia huq. He is the one who created the dysmal state Pakistan has suffered from ever since. He used extremism to fight the soviets and did not ever dispel the elements (mostly because as soon as the Americans made their use for him, he was assassinated by the CIA blowing his plane up) instability has haunted our country due to Americans involvement. I do believe Pakistan has a great capability for revolution if not anti imperialist thought (which it already has). Ever since 9/11 specifically Pakistan has been shifted to an ally of America to a dangerous enemy. Pakistan is currently one of if not Americas greatest enemy as they are the only anti american and muslim nation with nuclear capabilities. Revolution is needed to get rid of the petit bourgise government that is now in place but anti imperialist thought is a step in that direction. Hanging of bhutto publicly by General Zia, general Zias polices that brought extremism into Pakistan, and the soviet of invasion of Afghanistan is why communism is a farther possibility in Pakistan. Not to mention the Awami league (originally a pretty radical communist Pakistani party founded by an extrmely radical and revolutionary leader Red Maulana Bhashani) was infiltrated by the CIA a couple decades after its conception as well as weakened by the sino-soviet split as Awami league divided into pro soviet and pro maoist factions.","created_utc":1521970188,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

He misled me in our first interview about his role in the death of his mother, and he continued to do so in more than a dozen interviews. When he changed his story, I became worried about what else he might have made up.\n\n&gt;Fact-checking is not possible in North Korea. Outsiders have not visited its political prison camps.

"body":"&gt;  Mandela was most definitely a revolutionary leader. And by ending the apartheid he did more than we can ever hope to do.\n\nIndeed, but the question was if he was a communist and your argument was important.   \n\n&gt;Mandela advocated the ultimate establishment of a classless society,[384] with Sampson describing him as being \"openly opposed to capitalism, private land-ownership and the power of big money\".[385] Mandela was influenced by Marxism, and during the revolution he advocated scientific socialism.[386] He denied being a communist at the Treason Trial,[387] and maintained this stance both when later talking to journalists,[388] and in his autobiography.[389] According to the sociologist Craig Soudien, \"sympathetic as Mandela was to socialism, a communist he was not.\"[390] Conversely, the biographer David Jones Smith stated that Mandela \"embraced communism and communists\" in the late 1950s and early 1960s,[391] while the historian Stephen Ellis commented that Mandela had assimilated much of the Marxist-Leninist ideology by 1960.[392]\n\n&gt;Ellis also found evidence that Mandela had been an active member of the South African Communist Party during the late 1950s and early 1960s,[118] something that was confirmed after his death by both the ANC and the SACP, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its Central Committee.[120] His membership had been hidden by the ANC, aware that knowledge of Mandela's former SACP involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from Western countries.[393] Mandela's view of these Western governments differed from those of Marxist-Leninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.[394]\n\n&gt;The 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela had helped create, called for the nationalisation of banks, gold mines and land, to ensure equal distribution of wealth.[395] Despite these beliefs, Mandela initiated a programme of privatisation during his presidency in line with trends in other countries of the time.[396] It has been repeatedly suggested that Mandela would have preferred to develop a social democratic economy in South Africa but that this was not feasible as a result of the international political and economic situation during the early 1990s.[396] This decision was in part influenced by the fall of the socialist states in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc during the early 1990s.[397]\n\nThis from wiki was a bit enlightening.","created_utc":1521989683,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

For example in an alternate reality in which Cuba somehow revolutionized much later around 1990 I doubt Fidel would claim communist much less implement communist policies because he would not had the support of USSR.

They were losing their economic status and privileges - at least the few they had. They did not want to lose them and identity was a result to safeguard them. This is a nation and this nation as those customs, those people, those ethnic features, all that is different must not be, for that is the problem that is sinking us. This ideas were fuelled, and also implanted, by a group of middle classes who could see the political capital to be gain by doing so, to overcome the bourgeoise that were currently ruling, those ruling classes who had no problem with race or gender. Hitler and Mussolini did pretty much that; they fuelled the sense of identity against what was already a cosmopolitan class in order to gain power. Not so different to what is happening today.

It goes to the \"owners\" of the means of production who extract surplus value from their employees labour, which also means that a lot of employees probably will not receive a decent wage for any period of time (this has happened in history, particularly recently, when automobile factory workers could live off their pay comfortably, but now they could not, even if there were still those jobs available.) 4.

There are already think tanks urging them to attack before China is too powerful militarily, the US has already surrounded them with bases and is acting in coordination with the EU to enact trade barriers against them. All the North Korea theater is clearly a threat directed at China, too (historically Korea has been the bridge towards China in wars and SK is already a US colony).\n\nThe US is probably the most violent and ruthless empire, second only to the Nazis, in history. They will not abdicate their position as sole superpower without a fight and that fight could well be the last one for most of humanity. It is the only country to ever use nuclear weapons on human beings (civilians at that), they are working on mini-nukes which they deem usable, they explicitly do not deny the option of a nuclear first strike, never did ([Daniel Ellsberg just released a book about this, arguing that this threat is at the core of US foreign policy](https://mronline.org/2018/01/21/dismantling-doomsday-daniel-ellsberg-on-the-risk-of-nuclear-apocalypse/)).\n\nAnd most importantly, you have to understand the situation the planet is in and [the fact that the ruling classes are aware of this.](https://twitter.com/Sexgauner/status/974672027985510400) The planet is being destroyed, resources are being depleted, the imperialist countries are building all kinds of walls to \"defend\" themselves from the hundreds of millions of people who will come fleeing from the ravages of climate change and co. There's not much time left to get as many resources as they can possibly get before the world will be one big slaughter house (worse than anything we've seen before, no doubt).\n\nAnd then we can clearly see that the old imperialist order is already and quickly falling apart. Already the EU is emerging under German rule as a rival power to the US (former German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel was brazen enough to hold several speeches making it explicit before his term ended), there's an open battle for the wealth of Africa between the EU, China and the US. We can see that even [the Monroe Doctrine no longer holds](https://mronline.org/2018/03/10/the-u-s-cant-revive-the-monroe-doctrine-or-expel-china-from-latin-america-but-it-can-inflict-pain-on-the-region/) as China, Russia and EU countries are active in South America. No longer does the US have the absolute supremacy to force all other imperialist nations to comply with them, open imperialist competition is back. A new war of imperialist redivision will come in one form or another, no doubt.\n\nAlas, this is unless there will be revolutions to destroy capitalism for good.\n\nedit: the following is from an excellent article by John Smith [I just posted:](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/877bxh/imperialist_realities_vs_the_myths_of_david_harvey/)\n\n&gt; **Chinese state capitalism (for want of a better term) shows signs of developing a strategic challenge to Japanese, European and North American dominance in key industries**, from robotics, information technology and artificial intelligence to renewable energy, aerospace and nuclear power generation. **These developments, along with sharply increasing military tensions in China\u2019s coastal waters (which have been an American lake since the end of World War II), and the phoney proxy war taking place on and around the Korean peninsula, reinforce the verdict I reached seven years ago\u2014the combination of spreading global capitalist depression and China\u2019s growing challenge to imperialist domination means that we no longer live in a post-World War II world, we live in a pre-World War III world.** Class-conscious workers must maintain independence from both sides in this looming conflict and prepare for the revolutionary openings which capitalism\u2019s deepest-ever crisis is certain to produce. Right now, that means denouncing U.S. aggression against Korea and demanding the withdrawal of its military forces and bases from the west Pacific, opposing Japan\u2019s nuclear rearmament, and also opposing Chinese capitalist expansion and the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s attempts to forge an alliance with reactionary capitalist regimes in Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and other countries in the path of its \u2018One Belt, One Road\u2019.","created_utc":1522049153,"score":68,"subreddit":"communism"}

This should help you engage the debate on this administration's own terms, and can be a jumping off point for a qualitative analysis of the harms of privatized prisons.\nhttps://www.epsu.org/sites/default/files/article/files/luhndahl-prisons-.pdf\n\nFrom the Journal of Law &amp; Politics (2003), a comparative analysis of prison privatization in the US and the UK. It takes more of a dialectical approach, attempting to synthesize a better prison system.

I think you should always provide a solid counter-argument to analytical papers to show how your analysis accounts for or concedes to good alternative points of view.\n https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alison_Liebling/publication/249786280_Prison_privatizationIn_search_of_a_business-like_atmosphere/links/55b9ce4308aec0e5f43c470a/Prison-privatizationIn-search-of-a-business-like-atmosphere.pdf\n\nAnother other good avenue for research would be recidivism rates in the US (look at the US Bureau of Justice Statistics). Also, don't discount reputable news articles. They're not as in-depth as books or articles, but they are more current, and can usually provide better/newer data than peer- reviewed articles.

"body":"I'll cut it short as my life story is much less interesting than many here. Born in the UK so other than the 2008 crash and its aftershocks I have no first hand experience of geopolitical disasters such as the USSR's dissolution. \n\nThe education system raised me as a fascist because I was a high achiever and deemed 'better' than the poor kids who were seen as nightmares. In my early teenage years I had left leaning sympathies but in a more fascist, authoritarian and slightly uncaring way, making me quite aligned with the BNP. But as I grew older and became more philosophical and politcally literate I nudged left in a liberal way. Once I found reddit and decided to study what I did at sixth form to get into politics at uni is when the accelerations happened. \n\nMy family had always been very poor (well, since I have been alive) for reasons almost purely of capitalism. Mother working ridiculous hours, grossly underpaid to this day, studying essentially full time while raising 3 kids. Lived in a slightly deprived area so saw the effects of being poor whilst knowing I am in a 'good' place considering many areas of the UK.\n\nMy friend was always slightly ahead in turning left, probably due to discovering the stuff on Reddit first. I basically transitioned from fascist, to social democrat once I escaped depression and started becoming more of a person with understanding of the world and the ability to think for myself and have conversations with my friend. Then the 8th May, 2015 I became a revolutionary socialist. The election showed that despite the skyrocketing poverty, nothing being offered by the economy, that issues which were almost eradicated such as hunger and homelessness were exploding, the media machine will always have an incredible hold on public opinion, because remember, 'gommunism dun work'. I fully supported Miliband, thinking his policies were exactly what people needed. Anyway...I became a revolutionary and even harder left in the space of about 30 minutes that morning. \n\nMy friend, Reddit and constant philosophical thinking led me on a path towards communism. It started with the debunking threads, progressing to reading of literature and arguments and explanations...I became a Trot, then a Stalinist, a Maoist and now an MLM. I had lived to see the experience of being poor whilst being shielded from the worst of it by the skin of my mothers teeth. I knew that the world didn't make logical sense under capitalism. History at sixth form showed me the extent to which the US has crippled the world since its inception. Reddit and literature showed me the answers to every question I didn't know to ask and showed me how I have been lied to all my life, philosophically, domestically, internationally... Everything fell into place the more I read and the more I saw over a period of years. As the 'politics kid' at my sixth form, I was debated and asked my opinion on matters all the time. This made me unable to lose an argument through sheer practice in person and using responses seen online. People would always leave saying I am absolutely right, they never thought of things this way...yet the next week they pretty much forgot because they don't really care. They hadn't lived the experience of dissatisfaction with capitalism. Raised poor, seen the workplace through the eyes of a Marxist. Listening to the everyday shit that my colleagues were dealing with 'as normal' was heartbreaking. The foundations for communism are laid by society without anyone realising, that's why they knew I was right. Some things are just common sense. Throughout school we are shown the problems facing the world. On the tv we saw the problems in our country and abroad. But it's the experiences and will to find the answers that makes people turn to communism. \n\nNow im fuckin hard left baby. Never going back. Every year I develop my beliefs or pool of knowledge even further. Despite the exhausting anger and sadness that sometimes comes with it. I have to. Because if we get anything wrong or our arguments are too few or do not pack enough punch, we will be ignored and the full extent of our movement will never be comprehended.

"body":"&gt;Capitalism is an economical system in which a relatively small class of people within the society own the means of production, whereas the majority of people own nothing but their ability to work which they then need to sell to the former group\n\nThe problem is your definition of capitalism is wrong and therefore your conclusions that follow are necessarily wrong. The first part of your definition is merely a definition of class society. It describes slavery, in which human beings and land were the means of production that an elite few owned and feudalism in which the land and tools were owned by the lord in a hierarchy going all the way up to the king who owned everything. The key element is that labor takes the form of sale, though it's not clear why it must be so from your definition. \n\n&gt;Starting by this definition, it becomes clear, that there is a necessary imbalance between the ones who own capital in some form or another and those who have nothing to offer but their physical or mental abilities.\n\nIt is also not clear why ownership of the means of production must take the form of capital specifically, and your definition is circular by using the word it is defining (capitalism is the system of capital) in its definition. This is not merely a matter of theoretical rigor but has direct political consequences:\n\n&gt;we can also see why so-called real socialism in countries like the Soviet Union was not really a successful attempt to overcome the contradictions of capitalism in order to gain more freedom for people around the world, but rather, it kept alive the imbalance of power relations that we can also find in capitalism.\n\nSince the question is one of 'power' (the imbalance between those who have and those who do not), socialism is only a repetition of capitalism, and necessarily so since an underdeveloped nation will always have imbalances in power, wealth, political consciousness, and labor. Beyond this even, since socialism is by definition a class society (in which the proletariat oppresses the bourgeoisie until its complete disappearance), your definition easily leads to utopianism, disguised as a \"critique\" of capitalism as it exists (something that made sense for Marx but makes no sense after a century of actual socialism). \n\nFor a real definition of capitalism, please read less Frankfurt school and more Marx. Capitalism is a *system* which is defined by the logic of its *mode of production,* the thing you highlight as the definition is merely a feature that manifests from that logic.","created_utc":1522167873,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

It really showed me some flaws of my definition and I would be glad to go on from there to become more precise.\n\n&gt;your definition of capitalism is wrong\n\nBut, is it really just wrong?

In contrast to systems like slavery and feudalism, where people knew that they are unfree, capitalism lives by the ideology, that it tells us, that we are free to choose any job there is. Marx, as I understand him, uncovered the fact that capitalism still doesn't make us free, but that the ties of powers are just hidden behind the ideologies of freedom, equality and justice.  \n\nFurther additions to that definition might also include the separation of labour, alienation from labour because of that and the interesting fact that we treat commodities as a relation between things (even though it is in reality a relation between human beings who produce the commodities and then buy and sell them) and that the actual relationships between human beings turn more and more reificated/ verdinglicht (like, everyone is only defined by their place in the capitalist society, their jobs, their wealth, their prestige). \nThis theory blew my mind when I read about it the first time!\n\nFeel free to offer another definition of capitalism that you think is more appropriate.

"body":"The difference between slavery (where people have nothing but their labor) and capitalism (where people have nothing but their labor) is not ideology. In fact, both the transition from slavery to capitalism and the transition from feudalism to capitalism, in which one form of labor became them other, are real historical processes in which people actively resisted becoming wage laborers and were proletarianized by force. Ideology only came later when the system was self-sustaining.\n\nThe difference is that labor power is for sale (not that human beings are for sale, which is true of slavery, but that human beings sell their capacity to labor). This means that labor has become a commodity (labor power) and that a market exists in which this commodity can be bought and sold. Capitalism, at the most broad level, is a system of general commodity production in which a class that owns the means of production extracts surplus value from a class that has nothing but its labor power in the pursuit of profit. If that sounds long, realize that Capital is a book length (really 3+ books) definition of capitalism and all parts are essential to the system as a whole. \n\nFrom there, you can look at different aspects of the totality to emphasize different temporal and spatial moments in the process and how they connect to other aspects dialectically. One of the many strengths of this analysis is that it allows one to see how one aspect of the process can create the seed for the system as whole (Marx points out how markets create the relations of capitalism out of their very nature in his critique of Proudhon for example, something still very relevant today when socialist countries have been forced to retreat from total planning and are attempting to harness the forces of markets).\n\nYou can imagine that socialism attempted to address all of these aspects but ended up emphasizing some over others because of reality with the goal of eventually eliminating them all.\n\nYou're right in a sense that your definition is both too broad and too narrow. But as I also pointed out, it is not merely a matter of factuality. Your definition is *ideological,* meaning that it emphasizes a particular aspect of class society in order to make a political point: a petty-bourgeois critique of socialism. It is actually worse than \"wrong,\" it is reactionary.

"body":"I've been going through a bit of a similar journey as you, and I've subscribed to a bunch of different subreddits to get exposure to various political ideologies. \n\nI agree with you that wealth inequality is the root cause of many of the the USA's issues. Most people spend their entire lives in roughly the same economic class that they're born into, so the American Libertarian idea that personal and economic freedom afford everyone the same opportunities just doesn't hold up, in my mind. \n\nHowever, I still think that wealth/money/status is a strong motivator for a significant number of people and one of the core drivers of innovation in the world. Admittedly, part of that is probably just the the product of our capitalist society, but I think a lot of it is an innate part of human nature. So I don't think that ALL inequality is bad, just when it gets too extreme. \n\nI also believe that, in most cases, it's more efficient for smaller groups of people or individuals to make their own financial decisions, so I'm not a huge fan of the idea of government programs deciding how to spend the redistributed wealth, particularly at the federal level. You can see evidence of this in low income countries where some charities are shifting from providing specific goods/services to just pumping a little bit of money into those areas (often through micro-lending), and allowing the people to decide how to spend it on their best interests. \n\nSo, at the moment, I'm gravitating towards the idea of a society that's largely based on current capitalist ideas but also incorporates socialist concepts such as universal healthcare, universal basic income, free or heavily subsidized college education, higher estate tax and highly progressive tax brackets. I think a system built on these combined concepts would: \n\n1. keep people motivated to work hard and continue driving innovation, and retain the efficiencies of the free market (through keeping the basic economy around capitalism, allowing some amount of inequality, and providing UBI over many social programs),\n2. help level the playing field for young people entering the \"real world\" (though affordable education, UBI, and estate taxes), \n3. provide for those who are unable to work (through UBI and universal healthcare), \n4. make it easier for people to pursue less-profitable careers such as the arts, academia, teaching, or charity work (through affordable education, UBI, and universal healthcare), \n5. allow for greater employee welfare since employers would have to provide more benefits/better working conditions to attract employees (through UBI and universal healthcare),\n6. discourage individuals from becoming ultra-rich, which would leave more of the market available for new innovators to come in and make a name for themselves as well as help cut down on political corruption caused by certain individuals having too much economic power (through highly progressive tax brackets and higher estate taxes). \n\nSo far, \"social democracy\" is the best term that I've found that incorporates these ideas, though if someone know of a better fit, please let me know. And honestly, now that I type it out, it sounds more and more like a lot of western Europe and Scandinavia, though perhaps with more individual financial autonomy through UBI rather than specific social programs.\n\nThat's said, this has all been a very recent development and I haven't spent as much time considering/researching the downsides of such a society as I have the advantages. And then, of course, there's the challenge of actually getting people to vote in a way that would implement it correctly and avoid corruption, though I guess that's a challenge of any ideological shift.

"body":"do not want so start a polemic here but just two points you might find interesting (or so I hope). First thing the idea that 'wealth/money/status is a strong motivator for a significant number of people and one of the core drivers of innovation in the world.' Take the iphone to start with; GPS, wi-fi, the internet (!), the mobile network, even touch screens, are the result or public funded research. The reason is simple, and Friedman is here to help, the first commandment of an enterprise is to make profit, they manage, they hardly innovate, or what they call innovation is but competitive advantage. R&amp;D is bound for profit, not to follow the possible intuition of some bright guy. More so if competition gets tougher. That is true for computers, satellites, airplanes, and I could go on. So my point is be careful of cheap propaganda. People like Hawking, Einstein or Turing would have done it for money? To compete with one another? no. As silicon valley man Thiel says, competition is for losers. \n\nSecond 'pumping a little bit of money into those areas (often through micro-lending), and allowing the people to decide how to spend it on their best interests.' This is an idea given for dead from the world bank already a few years back. It was indeed propaganda since the very beginning - supply side that is. I paste a bit of a 2015 article from the Guardian, but many more come to the same conclusion: 'David Roodman from the Center for Global Development put it in his recent book, \u201cThe best estimate of the average impact of microcredit on the poverty of clients is zero.\u201d [\u2026] In fact, it turns out that microfinance usually ends up making poverty worse. The reasons for this are fairly simple. Most microfinance loans are used to fund consumption \u2013 to help people buy the basic necessities they need to survive. In South Africa, for example, consumption accounts for 94% of microfinance use.  As a result, borrowers don\u2019t generate any new income that they can use to repay their loans so they end up taking out new loans to repay the old ones, wrapping themselves in layers of debt. When micro-loans are used to fund new businesses, budding entrepreneurs tend to encounter a lack of consumer demand. After all, their potential customers are poor and low on cash, and what little money they do have gets spent on basic goods that tend already to be available. The worst \u2013 and much more likely \u2013 is that the new businesses fail, which then leads, once again, to vicious cycles of over-indebtedness that drive borrowers even further into poverty. This demand-side problem can be stated quite simply: poor people don\u2019t have enough money. Apparently we need expensive research studies to point this out.'\n\n","created_utc":1522183587,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

I disagree that they turn it to a more idealistic theory (if that is actually what you mean, but epistemological break sounds like that).\nFor me, it is rather an extension to Marxist theory: They show, how capitalistic logic spreads into all areas of life, how alienation grows in times of world wide capitalism. At the same time, the core of their theory as I understand it, is always and just like with Marx the actual material conditions of people and the relations in which we produce commodities in a society. What makes them interesting to me, is that they go one step further and show, via psychoanalysis, what happens to a society in which people are disappointed with the existing system and how that can lead to fascism in the end (this is just a really really short overview of the marking points).\n\nAnd for the latter, some of the aspects that differ from Marx, I could understand why the Frankfurt School does it. Why should I go back to Marx and in which aspects you think?\n\nIn my opinion, the biggest difference between them at face value is maybe the hope in actual change (like, Marx seems to believe in the eventual historical moment in which the synthesis will come and we will no longer be stuck within the antithesis. Frankfurt School, especially Adorno, seem to be more sceptical if this outcome will ever happen.

"body":"How are the conditions different than the BPP era? How are they the same? The occupation of black communities by the police is the same (and has actually gotten worse once you realize the prison system is a mass system of concentration camps for the black American population) and I would imagine similar tactics could work. The proletariat has changed however: cities have been abandoned; wealth has retreated to the suburbs; centers of finance link each other in a global system of imperialism with the actual black urban population left to rot. The common link to a occupied 'black belt' is still there but more distant and would be harder to organize around. On the other hand the occupied nature of what used to be Mexico is clearer than ever as Latino immigrant labor has become the foundation of the American parasitic settler nation. The global movement for decolonization is gone as is the cultural revolution, but on the other hand capitalism is in a deep crisis with no immediate way out: the same demands for self-empowerment and democracy that led to the bottom-up aspect of neoliberal ideology would be impossible demands for a dying capitalism. Overall, I don't think the current situation is all that much worse once you realize most of what seemed like radicalism in the 60s and 70s in the USA was really nothing of the sort and has been cast in that light for political purposes. \n\nAs for the BPP itself, it's clear that the inability to survive the Cleaver/Newton/Seale split (the ultra-left, proletarian line, and right) was the causal element. There was no long march for the BPP nor did Newton survive as Lenin did in exile and in isolation from the majority faction. Bizarrely, the rightist line is the one that has survived among the left (with an emphasis on \"serve the people programs\" among Maoists, focusing on electoral politics among others, and identity politics in general) since the ultra-leftist line rose and fell in the late 70s. Why was that the case? I suspect it's because of the changes I mentioned. The very class base of the BPP was pulled out from under it as black people were abandoned for a global proletariat, though of course in the short term it was the political repression and sectarianism that killed the party as well as many other reasons (the difference between the formal leadership of Newton and his actual influence behind bars which became a serious problem after his release, the inability of the BPP to link with working class organizations like the LRBW, the inability of the organization to handle such rapid growth at a basic bureaucratic level, etc.) But had the underlying conditions of the time remained, I could imagine David Hilliard or someone else serving as the Lenin of the movement when revolutionary conditions intensified again. \n\nWhile organizing a BPP-like organization is much more difficult, capitalism is much more parasitic. The US largely fought the Vietnam war to prevent a socialist Vietnam from developing; now the proletariat itself is in Vietnam. Anything you can do to prevent war, imperialism, and racism is necessary so the Vietnamese can act. Organizations here probably won't reach BPP size until something major changes (though the DSA is a lot like the SDS) but imagine if the BPP had decades of organizing experience and good cadre instead of coming out of nothing and returning to nothing. The most important thing for me is to build good organizations. I don't think the material conditions are all that different in the Philippines and Indonesia but look at the difference in politics. The \"revisionist\" Greek communist party survived and self-criticized while the Italian communist party liquidated and is now nothing. The conditions aren't all that different but in the latter the working class is forced to support a comedian while organizations on the streets of Greece and anti-fascism are controlled by the proletariat. Easier said than done since organizations eat themselves during non-revolutionary times but we should try anyway. I guess implicit in this is the idea that revisionism is not only an inevitable consequence of class struggle in the party but that it can be overcome. Cuba is the most interesting example of a move to the left in the 80s which may have saved the party and the country from complete collapse. This also implies that \"revisionist\" countries are far preferable to capitalist ones, though defending them should obviously not be the main use of your time.","created_utc":1522194275,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

It makes sense because the social fabric of a capitalist society falls apart and degrades during an imperial war.

The first forms of money were credit. \n\n\n&gt; Do you think reading Karl Marx is the best way to learn what the ideals of pure communism are\n\n\nIf you want to know how capitalism works, and how it emerged out of fuedalism, then Marx *has* to be on your reading list. \n\n\n&gt; what are the major differences between Marxism, Maoism, Leninism, and communism.\n\n\nMarxism is before all other things a critical analyses of capitalism and class society, and it's development over time. \n\n\nMarxism-Leninism and Marxism-Leninism-Maoism are similar in that they argue for a vanguard party to lead the proletariat, but differ slightly in how best to protect the revolution during the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. Someone more informed than me can dig into the minutae, as I don't really care about that stuff. \n\n\nCommunism in it's most broad sense is the real movement of the working class to emancipate itself from capital, in it's most narrow sense it is a hypothetical future global stateless, classless, moneyless society. \n\n\n&gt; Is there a significant difference between communism and Anarcho-communism?\n\n\nAnarcho-communists share the notion with communists of the need to \"smash\" the \"ready-made state machinery,\" but differ in what should replace that. Communists argue for a proletatian state to reconstitute society so to negate the conditions that give rise to private property and capital, and thus class. Anarcho-communists are Anarchists who advocate the complete abolition of the state. \n\n\n&gt; Is it fair to say that pure capitalism is necessarily stateless? \n\n\nThere is no such thing as \"pure capitalism,\" it simply *is*. Where private property and wage relations, commodity production and exchange, and capital accumulation exists so too does capitalism. Arguments of whether a country is \"more\" or \"less\" capitalist are idealogical value judgments. \n\n\nAnticapitalists of the varying stripes (generally) view the state as the special force for the suppression of a particular class. In the Marxist view the state emerges from the irreconcilability of class antagonisms, \n\n\n&gt; The state is, therefore, by no means a power forced on society from without; just as little is it \u2019the reality of the ethical idea\u2019, \u2019the image and reality of reason\u2019, as Hegel maintains. Rather, it is a product of society at a certain stage of development; it is the admission that this society has become entangled in an insoluble contradiction with itself, that it has split into irreconcilable antagonisms which it is powerless to dispel. But in order that these antagonisms, these classes with conflicting economic interests, might not consume themselves and society in fruitless struggle, it became necessary to have a power, seemingly standing above society, that would alleviate the conflict and keep it within the bounds of \u2019order\u2019; and this power, arisen out of society but placing itself above it, and alienating itself more and more from it, is the state.\n\n\n--Frederick Engels, [The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm) \n\n\nFrom this we can understand that capitalism *cannot* exist without a state, without a special force for the suppression of a particular class, of the proletariat. The capitalists require this \"special force\" to establish an \"orderly society\" conducive to commercial production and exchange; to arbitrate between the conflicting factions of capital; to offload the externalities of basic research, infrastructure building, education, and bailing out the capitalists; and a state military machine to expand and protect markets. \n\n\n&gt; Is it fair to say that pure communism is necessarily stateless?\n\n\nThere is no such thing as \"pure communism.\" There is the real movement of the working class to emancipate itself from capital. Everywhere and all the time this movement is shaped by material circumstances and the extent to which the proletariat is organized *against* capital, or alternatively, organized *for* labor. \n\n\n&gt; As far as I can tell the nitty gritty (so to speak) of Capitalism is the argument for equality of opportunity, and the likewise for Communism is equality of outcome.\n\n\nIn my view these are platitudes that tell us more about the person uttering them than anything about the world *as it exists*. The only \"argument\" that capitalism really has is reproducing capital, full stop. The only \"argument\" that communism really has is for the great mass of people to emancipate *themselves* from that paradigm. \n\n\n&gt; Anarcho_Capitalism is seemingly less restrictive in what it allows you as an individual to do.\n\n\nNo. It is *more restrictive* because it requires all human thought and action to be filtered through the prism of commercial production and exchange. That is not freedom, that is the reproduction of capital to generate surplus-value for property owners at the expense of the producers of value, of the proletariat. \n\n\n\"Anarcho-capitalists\" are either confused, misled, misguided, or outright deceitful. Convenient cover for truly abhorrent views. \n\n\n&gt; Does true anarchism lean capitalist or communist?\n\n\n\"True Anarchism\" is the abolition of all dominance hierarchies, full stop. \"Anarcho-capitalists\" cannot be considered \"anarchist\" because they support the dominance hierarchies between employer/employee, landlord/tenant, and creditor/debtor. Anarchists and Communists alike seek to dismantle these social relationships and replace them with those premised on free association, egalitarianism, and direct participation. \n\n\n&gt; If just one group of people bands together and disobeys the NAP, all they have to do is start invading lands and suddenly there goes Ancapistan. \n\n\nThe NAP is nonsense and no matter what the charlatans say would require a state or state-like entity to enforce. As class would still be a thing under their preferred paradigm, even assuming an \"anarcho-capitalist revolution\" which \"smashes\" the state it will simply re-emerge because they have no desire to negate the premises that give rise to class, which therefore gives rise to the state. This is the eventuality of any \"anarcho-capitalist\" society; warlords fighting each other for cheap land, raw materials, and slave labor. \n\n\n&gt; Please define what fascism is in your opinion.\n\n\nFascism is the iron gauntlet of Liberalism. It emerges as reaction to heavily suppress proletatian movements (even moreso than under \"ideal\" circumstances) to maintain capital reproduction. It is the marriage of private capital and state power to stamp out revolutionary movements.\n\n\n&gt; Assuming no force is ever present, an Anarcho-capitalism society would allow for a communist society to exist within it,\n\n\nNo it would not. An \"Anarcho-capitalist\" society would stamp out revolutionary movements even more vehemently than even Liberal states do. \n\n\n&gt; but an Anarcho_Communist society would not allow for an Anarcho_Capitalist society to exist (since Proletariat&gt; Bourgeoisie)\n\n\nYes. The difference being under \"Anarcho-capitalism\" a privileged minority class would use the \"ready-made state machinery\" to suppress the proletariat, whereas under a Dictatorship of the Proletatiat the great mass of people would suppress the Bourgeoisie. \n\n\n&gt; The Commune, therefore, appears to have replaced the smashed state machine \u201conly\u201d by fuller democracy: abolition of the standing army; all officials to be elected and subject to recall. But as a matter of fact this \u201conly\u201d signifies a gigantic replacement of certain institutions by other institutions of a fundamentally different type. This is exactly a case of \"quantity being transformed into quality\": democracy, introduced as fully and consistently as is at all conceivable, is transformed from bourgeois into proletarian democracy; from the state (= a special force for the suppression of a particular class) into something which is no longer the state proper.\n\n\n--V.I. Lenin, State and Revolution, Chapter III: The Experience of the Paris Commune of 1871, [What is to Replace the Smashed State Machinery?](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch03.htm#s2) \n\n\n&gt; In a stateless communist society what would happen if the commune were met with force? Does communism assume that the ruling class will always and forever be proletariat, and therefor no one would challenge it since everyone everywhere would be proletariat? Basically, what negates force for you guys like the NAP negates force for the anarcho-capitalists?\n\n\nThe \"NAP\" does not \"negate\" force, it just calls it something else to justify the force required to establish and protect property rights. \n\n\nThe first thing a proletarian revolution must do upon \"smashing\" the \"ready-made state machinery\" is to disband the standing army and arm the proletariat. Therefore, should they be met by some outside force the great mass of people would defend themselves. \n\n","created_utc":1522240248,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

"body":"&gt; Is it fair to say that Fascism=Capitalism=Statism *because* (in your view)\n\n\nNo. Capitalism is a mode of production characterized by private property and wage relations, commodity production and exchange, and capital accumulation. A fascist society is capitalist, but a capitalist society is not necessarily fascist. Statism is not unique to either, but merely a component. \n\n\nLiberalism is the justifying ideology of capitalism and the state, and Fascism is the reactionary response to proletatian movements of emancipation. This can be characterized by a marriage between private capital and state power, hypermilitarism, racism and chauvinism, and appeals to a \"glorious past\" that must be returned to. \n\n\n&gt; Capitalism needs the state in order for it to to exist\n\n\nMore that the state emerges as a consequence of the irreconcilable antagonisms between the classes. \n\n\n&gt; and the state is oppressive when it does not implement communist values\n\n\nThe state is oppressive by virtue of it's existence, the differences emerge in how the state is organized, who it is composed of, how it makes decisions, and how it carries out those decisions.

However -- to play the devil's advocate for a moment -- he could just be gathering information/debating/networking, instead of agreeing with their political movement. \n\n&gt;https://imgur.com/a/86Cvh\n\n@The first two images: I agree that he expresses some..

I'd just say his analysis is incorrect, not harmful, unless I missed something of course (which is entirely possible since I don't know that much about NazBols). Aditionally, a series of short messages is not exactly the ideal way of communicating political analysis. \n\n@The third image: As I interpret him, Caleb is simply saying that the American liberal left lost the elections because they focused on liberal 'identity politics' instead of class issues. A similar opinion has been expressed by Slavoj Zizek, and I tend to agree with this assessment.

"body":"I was born in independent Ukraine, but my parents was living and raised there, as a lot of my relatives. All of them claims that despite people was unable to buy a lot of stuff, nobody was scared of poverty, criminals or oppression. One of the most important things back then was buildup of true morality in people with all sort of instruments: from films and literature to public shame. Also, a lot of scientists that researched people happiness revealed that one of the most important things in people's life was feeling of connection to community - the same reason why subcultures and cults are born. And almost everyone felt like they are part of greater things than just some new form of governement - of course propaganda makes it dirty work, but hey! Almost everyone  who lived there knew, that they are not just some citizens, but offspring of people who fought for their own freedom with blood and will. This feeling of connection to one of the greatest examples of human will is what driving people together. But the mistakes in public education have driven that system to the brink of extinction, mostly because of the people who have never had any morality from  the start. Also, as my own research showed, the vote for ukranian independence from ussr was falsified...

The question was what to do about it. Unions were in favor of change, in this there can be no doubt, but they were against any change that was anti-democratic. Yet, the world was not composed only of bomb-throwers and non-bomb-throwers; there were many gradations and subtle variations; there were people whose attitudes and outlooks were hard to characterize and impossible to label.

"body":"To answer the question you have to know what the question means. Seems self-evident but is actually quite complex. What is socialism? What is the justification of the Vietnamese communist party for the reforms and do they make sense? What does empirical reality tell us? What is the structure of capitalism today and what does it mean for Vietnam?\n\nThe problem is people live in reality. Scientists start out by defining their terms, doing experiments, educating themselves, and narrowing their focus. When a chemist says \"I have no opinion on genetic drift, it's not my field\" it doesn't surprise anyone. But when your subject of study is politics and history in the present, you're driven to find complete answers immediately so you can change the world for the better. That's not wrong, in fact Marx calls for it. But it's been combined with the social isolation and class decay of first world leftists to create a desperate situation. In the past, the party was the organ of scientific study while militants were those who changed the world. Praxis guided not only knowledge but what kind of questions you were asking in the first place.\n\nAll of that has been lost for many young people on the internet, who instead are trying to cobble together the knowledge of an entire party in praxis through internet discussion and social media. The question you're asking is a very difficult one, I admit my knowledge of Vietnam is not sufficient to have an informed opinion. Instead, you're desperately searching for knowledge in all the wrong places which allows liberals (on the left and right) to prey on that desire with answers easily absorbed into liberal ideology. \n\nIf you join a party and they tell you the party line on Vietnam and you don't believe it, why do you think that is? We'd like to think it's because we want to seek truth ourselves but that's not really true, most people don't know anything at all. The real answer is because it doesn't relate to your praxis so it has no real meaning. In the 70s the socialist nature of Vietnam was obvious to everyone on the left because it was directly relevant to leftism in the West. Now it's a rare thing to say and is almost always qualified. That's not because the facts changed, it's because the material conditions changed which changed ideology which changed how facts are perceived and organized in consciousness. I became a leftist originally because encountering people with opinions radically different than my own made me see the ideology behind what I believed and how little facts actually mattered to it. Those people were being ironic, one of the pathologies of the moment we find ourselves in, but the ideological break was real. \n\nWestern petty-bourgeois are trained from day one to see knowledge as the means of advancement for their class. This has happened while the education system has collapsed in arguably the worst attack on knowledge in general since the counter-reformation. Wikipedia has taken the place of the latter while social media has become the site of the last vestige of the former's possibilities. We have to admit that the way we seek knowledge in general is flawed and no longer corresponds to material reality. It only makes us prey to the escapism of parasitic internet primitive accumulation which makes us do labor for free as the real economy devours itself (like I am doing now). Join a party, see where it takes you, and see how the proletariat thinks because they do not have a voice on the internet.

Marxism is the last and most logical step in the European science tradition, it is what I adhere to. But there are many non-westerners who don't believe in western science.

The natives distributed wealth not because they wanted something in return; that was their way of life. Free of incentives, free of rationalization and free of ego. That is perfectly fine with me, all natives that fight for their right to self-determination are revolutionaries in my eyes. Regardless if they practice the European material science that Marx developed or not, after all their system before the colonists arrived was one of love, respect and true equality for ALL life not just people but even animals and this planet. It was the colonial Europeans who destroyed the world that is why Marx created this material science to address it. There were several colored revolutionaries and anti-imperialists even before Marx as well as after. As communists our fight is not only against capitalist, but it is against white supremacy, sexism, Eurocentrism, and against all colonial/imperial powers.

"body":"&gt; China\u2019s alliance with the PLO dates back to the mid-1960s, when Beijing suspended its unofficial diplomatic relations with Israel and expressed its support for Palestinian self-determination. In 1965, Mao Zedong told members of a PLO delegation visiting China that Israel was a \u201cbase of imperialism in Asia.\u201d To defeat \u201cAmerican imperialism,\u201d Mao encouraged Palestinian nationalists to engage in armed struggle.\n\n&gt; Initially, PLO supporters did not embrace Mao\u2019s rhetoric. The PLO\u2019s founding leader, Ahmad Shukeiri disdained the Chinese communist system. According to Hebrew University of Jerusalem Professor Yitzshak Shichor, the PLO leadership wanted to focus on revolutionary training and indoctrination rather than armed struggle.\n\n&gt; Beijing\u2019s staunch support for the Palestinian cause also strained China\u2019s relations with the Arab world. Many anti-communist Arab leaders believed that China\u2019s support for the PLO was part of Beijing\u2019s broader objective of competing with the United States and USSR for hegemony in the Middle East.\n\n&gt; During the 1970s, Palestinian nationalists supported Maoist revolutionary ideology in greater numbers and PLO leader Yasser Arafat accepted military support from Beijing. China established a PLO embassy in Beijing in 1974 and strongly supported a 1975 United Nations (UN) resolution equating Zionism with racism. After a decade-long hiatus in diplomatic relations under Deng Xiaoping, China reaffirmed its commitment to the Palestinian cause by diplomatically recognizing the self-declared independent state of Palestine in 1988.","created_utc":1522365346,"score":11,"subreddit":"communism"}

I think we should judge by them by their fruits. Identities are worth nothing in isolation.

"body":"Well if you are white yes it does change a lot. It can be perceived as you perpetuating a colonial and white privileged mindset. Subcommandante Marcos was possibly the only one on this list who really wasn't communist, the others were or had strong socialist leanings. Either way all of them created real material change in our world and affected history in a big way that is not stated. That is why they are on the list. Most of them fought western imperialism and colonialism within and outside of their country. I come onto this site as well as other marxist forums and see nothing but discussion of white communists. That is fine, but as you point out there are \"As of 2017 there are several million communists in India\" when are we ever talking about these million communists? When are we ever putting faces to names? I look at the side bar it's all white men besides Mao, I look at the flairs it's all white people besides Mao and Ho Chi Minh. Again that is all fine but growing up as a brown pakistani in Amerikkka I was robbed of representation and identity. All I want is to be represented in the one community that advocates for my rights. You throw nothing but statistics and numbers at me. Where is the cultural representation? Primarily in first world Marxist spaces? It is nothing but european figures and some asian but never south asian figures. Never a face to put to the name. If you are white the question I asked really matters because you never had to think about a topic like this because you never lacked representation. You don't know what it feels like to be a ghost. Almost all of these people accomplished something that has changed history for the better. Subcommandante probably accomplished the least, politically speaking in this list. Also when did I say don't support other third world revolutionaries? Help with this list instead of tearing it down since your so keen on the entire list being hardcore communists. If you can find a list of hardcore communists from south Asia and the middle east then why are you withholding the information? Share the knowledge with us because we clearly want to learn. Respect to Claudia Jones I will add her to the list. But other communists I have on this list are just as important as her. \"Well, why should celebrate these and not others?\" Because we are communists who believe in material change. Aside from Subcommandante Marcos every revolutionary I stated has made some type of material change that is worth speaking on as communists. You are the one who says we should speak about their \"fruits\" so yes that is exactly what I am doing. Do you want me to list 50 Indian hardcore maoists who weren't able to accomplish much materially? What purpose does that serve? Instead I am listening communists, socialists and left wing anti imperialist revolutionaries who crushed western imperial powers such as the British, French, Spanish, Dutch, etc and fought for the freedom of their people. \"There will always be \"John Brown\" types in oppressor nations and \"Frederick Engels\" types from the oppressing classes.\" - Yes I have no problem with that and that is usually the only type of people we talk about as communists, what about the opposite? \"And of course, there will always be charlatans, careerists, sellouts, and traitors amongst the oppressed.\" - yes that is true but we never talk about the heros, revolutionaries, anti imperialists from the colonized and third world (specifically middle east, north africa, and south asia) which is what this post is addressing. Also your name suggests you are a supporter of \"Juche\" which many communists would argue is not marxist and a separate line of thinking. I personally advocate for it but your words are hypocritical if you don't support other types of revolutionaries yet here you are supporting Juche. Doesn't make much sense and you are contradicting yourself. \n\nOn a side note, I don't think Subcommandante Marcos ever wanted to lead a revolution, he merely wanted to fight for native rights.  Again to make that critism of my list based on one non marxist that was included is unfair. Almost everyone on my list was a marxist and left wing who made a significant dent in history yet was wiped out and forgotten. Do you know about Abd el-Krim? Do you know about his sucessful victories against major imperialist forces? Do you know that Mao Zedong and Che were both influenced by him? Do you know about Hadj-Ali Abelkader? Do you know that he was kicked out of the French Communist party for his views being so radical? He came from a colony of France to France and they did not support his radical anti colonist views. Who knows about Hadj-Ali Abelkader and his achievements and accomplishments? I wonder why this is, he was clearly erased out of the narrative. To deny that race and identity plays no part in one's psyche is denying the effects of colonization and white supremacy which are fundamental components of capitalism. Thus in a sense you are denying the oppressed of identity which makes no sense when you follow an ideology that fights for the oppressed. I am igniting revolutionary thought and action for the oppressed and colonized, your ideas serve no value or reason to the oppressed and colonized. I'm focused on making material change, not debating the specifics of ideologies of revolutionaries who made a great impact in society. Your rhetoric serves little to zero purpose for the oppressed. Like I said almost everyone on this list has major \"fruits\" as you say, they have accomplished a lot materially and were still forgotten. Take Bhashani for example, or even Abd El-Krim. How much can you tell me about these people? They created a real material change and still were forgotten. Like I said since you are keen on tearing this list down then provide your own list of hardcore communists since majority of them come from third world countries in your own quotes. You can make your own list which would be much more productive than tearing mine down over one non-marxist. Just look at the responses of other black and brown communists and stop trying so hard to deny our reality and identity. You clearly don't understand the effects that colonization and white supremacy has on the psyche. Part of the reason why is because you don't truly know some of these important black and brown communists such as Frantz Fanon  who wrote extensively on the topic of colonizations effect on psyche and identity/race. I will gladly take Subcomandante Marcos off this list if it bothers you, because I believe everyone else on this list deserves to stay there and made a material change worth speaking about. Also re-read the list I have added much more radical communists who are also brown and black to the list. I can count a total of possibly 2 figures out of the dozens I posted who might not be radical communists. If you really think these 2 negatively impact the list I will remove them, because the rest deserve to be there. ","created_utc":1522381307,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

The issue is that it's written in various styles, almost as though sections were written by different people.\n\nThis is probably one of the more challenging works in the Marxist canon, and possibly one of the most rewarding ones. It's definitely worth tackling, as it provides the theoretical framework underlying Marxism. It's tough, but I urge people to read it however they can, even if alongside guides, like the one by the much maligned David Harvey, or alternatively Heinrich's introduction.

"body":"*Capital* has been very good to me thus far (just got to part IV today).\n\nMarx really elaborates on theoretical concepts in the beginning, and never hesitates to use dialectical analysis on pretty much every subject matter in the book. If you don't mind highlighting and writing in the book (which I strongly suggest any reader do), I suggest highlighting any time he refers to a dualistic character of a subject. \n\nInitially it seems like the concepts are very abstract, but once he plugs them in to real world examples it helps solidify the ideas. To anyone struggling with this book initially, just get passed the first 3 chapters and it's smooth sailing from there. \n\nIn part 1, Marx sets up his analysis beginning with the commodity and its dualistic character, then proceeds to explain that you can exchange commodities, and builds off of this by arriving at the universal equivalent of money. It's in chapter 3 where the materiality of his analysis begins to flourish, and certain power imbalances are inferred, as well as crises that stem from superfluous token money are introduced. \n\nPart 2 is much more straight forward and feels like Marx could settle in and focus on particular parts on capitalist production. In this part we're introduced to the transformation of the  C-M-C commodity circulation in to its true form, M-C-M', that is, buying for the sake of creating more value. It's in this part of the book that he introduces surplus value, which to my surprise actually meant \"to put in less value in to production and circulation than you withdraw from it\". Here he starts talking about how capital is a process rather than a static object, and begins to discuss the buying and selling of labor value (and as such, the commodification of labor. As he states previously, anything can be commodified under capitalist production).\n\nPart 3 he talks more about *how* you arrive at M' (in the M-C-M' relationship, M' = more money than you originally started with).  Marx introduced constant capital (mop) and variable capital (labor)  and delves in to certain equations of capital which utilize constant capital, variable capital, and surplus value which will be further expanded upon later. \n\nChapter 10, probably my favorite chapter thus far, delves in to the working day. Here he explains that surplus value is created by labor time that a worker puts in to production that is not spent on his subsistence as a worker. This leads us in to many historical/political ongoings of the 1800s as to the oppressive relationship between Capitalist and worker, and here we can plainly see in historical context the diametrically opposed class interests of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. In the next chapter, Marx discusses an elaboration on the previous capital formula and arrives at a formula for the Mass of Surplus Value. He discusses material limitations for capital, which I have no doubt he will elaborate in the further reading. Here Marx also introduced the hegelian concept of quantitative change directly leading in to qualitative change, which is quite exciting as I had just finished reading the conclusions of Lenin's \"Development of Capitalism in Russia\" in which he plainly illustrated the quantitative to qualitative changes from the development of the means of production.  \n\nSadly that's all I've read thus far. In my opinion, the difficulty of this text is fairly high due to me having to constantly reread, get out pens and highlighters, take notes, etc., but perhaps to someone more educated with advanced reading it would be easier. Still, I'll put this one at a 4/5 in terms of difficulty, especially in the beginning. \n\nThis entire book has been a journey and it's something that you can plainly observe in your every day life, and I'm sure that people of different experiences will all take something extra from the book. Capital is something I'm hesitant at recommending to complete newcomers of communism or anticapitalsim due to its depth, but nevertheless in my eyes it remains a staple and is something I believe everyone should study in their life time.

"body":"I completely agree with this, and I see what you mean by it feeling like it's written by multiple authors. I think it could also be a strategic thing, in that Marxism in of itself is a proletarian ideology but it was written by bourgeois intelligentsia. This is an inherit contradiction in lower-class academia, and I feel like Marx seeks to alleviate that by tackling concepts from different angles. \n\nHe takes the approach of statistical analysis, and of speaking of myths and stories (cyclops, vampires, werewolves). He personifies capital in to a process, and it can be extraordinary colorful. Usually in the dry parts, I feel like they become dry not because they lack substance, but simply because I catch him rambling on and on (that's where my highlighter comes in handy). I find it especially important in this text to find the main points of a paragraph and understand when a following paragraph is simply an elaboration, or when it's leading in to something bigger. \n\nI find he repeats himself so much that it feels like he \"holds your hand\" while throwing you in to the depths of Lake Baikal. Eventually you'll find that sentence like a diamond in a rough that makes you go \"a-ha!\" and you need to highlight it or write a note or else it will get lost in the sea of words he creates. \n\nI had read smaller works by Marx before tackling this, and talked with Marxists which really helped me see where he was going.

The State and Revolution is perhaps the perfect book to expose them to given the material\u2019s stance on the state. I assume your parents ideologically enjoy the idea of a small state, the book gives a roadmap to dissolving it altogether! \n\nThere\u2019s no reason to be afraid or concerned if you\u2019ve prepared yourself for the confrontation.

"body":"To be a communist is to be forthright in what you do and say, but in this case, I feel you may be in danger if you are rebellious to a large degree, so with that being said, I suggest keeping a low profile when it comes to politics around them. Look, parents by their very nature in this society are typically reactionary, so I doubt they'd be easy on you if you go right out and start getting into revolution and all that with them.\n\nIf you really want to discuss that\u2014revolution, communism, history, and all that\u2014I'd say wait several years, like after you've moved out and are wholly independent of them and all. You wanna be self-sufficient afore you anger them, lol. That's paramount because parents have been known to kick out LGBT kids, kids who are irreligious, kids who even simply disagree with them, and they've definitely kicked out kids because of their political views. This is a symptom I suppose of narcissistic and controlling parents, a problem in this society.\n\nLegally they can't kick you out, but they can do shit that is worse than kicking you out, because if you're old enough to be kicked out and if they do that, well at least you have a place to get away from them at\u2014even if it means being homeless\u2014but if you're stuck at home and can't legally leave, you're stuck there, and you probably don't want that! They can kick you around, mock you, put you down, insult you, and much more, maybe even get physical, and in my view, that's somewhat worse than being out on the streets for a few years.\n\nI have to deal with the same shit, believe me, and while my controlling and narcissistic parents haven't totally fucked me over, they've definitely tried. My biggest mistake was being too open about what I believe, buying tons of communist books\u2014having them right out in the open. I've also said things they find to be outright troubling, such as my opposition to the police and their crimes. Even when they call out the police for shooting unarmed people in the streets, the minute I say, well maybe all police are supposed to do this, they get angry and say I'm on a bad road\u2014they say I'm scary. Complete bullshit, it is, but that's how parents are. Don't make these errors, don't be so talkative about politics, not at your age, and not there, it becomes too obvious.\n\nIf you can, try reading on an electronic device for now.

"body":"Yes identities such as brown and black won\u2019t matter after full communism is achieved correct. But currently they matter as much as they ever did due to the system of white supremacy and oppression against the colonized still being in place if not stronger than it ever was. Until these systems are fully destroyed, it is important the oppressed and colonized people of the world see their self worth, see the work that people that look similar to them have done. Currently, making brown and black identities \u201cobsolete\u201d would only delay inevitable revolution and will keep the oppressed classes ignorant and in place. All these revolutionaries and prophets that I have listed kept their identities in tact if not encouraged identity as a vital part of their revolutionary tactics. They were able to rally the masses in their respective communities not only be identity but by realizing identity is a huge reason of why they were being oppressed. Therefore; they were able to create mass movements of the oppressed which is the single greatest threat not only to white supremacy, colonization/neo-colonization, imperialism but system of capitalism and all forms of oppression that it operates on. As the BPP said, the vanguard of the revolution should and must be the oppressed &amp; colonized of the world. Without that vanguard a true revolution that erases all forms of hierarchy will never be achieved. Therefore we should all recognize that all forms of identity have been used to separate,  but that is a material reality of the world perpetuated through capitalism and white supremacy. It is a material reality all must acknowledge and fight against. Some have been oppressed solely based on their material identity and identity (only for those who\u2019s identity is oppressed and suppressed under the systems of capitalism) must be used in order inevitably destroy all forms of oppression. By denying identity while forms of oppression are still in place, one could essentially be denying the effects of colonization, white supremacy, and imperialism.

"body":"Thanks for that information. I love corny action movies from the 1980s and the plot reminds me of one of those.\n\nI must point out, however, that an \"ideologically committed communist party\" in no way guarantees a particular social system. In the first place, even if we grant that they are \"ideologically committed\", it doesn't mean that their ideology is necessarily proletarian. In the second place, we know that sincere communists can oversee the dissolution of socialism -- see USSR -- or even oversee a utter \"failure to launch\" as a ruling party -- see the Communist Party of South Africa. \n\nOf course, it is also arguable whether the majority of the party are truly \"ideologically committed\". I mean, Xi's whole campaign for rooting out corruption basically admits that there is a crisis of legitimacy on some level.\n\nLets put the issue a different way. The foundational premise of dialectical materialism is that (counter-)revolutions occur when the superstructure (e.g., ruling ideology) is out of sync with the material reality (development of the means of production).

Anti-zionists control a little over 10% of the Knesset.
