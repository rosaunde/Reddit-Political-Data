The parliament, being composed mostly of socialists, supported a more gradual privatisation to prevent social instability, while Yeltsin believed in \"shock therapy\" and rapid economic reforms.\n\nThe parliament, led by Vice President Chairman Khasbulatov, tried to impeach and oust Yeltsin, which it had full right under the old, Soviet-era constitution (which gave supreme power to the parliament). Yeltsin, like a true liberal, responded by sending in tanks and bombarding the parliament building until it yielded. In the aftermath, he would create a new constitution that gave greater powers to himself, a system that Putin would inherit to usher in the authoritarian regime we live under today.\n\nThe conflict was also reflected on the streets, with pro-parliament mobs standing against the President's tanks while their opponents tried to disperse them. Interestingly, while Yeltsin's supporters were a homogenous group of liberals, the parliament was supported both by right-wing nationalists and leftists. Neither trusted Yeltsin, whom they saw as responsible for Russia's economic collapse. As a result, both the iconic imperial flag of the nationalists and the good ol' Red Banner flew together back then, sometimes even combined into a single flag.","created_utc":1530454115,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"venasabiertas","body":"I think its really not that black and white. I think a lot of things have to be considered, like the content of the election, the mobilization and level of political activity among the masses, the strength of the revolutionary movement, etc. We should be clear that no liberation will come from electing the right people into a bourgeois state, and that the overthrow of the ruling class and the creation of a really pro-people government is what is truly necessary. That's not to say there is never any point in elections or even in revolutionaries running for office. The Bolsheviks participated in both these things, but they were also in a different situation as us. I think one of the greatest lessons of Marxism is that we cannot just mechanically apply what works in other places to our own situation. We have to learn from the past (the good and bad) but really have to do our own concrete analysis of our particular situation. This means research, collective study with comrades, discussions and debates with coworkers, community members, family, friends, etc. And it means asking really deep questions about the contradictions we face which, I think, often reveal the necessity of revolutionary politics pretty quickly. Questions like, What does it represent that there are people like Ocasio-Cortez disturbing the status quo of the Democratic Party? What is the content of the 'socialism' these people are talking about? Why are these people running for office through the Democratic Party, instead of through a different party or as independents? Will voting for these people really bring systemic change to the daily life of workers and oppressed people? Etc. \n\nAt the level we're at in the US, I don't think that there is any benefit in supporting these social democrats, and that, as communists and revolutionaries, we should be working among the masses in as many spheres of society as we can\u2013\u2013the workplace, our communities, during protests, etc. etc. in order to advance a revolutionary pole that rejects both the ruling class parties instead of supporting a section of one of those parties. That isn't easy, and (barring some major national outrage that pushes large numbers of the masses towards revolution) you aren't going to convince a lot of people of revolution any time soon. But just engaging in critical discussion, putting ideas of resistance and revolution out there, and doing other political work in communities and workplaces can really make a difference and advance the people's struggle in ways that voting for a DSA candidate never can.","created_utc":1530483367,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"&gt;I think Bryant\u2019s argument implies something else important: Marx really does work, frequently, with a constitutive understanding of power. Or, to put things differently, Marx operates with an understanding of power as productive, rather than subtractive in the Foucauldian juridical sense. The C-M-C relation operates as a form of subjectification for workers (and capitalists) insofar as it constitutes the \u201ctruth\u201d of their world and how the economy works. In other words, and as Bryant signals by calling it a Nietzschean question, the point isn\u2019t one of ideology, where we can point out that the \u201ctruth\u201d is different from what the worker believes. Here, the worker really does experience the world in C-M-C terms, and the capitalist really does experience it as M-C-M\u2019; there is no underlying fact that would allow us to adjudicate a \u201ctruth\u201d beyond the subjectifying processes. In \u201cThe Mesh of Power\u201d lecture, Foucault credits Capital chapters 13-15 with such a view of power. In a recent paper on the Foucault-Marx relation, Sandro Chignola suggests that the discussion in chapter 4, especially the way Marx talks about the worker\u2019s body as incorporated into capital, implies that \u201cwhat precedes setting the worker to work is the subsumption of the force of work into capital, that is to say the realization of the conditions under which this [labor] power is actualized\u201d (51).* He accordingly proposes that chapter 4 is part of the setup for chapters 13-15.\n\nThis may be Nietzsche's understanding of truth but it sure as hell isn't Marx's. \n\nTo use another of Nietzsche's questions then, what is the value of defining truth in this way? I think there is none since Marxism already has the claim to truth through the concept of ideology which this framing retreats from without justification. Personally, I think this is the bad Nietzsche, since just as often as he was doubting truth, he was also historicizing it and implying that the crisis of truth is a *capitalist* crisis (or a crisis of modernity). The same contradiction is in Foucault, and he too is at his best when he is elaborating Marx's genealogy of bourgeois ideology rather than making ontological claims about truth and power beyond history. And considering the guy at \"larvalsubjects\" uses all the latest pomo philosophy to end up at generic liberalism, I doubt the value of this path.","created_utc":1530508784,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

Instead of fighting for legalization fight for something like the Nordic model and rehabilitation if you want to work within existing conditions. Primarily though understand that sex work is not like other work, and it's not a choice that a healthy society offers nor one a healthy individual chooses.\n\nGay men are in a similar position to woman, often there is a history of abuse and there's also other factors that I don't necessarily feel like getting too deep into, but there is a lot of misogyny manifested in gay male sexual behavior in regard to prostitution and the general fetishization of the sex itself. \n\nAll prostitution, stripping, pornography, etc should be illegal. In addition to being acts of objectification and degradation It encourages consumers of such acts to separate sex from the human being and treat it as a commodity to which they are entitled, to which their fetish (a manifestation of the phenomena itself) should be rightly fulfilled. For example try finding a woman under 40 today who hasn't been pressured into attempting anal sex. \n\nConcrete actions within the existing paradigm?

{"author":"RatfinxTwinkledinks","body":"&gt;flipping burgers\n\ndid you seriously suggest a form of wage labor that almost universally does not provide you with enough money to survive in the modern world as an alternative for sex work? I absolutely dread to see your solution to the fact a very large number of trans women opt (in as much as it is actually possible to choose when it comes to most types of work under capitalism) for sex work on the basis of things like cam shows being safer from violence than many \"real\" forms of employment when you're visibly trans. \n\nYour entire solution hinges on the idea of making sex work a completely non-viable avenue for survival because you think we can just very quickly fix the material factors that lead women into it, when the reality is that barring the full implementation of a socialist system, the criminalization of sex work under capitalism just leads to the criminalization of entire demographics (trans women being a major one). You're essentially proposing solving things backwards in such a way that it would remove one of the few avenues of survival for communities such as trans women BEFORE the abolition of the need for desperate measures to survive such as this. \n\nThe criminalization model that you advocate for on average presents a major win for pimps and human traffickers because illegal labor cannot collectively organize to defend itself from its exploiters. Its absurd to believe that criminalization can somehow reduce human trafficking or pimping when the vast majority of human trafficking and pimping already operates under sex work being a criminal act! The immense vulnerability of people whose work is declared criminal makes them easy targets for abuse and exploitation at the hands of pimps. Its absurd to claim that further criminalization will somehow solve this. It's an idealistic solution that is wholly proven to not work.\n\nThen again, you do seem to operate under the absurd belief that minimum wage jobs aren't literal starvation wages under modern capitalism and that the only sex workers deserving of any sympathy whatsoever are human trafficking victims, whereas everybody else simply opted into it and should be flipping burgers and GET A REAL JOB.","created_utc":1530600086,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"RatfinxTwinkledinks","body":"&gt; Nordic model\n\nPlease read more about this before you start openly advocating for social democratic policies. The \"Nordic model\" is in fact not as good towards the goals of ending sex work as you may want to believe. In fact there's plenty of evidence that it merely alters the avenues of exploitation:\n\n&gt;Under the \u2018Nordic Model\u2019:\n\n&gt;1. Sex workers can experience greater harassment due to the policing of clients on the street (Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Police Affairs 2004).\n\n&gt;2. Stigma against sex workers increases, which puts them at risk of violence from clients and community retribution (this stigma has been explicitly positioned as a positive effect of the Swedish legislation, since it is thought it will deter people from entering the sex industry \u2013 see Skarhed 2010).\n \n&gt;3. Sex workers can be displaced to outlying areas or more secluded times, for client protection, which creates additional risk (Hester and Westmarland 2004, Crago 2008, Kinnell 2008, Kr\u00fcsi et al 2014, Lyon 2014).\n    \n&gt;4. There is increased competition between those selling sex on the street, due to a reduction in those willing to buy publicly (Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Police Affairs 2004, Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare 2007, Levy and Jacobsson 2014), and this can lead to a depression in wages (Chu and Glass 2013-14).\n    \n&gt;5. Higher risk services (such as unprotected sex) are often offered due to lack of client choice, less bargaining power, and needing to negotiate more quickly with clients who may fear arrest (Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Police Affairs 2004, Hester and Westmarland 2004, Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare 2007, Kr\u00fcsi et al 2014, Levy and Jacobsson 2014, Lyon 2014, Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security 2014).\n    \n&gt;6. Some sex workers may engage in theft to make up for lost earnings (Levy and Jacobsson 2014), and are thereby criminalised by other means.\n    \n&gt;7. Clients become less willing to give sex workers their contact details, which is an important safety measure (Levy and Jacobsson 2014), or insist on \u2018outcalls\u2019 rather than services being provided in venues familiar to the sex worker (Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security 2014, ScotPEP 2015).\n    \n&gt;8. There are often prohibitions on sex workers working together, which is another key safety strategy, or on \u2018benefiting from the proceeds\u2019 of prostitution; this latter can criminalise sex workers\u2019 partners or prevent sex workers from cohabiting with them (Chu and Glass 2013-14).\n    \n&gt;9. Sex workers can become more reliant on potentially exploitative managers and third parties due to clients being less willing to negotiate the purchase of sex directly (Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Police Affairs 2004, Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare 2007, ScotPEP 2015).\n   \n&gt;10. Criminalisation deters clients who do not wish to commit a crime, but is less likely to deter clients who intend to abuse sex workers. Criminalising clients is likely to increase the proportion who are aggressive or dangerous, especially those who are purchasing sex on the street (UNAIDS 2009, ScotPEP 2015).\n\n&gt;11. There are effects on the provision of services, with sex workers having to conform to the narrative of the disempowered victim in order to access support (Danna 2012, Levy and Jacobsson 2014) and an increased belief that safety and rights are contingent on exiting the industry (Scoular and Carline 2014). Swedish support services do not operate with a \u2018harm reduction\u2019 model, which means that condoms are infrequently distributed or their distribution is even opposed as it is thought to \u2018encourage\u2019 prostitution (Chu and Glass 2013-14).\n\n&gt;12. There are effects on relations with police, with sex workers reluctant to report dangerous or violent clients due to concerns over a loss of their livelihood (Kr\u00fcsi et al 2014, Amnesty International 2015) and evidence that police are conducting surveillance and searches on sex workers and engaging in practices such as confiscating condoms for evidence, which create additional risks of HIV and other STIs (Kulick 2003, Kr\u00fcsi et al 2014).\n    \n&gt;13. In both Sweden and Norway, these laws have provided cover for practices such as the removal of sex workers\u2019 children and deportation of migrant sex workers (Kulick 2003, Amnesty International 2015, ScotPEP 2015).\n\n&gt;14. Sex workers face being reported to hotels or evicted from housing, as it is illegal to provide premises where sex work will take place (Levy and Jacobsson 2014). An Oslo police operation entitled \u2018Operation Homeless\u2019 involved police posing as clients to discover sex workers\u2019 addresses, and threatening landlords with criminal sanction if they did not evict them. Once someone is listed as an evicted sex worker, it is very difficult to find new housing (Ulla Bj\u00f8rndahl Oslo 2012).\n\n&gt;15. Negative relations between sex workers and the authorities means that they are less likely to reach out when they witness trafficking, abuse and exploitative working (Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Police Affairs 2004).\n\n&gt;16. A Norwegian government report on the Swedish sex purchase law found that it had created a \u2018buyers\u2019 market\u2019 and that violence against sex workers had increased (Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security 2014). Furthermore, Levy and Jakobsson (2014) argue that there is no reliable evidence to support the claim that the Swedish sex purchase law (sexk\u00f6pslagen) has created a reduction in prostitution. There is some evidence of a reduction in street prostitution but no reliable evidence to confirm that this has not been displaced into indoor markets \u2013 in fact there is evidence that this has indeed occurred (see Chu and Glass 2013-14).\n\n[This little piece](https:\/\/genderate.wordpress.com\/2016\/02\/21\/why-the-nordic-model-sucks\/) has a whole lot of citations of why this so-ideal nordic model being proposed here in fact does not lead to helping sex workers abandon sex work but rather just creates further avenues for marginalization. Attempts to further ban sex work itself under capitalism seem to be intrinsically doomed to removing an avenue of survival for many marginalized women (as I brought up in another part of this thread, transgender women are a huge group affected by this) and do not actually seem to be successful in stopping human trafficking. In practice the focus should be against pimps and human traffickers rather than against women who have often been provided no other choices by capitalism, and let's not fool ourselves into thinking that capitalism can or will benevolently provide these women with a means out of their situation of exploitation. The fact that some people are suggesting flipping burgers as a way out in this thread should be telling of how absurd the entire discussion has become. I'd say if your solution to such an extremely complex issue sounds like a right-wing meme you may need to reconsider.\n\nUltimately criminalization only empowers abusive exploiters such as pimps and human traffickers further, and legalization does not, on its own, provide for a good solution as seen by the fact that women are still actively trafficked into countries where sex work is legal. The only real solution is to empower the exploited against their oppressors, yet criminal justice solutions effectively prevent this from ever happening because it's a \"solution\" that allow the armed wing of the capitalist state to enact violence upon the exploited to the point of making them more vulnerable against those who oppress them. Legalization therefore can only be a prelude to real radical organization among exploited sex workers and can't on itself solve these issues... yet criminalization only leads to a situation where sex work becomes more exploitative, cruel and abusive, not less.","created_utc":1530600928,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

This results in a dynamic where you not only are coerced to not organize because that would require openly associating with a form of labor capitalist patriarchy finds despicable, but also because the main avenues of organization have been co-opted and corrupted by liberalism. Neither of these are intrinsic, unfixable problems with the idea of labor organizing on the part of sex workers, and in fact radical action can and should be directed towards addressing them.\n\nI don't see how you can look at this issue and come to the conclusion that the correct way to solve this is to further empower the capitalist state and its incredibly violent armed wing in order to deal with sex workers.

The NY Times article focuses mostly on some of the draconian and explicitly racist new policies and unsurprisingly less on the neoliberal policies aimed at dismantling a long-standing public service.\n\nIn Denmark there are around 550.000 common housing homes, that are owned by non-profits and run democratically by the tenants. Common housing organizations have existed since the middle of the 19th century and are aimed at offering housing at the lowest possible rent, especially to the poor and vulnerable. A portion of all common housing are specifically reserved for people who are socially vulnerable.\n\nA significant amount of the new policies are directly aimed at dismantling these organizations by:\n\n* Gentrifying the areas and offering incentives to sell homes, in addition they are also making it possible for buyers to kick out any current tenants\n\n* Disallowing those who receive most types of welfare payments from moving into common housing (I believe the most significant payments not included are those that seniors receive, go figure)\n\n* Literally allowing the state to dismantle common housing organizations that operate in \"ghettos\" if certain criteria are not met\n\nI should point out that, obviously, it is the government that has designated which areas are \"ghettos\" and as soon as immigrants are forced out of these currently designated \"ghettos\" they will move to the next cheapest homes. Of course the next cheapest homes are also owned by other common housing organizations, which will then be designated \"ghettos\". Rinse and repeat.\n\nJust imagine those neoliberal vultures salivating at the thought of thousands upon thousands of new homes circulating the housing market. No doubt a lot of these policies are made to specifically hurt immigrants, to appease the \"Danish People's Party\", but the neoliberals are in the money-business after all, they couldn't care less whose welfare they're cutting or what public services they are dismantling.\n\nOh and someone elsewhere in the thread, I think a fellow Dane, was saying that the ghettoplan is about making sure that immigrants are properly educated and given a better chance at making it in Denmark. I'll just point out that the plan is incentivizing high schools to kick out students, by letting the high school keep the money they're given for each student they enroll, even after they kick that student out and further penalizing the student monetarily.","created_utc":1530663101,"score":21,"subreddit":"communism"}

I'm not discussing the relationship between the core capitalist states including the US and Europeans and the peripheral former colonies of the core, which is certainly neocolonial in nature, but the relationship between Western Europe and the United States which is one of competing imperialist powers whose interests sometimes align in the broad strokes.\n\nIf we were to simply dub the nature of the relationship between the United States and the rest of the capitalist west in the post-war period as \"neocolonial\", it's essentially missing the fact that the Western European states were active imperialist agents who conflicted constantly with US capitalism. The popular struggles of the periphery ousted the colonial powers and subsequently the national bourgeoisie of the peripheral states either came under imperialist subjugation in a neocolonial relationship whereby they acted as a comprador class (usually under the thumb of the United States and\/or former colonial masters), or they were expropriated by the workers and peasants.\n\nThe culmination of this process in the late 20th century was the placing of European imperialism on the back burner and the realignment of forces which lead to what is now the European Union. The United States has only enjoyed global hegemony with regards to imperialism for the past 30 or so years and is already on the decline.\n\nSimply put, there's nothing to indicate that the relationship between Western Europe and the United States was neocolonial. Issues such as the Marshall Plan were subsidies to redevelop Western Europe so they could act as a bulwark against communism, they weren't a particularly effective bribe in of themselves that would result in the subservience of Western European capital to US capital. The relationship between France and NATO is useful to point at in this regard.

Well, reading what you said, I instantly remembered the experience of the Black Panther Party, not with the guns and all that, but with another example that Fred Hampton told in a discourse once: (I don't remember it exactly as he told it, but it went more or less like this) Bobby Seale and Huey Newton heard about a town (or a neighborhood) where there was a road crossing that had many accidents happening because it wasn't properly signed (stop signs etc.). So they went there (armed), picked a hammer and a STOP sign, and they hanged the sign on the road, while everyone around watched them doing it. In another occasion, the same thing happened, and they did it again, while the people watched. After that, those people learned that they could do it too, and the conclusion is that's how the masses learn, through practice and observation. Maybe you could gather some people that you feel are more \"advanced\" in the sense of wanting to organize and do something about your community and begin something more simple, and at the same time, while you organize the people in your community to solve your instant problems, you should promote study sessions, agitations, promoting political conscience, **class** conscience. You don't need **everyone** at the beginning, you need a group of dedicated people that will serve as an example for the rest to join the struggle. That's being the vanguard. In good time, it may grow from, say, a cleaning of the streets act (or something simple like that, of course, in the context of your own experience, of your community), to a **Free Breakfast for School Children Program**, and maybe grow into a true communist organization. But give it time, don't rush things, understand the situation and don't frustrate yourself, actions like these when matched with political agitation and the promotion of class conscience are always valuable, and are more revolutionary than any so-called \"communist\" parties that fights for seats in the parliament. \n\nI hope I've helped in any way.

{"author":"Neophytecomrad","body":"I'm going to be relatively brief because I'm on my mobile at work. First of all I want to touch on your perception of sex being reactionary\/conservative because while partially true to say that is the entirety of it is false. Sex is in fact a \"big deal\" that inherently triggers a huge range of emotional responses and places people in a state of vulnerability. This is why when a sexual experience is traumatic it can literally ruin someone's life. Your desire for sex to be something that is private and based on romantic relations is not reactionary. The traditional reactionary stance is one that is concerned with hetero dominance and male ownership of nonmale sexuality. Monogamy isn't reactionary merely the facade reactionaries use to obfuscate the desire to control nonmale sexuality. Liberals tend to see this as a mere double standard and then go on to conflate hedonism with liberation not realizing they are encouraging behaviors that are rooted in trauma. \n\nI doubt you need me to pull statistics given your knowledgeable responses elsewhere in this thread, but something like 60% of sex workers report being sexually abused in childhood for instance. Similar numbers with substance abusers. Behaviors like promiscuity, exhibitionism, voyeurisn, and polyamory all report similar figures. There's a clear pattern between childhood sexual trauma and these lifestyles. If you start exploring attachment disorders you get a picture about how even subtle things like acts of omission on the part of a care provider can cause a person to start deriving value and self worth from sexual attention regardless of how that attention manifests. Combined with the patriarchal nature of capitalism and you have a society that is sexually backwards and confused. \n\nThis isn't too say that monogamy is inherently correct for instance and that any deviation unhealthy, as there are some examples from ancient people's that suggest otherwise, but in the context of this society it is coupled with hypersexuality and rooted in trauma.  \n\nWhat I see is traumatic repetition being encouraged and validated by the status quo, and finding an individual who engages in group sex and exhibitionist behavior free of trauma is like finding a unicorn. \n\nUnfortunately for victims there is often a sense of false empowerment tied to these behaviors and the stigma piled into them by reactionaries has turned them away from actual understanding and help and instead into defending these behaviors as a legitimate lifestyle not to be questioned or judged. \n\nPornography thrives on this and perpetuates a culture of willing victims, who are drawn in by the thousands every year. \n\nSo what compels people to record themselves and share it? The desire for approval and acceptance, and they're going about it the only way they know how. ","created_utc":1530737680,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Second, there were contradictory interests in the West, and Britain was trying to avoid another war with France. After the Seven Years War (aka French-Indian War), Britain \"owned\" that territory west of the Appalachians (previously under French control), and had even promised and given out land grants to settlers for their fighting in the war against France (including George Washington, who had a land grant for 20,000 acres) *but* forbade settlement there, because they didn't want there to be a huge rebellion of indigenous people (Pontiac's rebellion actually started before Britain officially put out the Royal Proclamation which banned westward settlement, because the relationship between indigenous people and the French was better than with the British and natives hoped to push the British back east by some.

{"author":"theDashRendar","body":"Because the notion of 'failure' is largely one defined by propaganda.  The notion American mythmaking attempts to put into your head is that Russia was on par with Britain or America, went communist and then fell behind.  This is an inversion of events - Russia was well behind for hundreds of years, went communist, and then rapidly caught up.  \n\nReposting some points:\n\n\n1) Socialism has never been allowed to succeed (or fail) on its own merits, but only under the unending siege from imperialists, who will stop at nothing to see any and every socialist movement (with any real momentum behind it) in the world crushed: whether it be through direct invasions (as we saw in the Russian Civil War, when America, France, Britain, Germany and others all dropped what they were doing to invade the fledgling USSR, because a proletariat state even existing, is a very real challenge to their claims on power), assassinations, coups, blockades, embargoes, sabotage, extortion, contras, election-rigging, terrorism, kidnappings, and whatever other means are available to attempt to ruin, damage or destroy any effort to establish socialism anywhere on the planet. So socialists are forced to not only build socialism, but simultaneously fend off the most powerful empires in the world, endlessly, while trying to build socialism. This creates a rather nasty contradiction, where the only successful socialist states capable of holding territory for more than a few months are (forced to be) highly militarized. Socialism has never been left to be at peace.\n\n2) For hundreds of millions of people - socialism has worked - remarkably. Paraphrasing Parenti here, but for hundreds of millions of humans, really existing socialist states have taken people whose material conditions were inadequate (lacking food, lacking shelter, lacking clean water, lacking (real) freedom, lacking medicine, lacking political power, lacking any sort of life with dignity) and elevated them to a place in which their conditions were adequate (where they had those things). That's an enormous achievement - among the most significant in human history - and it is endlessly downplayed or ignored, especially in the west, because our conditions have been abundant for as long as we've known (which is largely a result of plundering the third world to the bone), so to wealthy westerners, adequate seems like quite a step down - but for billions of people on the planet, adequate would be an enormous improvement.\n\n3) Western media has endlessly filled its citizens heads with propaganda that communism is evil and has never worked and can only do bad (after all, the owners of said media have a rather significant investment in maintaining the status quo), and as such, will go to great lengths to suppress, downplay, or outright ignore the many achievements of communism. Cuba is among the world leaders in medical science. A tiny resource depleted island, under the largest and longest economic embargo in all of history, somehow achieves higher life expectancy and lower infant mortality than the United States. That's rather odd for such a failure of a system, no? The Soviet Union defeated Hitler and the Nazis - at extreme cost - and the west frequently downplays, misrepresents, or ignores the (decisive) Russian contribution to saving the world. Pol Pot's wicked regime (which the US still tried to recognize as legitimate for 10 years after it was toppled) met its end at the hand of the heroic Vietnamese communists, who had lost so much already defending their homeland from American invaders.\n\n4) Touching on the previous point - compare Russia in 1910 to any of the capitalist cores at the same time. If you were to do a \"Global Power Rankings,\" 1910 Russia would not even make the Top 5. Compare the 1910 Russian economy to 1910 Britain or 1910 America - it wasn't industrialized, very little rail, ~20% literacy, totally dependent on agriculture, with massive institutions from feudalism still in place. You could easily say they were 75-80 years behind Britain or America. Then compare that to 1960s Russia. Unambiguously 2nd in any global power ranking, fully literate, fully industrialized, rail connecting much of the country, putting humans in space and one of the world leaders in science, full education and healthcare for its citizens, eliminated homelessness, and some of the most impressive economic output in human history. Compared to 1960's Britain or England, they were now only 30-40 years behind. Even compare 1990 Russia (this is a delightfully awkward moment that neoliberals don't like to talk about, where for a small moment in history, Soviet GDP was actually larger than American GDP) - they were inventing cell phones and Tetris - they were only about 10-20 years behind America or Britain. They had almost completely caught up.\n\nThis is even where the whole etymology of first world, second world, third world comes from. Russia in the 1910s wasn't the first world, like England or Britain - they were not an advanced, developed economy. They were the third world. And then communism happened, and the conditions in Russia improved so much, so fast, that you could no longer call Russia the third world - they had to create a new status - the second world - for these countries who had closed the gap so significantly. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia fell behind again by at least a decade, and most of the country (outside the wealthier parts of Moscow or St. Petersburg) went right back to being the third world, where much of the country remains to this day.","created_utc":1530774156,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Nikephorus16","body":"The US bourgeoisie is much stronger than the European bourgeoisie and is normally very good at bullying their junior partners into doing what is in the best interests of the US. \n\nThe problem now is that Russia has a government which doesn't follow the dictates of a comprador class heavily entangled with organized crime but one that represents the interests of the national bourgeoisie. This Russian government wants a seat at the table of imperialist powers. Letting Russia participate in the collective management of Eurasia's affairs would create a potential counter pole to the US bourgeoisie. Europe's governments would be faced with a choice: remain with the US or try to see what business we can do with Russia to exploit the workers of Eurasia. Many capitalists see the latter option as being preferable, eying Russia's large oil and gas interests among others. \n\nFor the US, allowing Russia to be an equal partner in Europe is an utter impossibility. The US derives its economic power primarily from the ability to maintain the dollar as the world reserve currency. This is bought with the military might of the US's many, strong, experienced military industrial conglomerates. They see increased capital investment in the Russian economy by British and German capitalists as a threat to the dollar's supremacy. If large economies in Europe leave the dollar and begin denominating their assets in rubles or renminbi, then the dollar system is over for good. \n\nThus aggression towards and demonization of Russia and, to a lesser extent, China in this current period signals that US capitalists are nervous and feeling the subterranean pressure of inter imperialist rivalries beginning to reassert themselves in an extremely forceful way. Russia is not currently imperialist. But it wants to be, and allowing a potential rival to get powerful would seriously hurt the US's interests. Russia-gate is a scare tactic used to frighten those capitalists who are thinking about engaging in normal economic relations with the Russians. I also want to add that I don't think China is imperialist either, actually far from it. But that's another story...\n\n[This is a great article on the topic.](https:\/\/www.liberationnews.org\/past-point-no-return-russiagate-reorientation-u-s-imperialism\/)","created_utc":1530839152,"score":66,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"internettext","body":"There is a political benefit to conscription, anti-war sentiment is usually much higher, which makes starting wars harder, and the name of the game is to avoid the wars, because wars are bloodbaths and once you are at that point, this becomes intellectual masturbation for the correct legal framework of slaughtering people, not really an ethical question.\n\n&gt; But when you conscript someone you're forcing a proletarian to fight in terrible conditions against their will, subjecting them to the horrors of war without giving them a say.\n\nYeah the alternative is lying and tricking people, if you conveyed the reality of war nobody would show up (aside from a few people that really enjoy killing). I'm not sure about the technical ethical difference between forcing people or tricking people into war.\n\n&gt; Is it not needed anymore? \n\nneeded ? You mean can it be avoided ?

{"author":"PrinceKapone","body":"Russia is being demonized and punished for thwarting and undermining the US agenda in the world. For example: opposing the Iraq war; condemning the attack on Libya; stopping the US from attacking Iran by brokering the P5+1 nuclear deal; and preventing the West from overthrowing Assad in Syria. Russia is determined to pursue it's own national interests instead of the interests of the US. The main thing the US won't tolerate is truly independent governments who pursue their own national interests. ","created_utc":1530853699,"score":18,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Neophytecomrad","body":"\/u\/A_Gentlemens_Coup posted a good elementary explanation of dialectical materialism a while back on the \/r\/communism101 sub. I suggest using the search function there or making a post to learn more. \n\n&gt; The original dialectic was a form of logical debate where people representing opposing sides sought to arrive at a mutual truth. Thus, the general form \"dialectics\" is a contest or struggle between opposites to arrive at some third point of agreement or resolution.\n\n&gt; Hegel's dialectics, which Marx's dialectics are based on, is a metaphorical (sometimes called \"idealist\") dialectic where the formation of opposite but related ideas creates a tension that changes the original idea to create a third new, but related, idea. This is different from the original dialectic because it isn't a formal debate between two people that becomes resolved, but an ongoing process of contradictory ideas changing each other, creating new ideas with their own contradictions, etcetera.\n\n&gt; Marx called himself a student of Hegel, but said Hegel had applied his ideas to the wrong thing; instead of pure ideas, the dialectic should be applied to the material, like the economy. For example, the tension between workers demanding higher wages and better conditions and the capitalist trying to increase profits creates a tension, a contradiction. This contradiction (along with many others) would eventually cause the creation of a society where the workers are the owners and thus the natures of workers and owners are altered in a way that resolves the contradiction. He called this society socialism, and this application of Hegel's dialectic to the material is dialectical materialism -- the idea that there are material contradictions within society that will eventually result in a collapse followed by a transformation to resolve the contradiction.\n\n&gt; Historical materialism or the materialist conception of history is an extremely closely related idea that says these material contradictions are the driving force behind history and the primary cause of social change and the collapse or transformation of past societies. It's often used interchangeably with dialectical materialism in these contexts.","created_utc":1530971379,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

During the Civil War, Ethiopia, with Soviet backing, was also responsible for chemical attacks with UN-banned poison gasses against Eritreans who were fighting for their independence from Ethiopia (the UN forced the federation of the two countries and the Ethiopian Empire later annexed Eritrea. Both events sparked outrage among Eritreans, but keeping Eritrea part of Ethiopia was in Soviet interests because it gave Ethiopia access to the Red Sea and thus, gave the Soviets a stronger control over international trade routes, especially oil, through the Suez Canal and Indian Ocean). The Derg was anything but pro-people or democratic.

Somalia launched an invasion, so many secession groups sprang up, maoists were launching their own war against the derg, and ofcourse China and the US did what they could to undermine Ethiopia.

The Marines are trained to be killing machines through and through, but most of them, like my friend, never have to fire a weapon with the intent of killing anyone. He spent the majority of his time as a Marine at desk jobs at bases around the world, handling logistics and supply distributions.

The military and ex military personnel who have been put in combat scenarios are the most prepared, experienced, and trained to do that. If they want to use their training against the capitalists, I say we welcome them with open arms. It\u2019s not a pretty picture or an idealistic one, but it is a necessary one. We sure as hell aren\u2019t going to win if all of the most combat experienced people in the US side with the capitalists in a revolutionary scenario. \n\nAdditionally, I think you severely overestimate how much kids coming straight out of high school and joining the military know about what really goes on in the US\u2019s imperialist endeavors. These soldiers get thrown into scenarios they do not really understand, where a lot of innocent people are killed in their homes, and where their fellow soldiers die in wars that don\u2019t accomplish much of anything besides lining some fat cat capitalists\u2019 wallets. There are pretty definitive reasons why so many soldiers came back from Iraq and Afghanistan with ptsd and all sorts of problems functioning in a normal society again: being a soldier in an imperialist force that commits mass murder will fuck you up in the head if you have a shred of humanity left in you (which most soldiers do). \n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t a socialist revolution give those people a chance at redemption, a chance to put their training to use in a cause to make a better world - a world without imperialism and senseless slaughter for profit? The alternative is that we reject them and demonize them, and make the revolution that much more difficult to accomplish because we make enemies out of the people who are most prepared to help us succeed. \n\nAlso, I think equivocating the military and police displays a severe misunderstanding of the functions of both organizations. The police are an organization that uses force to socially control the populace and suppress discontent against the state, which is very apparent to people even from a young age. When people sign up with the police, they are swearing to uphold the laws as they are written, and the people who sign up with the police definitively know what they are signing up for. They are class traitors. \n\nThe military on the other hand uses all sorts of misleading idealism, patriotism, nationalism, and economic incentives to coerce typically lower class youths to fight and die to \u201cdefend the nation,\u201d when the reality is that these soldiers are a tool of the capitalist class in their imperialist endeavors to exploit and control the working class in places around the globe. A soldier of the US military is in the position of a class traitor, but a good chunk of military personnel have little to no awareness of that reality. The savagery of imperialistic interventions wake up many soldiers and ex military personnel to that reality, and those who do have that realization should be welcomed as allies.

While never officially conquered by a foreign power, the Empire maintained independence through deals with imperialist powers. When Fascist Italy invaded Ethiopia, the Ethiopian masses rose up in resistance, while Emperor Selassie appealed to other imperialists in the League of Nations, since at this time Selassie was trying to rapidly \"modernize\" Ethiopia, with reforms meant to bring Ethiopia partially out of feudalism and make it an attractive country for foreign investment. However Ethiopia remained semi-feudal. In 1973 the Ethiopian ruling class faced a crisis as workers went on strike, students demonstrated in the streets, Ethiopia faced border wars, and faced famine. Eventually this mass protest movement led to massive popular demand for regime change and to bring down the monarchy. But this was done by a faction of the military supported by the USSR (the Derg), not through a revolution of the masses. Eventually genuine resistance to the Derg was then subordinated to Western imperialism, as leading resistance groups like the EPRDF took aid from the United States in the early 90s and since 1991 Ethiopia has increasingly worked to attract foreign investment in order to accomplish a variety of neoliberal reforms. The country still is very semi-feudal, with 85&amp;#37; of the labor force in subsistence agriculture (with a small portion of those in agriculture working in cash-crops). Several imperialist countries (and financial organizations like the IMF) have been investing and given aid and loans to Ethiopia since the 2000s, including the US, EU, China, and Japan.

{"author":"MJoker_","body":"Seriously? Are you really trying to turn Marx, as Lenin (iirc) said, into a \"mediocre liberal\"?\n\nOk, let's go, then.\n\n&gt; \"between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.\"\n\nI don't know what this quote from the Critique of the Gotha Program has got to do with anything - even more so since he is talking clearly about the revolutionary transformation of a society -, but are you going to ignore the fundamental character of the state, i.e, the apparatus to rule a class over another? \n\nAs Engels put it, in [*Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State*](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/ch09.htm)\n\n&gt;As the state arose from the need to keep class antagonisms in check, but also arose in the thick of the fight between the classes, **it is normally the state of the most powerful, economically ruling class, which by its means becomes also the politically ruling class, and so acquires new means of holding down and exploiting the oppressed class.**\n\nAlso, as Lenin pointed out in [*State and Revolution*](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/lenin\/works\/1917\/staterev\/ch05.htm), the Bourgeois democracy is nothing but \"Democracy for an insignificant minority, democracy for the rich--that is the democracy of capitalist society.\"\n\nThe Bourgeois state can be understood, then, in two aspects: I) Its open fascistic dictatorship or II) It's liberal democracy. The later \"means nothing except allowing the renewal of the authorities of this old and rotting order, that it means nothing else\", as the greatest Communist alive pointed out. \n\nSo, tell me again: how it's not correct? \n\nMoving further.\n\n&gt; But, Marx acknowledged that it was possible to establish communism within a democratic system. He allowed for the possibility of peaceful transition in some countries with strong democratic institutional structures.\n\nNow, this shit pissed me off. Literally from the most basic writing, [*The Manifesto of the Communist Party*](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/ch04.htm):\n\n&gt;The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. **They openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions.** Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. \n\nWhere the fuck do you got that from? Marx was a revolutionary, ffs. Link me where he said anything similar to that.\n\n&gt;And even then, voting in no way prevents you from trying to achieve communism through other means. If you're only voting and nothing else, you're doing it wrong. But if you're not voting, you're also doing it wrong.\n\nVoting means nothing, even more so in the Imperialist stage. Marx, Engels and Lenin clearly understood that. As Lenin pointed out, from [The State: A Lecture Delivered at the Sverdlov University](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/lenin\/works\/1919\/jul\/11.htm),\n&gt;The power of capital is everything, the stock exchange is everything, **while parliament and elections are marionettes, puppets.**\n\nA Communist should boycott elections and fight to build a new power. If only you were arguing for electing Communists to denounce the Bourgeois parliament, **like the Bolsheviks did**, then it would be understandable, albeit wrong and inadequate, but not even that.\n\n&gt;To say that democracy and communism do not mix is to ignore that the end goal of socialism is direct democracy in which the people, not the bourgeoisie, control their government.\n\nDemocracy is a tool of class struggle. Communism ends democracy, as Engels pointed out. \n\n&gt;Lastly, you can't ignore the many examples in which a so-called \"communist\" or \"democratic\" revolution resulted in a much more oppressive and totalitarian regime. Not to say that violent revolution is never warranted, but it's not always the solution and it doesn't automatically yield good results.\n\nAh, I see. You're a lost liberal, then.

Believing so is, at worse, revisionism and, at best, fringes of liberalism.\n\nSecond of all, Communism will not be democratic because democracy is a toll of class struggle. Ending class struggle, ends democracy. Socialism and the DotP will be democratic but Communism won't. From *State and Revolution*\n\n&gt;Thirdly, in speaking of the state \u201cwithering away\", and the even more graphic and colorful \u201cdying down of itself\", Engels refers quite clearly and definitely to the period after \u201cthe state has taken possession of the means of production in the name of the whole of society\", that is, after the socialist revolution. We all know that the political form of the \u201cstate\u201d at that timeis the most complete democracy. But it never enters the head of any of the opportunists, who shamelessly distort Marxism, that Engels is consequently speaking here of democracy \u201cdying down of itself\", or \u201cwithering away\". This seems very strange at first sight. But is is \u201cincomprehensible\u201d only to those who have not thought about democracy also being a state and, consequently, also disappearing when the state disappears. Revolution alone can \u201cabolish\u201d the bourgeois state.

It definitely shows(at least to me) that the party has recognized the importance of working with more radical collectives in order to further its growth and attract new members.\n\nSome notes of mine:\n\n-What I like most about the CPUSA in Houston is that it has been for a long time focused on the trade union movement. I'm not sure how familiar all of ya'll are about Texas, but unions in TX are very much NOT a thing. That said, Houston and Southeast Texas are actually fairly strong union areas, with the United Steelworkers, Pipefitters, and various other trade unions organizing among people working in the petrochemical plants. Not too long ago there was a major strike in my hometown that went on for several weeks due to a contract and working conditions dispute and was resolved successfully in the union's favor. \n\n-I also appreciated Bernard's commentary regarding \"selling\" socialism. What we've got to do here as socialists working in the belly of the beast is raise class consciousness among the working class. \n\n-I didn't like that Bernard spent rather a lot of time dissing the WWP, SWP, SAlt, ISO, DSA, etc. I can understand there being some tension there of course, but I don't think that it was necessary.\n\n-I'm not sure how I feel about dual membership, either. I'm a dual CPUSA\/DSA member and am gravitating away from DSA membership because of the increasing liberalism I'm seeing from DSA leadership.\n\n-I'm also not a big fan of focusing on electoral politics. I don't see participation in bourgeois elections as the way forward, and while I can understand the appeal(the thrill of the race, etc), I think it is rather a waste of time.\n\n-I appreciated the pamphlets put together by the Houston YCL, though I wish there were some more recent examples of communist literature being handed out. I also think that getting your own button machine is a good idea, and making your own buttons can be a definite exercise.

In the Marxist-Leninist view, Socialism is the mode of production that replaces Capitalism, and is characterized by a Dictatorship of the Proletariat (the Communist Party runs the state in the interest of the proletariat) and a centrally planned economy (the state owns the means of production). Currently, their are only 5 countries, that are currently in the Socialist mode of production, China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, and Laos. Communism is the mode of production that will succeed Socialism and is characterized by a stateless and classless society that is based on Karl Marx's principal of \"from each according to his ability, and to each according to his need\". Obviously, no current or historical society has reached the Communist mode of production, and even if the entire world became Socialist (in the Marxist definition), it could take over 1000 years for Communism to be reached. Social Democracy on the other hand is not a different mode of production from Capitalism, and still involves a Dictatorship of the Bourgeoise, and lacks a centrally planned economy. Instead, Social Democracy is a system wher the State provides a robust Safety-net to its citizens, usually including such things as Single-Payer healthcare, Free College, strong Unions, and a robust Social Insurance system, payed for by Taxation. However, the main flaw with this system is that it fails to solve the key problem that as long as their is a Dictatorship of the Bourgeoisie, and a Free Market economy, the proletariat will never achieve real control over their future and will forever be bound to Wage Slavery even if they are thrown a few bones to keep them from revolting.\n\n2.

Imagine if not one single person voted the United States...the Republicans and Democrats would both cease to exist and their liberal imperialist society would essentially crumble. They continue to exist and exercise their power only because their population gives legitimacy to their corrupt and evil government and treats it as a valid and  \"good\" form of ruling.","created_utc":1531093520,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"corvibae","body":"I'm kind of torn on the issue. I typically only vote in local elections, which also are commonly held(in Texas) at the usual times of general elections and mid-terms. I feel like government at the local level is what people see and feel most often. My U.S. congressman has been to my part of the district a grand total of three times since he was elected. People know his name from seeing it on the news and on the ballot, but nobody really knows this man. Not really. However, school boards, local city councils, and county courts tend to have a much bigger effect on the average working person. They control how tax revenue is spent. The one really notable difference for me was the 2018 Texas Democratic Senate primary.\n\nThere were three candidates, but the two that most concern me right now are Robert \"Beto\" O'Rourke, and Sema Hernandez. O'Rourke is from an upper class family in El Paso, a number of years ago his father got him elected to the city council. While a city councilman, he worked to pass ordinances that allowed his dad to buy up large sections of poor, latinx neighborhoods, tear them down, and gentrify the area. They were both personally enriched by these actions. His nickname \"Beto\" was actually bestowed upon him by his childhood nanny. From beginning to end, Beto O'Rourke, was a liar, his campaign was built upon lies, and helped by the Democratic Party from beginning to end. He received national attention, and thus, won the primary.\n\nThe second candidate I mentioned, Sema Hernandez, is a communist. She is a working class latina woman whose platform focused on supporting immigrants(both documented and undocumented) and building a working class movement. She campaigned all across the state on her own dime and had a little more than $10,000 in the bank at any one time. She lost. She got over 260,000 votes, but lost. After witnessing the effortless way that O'Rourke won, and the fight from the beginning which eventually led to Hernandez's loss, I was disgusted. I am disgusted.\n\nThere really is no hope for the Democratic Party. That primary will be the last one in which I participate, and I'm not sure whether or not I will ever cast a vote for president, senator, or congressman ever again. However, I feel that voting in local elections can be of some use, so I cannot directly spoil my ballot. \n\nIt's up to you, comrade. Good luck. God bless.

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"Sorry was on vacation. Yeah I mean the Maoists. As to your question, for me the essential thing is that India is barely a nation. It is the most internally diverse country the world and the level of development isn't enough for a real national culture to have developed among the masses. That's why you have communists in power for decades in certain regions basically running through local political issues while other areas have large areas completely outside government control because maoists. The secular nationalism of the national congress was a failure, as we can see by the breakdown of Indian state politics into communalist fascism. The Philippines is pretty similar because of geography where you have vast political differences between regions and combined and uneven development within nationalist ideology though that's just a guess without real investigation. I imagine all the Maoist movements thrive in similar conditions since rural people's war kind of implies vast areas excluded from the national project. That's not to say Maoism is only possible in those conditions, only that we're talking about Maoist insurgency *in peacetime* which is fascinating if you think about it (for example what American culture would look like if vast areas of the south or midwest were completely inaccessible to the government). If communism succeeds when \n\n&gt;(1) when it is impossible for the ruling classes to maintain their rule without any change; when there is a crisis, in one form or another, among the \u201cupper classes\u201d, a crisis in the policy of the ruling class, leading to a fissure through which the discontent and indignation of the oppressed classes burst forth. For a revolution to take place, it is usually insufficient for \u201cthe lower classes not to want\u201d to live in the old   way; it is also necessary that \u201cthe upper classes should be unable\u201d to live in the old way; (2) when the suffering and want of the oppressed classes have grown more acute than usual; (3) when, as a consequence of the above causes, there is a considerable increase in the activity of the masses, who uncomplainingly allow themselves to be robbed in \u201cpeace time\u201d, but, in turbulent times, are drawn both by all the circumstances of the crisis and by the \u201cupper classes\u201d themselves into independent historical action.\n\nThink about what it means for that to be the norm over decades for millions of people. Think about who is so excluded that they do not even get to be robbed in peacetime without complaint.\n\nAll of that is to say it's difficult to speak of the communist party and the Maoists in the way we talk about ideologies in the West. The communists in West Bengal and Kerala are vastly different, and arbitrarily dividing communist ideologies by national borders (for example accepting that the tasks of the Indian communists are different than the Chinese communists) starts to break down within the Indian loose nation (this applies generally to third world nations but India is the most extreme example). The CPI has done some pretty bad things to the Maoists and are clearly a revisionist party. But within the Indian nation, which is now in complete breakdown, such generalizations aren't much use. 90% of the material the Indian Maoists publish is local analysis of particular struggles, if we want to seriously talk about these groups we need the same level of knowledge. And I don't think this question is that important right now except in the West, the Indian state government doesn't need revisionist communists to suppress Maoism violently, they're doing just fine under fascism.","created_utc":1531100010,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

Basically, in attacking the anti communism of the post-colonialists, he is really attacking orthodox Marxism-Leninism (no surprise trots are the only ones who can defend it then since MLs do not exist in western academia). Chibber is useful in tracing how a particular interpretation of Marxism, which many of us agree with, ends up at anti communism and orientalism given a few logical steps, since the initial roots of subaltern studies in not only Marxism but the Indian Marxism of the CPI are not well known. Subaltern studies is so ridiculous that it's easy to attack but it has interesting roots and has a history which is directly relevant to the discussion we are having about Maoism and revisionism.\n\nBut we don't have to pick either side, a concept of the universalizing tendency of capital as a tendency (like the model of Perry Anderson which I am partial to) allows us to both analyze the concrete history of Indian\/French\/British history and understand the bourgeois revolution as a theoretical concept and not an empirical description. Althusser's critique of empiricism applies wholesale to Chibber's work. This is to take seriously that Althusser can lead to poststructuralism and anti communism but *doesn't have to* which is our job.\n\nE: all of this is to say that imperialism, the foundation of Marxism-Leninism as a theoretical break, already solves the question of how capitalism can be both universalizing and particularizing. We do not need to claim that capitalism as such doesn't apply to the third world because imperialism makes it look different but we also don't need to go back and claim that capitalism was always particular and never universal and therefore imperialism isn't a break at all.","created_utc":1531163260,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

But the issue is when the torch needs to be passed to the next leader, the centralized nature of power in communist systems creates a vicious cycle of turmoil and internal chaos. \n\nIn terms of economics, I\u2019ll refer to human nature on this one. It is paramount that we examine what motivates the masses. The answer is simple: progress. In an egalitarian society, hope for progress is stripped away. Sure if everyone did their part well the entire system would improve. The issue with this is not everyone will do their part. Then you notice this and because everything is shared, you don\u2019t give it 100%. Again, this is a vicious cycle which will inevitably lead to destruction, because as economic conditions deteriorate people become desperate (this is how radical leaders come to power). But when you have the chance to get more the harder you work this has the power to motivate. Well designed systems are ones that align hard work with incentives. This is what people need to continue their hard work. \n\nI do implore you to give me some examples of a society (on a mass scale) that thrived under communism for let\u2019s say 20+ years. \n\n\nThere are countless capitalist, or mixed capitalist systems that have done just that. Is capitalism perfect? God no. Is there a shit ton of corruption? Of course.

{"author":"dopplerdog","body":"Argie here, and this is a favourite topic of mine so I could write volumes about this if not stopped.\n\nShort answer: it's complicated.\n\nLonger answer: Peronism isn't a coherent set of ideas, it's more of an anti-imperialist nationalist movement, attracting extremes of left and right.  It's incorporated both marxists and fascists into its fold, forming an amorphous blob at war with itself.  It doesn't so much stand for something as stand against something - against \"foreign capital\", and against the agro-exporting local elites.\n\nWe have 3 main periods in Peronism - his early presidencies, his third presidency in the 70s (which I lived under), and the period following his death.\n\nRegarding the first, it's worth noting Peronism's roots.  It stems from the monopolisation of political power by the ruling agro-exporting elites, the disenfranchisement of the working class, and the refusal by traditional communist and socialist parties to address the concerns of the argentine working class (these considered material conditions in Argentina not to be ripe for revolution, and subordinated their interests to those of the Soviet Union, in effect supporting the agro-exporting elites in the process).  It was in this context that a leader who championed workers' interests emerged - naturally from the military, which provided a good portion of the leadership of the country.   Peron was placed in power by popular acclaim - I suspect even he was surprised with his new found popularity.   You can throw all sorts of criticism at Peron - but Peronism as such is less about Peron, and more about the grassroots movement which put him in power.  The result for the worker was higher wages, better working conditions, a political voice, nationalisation of major industries and resources - it's fair to say that he was deeply loved by working people, and justifiably so.  But it was the workers themselves who won these things - it was their struggle that allowed Peron to rubber stamp all these gains.  Peron is a mere figurehead.  Unfortunately, the Communist Party of Argentina reiterated that revolution was not ripe, was suspicious of Peron's fascist leanings - and sided with the opposition.  This led to them losing quite a bit of support from working people.  Also unfortunately, Peron was no revolutionary - he was a Bonapartist of sorts, thinking the state can mediate between social classes.  So this posed a problem for the prospect of revolution in Argentina.\n\nThe second Peronism, that of his 73 presidency (his third, which I lived under) is also less about him, and more about the social context of the country.  Peron was ousted in 55 by the elites, and his political party proscribed.  That meant a return to low wages, privatisation, terrible working conditions, censorship, electoral fraud, etc.  So for 18 years, workers suffered the indignity of having their chosen leader in exile, and having the most popular political party proscribed.  Of course, this led to escalating armed resistance - sabotage, bombings, kidnappings, guerrillas.  But people from both the left and the right joined in this struggle, and the sole goal was to get Peron back.  This led to the military agreeing for Peron to return - on the condition that he restore order (eg stop the guerrillas).  And that he did: when he returned in 73, the Peronist right wing turned on the left, and it became open season on leftists.  This is a dark side to the Peron's 73 government. But again, Peron is just a figurehead, and is not the movement.  Again, it was the workers themselves, working through the Peronist movement, that brought the military dictatorship down. \n\nPeron's death in 74 led to his incompetent wife taking over (this is Isabel, his second one, not the more famous Evita).  Surrounded by right wing thugs, she was unable to control the chaos, and this finally led to the 76 junta - the darkest period in argentine history where 30,000 people disappeared, and the workers movement was left in tatters.  The Communist Party of Argentina, again, supported the proscription of Peronism, and gave tacit support to the Junta - mainly because at the time the USSR was buying quite a bit of grain from Argentina.  Argentine guerillas sent a delegation to the USSR seeking help against the Junta - they were rebuffed (presumably they thought they'd be able to get assistance from them like Cubans did back in the 50s).\n\nOnce the Junta fell in 83, Peronism was revitalised - but again the mix is contradictory.  Menem is nominally a Peronist but a neoliberal.  Kirchner was a peronist, but was in favour of nationalisation, of spending on social programs, etc.  Most Peronists today are nationalists, support nationalising industry and resources, social programs, higher wages, oppose further loans from the IMF, etc.\n\nThere's a few things to take away from this.  Firstly, Peronism is not coherent - it's neither right nor left.  It attracts people who are against foreign domination, i.e., nationalists.  This means it's mostly about sovereignty against imperialism.  Secondly, it's not about the leader, Peron.  The triumphs of Peronism have been fought for and won by the working class.   Thirdly, it is a sad situation where workers in Argentina have not been well represented by the Communist Party of Argentina.  At every step of the way, they've opposed Peronism and sided instead with the agro-exporting elites and military - either because of distrust of Peronism as fascism, because of a belief the material conditions weren't ripe, or because of Soviet realpolitik.   The reality is that workers had won tangible benefits under a very difficult situation, and the Communist Party opposed this movement. It's no surprise that workers in Argentina have had little time for the Communist Party, instead turning to Peronism, and to a lesser extent anarchism and Trotskyism (e.g. anarchism was extremely popular among workers prior to Peron).  And it pains for me to say this as I'm M-L.  \n\nI understand that the world had spheres of influence, and that South America was in the US back yard - after the Cuban missile crisis, the USSR clearly had to tread carefully there.  And 1973 is also the year Allende was overthown in Pinochet's coup, which showed the US meant business in the area.   Argentine workers had no support from their Communist Party or the Soviet Union in their struggle - to them, the USSR was just another imperial power buying what they produced from the local agro exporting elites.  I also appreciate that Peronism is a dead end due to it not being revolutionary - but the game the Communist Party of Argentina was playing was a very long one.  One of the goals of the 73 generation, made up by the left wing of the Montoneros, was to *turn Peronism revolutionary, even by dragging Peron kicking and screaming if necessary*.  It could have happened through working class struggle, but it wasn't to be.  Perhaps that shows that the material conditions for revolution weren't there, but what was the alternative?  Letting the elites take over again wasn't an option - however, that is precisely what ended up happening.","created_utc":1531201107,"score":10,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"IronMyr","body":"No, fascism isn't the use of force to curtail personal liberty. Only in the state of nature can someone have total personal liberty, and even in such cases governments form as an inevitable result of humans using their total personal liberty to exert force upon and curtail the personal liberty of others. Every government, by definition, uses some form of force to curtail some form of personal liberty. This includes a wide range of actions, starting with the simplest tribal governments using communal shunning to drive those suspected of disrupting the social or supernatural order to the edges of society. Fascist governments certainly use force to curtail personal liberty, even moreso than many other known political structures, including using explicit and hidden force in both physical and social forms to curtail political and pseudopolitical speech. However, Communist and Anarchist governments would also have to use force to curtail personal liberty, whether that takes the form of social exclusion of those individuals who disrupt the social order or a complex network of physical and social violence to crush dissidence.\n\nFascism is a complex and hard-to-define social, political, and economic system, with a history that stretches back (most historians and anthropologists argue) less than 200 years. From studying governments that are clearly fascist or for which strong arguments can be made to support the supposition that those governments are fascist in form if not necessarily in name, we can state with great confidence certain social, political, and economic properties that most or all fascist governments possess.\n\nA fascist society derives its values from a framework of competitive conflict. Fascist societies see both internal and external threats, and so support policies and social systems that strengthen the groups to which the fascists belong, to assure that they win and those that would threaten them lose. A fascist society promotes domestic prosperity by placing the greatest burdens of social and economic development on certain \"out\" groups and giving the benefits of that suffering primarily to those who belong to other \"in\" groups. For foreign affairs, a fascist society usually believes that foreign powers have purposefully or through negligence mistreated and oppressed them, and only through violent conflict can the fascist society reclaim that which was taken from them.\n\nA fascist government is primarily defined by a single party state, wherein social and political advancement and power are largely restricted to those who join and serve the single party. In exchange for this monopoly on power, the fascist government promises to create a stronger and more prosperous state, where the values and people of the society can dominate and crush the values and peoples seen as out groups. In turn, the people support the party's monopoly on power, ranging from paying lip service to the values and power of the party to allowing the party to directly shape the social institutions that dominate the lives of the in group to risking one's life in war to assure the domination of the in group against out groups. The power and direct action of the fascist government requires certain technologies and social institutions, such as sufficiently wide-spread and powrrful mass media and surveillance systems, which is why fascism has only become a major political force in the last century.\n\nAs a consequence of this fascist single-party rule, the fascist economy is dominated by a complex network of private interests and government investment. A fascist economy differs from a capitalist economy because the fascist government is willing to allow a single company to dominate an industry without complaint or concern, provided that that company is totally loyal to the fascist government and serves to make the society. However, a fascist economy differs from a communist economy in that the economy is still primarily controlled by private interests and social classes are viewed as inevitable, necessary, and positive, class conflict and conflict within a class being forms of competition that serve to create a more powerful society.\n\nWhat, then, is the primary value of fascism (a simplification of complex and often undirected social forces)? Through conflict, a group may become more secure and more prosperous, at the expense of other groups, personal liberty, and individual prosperity.\n\nThese certainly describe the archetypal fascist state, Nazi Germany. The Nazis certainly prosecuted out groups within the state, most notably Jews, gender and sexual minorities, and the disabled. They also fought against outsiders who they viewed as having prosecuted the German people, notably the imperial powers that had erected massive social systems to meet the needs of growing populations while leaving Germans to starve both literally and economically, and furthermore attempting to turn Germany itself into a vassal state by devastating their economy, blaming them for the social and economic forces that caused WWI and were largely beyond the control of the Germans, and taking away their ability to maintain a large military capable of protecting them from the predations of their extrmely militant neighbors. The Nazi party definitely dominated both the government, with Hitler placing himself as dictator and giving appointments to his supporters, and social power, using their widespread influence to give advantage to Nazis and locking outsiders out of crucial sociopolitical positions. The Fascist economy was also dominated by private companies with close ties to the Nazi party and who purported to strengthen and serve the people. Most famously, the Nazi government invested heavily in Volkswagen and gave them special permissions to raise funding in unconventional manners, believing that giving every German family a car would be an essential element of bringing the Germans up to a modern level of prosperity and also recognizing that automobile manufacturing could easily be converted to meet the needs of the total wars that dominated warfare at the time.\n\nThis still leaves us the question of whether or not Antifa is a fascist group. First of all, it should be noted that Antifa is neither a government nor an economy, but since it could be argued that Antifa is a society, they could be fascist in a sense. However, Antifa meets none of the core pieces that define a fascist society. While Antifa certainly has enemies outside of its \"society\", namely fascist groups, they are an international organization that has a large track record of accepting anyone willing to take up arms for the cause. Fascist groups are defined just as much, if not moreso, by internal conflict as they are by external conflict, and Antifa presents a unified and diverse front, so it is not fascist in that sense. Politically, while all Antifa leadership is expected to be members of Antifa, obviously, the organization lacks a single dominating political group. Unlike a fascist government, Antifa cells can and are often called upon to act independently of the unifying organization. Antifa doesn't really have an economy in the sense that a state does, but most of the organizations \"wealth\" is given *from* private interests *to* the organization, while a Fascist economy is defined by a strong flow *from* the organization *to* private interests. Most importantly, although Antifa is willing to fight for what they believe in, their goal is to reduce the total amount of conflict, protect groups from each other, insure personal liberty, and uplift those who have not succeeded, values that place them directly in opposition to fascist values. Therefore, we can confidently state that Antifa is not a fascist organization, although perhaps this shouldn't come as too much of a surprise, seeing as how the name Antifa is a truncation of anti-fascist.\n\nWhen discussing such high order anthropological concepts, it is equally important to state what fascism isn't as it is to state what fascism is. This is especially important for fascism, because fascism and its primary opponents, capitalist democracy and communism, share a common ancestor, the communalist philosophers and radicals of the 19th Century, and developed in common conditions and in the rejection of similar prior forms of governance. Also, fascism has been used by many politically motivated individuals and groups, creating a great deal of confusion surrounding the term, to the point where people even often confuse fascism with anti-fascist organizations.\n\nFascism is not capitalist democracy, predominantly because a capitalist democracy is constructed predominantly around the preservation of personal liberty and views conflict as an unpleasant but inevitable consequence of conflicting liberties, while fascism is built primarily around creating conflict and views personal liberty as a weakness to be extinguished. Of course, I'd be crucified by the Communists that, obviously, are quite dominate on \/r\/communism, if I didn't at least mention that, despite their differences, capitalist democracies and fascist states have cooperated more than either side might care to admit.\n\nSimilarly, fascism is not communism, because communism views conflict as an unfortunate means to the end of creating a society where equality and human decency are the paramount values and the world's diverse people are united into a singular organization dedicated to peacefully maintaining these values. Fascism, in contrast, would balk at the idea of a single united humanity, believing that humanity must be purified and strengthened in the crucible of constant conflict.\n\nFascism should also not be confused with earlier governmental systems. Unlike fascism, feudalism is defined by personal relationships and not by a singular all-powerful entity. Fascism is also not theocracy, because theocracy requires the direct domination of government by religious institutions.","created_utc":1531257487,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

This seems to lead to a process of defining fairness in very precise biological terms.

{"author":"xplkqlkcassia","body":"Yes.\n\n&gt; A critical test came when the Chinese leadership was forced to deal with the effects of the worst capitalist crisis since World War II.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the crisis hit in 2008 to 2009, many tens of millions of workers in the U.S., Europe, Japan and across the capitalist world were plunged into unemployment.\n&gt; \n&gt; China, which had dangerously allowed itself to become heavily dependent on exports to the capitalist West, suddenly **was faced with the shutdown of thousands of factories, primarily in the eastern coastal provinces and the special economic zones.**\n&gt; \n&gt; More than 20 million Chinese workers lost their jobs in a very short time.\n&gt; \n&gt; So what did the Chinese government do?\n&gt; \n&gt; We described what happened in a series of articles in Workers World entitled \u201cThe Suppression of Bo Xilai and the Capitalist Road \u2014 Can Socialism Be Revived in China?\u201d The article, published on March 27, 2012, **explained that plans drafted as far back as 2003, to go into effect in future years, were pushed forward and implemented.**\n&gt; \n&gt; We then quoted from Nicholas Lardy, a bourgeois China expert from the prestigious Peterson Institute for International Economics, **who described how consumption in China actually grew during the crisis of 2008-09, wages went up, and the government created enough jobs to compensate for the layoffs caused by the global crisis.**\n&gt; \n&gt; Said Lardy: \u201c**In a year in which GDP expansion [in China] was the slowest in almost a decade, how could consumption growth in 2009 have been so strong in relative terms? How could this happen at a time when employment in export-oriented industries was collapsing, with a survey conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture reporting the loss of 20 million jobs in export manufacturing centers along the southeast coast, notably in Guangdong Province? The relatively strong growth of consumption in 2009 is explained by several factors. First, the boom in investment, particularly in construction activities, appears to have generated additional employment sufficient to offset a very large portion of the job losses in the export sector. For the year as a whole the Chinese economy created 11.02 million jobs in urban areas, very nearly matching the 11.13 million urban jobs created in 2008.**\n&gt; \n&gt; \u201c**Second, while the growth of employment slowed slightly, wages continued to rise. In nominal terms wages in the formal sector rose 12 percent, a few percentage points below the average of the previous five years (National Bureau of Statistics of China 2010f, 131). In real terms the increase was almost 13 percent. Third, the government continued its programs of increasing payments to those drawing pensions and raising transfer payments to China\u2019s lowest-income residents. Monthly pension payments for enterprise retirees increased by RMB120, or 10 percent, in January 2009, substantially more than the 5.9 percent increase in consumer prices in 2008. This raised the total payments to retirees by about RMB75 billion. The Ministry of Civil Affairs raised transfer payments to about 70 million of China\u2019s lowest-income citizens by a third, for an increase of RMB20 billion in 2009 (Ministry of Civil Affairs 2010).\u201d**\n&gt; \n&gt; He further explained that the Ministry of Railroads **introduced eight specific plans, to be completed in 2020, to be implemented in the crisis. The World Bank called it \u201cperhaps the biggest single planned program of passenger rail investment there has ever been in one country.\u201d In addition, ultrahigh-voltage grid projects were undertaken, among other advances.**\n&gt; \n&gt; The full article by Lardy can be found in \u201cSustaining China\u2019s Economic Growth after the Global Financial Crisis,\u201d Kindle Locations 664-666, Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n&gt; \n&gt; **So income went up, consumption went up and unemployment was overcome in China \u2014 all while the capitalist world was still mired in mass unemployment, austerity, recession, stagnation, slow growth and increasing poverty.**\n&gt; \n&gt; **The reversal of the effects of the crisis in China is the direct result of national planning, state-owned enterprises, state-owned banking and the policy decisions of the Chinese Communist Party.**\n&gt; \n&gt; There was a crisis in China, and it was caused by the world capitalist crisis. T**he question was which principle would prevail in the face of mass unemployment \u2014 the rational, humane principle of planning or the capitalist market. In China the planning principle, the conscious element, took precedence over the anarchy of production brought about by the laws of the market and the law of labor value.**\n&gt; \n&gt; But the institutions based on the remaining structures of Chinese socialism, which saved the masses from economic disaster, are the very institutions that the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Wall Street and London want to reduce and eventually destroy. They are the state-owned enterprises, government planning and the control by the Chinese Communist Party.\n&gt; \n&gt; One might say that the Chinese leadership did this to avoid unrest. Surely the capitalists in Europe and the U.S. also want to avoid unrest. But that did not cause them to put tens of millions of workers back to work, raise pensions, raise stipends and social welfare payments. It only caused them to institute austerity to secure the profits of the bankers.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Coming back to Marxist analysis, it is clear from the way the Chinese leadership handled this crisis that the socialist side of the economic foundation is still dominant in China. And the same can be said for the political superstructure.**\n&gt; \n&gt; The enemies of socialism claim that capitalism is responsible for the great successes in China.\n&gt; \n&gt; But that is a falsehood. **China has succeeded in its economic development because the socialist sector has broadly contained domestic capitalism and imperialist investment within the framework of the national economic goals of the leadership.**\n&gt; \n&gt; **Without that, China would look like India \u2014 which also has planning but is  a thoroughly capitalist country.**\n\n* [Marxism and the social character of China](https:\/\/www.workers.org\/2013\/06\/13\/marxism-and-the-social-character-of-china\/)","created_utc":1531270305,"score":46,"subreddit":"communism"}

I understand why people who are from places that have been historically and culturally Muslim want to still identify as Muslim. I also know many Turkish, Albanian, Bosnian, North African, Syrian, and Palestinian Muslims and I respect the heritage.

In one idea of socialism or communism, as there are SEVERAL, but this mainly encompasses a vast majority of the ideas and actual experiments of socialism. There would be more free time because more people would be working, as there would be less unemployed. This would allow a bit more freedom to think about problems, arts, etc. It would also allow people to pursue their passion instead of a paycheck.

Lesser evilism is a historically situated phenomenon where the communist parties of Western Europe were caught between the anti-imperialist line of the Soviet Union (which was itself full of contradictions) and their mass base of labor aristocracy and thus a labor\/left party generally represented the chance of alliance governments. We know now what a failure it was but we also understand the material reasons it happened beyond \"bad theory.\" This applies less to the United States where the CPUSA was destroyed in the 50s and the national liberation movements were independent of bourgeois politics and the white working class, but it was misapplied during the end of this period as defeated leftists attempted to integrate into the Democrats, the party of slavery.\n\nNone of this applies to the age of neoliberalism because party politics have no chance of affecting imperialism or national policy. The election of SYRIZA and to a lesser extent the way Brexit is happening shows that national governments have no power and what people vote for is not relevant to what happens. More specifically, in the places with defeated communist parties, the labor aristocracy is dying and the remaining parties represent different factions of capital, making the whole concept incoherent. Who is the lesser evil between Apple and Walmart? This may touch on some social issues but ultimately they have different forms of exploitation and that's it.\n\nMass movements still exist and can force minor policy changes but the causality here does not involve voting.","created_utc":1531334016,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

As for your second commentary, voting is not an end in and of itself, merely a means to an end: universal democracy under conditions of abundance for all. Historically speaking, voting has been a way to gauge popular opinion for large decision making bodies under socialism, as the parliamentary systems of socialist countries aren't all that different than bourgeois ones in form. It's quite possible that in the future, socialism will find more sophisticated means of democratic feedback between government and population than voting, I actually think it's likely and the technology already exists. \n\nAnd just to be clear, liberals don't actually care about voting. They may say they do but when their wealth is on the line, they have much more powerful and directly democratic ways of defending their interests such as home-owner's associations, private security militias, stock holder meetings, etc. It just so happens these associations are extremely racist and not up for membership to those outside their class. \n\nYou'll have to find the Lenin quote where he says that, I would have to read the context.

I just sorta... honestly, get tired of explaining stuff and I'm not the best at explaining stuff.\n\nThings, products, are produced now (AS IN RIGHT NOW) because people are paid to make them. Because if they don't make money, they will die of starvation or be homeless. Remember this. \n\nUnder a socialist and then communist society, that fact doesn't exist. This does not mean people would just sit around doing nothing. Look at the first socialist experiment, Soviet Russia, or other socialist experiments (I say experiments because socialism, the transition phase between capitalism and communism, is not a set thing and depends on the conditions of the people\/state\/society\/world) people straight up are not lazy. Are not sitting around doing nothing. Are constantly innovating and working, even though a lot of their \"safety net\" stuff is taken care of. I point back to the many many (I can get a list if you care, but might take a bit) innovations that socialist states have done. As a space nerd, my favorite is the Soviet space missions. It's a fundamental fact that a SOCIALIST society was the first to do so many space related things (many several words about this. Again, space nerd and everything is related and needs many sentences to fully explore).\n\nAn unrealistic request coming in, but give yourself 4 weeks of doing nothing, and you'll see how bored you are and how you want to do something. Marx, roughly, has a thing about this in Kapital (which I don't recommend just jumping into; you seriously do need some background knowledge or most of what he is saying is just gonna go right over your glazed head. And I don't mean that in a mean way, he writes very dense... german translation and all, and how he goes off on necessary but seemingly irrelevant tangents... back to the everything is related even when it doesn't seem related thing from the video). \n\nUnder our current society, even just go on vacation, and if you enjoy your job (which isn't always the case under a capitalist society, sadly, many people just go towards what makes them money or what have you), you are somewhat bored of the vacation and want to go back to your day to day. Not necessarily work, but the coworkers and the like. If you enjoy your job, which is MUCH MUCH MUCH more likely under a communist society (not going to say definite, as life is life, shit happens), you'll WANT to go back to work. \n\nLast thing I'll say, as I honestly know that I'm not the most articulate and much more of a (shitty) vessel of info if someone doesn't want to produce something that you want. That's tough. People shouldn't be forced to produce something just cause someone else wants it. Just imagine the workers making a yacht (yeah, big crazy rich person thing, but you get the idea). The workers will NEVER be able to buy a yacht. Why should these people be forced to build it? Just because they are threatened (lots of words and comments about this, but I digress) to make it because they would be jobless without said job? I'm sorry if I feel a lack of empathy for the people really fighting to keep the current system just so they can get a yacht while people are starving (this is shit...ily said. But I'm kinda getting more and drunker and just want to help you understand. I implore you to go ask people with more knowledge about this shit. I'm a pretty shit Marxist-Leninist, but I have read the answers and going off memory). \n\nYou must remember that we, as communists, are trying to make a BETTER society, not a perfect one or a truly equal one, just a BETTER society. This means that you, as in YOU and everyone else, need to understand the reality that is capitalism. That's what Marx wrote about. He was a capitalism analyst. Him and Engels (who was absolutely integral to works about communism, and was a factory owner) wrote something like 99% about capitalism and 1% about socialism\/communism. \n\nI personally grew up with documentaries about how flawed capitalism and the US government was. It helped with my personal hurdle to becoming a Marxist. If you want some book recommendations to help you get a better understanding of capitalism, I can certainly help. \n\nBut if you want a better answer to your general question, I seriously hope you ask communism101.

I also believe the party I am in is a Marxist Leninist  party. Sam Webb a social democrat is no longer chair or a member in the  CPUSA. His revisionist influence and liquidationist practices while  hurting the Party tremendously did not kill it. We are going back to our  roots rebuilding the party,YCL,etc. We are in the mist of our 1st  membership drive in 10 years and we are recruiting. Yes there are still  problems of social democracy in the party ,but our side is winning. And  yes every party has a right and left wing even under Lenin and Stalin  and always will. By the way we don't and never have endorsed a  capitalist candidate. Here in Texas we ran 5 Party members for office,1  who got 250,000 votes and carried 45 counties. Another won the primary  and we hope will win in November. As you may know the CPUSA is denied  ballot status here in Texas by law ( also in several other states ). We  have 4 state legislators ,5 city council members and another 8 party  members elected at lower positions around the country. We will be  celebrating our 100th anniversary next year at our national convention  in Chicago. We are also a member of the International Meeting of  Communist and Workers Parties.

But violence, which revolution is inevitably, is a last resort once all other outcomes have been exhausted. Even Lenin spoke on the importance of taking part in bourgeois democracy to build the party's influence and power as a political body and representative vanguard for the people's interests. Will bourgeois democracy bring change? No, this is collectively agreed upon by all in the party. But is utilizing it important for the growth of the party while sticking to the ultimate goal of revolutionary overthrow? Yes. While our party holds a policy of not forcing any member to vote within our demands, the party as a whole agrees the Democrats and Republicans are nothing but governmental bodies serving the interest of the ruling class, and that supporting either or would hinder our work.\n\nIf we want to be successful, we must empower the party and grow its resources to the point it is a powerful entity to challenge the state. Otherwise anything else would weaken us as a whole and destroy our movement.\n\nAs for why you should join us, that is completely up to you. Some of the things we in the party have noticed that we do that other groups lack is: We try to supply all our comrades with ML theory, be it for cheap or free. Our party dues are as low as we can make them for members of all conditions and situations. We are constantly working, producing, organizing, etc. despite our numbers. We try to keep all cadre as active with the party as a whole as much as possible. We promote our culture (pro-soviet historical Marxist-Leninist culture) constantly. We teach new members and members who lack historical knowledge as much as we can (we have two, soon to be three, calls for educational purposes.) We try to connect cadre with other active cadre's around the nation, build bonds between comrades (the way we see it, we call ourselves comrades because we build bonds between members to build the membership in to, the best comparison, a family.)

The way I did it was that I'd read a part of capital and then go on to read a shorter Marxist book (usually something by Lenin, maybe branch out, maybe go for a more modern author), and this helped keep it fresh. I'm sure people with longer attention spans could do it without the speed bumps tho. \n\nReading Lenin without Marx, you get the impression that Lenin idolized Marx, because he often quotes Marx as his argument, which removes the complete supporting legs the argument was standing on (in Marx's text). It's important to see *why* these people are quoting Marx and Engels; both so you can understand 1.) The argument's  context and how they arrived at that conclusion, 2.)

I began to see government as a necessary evil in a world full of flawed humans.

I'm pretty convinced that Trump, and those who come after him, will seek out any loophole in law and general social discourse to gain an unfair advantage, and that if left unchecked, they will exploit these loopholes to transform our society into something monstrous.\n\nI really fear that some college student or junior military officer out there today is watching Trump, idolizing the world he wants to create, and is pledging to be President someday, and further his agenda while avoiding the mistakes Trump has made.\n\nI think that America for sure - and probably most other nations - are simply too large to represent the wishes of their myriad populace.

China\u2019s economic success couldn\u2019t have been achieved without socialism and very few countries have achieved similar within capitalism, because only a few countries can live luxuriously at the expense of the rest under a capitalist system. \n\n\\* How many lives has capitalism cost just from all the wars its necessitated to maintain it? \n\nBut you don\u2019t even have to use that metric. During the years between 1870-1914, the so called \u201c[golden age of capitalism](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Economic_history_of_the_United_States#Late_19th_century)\u201d (in the west), millions of people perished from famine just in China and [India](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Category:Famines_in_British_India) [because those economies were forcibly integrated into the west\u2019s economic system.](http:\/\/www.thecornerhouse.org.uk\/resource\/origins-third-world#index-15-00-00-00) Capitalism isn\u2019t just the west! \n\nEdit: \n\n&gt;\tthe vast majority of the wealth in the West is a product of its economic system that allowed for the basis of these luxuries to BE INVENTED and be affordable in the first place\n\nLol. Socialists have a lot to say about this as well. [Here\u2019s](https:\/\/anti-imperialism.org\/2017\/10\/04\/the-socialism-amerika-needs-now\/) a start. (On why those luxuries can be affordable, and how that comes at the expense of the capitalist countries integrated with the west\u2019s economies, on why looking at just the west\u2019s economies in a globally integrated system is your biggest false premise, etc)\n\nAll that technology that\u2019s so great can and will be invented under communism, at whatever pace. It undoubtedly will be much faster, once the better system is established** and the billions of people struggling in subsistence production because capitalism can\u2019t extend basic rights like education to them, much less luxuries***, can contribute their untapped skills and talents to scientific and technological development. In a system that strives to make the fruits of such advances truly available to all. (Capitalism can\u2019t do that. Does it look like capitalism does that? Can you honestly look at the world today, where capitalism has dominated for centuries, electricity was developed over 100 years ago, and large minorities of humanity still don\u2019t have it, and say \u201cYes, capitalism makes the fruits of technological development available to all?\u201d Can you say blind markets do that successfully based on the existing results so people shouldn\u2019t use their intelligence to cooperatively and consciously try to do better? One of marxists\u2019 biggest arguments against capitalism is that it artificially and severely restricts the development and adoption of\/access to technological development.)\n\nBesides, most new tech is invented by the government, military and research institutions, not by lone inventors or capitalists. \n\n\\** This might take \u201ca while,\u201d and there will be errors (I don\u2019t know enough about the great leap forward to qualify it as one), but it will be a brief moment in humanity\u2019s history, much like capitalism.\n\nHow long it will take remains to be seen.\n\n[This](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/4ntWbC4.jpg) was a mistake that can be learned from and modern agriculture can be improved too.\n\n\\*** Of course if the fruits of scientific development are available to all, you can\u2019t think you have \u201cluxuries,\u201d because that requires relative deprivation, ie people who don\u2019t have access to something deemed luxurious. Whether scientific and tech development would be more advanced under a system that allows for all people to develop their talents and contribute to socIal advances (not the case under capitalIsm, and this is structural) is left out of the question entirely.\n\nBut even if it was slower, which I don\u2019t think it could be, after communism has developed sufficiently, some of us still would prefer equality with maybe a slower pace of technological development (but really, one of marxists\u2019 main arguments is that capitalism greatly retards the development of the productive forces, arbitrarily\/unnecessarily. The soviet union industrialized in a much shorter time frame than capitalist economies took, for example).","created_utc":1531495189,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

After Kraus it took a couple decades for the ruling class to really harness psychoanalysis (e.g. Edward Bernays, and the rise of the \"medical model\" of behaviorism and mental hospitals), and only once \"the government\" became entirely savvy could someone like Szasz come along with his flavor of anti-authoritarianism (as you noted; the second page of the book I mentioned demonizes Stalin for \"thought control\"). So Szasz sees the ways in which liberals have violated their own libertarian code and is standing up in defense of it. So when he says \"objective science, diagnosed by physicians and objective tests\" what exactly does he mean? He is not a physician nor a dialectician so \"objective science\" is just a buzzword and his deference to the authority of organic physicians (who are of course swept up in a fraud similar to that of the psychiatrists) is a telling move.\n\nFrom what I understand anti-Freudianism has been baked into the modern ethics of psychology and while psychodynamic psychotherapy still remains a therapeutic approach, for most \"behavioral disorders\" it has largely been supplanted by CBT and its new-age offspring \"mindfulness\".

As I stated, psychology isn't my field of study, but something I'm very interested in, so most of the things you've said I've never heard before, therefore I can't make a response directly on what you said. Nonetheless, my main concern is about the whole psychiatry-mental-illness-stigmatization-control-on-working-people thing, as it is something that surrounds us in many ways (especially with more and more young people being \"diagnosed\" as mentally ill and being medicated etc.). So, the main question on this post is: is there a marxist author who analyses this in a profound way? Not simply saying \"psychiatry is bad\", but showing it's use as a tool for the dominant class, it's history (as Szasz does in the book I've mentioned), and the questionable \"science\" behind it (that actually should be a clue of it being a tool for class domination).

But in general if you have a tool for modifying your brain and it's not just a crude chemical hammer that you bathe your entire organism in, there is nothing wrong with that in principle.\n\nEven with the crude chemical tools like adhd-meds, the problem here is more that a capitalist can control the supply, and will aim to restrict it to users that generate cognitive surplus labour, and also use the dependency as chains for class domination.\n\nThomas Szasz is right about mental insane asylums being prisons and psychology functioning as, and I quote: \"sewers of society\" , but his position is just the right libertarian one of do nothing it's all natural, with that he naturalizes the psychological violence in capitalism.

When I went vegan I realized both that I didn't really know how to cook because meat, eggs, and cheese are easy, except, fortunately, for Mexican food, which is really easy to make vegan, and one of the essays I linked covers the colonial history that explains why.  This site has a lot of good recipes in that regard:  https:\/\/www.veganmexicanfood.com\/\n\nSome simple snack examples off the top of my head are taking a few bananas, slicing them up, and freezing them.  Then you blend them (with some vegetable milk if you want) with chocolate powder and you have chocolate ice cream.\n\nAnother is [this recipe](http:\/\/www.veganer.nu\/mad\/laekon-strimler\/) for vegan bacon that uses rice paper, oil, soy sauce, nutritional yeast flakes (this will become your new god, used in a lot of recipes for vegan cheeses or just adding a \"cheesy\" flavor), and liquid smoke.  You can make them in the oven or in a pan, and since they're rice paper you can store them for a long time.

{"author":"Odd_Hornet","body":"Nothing is a substitute for communism itself, and under capitalism we will always harm or exploit other people in some way, but we can't use that as an excuse to freely exploit others. What counts as being too much exploitation or not is up to each individual, but I think everyone can agree that \"no ethical consumption under capitalism\" isn't a free pass.\n\nSo, we can't decide for you whether or not consuming animal products is crossing the line; everyone has to decide for themselves how much personal convenience they're willing to sacrifice to reduce the amount of exploitation that they participate in.\n\nPut aside the treatment of animals for a moment (though there are some who consider animals to be a sort of proletariat, exploited from birth for the gain of others). Standard western diets, heavy in meat in dairy, use vastly more land and water than a vegan diet, because the animals we eat require massive amounts of food to raise them. For example, the majority of the deforestation that the Amazon rainforest has experienced is attributed to livestock production. It's much more efficient to directly eat plants than to have the nutrients consumed by animals first and then eat the animals.\n\nIf the planet belongs to everyone, and if destroying the planet for private profit is theft from all humans, then participating in such a system is a crime against everyone. Again, under capitalism we all commit these sorts of \"crimes\", but by however much you reduce your consumption of animal products, you also reduce your participation in the theft of the planets health.\n\nBut, what about vegan vs. vegetarian? For me it's not that hard to eliminate all animal products. I cook most of my own food from from scratch (lots of dry beans and rice but also other veggies). But I know that's not for everyone. (I started life basically only eating meat.) If you do what you can then the occasional \"milk powder\" listed as the 19th ingredient on the label isn't going to fuck the whole planet up. On the other hand if you're chugging gallons of dairy milk feeling great about not killing cows, remember to weigh out the amount of land required to raise crops for dairy cows and the environmental destruction caused by the methane that cows burp out.\n\nIn the end you have to be the judge and of course I'm biased in one direction, but I think it's one of those things where if you can manage to cause less exploitation and destruction then it makes sense to do so.","created_utc":1531539436,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

I don't hate Indian people, but you must realize that your government is not only right wing, it is fascist. Indian government and forces collaborate with Israel in Kashmir, I know you told me not to bring up Kashmir but you must realize that the information you get in India is extremely biased as India is a right-wing fascist country at this point. hindutva = fascism and Modi is an open hindutva. Even Pakistan does not have open islamic extremists in high level positions like India has hindu extremists in high level positions. Let me say it again, I don't hate Indian people. Indian maoist movement (naxalities) are some of the most inspiring revolutionaries alive today. Now on to the main topic, since we are talking about Balchoistan journalists in Pakistan even in the Baloch area have constantly reported and summed up the consensus that India is behind Insurgency in Balchoistan. Now for some more background information, Pakistan is made up of multiple provinces and the only thing tying them all together is; Islam, Urdu &amp; Pakistan itself. Unless you are an anarchist, there is no reason why Balchoistan should not be part of Pakistan. Historically, Balchoistan has been relatively poor due to the actual make up of the land. It is extremely HOT, dry, NO water at all and most of the land isn't even fertile. Despite that, China &amp; Pakistan have both been working to create economic prosperity in the region, it is soon to come because like I said China has invested millions and millions on the deep sea port in the Balchoistan region. This is why insurgency has flared up recently, India &amp; US are both fearful of China and it's influence in Pakistan; specifically the Balchoistan region. Bangladesh was a completely different case, you can just see by the huge land seperation that it was never going to be able to work, it wasn't even in the original proposal of Pakistan. Balchoistan should not be compared to Bangladesh. If one makes an argument of Balchoistan not being part of Pakistan then maybe Punjab, Sind and the rest of Pakistan should be separate as well; but that is only viewpoint of anarchists. \"Kulbhushan Yadav who was tasked by Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) to carry out terrorism in Balochistan, and bomb Chinese nationals in a hotel in Gwadar who were there to work on a deep sea port construction project\" India is trying really hard to fight China through proxys in this region, the more you look into it the more it makes sense. India supports the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) both with funding and armed support. Another group that is funding Baloch rebels is Israel. So the proxy is between India\/USA\/Israel vs Pakistan\/China\/Iran. \"CIA memos revealed that in 2007 and 2008 Israeli agents posed as American spies and recruited Pakistani citizens to work for Jundallah (BLA affiliate) and carried out false flag operations against Iran\" Don't forget that Balochistan shares a border with Iran which is also part of the reason why USA\/Israel attemps to de-stablize this region.

Those who CANT  work will be taken care of . Well, work will be better when it\u2019s cooperative . Die of hunger or poor health?! Listen, if your able bodied and can work you need to . That\u2019s just the way it is. If you don\u2019t want to work to improve your life there\u2019s not much anyone can do for you.  Able bodied folks who choose to rely on the charity of others for there survival might die but nobody forces anyone to make that choice . Until robots can do everything, people have to work. If they aren\u2019t able than we take care of them. The sick, the injured, the young, the disabled, and the pregnant should be taken care of and will be. The problem with people fetishizing commodities comes from people being 1) overworked and 2) alienated. Worker coops address this by shortening the work week and making work more social. The idea being that a fetishization of commodities is replaced by the fetishization of social interaction. Imagine a world where people go to a lounge to chat for an hour a day rather than going shopping . Also, your producing less and everyone gets rewarded fairly so there\u2019s less overproduction . Less overproduction or production at all means less stuff for any individual to have . \n\n\u201cI think you completely misunderstood my last question. I\u2019m not asking what\u2019s stopping leaders I\u2019m fine with that. I\u2019m talking about bad leaders. 400 years ago everyone mostly agreed slavery was cool and some races were inferior and I\u2019m not saying communism is bad because bad things can happen under it. I\u2019m saying wouldn\u2019t such a power vacuum left by a government possibly lead to a dictatorship. While community should keep society in check many communities within societies allow and push for bad things to happen. In Spain, Franco didn\u2019t abuse the Catalan people alone, he did it with the help of the people who discriminated against the Catalan.\u201d\n\nSure, theoretically that\u2019s possible. It\u2019s not really a power vacuum. The idea is that the state is replaced by workers organizations because such organizations become so strong they smash the state . Personally, I find that laughable. I think you have to do it the other way around . Anyhow, I\u2019m just not so worried about that. It seems to me that if your in a room with 10 people you\u2019ve grown up and worked with that it\u2019s harder to get 6 together to install 1 as dictator than in the current system we have .

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"Judeo-christianity is not an institution that can \"suppress\" anything, it is a series of books. Under a particular alliance between the Church as landowner\/ideological pillar of support for carrying over Roman law into the late middle ages in Western Europe and the various kingdoms which became modern nation states, a conflation of desire and reproduction started to develop for the *nobility* because the feudal mode of production in its crisis produced absolutism: a variant of the feudal mode of production in which a national ideology was produced for the first time based on the symbolic being of the royalty down to their subjects. But the level of productive forces was far too primitive for any real mass ideology, this was really limited to the classes who had rebelled against centralized power in alliance with the urban bourgeoisie as a means to change the reciprocal relations of fedualism into hierarchical ones of absolutism. But at least theoretically (which became realized under capitalism), for the first time the life of the peasant became the concern of the state rather than his corvee, supervised by autonomous lords on manors. \n\nFor peasants, the life of the medieval village was basically cut off from the rest of the world, and the ideology of the church corresponded to the economic needs of this mode of living: sex is for procreation, make as many kids as possible to do farm labor for the collective. Desire is not part of the equation. In reality, it's very doubtful that this ideology was really applied or that desire was controlled at all since a collective in which men, women, and children have to work is not very conducive to patriarchy and controlling women. In Korea for example, it was only until the late Joseon that the strict control of women that neo-confucianism is known for actually occurred and it never really applied to peasant families, although the history of the development of feudalism into capitalism is the history of women's increasing oppression to the present era of normative rape culture and violent proletarianization of billions of women. If you actually read the bible, sodomy makes no special exception for homosexuality, which was no worse than masturbation.\n\nThe concept of \"sexuality\" is a modern concept which comes out of the individualism of desire that capitalism creates, both because labor becomes individual labor power as an industrial commodity (instead of the mass collective labor of farming) and because the capitalist state had to mobilize the entire population for war and nationalism (the nation itself obviously being a creation of capitalism as a particular geographical area of free exchange protected from other national markets). In particular, it comes out a scientific rationalization of desire as a Cartesian rationalism which produced heterosexuality and its dialectical shadow homosexuality. These categories have already broken down as desire reasserts itself under neoliberalism, although this is in no way a return to the desires of peasant life. \n\nYou've already acknowledged this by using the term LGBTQ+ which is so historical that it is within living memory. Not only calling yourself queer but identifying as queer and *feeling* queer is so recent that we're not even sure what it means. LGBTQ+ doesn't really make sense since it attempts to fuse the LGBT political alliance with the queer movement which was a *critique* of the previous movement and concept and shows how abstract this all is, since what was until a decade ago a movement reviled by liberals and on the edges of radical politics has now become a badge of honor for liberals who don't know the first thing about the history or concepts being discussed (Stonewall the movie being a particularly acute example). This is not a criticism, it's a better state of affairs than a decade ago although it means the end of the LGBT alliance in my opinion. Of course, the usage of the term means that a political struggle is occurring over this very terrain, with the internationalization of LGBT providing life support (and obviously Trump is giving life support to every organization that because corrupt and bourgeois during Obama). That LGBT is not long for this world doesn't mean that it's dead now, whether the alliance can absorb intersectionality (itself a symptom of the breakdown of liberalism and its categories) will be determined by class struggle.

If everyone made under half a million a year like dentists but continued to produce than there wouldn\u2019t be any poverty.

Do you know what that gap is now? It\u2019s over 250x !!!!! Your average worker has to work all year to make what there boss makes in a day! That kind of inequality is not fathomable in a system where everyone who works owns . Whether or not people are different doesn\u2019t matter.

If they don\u2019t want to work with us there\u2019s plenty of land to work for themselves. Big difference there . I disagree. Big correlation between people who, smoke cigarettes for instance, and who work long hours. Big relationships between various consumptive activities and work hours. Well, you didn\u2019t provide an alternative explanation for commodity fetishism. I did. I want to sculpt society? Why you say that? Switch masters? What master did I switch to? I can go to the moon when I want? News to me. Now to this whole notion of normal your asserting. Why do you assert being alone is normal? Did you know that people literally go crazy if they are left alone too long? It\u2019s literally considered torture to leave people alone too long . First of all, you can\u2019t prove you know what you like. You might be brainwashed. That\u2019s what I tell the slave who said he liked slavery, of which many existed. Human beings are intrinsically social creatures and loving social relationships seem to make people happier than anything else . So that\u2019s the goal, create more loving relationships. Sorry your against love . That\u2019s what capitalism does.... For 95% of human history we were mostly social. It\u2019s only now with technology we become so alienated . Probably not good for us. \n\n\u201cWhy would you want to produce less? why would you want people to have less stuff? As long as things are produced in a non-harmful way shouldn't people get as much as they want?\u201d\n\nWell, for one, we\u2019re incredibly wasteful . If we don\u2019t produce as much we literally aren\u2019t working as much . Why? Have you seen what we\u2019ve done to the Earth? We\u2019ve only caused the greatest mass extinction that we believe has ever happened on this planet and have covered the world with plastic. Ewwwwwwww. We don\u2019t even have enough resources on this planet for everyone to have the standard of living of your average American right now. It would take 1.5 Earths if everyone wanted to live like you and me. So, to work less and save our species and others we should produce less . As much as they want , sure if it\u2019s non harmful but I dare say non harmful production is nonexistent . It\u2019s a cost benefit game always . \n\n\u201cI think under communism that dictators might be able to emerge. Not due to any moral short coming but a lack of barriers to power.

We simply have a stable country which is why the government has remained the same . Similar governments in other countries have succumbed to dictatorship because they were just less stable. I don\u2019t think you understand what Mussolini for example really stood for and he wasn\u2019t asking people to murder there best friends which is what would be required to set up dictatorship in the society I described.

No one with a sane mind would argue that Pakistan is just as or more fascist than India which is an extreme far right fascist nation. Hindu right-wing extremists is far different than an islamic republic... islamic republic does not mean islamic extremists and seem orientalist of you to conflate the two. Just search up the Indian maoists position on Pakistan, who it supports in Kashmir and Balochistan. Balochistan is Pakistan, it doesn\u2019t want or need it because it is already part of it.... every nation is built on a fluid identity. With your argument you can easily split Iran up, give sections away to Kurds in other ethnic groups. If you are a racist white and orientalist anarchist that is... India behind Israel is one of the most fasxist countries on earth. India collaborates with Israel and is a stooge of the US in the region. Actively committing genocide in Kashmir, on par with Israel in Palestine. India is far from a secular country lol, by your logic USA\u2019s constiution says that all men are equal. Weak arguments on your part. And I take the Indian maoist position on this issue as they prove themselves to be far more revolutionary than communist parties in Pakistan. muslims are being killed there everyday and genocides are going on in Kashmir. You sound right wing almost yourself. Just because there is no marxist-leninist insurgency doesn\u2019t make it invalid, what type of argument is that. Extremely orientalist. Indian maoists support the Islamic uprising in Kashmir, you sound like a hindu nationalist. Balochistan IS pakistan, lets not forget that Pakistan deserves access to their own resources along with the communist country of China who is helping them and will also be receiving benefit. Your reasonings for Balochistan are more of anarchists reasonings and can actually be applied to all of India and most of the middle east. You are directly against the self determination of Pakistan. You realize your claiming Pakistan has no right to exist because it was based on Islam right? Sounds imperialist and orientalit, you realize Pakistan was created because Muslims were a discriminated minority within India with no power right? And they still are. Iran is also an Islamic republic, will you call that fascist unlike basically all marxist-leninists whos position is to support it? Furthermore, Balochistan destablization is very similar to the beggening of the Syrian war and the attempts to destablize Syria. If you support the Syrian rebels, you are pretty fascist. If you support the Syrian government then there is no reason you should not support Pakistani government in their own self determination. Baloch insurgency is backed by ISRAEL, INDIA AND USA. there is CLEAR evidence for this, with all that being said you still choose to side with the imperialists in this matter? You still choose to undermine a nation that is closer to anti-imperialism, and ally of China &amp; Iran. Balochistan is the only buffer zone from Iran in which Israel and USA both want to surround it. China is 100% fully invested and in Blaochistan right now where it has already created one of the deepest sea ports in the world, all of this is a huge threat to India. India fascists have been trying to undermine this since it was started lets not forget, you seemed to be brainwashed by Indian propaganda.

India is committing genocide in Kashmir. And Pakistan did it in Balochistan and Bangladesh, and will repeat if Balochistan movement gets stronger. So please do not share your crocodile tears while you have already stated that Balochistan will not separate \"because Islam\".

Just that do not accuse other nations of doing wrong when you justify it when your Islamic Holy land does it.\n\n2. \"Iran is also an Islamic republic, will you call that fascist unlike basically all marxist-leninists whos position is to support it? \"\nIran is supported only in it's anti Imperial stance. But Iran IS fascist. If you find me \"all Marxist Leninist\" who support it, they should be reminded what Iranian Islamist did when they came to power - 10,000 members of the Tudeh party were imprisoned, Tudeh was purged from all the positions of ministry, and the Fascists massacred and raped hundreds. Tudeh was accused and discredited of working on behalf of \"foreign powers\", just how you accuse Baluchistan movement. Communist and socialist parties are banned in Iran. No serious communist would support Iran for it's Islamic repressive foundations. You can take a poll here and find it yourself. Go ahead, try. \n\n3. \"Baluchistan's insurgency is funded by U.S - India - Israel\". \nYes, just like all other problems of Pakistan, the Christian - Hindu - Jews are ruining your Islamic paradise. It is never because of your Bourgeoisie and their Feudal lords annexing. But when it comes to Kashmir, it is always the Bourgeoisie and Feudal lords annexing. Everyone else is \"brainwashed\". \nYou are just trying to discredit Baluchistan's secular Marxist Leninist anti exploitation movement by claiming it is being funded by capitalist powers. But, somehow, it's forced annexation, was not funded by capitalist powers. \"Because Islam\". Right.\n\n4. \" Balochistan IS pakistan, lets not forget that Pakistan deserves access to their own resources along with the communist country of China who is helping them and will also be receiving benefit.\"\nBalochistan is Pakistan in the same way Kashmir is India. They LITERALLY have the exact same history - their kings annexed regardless of the will of the population. Being dishonest about it, saying one deserve freedom while other can not, and touting it can not secede \"because Islam\", makes you an Islamist instead of a Marxist Leninist.  \n\nAnd you want me to search Indian Maoist position on Pakistan?

There is a genocide going on against Muslims in Kashmiris, IDF is training the fascist Indian army. Samething in Palestine is going on in Kashmir yet you choose to ignore it because you sympathize with right wing fascist hindu extremists. Just because some islamic fundamentalists are fighting in Kashmir doesnt undermine their struggle against genocide, just like how some islamic fundamentalists fighting in Palestine doesnt undermine their struggle against Israel. you honestly seem like a racist islamaphobe, also Indian Maoists support all resistance against Indian army in Kashmir, just look at what Ganapathy and Naxalities have to say about Kashmir. And marxist-leninists dont support US imperialism nor benefactors of US imperialism such as Rojava in Syria, &amp; Balochistan seperatist movement in Pakistan.

On Stalin's point, I think we can absolutely see the basic law of socialism taking place in China. When more people have been lifted out of poverty than anywhere else in world history, and where a Marxist education is encouraged and enforced, then this is a clear sign that socialism exists. \n\nNot only that, but China is developing technologically at a rapid pace, and its socialist production, the state sector which owns the commanding heights of the economy, is constantly improving its techniques and productive abilities.\n\n\"Today there are two basic forms of socialist production in our country: state, or publicly-owned production...\" - Stalin\n\nThis is evident in the fact that Chinese state-owned enterprises are some of the most successful in the world. \n\nWith Lenin's quote we see that the Communist Party of China absolutely controls the capitalist class. Their ability to make profit can only be done so within the context of China's national plans, and in tandem with the development of socialism. Unlike any other country, capitalists are executed for not only criminal activity, but for activities which undermine socialist development. Yes, there is a danger that the capitalists can take the upper hand, but at the moment the CPC dominates political power, and whether or not they need to improve in various ways, ARE the advanced detachment of the Chinese proletariat.","created_utc":1531583606,"score":18,"subreddit":"communism"}

They are driving us towards a profit motive by compromising all of our community safety nets.

Through avarice the capitalist class continue working long after all their needs are met. For them, the profit is tangible and the need is abstract. Most of the rest of us work until our needs are met. If we get a massive raise, the very first thing most of us do is reduce the number of hours we work.

Just because a company isn\u2019t working for profit doesn\u2019t mean that every non-in the mines-miner job will disappear.

{"author":"vacuousaptitude","body":"Profit isn't an incentive to do things well, thoroughly, efficiency, or compassionately. \n\nProfit is an incentive to do things chesply, as quickly as possible, externalizing as many costs as possible, and taking advantage of people by charging the highest prices possible. \n\nYou can use examples such as for profit prisons. While all prisons are rather fucked up, this one sort of prison makes money off of the denial of fundamental liberty. They lobby for laws and manipulate social attitudes to ensure that there is a steady stream of commodities by which to make further money. And don't mistake what anyone says, prisoners are the commodity in this exchange not the customer. You're the customer. I'm the customer. The state is the customer. The public is the customer. Because it is our money that pays for these businesses to hold our \"dangerous commodities\" away from us for an agreed upon time. In the meanwhile they enslave them and make profit off their labour as well.\n\nFactory farms are something not even the most ardent carnist is in support of and they are the absolute epitome of what the profit motive results in. They commodify not just a life but the perpetual genetic lineage of that life. Sentient creatures mutilated in mass at break neck speeds to ensure they are less potentially harmful. Then held in vile disgusting cages and fed vague nutrient slurries. Their feces sits in untreated lakes, or is aerosolized and spread across the ground to disperse it. The animals are slaughtered without concern, and even health and safety inspectors are given such little time to inspect the corpses that they are routinely doused in disinfectant to hopefully mitegate disaster. Workers in these industries have vastly higher rates of injury, mental illness, and PTSD than even soldiers deployed in combat zones. \n\nFor profit education is another great example. Many for profit schools had to shut down because the profit motive encourgaed them to illegally charge different students different amounts for the same services, hire underqualified and underpaid instructors, and trap the students in a loop of perpetual tuition payments without being able to obtain a real degree. \n\nFor profit medicine is also a great example if you speak to someone from any country but America. Americans, however, are preposterously defensive about the subject to the degree that they suggest waiting in line for treatment is worse than never getting that treatment because you couldn't afford it. \n\nAlmost anything done for profit is just horrible. It's inefficient. It allocates resources in the way that makes the most money, not the way that best serves the workers, the consumers, or the society. The externalization of costs alone should be the death nail in the argument that a profit motive is useful. ","created_utc":1531620171,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"randomweirdtrivia","body":"It could be a bad sign, but TBH I wouldn't overreact to this.  It mostly seems to be bringing what already exists into the legal framework.  From the article:\n\n&gt;That could mean enhanced legal protections for Cuba's fledgling entrepreneurs, and foreign investors, even though Granma said the constitution reaffirmed that central planning and state enterprise are the pillars of the economy overall.\n\nThe entrepreneurs (and some foreign investors) are already there, this just brings them more under the state's legal framework.  In a people's state menaced by imperialism, small producers outside the legal framework and supervision of said people's state can be very dangerous- the case has been made, IMO convincingly, that the economic base in the USSR for revisionism and capitalist roading was the underground \"second economy\" that lay outside the state legal framework and supervision.  \n\nAs for foreign investors, they have some legal protections in China too, and if you're pro-China as I and many others here are I don't think you should be afraid of this change in Cuban law.  With US attempts to isolate Cuba ramping up again under Trump, this seems like an unfortunate but necessary concession to me.\n\nAs a long aside on what happened in the USSR, anti-revisionists\/principled Marxist-Leninists in the post-WWII Soviet era kept trying again and again to come up with a solution for the problem of the second economy- and this was at the heart of the post-WWII class struggle in the USSR. Zhdanov's Leningrad reforms were an early attempt (and it's possible that because of that he was poisoned by the revisionists, led by Khrushchev, who then manufactured the Leningrad affair to eliminate Zhdanov's ML followers in the city, only leaving alive the revisionist Kosygin.  Beria got blamed for the Leningrad affair later, which doesn't hold up to any scrutiny at all because Beria was off in Kazakhstan devoting all of his time to the atomic bomb project when it happened.) \n\nBeria in his turn had various ideas for how to solve this problem, possibly some kind of second NEP (which later got bastardized into his supposed comment that \"the USSR can only succeed if we have private property\" which he probably never said), so the revisionists' (again with their base in the second economy\/black market economy) first order of business after Stalin died (possibly by poisoning at the hands of the revisionists, I'm not 100 percent sure of this but [Bill Bland](https:\/\/espressostalinist.com\/2014\/12\/19\/bill-bland-the-doctors-case-and-the-death-of-stalin\/) lays out compelling circumstantial evidence) was to eliminate Beria and his strongest supporters after an intense struggle over a few months. Decades later (Brezhnev was essentially a compromise leader between the Khrushchevites and anti-revisionists since by 1964 Khrushchev could no longer be allowed to continue as leader by anyone after his repeated failures), Andropov and Chernenko had ideas they wanted to implement to deal with the second economy problem, but they both died and then Gorbachev took over.  \n\nGorbachev was often described as one of the \"children of the 20th Congress\" aka the people influenced by Khruschev's \"Secret Speech\" aka influenced by his regurgitation of anti-Stalin propaganda onto a revisionist, capitalist road, only far worse than Khrushchev could dream of.   Khrushchev didn't outright want capitalism back, but he was a crypto-Trotskyite revisionist (by his own admission he was a Trotskyist early on and IMO never stopped being one in the most important ways).  His ideological heir Gorbachev went much further down the capitalist road into being an outright anti-communist, in his own words \"My aim was to liquidate communism, my ideal is the path of social democracy.\" Gorbachev's perestroika was sold to the Soviet people as an attempt to solve the probem of the second economy, but what it actually did was lead to the second economy taking over, with Yeltsin finally making it official and restoring capitalism outright.","created_utc":1531622634,"score":59,"subreddit":"communism"}

It doesn't help that a lot of them are Trots. Most British communists don't care about communism so much as owning the libs\/revisionists\/other groups to feed their ego. \n\n&gt;The problem with the CPB is that they seem to be more revisionist and campaign in favour of the Labour Party, which flies in the face of the teachings of Marx and Lenin\n\nOn second thought, you look like you'd fit in perfect. By the way, Lenin advocated the communist party supporting Labour.\n\n\n&gt;Great Britain must act on scientific principles. Science demands, first, that the experience of other countries be taken into account, especially if these other countries, which are also capitalist, are undergoing, or have recently undergone, a very similar experience; second, it demands that account be taken of all the forces, groups, parties, classes and masses operating in a given country, and also that policy should not be determined only by the desires and views, by the degree of class-consciousness and the militancy of one group or party alone.\nIt is true that the Hendersons, the Clyneses, the MacDonalds and the Snowdens are hopelessly reactionary. It is equally true that they want to assume power (though they would prefer a coalition with the bourgeoisie), that they want to \u2018rule\u2019 along the old bourgeois lines, and that when they are in power they will certainly behave like the Scheidemanns and Noskes. All that is true. But it does not at all follow that to support them means treachery to the revolution; what does follow is that, in the interests of the revolution, working-class revolutionaries should give these gentlemen a certain amount of parliamentary support. To explain this idea, I shall take two contemporary British political documents: (1) the speech delivered by Prime Minister Lloyd George on March 18, 1920 (as reported in The Manchester Guardian of March 19, 1920), and (2) the arguments of a \u2018Left\u2019 Communist, Comrade Sylvia Pankhurst, in the article mentioned above.","created_utc":1531665289,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

System of a Down and Testament are known to advocate for Social Justice Issues, System of a Down (Alternative Metal) focusing on the Armenian Genocide and Testament (Bay Area Thrash Metal) on the plight of the american natives, owing to both bands lead singers coming from those backgrounds. Testaments Album \"Practise what you preach\" is a scathing critique of America. In keeping with Thrash Metal, the Band \"Sacred Reich\" is basically all about critizising America, and songs like \"Surf Nicaragua\" evoke a kind of Dead Kennedys vibe in the writing.\n\nKeeping with the Theme of Trash Metal, German Thrash Metal bands like Kreator, Sodom and Destruction are usually good for this, we germans pride ourselves on our anti-fascism. If we aren't priding ourselves on our fascism that is.\n\nIn the Realm of Industrial Metal we have Ministry and KMFDM, wich are very lefty, and a more modern Band is Otep, wich I recently got the pleasure to discover, and the lead singer is also very lefty.\n\nHonorable mention goes to Arch Enemy (Swedish Melodeath), and Napalm Death (Grindcore)\n\nI know these aren't exactly Workers Unite! kinda hard communist bands but atleast I can attest to their musicianship :D","created_utc":1531681024,"score":14,"subreddit":"communism"}

A person with severe clinical depression can literally be too depressed to kill themselves. They cannot muster up the energy to act on their strong negative emotions. Now, when SSRIs start working, they alleviate the apathy before they alleviate the negative emotions. You can probably think of what the danger in that is. \n\nThe answer to that isn't necessarily to stop using SSRIs for treatment, as they can be extremely helpful for responders to them. Instead, we would need close monitoring of people put on them for the initial phase and regular checkups if the treatment is continued after that. Of course, under capitalism and especially without socialized healthcare, this would be way too costly to get implemented or for less wealthy people to afford.\n\nSSRIs can save lives, however, don't knock 'em off. \n\nYou want to know the reason that a lot of school shooters are on anti-depressant medication? They are usually depressed and also otherwise psychically troubled. If they weren't, they usually wouldn't commit such atrocities. Also, if you have any source that [all these](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States)(after SSRIs hit markets, of course) school shootings were perpetrated by people on SSRIs, I'd like to see it.

Not only are AOC or Sanders not the only self procalimed socialists to be elected to congress, the \"Overton window\" (honestly a bullshit idea) has not been moving any more left today than it has been.\n\n Reactionaries are in control of the majority of the US' government from local township\/city councils all the way up to the federal level. Nothing is moving anymore left than it has been. \n\nAnd that \"window\" has been shifting far longer than the 80s, and it's not due to politicians, it's due to the material conditions faced by the people living under capitalism. The further the conditions deteriorate the more radicalized people will become and it will have nothing to do with social democrats that have been elected to government.\n\n&gt; Radical communists have literally no place to stand in the electoral system as it is right now in the US. This is our best bet.\n\nCould it be that we live under a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and no number of social democrats could change that and make it viable for a communist to be granted a position of power? What is a social democrat our best bet for? To perpetuate imperialism and a dominant capitalist system that oppresses workers at home and abroad?\n\n&gt; But when it comes to bougie electoral politics, I'm 100% behind social democrats like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nI feel like I'm taking crazy pills here. What is Marxism if not a methodology by which we analyze the past to help us understand our present? Why are we so quick to ignore the lessons learned by people who struggled before us and then go out and repeat the same mistakes, waste time, stunt revolutionary potential doing the exact same shit? It's like repeatedly touching a burning stove to figure out if fire is hot. Learn the fucking lesson!\n\n\nFrom Lenin:\n\n&gt; But the danger of Kautskyism (Bernie-ism) lies in the fact that, utilising the ideology of the past, it endeavours to reconcile the proletariat with the \u201cbourgeois labour party\u201d, to preserve the unity of the proletariat with that party and thereby enhance the latter\u2019s prestige.\n\nYou are only going to blunt our efforts and be directly responsible for the suffering of real working people if you spend time defending or being a proponent of any Democrat.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/lenin\/works\/1916\/oct\/x01.htm\n\n","created_utc":1531683837,"score":16,"subreddit":"communism"}

You are not radicalized, you are literally supporting and defending your support of imperialists. With no receipts at all besides your own anecdotal evidence you are ascribing the rising tide of radicalization with Bernie Sanders and AOC which insanely ignorant of literally ALL AMERICAN HISTORY.\n\nWe aren't living a unique moment, trying to get you to understand that is like pulling teeth. My god. Progressive politicians have come and gone and the people have never radicalized with their comings and goings, they have radicalized with the material conditions of the existence alone. That is it, that is how it has always been. Bernie Sanders and AOC are opportunists taking advantage of growing unrest to redirect revolutionary potential from the masses and blunt it to a reconciliation with capital. I do not owe them shit and to say so is fucking ignorant of political history and theory.\n\n\n&gt; The very success of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez is what even affords you the space to make any of this criticism against them\n\nThis makes no fucking sense. Listen to me, the proletariat have never been radicalized by 1. A social democrat or 2. Any fucking politican. They politicians were enabled by the people because the people were radicalized themselves. Eugene Debs didn't radicalize the people, he raised a true class consciousness and pointed them in the right direction, he stood up by the strength of the people, not the other way around. The people are restless and we are inching up on a revolutionary moment, they need education and for the class consciousness to be raised. Bernie Sanders and AOC are false consciousness, and once you've convinced the masses that they are their salvation they will not be moved any further. \n\nIF YOU CONVINCE THE WORKERS TO VOTE DEMOCRAT, THEY WILL VOTE DEMOCRAT, they're not going to follow your end and join IWW (though it seems to have done shit-all for your political education) The fucking end.\n\n\nYou're still defending a social chauvinist and imperialist by the way, it's still fucking sick.","created_utc":1531692104,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"caribeno","body":"Here is some advice for people trying to convince DSA and social Democrats on why they should not vote for Democrats or follow them. People in the USA have no reference, historical or otherwise and are not book studied in a historical academic enough manner to understand how this political system functions.  Even if you lay out the example of  Rosa Luxemburg that is not going to be enough to convince most Americans.\n\nYou might try giving them  something much closer to their history and false consciousness.  We need an academic program that can actually do what the DSA people tell us they can actually achieve and that is turn Bernie, Chapo Trap House and AOC fans and voters into socialists who directly stand on principle for the overthrow of capitalism as the system which dominates people, animals and planet.  You might try the following rhetoric and explain to them how the Democrat Party took supporters of real opposition to capitalism and turned them into Democrat voters who believed they could transform the Democrat party.   Try the following -\n\nFranklin Delanor Roosevelt was a Democratic Socialist!!!!     \/putrid lie\n\nFranklin Delanor Roosevelt was a capitalist doing the bidding of large capital and the filthy rich and plain rich classes. Americans and anglo-phones cant apply the lesson or even understand Rosa Luxembourg. Even if they do they will still believe \"this time is different\".  Or say \"we have no choice we must popularize the name of socialism.\"  I don't discount what they say they want to do, just their strategy of entryism in a capitalist party that calls itself \"big tent\",  because we know that in that big tent capitalism rules. 2016 should prove to people that not even social democrats like Bernie stand a chance in the Democrat Party, not at this stage. I hope this kind of language will help convince and explain to people what is  the overwhelming probability of what happens when people turn to Democrat. You might also ask them to explain why this time will be different in their view. What proof do they have that we, who have historical proof, may have overlooked. The answer is in all probability - nothing.","created_utc":1531696387,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Neophytecomrad","body":"A libertarian is going to argue two things primarily first is the free market. They will try to differentiate between true capitalism and crony capitalism. So you need to be able to make the audience understand they are one and the same, to accomplish this you can draw from das kapital about the nature of capital and use historical examples to drive the point home. I don't mean quote Marx at the audience but you must understand what capital does so you can accurately describe why the free market is a myth, why capital accumulation is inevitable, how this leads to lobbying and peeling back regulations, etc. You also need to offer the alternative of the planned economy and how it is not prone to crisis and how it benefits society.\n\nThe second big issue that a libertarian will raise is that of personal liberties and how the spooky big brother communist government wants to dictate every aspect of your life. So again you must be able to apply a Marxist analysis to this concept and destroy it as the nonsense it is. Make the audience understand that socialism equals MORE democracy, and be sure they understand the distinction between private and personal property. If the issue of free speech is raised you better understand the concept of the marketplace of ideas, and how if it had any merit things like Nazi rhetoric would have vanished by now, and that the Marxist position on speech is one centered around material reality and as such unscientific ideologies like white supremacy are silenced. Where the marketplace of ideas fails, Marxism steps in. \n\nFinally just a few points to consider when in the debate if automation comes up. DO NOT HARP ON ABOUT AUTOMATING UNDESIRABLE WORK. It's not a solution people can realistically picture because certain \"shitty\" jobs are far away from being automated. Instead talk about how the progression of automation under a free market system means people have their jobs yanked out from under them the moment the work is cheaper to automate, so automation harms the people. Under a planned economy automation as it progresses reduces the necessary labor burden on the entire population. Say a society has 10 members and in order to keep those members in material comfort 100 hours of necessary labor is required per day. Each member then that work ten hours, then a breakthrough in automation occurs reducing the labor burden to 80 hours so each member then only works eight hours a day, then another breakthrough drops the necessary labor burden to 20 hours so that then each member only has to work two hours per day. In this way technological advancement is to be celebrated as it lightens the load of everyone.

{"author":"throwawayacctcommie","body":"In my opinion, it is an error to blame all communist organizations in the West for the failure of revolution. Sure, many of them (perhaps most of them) are quite horrible, but ultimately that is not the problem.\n\nThe populations of the Western countries simply *do not* want communism. Many groups chalk this up to some kind of mass delusion; people are suffering under 'False Consciousness' or they are fooled by the never-ending stream of anti-communist propaganda.\n\nBut if you look at the pattern of successful communist revolutions, you will see they *always* come about by a successful combination of *nationalism* with Marxism-Leninism. Everywhere communists have succeeded is because of this, and when the *nationalists* no longer want anything to do with Marxism-Leninism, it collapses with almost no fight whatsoever (witness Albania, Mongolia, the Eastern Bloc, etc), or goes down in a sea of separatist violence (Yugoslavia).\n\nIf Marxist-Leninist parties aren't trying to either win over the nationalists of their nations, they are ultimately doing nothing more than trying to rise to the top of a labor bureaucracy, a game which is completely rigged against them, and even if they won, would mean very little. A serious communist organization has to be capable of forming a *military apparatus* independently of any attempts to win control over labor organizations. And basically *every* Western communist group, even the ones that say they *want* to do this, have no clue how to go about creating one, and moreover, are looking to the absolute *wrong* groups of people to attempt to recruit into doing violence.","created_utc":1531751391,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Shipless_Captain","body":"Well as others have pointed out, human nature is not universal and can be changed fairly easily if the morals of society and general education change. In a capitalist society, greed does often become a part of human nature because you're taught that you can never have enough, etc. Capitalism is a culture of greed, that is why it would seem to be part of human nature under capitalism. In capitalism, greed is worshiped. People like CEOs, wealthy company owners, celebrities, etc. are looked at as being awesome people just because they've gained a ludicrous sum of wealth that no one ever could possibly need, even though they've accumulated that wealth through exploitation. This whole Kylie Jenner thing is a great example of that. \"OMG SHE ALMOST HAS A BILLION DOLLARS!!!\" Honestly it pisses me off so much to see capitalist greed worshiped like that.\n\nFurthermore, just because it's \"in human nature,\" which like I said is total BS, does not mean that it's good, or should try to be changed. For example, violence, it could be argued, is part of human nature. People used to go to public executions and tournaments to the death between people and animals just for fun.

{"author":"TheSutphin","body":"&gt;&gt;TV: How does being a communist impact your view of the U.S. presidency, whether it's Obama or Trump?\n\n&gt;AS: If you've got politics which are left of social democracy, it implies that you've got an understanding that the economic platform used by Obama, which was [also] advocated by Clinton, did dispossess a great many Americans, and this isn't just the \"white working class\" everyone loves to talk about in relation to Trump.\nThose who have suffered the most are working-class Americans of color. To me, having those politics means that you can look at economic problems without making it identity politics in the way that Trump has. Also, being a communist means being a fierce critic of the prison industrial complex and the military industrial complex. The expanded use of drone warfare and the expansive use of deportation under Obama. You can be a vocal critic of all those things, while also looking at how Trump [has done them] because, quite simply, he was able to build on a lot of Obama's legacy, particularly in terms of executive overreach. He's been able to pursue extreme, draconian forms of state violence.\nI also think that Obama represented a possibility of change, of weakened forces of racism in America \u2014 pretty meaningful. I'm not going to be someone who's going to discredit his legacy entirely.\n\n&gt;&gt;TV: You mentioned the economic platform, and the prison industrial complex, and the military industrial complex. Are there any other big, big policies \u2014 of either or both Trump or Obama \u2014 that are at odds with communist beliefs?\n\n&gt;AS: I believe that nothing so arbitrary as money should be able to come between a person and the means of survival. And that's a really fancy way of saying that it doesn't matter if you're poor \u2014 you should have top-quality health care. There shouldn't be a barrier between rich and poor in terms of the kind of health care that they can access.\nUnder Obama, you had the attempt at expanding universal health care, which was a huge step forward for the United States, but ultimately it didn't win the argument of ideology.\n[Obama] didn't win on that level, which is why I think Obamacare repeal was always in the cards. It didn't win over hearts and minds in the way that the NHS [does]. Everyone in the U.K. basically has to agree that it's a social good, free at the point of access.\n\n&gt;&gt;TV: Is that the biggest barrier to advancing leftist and communist policy positions? Is it a question of hearts and minds?\n\n&gt;AS: Saying that there should be universal health care, which is paid for by taxation, isn't necessarily a communist point of view, right? It's not even necessarily a socialist point of view. In the U.K., that's a pretty soft social democratic position.\nA communist argument \u2014 which neither Trump nor Obama or Theresa May or Macron or anyone currently is looking at \u2014 is the crisis represented by the automation of labor. Bringing manufacturers back to the Rust Belt in the United States is like, \u2018Well, those jobs are all done by robots now.\u2019 Those aren't going to be the kinds of factories that can keep whole towns alive. That's just not the case anymore.\n\n&gt;Human labor cannot compete with fixed capital \u2014 that's just a fact. In the U.K., one in five jobs is going to be automated. What does that mean? Does that mean one in five people is then excluded from the means of survival because they can no longer afford to feed themselves [or] house themselves?\nThe political model that\u2019s needed to [deal] with \u2014 the idea of surplus disposable population \u2014 is fascism. So technology can represent the oncoming of an incredibly authoritarian and violent means of controlling that serf-level population.\n\n&gt;Or \u2014 and this is the fun communism bit \u2014 you say, \u2018OK, technology, which Marx calls fixed capital in The Fragment on the Machine, has a contradictory element because on the one hand it makes you more precarious as a worker. On the other hand, it shows what you can be when liberated from work because you've got all this extra time. You can imagine different ways of living. You can pursue your passions. You can live a happy life.\u2019 Why don't we just bring that technology into common ownership? Ownership of the people, not the capitalist class, and distribute the abundance generated by that fixed capital equitably.\nAnd there are different ways of distributing that more equitably. That's possible under social democracy through taxation or universal basic income. It's possible under socialism. But communism is the only thing which says all things should be brought into the hands of commons to benefit all people. In the past, you'd call that communism. I think in the future, we'll have to call that common sense.","created_utc":1531754386,"score":64,"subreddit":"communism"}

Capitalism was, relevantly a new-ish thing. For most places, outside of the West, feudalism and it's grip still had some kind of hold. \n\nWhen both Engels and Marx said that capitalism was a necessary step, they meant that you almost definitely could not go from feudalism to socialism. \n\nSince then, the USSR happened, and that was one of the points of NEP, no? To bring about small amounts of capitalism, then push towards a socialist society, as Russia wasn't a full on capitalist society, nor strictly feudalist before the revolution. This allowed the party to oversea and restrict capitalism, then pretty much eliminate it after the NEP. \n\nChina is also an example of this, having played the middle ground of socialism and capitalism, then pushing towards a new way, socialism with Chinese characteristics.\n\nAll that said.

The keynote speaker was Senator Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii). Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey and Senator Edmund S.

To answer your question, it was by no means a death sentence. There are some statistics of the mortality rate of prisoners. The rate peaked at 25% in 1942 and was at 22% in 1943, which likely has more to do with the war and the resources available for feeding the prisoners. Most of the other years the mortality was under 10%, and under 1% in the later years. The total official number of deaths in the GULag from 1930 - 1956 is 1.6 million (Source: \u0421\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043c \u041e\u0423\u0420\u0417 \u0413\u0423\u041b\u0410\u0413\u0430 (\u0413\u0410\u0420\u0424. \u0424. 9414)).

Another is returning resources back to the colonized and oppressed.  That could mean for example removing American business interests from Africa and the global south entirely.  \n\nOne other is returning stolen land to the indigenous nations and Mexico.  Another would again be the abolishment of ICE and even CIA and FBI.  Essentially, it can be summed up at the white settler nation surrendering EVERYTHING for something else.  Usually colonized self determination and white integration into a new global order where white privilege and colonialism is abolished and replaced with a pluralist peoples' democracy led by the colonized working class.  The IMPORTANT thing to consider in this instance is that the white working class would work in tandem and under the command of the colonized working class.  This is essentially a demand for the labor aristocracy to commit class suicide and truly join the global working class.\n\nBooks by Omali Yeshitela are a good start on what decolonization means for America at least.

{"author":"RedactedCommie","body":"David Glantz is a good author\/historian to start with. Despite being a liberal he avoids injecting his own moralistic opinions into his works and he also sources virtually every claim he makes. Best of all he makes sure to tell the reader the faults of using Nazi sources. \n\nHis works are almost entirely focused on Soviet military structure with his most famous works being on the Red Army of WW2 specifically. He may be a liberal that fought for imperialism but he holds the idea of knowing your enemy to heart and as a result he has a great deal of respect for the Soviets. \n\nAnyways of all his works his number one book is \"When Titans Clashed\" which is a comprehensive overlook on how the Soviet military grew from it's days of being a light infantry force that mobilized via trains in the Russian civil war to pioneering warfare as a highly mobile and organized force in WW2. The glossary of the book also comes with list of Soviet organizational structure, official reports on causalities and troops movements from the Soviet archives, and other cool bits of information. \n\nIf you're a tank enthusiast like myself I also recommend Steven Zalogas books. He's known for his very specific and comprehensive works on various tanks. While my favorite is \"armored thunderbolt\" (what can I say I love Sherman tanks and so did the Soviets) he also has books dedicated to the T-54\/55, T-64. T-72, and T-90. While I havn't read his T-90 book the title cover seems to say it's more about the tanks service in the Russian federation and not the Soviet Union. That said I wouldn't doubt it has some Soviet army history in it (The T-90 has some interesting Soviet history. For example it used to be designated T-72BU but was supposedly renamed due to Saddam's losses of T-72s in 1991 giving the T-72 a bad rep).

{"author":"HeyNomad","body":"Here's the briefest picture I can come up with of how I think about communism. It's motivated by a hope for a more egalitarian and democratic society. That hope is reflected in two core features: (what is now called) capital being held collectively and participatory, democratic decision-making in all aspects of social life. I think those are the two most straightforward and essential features of communism.\n\nThere are some important things I see as implied by my definition, things that will necessarily stem from those two features. For one, I see them leading to the disappearance of the state, which many (myself included) think is an important part of communism. For another, I think they imply the radical transformation, if not the disappearance, of the market as a distribution mechanism. \n\nI have some ideas about what kinds of institutions might replace these things, but in many ways I don't have a very specific blueprint of what communism will look like, or at least I try not to be too attached to a particular model. When you're talking about structural, systemic transformation, I think things usually won't turn out exactly as you planned; some things can only really get worked out in the process. I also haven't said anything about how I think these things might come about, but that's kind of a different question.\n\nSo that's what I've got.

This is, furthermore, dictated by the market\u2014that is, to create the most profitable scenarios for the credit union, since while CUs aren\u2019t beholden to shareholders like larger banks, they still have to turn up dividends to survive, especially when in competition with other consumer banks\/credit unions. Thus, despite calling themselves \u201cnot-for-profit,\u201d they\u2019d still repossess your home if you can\u2019t make your appropriate loan payments. Also, in order to attract their predominantly petty-bourgeois consumer base\u2014which they especially rely on given the lack of any other sources of investment\u2014they make it a point for employees to advertise and sell as many services as possible to members\/customers. Workers under capitalism cannot be paid nor can they own the full value of the services they sell (there would be no profit then), so had employees owned and operated the assets of the CU, they would run into the problem of limiting the pool of money they would distribute back to members\u2014in other words, production costs would become too high to sustain the CU as a firm. Ironically, the only times I\u2019ve heard that the broad membership base is consulted (via yes-no referendum) are cases where the CU transforms into a bank, which they tend to do when they grow large enough. In short, despite the apparent consumer appeal of \u201cmember ownership,\u201d the contradiction between labor and capital persists and forms the very existence of a credit union.","created_utc":1531974384,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"randomweirdtrivia","body":"Putin is the representative of the Russian national bourgeoisie, the ones who get their wealth primarily from domestic resource extraction. Yeltsin was the archetypal comprador capitalist puppet, and he of course fucked Russia so badly there was a real danger of either a socialist restoration or the US just outright destroying the country a la Yugoslavia (the most extreme American neocons like Dick Cheney were openly pushing this). Even most Russian capitalists didn't want that.  So an arrangement was made where Yeltsin and his faction gave up most of their power. Yeltsin himself got immunity, but some of the most outright comprador capitalists were made an example of (Khodorkovsky), and in general it was agreed that the national capitalists would now have the leading position of the Russian state.  This meant an end to the most outright rapacious exploitation of the 90s - with the expropriation of some of the comprador oligarchs and the 00s commodities boom, the national capitalists could afford to increase general living standards and rebuild some of the old welfare state.\n\nPutin initially wanted to continue to cooperate with the US, and did, to western praise.  George W. Bush famously \"looked into his soul\" and his press secretary Ari Fleischer heaped praise on Putin for how he helped America in Afghanistan post-9\/11.  But America's aggressive imperial advance in Iraq (Putin was friendly with Saddam) and crucially, the continuous eastward expansion of NATO made Putin and his supporters grow distrustful of the US and turn increasingly towards China, who they viewed as a more reliable business partner due to their policy of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs (or, to put it another way, respect for nations' self-determination).\n\nObama's so-called \"reset button\" with Russia was all about rebuilding ties with the more western-friendly wing of Russian capitalists (represented by Medvedev), and pulling Russia into the US orbit away from China and Iran.  This might have worked, and indeed Medvedev did sign on to sanctions against Iran. However, the most hardline neoconservative wing of US imperialists (represented in this case by Hillary's State Department) got too greedy and pushed for a full Russian color revolution in the 2011 protests.  They were also the most aggressive group of US imperialists spearheading the destruction of Libya (together with the British and especially the French), in spite of Obama's assurances to Medvedev that the US wouldn't seek total regime change there.  \n\nThese things really scared the national capitalists in Russia. So Putin was brought back in 2012, the \"reset button\" was toast, and hostilities between the two countries has only increased since then.","created_utc":1531976229,"score":47,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"phonetwophone","body":"Thank-you for your first hand account.\n\nBased on what you said I don't really see the appeal of credit unions from a socialist perspective. Since as I understand at the core of socialist thought is worker ownership &amp; management of the means of production. Not membership\/consumer ownership &amp; management of the means of production. Also, like you said it appears the members\/depositors don't really manage much since most decisions are made by the managerial class at the credit union branch.\n\nIt would be nice to see maybe a hybrid credit union. Where the credit union membership is only offered to worker(s) owned and managed enterprises and that the workers at the credit union branch like yourself who spend 40hrs a week there also own and manage the credit union branch having different voting rights compared to the members since you and other workers at the credit union branch devote you time and energy to operating the credit union branch in way disproportionate to what a member ever could or does.\n\nAlso, what is your definition of petty-bourgeois? My understanding is this be another name for a small business. I don't really have an issue with a small worker owned and managed businesses. Correct me if I'm wrong but when you talk about petty-bourgeois your referring to a small business that would hire more labour as an employee. So class division would still be present.

{"author":"GaryDCLXVI","body":"Though small-business owners fall into this category, I refer to those who are not exploited enough to be considered proletarian nor own enough to be considered bourgeois. For example, someone who owns a managerial position and earns a relatively high salary, sustained for them by working at a company that distributes cheap goods produced by super-exploited labor outside Western countries, would fall under what I refer to. In my CU, for instance, it\u2019s not uncommon for members to hold tens of thousands of dollars in assets, live in relatively large suburban homes, and subsist on a fairly comfy living standard, though not necessarily own a small business.\n\nA hybrid credit union, should such a thing exist, I think would immediately run into the problem of continued growth. CUs rely on a constant influx of new members if they wish to serve a large number of people, or else they wouldn\u2019t have the expanding assets to guarantee back to members in the form of interest\u2014that is, they need to sell as many services as possible to reinvest the surplus gathered from their workers into capital (the continued sale of services). Something serving exclusively worker-managed enterprises begins in a niche that would hinder such profit, and in turn, sustainability. Granted, it sounds nice, but this is just another example of how capitalism, as a profit-based system, creates problems for itself that limits workers to operating under exploitative conditions.","created_utc":1531980524,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

That is the **real** freedom that most members of LGBT communities are blinded to seeing. \n\nThe very social conditioning that fills the public with hate of those who are different is nothing more than a product of corporations needing oppressed classes to in-fight to prevent revolution.","created_utc":1532023515,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

No one held power in their government without the consent of those below them. The Communist view of democracy is different in nature than the particular view of liberal democracy that is embedded in our society today, but there absolutely were fair elections.\n\nThe other problem in people's views of the Soviet Union is that they can't imagine an overlap between democracy and an increase in repression and use of legal violence. We know that the capitalist governments are extremely violent and we are complicit in it every day, but our view of the way that a socialist state can repurpose our institutions in order to serve the majority over the minority has been hand crafted by the bourgeoisie in order to be seen as a \"dictatorship\". Dictatorship of the working class is what they stand against. Capitalists and other parasites are made out to be victims every time, when we know all too well, either from our experience or from knowledge of history, that they are the ones who consistently stand against democracy and sovereignty.\n\nAs for the supposed genocide, the majority of sources on the number of deaths and cause of the famine stem originally from Nazi-associated Ukrainian fascists, who, taking advantage of the famine, organized revolts against the collective farms and destroyed state property in order to exacerbate the famine and undermine Socialism.

That does not discredit Pakistan, does not make it Fascist, does not dispute it's claim on Baluchistan, but now CIA's involvement discredits what Baluchistan claims.\n\nIt is this inconsistency that aligns you with all Islamist who use communist movements for their Islamist ends.\n\nAnd even your \"method\" of analysis that you want others to \"accept\" -  this \"Which nation is supporting which\" method being the determinant of the nature of the state and nature of movements - is some astoundingly addition to Marxism. By this logic, since U.S was against Nazis, and U.S was capitalist, therefore, Nazis have to be good.

No Marxist will forget, however, that capitalism is progressive compared with feudalism, and that imperialism is progressive compared with pre-monopoly capitalism. Hence, it is not every struggle against imperialism that we should support. We will not support a struggle of the reactionary classes against imperialism; we will not support an uprising of the reactionary classes against imperialism and capitalism.\"\n\nWe will not support a reactionary class. \n\nAnd Iran is fascist. It openly massacred all communists right after the Islamic revolution. Did it not? It does the exact same thing in terms of super structure that Pakistan and other Fascist entities do. Brainwashes entire swathes into believing that it is absence of Islam (religion, ethnicity, other tactics Fascists use) that is responsible for \"society's corruption\", instead of class exploitation. And Iran is even a open dictatorship, and it is not communist class in power, so what does it make Iran? 1) Open dictatorship of the clerical capitalists 2 ) Super structure that mobilize masses to fight someone else than capitalists.\n\nWhat does that make Iran? Fascist. The entire super structure of Pakistan is quite Fascist in nature, with \"Islam and Ummah\" being the criteria of a \"moral society\", and absence of them being the cause of \"corruption on earth\". But to your mind, your nation that has declared Ahmadis non Muslims and persecute them, is not Fascist. But India is Fascist. \n\nRight now in India I see Mullahs everyday calling for bringing Sharia law to the nation on National News. This might not be shown in your Pakistan's channel, as their main agenda is to maintain a paranoia among Muslims, to justify \"separate Muslim nation\" ideologue. Nonetheless, you seem to be quite unaware that India is not Fascist yet. It has a Fascist government in power, absolutely, but open dictatorship has not been established. Far from it. Your Pakistan is more Fascist than India. But you seem to be in complete denial of it. And justify it occupation of Baluchistan. \n\nNow please forgive me if I do not support Islamist movements and call out an Islamist when I spot one.

Fixed capital is that which passes its value bit by bit to the finished product. In the previous example, the oven that cooks the pizza has a fixed lifespan where it is used in production and passes a portion of its value to the finished product. \n\nThe capitalist takes money, buys labor power and constant capital in the proportions necessary to produce the commodity.  Laborers work, produce the commodity which is sold for a profit. While it is true that the constant capital is necessary in definite physical quantities for labor to be productive, that does not counter the claim that labor is exploited in production. Marx argued that constant capital does not create any additional value beyond what it already possesses. Variable capital, however, does which gives the capitalist an arbitrage opportunity. The capitalist pays a wage (price of labor power)  and receives that value back, plus a profit (unpaid labor).  The difference between what is paid and what the capitalist receives in terms of money and value constitutes the material basis for profit.\n\nTl;dr capital inputs are necessary but do not create additional value in production over what they originally have.

Most of what we refer to are the contradictions between the white working class, and, well, to put it bluntly, pretty much everyone else. Centuries of racialization and colonialism have put the white working class in an objectively better position than their colonized counterparts. This is not to say that white workers can't be communists, obviously, but a lot of white communists fall into traps like class reductionism and denying that there is any sort of contradiction between the imperial core and the periphery, basically treating the international proletariat as one monolithic whole and blinding themselves to the effects of five centuries of colonialism, which is an idealistic analysis at best and crypto-white supremacist at worst.\n\n2. you'd have to elaborate a bit on this, but if you're getting at what you think I'm getting at, I think I       \npretty much answered this above also. A lot of white communists don't incorporate colonialism into       \ntheir analysis of capitalism, which is incredibly harmful not only for the movement internally, but   \nexternally.

{"author":"throwawayacctcommie","body":"It's good that you are thinking about these issues. I myself often contemplate what it would mean if the Third-Worldist analysis were *wrong*. These days, it becomes harder and harder to even conceive of this being possible for me, but there are few things to consider.\n\nFirstly, if the Third-Worldist analysis is wrong, this doesn't negate the struggle against the imperialist labor bureaucracy. Marxist-Leninist tactics in the trade union movement should be to expose the labor leaders as nothing but frauds working with the imperialists and selling out the workers. Third-Worldism doesn't *negate* this, is just explains to us why this tactic doesn't *work* at all (and in 'America,' hasn't worked since it was first tried by Daniel DeLeon over a hundred years ago).\n\nSo one thing I think would be true *if* the Third-Worldist analysis were wrong, is that there should exist a large Marxist-Leninist or similar presence in the trade union movements in the advanced capitalist countries doing *exactly what Lenin told us to do*. Far from this, there are generally only a handful of groups doing this type of activity, and they are generally extremely tiny sects, even compared to the tiny amount of people attracted to revolutionary politics in *any* form. I think the largest group who openly has the correct orientation towards the US labor bureaucracy is the Trotskyist group SEP, and they're still nothing but a tiny sect with no influence inside the trade union movement. So here, the Third-Worldist analysis tells us *why* we don't see this; because any revolutionary group agitating against the imperialist labor bureaucracy is going to be universally shunned by the 'workers' in the imperialist countries.\n\nMoreover, the further away you get from the imperialist core, the more this is what you actually *see* going on in the trade union movements. Greece is probably the most instructive example of this, which has a Marxist-Leninist party with a huge presence in the trade union movement and in politics. So what we *theorize* to be able to find inside the imperialist core if 'workers' were *actually exploited* there, we do find on the periphery of imperialism. This is a powerful confirmation of the analysis, that no First-Worldist understanding could ever hope to explain away.\n\n&gt;How do those who believe first world workers are incapable of becoming communists due to the fact that maintaining imperialism is in their class interests explain why those of us on this subreddit have ended up becoming communists?\n\nMost people attracted to 'communism' in the West see it as a form hyper-liberalism, and gravitate toward it for that reason. Fewer (falsely) presume it is in their personal economic interests. I myself was attracted toward these ideas because people calling themselves communists and socialists presented the best explanations for why the US engages in war, but I have found through the years I am an extreme minority.\n\nIn any case, the number of people attracted to these ideas in any form is vanishingly small. You can fairly accurately estimate the size of the entire *active* US 'left' by counting up the number of people who attend social events like the US Social Forum, or just counting up the amount of people claimed to be members of various radical groups. That number is somewhere between 10,000-25,000, which is absolutely nothing in a country of some 300,000,000 people. Active leftists are an anomaly, an aberration. The overwhelming masses of First-Worlders want nothing to do with socialist politics.\n\n&gt;What are the reasons behind the sectarianism and ineffectiveness of first world communist organisations?\n\nMany organizations are just straight-up cults, and they are in competition with one another to recruit from the same small pool of people actually attracted to revolutionary politics. They will find ideological reasons to fight with each other that basically amount to little more than turf-wars. Only in the largest cities do you even see more than a single (tiny) 'socialist' organization, and they are usually connected to the local unions in some fashion. Many young idealist radicals get used up by the labor bureaucracy for years before they realize it is a scam.\n\n&gt;what are the tasks of first world communists in the present day? \n\nAll sorts of things could be possible, but the most effective of all tactics would involve illegal activity meant to funnel money to budding revolutionary movements in other countries, like the [The Blekinge Street Gang](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blekingegade_Gang), but you fill find *no one* is willing to do this type of activity (again, something Third-Worldism can explain very well. *Actually exploited* people would be more than willing to do all sorts of illegal activity, because they have very little to lose by it.).\n\nOther things could be done, primarily spreading information about imperialism as far and wide as possible. Probably the most useful thing a Third-Worldist could do in the trade union movement in Western countries is to simply document the vast amount of corruption that takes place and make this information as widely available as possible. This would not only give genuinely revolutionary trade union movements around the world ammunition against their competitors (because Western backed business-unionism does *compete* with revolutionary unionism in the Third-World), but it would also *deny* the imperialist labor bureaucracy quality candidates to use and abuse. They would only recruit the most self-interested scumbags to do their organizing activity, who would undoubtedly do as little work as possible for the most money, thus further hurting their ability to function effectively.\n\nThere is also the possibility of coodrinated campaigns of violence directed at the loudest spokespeople of imperialist intervention abroad. Essentially this would be a form of anti-imperialist *terrorism* directed at vulnerable targets who are given large platforms to espouse imperialist talking points, and would probably actually be pretty easy to get away with. But again, *no one* does this, and you should ask yourself why that is the case.\n\n&gt;Are there any theories or predictions about how things will unfold in the future?\n\nYeah. It is essentially what you predicted, but most people (correctly, IMO) think fascism will come long before revolution. No advanced capitalist country, when a political crisis happens, has ever went socialist. They *all* go fascist. The first thing the First-Worlders will demand, if they are somehow denied their expected standard of living because imperialism is failing them, is to reinstate this relationship.\n\nIn the end, even the imperialist bourgeoisie won't have a choice in the matter, as the First-World imperialist labor aristocracy will take command of imperialism directly.","created_utc":1532143614,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

I would recommend *The Meaning of Marxism* by Paul D'Amato as a good introductory book (newest edition is from 2014 I believe). *The Communist Manifesto* is also a good starting point when you're ready to wade deeper into the pool, and the *Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844* by Marx is also easier to digest compared to some other more difficult works by him like *Capital*. *The State and Revolution* by Lenin is also a very essential book to read for Marxism 101 which arguably does a better job explaining conventional Marxism than Marx himself.","created_utc":1532144371,"score":9,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"nice_try_western_spy","body":"defiantly read the manifesto, its a good starting point; but the manifesto is short, and the manifesto is just a surface level read, its not the end all be all. next you have to understand that the manifesto and Capital are not right next to each other, in a manner of speaking, you should not read the manifesto and then go into Capital; Capital is a beast, and you will need a concrete understanding of marxism before you begin to read it. i suggest you read other important texts first such as [State And Revolution](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/ebooks\/lenin\/state-and-revolution.pdf) and [Dialectical And Historical Materialism](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm). you also have r\/communism101 for questions you may have about marxism, they also have an [FAQ](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/communism101\/wiki\/index) for frequently asked questions, this FAQ is really a gold mine i suggest you utilize it. \n\nand also, here are some other things you should know before you jump in, things i sure wish i knew before i went into marxism: \n\n1. keep a open mind: becoming a marxist is traumatic, you basically just throw away a lot of things you were taught in school or just in general. of course, just because you were taught it in school doesn't always make it true; as marxists we want to find objective truths and we try to question everything even the most common truths, so learn to take that mind set. you are going to learn new things about the world as well as people, it can be shocking at first, but never give in to feelings, marxism is a science and you should try to approach everything as a scientist would. so in short, keep an open mind. \n\n2. know your boundaries: when you first start off you really want to take baby steps. some comrades who start off think they have to go out in the streets and riot and do all this crazy stuff before they even form a concrete basis of marxim, you have to know your own pace and you have to know your own boundaries. you have to know when you are being consumed and when it is time to come up for air, and you also have to know when its time to walk back into the fray. just remember, take baby steps, don't overload yourself. \n\n3. marxism is big: a lot of people think becoming a marxist is like changing political parties, (US) democrat and republican for example. they think all they need to do is understand what these groups stand for and then they are basically done, but both of those parties are far similar then we realize. both of those parties are capitalist parties, they uphold liberalism, going from a republican to a democrat is a small leap when compared to going from a upholder of capitalism to a marxist. marxism is an ideology, it is not just an economic system, it encompasses everything. a lot of people just think becoming a marxist is this small thing, when in reality it is a massive change in the way you see the world and everything in it. so do not under estimate the task at hand. \n\n4. anarchists and marxists are not as similar as they seem: they both two distinct ideologies based on two distinct ideas and philosophies, they are not very interchangeable. \n\n5. stay away from trotsky. \n\ngood marxist youtubers you should check out: \n\n[Comrade Hakim](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCPPZoYsfoSekIpLcz9plX1Q) \n\n[Tovarishch Endymion](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCTG-iJm0HtjWVOAwN8sA4Xg) \n\n[The Irish Marxist Leninist](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCYawRziAl8boGHd0OoTcPeA) \n\ngood luck comrade \n\n\n","created_utc":1532149628,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

In a sense they see it as a reflection of the patriarchal society that capitalism breeds and is guilty of subjugating women. Inheritance is also part of the family structure and is a problem as wealth is passed from one generation to the next. Not that they are opposed to getting married and having children, as they both did this, but are opposed to the structure and mindset of nuclear families. As for gay rights and generally all queer people Marxists are in favor but I don't think it's bc of the fact they weaken family values, but that capitalist structures have almost relegated them to a second class of people, inferior to hetero or cis counterparts in the division of labor among other things.

You conflate Muslims with Islam\n\n2. You assume no context to actions taken against Communists by Muslim leaders. For example, you mentioned the Leaders of the Iranian revolution executing many communists and socialists. What you forgot to clarify is that the thousands of socialists and communists mentioned weren't socialists or communists. They were members of the Mujahidin I Khalq. Which classifies itself as Marxist but is anything but. They coudln't be the furthest thing from socialism or Communism. Use the searchbar on r\/Iranian to find out a little bit of their past.  Case in point, these guys are US funded terrorists who want regime change with themselves in power in Iran.\n\n3. Of course I would support fundamentalist Christians in their fight against imperialism. \n\nImperialism is the highest form of capitalism. Imperialism is the purest sentience of human greed magnified and made whole into a callous lump of flesh and bone. When it comes to those who oppose imperialism holding views detrimental to socialism\/Communism, it is not obligatory to cite that, considering there may be those amongst them who do not share those views. \n\nFor instance you mentioned Hamas and Hezbollah. \n\nBut you didn't mention the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\n\nYou also didn't mention how imperialism has prevented progress in these countries from happening and how it has propagated violence, death and destruction. \n\nIran wouldn't be where it is today had it Muhammad Mossadegh not been overthrown by the greedy capitalist bastards in the CIA. \n\nIraq wouldn't be where it is today, fighting ISIS and having millions of its people suffering under horrific conditions, if it didnt have the corrupt Western loving puppet government forced on them after the illegal invasion of their country by the US and its allies.\n\nISIS, for another matter wouldn't exist were it not for the US. \n\nThe Saudis would never be in power in Arabis were it not for the ridiculous support the US gives them, from arms deal to oil deals, to getting the house of Saud into power in the first place.\n\nOver in Pakistan, General Muhammad Zia Ul Haq who empowered many of the Islamist policies you see there today, would have never gained power in a coup where it not for the vociferous opposition to the socialist Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto that the US held. \n\nBack to Iraq, if you were thinking about complaining about what I wrote earlier with regards to the illegal invasion of Iraq, and were thinking of replying with something like \" Oh so you like Saddam huh\"?

Finally, you are not\nreporting data sources, and some of your data are really suspicious.\nLet me debunk your two main arguments.

And for Russia, it would seem to be the KPRF.\n\nThe KPRF, the best I can understand it, has a few hundred thousand members and a two or three dozen members in parliament and also has influence and members in a number of key trade unions. They have also been highly critical of Putin and other Russian elites as well as (obviously) highly critical of US imperialism. They also espouse Marxism-Leninism and speak very positively of Stalin and point to the fact that it was ultimately internal contradictions within the CPSU which overthrew socialism in the USSR.\n\nThey've also pointed out that for quite some time the Russian Federation, under Yeltsin, was a semi-colonial appendage of the United States: militarily, economically, socially, etc.\n\n&gt;This has been the case until recently. When it was announced that Barack Obama canceled his bilateral meeting with Vladimir Putin, a leading pro-Kremlin politician said: \u201cWashington should understand that Russia has ceased to be a political colony of the United States.\u201d This is nothing if not an admission of the fact that our country was until recently a semi-colony. Economically, it is still an appendage that provides raw materials for industrialised states, in other words, a semi-colony.\n\nIt seems to be with this general viewpoint that they critique Putin. English translations of their writings are sparse but their Russian website seems to be more updated consistently. And they obviously appear on Russian news stations but seemingly not in the same manner as other Russian political elites and far-right nationalists, obviously.\n\nTheir chairman, Gennady Zyuganov also said this in 2013.\n\n&gt;Let us not forget that the national elites always look for external enemies when faced with internal crises. This enables them to unite the nation to repel the encroachments of real and imagined enemies, to divert society\u2019s attention from its own miscalculations, putting the blame on external factors.  There is a sense that behind the current rise of anti-Western sentiments of the Russian elite is the wish to channel the growing popular discontent in a safe direction.","created_utc":1532254061,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

She is certainly a very far right person, not a Fascist.  You guys seem to use Fascism as a broad term to describe anybody who is far right, in reality Fascism is a particular far right ideology.  It is authoritarian ultranationalism, it is the belief in endless government power of the people it rules, the suppression of any beliefs it disagrees with, militarization, and blind patriotism with the nation coming before anything else.  It is rooted in the belief of social darwinism, and that men should aspire to dominate and control others.  Some strands of it such as Nazism are racially based, others such as Mussolini's Fascist party isn't really about race but simply about the nation itself, in Mussolini's case the nation was Italy.  \n\nLauren Southern wanting to stop rescue boats has nothing to do with Fascism and I'm sure she doesn't want people to drown, although drowning maybe an unintended consequence of her policies being implemented.  In all honesty there is a lot of room in my humble opinon for the argument that Islamic populations are not compatible with the West at this time.  I myself am am a strong critic of Christianity and religion as a whole as Christian institutions promote sexist and homophobic views and overall seem to be full of shit as well as an extensive history of promoting violence in the name of the bible.  While Christianity is still backwards in my view, they have evolved and gotten much better.  Islam on the other hand hasn't has such reforms and is still the same as it was 500 years ago.  In most Muslim countries, women still cannot drive.  Women cannot go out in public and show their face.  Women are controlled by their fathers and their husbands.  Statistics have also shown that large segments of the Muslim population support violence against non-believers as well as women who cheat on their husbands among other things.  These statistics to me are quite disturbing and combined with the fact that after the refugee crisis there was a massive spike in crime and terrorism, particularly rape within Europe leads me to believe that a large enough percentage of the Muslim population is still too backwards to be allowed to come to our countries.  So yes I'm advocating not allowing people from Muslim countries in at the moment.  No that is not Fascist and it does not mean I don't support immigration, I'm fine with immigrants from Mexico, Puerto Rico, most African countries, China, South Korea, Thailand, wherever. \n\nI believe that everyone deserves a platform, communists, anarchists, far right people, and yes literal Fascists.  As long as you are not telling people to literally go out and assault people you deserve the right to have a platform no matter how heinous your beliefs because once you ban say Communism, then you can ban far left people.  You can accuse non communist far lefties of being Communists and deplatform them.  Then you can accuse everyday liberals and get them deplatformed.  The samething applies to deplatforming Fascists, pretty soon normal Conservatives don't have a right to speak.\n\nI'm not a liberal, just a random asshole with some opinions.  My views involve a mix of left wing and right wing view points if you are curios to engage in a discussion.  Why I'm here? I just like discussing stuff with people, sharing opinions.

{"author":"ProudML","body":"I mean many comrades already answered this in the comments but communists are dominantly atheists because of our beliefs on historical and dialectical materialism. However, and I gotta add this, there is communists who are religious. I know Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Wiccan and Satanic communists. If anything religion doesn't automatically lower one's ability to be a good communist.\n\nWe live under capitalism and religion arises from the struggles of people. It is why the most religious places have historically been those struggling the most, or those lacking scientific advancement. \n\nAnyway, even religious communists, be them short in supply, can be good communists based on; 1) Not letting their religion dictate their ability to fight for workers. Unless they're guided by liberation theology. 2) Understanding and using materialist analysis to understand class struggle both historic and current. 3) Using their religious connection to bring religious workers to class consciousness. And 4) Understand the importance of separation of church and state in the interests of workers as a whole.\n\nWhile most communists are atheists, it is important to understand there are religious comrades and they deserve respect. To war with fellow leftists, or workers in general, on the grounds of religion is anti-Marxist, since Lenin made clear in his works \"The Attitude of the Workers\u2019 Party to Religion\" that to war against religion would push people too it; and for struggling workers who believe in their religious beliefs hold dear to it since it feels like their only hope, that would effectively destroy the connection between communists and workers very quickly. \n\nI feel people focus too much on the quote by Marx \"Opium of the masses\" and not enough on the context. I'll share the full quote for all who haven't seen it yet:\n\n\"The foundation of irreligious criticism is: Man makes religion. Religion does not make man. Religion is, indeed, the self-consciousness and self-esteem of man who has either not yet won through to himself, or has already lost himself again. But man is no abstract being squatting outside the world. Man is the world of man \u2013 state, society. This state and this society produce religion, which is an inverted consciousness of the world, because they are an inverted world. Religion is the general theory of this world, its encyclopaedic compendium, its logic in popular form, its spiritual point d\u2019honneur, its enthusiasm, its moral sanction, its solemn complement, and its universal basis of consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of the human essence since the human essence has not acquired any true reality. The struggle against religion is, therefore, indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion. Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo.\"\n\nThe reason I went in to the whole religious communists is some may think communists can't be religious, or that to be such makes you \"not a true communist.\" I just wanted to add this to shut down that gatekeeping mentality in its tracks.","created_utc":1532336580,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

Isolated worker coops don't address things like: what if its more profitable for one coop to pollute a river to save costs, and it affects a different community?

In this campaign, a technological breakthrough allowed the substitution of the human-military component for an ultra-smart-completely-bad-ass AI that can best the human race at almost every aspect. Be it fabricating all kind of robots; by its superior strategically thinking or anything else.\n\nAll of this while still being ruled by capitalists, so it starts wiping the \"excessive human garbage\" (also known as poor people or non-capitalist ones - including the ones who used to be in the military). So the main goal of the players would be to stop it using the help of all the people they could count. As I plan to do it with a realistic touch, things like food\/clothes\/GUNS would not so easy to obtain and they would have to organize all the people hiding from the AI to produce those things and fight together with them to survive. On the long run the objective would be erase\/rewrite this AI and kill the remanescent capitalists. And also avoiding traitors bringing capitalism back through their acts of egoism.\n\nI know it sounds a little bit *clich\u00e9*, but as the only marxist at the group it brought me joy when they asked for a futuristic D&amp;D campaign.

{"author":"Anargnome-Communist","body":"Most D&amp;D settings are feudal, so a revolution would look different from what most people expect in this day and age. You can embrace this and do something with the overthrow of feudalism, but keep in mind that Marx writes about this as a revolution of the bourgeoisie. \n\nIf I were to do this, I'd set it in an era close to the revolts of 1848. Have some form of upcoming magical capitalism with old noble families and newly rich factory owners hoarding all the wealth and power. In a D&amp;D setting, this would also mean controlling magic. Just make magic relatively scarce and make up something cultural about only noble blood can perform \"real\" magic, paired with a brutal crackdown on any proletarian who is more proficient than just being able to cast one spell over and over. \n\nIn rural areas, focus on something like the enclosure movement and have your players interact with commoners who are very clear about their historical claim on the commons. Like, if your players aren't revolutionary inclined, you can be very clear about how the local lords are breaking century old traditions and customs by closing off huge swaths of land. If your players still don't get riled up, have an NPC be brutally arrested for picking up wood on the side of the road. \n\nIn urban areas, focus strongly on the terrible living and labor conditions of the working class and the contrast with the lavish lifestyle of the rich. Show talented mages forced to cast the same freezing spell over and over to cool large amounts of food for some rich family and going home to eat crap. Have them meet a labor organizer who just got his ass kicked because he got angry that yet another child got killed making fancy clothes or something. Show a minor strike be shot down using brutal and painful magic. Have sweatshops for ritual components. \n\nI mean, you know how capitalism sucks, it would suck in the same way with magic. \n\nThen, as the players do their first quests (which could be a bog-standard quest, don't jump into a revolutionary scenario from the start), show increasing unrest. Speeches given outside workhouses that get quickly shut down by guards. Protesters being beaten bloody. At some places, barricades are going up. \n\nAfter the success of the first quest, the party gets hired by a rich merchant. He recently bought a factory that kills unicorns to make expensive medicine against some fatal condition. He doesn't want his workers to get infected by the stench of striking, so he wants the party to (a) \"take out\" the more radical elements of his workforce (the players will need to find who these are and in doing so they will see the personal trauma of capitalism and hear the reasons for revolution) and (b) \"deal with\" any strikes that might happen. If the players decide to smash some picket lines, have the workers go down in one hit, and give them the painful details of the workers dying, jumping in front of the child laborers to try and shield them and the solidarity while they are getting killed. \n\nAfter this or if they decide to turn on the merchant, get the revolution going in earnest. Barricades on every street, castles and mansions in flames, brutal suppression...\n\nOther than that, here are some minor anti-capitalist ideas I use in my campaign:\n\n* Have a ruling class of literal vampires who use the souls of drained workers to power their machines. \n* Zombies as \"dead labor.\"\n* Some interpretations of Dwarven religious ideas are almost explicitly communist. They value hard work and solidarity above all. \n* I have a Halfling leader called \"Kropot\" and his family line is called the \"Kropot-kin.\"\n* The hoarding behavior of dragons make them a great metaphor for the ultra-rich. \n* I have a city based on revolutionary Catalunya whose harbor gets blockaded by merchant cities using magic to put icebergs in their harbor. \n* I use the weirder places of the D&amp;D setting (the Feywild and the Far Realm) to represent the capitalist optimization process that can occasionally align with what mortals want but will ultimately result in their destruction. \n\nHope I could give you some inspiration.

Plus they uphold Marxism-Leninism as a guiding principle and we all know what that means anyway.\n\nThis also puts the country more in line with allied forces of the left and socialist left in the region, as we saw at the Sao Paulo forum, they are very interested and making their movement towards socialism a continental movement. This can be seen as a change to help facilitate that and make it more palatable -- a tactical move taken with a deep understanding of the current conditions in the region.\n\nAlso Cuba is approaching the European Union as a possible trading partner to ease the worst effects of the blockade and to pressure the US to drop the blockade. This rhetorical shift, along with the additions of President and Prime Minister that nobody is talking about, can only help in that process and similar ones going forward -- though I don't think that this is primarily why they're making the move.","created_utc":1532451538,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"AdmiralKurita","body":"I have provided the perspective of a Polish man that I follow on Disqus. I was particularly impressed by his insight that American propaganda was successful because it convinced so many that much of the problems in the Eastern bloc were due to socialism, and that by overthrowing it would solve so many problems. Such propaganda influenced people to loath socialism due to the perception that it was holding them back. In contrast, in many other countries that aren't materially prosperous as Western Europe, people do experience discontent, but they do not have the same odium for their system. \n\nRemember that people in Eastern Europe really did hate socialism, and I think him for giving an answer as to why they despised it.\n\nAgain, it is not that socialism in Eastern Europe that failed, but it was the American propaganda that convinced the people of Eastern Europe that it was holding them back. The dissolution of socialism in Eastern Europe was less due to socialism and more due to the success of Western propaganda. Of course, capitalism did not deliver, and there are people, who even in the revisionist dictatorship of Romania, many people are still nostalgic of socialism instead of capitalism there.  \n\n&gt;I was born in Poland and lived through martial law in the 1980's. **At the time I hated communism with a vengeance, because I was convinced that Poland could enjoy Western-style prosperity if only communism was overthrown.** But after 25 years of capitalism I realized that the Soviet occupation and communism was a golden age of rapid economic growth, and advancement in education and culture. Whole cities were rebuilt in Poland after WWII, and the whole country was industrialized. Millions of poor farmers moved to cities and worked in new factories. Their children obtained higher education for the very first time (including my parents). Poland was transformed from a backward agrarian society to an industrial society. If you go to Poland today you'll see that most people still live in apartments built under communism. Most of the infrastructure (railways, power plants, etc.) was also built under communism. The only new thing are discount stores and hyper-markets. Over two million Polish citizens have emigrated in search of jobs, most of them young and educated. That's a demographic catastrophe on the scale of WWII.\n&gt;Therefore over time I have finally realized that the Soviet Union not only liberated Poland from German occupation, but it transformed Poland into a modern nation, which generations of Poles were dreaming about. And today I'm grateful to them for that.\n\nhttps:\/\/disqus.com\/home\/discussion\/nationalinterest\/the_super_simple_reason_nazi_germany_crushed_france_during_world_war_ii\/#comment-3164393575\n\n\n&gt;I grew up in Eastern Europe under communism (not Ukraine), and a common delusion there was thinking that Eastern Europe would become like Western Europe if only the Soviet Union would collapse. All the shortcomings of Eastern European reality were conveniently blamed on the Soviet Union, and in particular on Russia. 25 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union we can see that Eastern Europe hasn't turned into Western Europe, **and it wasn't the Soviet Union holding them back.** The problems of Eastern Europe can't be blamed on Russia, as Ukrainians are trying to do. Ukrainians will discover that their problems are due mostly to their own shortcomings, even though it may be painful to admit.\n\nhttps:\/\/disqus.com\/home\/discussion\/bloombergview\/ukraine_is_in_danger_of_becoming_a_failed_state_02\/#comment-2347313629\n\n\n\n&gt;There was no bondage and servitude under Soviet occupation, even though I thought there was when I was growing up in Eastern Europe. Soviet occupation was extremely benevolent, and thanks to it Eastern European countries quickly rebuilt after WWII and grew tremendously. **The problem was that Eastern Europeans thought they could achieve even more, and were restless looking at Western Europe next door.** So the Soviet Union gave them their freedom, because the cost of empire became tiresome. But it turned out that Eastern Europeans have achieved very little with their new freedom, or have even destroyed what was built under the Soviet Union. The truth is that Eastern Europeans are still far from catching up to Western Europe, because it wasn't the Soviet Union holding them back, but their own faults.\n\nhttps:\/\/disqus.com\/home\/discussion\/bloombergview\/us_build_up_in_europe_serves_no_purpose\/#comment-2676178862\n\n[There is no such thing as Soviet occupation, unless, of course, you want to consider countries such as Brazil, El Salvador, and Guatemala to be occupied by the US. More correctly, there were under the US sphere of influence, just as Poland was in the Soviet sphere.]\n\n\n\n\n&gt;If the Stasi and East German communists were so horrible, then why are so many East German voters willing to vote for them today? And why are West German voters so opposed to the Stasi, if they never experienced living under their rule, and their only knowledge of East Germany is from Western propaganda (media)?\n\nhttps:\/\/disqus.com\/home\/discussion\/bloombergview\/germany_is_growing_more_tolerant_of_extremism\/#comment-3114580398\n\n&gt;\n**I grew up in Eastern Europe on a steady diet of anti-communist propaganda and blind, unquestioning pro-Western euphoria.** So I now find myself quite puzzled by my own realization that the Soviet Union produced world-class research and technology, including mathematicians and programmers.\nYes, Russia suffered an enormous brain-drain after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but as the article points out, that brain-drain has subsided in the recent decade. Besides, all of Eastern Europe is suffering a brain-drain, and free work and travel agreements with the West are making it even worse than in Russia.\n\nhttps:\/\/disqus.com\/home\/discussion\/bloombergview\/russias_math_geniuses_work_mainly_in_the_west\/#comment-2469892976\n\n&gt;I lived through martial law in Poland in the 1980's, and **at the time I thought it was tyrannical, so I hated communists with a vengeance.** I wasn't politically active, but I did spend a night in jail after being caught by the police. I could never imagine that one day I would defend general Wojciech Jaruzelski, who declared martial law.\n\n&gt;But now looking back I'm amazed to realize that martial law in Poland in the 1980's was actually very mild compared to what many Blacks or Latinos experience in the U.S. today. For example, only a handful of people were killed during several years of martial law in Poland, when trade unions were rioting in the streets. By comparison cops in the U.S. kill over a thousand people every year, many of them unarmed and innocent. Another example is that the incarceration rate in the Soviet Union under the infamous Gulag system was actually lower than the U.S. incarceration rate when it peaked in 2008, with about 1 in 100 U.S. adults behind bars.\n\n\n&gt;Over the years since the fall of communism I have also developed a totally new perspective on life in communist Poland and the Soviet Union, and now I'm amazed to realize that communism was a golden age of rapid economic growth and advancement in education and culture.\n\n&gt;After WWII whole cities were rebuilt in Poland, and the whole country was industrialized. Millions of poor farmers moved to cities and worked in new factories. Their children obtained higher education for the very first time (including my parents). Poland was transformed from a backward agrarian society to an industrial society. If you go to Eastern Europe today you'll see that most people still live in apartments built under communism. Most of the infrastructure (railways, power plants, etc.) was also built under communism. The only new thing are discount stores and hyper-markets. Only recently Poland started building highways, but those are thanks to EU funds or they are private toll roads.\nGeneral Wojciech Jaruzelski was an enforcer of communist dictatorship in Poland, and thanks to that Poland managed to rebuild after WWII, and transform itself into a modern industrial society, and I am deeply grateful for that.\n\nhttps:\/\/disqus.com\/home\/discussion\/bloombergview\/why_poland_wants_to_punish_a_dead_general\/#comment-3055089642\n","created_utc":1532461362,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Tech4dayz","body":"Since a few people have answered your initial question (at least without going into excruciating detail) I'll just add a few things to help you along your long journey to proper theory and praxis.\n\nReading is the most important thing you can do, if you check out our side bar you will find a lot of great resources for socialist\/communist literature and history, all of it free.\n\nI'm not sure how far along you are with understanding communism, but here are a few tips I personally wished I had when I was a young budding communist.\n1:Don't fall for centrist logic loops like \"violence is NEVER the answer\" It's not preferred, but no one has ever stood up to their oppressors with kind words or by ignoring it until it goes away.\n2: If you are a westerner (particularly in the US) Don't go around telling people your a communist with the hope of debating and convincing far-right sympathizers to lean more left, it won't work (not often enough to be bothered with anyway) you'll just drive yourself insane.\n3: Communism isn't just about knowing philosophy or economics or even history, it's about action and organization. It might not be easy now since you are so young, but get organized with other local communist, and if there is a local party, look into it. Although this goes again with the western thing from above, do watch out for \"socialist\" orgs that aren't really socialist but rather social democrats. They aren't real leftist. Typically asking about an org here on r\/communism101 will get you the answers you need to know about an org and their legitimacy.\n4: Don't be revisionist. A lot of young socialist fall for the trap of trying to understand things that are just to hard for them and don't look for help understanding difficult topics. This leads to misunderstanding of your own ideology, which leads to incorrect theory, which leads to incorrect practice, which always manifest itself as Ultra-leftist or oppertunist. That is how you turn into a Trot. (And thats bad)\n5: Don't be a reformist. You can not and will not reform a capitalist government into a socialist one. Don't fall for the liberal mistake of thinking you can reform the democratic party or some off the wall shit like that. It is 100% impossible, I assure you.\n\nThat's it for now because I'm running out of time to type this. If you want some more direction, DM me or start asking questions over a r\/communism101 (Sorry if there are any spelling or grammar mistakes, I didn't have time to re-read this before posting)","created_utc":1532464369,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Ozcom","body":"See original with illustrations at https:\/\/mike-servethepeople.blogspot.com\/2007\/12\/book-review-alias-chin-peng.html\n\nTuesday, December 11, 2007\nBook review: Alias Chin Peng\n\n\nI\u2019ve just finished reading Alias Chin Peng: My Side of History, which I bought online from Select Books in Singapore.\n\nChin Peng was the Malay Chinese leader of the Malayan Communist Party during the so-called Malayan Emergency.\n\nHe was born Ong Boon Hua on October 21, 1924 in Sitiawan where his parents had a bicycle shop. By the age of 13 he was active in the nationalist movement around Sitiawan. \u201cMy generation dreamed of doing away with British colonialism in Malaya,\u201d he remarks in the opening paragraph of the book. \u201cI am proud of this fact.\u201d\n\nBy the age of 15, he had read Edgar Snow\u2019s Red Star Over China and Anna Louise Strong\u2019s Soviet Democracy. But what impressed him most was Mao Zedong\u2019s On Protracted War.\n\nIn January 1940, having been active in raising funds to support Chinese resistance to Japan, Ong Boon Hua was inducted into the Communist Party of Malaya as a probationary member.\n\nThe Japanese conquest of Malaya and the British capitulation in Singapore created the conditions for the emergence of the armed forces led by the CPM, the Malayan National Liberation Army, to be the only reliable and consistent anti-Japanese force in occupied Malaya.\n\nDuring this period, Chin Peng - as Ong Boon Hua became known \u2013 hosted members of the British South East Asia Command in the jungle bases of the CPM, giving the war-time ally and former colonial rulers every opportunity to witness the effectiveness of the CPM\u2019s campaign.\n\nSo highly regarded by the British was Chin Peng that he was personally decorated with war service medals by Lord Mountbatten, and later bestowed with an OBE.\n\nYet with the reimposition of British rule after the defeat of Japan, Malaya was plundered of US dollar reserves (resulting from the sale of tin and rubber to the US) by the British. It was Britain\u2019s major source of US currency at the time. A growing impoverishment of the labouring population followed.\n\nThe British plantation owners oppressed the mainly Indian and Chinese labourers, and used thugs to physically break strikes for better conditions and pay. The British administration refused to grant the CPM legal status, although it operated openly between 1946-8 (see opposite) and planned legislation restricting the activities of trade unions.\n\nIt so happened that around this time, in 1948, Communist Party of Australia leader Lance Sharkey was passing through Singapore.\n\nChin Peng recounts how the CPM arranged to meet with him, and questioned him on how the CPA dealt with strikebreakers. He describes Sharkey as saying bluntly: \u201cWe get rid of them\u201d.\n\nOne of the CPM members present then asked Sharkey: \u201cYou mean you eliminate strikebreakers, Comrade\u2026.kill?\u201d\n\nSharkey \u201cconsidered the question carefully. The he said, \u2018But not in the cities. Only in the outlying areas. The rural areas. The mining areas.\u2019\u201d\n\nAccording to Chin Peng, \u201cSharkey\u2019s words sent a rush of reinforced fervour through our gathering.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cfervour\u201d was for armed struggle against the plantation owners and in defence of plantation workers, and against the British and for Malayan independence.\n\nFrom this moment on, and partly inspired by the boastfulness of the Australian Party leader, Chin Peng, OBE, became Chin Peng, CT \u2013 communist terrorist.\n\nChin Peng, however, is at pains to point out that the CPM conducted its armed struggle cleanly, treating captives according to Mao\u2019s policies on leniency towards prisoners.\n\nThe British, he says, were the real terrorists, killing and decapitating captives (see photo opposite).\n\nChin Peng is not at all reluctant to reveal the weaknesses of the CPM\u2019s position at this time. Despite having some prominent Malays in its leadership, the party was overwhelmingly Malay Chinese in its composition. And by \u201cresettling\u201d villagers sympathetic to the CPM, and controlling their access to food, the British were able to reduce the CPM guerillas to starvation as the jungle provided no real sources of sustenance.\n\nThe CPM and its armed forces, with no choice in the matter, operated less like the Red Army in China - which had access to liberated areas and civilian support - and more like Che Guevera\u2019s isolated guerilla units in Bolivia.\n\nA chance for a ceasefire in 1955 was largely torpedoed by British arrogance in insisting on a surrender by the CPM, and the armed struggle persisted until 1989 when the CPM, by now operating largely out of bases in southern Thailand, negotiated a ceasefire.\n\nIn the interim, Chin Peng had traveled to China, establishing and operating a clandestine radio in Hunan Province and broadcasting in three languages to Malaya and Singapore.\n\nWith its operational strength in decline, and the formation of breakaway \u201cparties\u201d influenced by China\u2019s Cultural Revolution, the idea of once again attempting a negotiated ceasefire arose.\n\nConditions for a ceasefire eventually matured in 1989. In the absence of the British, and partly facilitated by the Thais, Chin Peng was able to achieve what he called \u201cpeace with dignity\u201d. There was no formal surrender and the MPA destroyed its own weapons or arranged for their sale, rather than being forced to hand them over to the Malaysian government.\n\nHowever, the CPM could not win acceptance of its bid for legality. Faced with the cessation of its armed struggle, unable to operate openly and without the cadre strength to develop as an underground party, the CPM came to a close.\n\nAn octogenarian today, Chin Peng still lives in southern Thailand from where he is pursuing the right to return to Malaysia in the courts of that country \u2013 a right guaranteed to CPM members of Malay origin by the 1989 peace agreements. A recent film on Chin Peng, The Last Communist (opposite) has been banned in Malaysia.\n\nHe has no regrets about his past: \u201cI had to be a liberation fighter\u201d, he says in the book.\n\nOn p. 514 he describes himself as \u201cstill a socialist\u201d although one who no longer believes that the dictatorship of the proletariat is applicable to contemporary Malaysia.\n\nUndoubtedly, Chin Peng is one of the great men of Malayan history, a hero of the anti-colonial struggle, a hero of the anti-Japanese struggle, a man who contributed as a staunch proletarian revolutionary to a difficult stage in the application of Marxism-Leninism to the conditions of his country.\n\nAs I write, Malaysia is experiencing an upsurge in dissident activity and the state apparatus is being used to suppress peoples\u2019 aspirations for multiracial equality and social justice.\n\nEither Malaysia will become engulfed in a global crisis of capitalism creating unforeseen circumstances for the rapid creation and growth of a new Marxist-Leninist Communist party, or the slower unfolding of social contradictions will help develop a widespread mass movement for social change in which there will be an emerging opportunity for communist politics, organization and activity.\n\nThe memoirs of Chin Peng, together with those of his comrades such as Siriana Abdullah (Eng Ming Cheng) and her husband Abdullah C.D., and Shan Ruhong (Ah Cheng) will provide important lessons for a new generation of Malaysian activists.

{"author":"N0-North","body":"I'm not as well read as many, so this may not be the best answer and I suspect it's gonna ruffle some feathers, but I'm looking forward to learning from those that disagree so please, lemme know how I'm wrong. But I've been working on some reflexively lib friends (less ideology and more parroting) - some success has come from talking about how feudalism gave way to capitalism. Their understanding tends to be that communism is a reactionary response to capitalism, focused more on tearing down than building up, as opposed to a logical next step as capitalism comes to fruition and moves to decay. Give them an inch with the industrial revolution, that capitalism was a necessary part of creating the industry that lays the foundation for what comes next.  It seems to disarm them a bit since now we're not acting in opposition so much as pushing forward. After that I start talking about rents and means of production and ask rhetorical questions about the value brought to the table by landlords and ceos. They'll often bring up how hard ceos work, to which you can bring the usefulness of that work into question, since the primary labor of CEOs is mostly schmoozing with other CEOs and networking in a world of linkedin and facebook, and how unnecessary that becomes when we now have the logistical capacity to make that old kind of networking obsolete. 99% rhetoric works well here. Keep coming back to labor value and what the worker should really earn for their work, by nature of the fact that they're the ones that create value. Ask what value ownership generates in that equation, drive home that ownership is just a way to extract value from others. Bit of talk about the english enclosures here helps put it in perspective. Then start playing with the idea that the means of production should belong to the workers who produce, or better yet the people at large. Talk about what we've already nationalized, and the reasons we have. That capitalists are unable to properly manage these things. Roads, for instance, or here in canada the mobile network infrastructure. You probably have better examples that relate better to you and the person you're talking to. Define 'bourgeois' properly - the shortcut of bourgeois=rich is the colloquial understanding, so clarifying that helps. Explaining the difference between money and capital around here helps.\n\nPart of the problem is libs will often reflexively react to us as opposite them. Their position can be softened by making measured concessions, especially to the historic necessity of capitalism as it was brought forth from the conditions of it's birth, after which it becomes easier to have a frank discussion instead of an oppositional one. Libs are often workers too, so they have the same concerns we do, they just fully accepted things as 'the way they must be' and they see us as going counter-current to that, and as denying history for ideology. What we're offering isn't opposite to the now, it's rather the necessary next step, the logical result of the dialectic of class struggle. \n\nGetting them to a position of 'maybe we could nationalize all the things' is a start, haven't figured out how to move from there to 'voting doesn't work' (which is funny because in the same breath as defending 'the peaceful way' through voting they'll often admit themselves that voting is useless and maybe even puff about how they don't vote because their vote changes nothing. Dissonance abounds). But with enough momentum, they'll come to understand that themselves. These progressive democrats that think they can change things from within are inevitably going to discover they can't vote their way out of this. But if we lay the groundwork right, when that time comes, they'll understand why it didn't work and what's necessary next.\n\nEDIT: Shit I forget something - put focus on the systematic. Individual CEOs, landlords, etc may be good or bad, but if they were to ever do anything counter to the interests of capital for the benefit of humankind, they'll simply be replaced. The value of a person doesn't matter because the system will self-correct. This is what we're really targeting anyways. When they hear talk of the ills of capitalism they'll often throw out the 'yeah but this CEO gives to charity' argument. It's not about this or that CEO, it's the underlying system, which primarily desires to perpetuate itself and thus primarily selects for the kind of character that perpetuates it, and sheds any character that threatens it's nature.","created_utc":1532621859,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

Their public transit is in shambles because they can't get spare parts from the US or many other parts of the world thanks to the illegal international blockade imposed by the U.S. They can't get basic medical equipment and certain medicines which are only produced and sold in the U.S. -- this results in dozens of deaths per year in what is otherwise a world class, model healthcare system. They have almost zero access to financing of any kind because the U.S. illegally fines any international banks that will do business with Cuba, which makes them have to operate largely in cash and through saving up -- which almost no other country has to do. The U.S. fines or boycotts any companies that make items that contain any amount of raw materials (like nickel or sugar) from Cuba. \n\nThere is no more socialist camp since 1992, so socialist countries are forced to participate in international trade to get what they need. Cuba is the vanguard in terms of understanding and resisting imperialism, making sure they hold the reins and retain control in international trade, and not tolerating any threats (economic or otherwise) to their sovereignty. They will not sell out the revolution -- because the people would wage another revolution if they tried, and that's fuckin' for real.\n\nIf we respect Cuba's right to choose their own path and continue building their socialism, we have to support their necessary and unavoidable efforts to improve relations with any country, including and especially the U.S. and EU.","created_utc":1532630999,"score":10,"subreddit":"communism"}

An actual revolution is in all likelihood very far off. Marx played an enourmous role in the adoption of the 8 hour workday; no reason we shouldn\u2019t be supporting an increased minimum wage, state healthcare, etc. The state doesn\u2019t willingly give out reforms, it\u2019s only done to preserve relative good will among workers. The idea is that the proletarian class will eventually realize private property is the only thing holding them back.\n\nOther than that, do a lot of reading. Read Marx, Lenin, Mao, Luxemburg, etc. The writings of revolutionary leaders are often a product of the time they were written (ex. Lenin\u2019s take on imperialism), but much of it is still relevant and valuable. Also try and read some critical theory (including modern authors) if you can.

The media also reports far more on Palestine than it does on Kashmir, many reporters (even Indian) have been brutally murdered by the Indian army in Kashmir. While India might have started out more as a left-wing in orientation, it's been quite a while since they have actually been left-wing. \n\n&gt;I agree that Kashmir is of great importance as an object of study and political struggle, especially if we believe that Indian people's war is the laboratory for the next great socialist revolution.\n\nVery true, but our comrades engaging in PPW in India already understand the situation, they have given full solidarity with Kashmir. They encourage ALL resistance against the Indian occupation in Kashmir. I think it's about time for the international community to bring awareness to Kashmir. Especially because the \"left-wing nationalism\" in India is far gone and now India is not only a far-right state, it is a fascist state and an imperial puppet of US hegemony in South Asia. This \"left-wing nationalism\" you speak of is also a stretch, India has ALWAYS been a hindu-supremacist state, even if it tried to appear as secular. The constitution and many of Nehru's points were made to build India into a Hindu supremacist country. Muslims, Sikhs, and other minorities have been ethnic cleansed from many areas since India formed as a country, even under Nehru. Nehru-Ghandi ideology can be argued to be left-wing but in all honestly it is a pretty backwards\/hindu supremacist and reactionary tendency. \n","created_utc":1532658299,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

I should probably clarify what I mean by militancy. The PCI condemned or refused to cooperate with party-adjacent groups engaged in violent direct action. To further clarify, by party-adjacent I mean groups not officially affiliated with the party but within which PCI members operated. \n\nThese groups are what I am calling \"militant\". These groups engaged in anti-fascist actions and waged an urban guerrilla campaign. You can say the historical circumstances were different before and after WW2, and that's true, but the PCI responded the same way both times: condemnation.  \n\nThis is something that sets them apart from other communist parties around the same time. This separates them even from other parties which were becoming Eurocommunist: the PCF participated in May '68 and the PCE was a member of the Popular Front. Of these three major western European communist parties, the only one which did not in some way participate in a revolution or a revolutionary movement was the PCI. \n\nWhat were the conditions in Italy that engendered this? What made the PCI different from the PCF, besides the former being bigger? Why did the PCI respond to militancy and student revolt with condemnation, while the PCF participated within May '68 without capitulating to anarchist or Trotskyist student groups (the PCF was popular among workers, not students)?\n\n&gt;so I don't know where you got the idea that the PCI was an \"anti-Soviet party\" for continuing his line.\n\nTogliatti died in 1964. I specifically stated that because of \"...disagreements with Soviet policy and actions\" the PCI \"...post-1969 are basically an anti-Soviet party.\" We're talking about different points in time.\n\nThe PCI criticized the Soviet response to the Hungarian revolution and then the Prague Spring. During Togliatti's days right after World War 2, they were definitely a pro-Soviet party. But they drifted towards Eurocommunism because of these international policies. Obviously there are other motivating factors and the shift didn't happen overnight but we can say a definitive break between the Soviet and Italian parties happened.  \n\n&gt;e: the issue has become even more clouded because of the popularity of autonomism in its situationist form in the United States as a theory, especially in academia and among petty-bourgeois students more generally. Historically, it was never more than a fringe on a fringe and is of no importance to the kind of historical question you're asking (which I should mention is the right kind of question one should ask, it just needs focus) but clouds how most people frame the question in the first place. We're talking about mass phenomenon here which requires an analysis of Italian society as it actually existed, not as a stand in for a utopian space American radicals can project onto.\n\nI agree, but I'm not really trying to talk about the autonomists. \n\nI think Italian autonomists played a role in the Years of Lead but clearly were not a mass movement. The Red Brigades, on the other hand, were not autonomists, engaged in more militant actions and were a larger group. \n\nSo if we focus the question, why did the PCI not support the Red Brigades? How similar is this to the reason they did not support the Arditi del Popolo and similar anti-fascist militants? \n\n----\n\nI will say that for talking about historical materialism you haven't actually said much *materially* about Italy. You've pointed to one leader of the PCI who was pro-Soviet and told me what particular PCI members to read and not to read. This sounds more like Great Man theory that historical materialism.

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"Honestly, it's because I think you're approaching this from a moral standpoint where the more militant\/radical the \"better\" rather than the needs of an actual revolutionary movement. But I'll give the basic story anyway.\n\nFor Gramsci, the main failure of the communist movement after the war was that it did not create a democratic popular front. He saw this in Russia with the peasant\/proletariat alliance in particular. The first issue was that Italy was regionally underdeveloped and unevenly developed, making the communist movement as it had existed able to unite both North and South. In fact, because if the limits of \"syndicalism\" southern peasants had been instrumental in suppressing northern worker strikes. The second issue is that because of the contradiction between the advanced consciousness of the Renaissance and the backwardness of the economy, intellectuals and the middle class were more concerned with international capital than development of a national bourgeoisie (the role of the Vatican has a similar effect). Garibaldi was characterized by volunteerism and subordination to existing power because of this and was ultimately incapable of solving the agrarian question. Many of these issues, as you can imagine, are highly relevant to the third world, but questions or hegemony and passive revolution became applied to Italy as it was absorbed into the first and NATO imperialism, which to me makes the questions the PCI faced in the 70s fundamentally different.\n\nI think this interview is fascinating\n\nhttps:\/\/newleftreview.org\/I\/106\/giorgio-amendola-the-italian-road-to-socialism\n\n&gt;I believe that a political line must be based upon an objective analysis of the forces at work. Are we giving the Christian Democrats credibility? I think they are achieving this on their own, by showing that they can retain their mass base. Italians are not fools. If 14 million of them are voting DC\u2014despite inflation, scandals and misgovernment\u2014they are not doing so because we are seeking an alliance with that party, but for other reasons which we should not misunderstand. They are doing so because under the Christian Democrats there has been a great improvement in Italian living standards. Italy has seen the greatest progress in the whole of Western Europe. \n\nGramsci also talked about the west more generally and the differences between Russia as monarchy vs Britain as liberal parliamentarism, and it was this aspect which characterized the use of Gramsci after the war to justify eurocommunism. \n\n&gt;In Italy, the main obstacle...is the fact that the majority of Italians are not convinced of the need for socialism\u2014in the sense that we understand it, as a global transformation of society. You cannot make a revolution against the wishes of the majority. Even the Bolshevik revolution, an armed revolution, enjoyed the strong support of the basic masses: soldiers, peasants and, of course, workers. In Italy there is a majority, a consensus, for measures of transformation\u2014on condition that these are not presented, as is often done, with the declared objective of destroying the system. For people do not give a damn about the strategic aims of groups or parties\u2014even those of the Socialist Party. \n\nSounds pretty reasonable, right? In hindsight the PCI line was bad because the party collapsed, but why it was bad is rather complex. For me, the key is discussion of failure of the Portugese revolutionary movement, which he sees as a political failure brought about by the new political institutions of American imperialism. This is correct but only half the story, since it's economic component of NATO imperialism which I believe both caused revolutionary collapse of Portugese backwards colonialism and prevented it from turning into a socialist revolution. Despite the understanding of politics, I think these parties still had Lenin's understanding of imperialism as competing nation states fighting over resourcesand markets, something which was already moribund in the face of new globalized imperialism. But this wasn't easy to see since both the socialist movement and the national liberation movement were strong because of the dying of the old imperialism and the birthing of the new, only now in hindsight are the limits visible (and successes as well, without this moment Cuba and North Korea wouldn't exist, having surpassed the limits of decolonization and leaving a socialist legacy that's essential today).\n\nThe ultraleft response, which you seem to be an advocate of, was totally irrelevant to the great mass of Italians Amendola is discussing. \"Anti-fascism\" as you discuss it was even worse than irrelevant\n\n&gt;When the comrades in Germany said during the world crisis that the dictatorship of the proletariat was necessary in order to resolve it, they won votes, but you know where they ended up. On the crucial and burning issue\u2014unemployment\u2014they did not prevent Hitler from winning the workless. The unemployed did not give a damn about the dictatorship of the proletariat, they wanted work immediately; so fascist demagogy was able to deceive this whole mass of workers and young people and lead them onto the dangerous path which engulfed Europe in the Second World War. \n\nHe's discussing Germany but in Italy this is far more relevant since the fascist movement ended up as the nationalizing force that substituted for the bourgeoisie, it was not merely the last reaction of dying classes as in Germany.\n\nThe purpose of \"militancy\" irrespective of conditions is to make people feel radical rather than actually win against fascism. This is invisible in the US because the fascist movement is so weak (since white settlerism occupies the same political space) but is clear in places with a mass fascist movement like Hungary and India where anti-fascism tactics will only get you arrested or lynched. Either you commit to guerilla war against fascist state with the hope that the conditions of fascism will make the mass of people accept disruption of the rule of law, you commit to popular frontism with the worst kind of liberals as in Hungary today, or you bet that your forces are bigger and more popular and if fascists come after you they will fail. Anti-fascism as a movement combines the worst aspects of all three since it comes out of the anarchist tradition of disdain for the masses. \n\nI am not advocating reformism, I fundamentally disagree with Amendola. But one must honestly engage with this history without ego involved in what feels radical. There are deep, structural reasons for the way the PCI turned out, and the revolutionary moments you point to were not revolutionary moments at all, they are just remembered as such by intellectuals. \n\nAs for an anti-Soviet political stances, that doesn't really interest me. What's important is did the PCI rebel against the Soviet line in practice, in the way the Chinese did. The answer is no, the Italian road to socialism comes out of post-Stalin revisionism, that this led to conflict between the revisionists in the USSR who were limited by the democratic base of the party and the state structures and those parties which wanted to go even further does not change the fundamental sameness of revisionism. This is the only way to explain the continuity between Togliatti and Longo and why Losurdo, as much as I love him, was incapable of creating something new and ended up hitching onto revisionist China.","created_utc":1532798707,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

A factory, an apartement that you rent out or land that you don't entirely work by yourself.

It is quite reasonable to speculste though that the right to personal property might become obsolete as soon as enough abundance is reached to transition to proper communism. \n\nEdit: Smith,in the quote, didn't specify what type of property he meant, so that's probably where the confusion came from. I'm not sure he distinguishes between them at all. \n\nThe main point of the original comment was that as long as society does not grant you the rights to property, there is no property. If everyone around you goes \"there is no personal property, everything belongs to everyone\" and they enforce this rule through force, property as a material concept basically stops existing. Of course, as long as that is not in the interest of the dominant class in a society, the state will not enforce that rule. So if, in a workers' state, the abolishment of personal property is not in the workers' interests, it simply won't happen.

I guess this one: in nazi Germany, unemployment fell because of the arms industry, but poverty rose because of cut wages (up to 25% in Germany, 50% in Italy!). So much for reviving the country.\n\nHe ends the chapter by pointing out that at the time, both regimes were supported by many Americans, the private sphere specifically: newspapers praised Hitler and Mussolini (at saving their countries from communism, no less) and several industrialists had factories in Germany even during the war! These factories were also **not** targeted by bomber strikes!

But we are all born into conditions not of our own making, after all. My experience taught me what it's like to be a migrant worker. As a white American in an occupied country, my experience was different in many ways from most migrant workers around the world. But I came to think of Korea as my home, and my status as a resident was contingent upon my status as worker. All workers at my small school were in a protracted struggle against our oinking boss who ended up firing everyone who had ever worked there, including me. I was forced to leave the country since my visa was not valid after my termination. My Korean friends ended up okay, but they were unemployed and struggling for some time.\n\nMy time in Korea let me build solidarity with Korean workers in a direct way. I learned about Korea in a way that only a resident can. Of course every society is different, but something my experience taught me is that class power is ubiquitous. I like to hope that my Korean comrades learned a similar lesson. \n\nIn short, if you're looking for advice, I would say that you shouldn't let imperialists make the choice for you. Sure, we share a citizenship with those soldiers, but as Marxists we have a different loyalty that transcends borders. Working abroad can be a great catalyst for internationalist praxis and agitation. At the very least, it can offer a perspective about what a \"global working class\" actually looks like. No one can deny that imperialism makes it possible for Americans to easily work in Korea. But it is possible to turn that privilege on its head and exploit the contradictions of global capital with proper thought and action. ","created_utc":1532977549,"score":62,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"throwawayacctcommie","body":"The comments about this podcast are quite odd. While I do think there is *much* to criticize about what calls itself the \"anti-war movement\" in North America, it seems the comments have focused on Prysner and Rapone as individuals, who are allegedly not repentant enough or something to deserve to be able to comment, which is mostly ridiculous without any direct quotation of their words\/ideas about *what needs to be done*.\n\nBut let me get straight to the point I wanted to bring to the discussion; the \"anti-war movement\" is a fraud. And this is not some kind of polemic directed specifically at ANSWER, UNAC, UFPJ, etc, etc (though there are plenty of things that could be said in that regard). What exists at the moment (and I don't know now, since I have not been involved in it for a few years now, but I presume it is *worse*) is simply a ritualized display of anti-war sentiment, performed yearly by a few thousand (and *dwindling* ever year) people, a performance which the point is basically supposed to show how you're such a morally-specially snowflake.\n\nWhat the \"anti-war movement\" is **not** is a plan of action to do what Lenin *commands* us to do: [transform the imperialist war into civil war](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/lenin\/works\/1914\/sep\/00.htm). What plans do ANSWER, UNAC, UFPJ, etc, etc, have to *transform* the imperialist wars 'America' is conducting around the world, into a *civil war* inside of North America?\n\nThe honest answer (pun intended) to that is simply nothing. These organizations do not even *conceive* of what they're doing as trying to *bring about civil war inside North America*. From my own *years* of participating in this fraudulent movement, not a single person *ever* gave a speech, wrote a paper, submitted any proposals to be voted on, or even talked in hushed tones behind closed doors about this. I myself tried bring the issue up, only to be *silenced* or ignored when bringing this up.\n\nBut even if the \"anti-war movement\" actually had ideas like this (and trust me, they don't), they have no *line* that could *ever* bring about this. They neither have a line that could recruit a small group of ideologically hardened people to engage in anti-government violence, nor a *mass-line* that could lead to *mass violence* against the government (though if such a line *exists* within North America, I have no clue, and my suspicion is that no such line actually exists).\n\nThis is why the I often tell people the North American \"anti-war movement\" is really an *anti civil-war movement*. The only war they seem to *actually* oppose is the *civil war in North America*.\n\nThe situation outside of North America is even worse, with the 'UK' anti-war organizations being openly controlled by people who spread the most outrageous imperialist propaganda imaginable. There is some good material from the CPGB-ML about that imperialist mouthpiece calling itself the \"Stop the War Coalition,\" which is nothing but the worst sort of fraud imaginable. In North America, it is harder to see the \"anti-war movement\" is the *opposite* of what it claims to be (if you look into the history of the 90s anti-war movement, you'll see it was no different than what happens today in the 'UK'), but this is *blatantly* the case in the 'UK.'","created_utc":1533036710,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

I think I understand why but not completely.\n\nI appreciate this question as it speaks to a misunderstanding I may be under, thus I have more questions along the same lines. It has always been my limited understanding that work will be required in all economic systems until the very late stages, including communism (according to [Lenin: The State and Revolution](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/lenin\/works\/1917\/staterev\/)). For Communism, in accordance with Lenin's understanding of the socialist state, article twelve of the 1936 Soviet Constitution also stated; In the USSR work is a duty and a matter of honor for every able-bodied citizen, in accordance with the principle: \"He who does not work, neither shall he eat.\"\n\nI imagine that this work requirement would continue even for those in corrective labor camps and prisons. The Russian phrase, \"The heat of your work will melt your prison term!\" comes to mind in this regard. While there exists in capitalist society an incentive to police, arrest, try, and sentence citizens and other people unscrupulously for the purposes of extracting the surplus value of labor from prisoners. I fail to find support in the argument against labor while incarcerated in every instance.\n\nInstead, with a pragmatic viewpoint, I find flaws in the implementation regardless of the economic system. Perhaps someone with a more expansive knowledge base can help me come to a more complete understanding.\n","created_utc":1533066407,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"ProgressiveGOP","body":"&gt; so there was a time where korea was one..\n\nThank you so much. I appreciate the reply.  I guess my misunderstanding is there was a much larger period of time prior to the Japanese occupation where Korea was one nation. Why is it the show doesn't include anyone with an affinity for that nation which existed for generations and instead the show focuses on those with an affinity for a nation state that existed in the most brief of moments in time? Does my inquiry make sense? Seems strange that the show focuses on a nation state that existed very, very briefly rather than the nation that existed for generations prior to the Japanese occupation. What is the cause of this divergence?\n\nSeems that the show focuses on a people who's national identity only extends back two generations. When in reality the Korean people have a rich and detail ancestry that existed prior to the occupation. Though I suppose the source of the broadcast is slanted towards those with a Communist ideology, as demonstrated by the name of the series.\n\n","created_utc":1533069800,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}
