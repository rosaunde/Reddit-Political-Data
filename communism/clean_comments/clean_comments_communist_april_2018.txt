{"author":"China_comrade","body":"&gt;Thanks for that information. I love corny action movies from the 1980s and the plot reminds me of one of those.\n\nI would recommend actually watching the film, and looking for the *subtle* messages scattered throughout the film (beyond the overt pro-PLA message).\n\n&gt;I must point out, however, that an \"ideologically committed communist party\" in no way guarantees a particular social system.\n\nNice scare quotes, but you still have a huge problem explaining why a *capitalist regime* would spend millions and millions of dollars making pro-communist TV shows, glorifying Mao and the CPC.\n\nBut you could say something very similar about Lenin's NEP. The NEP was the political policy of a committed, revolutionary communist government. In fact, it appears you're completely backing away from your earlier stated position of being able to look at particular policies in a society and deciding whether it is proletarian policy or a bourgeois policy. How do you explain 24\/7 military dramas playing on Chinese television as a *bourgeois* policy?\n\n&gt;In the first place, even if we grant that they are \"ideologically committed\", it doesn't mean that their ideology is necessarily proletarian.\n\nYeah, please *attempt* to explain how Chinese media is the product of bourgeois class interests. I don't think you can, without resorting to conspiracy theories about the Chinese bourgeoisie wanting everyone to believe the country is socialist and trying to fool them.\n\n&gt;In the second place, we know that sincere communists can oversee the dissolution of socialism -- see USSR --\n\nVery few people would consider the people around Gorbachev as \"sincere communists,\" so you should choose another example (Albania, perhaps).\n\n&gt;or even oversee a utter \"failure to launch\" as a ruling party -- see the Communist Party of South Africa. \n\nThe particulars of the experience of the SACP are worth exploring more in depth, but I don't see how relevant it is to this discussion. Perhaps you'd like to expand upon this thought a bit more?\n\n&gt;Of course, it is also arguable whether the majority of the party are truly \"ideologically committed\".\n\nThat's true, but there is also the question of *Chinese nationalism*. Marxism-Leninism in the oppressed nations of the world is *always* nationalism. If you were here and could talk to people, you'd realize just how overwhelmingly nationalistic ordinary people tend to be. Once you understand this, the collapse of the USSR starts to make a lot more sense (the old MIM line on this is more correct than books like *Socialism Betrayed: Behind the Collapse of the Soviet Union*, but they are still helpful to understand the particulars of the situation).\n\n&gt;I mean, Xi's whole campaign for rooting out corruption basically admits that there is a crisis of legitimacy on some level.\n\nThere is this aspect of it, but it also becomes a way to keep the pressure on the capitalists in society.\n\n&gt;Lets put the issue a different way. The foundational premise of dialectical materialism is that (counter-)revolutions occur when the superstructure (e.g., ruling ideology) is out of sync with the material reality (development of the means of production). Am I right or wrong? \n\nRevolutions happen when people form armies. This is why the Chinese experience is so interesting to so many people all over the world. First comes the party, and from the party comes the military apparatus, and from the military apparatus comes political power. Most lefty people in the developed capitalist countries don't seem to understand this, and even the ones that do seem to have no clue how to go from step one (forming the party) to step two (forming the military apparatus).","created_utc":1522548194,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

Most Americans think that Socialism is when the government does stuff and Communism is Russia trying to destabilize our country and throwing people who own property in prison (the second point is a bit of fear, because tons of Americans want to be landowners).\n\nAfter 2016 and the Bernie Sanders phenomenon you can get away with calling yourself a Socialist now but Communism is still off-limits.

This has made it such that, at least in liberal circles, you can call yourself a Socialist and get away with it.\n\nI told my family one time that I think that Communism is necessary to protect the Socialist state from Capitalist siege and they totally flipped out. They actually called me the next day worried that I wanted to take their houses away from them and I had to explain myself in further detail.\n\nSo, I would say you can call yourself a Socialist when you are around liberal friends and family and expose them to Late Stage Capitalist criticisms without drawing too much scrutiny but I would stay away from the term communist. Also I wouldn't use the term socialist in right-wing circles unless you wanted to start a fight, those people are typically C-R-A-Z-Y.

Zionism is viewed as Justice to facists, liberals, conservatives, etc. they justify it by race, religion and neo-colonization of the Middle East. It\u2019s\nNot about Amerika or Europe loving Jewish people. As proof look at the condition of Ethiopian Jews in Israel. They are being sterilized, deported and straight up murdered. Israel is a Facist state supported by the Western World. Amerika kills it\u2019s own African American citizens and locks many of it\u2019s muslim citizens in Guantanamo without trial. Therefore we must realize that Amerika &amp; Europe lack empathy and human emotion. They support a system of white supremacy and often use religion to back up their wicked claims. They believe Jewish people are the same as them not only because of religion but race. Most Ashkenazi (if not all) are racially European white. Meaning they are the same as white supremacists and they perpetuate that system in the Middle east. Israel is nothing but colonization in the middle east.  Some view it as some type of sick continuation of the crusades. Religion and race have a huge role to play in it. Our lives are worthless in the eyes of most White Amerikans and Europeans. After all the western world are the colonizers of the world. The western world also created and supported Israel, why would they ever have empathy for Palestine and it\u2019s people? The media is just a weapon of the capitalistic and white supremacist state. Why would they conflict with the interests of their country?

Capitalism also sustains nationalism in the sense that nation states are purely for the sake of protecting the wealth of the wealthy in that region.  An international socialist movement does not declare war on other countries because countries cease to exist.  This answer is too ideal though and isn't going to be too convincing to most people.\n\nIf you want to be over prepared you should research why socialist countries invaded other countries during the Cold War (mainly the USSR) and contrast that to capitalist motivations for similar actions.\n\nIt's not possible to defend every action of socialist countries.  It's important for you to know the errors yourself so you can steer the conversation correctly when it comes up.  As materialists we should not be adverse to self critique.  Severe mistakes have certainly been made.  Although I can reason why Stalin took action as he did based on the circumstances of the world at that time, that does not excuse those actions and you should be just as ready to condemn them as any typical liberal.

{"author":"TachoNaco","body":"I can\u2019t say much, but it originates in 1954, when the government of democratic socialist president Jacobo \u00c1rbenz was overthrown by the US to protect the United Fruit Company\u2019s Interests in Guatemala. And what followed was a series of brutal military dictatorships (which R\u00edos Montt was the last of) that repressed communist movements, culminating into a civil war led by various communist groups (famously the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity) backed by the indigenous population. The government responded to them by conducting a genocide on the indigenous peoples of Guatemala. The United States knew about and supported these brutal governments and continued to back them until 1996, when peace accords were signed by the rebel groups and the government. And the most recent left-wing government was that of social democrat \u00c1lvaro Colom from 2008 to 2012. And also, the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity is now a registered political party in Guatemala and forms part of the Opposition in the Congress of Guatemala.","created_utc":1522619493,"score":30,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"TachoNaco","body":"On the subject of Jacobo \u00c1rbenz, he was the second democratically elected President of Guatemala after the overthrow of another longtime US-backed dictator Jorge Ubico. He was a prominent figure during the ten-year Guatemalan Revolution, which was the only period of time between Ubico\u2019s presidency and the end of the civil war that representative democracy existed in Guatemala. During his three-year presidency presidency, \u00c1rbenz instituted a major agrarian reform, called Decree 900, where land was taken away from the wealthy elite and redistributed to the peasants, mostly the indigenous population, which marked the first time the indigenous people of Guatemala had their own land since the Spanish conquest. This conflicted with the interests of the United Fruit Company, who had major land ownership in Guatemala, especially in its banana plantations. The United Fruit Company would respond by running a smear campaign labeling \u00c1rbenz, who was a democratic socialist, a communist and a danger to US interests, and lobbying the US government to overthrow \u00c1rbenz, which they did in 1954.","created_utc":1522620545,"score":11,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"JucheMuffin","body":"&gt;&gt; I must point out, however, that an \"ideologically committed communist party\" in no way guarantees a particular social system.\n\n&gt; Nice scare quotes, but you still have a huge problem explaining why a capitalist regime would spend millions and millions of dollars making pro-communist TV shows, glorifying Mao and the CPC.\n\nFor clarity's sake, If you read my prior posts carefully you will see that I haven't made a positive claim about the nature of the PRC ruling class as a whole. Rather I was critically examining the basic thrusts of Ajit Singh's argument.  Now, as to your question:\n\n\"Why would a capitalist regime spend millions and millions of dollars making pro-communist TV shows\"\n\nI think its an open question whether or not the Chinese media is actually pro-communist. If you wish to bring up concrete examples for us to ruminate over that is fine.\n\n&gt;&gt; In the first place, even if we grant that they are \"ideologically committed\", it doesn't mean that their ideology is necessarily proletarian.\n\n&gt; Yeah, please attempt to explain how Chinese media is the product of bourgeois class interests. I don't think you can, without resorting to conspiracy theories about the Chinese bourgeoisie wanting everyone to believe the country is socialist and trying to fool them.\n\nHmm. I think we don't have a common understanding of what ideology is and how it operates. Humour me by considering an analogous example. Consider the American Revolution. The rebels used Latin pseudonyms in their correspondence, idealized aspects of Graeco-Roman culture in antiquity, and argued that they were reconstructing certain forms of government found then, etc. Does that mean they were recreating the same kinds of society of those days? Of course not. It was not an overt \"conspiracy\", It was a cipher for their class interests.\n\n&gt; But you could say something very similar about Lenin's NEP.[...]\n\nThis is a time-honored argument for defenders of Ajit Singh's thesis which I am well aware of. I don't think its quite the slam-dunk that you think it is. In the first place, the time-frames of the NEP and the reform era are not comparable. But also, consider that the inner-party struggles that the respective policies engendered were won by opposing lines in the USSR vs. PRC! But this is worth further study on its own.\n \n&gt;&gt; Of course, it is also arguable whether the majority of the party are truly \"ideologically committed\".\n\n&gt; That's true, but there is also the question of Chinese nationalism. Marxism-Leninism in the oppressed nations of the world is always nationalism.\n\nNo, Marxism-Leninism is a much broader thing than nationalism per se. Furthermore, it advocates a pragmatic course. Here's Stalin's definitive statement on the matter: \n\n&gt; [S]upport must be given to such national movements as tend to weaken, to overthrow imperialism, and not to strengthen and preserve it. Cases occur when the national movements in certain oppressed countries come into conflict with the interests of the development of the proletarian movement. In such cases support is, of course, entirely out of the question. The question of the rights of nations is not an isolated, self-sufficient question; it is a part of the general problem of the proletarian revolution, subordinate to the whole, and must be considered from the point of view of the whole. [...]\n\n(from page 71 of *Foundations of Leninism*)\n\nThe scepticism is warranted because nationalism in a vacuum is bourgeois.  Nations arose with the rise of the bourgeoisie. In oppressed nations, national liberation was stymied because the world was already divided up by the imperialist powers. Therefore, to be a nationalist in those places is to advocate breaking away from a specific imperialist camp, and in doing so weaken them; as such it has obvious revolutionary implications.  \n\n&gt;&gt; Lets put the issue a different way. The foundational premise of dialectical materialism is that (counter-)revolutions occur when the superstructure (e.g., ruling ideology) is out of sync with the material reality (development of the means of production). Am I right or wrong?\n\n&gt; Revolutions happen when people form armies. This is why the Chinese experience is so interesting to so many people all over the world. First comes the party, and from the party comes the military apparatus, and from the military apparatus comes political power. Most lefty people in the developed capitalist countries don't seem to understand this, and even the ones that do seem to have no clue how to go from step one (forming the party) to step two (forming the military apparatus).\n\nI apologize in advance if I offend you, but you are simply spouting absurdities here. The entire history of class society consists of armies continually being raised (and obliterated) over and over. If you were right we would have attained intergalactic space communism long ago.\n\n","created_utc":1522622070,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

The truth is far simpler: the media is owned by the state, which is controlled by a communist party, which has an interest in promoting its ideology. There is not only no need to resort to ridiculous conspiracy theories that make nonsense of real-world capitalist behavior, but there is a bunch of literature available out there on how the Chinese media *actually* operates, none of it being compatible with the behavior of any Western media corporations.\n\nThis is an example of where pseudo-Marxist phrasemongering can do nothing but string words together devoid of any actual content.\n\n&gt;This is a time-honored argument for defenders of Ajit Singh's thesis which I am well aware of. I don't think its quite the slam-dunk that you think it is.\n\nThe purpose of repeatedly bringing it up is to show any curious reader that your arguments apply equally as well to Lenin's NEP. There is really no getting around this: virtually everything you say about China today can be said about Lenin's NEP, and your arguments are just echos of various radicals that hated the Bolsheviks back then. The reader can then draw their own conclusions.\n\n&gt;No, Marxism-Leninism is a much broader thing than nationalism per se.\n\nYou're definitely misinforming the reader if you're trying to imply there is no connection between Marxism-Leninism and nationalism. It doesn't take much research into nearly any communist revolution to figure this out, and moreover, it is something that the US government has known for a very, very long time. Marxism-Leninism *only* works where it is possible to win over the nationalists or to split them into two sections. Without this element, Marxism-Leninism is *always* nothing but a non-starter.\n\n&gt;I apologize in advance if I offend you, but you are simply spouting absurdities here.\n\nNo offense taken, but I do find it curious that you say this, while talking about \"intergalactic space communism\" in your next breath.\n\nI responded the way I did because I don't really care to proceed with the terminology (more like word-salad) you have employed.

{"author":"sucrerouge","body":"Nearly out of topic, but here in Greece, having a communist party in Parliament, KKE, makes things so much easier not only to say that you are a socialist, or a communist, but to act somehow. Though here, you still have the elderly who are brainwashed more than the youth, despite living one of the first proxy wars of the Cold War, that would be the Greek Civil War of 1946\u201349, see the leftist youth as a bad thing. Having the former democratic socialist Syriza making a coalition with right-wing ANEL and turning at best social democratic, implementing all this capitalist poverty on our people, has made part of our society to criticise the broader Left, and giving alibi to capitalist views. Though the wider anti-capitalism movement still holds ground and even getting wider, and if you are a youth it is more common to be booed if you are pro-procapitalism than anti-capitalism. There is though a polarisation of the political audience, and there is an going trial of the neo-nazi party Golden Dawn which is crucial to be outlawed, because now there is much tolerance to ultra-nationalist and ultra-racist propaganda, which is supported, either openly or in the shadows, and often promoted by the official representatives of the Greek Orthodox Church. Not wanting to characterise myself as a communist or even a socialist, I am the Greek guy who reads the news from the KKE website and having chats with many of my family who supports it.\n\nI guess that the word \"socialist\" in Greece is really different than in the US or generally the West. Sometimes saying you are a socialist can be seen as a bad thing, connecting it falsely with Syriza, so you have to say that you are communist, to differentiate from the term.","created_utc":1522651408,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"JucheMuffin","body":"The author somewhat contradicts his own thesis. In the first part of the article he says that the bourgeoisie is gearing up for war with Russia and China.\n\n&gt; What we are witnessing is two convergent phenomena coming together, running in parallel but now intersecting. One is a profound, political civil war going on within the summits of the capitalist political establishment, the ruling class centers of power in the intelligence agencies. The second is a qualitative re-orientation of U.S. foreign policy and the gearing up for \u201cmajor power\u201d conflict with Russia and China as the targets.\n\nBut Trump is not interested:\n\n&gt; [B]ig sectors of the ruling class and their operatives considered Donald Trump to be unfit and one of the principal reasons why the FBI and the intelligence agencies were targeting Trump even in 2016. [...] Donald Trump is perceived to be unwilling or incapable of representing or managing the common affairs of the entire bourgeoisie.\n\nThey will never be happy until Trump is gone:\n\n&gt; within the state apparatus and media, many are determined to find one way or another to end the Trump presidency, which would then be the presidency of Mike Pence.\n\nBut then, further down we read:\n\n&gt; Donald Trump has replaced Rex Tillerson, Gary Cohn and now HR McMaster, who were somewhat \u201cmoderating forces\u201d from within the traditional bourgeoisie. Who would have thought they would be the moderates? They have been replaced with people like John Bolton who is absolutely committed to war in Iran and was Dick Cheney\u2019s agent for that in 2005. It is important to remember that the only reason the U.S. did not go to war with Iran in 2005 was that its war machine became bogged down by the unanticipated armed resistance of the Iraqi people following the invasion.\nLook at the line-up: John Bolton is the replacement as National Security Advisor. Mike Pompeo will be Trump\u2019s Secretary of State. Pompeo is an extreme right-wing Tea Party Republican. He is not just an Islamophobe, an extreme racist, but he also wants to rip up the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the agreement with Iran, in order to set the stage for confrontation with Iran.\nWe have entered a new, extremely dangerous moment. Trump has created a cabinet that is \u201chis\u201d cabinet. It is a war cabinet. He is now free from previous restraints within the ruling class,[...]\n\nWell, which is it? Does Trump act in the interests of the bourgeoisie viz Russia and China, or not? Or does somebody have \"the goods\" on Trump, and his new warmonger cabinet reflects that?\n\n&gt; The Muller investigation\u2019s broad, open-ended mandate, as one can see with the recent subpoenas, will be able to get hold of the Trump organization\u2019s financial records.

How many people have to choose if they feed their kid or themselves every day? Look at the third world that the first world exploits via first colonialism and next neocolonialism. Hell, even obese people in the first world often times are malnurished even with their surplus of calorie intake because healthier eating out options are null (and when you work 50 hours a week at 2 different jobs you can't really make stay at home food). This addition you've added is so idealistic and detached from reality. Hell, look at the dust bowl: the classic account of farming for a cash crop--environment be damned! \n\nThe constant antagonism of the upper class and lower class of the battle of wages is in 18th-19th century fashion in the third world (arguably worse) and when policies are enacted that make it less profitable for certain country's businesses to be there, they just shut down the factory, leaving hundreds jobless (and starving as a result).\n\n&gt; 32\/33 famine \n\nAfter collectivization, famines in Russia were eradicated. Famines happened before the USSR, and continued until collectivization was passed. Russia was forced by the west to export grain instead if gold prior to the famine as a means of trade which heavily dipped in to the reserves of grain making it more difficult to appease the famine. On top of that, you had capitalists wanting to maintain their powerful position in the previous society by burning crops (starving people). The main point is after collectivization had been put through agriculturally,  famines ceased to be an issue.\n\nPol Pot was hardly the communist the west makes him out to be. He was in direct opposition to socialists in Asia, and frequently denounced Marx and Marxism. In short, he was a cia puppet that assisted in genocide vs the Vietnamese (socialist) people and justified further anti-communist supression by the west, disregarding all nuance that separates him from actual communists (Lenin, Stalin, Mao, etc.).\n\nThe dprk's famine was dealt with.\n\nAs a bonus, would you care to give your definition of a \"totalitarian\" leadership?","created_utc":1522655768,"score":10,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"That may be the thread topic, but the person I was responding to was specifically talking about scholarship. It's very important to counter random grad students on reddit who talk about \"the field\" and the legitimacy their overeducation grants them. \n\nAcademia is an institution which both gives access to education and gives an aura to liberal ideology in service of professionalized intellectuals (particularly against class intellectuals). However, acadeia is still bound by the standards of science, and even the most virulent anti-communism can be countered on its fringes (Grover Furr will never impact the field of Soviet Studies which is in service to the state but it's clear his academic training and tenure protects him and gives him the ability to act as a class intellectual - larger shifts have even happened as in American history for example where racism and liberalism are no longer acceptable in studies of the civil war even though they are common in cultural consciousness). Academia must be approached in a variety of ways for communists, taking into account the progressive nature of science and the reactionary nature of institutionalized scholarship. Gramsci has a lot of interesting things to say on this.\n\nBut because of the general decay of science and critical thought in the West, particularly the anglo-American world (as the result of a general decline in the conditions of the petty-bourgeoisie and labor aristocracy), a whole generation of graduate students who don't belong there and will never get a job exists and is attracted to white supremacist socialism, the last refuge of their class interests. They have no future except using their academic status in the labor market of immaterial labor: social media and blog writing and reddit is a large part of that. This means elevating the aura of academia as the ultimate arbiter of truth without even the legitimacy of science. Basically all the reddit posters on the \"askhistory\/askphilosophy\/askscience\" are of this type and use their valueless academic training as a bludgeon to silence proletarian voices who have questions but don't know the academic language that makes asking such questions acceptable. These people have no real publication record, no theoretical position, no political history, and no field-as-such. When Chang and Halliday spread anti-communist lies, you can attack them by the standards of science and they have a record of scholarship which can be attacked. Instead, these people don't even forward a position because they have none, they merely embody the aura of academia in general against those who do not have access to it.\n\nSince the potential of academia is in its scientific content, these people, desite their self-described socialist beliefs (not surprising when Jacobin is the most attractive job option for mediocre students with no future given that the right is closed to them entirely in the age of Trump) are the true enemies of class intellectuals and communists in general. They should be exposed at all times for the frauds they are and the humbled, the one thing they fear above all since status is the only thing that keeps them from proletarianization.","created_utc":1522867569,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

You cannot recreate the Sanders phenomena from 2 years ago, left alone achieve a book good enough to be considered a new column of the communist movement. Only the revolution and its leaders did it, and not exactly the same way, but because they were actually doing more than just sitting around and trying to find a way to be remarkable. They went there, got themselves organized, started contributing and did the revolution. Left alone that the organizations I mentioned not only do take into consideration the height of imperialism and the contributions of Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Fidel, Che, Ho Chi Minh, Kim Il Sung, etc., but more important: they learned from it and are doing what they should, what they learned to, what those names did.\n\nSo yes, it is a dumb idea.

An idea is merely something that hasn't materialised into the world yet; that means that anything that we can think of making a reality can happen. Do you think revolutions just happened out of no where? That Marx didn't think the same thing? Revolutions start with small actions that grow larger with time and you can bet Marx thought Faurbach said it all, or that Hegel didn't need to be turned on his head, etcetera, but he wrote anyway because he felt he had something to say. You can't preach the marxist doctrine without being consious of your individual responsibility in the revolution. That's what you are. I feel like this is something that needs to be done, some new text similar to the Manifesto is necessary if we are to make the common people, ordinary citizens aware of their exploration, alienation, etcetera, in plain language, with updated insights about 200 years since 1848-- this is something long overdue. \n\nThat being said I think it will take a lot of research, hard labour, passion and time for you or some of your comrades to do something like this.

{"author":"Douglaslyons18","body":"\"The campaign around the sentencing of Turner, it should be stated directly, is lacking entirely in anything that might remotely be described as politically and socially progressive. The feminist professors at Stanford University who have whipped up the campaign against Persky and who are screaming for a harsher sentence for Turner have not bothered to work out the implications of their positions and actions. The focus on \u201cvictims\u2019 rights\u201d\u2014the notion that criminal proceedings are intended to facilitate convictions and satisfy the victim\u2019s desire for revenge rather than ensure a fair trial for the accused\u2014has been a trademark of right-wing legal theorists for decades.\n\nThe American political and media establishment has, through long practice, made a science out of turning tragedies into profitable sensations and political opportunities. The participation of self-described \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cfeminist\u201d and \u201cprogressive\u201d figures in these right-wing campaigns, side-by-side with state prosecutors and the gutter press, only testifies to the disoriented moods that prevail in these circles.\n\nThe intervention of Biden, a leading representative of American imperialism, is deserving of special contempt. This corrupt and long-time bagman for tax-dodging corporate interests in the State of DuPont-Delaware, Biden now pretends to be deeply horrified by the incident that took place at Stanford. Where was his outrage when it emerged that American soldiers\u2014both men and women\u2014were sodomizing and murdering Iraqi prisoners in Abu Ghraib and elsewhere, acting out their sadistic and bloody fantasies? Biden, Congress and the Obama administration have done everything they can to conceal these crimes. No one was reading \u201cimpact letters\u201d from tortured men and their families when a Senate Intelligence Committee report documented widespread torture in CIA \u201cblack sites\u201d\u2014least of all Mr. Biden.\n\nAs for Hillary Clinton, now the Democratic Party\u2019s presumptive nominee for the presidential election, she has devoted special attention to the campaign to abolish the presumption of innocence for men accused of rape. \u201cTo every survivor of sexual assault,\u201d she wrote on Twitter, \u201cYou have the right to be heard. You have the right to be believed. We\u2019re with you.\u201d She later more explicitly rejected the presumption of innocence: \u201cWell, I would say that everybody should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence.\u201d\n\nClinton should know something about how allegations of sexual misconduct can be used for political purposes. In 1998, Republican legislators organized the impeachment campaign on the grounds that Hillary Clinton\u2019s husband was a sexual predator. Did Bill Clinton\u2019s accusers\u2014such as Paula Jones and Jennifer Flowers\u2014have an absolute \u201cright to be believed?\u201d Hillary Clinton then defended her husband against his accusers.\n\nAt the time, the Socialist Equality Party opposed the impeachment campaign\u2014not because we believed in Clinton\u2019s innocence or approved of his behavior. Rather, we understood very well the reactionary political function of the sex scandal in the context of the Republican Party\u2019s attempt to destroy his administration.\n\nHysterical \u201csexual violence\u201d campaigns, such as the one now underway with respect to the Stanford case, are designed to pollute the political atmosphere, prevent an objective and rational discussion of the most pressing issues of war and inequality, and obscure the basic class divisions in society.\"\n\nWhat is your problem with the article?

If she succeeds, she will follow in a long line of celebrities-turned-politicians including Sonny Bono, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jesse Ventura and most notably, Presidents Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump. [...] attempts in last year\u2019s election campaign to create a personality cult out of Theresa May, Britain\u2019s prime minister, failed dismally because she is a shy and reserved person.  [...] A celebrity, by contrast, has the benefit of instant name recognition and knows how to speak directly to the public. Like Reagan before him, Mr Trump uses simple language and expresses issues in black and white terms. [...] The celebrity leader could work if they merely play the role of a front man (or woman); a non-executive chair of the board. Reagan very much played that role in the 1980s. All the difficult decisions can be left to experts. Independent central banks already control many of the levers of economic policy. Other tough areas, like pensions or environment, can be hived off to commissions. Like a reality TV show, the public can then vote for the character they like most to present the show, and vote them off when they get bored. Rather than \u201cKing for a day\u201d, celebrities will be King or Queen for four years. \nThe risk, of course, is that celebrities may not realise their own limitations, and think they are experts, regardless of their lack of knowledge.\"\n\nThe article can be found [here](https:\/\/www.economist.com\/blogs\/buttonwood\/2018\/03\/democracy-and-economics)","created_utc":1522961125,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"aldo_nova","body":"YOU PASTED THE PART AFTER THEY WERE APOLOGIZING FOR THE RAPIST because you can't fucking defend it, like every other rank and file member of that organization:\n\n&gt; One of Turner\u2019s childhood friends, 20-year-old Leslie Rasmussen, a drummer in the indie rock band Good English, wrote what she believed was a confidential letter to the judge defending Turner, praising his character and calling the incident a \u201cmisunderstanding.\u201d This letter resulted in Rasmussen being labeled a \u201crape apologist,\u201d and the band\u2019s next four performances have been canceled by the respective venues.\n&gt; \n&gt; The extraordinary intervention of Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday reveals the political interests that are motivating the media-orchestrated campaign. In an open letter to the victim, Biden solidarized the Obama administration with the campaign against the judge\u2019s sentence. Biden proclaimed his \u201cfurious anger\u201d at what had happened, praising the woman in the case as a \u201cwarrior\u2014with a solid steel spine.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Biden\u2019s intervention is bound up with the political calculations of the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign, which see it as an opportunity to refocus the national political discourse on gender politics\u2014the better to bury popular issues such as social inequality, which generated an unexpected level of support for Clinton\u2019s rival Bernie Sanders and nearly cost her the nomination.\n&gt; \n&gt; What facts are available about the Stanford case are hazy and disputed, as they often are in such cases. On the night in question, two students discovered 20-year-old freshman Brock Allen Turner with the 22-year-old woman on the ground near a trash bin on campus. The woman was partially undressed and unconscious, with Turner on top of her.\n&gt; \n&gt; The woman, whose name has been withheld from the public, says she does not remember the encounter at all. In Turner\u2019s version of events, the two met at a fraternity party earlier that evening, danced, kissed, and held hands. The subsequent sexual encounter, Turner claimed, was consensual. Both were extremely drunk. Certain social and cultural factors\u2014immaturity, alcoholism on college campuses, the phenomenon of fraternity parties\u2014played, as they usually do in such cases, a destructive role.\n&gt; \n&gt; Turner was convicted by a jury of three felony offenses. One may assume that the jury made a conscientious effort to follow the law and arrive at the appropriate verdict. Judge Persky, who heard all the evidence and presided over the entire case through trial, sentenced Turner to six months in prison.\n&gt; \n&gt; In addition to the prison term, Turner will have to register as a sex offender. The combination of three felony convictions, a prison term, and registration as a sex offender has forever and catastrophically altered the life of this 20-year-old youth. His academic career has been ended. Apparently a gifted swimmer, he has no future as an athlete. Moreover, he has been the subject of an unrestrained nationwide hate campaign\u2014with his name, face and home address plastered all over the news and social media for days on end\u2014and he has been denounced as a monster by the vice-president of the United States. **Contrary to the claims of the media, Turner has not gotten off lightly**.\n\nDefending alleged rapist Kevin Spacey: https:\/\/www.wsws.org\/en\/articles\/2017\/11\/01\/spac-n01.html\n\nCalling the metoo movement neo-Puritan!!!:https:\/\/www.wsws.org\/en\/articles\/2018\/01\/31\/cens-j31.html\n\nSupporting women workers in their efforts to share their experience and expose abusers is neo-Puritan!!

Most likely a very large representative democracy. \u201cDemocracy is the road to socialism\u201d -Karl Marx. \n\nOf course, this is all without mentioning the idea of Capitalism somehow not oppressing people. In modern capitalism the ruling class are the rich who decide policy with their major influence. People are oppressed in their economic opportunity instead of their intellectual freedom. In nearly every power system their is oppression as a result of corruption. In Capitalism this is much more likely due to profit based motivations.","created_utc":1522983003,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

I'm gonna remain small and irrelevant if I rely solely on the advanced section.\" kind of thing. The precedence is Mao's practice with the Chungking Negotiations.\n\n------\nMore food for thought (my post from r\/RevPH - https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/RevPH\/comments\/8abicl\/on_the_possible_resumption_of_peace_talks_in_the\/?st=jfo8ur00&amp;sh=231f3afe):\n\nDuterte made clear last year that he wants the NPA reduced to oblivion by the end of 2018. However, a few days ago, he instructed his cabinet to prepare for the resumption of peace talks, with the caveat that it should come with a comprehensive ceasefire agreement.\n\nWhat this shows, actually, is weakness. After three months of heavy fighting, the Philippine Army is losing. We've seen dozens of tactical offensives on the side of the NPA this past three months, most of them successful. Meanwhile, the Philippine Army is largely unsuccessful with their own offensives, despite the huge numbers advantage. The NPA clearly has the support and sympathy of the majority in the countryside that's keeping the AFP blind in the strongest revolutionary bases.\n\nFurthermore, the NPA, despite the \"fake news\" garbage of thousands of surrenderees, is clearly growing. There are already major tactical offensives in other areas outside Mindanao. The urban mass movement is growing, and raising the number of deployed cadres to the countryside. The Third Rectification Movement versus growing tendencies of empiricism and reformism is clearly making a mark, and the gains are being accelerated by an unprecedented social crisis currently roiling the Philippines.\n\nMeanwhile, the Moro secessionist resistance is also growing. Duterte is being besieged by political enemies on all sides. The masses, unlike what paid Facebook trolls would like you to believe, are already disgusted with the regime. Duterte is fast losing his once secure grip to power.\n\nThat is why Duterte wants to resume peace talks. He wants to take on his enemies one by one, and is cleaarly shaken by the growing strength of the people's resistance.\n\nThe CPP knows this. It's not going into peace negotiations ignorant. It has already learned the major lessons from the first peace negotiations with Cory Aquino in the late 1980s, as well as some minor strategic mistakes with the first few rounds of negotiations with the current Duterte regime.\n\nDuterte is losing. The people's war is advancing.

{"author":"ESLTeacher2112","body":"Money isn't everything. GDP means nothing in reality. \n\n  Plus for NK refugees in South Korea, they face a number of problems. Among them is a lack of social mobility caused by attitudes from South Koreans that those from the north are backwards and archaic. The NK dialect of the language also differs enough that defectors find themselves struggling academically, which in turn exacerbates the social mobility issues by trapping them in often menial work and barring them from such things as higher education. \n\nAlso, SK is not the utopia its made out to be- as I've mentioned elsewhere, there exist those who call it Hell Choseon. The work culture there is pretty bad- directorships and CEO positions, as well as other high level work positions, are often held hereditarily or due to your family connections with people. This has created a sort of two class system of the 'golden spoons' as they're called, who are highly privileged, and the rest of society. Add in a culture of long working hours, high expenses in some cities, as well as an overly competitive jobs market and it is no surprise that many young Koreans who are able to do so are simply choosing to leave the country altogether. This is after they've been through the hell of the school system, which places a LOT of pressure on students to perform well to the point where some commit suicide, and the likes of cram schools are a thing. The two class thing is still an issue even here- richer parents will often send their children to hagwons (after school tuition centres), which has left those who perhaps cannot afford the fees for such tuition feeling that they are being placed at a disadvantage simply because of money.

I remember learning how all the problems of nuclear fission are completely politicized and either trivial or a thing of the past. For instance, waste can be recycled which most countries do and anything left is minuscule and can be stored in very safe deep underground where plate tectonics will deal with the rest. And, new reactor designs like liquid salt reactors cannot cause a catastrophic melt down because new reactor designs are based off of passive safety. Meaning the laws of physics and science are used as the safety regulator instead of humans. Eg, salt reactors have a salt plug that melts when temperatures rise too much allowing the fuel to flow to a reservoir to go subcritical. \n\nThe amount of resources for solar panels, hydroelectric, wind, etc is so ridiculous it's not feasible for our current energy demands. Hydroelectric is great for variable load though. Also, fission might as well be renewable because we have at least millions of years of uranium left if using fast breed reactors and possible billions when using other fuels such as thorium. From a physics perspective, the power of the atom is the next stage for civilization of a higher energy level not renewables.\n\nEDIT: given that transmission of electricity is a problem over long distances to say places where there shouldn't be reactors like Japan. Reactors can be used to generate synthetic oil to be burned in say Japan. This would be a carbon neutral process. On the point of Japan, nuclear meltdowns have come down to very very very stupid reasons that are easily avoided. \n\nI apologize if I got something slightly wrong.

{"author":"leftyandzesty","body":"&gt; For instance, waste can be recycled which most countries do and anything left is minuscule and can be stored in very safe deep underground...\n\nHere in Germany we we have around 17k metric tons of nuclear waste. Stuff that we need to store for hundreds of years. Fun thing is, we have no good sites to store that shit. We have the Asse, a previously thought final site for nuclear waste in which about 120k barrels stored. You know what? They will take these barrels out of there because the Asse is not safe.\n\nThat shit is so dangerous that you can't just bury it underground and forget it. \n\n&gt;where plate tectonics will deal with the rest.\n\nyou want what? Just throw it in there and let it get crushed by rock and stone? Doesn't sound safe, doesn't sound safe at all.\n\n&gt;And, new reactor designs like liquid salt reactors cannot cause a catastrophic melt down\n\nMeltdowns are mostly human accidents. And it is good that liquid salt reactors come with a build in safety mechanism. Although it has other problems, for example corrosion. The salt is just gonna chew itself through the piping and gonna leak out. \n\n But i am not talking about meltdowns. I am talking about the waste. Which liquid salt and thorium reactors make no difference, they still produce waste. \n\n&gt;The amount of resources for solar panels, hydroelectric, wind, etc is so ridiculous it's not feasible for our current energy demands.\n\nWhich is really not true. Germany alone is able to generate about a third of their electricity demands through renewables. It even happened on really sunny and windy days that the electricity price dropped into the negative area, because renewables produced in a short amount of time enough to flood the market. \n\nIt IS technically possible.\n\n&gt;From a physics perspective, the power of the atom is the next stage for civilization of a higher energy level not renewables.\n\nJesus Christ, go away with that 50s propaganda. We are not living in a science fiction novel. I don't care if it is \"the next step\", it is dangerous and produces waste that we can't properly handle.\n\n&gt;Reactors can be used to generate synthetic oil\n\nYes, energy conversion in better storagable forms will be important in the future, but we don't need nuclear reactors for that. Literally any energy source would do the job. You could burn oil to produce synthetic oil, would be pointless, but you could do it. \n\n&gt;pretty sure nuclear doesn't create any emissions. \n\nThe burning in of itself doesn't, that's right. But we should count in the mining of the fuel, the building of the facility etc. Just as we should do with any other energy source. If we factor such things in even wind turbines and solarpanels have  non-zero emissions.","created_utc":1523123084,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

I specifically enjoyed the following section on a quick read and will read it more in-depth tomorrow:\n\n&gt; Capitalism was restored in China under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping but more gradually and cunningly by calling it \u201cSocialism with Chinese Characteristics\u201d. Internationally, a vast majority of Marxist Leninists accept that capitalism has been restored in China. But there are still others who plead that the socialist features of China are stronger than what seem to be capitalist features. It is true, however, that China has accepted the imperialist world order, and state capitalism in China is collaborating with growing capitalist sectors, local and foreign. What is in question is China\u2019s place in the global imperialist order... China grew into an economic power owing to its trained and disciplined labour force developed under socialism and by drawing on its large reserve of cheap rural labour seeking to escape rural poverty following the dismantling of the agricultural communes in the 1980s. The rise of the service and finance sectors of Western capitalist countries at the expense of manufacturing helped to transform China into the world\u2019s largest manufacturing economy and largest exporter of manufactured goods. Controlled opening of the economy to foreign capital ensured that China was in control of its industrial development and that its export-driven economy withstood global economic crises better than the capitalist West. But economic growth was accompanied by lack of attention to negative socioeconomic impact, by way of social inequality, economic insecurity, environmental degradation, mass migration to the cities, want of urban housing, corruption and poor industrial relations. For a country still considered to be a developing country in view of its low per capita GDP, the consequences can be grave in the medium and long term... \nSome are firm in the belief that there are imperialisms besides the US-led imperialist camp. Others argue that emerging capitalist economies are potentially imperialist. There are also differences in opinion about which capitalist economies are imperialist or close to becoming imperialist or potentially imperialist. Such differences are relevant to the extent that the impact of any capitalist country on oppressed nations and people and implications for the anti-imperialist campaign and the socialist cause","created_utc":1523153252,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

This means that it's not even about maximizing their [the super rich's] happiness, it turns in to a compulsive \"disorder\" of grabbing for more and more money without gaining anything from it aside from more commodities, or more mop to get more wealth (which is more likely). I don't think these people are unhappy necessarily, but I do think they \"\"need\"\" more to get the same rush-- or the same \"fix\"-- as they did before. To elaborate, when you go from 50k a year to 75k a year, that 15k is a huge difference enough to qualify for a change in your daily life. When you get to the point of making, say, 500k, that 15k is far less substantial, and to gain that level of pleasure you previously got from a deal, you'd need to get a proportional amount of money from an investment return or something. I remember listening to a lecture where a psychologist was remembering interviewing some millionare in the 1950s, and the millionare said \"What else am I to do?\" when confronted with the question \"Why do you do it if it's not making you happy anymore?\" The millionare had severed his relationship with his family for money, with any kind of emotional attachment he could have with another person as human beings for the sake of the pursuit of profit, and without it he was completely lost. I'll PM you the lecture (admittedly, it wasn't a lecture on psychology, but it was a psychologist giving the lecture) if you're interested. \n\nNow this doesn't mean it excuses their weight on the zero sum game, and it doesn't excuse the poverty others have to go through to get his rocks off, but I just wanted to contribute to \"a certain amount of wealth causes mental issues\" take you were putting down. I think as communists and as organizers it's important to understand that we are human and the appeal of wealth or getting bought out is a powerful temptation (like trade unions getting bought out by corporations for example) that we will have to resist as the movement gains more traction and class collaborationism becomes more common place.

{"author":"1krix2krix","body":"The video got a lot of attention from both enthusiastic supporters as well as trolls supporting the sellout NGOists who got caught in bed with the developers. Here's the text of a follow-up [statement](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/servethepeopleaustin\/posts\/937868739720645) about it from Serve the People - Austin:\n\n&gt; We would like to take an opportunity to respond to some criticisms of the disruption of the Project Catalyst meeting posted as live video on our page.\n\n&gt; 1\\. \"You sound like a fascist when you say people can\u2019t have a platform to speak.\" We absolutely believe that there are people, including developers and fascists, who should not be allowed a platform to speak. Our goal is not to uphold some set of moral values like the golden rule. We are a political organization with political objectives. We have seen how shutting up fascists across the country has been successful at undermining their agenda (look at how Richard Spencer or Milo Yiannopoulos have been effectively made irrelevant through disruptions). We and others are applying that same tactic to the anti-gentrification struggle here in Austin. The mindset of developers is the exact opposite of ours. We want things that are mutually exclusive: they want to make a profit, we want to protect working class communities. Their profit necessitates displacing those communities, and so we honestly don't give a shit what they have to say. We do not dream of a world where developers, fascists, and everyone else all give each other a chance to speak. We are striving for a world with NO developers and NO fascists, and the first step towards that is refusing them the right to speak.\n\n&gt; 2\\. \"These people represent violence and that's not cool.\" Yelling or cursing may be somewhere on the spectrum of violence, but it is surely on the opposite side of the spectrum compared to the widespread violence that has been and continues to be carried out against the working class communities of Austin in the form of police brutality, school segregation, displacement, etc. As far as representing violence in Austin, how can our taunts and jeers compete with the land theft, mass destruction of homes, and cultural erasure that gentrification leaves in its wake? Critics who label us violent would probably agree that gentrification is also violent, so why do they reprimand us for our \"violence\" and not the agents of gentrification (like developers) for their violence? Frankly, we believe it is because they don't believe gentrification can be stopped, whereas trying to defame a small group like us seems more doable. To side with us means to go against the current, to fight back against the powerful capitalists, politicians, and hipsters that make gentrification possible. Taking up that struggle demands discipline, courage, and resolve. Siding against us means aligning with the status quo and joining the ranks of those who believe that gentrification is inevitable, that power is forever sanctioned to those who already have it and cannot be found among the people, and that those facing displacement should be content with exile if they can get some chump change to make up for dropping the lives they have made for themselves in Austin. Taking that road is seemingly safer and doesn't take much effort. Finally, we believe there is a fundamental difference between state-sanctioned violence and violence done in self-defense against an oppressor. It is right to rebel!\n\n&gt; 3\\. \"You are the gentrifiers! Respect your elders!\" - We take this criticism to mean that some people who were causing the disruption don't look like the people who are historically from the neighborhood, and that white activists should follow the lead of older people of color. It is true that some of our members are white and that some did not grow up in Austin. However, if we were gentrifiers, why would we be so outspoken against gentrification? Once again, the answer to the contradiction of this criticism lies in the assumption that putting an end to gentrification is impossible. To them, our struggle appears to be a hopeless cause that can only serve to sabotage their ability to negotiate for the crumbs that the system currently offers. For a more comprehensive outline of why we believe reversing gentrification is possible, please read Free The Land (https:\/\/issuu.com\/defendourhoodz\/\u2026\/digitalgentrificationzine), which we co-wrote with Defend Our Hoodz - Defiende El Barrio - Austin, but suffice it to say that we are following the historical models of communities around the world (many of whom are not white) who have successfully fought back against their oppressors.\n\n&gt; As for respecting elders, our policy has always been that above all, we respect a person or a group based on what they do, not what they look like or what they say. In particular, one comment said that we should respect Susana Almanza, the president of the Montopolis Contact Team and the director of nonprofit PODER. We are aware of community work that Almanza has done in the past that has earned her a reputation, including her environmental study that helped close the Holly Power Plant that was polluting the surrounding working class communities. We are also aware of her more recent work, like how she undermined the Cactus Rose community from organizing against their displacement (instead of supporting a resolution the community association had drafted, she accused outsiders of writing it and instead proposed her own resolution that put a modest price tag on the cost of relocating the residents) or how she facilitated the speedy displacement of the Thrasher Lane Mobile Home park. A former Thrasher tenant was quoted in an Austin Chronicle story as saying that Almanza was on the side of the developers during the negotiations (https:\/\/www.austinchronicle.com\/\u2026\/life-after-gentrification\/). Almanza may have once been a fighter for the community, but for whatever reason her current politics reflect cynicism and opportunism that we absolutely do not respect. Her misguided leadership has corrupted many activists in Austin, many who have the potential to be true fighters for the people. We hope that by exposing her shady dealings and criticizing her dead-end politics we can liberate some of these folks out from under her wing.\n\n&gt; 4\\. \"You are alienating the community by being so aggressive!\" We no doubt expect that some people will be alienated by our tactics. If you watch the video, you can see some people leave. However, you can also see in the video many people from the crowd calling out the developers false promises and eventually yelling the developers present out of the building. These expressions of people power would not have been possible if the meeting had gone as planned. We recognize that the revolutionary movement is still in its early stages in Austin, and we also know it will take many years to build that movement to a size that is actually capable of enforcing real change. With that in mind, we hope that our tactics now will inspire the leaders of tomorrow. We are not trying to corral working class people to city hall for a public hearing for a short-lived and empty demonstration of people power. We want longlasting and explosive people power capable of fundamentally changing society. We do not wish for this idealistically either. We know from historical example it is possible to organize for more than small concessions. We want to go all the way. We want to organize working class leadership that will liberate us from the gentrifiers and the capitalists who back them. We are not interested in band-aid solutions. We want to cure the disease. At this meeting, we and others pulled the veil from what appeared to be a cordial presentation among equals to show its true nature: predators (the developers) baiting their prey (the people). Yes, we know that our loud and proud manner of speaking scared some people away, but we also know that those who remained had an opportunity to see developers and their agents treated for what they are: enemies of the people. Understanding that we have class enemies and identifying who they are is a crucial first step in traveling the revolutionary road.\n\n&gt; Finally, we would also like to acknowledge that in addition to the criticisms on the post, many commenters voiced support for the action and also shared their experiences of fighting gentrification. The overall positive response to the action emboldens us. The developers of Austin should be quaking in their boots, because this is just the beginning.","created_utc":1523210358,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

Hayek said government regulation would bring us back to serfdom. Didn't happen. Friedman said capitalism would end poverty worldwide; most poverty reduction has been in China under a system many can't even agree on, but can't really be called \"free market capitalism\".

In fact, it's hard to differentiate his government from FHC's, both were very similar policy-wise and economically. Second, when did he went against US imperialism? First thing he did after being elected was writing the infamous [\"letter to the Brazilian people\"](http:\/\/www1.folha.uol.com.br\/folha\/brasil\/ult96u33908.shtml) (in fact a \"letter to Washington\"), promising not to undo what FHC had done and promising to keep up with Brazil's \"obligations\". His project was always a project of continued subservience. He threw our people into the fire for US imperialism. Remember, Bush and Obama loved him, and the US banks did too.\n\nAnd third, since when do we want UBI? UBI is a libertarian policy, so is Bolsa Fam\u00edlia. A tiny handout that keeps people *barely* fed. No industrial development, no employment. Did our standards drop so low that we're considering this the *left*? \n\nSure Bolsonaro is \"openly\" fascistic, but that's to be expected. PT was covertly fascistic.

I mean, wtf do you think embargoes are designed to do?  If communism fails on its own, why the fuck does the American government do everything in its power to make it happen.\n\nNow onto your shit source (Reason...really...embarrassing).  The source for communism comes from [here](http:\/\/necrometrics.com\/all20c.htm) according the publicly available [spreadsheet](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1vHTUaPWwlCPCg4O5YvDFRuDOCA8xX2ERnJQImnps6sk\/edit#gid=16) which then references \"The Black Book of Communism\".  \"The Black Book of Communism\" is universally regarded as an absolute shit source even by bourgeois historians.  In fact, it is so bad that half of its authors have since denounced it.  I mean, it includes criminal executions (like for rapists and murderers), killing Nazis, famines due to drought, war time deaths, etc... but you will note that your shit source doesn't do the same for capitalism.  For example, it doesn't lump in the 2-7 million deaths due to famines in India during Churchill's military occupation as \"deaths due to capitalism\".   It appears to leave out a lot of deaths due to capitalism and organizes them under different categories.  But everything that happened under communism, be it due to natural disaster, disease,  or foreign invasion or revolution, as \u201cdeaths due to communism\".  Notice that it conveniently ignores the 19th century - you know the one where capitalist countries accumulated the capital necessary to industrialize through land theft, genocide, slavery, etc...   \n\nYour sources are a joke.  Start researching primary sources and stop listening to what bourgeois scum tell you.\n\nEdit:  Similar methods that were used to get the 100M number for communism applied to [capitalism](http:\/\/guerrillaontologies.com\/2014\/05\/attempting-the-impossible-calculating-capitalisms-death-toll\/).","created_utc":1523325199,"score":9,"subreddit":"communism"}

Saddam invaded Iran on behalf of the imperialist countries to overthrow its revolution (and even only invaded Kuwait because he thought he had permission from the US.) Noriega used drug money to help finance the Contras. Milo\u0161evi\u0107, a banker, was initially seen as a man amenable to IMF-imposed \"reforms\" of austerity and mass privatization.\n\nBut at the end of the day, none of that matters. We oppose imperialism not because a leader leads tens of thousands of citizens to chant \"death 2 AmeriKKKa\" or whatever every day, but because the goal of imperialism is to weaken and, if possible, overthrow any government which does not fully align with the interests of the international financial system. Thus Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was denounced for refusing to privatize his country at a speed and extent desired by the West. Noriega was denounced for having relatively cordial relations with Cuba and being insufficiently hostile to the Sandinistas. Assad, father and son alike, were still at odds with Israel, Turkey, and other imperialist allies in the Middle East. Saddam remained the principal supporter of the PLO.\n\nAnd we see what happened in each case. In Panama the US imposed a crippling embargo that forced the government to cut social services, and when that failed to overthrow Noriega the US responded by invading the country, bombing working-class neighborhoods because \"Noriega loyalists\" supposedly resided among the workers. Following the establishment of \"democracy\" the new government embraced neo-liberal \"reforms\" and was similarly guilty of the sort of drug trafficking involvement that had been used as a pretext to overthrow Noriega in the first place, only now it didn't matter because the new government was a reliable ally of imperialism.\n\nYugoslavia likewise was the victim of sanctions that collapsed industrial production and health services, impoverishing the people as a way to either incite them to overthrow Milo\u0161evi\u0107 or get the latter to submit to further \"reforms\" for the imperialist countries. The subsequent NATO bombing of this country, that was scarcely able to put up any resistance, resulted in thousands of deaths. The bombs not only destroyed infrastructure, but specifically targeted state-owned enterprises while leaving those in private hands largely untouched.\n\nIraq followed a reverse pattern: first bombs were dropped to destroy infrastructure (to such an extent a United Nations report declared that \"Iraq has, for some time to come, been relegated to a pre-industrial age\") and then sanctions were imposed. Within five years these led to the deaths of half a million children (not to mention many adults), which Secretary of State Albright said was \"worth it\" for the singular hope of forcing Saddam's downfall. Ordinary Iraqis constantly told Western journalists how they regarded the sanctions as incomprehensible. They strengthened Saddam insofar as an impoverished population was unable to organize against the government, and it seemed elementary common sense that Saddam and his associates weren't suffering, whereas the many millions of Iraqis were.\n\nThis is because the goal of the imperialists wasn't to make Saddam \"suffer,\" it was to cripple Iraq as a country, preventing it from exercising any regional influence and depressing the wages and living standards of the population in order to better prepare the way for international investors at a later date.\n\nMany leaders end up asking for forgiveness. Gaddafi's government assumed responsibility for the Lockerbie bombing despite not being responsible because, in the words of Libya's Prime Minister at the time, \"After the sanctions and after the problems we [have] been facing because of the sanctions, the loss of money, we thought that it was easier for us to buy peace, and this is why we agreed a compensation. We said, let us buy peace, let us put the whole thing behind us, and let us move forward.\" Gaddafi himself was seemingly rehabilitated by the imperialist countries as a responsible statesman throughout the 2000s, and he praised the election of a \"son of Africa\" to the US Presidency. Yet the imperialists never truly regarded him as an ally, and after four decades of failure finally managed to overthrow him in 2011, with all the misery this has entailed for the Libyan people.\n\nFinally, there is a point made by Michael Parenti in regard to the socialist countries: \"Our policymakers have argued that right-wing governments, for all their 'deficiencies,' are friendly toward us, while Communist ones are belligerent and therefore a threat to US security. But every Marxist or left-leaning country, be it a great power like the Soviet Union or small powers like Vietnam, Cuba, Angola, and Nicaragua, or a mini-power like Grenada (under the New Jewel Movement), has sought friendly diplomatic and economic relations with the USA. They do so not necessarily out of love for the United States but because of a self-interested desire not to be menaced by US military power, and to enjoy the opportunities of trade that come with friendly relations. As they themselves point out, their economic development and political security would be much better served if they could improve relations with Washington.\" He gives as an example, \"Between 1981 and 1984 alone, the Reagan administration passed up at least four initiatives by the Cuban government to normalize relations.\" (The Sword and the Dollar, 1989, p. 89.) Bruce Cumings in North Korea: Another Country gives examples of the DPRK's efforts at negotiations throughout the 90s for the normalization of relations and even an agreement to keep US troops in South Korea.\n\nThe \"anti-anti-imperialists\" repeat the caricatures created by imperialism when it comes to any government that, for whatever reason, finds itself at odds with the imperialist countries. Castro, Gaddafi, Saddam, Mugabe and others (doesn't matter if they are socialists or bourgeois nationalists) are portrayed as having an abnormal, indeed \"pathological\" hatred of the West, while those of us who are against imperialist war are likewise portrayed as having the same \"pathological\" aversion to \"our own\" countries. Yet because these \"anti-anti-imperialists\" also pose as leftists, they are able to turn around and express indignation when these leaders call on the imperialists to end their aggressive policies in exchange for normal relations and concessions. Suddenly the \"rabidly anti-American\" leader is portrayed by these faux-leftists as hypocritical.\n\nAs Marxists, we know that in a world where the imperialists feel they can sanction, bomb, and overthrow governments whenever they consider it best to do so, such \"hypocrisy\" from governments targeted by imperialism is simply good sense, and that while a bourgeois government may opportunistically try to \"strike a deal\" with imperialism and ally with it for some purpose (as noted above: Iraq against Iran, Panama financing the Contras), the mere fact that the leadership exercises some independence from imperialism will always make it a target and will always threaten to embroil both the people of the oppressed and oppressor countries in conflicts and wars.\n\nBy opposing the efforts of the imperialists to destroy the economic life of any country that does not perfectly align with them, by opposing civil wars waged by reactionaries and financed by imperialism against governments that find themselves at odds with imperialist domination, we actually defend the thesis that \"the emancipation of the working classes must be conquered by the working classes themselves.\" We build class consciousness by informing people as to the nature of imperialism here at home and its inseparable link to the capitalist system, while successful opposition to imperialism forces bourgeois-nationalist governments abroad to contend with the legitimate demands of their own working people, who will not have to call these demands off in the face of imperialist-imposed privations and deaths from starvation, disease and war.","created_utc":1523366904,"score":13,"subreddit":"communism"}

Those private businesses are not affected by the embargo (they can buy from anywhere).

I personally think that Cuba is doing better than those countries, and I think that it is because of socialism that it's doing better.\n\nLastly I know in my native Kenya, it's worse than Cuba although Kenya is bigger and with a greater population, and also has more natural resources. For example in Kenya the average person makes more than the average Cuban, however medical care is very expensive and schooling is very expensive.

Nonetheless, he also said that at some point, Vietnam will have to go back to how it was before 1986, otherwise agriculture will never be mechanized. His logic is essentially the same as Lenin's justification for the NEP. And I know anecdotes can't replace scientific investigation, based on personal experience I would guess this is how most veterans, or even most Vietnamese people see the market reforms. After all, the market reforms in Vietnam were not imposed from the top as an attack on the masses, they were the result of the demands of the peasantry (the majority of Vietnam's population) and hence *democratically* put into place.\n\n\nSo rest assured, perception of the market reforms as a form of \"betrayal\" is a non-issue.

{"author":"whatsunoftruth","body":"You're an expat from an oppressor nation. I highly doubt that you came to Vietnam to work on the rice fields or the factories in Vietnam's rural provinces. I would also have a guess that you make a living either by working in FDI enterprises or being an English teacher, with an income that allows you to have a top-tier standard of living, exceeding that of most Vietnamese people. All of this shapes your experience in several ways:\n\n\n1. During your time in Vietnam, you'll most likely stay in the more well off areas of big cities (Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City) - the population of which would mostly be composed of English speaking capitalists &amp; petty bourgeois intellectuals. The factories are built in industrial zones, located in the suburbs; and agriculture is obviously located in the countryside. Most Vietnamese people you encounter, would be rich Vietnamese capitalists and white collar professionals. And hearing them talk about the Vietnamese government is almost as bad as hearing Miami Cubans talk about revolutionary Cuba. For instance, how could rich Vietnamese people formulate a valid opinion about the Vietnamese health insurance system, when they never had to rely on it? Shouldn't he poor patients in less wealthy provinces, whose lives were saved by the free coverage be the ones to hear from? Or, how could wealthy white collar professionals have any valid opinions about Vietnamese armed forces - who they condemn to be \"corrupt\", when they never had to live in areas damaged by natural disasters. In these areas, the armed forces are mobilized to help evacuate the people, protect personal property, build dykes, harvest crops, rebuild houses, etc...  The farmers who were timely evacuated thanks to the effort and the organization of the armed forces, the poor patients that rely on the state health insurance program; those are the people you won't encounter. And even if you do, there's the language barrier. Worse still, their voices aren't represented on the internet. The benefits Vietnamese socialism is completely invisible to bourgeois Vietnamese people, and it can only be even more invisible to the eyes of foreigners.\n\n\n2. The big cities are places where capitalist influence is usually the strongest. Hence, all the capitalist related social ills would be stronger as well - this includes corruption. As expats mostly spend time in big cities, you'll disproportionately hear about the (negative) experience of city dwellers with corruption, creating the impression that Vietnam is more corrupt than it really is.\n\n\n3. You yourself is part of the 1st World petty bourgeoisie, and this shapes how you view the world, specifically how you perceive and not perceive certain things. This is a very good article that discusses this: https:\/\/monthlyreview.org\/2010\/04\/01\/how-to-visit-a-socialist-country\/\n\n\nHaving said that, corruption is definitely a nation-wide issue, despite the fact that the severity varies depending on the province. But it's not like the CPV doesn't address this issue honestly, and people openly criticizes corruption too. \n\n\nAs for \"Vietnamese people neither know nor care much about politics\", I would say that's non-sense. Elected officials have to attend mandatory accountability sessions (this is known as \"congress of constituents\"). People attend these sessions and discusses issues that *actually affects them*, like infrastructure, poverty reduction programs, corruption at the local level, legislation on healthcare and education, etc... Somehow this doesn't count as \"politics\". So when you hear some Vietnamese people say that, it really means \"Vietnamese people don't care about my petty bourgeois political concerns, like 'free speech', 'multi-party democracy' or who Radio Free Asia speculates to be the next General Secretary\". \n","created_utc":1523384846,"score":27,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"amerikkkan_alien","body":"the way imperial war is conducted has changed in nature (I call it neo-imperialism\/neo-colonialism) while overall public consciousness on social issues has drastically reset since the 70's. Your question can be explained by exploring both of those issues. Another reason for example is the US's war in Vietnam was a concrete and solid war which had two clear opposing sides. It was Amerikkka Vs. the Vietnamese people and couldn't be framed as much else, even if it was the public knew we were practically fighting the people of Vietnam. Due to neo-imperialism, the modern age of digital media, and a lack of overall consciousness on the public's part these wars have been justified to the public. Most of these wars are going on in the middle east and the public assues we are fighting terrorism, they make up lies such as chemical weapons are being used and a regime change is quickly justified to the American public. The way US authorizes war has drastically changed since 9\/11 as well, it isn't a declaration of war like it used to be. US has drone warfare, dropping of bombs by unmanned vehicles, etc. US has been in so many wars since 9\/11 yet no one seems to really understand and call them actual wars. They are all grouped under \"War on Terror\/Middle East.\" Social movements during the 70's were the highest they had ever been, after FBI program \"COINTELPRO\" and the rise of neo-liberalism social movements were put down and the mass consciousness in America was dulled. I believe neo-liberalism (Reagan, Clinton, Obama, Hillary) as a huge reason for why we won't see any strong anti-war movements specifically in the US.  Many liberals (actually neo-liberals) have been completely brainwashed and deceived by President Obama and his tactics of conducting imperial war. Also the average Amerikkkan gives no fucks about what happening in the rest of the world, even if many of them knew the truth; it's likely they would not care. Many of these same Amerikkkans could care less that African Americans are being shot and killed by police on a daily basis, why would they care about some brown muslim kids in a middle eastern country?","created_utc":1523412407,"score":10,"subreddit":"communism"}

Our comrades in the Third World have already begun fighting in the protracted people's war in several countries worldwide. We must aid them, to be a communist is to be an optimist by nature. That is a loose quote from Huey P newton, we wouldn't be communists if we didn't think some type of revolution was possible within the near future. Maybe not full communism but a change is imminent, that is why those in power are so scared and willing to do anything to ward of revolution. Why do you think the FBI created COINTELPRO? Why did they assassinate our leaders such as Malcolm X, Huey P Newton, Fred Hampton, &amp; MLK Jr just to name a few? The threat is real to them, revolution is a real possibility. Just look at how history has progressed until now, scientific socialism wasn't created too long ago, the first implementation of scientific socialism was slightly over a 100 years ago. From there the theory has only been expanded upon and improved. Mao's death was less than 50 years ago... It is only a matter of time, even if a war is to come, that might even speed up the process of revolution. Sure the damage to our earth has already been done, but the earth is a remarkable planet that will heal itself over hundreds of thousands of years with or without our help. All we can do is play our part to save the earth, we will save and preserve the environment only through revolution as the capitalist are intent on hoarding all resources to themselves and destroying the planet in the process.

Obama happened, then Trump happened, then Russiagate. \n\nThe Obama era lead to a demobilization of the anti-war movement as humanitarianism became the main casus belli and the interventionists adopted a liberal face. Propaganda became more suited almost specifically to preempt criticism of the wars. This had the effect of dividing and confusing the movement, because in the heat of reports like the one about Libyan soldiers taking viagra to rape women and children, many refused to see through the appeal to \"protect\" civilians. I remember a pretty big attitude shift in 2011 by people who just a few years before had opposed the wars. Around the same time, we started seeing all kinds of articles bemoaning the \"pro-authoritarian\" and \"anti-imp\" problem, like Louis Proyect's constant stream of garbage in Counterpunch. So I'd say the Arab Spring, and specifically Libya, was the tipping point where not only support for actions that amounted to regime change, but conscious anti-anti-imperialism became acceptable on parts of the left. Syria intensified this pattern of thinking, leading to open support for an attack to depose Assad. I distinctly remember an article on Counterpunch denouncing the left for lacking the \"moral courage\" to stand with the people of Syria, or some such. In 2017, one of the criticisms of Trump from Socialist Worker after the cruise missile strike was that he wasn't serious enough about helping the Syrian Revolution. \n\nSince a major part of Trump's appeal to his base and to independents was questioning the enterprise in Syria, it's become fashionable to try to associate antiwar arguments with the alt-right. And especially with the anti-Russia scare, many liberals think Russia is behind all \"anti-American\" forces, like the antiwar movement. They think Trump is soft on Russia, and since they want to oppose anything he does, or allegedly does, they support bombing Assad and more military spending to overpower Russia. To put this in perspective, far from being antiwar in principle, for a lot of liberals, Obama's main fault in his foreign policy was not going far enough. \n\nJust an example of how the left has grown while sacrificing some of its independence from the media and the Democratic party, you can't say anything bad about, say, the Venezuelan opposition on r\/socialism without a vocal minority trying to attack you as a Russian puppet.

So my initial curiosity is *where* Marx would believe the material conditions for capitalism are apt.\n\nFor one, a certain level of economic propserity is necessary for this 'wealth' to be distributed according to each's needs. Secondly, there must be no immediate threat from the outside world - for example, one of the main points of certain interpretations of communism is that the proletariat controlled state must first defend itself from enemy states who wish to seek it destroyed, and this is an example of why some so-called communist states are the equivalent of state capitalist dictatorships - they believe the stage of capitalism must be sped through by state controlled economics, and that the state is necessary as a defense against imperialistic nations that wish to destroy anyone not willing to become a part of the international capitalistic system.\n\nAgain, if anyone wants to clear up what I'm saying I'm only partially certain about these comments; I'm open to correction, but I wish to provide the redditor I am commenting to with the information that I believe to be correct, based on my readings and education over the years.\n\nI'm glad we're having a conversation at the very least.

In fact, the only resistance to this latest push for war in Syria and anti-Russia hysteria has been on the right, the liberal anti-war left was completely defeated by Sanders's war mongering on behalf of American labor.  Of course this can never be real anti-imperialism, but the point is that both Sanders and Trump appeal to the same class interests, the difference being the former is in alliance with the petty-bourgeois (giving it a liberal character) while the latter is in alliance with a large faction of big business (making it conservative). DSA, Sanders, Greens, \"our revolution\" Democrats, these all represent the same class and are extremely aggressive on imperialism, exactly the same as New Deal democrats and JFK anti-communist SDS socialists.\n\nThe difference with Corbyn is striking, though labor as a party is completely pro-imperialist. This should tell you about the particular warping effect settlerism has on the left in this country.","created_utc":1523425240,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

(Unless you know better or have a to interaction with the military.) War to my age group and younger is something that happens to people of color, far away. All of my peers are that are still liberal have a vague idea we enter conflicts for oil, but it seems like theres not a lot of sympathy engendered for those victims of US Imperialism. I know that for even slightly older leftists there budding (from liberalism at least) into more radical forms of leftism came from a reaction to rather illuminating American aggression. \n\nMaybe the the disassociation stems from a sort of inoculation of knowing US hedgemony has never been justified, so us younger lefties never experienced the death\/fraud of the idea that America is the bearer of 'Freedom' and 'Democracy'. And thus don't believe our government would stop their global conquest no matter how hard we theoretically protested.\n \nAnecdotally after the April 2017 missile attack on Syria I went to an anti war on Syria rally my first specifically anti war rally since Bush, that was very poorly attended.

{"author":"ASocialistAbroad","body":"It's kind of hard to answer \"what it's like\" in a country. I also will not try to grade how socialist it is since socialism always looks different in different places and since I would miss plenty of relevant context. Speaking of context, it's important to note that my living situation greatly influences my experiences. I live relatively well-off in a city (H\u1ea3i Ph\u00f2ng), and though my Vietnamese is improving, the only people I can hold complex conversations with are people who speak sufficiently good English.\n\nThe Good: People are friendly and helpful. Just about any store will let you use their WiFi if you ask, whether you're buying anything or not. Despite being from the country responsible for systematically destroying entire villages, spraying chemical defoliants through the countryside, and viciously bombing H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i and H\u1ea3i Ph\u00f2ng a mere 50 years ago, I encounter virtually no hostility directed toward me (at least openly). The people I've encountered seem to have no enmity toward the people of any other race or country--except China, but I'll get back to that later--and while some of my foreign colleagues have mentioned curious stares or little kids randomly trying to touch them, none have mentioned detecting any hostility from locals. Women's rights are in pretty good shape; lots of women work, and women have the same legal rights as men. Locals are often excited when I talk to them in Vietnamese (I'd rank myself around high beginner or pre-intermediate level), a stark contrast from how foreigners in English-speaking countries often face hostility if their English isn't good enough. Vietnam has the fastest-growing economy in the region. The food here is delicious and healthy, and I've lost a fair bit of weight since getting here (I hope I'm not eating too little or something, but I think I'm in good shape).\n\nThe Bad: There is a lot of pollution in the cities. The government has a corruption problem, and most locals I've talked to have a very negative view of their government in light of this fact. The police take bribes for traffic violations (an alternate perspective I've heard from a local is that the police do not ask for bribes; they simply accept them when offered and would be very poorly paid without the bribes). Sometimes, it feels like the people around me know more about my government simply by knowing the US President's name than they do about their own government. It's kind of hard for me to learn much about their political system in practice when almost no locals I've talked to seem to know much themselves. While a certain amount of anger at China is understandable given the dispute in the South China Sea (the East Sea in Vietnam), it is almost cartoonish what some of the people around me sometimes say in order to demonize Chinese people, with frequent references to the Chinese occupation of Vietnam that ended about 1,000 years ago. Conspiracy theories of China intentionally selling horrible or even poisonous products to Vietnam abound. It should be noted that a fair number of people I know are able to separate their feelings about Chinese people from their feelings about China, but many others make no such distinction. Vegetarians can have trouble finding food that isn't at least cooked with animal at some point in the process. People with pet dogs often have to worry about their pets being stolen and sold to th\u1ecbt ch\u00f3 (dog meat) restaurants.","created_utc":1523428922,"score":9,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"whatsunoftruth","body":"A lot of things happened. I learned more in terms of theory, and as a result I began to see how my opinions about Vietnam were an incoherent mess. Becoming more well versed in theory also changed how I interpret certain data that I misinterpreted before (for instance, I knew that the state sector accounts for 1\/3 of Vietnam's GDP. As it turns out, that doesn't mean private capitalists contributes to 2\/3 of the GDP, meaning Vietnam is capitalist and no more discussion is needed. It's not that simple). Aside from that, I took the time to seriously investigate contemporary Vietnam: looking into more statistics, reading the laws, researching about how the Vietnamese political system functioned in rural provinces, etc... instead of relying on my bourgeois personal experience and my \"intuitions\". As I do more research, it became evident that many of my beliefs aren't fact-based in any way, and were actually born out of the remnants of liberalism in my way of thinking. Most importantly, I learned about the true face of capitalism in the global South. I realized that there were a lot things about Vietnam that I took for granted. In that sense, I was no different to ultra-leftists who carelessly claimed the USSR was capitalist, since their privilege protected them from the worst aspects of capitalism. \n\n\nNonetheless, I would by lying if I said personal experience played no role in changing my mind. For example, I was young and stupid enough to produce anti-CPV propaganda, and when it was perceived as reactionary it started to make me re-think my politics. I also got exposed to more of the ridiculousness of the 1st World left (mostly through the internet): I had countless Trotskyists telling me that the Communist Party of Vietnam \"dissolved itself as a gesture of goodwill towards French imperialism\", or how \"Ho Chi Minh betrayed the cause, collaborated with imperialists to slaughter workers and peasants\". Suddenly, \"revisionism\" in Vietnam doesn't seem so bad anymore. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAs for the sources, \"modern Vietnam\" as a topic is really wide. So it would be easier to give you recommendations if you narrow it down a bit. On the top of my head, here are some sources that could answers the frequently asked questions about Vietnam: \n\n\nGeneral Statistics Office of Vietnam - this is for looking at statistics, fairly useful if you want to look into the state of Vietnam's current economy: https:\/\/www.gso.gov.vn\/Default_en.aspx?tabid=491\n\n\nBecause I've seen many people ask about social services in Vietnam: \n\n\nLaw on Health Insurance: http:\/\/www.moj.gov.vn\/vbpq\/en\/lists\/vn%20bn%20php%20lut\/view_detail.aspx?itemid=10507 \n\n\n2014 amendments of the health insurance law: http:\/\/www.iexpertvn.com\/2015\/01\/law-no-462014qh13-amendments-to-law-on.html\n\n\nLaw on Social Insurance (For work-related accidents, unemployment, maternity leave and pension): http:\/\/www.molisa.gov.vn\/en\/Pages\/Detail-document.aspx?vID=635\n\n\nLaw on Education: http:\/\/www.moj.gov.vn\/vbpq\/en\/lists\/vn%20bn%20php%20lut\/view_detail.aspx?itemid=5484\n\n\nA flawed defense of Vietnam - but an excellent starting point for Western leftists:\n\n https:\/\/return2source.wordpress.com\/2013\/01\/08\/actually-existing-socialism-in-vietnam\/\n\n\nOther than that, I suppose I can provide photos and footage of Vietnamese socialism in practice, but nothing academic I'm afraid. I'm also hesitant to recommend the English version of Vietnamese online news sites, since they often try to project a certain image of Vietnam (e.g friendly towards investors), which can only skew your perception, and thus would do more harm than good when you're trying to learn about the country. The language barrier really makes it difficult, there are plenty of other sources in Vietnamese but they're not translated into English. Of course, I myself could try and answer whatever questions about Vietnam that might pop up in communist subreddits, but at the end of the day, I'm just an internet commenter. Nothing is comparable to reading the original source by yourself.\n\n\n\n","created_utc":1523462061,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

Nor am I saying it is because they are American, a lot of very good journalists are American. What doesn't make it credible is that they would meet with Hitler and used photos from past famines. It's kinda rich saying I'm not backing things up, when neither are you. At the moment I am criticising a source that you haven't even provided. \n\nThe famine wasn't localised to where the nationalists were either, it mainly struck the centre and east Ukraine. Also, you were the one that origanally claimed it was against the peasants? I'm not saying it was just the Kulaks that suffered, but that it was caused partially by their actions. I'm not denying that it effected a wide range of people. \n\nhttps:\/\/stalinsocietygb.wordpress.com\/2016\/02\/17\/the-ukrainian-famine-genocide-myth\/ this is a very good article in the matter. \n\nI don't know why people get upset about the purges, which were Lenin's idea. they were done infront of a public audience as to remain democratic. It's simply like being sacked from your job. Many of those who ended up being sent to Gulags (which *was not* all of them) were fascist sympathisers. I honestly have no sympathy for them.\n\nThe Gulags were pretty progressive for their time too. Unlike in the UK, USA and other imperialist powers, there was no solitary confinement and prisoners were allowed a 2 week holiday for good behaviour. At the height of the Gulags in the 1930s the death rate was 5%, today in America it is 8% (I pulled those of Wikipedia, which is hardly a pro commie sources. Feel free to look it up yourself).  \n\nWith today's knowledge hard labour is hardly the best way to deal with criminals. But there was a reason that they, and almost every other nation at the time used them. And that is because the evidence at the time suggested that it was the best way to deal with criminals.\n\nAs for the Katyn Massacre, that was the Nazis not the soviets. (Originally Stalin recommended that they not bother with Poland too by the way, so again, hardly a dictator). The propaganda was designed so that the USSR would struggle to make any alliance between themselves and the poles at all. In fact, Goebbels says in his diary after General Sikorski insisted to endorse this propaganda, leading to a compleate breakdown between the exiled Polish government and the soviets\n\n&gt; \u201cThis break represents a one-hundred-per-cent victory for German propaganda and especially for me personally \u2026 we have been able to convert the Katyn incident into a highly political question.\u201d\n\nWhich alongside the German bullets found in the graves of the incident, can only sugest that this was the doing of Nazis.

Unless social Democrats have some massive victories in the next decade or some World totalitarian government shuts down the internet, I think those two factors will force the issue. Let me put it this way, I think what the 2016 election did for white nationalism ( in terms of making it part of the mainstream dialogue), the Trump Administration and the 2020 election will do for socialism. And as that enormous increase in class consciousness accelerates, the Republican tax plan and basically everything else the Trump Administration does is accelerating the negative tendencies of capitalism so by 2020 we will have a large number of openly socialist candidates running, sparking debate and being part of the national dialogue. Not suggesting those reformist tactics can achieve socialism but just like the Bernie Sanders campaign, it's making a big educational impact.\n\nNoam Chomsky is fond of saying the Republican party is the most dangerous entity in human history. I think that one of the glimmers of class consciousness we see among liberals now is frustration at the contradiction of how our wonderful, liberal democracy is responsible for so much destruction.

{"author":"AlienatedLabor","body":"&gt; This debate [on \"Chinese imperialism\" in Africa] has been in the main superficial, without reference to the dynamic changes in the modes of expansion of capitalism in the period of financialization. It was earlier noted that Lenin wrote that in the imperialist stage one of the distinguishing features of capitalism is that there is the export of capital. Yet it would be simplistic to argue that China is imperialist because there are large-scale Chinese investments in Africa. In reality, the levels of Chinese investments in Africa lag behind the volume of Chinese investments in Europe, North America, or in Eastern Europe. Moreover, the emphasis of many of these criticisms is on investments by Chinese *state* companies, while the much larger, and more clearly exploitative, role of Western multinational corporations is rendered invisible in this accounting due to their *private* nature. Ironically, questions of Chinese imperialism in Africa have been coming primarily from the West and not from Africa, where Chinese involvement and quite different ways of doing business are generally viewed as a counterpoint to the collective imperialism of the triad.\n\nhttps:\/\/monthlyreview.org\/2015\/07\/01\/imperialism-and-anti-imperialism-in-africa\/\n\nSee also:  \nhttps:\/\/af.reuters.com\/article\/africaTech\/idAFKCN1H80YZ-OZATP  \nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ajitbirsingh\/status\/980840321201459201\n\nI would also recommend reading Kwame Nkrumah's *Neo-Colonialism: the Last Stage of Imperialism*.","created_utc":1523514872,"score":23,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"amerikkkan_alien","body":"It depends who you ask. Many maoist won't say that China is imperialist (some will though) but what they will say is that China's actions in Africa could be considered a form of social-imperialism which is a form of lessor  imperialism that is practiced by communist countries that become revisionist such as USSR after Stalin. I personally would be hesitant to label China imperialist though, but I'm giving you a perspective I haven't seen in this thread yet. I agree with you that a lot of the actions don't benefit Africa and are certainly questionable. I think that is the biggest problems a lot of first-world communists have. They aren't willing to criticize and identify social-imperialism, many don't even agree that is a term that should be used in the first place. I don't think we should let our ideology cloud our criticisms. Mao is the one who told us to criticize even communist countries that engage in such a way that could be construed as imperialism, he is the one who called USSR a social imperialist country post-Stalin. Mao was also the one who purged Deng (his successor) during the Cultural Revolution, Deng and his government was  revisionist government.  Many say Xi is on the right path though, the waters become a little murky. I don't think we should call China an imperialist country because that puts them in the same category as Amerikkka which they certainly are not. I appreciate the question, as it brings important much-needed discussion to the sub. I believe specifically the diamond mining going on in Africa is something harmful and possibly exploitative China is doing. Hope my response clarified\/helped.

If Duterte wants guns, he will find a trading partner that will give him guns, whether it be China, America, Russia, or whoever. So China is in the position of either making trade with the Filipino government,  or allowing American capitalists to establish another market. \n\nWhat is America to do otherwise? This is, after all, a two sided. If China trades with Duterte, is America going to back the NPA? Probably not. But if China backed the NPA, would America trade with Duterte? Yes, not only trade, but as we've seen with America, put troops in the Philippines, drop bombs, use gas, etc. \n\nHow many Chinese soldiers have killed NPA members? How many American soldiers would be happy to given the chance? \n\nIs China *forced* into selling Duterte weapons? No, but if I were a Chinese trade minister, I can't say I would make a different decision, given the overall consequences. \n\nEdit I also do not believe these weapons are going to make or break the NPA. How many weapons have they seized from the Filipino military? The NPA is strong, and they will continue to be strong as long as America is not allowed to invade, or establish another DMZ. The NPA has the support from the people, and that is all you need to win a revolution. No matter who is supporting the other side.

Donald Trump's rise to power is such a huge indictment of the American political system, a lot of us had to take a big step back and realize we do not know anything about American political reality. And the truth is, our entire political economic system is a disgrace. An increasingly large number of the left is learning that truth and moving further left.\n\n&gt;The first world benefits from all oppression of the third world\n\nBut oppression of minorities and the working class in the first world itself has become necessary for the profit growth that capitalists now demand. So while the West as an entity is thriving, the bounty is now so uneven in distribution, many Americans experience increasingly not first world living standards.

Basically, your average American is increasingly no longer getting a first World experience.\n\n&gt;I believe the system is also close to breaking down that is why it is starting to turn towards fascism.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n&gt;As people have no problem in Amerikkka with brown muslim kids being bombed and killed by US troops, much less african americans in their own country being brutally murdered by the police.\n\nThese are the contradictions that are increasingly difficult to ignore.

If Chinese SOEs want to meet planned production targets, they need mineral resources that aren't found within the borders of China. In return, the PRC approaches African nations in the spirit of South-South cooperation and asks: \"what can we do for you? we have trained technical personnel who can share their knowledge, we have technology patents, we can build waterways, revamp your plumbing systems, build motorways, refineries, irrigation systems, schools, roads, and hospitals - so tell us, what do you want out of this deal?\"\n\nThis doesn't even compare to the Western approach, which is to approach African nations with a racial-colonial mentality, assert direct military control, enslave their people, wipe out their language and culture, massacre them when they don't comply, brutally put down independence movements, and then once this is no longer economically feasible, to keep them in debt-servitude, control them with financial instruments, and coup their governments when they try to look out for themselves.\n\nIt's totally incomparable and moreover insensitive to the hundreds of millions of people who have lived and died under colonialism and neocolonialism. \n\n&gt;Why can't African countries simply function as their own nation? With complete control and self-determination over there own resources and then trading with China rather than having their resources directly extracted (like Cuba and Sankara's Burkina Faso)? \n\nThis is an admirable position. The question I would pose to you in turn would be: why do you think that this will not be the inevitable outcome of the PRC's increasingly close relationships to many African nations?\n\nWang Yi, China's Foreign Minister [attempted to make the following very clear:](http:\/\/www.china.org.cn\/world\/2018-01\/15\/content_50225798.htm)\n\n* China's financing is in response to Africa's demands for self-development. \n\n * Wang Yi: \"*A country would have a huge need for capital in its primary stage of economic take-off and industrialization and Africa is no exception.*\"\n\n* China has never attached political conditions.\n\n * \"*China also had memories of a bitter past when, with its economic lifeline controlled by foreigners, it was unfairly treated and even exploited and oppressed*.\"\n\n* China has always followed the principle of mutual benefit and win-win results.\n\n * \"*Sino-African cooperation is in essence part of South-South cooperation, and a key characteristic of the latter is that sustained and long-lasting common development can only be achieved through treating each other on an equal footing and ensuring mutual benefit.*\"\n\n * \"*China's financing support for Africa has always gone through a strenuous process of feasibility study with a market-driven approach so that due economic and social effects could be achieved after fulfilling each one of the cooperative projects.*\"\n\n* China is a staunch supporter of African countries' efforts to remedy Africa's debt problem through sustainable development and economic diversification.\n\n* China will continue to do its part in helping Africa enhance its self-development capacity and realize sound economic and social growth.\n\n* China's more general aim is creating a multipolar world -- with multiple power blocs -- the implication being the end of American-European hegemony.\n\nBut suppose you don't take them at their word -- that's also sensible. In that case, we could look at what the PRC is doing already, and how even just the presence of the PRC tips the geopolitical balance.\n\nAfter 1991, the World Bank and the other affiliated cronies of American Empire have subjugated entire countries with unpayable multibillion-dollar loans and forced economic restructurings. Before 1991, the USSR was also capable of acting as a financier who could give out loans (to a lesser extent). This meant that for any independent, non-aligned country, there were multiple options to choose from -- and those different options also coincidentally were sworn enemies of one another. It's easy to see what implications this set-up has for financial independence, and moreover, for interest rates. If the World Bank says, \"we can give you five hundred million dollars at 6% annual interest\", the USSR -- or, for that matter, any other independent bloc with adequate financial resources, could bring up a counter-offer of 800m rubles at 3% annual interest. \n\nChina looms larger in people's heads than it does in reality. This kind of competitive geopolitical situation does not exist yet -- unipolar US imperialism still dominates. But we can already see the cracks in the facade of empire, and soon the US bourgeoisie will realise it is massively overstretching itself.\n\nComplete command over resources and self-determination for African nations is not currently possible. How could it be, with the current structure of imperialism? But with China's help, it is quickly becoming more and more possible.\n\n\n","created_utc":1523565898,"score":11,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"supercooper25","body":"When Marx and Engels talked about spreading the revolution immediately, they were talking in the scope of developed countries with strong military, because those are the countries that Marx predicted would experience socialist revolution first. You might think that Stalin was wrong not to continue the effort of spreading socialism, but after the catastrophes of Tsarism, WWI and the Russian Civil War, the USSR was essentially a third-world country, war-torn, virtually bankrupt, severely underdeveloped and therefore in no good position to start \"spreading\" (aka invading) like Trotsky wanted. Instead, Stalin wanted to consolidate socialism within Russia, industrialize, strengthen the military, raise the living standards, increase food production etc so that they could be in a better position to start spreading the revolution. Unfortunately, these efforts were halted and postponed by the Nazi invasion, but by the start of the 1950's, the Soviets began supporting revolutions all over the world. As a final point, it's also worth mentioning that Russia actually attempted to spread socialism to Germany by supporting the Spartacists (including Rosa Luxemburg), but in order to do this they had to get through Poland, a battle which they unfortunately lost in 1920. In conclusion, I think it's unfair to criticize Stalin for \"socialism in one country\", and you can't really deny that the USSR did in fact attempt to spread and support revolution in any way they could.","created_utc":1523621614,"score":17,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"HysniKapo","body":"Engels' quote was, as might be expected, brought up in the 1920s by Trotsky's supporters during the debates over the issue of building socialism in one country. This is Stalin's [reply](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/archive\/stalin\/works\/1926\/11\/01.htm):\n\n&gt;That was written in the forties of the last century, when monopoly capitalism did not yet exist. It is characteristic that there is not even a mention here of Russia; Russia is left out altogether. And that is quite understandable, since at that time Russia with its revolutionary proletariat, Russia as a revolutionary force, did not yet exist and could not have existed.\n\n&gt;Was what is said here, in this quotation, correct in the conditions of pre-monopoly capitalism, in the period when Engels wrote it? Yes, it was correct.\n\n&gt;Is this opinion correct now, in the new conditions, the conditions of monopoly capitalism and proletarian revolution? No, it is no longer correct.\n\n&gt;In the old period, the period of pre-monopoly capitalism, the pre-imperialist period, when the globe had not yet been divided up among financial groups, when the forcible redivision of an already divided world was not yet a matter of life or death for capitalism, when unevenness of economic development was not, and could not be, as sharply marked as it became later, when the contradictions of capitalism had not yet reached that degree of development at which they convert flourishing capitalism into moribund capitalism thus opening up the possibility of the victory of socialism in individual countries\u2014in that old period the formula of Engels was undeniably correct. In the new period, the period of the development of imperialism, when the unevenness of development of the capitalist countries has become the decisive factor in imperialist development, when inevitable conflicts and wars among the imperialists weaken the imperialist front and make it possible for it to be breached in individual countries, when the law of uneven development discovered by Lenin has become the starting point for the theory of the victory of socialism in individual countries\u2014in these conditions the old formula of Engels becomes incorrect and must inevitably be replaced by another formula, one that affirms the possibility of the victory of socialism in one country.\n\n&gt;Lenin\u2019s greatness as the continuer of the work of Marx and Engels consists precisely in the fact that he was never a slave to the letter of Marxism. In his investigations he followed the precept repeatedly uttered by Marx that Marxism is not a dogma, but a guide to action. Lenin knew this and, drawing a strict distinction between the letter and the essence of Marxism, he never regarded Marxism as a dogma but endeavoured to apply Marxism, as a fundamental method, in the new circumstances of capitalist development. Lenin\u2019s greatness consists precisely in the fact that he openly and honestly, without any hesitation, raised the question of the necessity for a new formula about the possibility of the victory of the proletarian revolution in individual countries, undeterred by the fact that the opportunists of all countries would cling to the old formula and try to use the names of Marx and Engels as a screen for their opportunist activity.\n\n&gt;On the other hand, it would be strange to expect of Marx and Engels, geniuses though they were, that they, fifty or sixty years prior to developed monopoly capitalism, should have been able to foresee accurately all the potentialities of the class struggle of the proletariat which have shown themselves in the period of monopoly, imperialist capitalism.\n\n&gt;And this was not the first instance where Lenin, basing himself on the method of Marx, continued the work of Marx and Engels without clinging to the letter of Marxism. I have in mind another and similar instance\u2014namely; the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We know that on this question Marx expressed the opinion, that the dictatorship of the proletariat\u2014as the smashing of the old state apparatus, and the creation of a new one, of a new, proletarian state\u2014is an essential stage in the advance towards socialism in the continental countries making an exception in the case of England and America, since in those countries, Marx said, militarism and bureaucracy were weakly developed, or not developed at all, and, consequently, some other, \u201cpeaceful\u201d path of transition to socialism was possible. . . But while that proposition was correct in the seventies of the last century, it became incorrect after the nineteenth century, in the period of imperialism, when England became no less bureaucratic and no less, if not more, militaristic than any of the countries of the continent. Comrade Lenin therefore says in his pamphlet _The State and Revolution_ that Marx\u2019s reservation as regards the continent is now invalid, since new conditions have arisen which render superfluous the exception made in the case of England.\n\nThis continued to be the CPSU's position on Engels' comments, e.g. a [Soviet biography of Lenin](https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/LeninBiography1983) from 1983 says the following on pages 219-220:\n\n&gt;However, living as they did in the period of pre-monopoly capitalism, Marx and Engels neither raised nor could raise the question of the possibility of socialism being triumphant in one country.\n\n&gt;One of Lenin's greatest services was that in creatively developing the teachings of Marx and Engels in the new historical conditions, in the epoch of imperialism and proletarian revolutions, he came to the key conclusion that socialism can be victorious first in several countries, or even in one country that does not necessarily have to be at a high level of economic development. He drew this conclusion on the basis of the law, discovered by him, of the uneven economic and political development of capitalism in the imperialist era; this development inevitably leads to the uneven maturing of the socialist revolution in different countries. Lenin first formulated this conclusion in August 1915 in the article \u201cOn the Slogan of a United States of Europe\u201d. \n\n&gt;\u201cUneven economic and political development,\u201d he wrote in this article, \"is an absolute law of capitalism. Hence, the victory of socialism is possible first in several or even in one capitalist country alone. After expropriating the capitalists and organising their own socialist production, the victorious proletariat of that country will arise _against_ the rest of the world - the capitalist world - attracting to its cause the oppressed classes of other countries.\u201d\n\n&gt;From these propositions of Lenin\u2019s it can be seen that by 1915 he already had a clear view of the coming division of the world- into two opposing systems: socialism and capitalism. \n\n&gt;In September 1916, in the article \u201cThe Military Programme of the Proletarian Revolution\u201d, he amplified his views on the prospects for socialist revolution in the imperialist era and on the conditions for its victory. \n\n&gt;\u201cThe development of capitalism proceeds extremely unevenly in different countries. It cannot be otherwise under commodity production. From this it follows irrefutably that socialism cannot achieve victory simultaneously _in all_ countries. It will achieve victory first in one or several countries, while the others will for some time remain bourgeois or pre-bourgeois.\u201d\n\n&gt;Lenin also pointed out that the victorious proletariat must be ready to repulse the military attacks of world imperialism on the socialist state. In such cases.\u201d he wrote, \u201ca war on our part would be a legitimate and just war.\u201d\n\n&gt;Lenin\u2019s theory that socialism can be victorious first in one country or several countries is a model of creative development of revolutionary Marxism and was the greatest discovery of Marxist science. \n\n&gt;He exposed the anti-Marxist substance of Trotsky\u2019s views that socialist revolution cannot be victorious first in one country and criticised Pyatakov, who defined the socialist revolution as the \u201cunited action of the proletarians _of all_ countries\u201d.","created_utc":1523625918,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"HysniKapo","body":"As an addendum, since you also touched on the subject of permanent revolution, here is the entry on that term in the _Great Soviet Encyclopedia_ (aka the USSR's encyclopedia) back in the 70s:\n\n&gt;The idea of permanent, or uninterrupted, revolution was advanced by Marx and Engels in the Communist Manifesto (1848) and in the \u201cAddress of the Central Committee to the Communist League\u201d (1850). The founders of Marxism asserted that if the proletariat had sufficient strength, influence, organization, and an independent political position, it could make the transition from the bourgeois democratic revolution to the socialist revolution and the establishment of proletarian power. \u201cWhile the democratic petit bourgeois wish to bring the revolution to a conclusion as quickly as possible, \u2026 it is our interest and our task to make the revolution permanent, until all more or less possessing classes have been forced out of their position of dominance, until the proletariat has conquered state power\u201d. By \u201cpermanence\u201d Marx and Engels meant a regular succession of stages in the revolutionary process. They warned that \u201cat the beginning of the movement, the workers cannot yet propose any directly communistic measures.\u201d Furthermore, the workers \u201care not able to achieve their own class interests without going completely through a lengthy revolutionary development\u201d.\n\n&gt;Under the new historical conditions of the age of imperialism, Lenin developed the idea of uninterrupted revolution into the theory of the transformation of the democratic revolution into a socialist revolution. \u201cFrom the democratic revolution,\u201d Lenin wrote, \u201cwe shall at once, and precisely in accordance with the measure of our strength, the strength of the class-conscious and organized proletariat, begin to pass over to the socialist revolution. We stand for uninterrupted revolution. We shall not stop half-way\u201d.\n\n&gt;Lenin rejected the outline proposed by the opportunist leaders of the Second International and the Russian Mensheviks, according to which the victory of the bourgeois revolution is inevitably followed by a more or less prolonged period of capitalist development. In the epoch of imperialism, when the world capitalist system is ripe for a socialist revolution, revolutionary democratic transformations constitute an objective threat to capitalism. Monopoly capitalism unites with the most reactionary forces on a platform of hostility toward all revolutions. For precisely that reason, Lenin emphasized, \u201cwe cannot be revolutionary democrats in the twentieth century and in a capitalist country if we fear to advance toward socialism\u201d.\n\n&gt;The idea of the hegemony of the proletariat is the cornerstone of the Leninist theory of the transformation of the democratic revolution into a socialist revolution. The proletariat acts as the driving force behind the continuous development of the democratic revolution and behind the stage-by-stage transition to the solution of increasingly radical tasks and to the creation of the conditions for a socialist revolution. The result of the victory of a democratic revolution is the establishment of a revolutionary democratic type of power, which serves as an instrument for continuously deepening the democratic revolution and transforming it into a socialist revolution. Based on conditions in Russia at the beginning of the 20th century, Lenin defined the class content of this type of power as a revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry.\n\n&gt;After World War II democratic revolutions in a number of European and Asian countries were transformed into socialist revolutions. In several countries the democratic and socialist transformations were closely interwoven and, in essence, constituted two stages in a single revolutionary process.\n\n&gt;The Marxist-Leninist theory of uninterrupted revolution is important because it discloses the lawlike connection between the socialist revolution and various types of people\u2019s democratic movements and revolutions. Furthermore, it makes it possible to find the proper forms and methods for the transition to the socialist revolution, in conformity with the specific conditions in a particular country.\n\n&gt;Marx\u2019s idea of permanent revolution was given a distorted interpretation in the Trotskyist theory put forward by A. Parvus and L. Trotsky during the Revolution of 1905\u201307. This distorted theory became the Trotskyist platform for the struggle against Leninism. In the Trotskyist theory, the idea of the uninterrupted succession of stages in the revolutionary process was replaced with a subjectivist conception that arbitrarily confused all the stages and ignored the logical connection between them. The bourgeois democratic character of the revolution is denied in this theory, and the adventuristic idea of an immediate transition to the socialist revolution is advanced. Trotsky\u2019s position, which disregarded the idea of the revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry, was summarized in the slogan \u201cNo tsar, but a workers\u2019 government.\u201d\n\n&gt;Exposing the eclecticism of the Trotskyist theory, Lenin observed: \u201cFrom the Bolsheviks, Trotsky\u2019s original theory has borrowed their call for a decisive proletarian revolutionary struggle and for the conquest of political power by the proletariat, while from the Mensheviks it has borrowed \u2018repudiation\u2019 of the peasantry\u2019s role\u201d. By rejecting the Marxist-Leninist strategy of class alliances of the proletariat with the peasantry and other nonproletarian strata of the toiling people, the Trotskyist theory essentially closed the path to the formation of the mass political army of the socialist revolution. It undermined internal developmental factors, as well as the possibility of victory for the socialist revolution. In Trotsky\u2019s theory the permanence of the revolutionary process and the fate of the socialist revolution in each country were made to depend on external factors, on the victory of the world revolution. On the basis of these mechanistic views, the Trotskyists came out against the Leninist theory that socialism could be victorious first in a single country. This led them to adopt an orientation contrary to Marxism\u2014the idea of \u201cexporting,\u201d or artificially instigating, revolution.\n\nStalin likewise argued that the CPSU(B) was carrying forward the doctrine of permanent revolution as Marx, Engels and Lenin understood it.

Glyphosate replaced a slew of compounds like cyanazine, EPTC, alachlor, etc. Here are some reasons it is better for the environment:\n\n* Using it as a post-emergence herbicide in conjunction with glyphosate-tolerant crops means farmers can use no-till methods to dramatically reduce carbon emissions\n* Glyphosate has a relatively short half-life, so it breaks down quickly\n* Glyphosate strongly binds plant tissue and soil, so it doesn't readily leach into aquifers\n* It has very low off-target toxicity, so farmers are exposed to fewer toxic agrochems and critters from worms to insects to fish to birds are at lower risk\n* It has high efficiency, so a lower dose is used and less frequently\n\nHere are some sources; I'm happy to provide more links if you have specific questions.\n\n[When used according to revised label directions, glyphosate products are not expected to pose risks of concern to the environment.](http:\/\/www.hc-sc.gc.ca\/cps-spc\/pubs\/pest\/_decisions\/rvd2017-01\/index-eng.php)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[The compound is so strongly attracted to the soil that little is expected to leach from the applied area. Microbes are primarily responsible for the breakdown of the product. The time it takes for half of the product to break down ranges from 1 to 174 days. Because glyphosate is so tightly bound to the soil, little is transferred by rain or irrigation water. One estimate showed less than two percent of the applied chemical lost to runoff ](http:\/\/pmep.cce.cornell.edu\/profiles\/extoxnet\/dienochlor-glyphosate\/glyphosate-ext.html)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Glyphosate use has increased and total pounds of herbicides are up a little or down a little depending on what data is cited. But the real story is that the most toxic herbicides have fallen by the wayside.](https:\/\/geneticliteracyproject.org\/2016\/11\/03\/gmos-food-pesticides-101-no-chemical-flood-yields-rising\/)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[Almost any way you look at the data, it appears that GM crops are no greater contributor to the evolution of superweeds than other uses of herbicides. Which makes sense, because GM crops don\u2019t select for herbicide resistant weeds; herbicides do. Herbicide resistant weed development is not a GMO problem, it is a herbicide problem.](http:\/\/weedcontrolfreaks.com\/2013\/05\/superweed\/)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n[After almost forty years of commercial use, and multiple regulatory approvals including toxicology evaluations, literature reviews, and numerous human health risk assessments, the clear and consistent conclusions are that glyphosate is of low toxicological concern, and no concerns exist with respect to glyphosate use and cancer in humans.](http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.3109\/10408444.2014.1003423)","created_utc":1523644032,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Sir_Doobenheim","body":"Communism has never even been achieved. Where on Earth and when in history has a classless and moneyless society existed? Most questions like these stem from ignorance and serve only as an exercise in dismissal. You have no intention of actually learning or listening. Neither does anyone like you. I think what I find most disingenuous about people that ask questions in this manner is that they truly believe that socialism is flawed and useless without any knowledge of its basic tenets. Or they write it off as a \"nice idea\" but ultimately unachievable. I think it's hypocritical in a way. A common argument from these same people is \"socialists are actually lazy and don't want to work\". Yet they somehow fail to realize that their ignorance of socialism is precisely caused by their own laziness to even read about the basics. You can not argue against something you know nothing about. But, again, it's an exercise in dismissal. Not a sincere engagement of ideas. A means to stroke your own ego and justify your own laziness.","created_utc":1523668743,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"hollabernardo","body":"I will give it a try. The film is full of symbolism\/references so there are definitely a plenty of ways to interpret it. Two of the most prevailing opinions about this film is either to remind the Chinese and the CCP to not repeat the same mistakes as the USSR did, or to simply urge the public to not forget the how we started. The former view can be seen as very pro communism and socialism, the latter view is quite neutral. You need to know something about the Soviet history to be able to fully understand this film.   \n\nMy interpretation + others:\nThe girl represents the working class and is building \"socialism\" through \"blocks\". Each floor of this building is occupied by some of important Soviet figures like Lenin and with her on the top which shows how important the creation of the USSR was to the Chinese people and the CCP. (Marxism Leninism is the foundation of the building). The girl's mother represents the late Soviet Bureaucrats who don\u2019t really care about the socialist development in the USSR and  embrace the American culture to a point that the girl is not allowed to say any bad things about America in the elevator. When she enters the living room, finds her mother is talking bout how effective the American shampoo is, and see the TV showing Lenin's status is being toured down in the USSR and Gorbachev giving a resignation speech, she realizes those people (bureaucrats and elites) have betrayed \"us\". In the end, the early Soviet comrades give a word to the girl \"\u0412\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434, \u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0449\u0438\" which literally means \"Forward Comrades\" in Russian.","created_utc":1523670701,"score":11,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"Let me link two things that will help you:\n\nhttps:\/\/monthlyreview.org\/2012\/07\/01\/the-gdp-illusion\/\nhttp:\/\/www.anwarshaikhecon.org\/sortable\/images\/docs\/publications\/international_trade\/1999\/4-Levyxrus.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi5raeElLraAhUJBHwKHSoOChMQFjAAegQICBAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw0-fTgwXERZkJkCTbywg6Hf\n\n&gt;the terms of trade are determined by the international equalization of profit rates, and that they will generally follow the evolution of real unit labor costs over time. But precisely because of this, they cannot also serve to balance trade among nations -- at least, not unless the real unit labor costs (i.e. real wages and productivities) which underly them were to themselves make the required adjustments. But no such automatic mechanism exists. The upshot of the preceding discussion is that a structurally determined terms of trade will tend to result in structural trade imbalances,  even though demand and real exchange rate movements may produce substantial variations in the short run. \n\n&gt;A  further implication of the structural determination of terms of trade is that the devaluation of a currency will not have a lasting effect unless it indirectly affects real unit labor costs. Insofar as prices take time to adapt to a devaluation, the initial effect might well be to lower a country\u2019s international terms of trade (its real exchange rate) and hence improve its balance of trade. But unless the resulting rise in import prices were to always reduce the real wage to the point of trade balance (which would at the very least require that workers were totally unable to defend any particular standard of living) the long run terms of trade would be still be \u2018wrong\u2019 and a structural trade balance would reappear.\n\n...\n\n&gt;Determinate terms of trade and given national output paths are consistent with persistent structural trade imbalances. Suppose a country has a trade deficit. It may also have particular net long term capital flows (in or out) arising from the equalization of rates of return, corresponding flows of wages, profits and dividends, and various other exogenous items. If these flows cover the trade deficit, then the balance of payments will be zero and the nominal exchange rate will be stable. If they overfill or underfill  the gap in the balance of payments left by the trade deficit, then there exists endogenous mechanisms which will bring the balance of payments back into line. The mechanism in question arises from the effect of balance of payments surpluses or deficits on domestic liquidity. For instance, an ongoing balance of payments deficit implies a net outflow of funds from the country, which will lower liquidity and hence tend to raise interest rates and rates of return on financial assets (Harrod, 1933, p. ones16. 53)\u201c.  The raised rates of return will in turn attract short term international capital inflows to fill the balance of payments gap, which will also raise liquidity and drive domestic (risk-adjusted) rates of return back down towards equality with foreign ones.\n\nHere's the summary:\n\n&gt;Absolute advantage theory implies that trade imbalances will tend to persist, because they reflect structural inequalities in the real production costs of nations. It implies that devaluations will not have a lasting effect on trade balances, unless they are also attended by fundamental changes in these very same costs (i.e. in national real wages and productivities). If not, trade imbalances will provoke counterbalancing international capital flows, with a concomitant build-up of international debt burdens.\n\nAnd yes, it's very hard to connect Marx's abstract formulations to the real economy because the real economy is so warped.

Personally I, being a westerner and a materialist find very useful hellenic philosophy, that of stoics and epicureans. I bumped into them by reading Foucault courses at the academie francaise. He mentioned a Pierre Hadot, a philosophy historian, who re-interpreted stoics and epicureans not as scholarly texts, but as practical philosophies. Notoriously influenced by eastern thought, through Alexander conquests, but had to deal with an everyday life under the roman empire (not so different form the american one I guess).

Secondly, most communists acknowledge that Assad is not our comrade, but we support him because he's against NATO imperialism, hence why there are Marxist guerrillas fighting alongside the Syrian army. Assad is a democratically elected leader with overwhelming approval among the Syrian people, and NATO has a track record of replacing democratically elected leaders with oppressive dictatorships. Thirdly, in regards to Russia, I don't think many people on here actually like Putin. He is indeed bourgeois and imperialist, but in the context of the situation in Syria we support him against NATO aggression. Russia may be after Syria's oil, but that's still a lot better than the overthrow of their government. My final point is, as has already been mentioned, Russia was invited into Syria, similarly to how the USSR was invited in by Afghanistan.

Even if you don't like Stalin and you wanna go the anti-ussr route, there have still been communists  (even in America and Europe) that fought for and irrefutably succeeded in improving the lives of the proletariat class-- first as revolutionaries whose demands led to reformation from pressure and dissent by the masses in opposition to the state. (The BPP comes to mind, as does the IWW)\n\nYou judge communism by the least attractive doings (however misinformed) of socialist countries and use that as a basis to model the entire perception of communism rather than meeting the fact that so many more communist movements, leaders, and countries have existed and improved the lives of the people that lived there drastically. At least us commies admit the good that came from the epoch of capitalism before we put forth a way to further human civilization by stepping away from unethical class antagonisms and various productive contradictions that make Capitalism such an unstable system. \n\nThe only thing that saying \"communism kills millions of people\" does is just shut down conversation of alternatives to capitalism (which has killed many more people than communism has, even by using the most grotesque \"\"\"statistical\"\"\" figures available in opposition to communism).\n\n It's a way of dismissing researching *any* alternative to the status quo in a passive (or actively boot-licking) \"roll-over-and-accept-defeat\" character. \n\nYou speak of how communism killed millions, but you don't mention how many lives were saved by social institutions put forth by those very communist countries, and as such don't even bother weighing the opportunity cost of revolution vs no-revolution in those countries. \n\nI swear if people like you held capitalism to even slightly similar standards you hold communism, you'd be comrades in a minute flat.","created_utc":1523880586,"score":9,"subreddit":"communism"}

I may not like capitalism, but I'd be extremely foolish to say that \"it doesn't work\" even if I think it is inherently self destructive.\n\nFull Communism may seem utopian because it's favorable and difficult to achieve, but that doesn't mean it's impossible. If you told a person 2000 years ago that one day machines will do the work they're doing, or even explained what kinds of machines we have now, they'd say it's utopian, not going to happen, etc., because it's out of the realm of possibility for that particular epoch in human society for a plethora of reasons. If you read texts from slave owners and apologists, they say that a society without chattel slaves is utopian and such is the natural order of things. If you read texts from kings, they assert that monarchy is the natural order of things and the only way to establish true order. The theory and praxis of marxist socialism serves the purpose of paving a way for communism; you're right in that full communism is utopian if we try to establish it right now. \n\nThis doesn't mean that it will always be impossible, and that's why we have socialism. \n\n&gt; extreme mental slavery\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by this. \n\n&gt; no individuality \n\nYes there is. People are still people. If your individuality is expressed in commodity markets and in private property, then you must have a different definition of individuality than me. Art, music, etc. continue to exist, stories and poetry continue to exist, and with no incentive to achieve the most surplus labor time for the sake of a capitalist, you can instead spend that time outside of work following those passions. \n\n&gt; shitty practices\n\nTo chalk the socialist countries' issues simply up to the existence of socialism in the country is a very naive approach to the history of these countries. They had so many more outside factors effecting what was happening in their country (primarily the existence of world superpowers seeking to invade, geographical conditions such as droughts, poor practices of previous governments they had to fix, etc. ) that it would be extremely reductionist to chalk these failures up to socialism in of itself, or even in their application of socialism in the country. \n\nAs a side note, which I like to ask anyone that criticizes marxist theory from a rightist perspective, what have you read by notable marxist writers that leads you to believe their analysis and proposed solutions are utopian? If you go so far as to disregard the entire system, you have to have some theoretical criticisms of Marx and friends' works. If not and you are going solely by pragmatism of history, then surely outside forces invading, sabotaging, couping,  etc. any socialist society that pops up would taint this approach to analyzing its effectiveness in the real world.

It's not true and even if it was it would have no influence on whether the ltv is true.\n\n&gt;So where is the surplus value being created in these cases? That's what I'm confused about, I guess, as it's not as clear to me as in the case of factory workers being exploited.\n\nI'm not sure what's confusing. You simply have to concretely investigate the question to discover the answer. What does Facebook do? It harvests data for advertisers. The form may have changed but the phenomenon has not, Marx covers advertising quite well as unproductive labor. That doesn't mean they aren't proletarian, that question has to be answered by looking at:\n\n&gt;that class of modern wage labourers who, having no means of production of their own, are reduced to selling their labour power in order to live\n\nDo Facebook employees have to sell their labor power in order to live? Some probably do, most do not since their large salary comes from the social surplus. Do they produce surplus value? No, but even if they did it would be far less than the surplus value they gain in wages and benefits. Do they own the means of production? They don't but they could, since they only thing that keeps them going to work and using work computers is intellectual property law, a fetter on capital itself. These are social categories which are in constant flux, the only constant being that the proletariat grows ever larger and the bourgeoisie ever smaller. The growth of the first world tech industry (not actually very many people overall but has intellectual hegemony, particularly among the white men who come to this site) is the growth of a labor aristocracy and management (petty-bourgeoisie) to regulate the vast production sites of the third world which necessarily takes the form of virtual management. Both of these classes, which were the counterpoint to the much larger growth of the proletariat under neoliberalism, itself are disappearing into the proletariat (this is why they have hegemony since they represent the fantasy of escape from proletarianization that first world petty-bourgeois cling to). Facebook has aspects of that but it's really a giant advertising company that is hugely overvalued because it financial speculation which filters into the wages of its employees. Instead of asking whether the \"tech\" industry (a term with no meaning since capitalism has always been about \"tech\"), concretely investigate what's going on in certain sectors and in certain companies. Only then do the general mechanics of where these large wages actually come from become clear, I've only done the most rudimentary job.","created_utc":1523983612,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

So capitalism as been technically a plutocracy for most of its existence. Why was that? On one side the ruling classes discovered the power of propaganda during the first world war, on the other, after the second, pretty much all was in ruin, and free market capitalism was held to be the responsible (that in the US too). Workers where needed to rebuild and the communist menace, after the Russian revolution, was a big problem. So the ruling classes compromised. Capital was placed under strict national control. Industry was nationalised and put under partial democratic control. Workers gained more and more rights. But most of all, capital was taxed. In the us progressive taxation got to a maximum of past 90% taxation after a certain profit. Unfortunately after the golden ages of social democracy, private capital realised that it was once again under treat (read power memo or trilateral commission report on the problem of democracy ... which was that there was too much of it). Private power grew by the 80s to have enough power to launch - with Tatcher and Reagan - a sort of counter reformation. Reformation that is best described by the points of the Washington consensus; dismantling of the social state; privatisation; deregulation of finance; dismantlement of workers rights etc. \n\nSo you see, you need to reason with all of those who do not know their past, historically. Communism and capitalism are historical, if you learn about the historical development of the relation of power between private capital and wage labour, counterarguments will be automatic. Eric Hobsbawm account is a good place to start. \n\n","created_utc":1523997039,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"LeoPenetrozza","body":"You think people earn the same amount even across different fields and positions under communism? Looks like someone doesn't understand basic economics. \n\n\nLet me TRY to explain it to you. The individual producer receives back from society -- after the deductions have been made -- exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labor. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; the individual labor time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share in it. He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labor (after deducting his labor for the common funds); and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost. The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.\n\nHere, obviously, the same principle prevails as that which regulates the exchange of commodities, as far as this is exchange of equal values. Content and form are changed, because under the altered circumstances no one can give anything except his labor, and because, on the other hand, nothing can pass to the ownership of individuals, except individual means of consumption. But as far as the distribution of the latter among the individual producers is concerned, the same principle prevails as in the exchange of commodity equivalents: a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form.\n\nHence, equal right here is still in principle -- bourgeois right, although principle and practice are no longer at loggerheads, while the exchange of equivalents in commodity exchange exists only on the average and not in the individual case.\n\nIn spite of this advance, this equal right is still constantly stigmatized by a bourgeois limitation. The right of the producers is proportional to the labor they supply; the equality consists in the fact that measurement is made with an equal standard, labor.\n\nBut one man is superior to another physically, or mentally, and supplies more labor in the same time, or can labor for a longer time; and labor, to serve as a measure, must be defined by its duration or intensity, otherwise it ceases to be a standard of measurement. This equal right is an unequal right for unequal labor. It recognizes no class differences, because everyone is only a worker like everyone else; but it tacitly recognizes unequal individual endowment, and thus productive capacity, as a natural privilege. It is, therefore, a right of inequality, in its content, like every right.\n\n\nYour claims are also bullshit, every socialist\/ communist country had plenty of doctors and teachers. Hell, Cuba is the epitome of medicine in modern society in terms of amount, efficiency, reception and structure. Ever heard of the Escuela Latinoamericana de Medicina? It beats the pathetic joke of a profit-driven \"healthcare\" americans get. ","created_utc":1524004575,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

It has become increasingly difficult forAmericans to climb the economic ladder, but this isn't new at all. \n\nThe U.S. has one of the highest levels of income inequality among its peers and is among the worst in offering equal opportunities\u00a0for advancement. Whether an American gets ahead is also more dependent on the income and education of their parents. This have been statistical truths for decades in both America and the rest of the world. Why do you thibk Income inequality and economic mobility have already emerged as\u00a0hot topics for the 2016 presidential election, with candidates on both sides of the aisle offering their prescriptions for \"solving\" the growing income gap? Income inequality in America is not just the result of market forces, but also\u00a0politics and policies put in place by lawmakers and companies, particularly after Ronald Reagan's election in 1980, which were at the same time pushed by capitalist economic interests.\n\nThe post-World War II era was prosperous for both the American economy and its workers. But since then wages have stagnated, with\u00a0median income falling to where it was 40 years ago. Meanwhile, CEO pay has risen to 300 times the average worker's income, up from 30 times. Minimun wage\u00a0jobs are increasingly held by a family's primary breadwinner, instead of a teen looking for part-time work.\n\nThere's no way to beat that under capitalism\n One way to combat it ks to lessen the monopolist\u00a0power of companies and their grip on control over the political system giving that power to workers instead, like Unions, which leads to lower wages for CEOs and higher ones for workers. But hey, that's breaking the rules, isn't it? It's touching the profit of someone else. \n\nThe circulation of money between consumers and producers isn't safe from capitalism either - profit-seeking drives employers to give lower worker wages, which impedes them to keep buying products, which leads to a halt in that circulation.Remember the big recession? Yeah, that was also driven by profit. \n\nEven such a common myth as the american dream is filled with inconsistency and contradiction - a sample of what capitalism is, and makes. \n\n","created_utc":1524005692,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Why is it that the same religion gets interpreted in radically different ways in different societies, at different times in history? A Marxist would say that ultimately a myriad of different material conditions determine what ideas become the dominant ones within a certain group, in a certain society, at a certain time.

Because social science studies people, and people are so complex in their behaviors and psychology, there\u2019s always an exception. There are always outliers and anomalies. Correlation vs. causation is a staple concept of sociology since almost anything we do will be examining statistics.\n\n&gt;This is why we study trends. The best we can really do is get a hypothesis to a point where we have some empirical evidence to support something like x + y usually = z (but not always), and that gives us something to go on. But still, because of human nature, we will never get to a direct plug-and-play formula to tell us exactly what is detrimental to every single case and what isn\u2019t.\n\n&gt;Some (mostly older) scientists kind of frown on the lack of precision in these so-called \u201csoft\u201d sciences, but I find it extra challenging and extra fascinating.

{"author":"amerikkkan_alien","body":"I\u2019m a muslim communist living in Amerikkka. I believe the islamaphobia and oppression against muslims creates class consciousness and anti-imperialist tendencies. I became a communist at the age of 13 due to my religious identity being so politicized in Amerikkka. My family, religious muslims, although not communist basically have all the ideals communists do aside from the political knowledge of marxism. I was taught to put poor people over myself, to care for everybody (not only to condemn but actively fight all forms of oppression as the Prophet said), and to treat the earth with respect. I reject all reactionary beliefs in my religion but I also realize most of these reactionary beliefs were created because of western imperialism in the middle east. I also reject any reactionary beliefs that don\u2019t stem from imperialism although most do. For example the first university in the world was created by a Muslim Women, science, astrology, algebra were all advanced and even created by Muslims. Yet even westerners see Islam as something that is against women\u2019s education or even education in general. Meanwhile the universities they go to were first created by a muslim woman in 802 while in the western world women were not allowed university until 1800\u2019s. Our religion has been destroyed and corrupted through imperialism. I must stress the fact that I reject all reactionary\/structural beliefs. I also stay muslim because I hate western supremacy and Europeans thought (besides communism\/marxism which isn\u2019t European in nature) I wouldn\u2019t even be muslim if my  identity was suppressed\/oppressed. My people are being genocided in Kashmir, Myanmar, Palestine, Syria and the entire middle east. Under a hypothetical situation where full communism is achieved I would probably not be muslim or at least not display and identify as it. I couldn\u2019t understand too well how someone could be hindu, buddhist or christian communists although they are. But they would have different explanation since their religious-identity isn\u2019t suppressed. Islam is deeply tied to the race of brown people and culture as well; it can\u2019t simply be erased from existence (hence the \u201cIslamic socialism\u201d that emerged last century). Not at least till all oppression against it is eliminated can Islam be detached from the middle east\/south asia. The amount of times I\u2019ve been called Osama, terrorist, sadam, \u201csandnigger\u201d is unfathomable. Since an early age I was bullied and treated like an enemy. For a while I allowed people to bully me, I was a victim. Then I started to fight and become militant; I beat the fuck out of racists physically. I called myself \u201cradical.\u201d Now many white people call themselves radical, but for a muslim to call themselves radical is extremely different due to the oppression we face. I was seen as an actual villain; a terrorist to many. I was seen as a threat and a Menace To Society. I\u2019m sure many around me see me this way. Being a muslim is already dangerous in Amerikkka but being an outspoken-unapologetically radical muslim communist artist is a whole other thing. I don\u2019t have a privledge to hide my identity, religion (it\u2019s in my name and race), nor my communist beliefs. My aunt was physically assaulted for wearing a hijab (obviously of her own will another subject of racism western liberals and sometimes even communists say with racial undertones). Marx was speaking as a European white man during the 1800\u2019s and although I agree with his conclusions on organized religion; it is time our perspective becomes a little more nuanced especially when dealing with Islam\/Islamaphobia &amp; identity.

{"author":"Bradm77","body":"I'm a Christian.  Right before he calls religion the opium of the people he says \"Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering.\"  Roland Boer points out that there is an ambivalence here ... religion can both cause people to accept the horrible conditions they are in and it can cause them to protest those conditions.  I try to remember Marx's passage here because there is truth in the idea that all too often religion pacifies us to the suffering around us.  I think this is very important for religious leftists to always keep in the back of their minds - that throughout history religion has been used to back powerful rulers, to justify slavery, to deny people of basic rights, etc.  But with that in mind, I try to focus on the other way that Marx say religion can function - religion as protest against the suffering around us.   \n\nI'd also like to point out that often \"opium of the people\" brings to mind religion being something that pacifies the oppressed masses from rising up against those who exploit them.  But religion is also a tool of the ruling class - it functions to help relieve their guilt for being oppressors.  For example, a wealthy person could think to himself \"I'm a good person, I go to church every Sunday, I give money to charity, I am kind to people, and where I do fall short I am forgiven by God\" while at the same time they own a business that exploits people and the environment.  Rulers should feel guilty for starting wars and implementing policies that hurt people but religion can assuage that guilt.  Jesus called leaders like this hypocrites and rebuked them.

It's important to avoid fundamentalism though, because that makes you lose sight of the fact that every spiritual path is just a method to try to live happily, which fundamentalism abstracts with ideas of being \"the one true religion\" and such. \n\nI've gone on quite a tangent, so I'll say that overall they mesh well so long as you don't get so attached to your beliefs (including Buddhism and communism) that you lose sight of the Divine in everything (which means to me, don't be a revolutionary because you hate the rich; be a revolutionary because you love the people)","created_utc":1524075559,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

Or they get attached to life and begin to experience an anxiety of death; or they get attached to a certain opinion and can no longer relate to others that don't share this opinion. This last one is a struggle I'm currently facing, as was my struggle previously with buddhism and having trouble relating to people that didn't share this opinion and deaming myself \"holier than thou\" so to speak. I didn't stop being a Buddhist or practicing my Buddhist rituals or anything, I just stopped letting it have so much control over my perception that I couldn't enjoy company of others' that were different. I find it very difficult to feel happy if my ego gets in the way too much, and communism and buddhism and such are all just aspects of my ego. \n\nI find that the illusion of virtue is good for social relations, and from what I've seen it's very effective at manipulating others in social situations, but from my own experience it's very difficult to feel connected or genuine inside my own mind if I'm simply putting on the appearance of virtue rather than finding virtue's natural place within me. I think this feeling is similar to people that feel sad \"putting on a mask\" to seem happy when inside they're in turmoil \n\nI'm sure other people have a different experience with attachment, which is why I've given two simple examples and then one more particular to myself.

{"author":"ASocialistAbroad","body":"I meant to post this hours ago, but my internet went bad. \n\nYou seem to have a very simplistic and reductionist view of religion. Marx was a historical materialist and was more interested in religion as a human institution than as some static ideology that only comes from a religious text. When you interpret religion as reducible to the \"literal\" interpretation of a religious text, you are not thinking very critically about it. You are not addressing religion as it exists or functions in the real world, nor do you seem to care about the material causes of religious practice and why the same religion manifests itself so differently in different groups of people. \n\nYou also seem to be conflating \"religion\" with \"religious people\". Notice that our conversation didn't start with a criticism of Christianity, but with you saying that you hate Christians. Do you think Marx hated religious people?\n\nI suggest giving this a read.

{"author":"m3talsmith","body":"Let's see if anyone can tell who wrote this:\n\n&gt;Politics must not be subject to the economy, nor should the economy be subject to the dictates of an efficiency-driven paradigm of technocracy. Today, in view of the common good, there is an urgent need for politics and economics to enter into a frank dialogue in the service of life, especially human life. Saving banks at any cost, making the public pay the price, foregoing a firm commitment to reviewing and reforming the entire system, only reaffirms the absolute power of a financial system, a power which has no future and will only give rise to new crises after a slow, costly and only apparent recovery...\n\nThis is in the meat of Laudato Si, past all the niceties and introductions. Along with many other major treatises about overthrowing capitalism, I picked this 173 page one up at my parish a month ago. Anti-Capitalism, while not always the ML form, is getting pumped out continuously from Pope Francis as directives that Catholics must take seriously: his anti-capitalism, building on earlier works from early Christian works, is getting close to dogma. I know there are problems and half measures, and we're not going to see the revolution we really want to see through this lit, but he's trying to root out the conservatives who only seek to gather wealth, screw the poor, etc.\n\nMost people only catch the snippets printed in the news. I would hope anyone trying to critique the role of religion in the apathy of the masses would look beyond the news cycles and study more of what the masses are being told to do from various religious leaders. You'll find bad (mostly from rich capitalist apologists dressed in a pastors collar) and good (mostly from radical martyred anti-capitalist priests).\n\nMeanwhile, I think there's room for mysticism and Marxism, so long as we work with reality and not on some misplaced faith. I certainly don't put faith that these critiques of Pope Francis' will change the status of Capitalism anytime soon, but I have seen them open eyes up to it for the first time. If all they do is help in the awakening of the masses, so be it. There's nothing soft and generalized for the readers of it to take comfort in though: it's act or be revealed as a hypocrite.\n\nKeep learning and march on comrades.","created_utc":1524107170,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

The story of Fenrir's binding can easily be interpreted in a communist light: Fenrir, a gluttonous wolf that would devour everything given the chance, could be used as a stand in for capitalism.\nIn the Cath Maige Tuired the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danan react first with diplomacy, and continue that approach whenever available.

The gods or god of any teaching adapt with time, place, and necessity; the one facet that stays true is that a god often represents the highest truth of a given aspect.  We see countless gods, godesses, and spirits of medicine, hospitality, love, etc.  For each of those there are countless more for natural phenomena.\n\nAt their core many beliefs hold the world around them sacred.

It fails to recognize that the two, although they share similar themes, are very different in application. (It should be also noted that there is a difference between Russian Communism and Chinese Communism) and someone more knowledgeable than me could explain that better).Americans.\nSecondly, Communism does not necessarily mean anti-democratic. Communism is a economic system that also heavily relies upon a certain political process in order to achieve its goals, i is not inherently led by a \u201cstrongman\u201d like fascism is, it just so happens that due to the way violent revolutions occur oft times a \u201cstrongman\u201d will rise to the top. I would argue that in a more pure form of a Communistic society it would be run largely democratically as the will of the workers must be applied, and due to the human nature of disagreement they would need a system to vote upon what they desire to work towards.\nLastly, a lot of this article seems to neglect the politics of fear, group psychology, the mentality of race\/culture of the time, and that by its very structure capitalism will have to change\/be removed as resources become scarce and automation happens to the work force.\nSo I\u2019m summary, it was an interesting article.

The USSR took great measures to undue the influence that previous imperial organized religion had on society.

I just read yesterday a BBC article that said there are \"criminal penalties\" and your passport(US I assume) could be revoked.  I've often wondered myself as a dual citizen what would it mean if I lost my US passport but kept my Irish one.  I know my Irish consulate reminded me that I still need my US passport to leave and re-enter the US, that's the law, but in all reality no one checks it when you leave, only when you come back.\n\nUN international law mandates a country readmits their own citizen regardless of passport, and people have proven this to be true by re-entering the US at the Mexican border without a passport.  Expect a shit ton of hassle though on the way back in, possibly hours and hours.  But if they specifically revoked your passport and you left and tried to re-enter I'd imagine they'd punish you in some way.  But it's worth noting, you can cross into Mexico at the border as a pedestrian showing no one anything.  So if you ever needed to leave, cross over and use your 2nd passport at the Tijuana Airport or something.  I'm not sure what your 2nd citizenship is and if they would work with the US to cancel your foreign passport.  Personally, I don't like to burn my bridges since I have family in the US.\n\nI would shoot an email off to the North Korean tour companies based in China and ask them the specific penalties for more expert and specific answer, since they deal with it professionally.  I'd also consider looking into a lawyer consultation on dual citizenship, and how any potential penalties apply to your 2nd passport.  If you never plan on returning to the US, I doubt they'd come for you but if you're like me and have family there then you probably don't want to burn the bridge.","created_utc":1524182053,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

It always has been given the island has few natural resources. What exactly do you expect them to trade in? Ricardo's trade theory applies to socialist nations as well. I have a hard time believing you seriously expect us to be angry at the Soviets for subsidizing their economy. Even so, this is 2018, we know what happened when those subsidies were removed. The Cubans and the Koreans don't look back on the 90s with peachy endearment do they comrade?\n\nThe Cubans are doing their best in these dark days. There are more communists on that island than in your entire nation much less that tiny organization. Leave them alone, they have enough shit to deal with, let them chart their own course as best they can.\n\nEdit: I didn't mean to come off super harsh comrade but there's even a video of Castro very frankly stating that if the Soviets wouldn't have helped defend Angola, he would've left the alliance believing it so revisionist as to no longer be worth saving. That's not something an imperialist puppet leader says.","created_utc":1524194935,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

The US benefits greatly from the Syrian Civil War and is establishing bases of control throughout Syria.

{"author":"comrade_eddy","body":"&gt; On the North Korean topic, it was North Korea who invaded South Korea so in return, the US helped its ally, so I'd say what do you expect when you're attacking a nation you know is protected by a superpower.\n\nYour understanding of why and how the war started is steeped in western mythology.  South Korea was led by a US educated dictator who executed 200k citizens without trial because they were alleged leftists sympathizers (some were children).  That dictator, Rhee, lost the election to a leftist but refused to step down.  South Korea had been shallowly invading NK, killing people, and were building up their military preparing for an invasion when NK decided that enough was enough.  Then the US got involved and bombed NK with a brutality that even shocked the rest of the bourgeois world - several countries including the UK condemned US actions.  But please continue justifying the slaughter of civilians.\n\n&gt; So, my message is that the US is a nation that has made horrendous mistakes and is currently continuing to do so, but in the next generation or the one after, I think that the US can turn back from where its going now into a socialist route.\n\nNot mistakes just actions motivated by something other than what you\u2019ve learned from propaganda.  It\u2019s time to grow up, abandon the fairy tales that you believe, and wash that star spangled shit out of your eyes and come to terms with the fact that the US is a monster and the biggest barrier to liberation and freedom around the world.

By calling liberation theology reactionary you are also, according to Lenin, splitting the movement.\n\nOf course we must critique certain reactionary aspects in social policy (anti-queer notions for example) within strains of liberation theology, but liberation theology is necessarily about *liberation* something some Marxists can't seem to wrap their heads around. \n\nI recommend reading Marxist writings on Munzter and practically anything by Roland Boer for more on the subject of the relationship between Marxism and religion.","created_utc":1524324037,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

This description is due to two major reasons: \n\nThe first is that they are actively attempting to, in their words, \u201cdivide the left\u201d due to differences in what we consider praxis, which basically amounts to them slandering other leftist groups such as the one I am in on social media and starting all sorts of drama amongst the activist community (which honestly does more to alienate people from socialist ideas and push people away from participating in socialist groups than the red scare propaganda that still exists here in the US). They are doing the liberal\u2019s work for them. \n\nThe second reason concerns what they call \u201cpraxis.\u201d Differences concerning what is proper praxis should exist and should be debated over amongst socialists of course (I am not saying my group or myself have the perfect handle on what praxis entails or anything like that). However, their \u201cpraxis\u201d is little more than individualistic and performative actions that are extremely isolated and do not appear to be building towards any macro level goal other than making themselves feel better and venting their frustrations with society in unproductive ways. \n\nWhat they call \u201cpraxis\u201d amounts to little more than first, liberal charity for people who are homeless (which does nothing to address the system that puts people in the position of homelessness in the first place and in fact helps the system by trying to mitigate problems that the capitalist system creates without actively challenging the system), second, they spray anarchist graffiti in public parks and other public areas (because tarnishing public areas that are paid for and maintained primarily by the working class is *totally* in line with creating a society by and for the working class), and third, they go to liberal protests and meetings just to act belligerently and aggressively towards the centrist Democrat types (which totally will get people on the fence about socialism to listen to those ideas *eye roll*). \n\nThey act very aggressively towards liberals when their commitment to individualism, tendency to participate in performative and ultimately ineffectual protests, and their love of charity makes them much more similar to liberals than they would ever care to admit.

The gigantic strength of the single-minded unity of the Party and all the people has served as the driving force and main secret behind the country\u2019s re-emergence as a world-class nuclear power and its presence at the centre of the world political landscape.\n\nNoting that such a historic cause as the national nuclear arms programme has been perfectly accomplished in a matter of less than five years, he described this miraculous achievement as a great victory of the WPK\u2019s simultaneous-push line and also as a brilliant victory that can only be achieved by the heroic Korean people.\n\nHe referred to the economic progress which has been made while the entire Party, whole nation and all the people have been out to carry out the simultaneous-push line.\n\nBright prospects of the self-reliant national economy and the upward trend of the overall economy illustrate the validity and vitality of our Party\u2019s simultaneous-push line, he stated.\n\nChairman Kim Jong Un declared with pride that the historic tasks of the strategic simultaneous-push line set forth in the March 2013 plenary meeting of the Party Central Committee have been brought to brilliant completion.\n\nThe victory of the simultaneous-push line, he said, means the successful conclusion of the efforts of our people who have tightened their belt and endured a host of difficulties to build a powerful treasure sword with which to protect peace, and it also provides a sure guarantee that our future generations can lead the most dignified and happy life in the world.\n\nGiven the scientific and orderly implementation of the whole process of the nuclear arms programme, the scientific development of delivery and strike means and the verified completion of nuclear weaponization, he said, we see no point in conducting any nuclear tests and test launches of intermediate and intercontinental ballistic missiles anymore and, accordingly, the northern nuclear testing ground has accomplished its mission in this regard.\n\nHe outlined the Party\u2019s peace-loving stand, saying that we would make a positive contribution to building a nuke-free world in response to the common desire and demand of mankind, now that we have built up our strength to such a level we want and we have provided a sure guarantee for ensuring the security of our state and people.\n\nWith the successful implementation of the historic tasks of the simultaneous-push line, he noted, our Party is now faced with a crucial revolutionary task of bringing earlier the final victory of the cause of socialism by speeding up the advance of the revolution with confidence in victory.\n\nHe set it as the Party\u2019s strategic line to concentrate Party-wide and nationwide efforts on socialist economic construction, now that the DPRK has emerged as a full-fledged world power in political, ideological and military terms.\n\nWe have the masses of the people endowed with inexhaustible creativity, an army of scientists and technicians trained by the Party, and the foundation of the self-reliant economy immune to any upheavals, he said, adding that the new strategic line of focusing on economic construction is the most scientific and revolutionary line.\n\nHe pointed to the need to launch a general revolutionary offensive, a dynamic campaign for economic construction, holding up such a militant slogan as \u201cLet us further accelerate the advance of our revolution by concentrating all our efforts on socialist economic construction!\u201d\n\nThe immediate targets for the implementation of the new strategic line, he noted, are to put production on track at all industrial establishments and gather rich harvests in every field during the period of the five-year strategy for the development of the national economy, thus bringing delight to the people across the country.\n\nLong-term goals are to make the national economy Juche-oriented, modern, IT-based and scientific at high levels and to bring a satisfactory life, affluent and civilized, to all people, he said.","created_utc":1524361645,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

And he called for redoubling efforts to speed up the victorious advance of the revolution.\n\nSpeeches on the first agenda item were made by Choe Ryong Hae, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau and vice-chairman of the WPK Central Committee, Premier Pak Pong Ju, also member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee, and Kim Jong Gak, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People\u2019s Army.\n\nThey expressed full support and approval for the Chairman\u2019s report on the historic victory that has raised the DPRK to the status of strategic state and the new strategic line of concentrating all efforts on socialist economic construction.\n\nSaying the Party\u2019s new line correctly reflecting the demand of the times and the aspirations of the people will further accelerate the Korean revolution, they pledged themselves to focus on socialist economic construction as intended by the Party to exalt the dignity of the DPRK and its spirit of leap forward.\n\nResolutions were adopted on the first item with unanimous approval.\nResolution \u201cOn proclaiming the great victory of the line of simultaneously pushing economic construction and nuclear arms buildup\u201d specifies the following decisions:\n\nFirst, we solemnly declare that we have realized nuclear weaponization with credit by carrying out subcritical and underground nuclear tests, making nuclear weapons smaller and lighter and developing super-large nuclear weapons and delivery means in order in the course of the campaign for implementing the Party's simultaneous-push line.\n\nSecond, we will discontinue nuclear test and intercontinental ballistic missile test-fire from April 21.\n\nThe northern nuclear testing ground will be dismantled to transparently guarantee the discontinuation of nuclear test.\n\nThird, the discontinuation of nuclear test is an important process for global nuclear disarmament, and the DPRK will join the international community in its aspirations and efforts for the total nuclear test ban.\n\nFourth, the DPRK will never use nuclear weapons unless there is nuclear threat or nuclear provocation against it, and in no cases will it transfer nuclear weapons and technology.\n\nFifth, we will concentrate all efforts on building a powerful socialist economy and radically improving the people's living standards by mobilizing all human and material resources of the country.\n\nSixth, we will create an international environment favourable for socialist economic construction and restart contact and dialogue with neighbouring countries and the international community in order to defend peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and beyond.\n\nResolution \"On concentrating all efforts on socialist economic construction in line with the requirements of a new stage of the developing revolution\" stipulated the following decisions:\n\nFirst, we will orientate overall Party and state work to socialist economic construction and concentrate all efforts on it.\n\nSecond, Party and working people's organizations and government, judicial and military organs shall enhance their roles in the efforts to concentrate all efforts on socialist economic construction.\n\nThird, Party organizations and political organs at all levels shall make a regular control and review of the implementation of the decisions of the Third Plenary Meeting of the Seventh Party Central Committee to ensure the thorough implementation of them.\n\nFourth, the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly and the Cabinet shall take legal, administrative and technical measures to carry out the tasks set forth in the resolutions of the plenary meeting of the Party Central Committee.\n\nThen the meeting discussed the second agenda item.\n\nChairman Kim Jong Un made a report on the item.\n\nHe referred to the need to bring about a revolutionary turn in science and education, saying that the issue of concentrating all efforts on economic construction, which has been discussed as the first item, is unthinkable apart from their rapid development.\n\nScience and education are the foundation of nation building and a major index to national strength, he said, adding that great sci-tech force and high educational standard make it possible to build a powerful state and maintain independence as well.\n\nNoting that to develop science and education is an undertaking to carry on the lifeline of the revolution successfully for the eternal prosperity of the country, he said that in order to develop the country in a sustainable and far-sighted manner, priority should be given to them and efforts be channelled into their development, rather than visible successes.\n\nIn recent years our Party has made substantial achievements in these fields by taking proactive measures to boost them as required by a higher stage of the developing revolution, he said. And he analysed and reviewed drawbacks in the fields and their causes.\n\nHe set forth a strategic slogan \"Let us make a leap forward by dint of science and guarantee the future by dint of education!\" and specified the tasks and ways to put spurs to building a sci-tech and talent power.\n\nHe pointed to the need to pay primary attention to ensuring strategic concentration in working out plans and providing guidance for sci-tech development and to expand the nationwide sci-tech diffusion network and decisively improve the operation of sci-tech learning space in each region, sector and unit as required by the undertaking to make all the people well-versed in science and technology.\n\nTo effect a great revolution in education work provides a decisive guarantee for implementing the Party\u2019s plan for making our country filled with talents, he said, underlining the necessity to put primary efforts to building up the camp of teachers and enhancing their qualifications and responsibility.\n\nTo bring about a revolutionary turn in science and education, he noted, it is imperative to radically increase state investment in them and make a climate of prioritizing them prevail throughout society.\n\nHe called on each of the members and alternate members of the Party Central Committee to take charge of one problem arising in science and education and resolve it in a responsible manner so as to set an example for officials and Party members to follow, and take the lead in making the whole society brim with the climate.\n\nThe mightiness of the country and the happiness of posterity hinge on how we who shoulder heavy responsibility for a prosperous socialist country and beloved younger generation toil and moil, he said, and appealed for making strenuous efforts for a revolutionary turn in science and education with a high sense of responsibility as Party members and patriotism.\n\nSpeeches were made on the second agenda item by Pak Thae Song, member of the Political Bureau and vice-chairman of the WPK Central Committee, Kim Su Gil, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the WPK Central Committee and chairman of the Pyongyang Municipal Party Committee, and Kim Sung Du, chairman of the Education Commission.\n\nThey said in unison that discussing science and education first at the plenary meeting of the Party Central Committee which was held to declare the great victory of the simultaneous-push policy and put forward a new strategic line fully shows the Party attaches great importance and gives priority to science and education.\n\nThey said that Juche-oriented science and education have made rapid progress and lots of achievements have been made under the wise leadership and meticulous care of Chairman Kim Jong Un, demonstrating the advantages and might of Korean-style socialism.\n\nThey expressed their resolve to fulfil their responsibility and role in developing the country into a sci-tech power, a country of education and a talent power, cherishing the lofty intention of the Supreme Leader who attaches utmost importance to science and education and puts them forward as the top priority task for the development of the revolution.\n\nResolution on the second agenda item \u201cOn bringing about a revolutionary turn in science and education\u201d was adopted.","created_utc":1524361697,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

Is the perception of meaningful choice identical to meaningful choice?\n\nAs for the difficulties of controlling the intelligentsia -- you act as though it was impossible for the majority to discipline and control a minority, but today a minority disciplines and controls the majority.\n\nAs for work requirements -- in general unavoidable in society. Work has to get done to make anything happen, like maintaining basic human life functions. My view -- the USSR and PRC didn't get to grips with every aspect of doing this right but transforming society is also extremely complicated and easy to fuck up even if you do have the right overall line-- is that repressive policies like that are only really needed for the first generation of intellectuals who were brought up under capitalism. Once socialist political power has been established you can start bringing up a new generation of intellectuals who are less likely to engage in self-serving anti-social behaviors like that. \n\nThis is entirely possible even if we say that socialist states are actually capitalist states (as many anarchists say). Whether or not Cuba is socialist in a couple generations they have created a situation where they have the largest medical school in the world, their main export is doctors, yet their doctors are paid dirt.

{"author":"EireOfTheNorth","body":"&gt; He didn't just speak strongly he executed and tortured prisoners.\n\nHe sentenced prisoners to execution as part of a tribunal based on the Nuremberg Trials, which happened just over ten years previous to the Cuban Revolution. So it was very much the norm to sentence war criminals to death in that time in history - the US did it, Britain did it, USSR did it. You can't just say \"Hey when Cuba did it it was *wrong!*\"\n\nThe Tribunal that judged and sentenced former members of Batistas army, and thieves\/bandits\/rapists to death consisted of Ch\u00e9, a member of public, I think there was also a doctor, and around two others to total five decision makers when it came to punishment for war crimes. So, when his vote consisted of one fifth of the decision, and the revolutionary trials were overwhelmingly demanded by the Cuban populace... how much blame can you place on him, and how much are you projecting on him to serve a long trodden agenda?\n\n&gt; His words of love love in stark contrast to his bloodthirsty actions.\n\nHis words of love, like being instrumental in the free healthcare program in Cuba, like in his internationalist healthcare support (which continues in Cuba to this day btw). Cuba has the second highest doctor\/patient ratio in the world today, thanks to Ch\u00e9's vision for Cuban healthcare. How many lives has that saved? As I pointed out previously too, after each skirmish he would set free as many prisoners as he could, if they were shot\/injured, he would leave behind a few revolutionaries to ensure the enemy combatants were seen to and treated as much as possible. This is talked about in his diaries, as well as numerous testimonials from Batista troops who encountered Ch\u00e9's column. Does that sound bloodthirsty? He could easily have wiped out every enemy he encountered - but he fought until they surrendered, treated those who were injured, took their weaponry\/military equipment, and set them free. This was in between setting up free clinics for peasants and treating men\/women\/children for free anytime he entered a village.\n\n&gt; His willingness to nuke the USA shows he has no love for human life just an overwhelming will to impose his ideology on others whatever the cost.\n\nThe threatening of the usage of nuclear weapons is common enough when relations between two countries are tense. It's inevitably all bravado, as no sane person would use nukes (because of M.A.D). Just a few months ago the United States were threatening to use nukes in North Korea, and North Korea were threatening to use them back.

He was always off doing something, whether it was fighting in the Congo, or in Bolivia, or on trade missions for Cuba etc. Aleida said that while she may have been young when he died, she still has a lot of good memories of the time they spent together, and even recalled the times she received letters from her father from all parts of the world where he would tell her stories to help her sleep at night about animals and such. We only talked briefly - I was in attendance at a meeting commemorating Ch\u00e9's untimely death, and for fundraising for the Cuban hurricane relief fund. She talked at length about the need for compassion and internationalism in the 21st century, talked about Irish and Latin American relations (even joking that without Latin America we wouldn't have the potato!), and of course, she railed against the embargo and its lethal effects on Cuba and its populace (pointing out that it has caused the deaths of some 40 thousand+ infants and children over the course of the embargo as the US bans US pharmaceutical companies from selling to Cuba, and some hold very important patents on certain medicines).\n\nWhen she was visiting here in Belfast, she visited the City Hospital and the medical students there at Queen's University Belfast. She also paid visits to women's shelters and a food bank if I remember correctly. She also used a local taxi worker cooperative to get around instead of ubering\/chauffeuring\/private taxi'ing :')\n\nBefore we parted ways I even got a little photo with her to remember her by!","created_utc":1524427065,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"amerikkkan_alien","body":"I'm 21 years old now. I turned to radical beliefs such as communism, nationalism for being brown\/brown pride (something that isn't even a thing in Amerikkka), and other beliefs such as radical humanism. I was always in a state of rebellion due to my identity, what I was, was perceived to be evil. Therefore I never saw communism as wrong because they preached it to be \"bad\" in school, they also preached muslims and the middle east in general to be the \"bad guys.\" Ideologies of Communism and Brown Pride just struck me the most, I'm an avid reader and an artist. I felt alienated since a young age and most of the racists towards me were these liberal progressives you speak of, therefore I automatically hated such an ideology from the start or at least after Obama started bombing the middle east and my country (Pakistan). Maybe it had something to do with art that drove me to communism as well because I realize under capitalism art is nothing but a commodity. Being a brown artist in Amerikkka helped me get into Marx who was saying something akin to \"your soul should be in your occupation\/whatever you are creating.\" Not to mention I was also an anti-imperialist by disposition of being a brown muslim in Amerikkka. you either have two choices as a brown muslim in America; to somehow erase your identity and became white washed (this doesn't really work for brown muslims, but you can just be the joke in a racist white persons social group in order to \"fit in\"), or too be strong and radical about self love and identity. The later usually leads to political beliefs that tend to be radical, of course I know many muslims who aren't communist but almost all of them hold some type of anti-imperialist views. Overall I would say it was my identity as a brown pakistani muslim, an artist (also loved hiphop growing up such as 2pac, dead prez, etc) , a curious mind, discrimination against me and me being a rebellious child is what led me to communism by the age of 13. The first figure I truly identified was Mao Zedong, I really resonated with his literature, work, and even aesthetic as an artist myself. I felt as if Mao was talking to the third world or to all colored people. I was arrested by the age of 14 so my beliefs became even more radical fairly quickly.

From 1934 to 1938 Beria was First Secretary of the Communist Party in Georgia, this takes up most of the time period of the Great Purge (37-38).  By mid-1938 it had become clear to Stalin and his allies in the USSR leadership that something had to be done about Yezhov, who was going out of control with repressions of innocent people with the goal of undermining the government and seizing power for himself (along with allies among the regional First Secretaries, who continually pushed for more repressive powers and opposed Stalin's plans for greater democracy because it got in the way of them carving out their own personal fiefdoms).  \n\n&gt;Yezhov bears great personal responsibility for the destruction of legality, for the falsification of investigative cases.\n\n-from Stalinist Terror: New Perspectives by J. Arch Getty and Roberta Manning.\n\nBeria had established himself as not only a highly effective manager, but also as one of the few First Secretaries during this time that the central leadership could trust.  He was put into the position of Deputy Chief of the NKVD to begin the process of breaking Yezhov's control over the security apparatus.\n\n&gt;In November 1938 Yezhov was convinced to resign his position as head of the NKVD.  We are not exactly sure how everything happened.  There is some evidence that Yezhov and his men planned one final desperate attempt at seizure of power... Zhukov claims to have seen Yezhov's actual resignation and claims it was done in a rushed way, on any scrap of paper available.  Zhukov concludes from this that Yezhov was only persuaded to resign with difficulty.  As soon as Yezhov resigned, to be replaced by Beria, orders were given to immediately stop all the repressions, to repeal all of the NKVD Operational Orders that enabled them, to stop the work of the troikas, and to re-emphasize the need for oversight by the Prosecutor's office of all cases of arrest.\n\n-from Blood Lies by Grover Furr. \n\nI'll make a second post where I address your other questions in a bit, have to go get some work done.","created_utc":1524497129,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

The state as a tool of class rule will become irrelevant because there will no longer be classes, so it and its fundamental structures (such as the police and military) can eventually wither away, but it is completely idealistic and unrealistic to think that there would no longer be any need for a regulatory and government-like body to ensure the logistical infrastructure of society (roads, distribution of goods, electrical power networks, sewage lines, garbage disposal, etc.) keeps functioning and that disputes have a platform to be settled within. The idea of communism is to remove the tools that the bourgeoise have used to maintain the existence of their class: money, private property, inheritance of wealth, etc. The goal is not to break down society entirely, but to use what has already been built and build more with the goals being for the benefit of all, rather than for the profit of a few to the detriment of most.

{"author":"randomweirdtrivia","body":"OK, part 2.  Apologies in advance for this being really damn long.\n\n&gt;Did he not oversee mass deportations and war crimes during WWII?\n\nYes, there were deportations during WWII.  It was a hard thing, but when you're facing the most murderous invasion in human history you're going to have to do hard things to survive.  Also in many cases the groups in question had disproportionate numbers of Nazi collaborators.\n\n&gt;A number of Caucasian and near-Caucasian people had shown themselves disloyal. The Chechens, Ingushes, the Balkarians, the people of Karachay, the Tatars of Crimea and the Kalmyks had indeed fought equally against the Nazis and the Soviet \u2018imperialisms\u2019. The Karachay people had openly welcomed the Germans under General Kleist and the prime mover in this astonishing act had been none other than the Chairman of the Provincial Executive Committee of the Soviets of the Karachay Autonomous Province. The Crimean Tatars were still working together with the Germans exterminating all the Russians they could, especially the Party members. There was an anti-Soviet partisan war in progress. \n\n-from Comrade X by Grigori Tokaev (an anti-Soviet conspirator in the Red Army who defected to Britain after the war).\n\n&gt;As German troops overran western Russia in July and August 1941, they came across German villages.  When German (or Romanian) soldiers arrived in such a village, they were greeted as liberators.  Some of them (the Soviet Germans,Ed.) volunteered to work in the Reich during the war. Some of these defected fully to the Nazis and served in the German armed forces.\n\n-from From Catherine to Khrushchev: The Story of Russia's Germans by Adam Geisinger.\n\n&gt;Did he not set up Soviet puppet governments in Central Europe after the war undemocratically?\n\nNo.  First of all, Beria was transferred in 1946 from being the head of the NKVD to running the atomic bomb project, understandably a top priority for the USSR at the time.  Second, the whole idea of \"setting up Soviet puppet governments in Central Europe undemocratically\" isn't true.\n\n&gt;I visited Rumania after the Russian occupation. All the government authorities and the common people testified to the fact that Russia gave freedom to the democratic elements in Rumania to govern themselves. \n\n- from Behind Soviet Power by Jerome Davis\n\n&gt;In the first two years after the war, only Yugoslavia and Albania could be described as single-party Communist states, although even here the name was avoided in favor of the People\u2019s Front and Democratic Front. The governments of the other five\u2013 Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria\u2013were all coalitions. In two cases at least ( Czechoslovakia and Hungary) they were genuine coalitions in which several parties with their own organizations and very different views combined to carry out a short-term radical program with such reforms as the redistribution of land.\n\n- from Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives by Alan Bullock.\n\n&gt;On 28 January 1945 Stalin said, \u201cWe have no wish to impose anything on the other Slavic peoples. We do not interfere in their internal affairs. Let them do what they can.\n\n-from The Diary of Georgi Dimitrov, 1933-1949.\n\n&gt;Also what about the claim made by Kruschev that Beria abandoned communism and Stalinism basically the second Stalin died? I heard somewhere that he was pushing for an end to communism in the satellite states and an end to collectivization.\n\nOn these questions Khrushchev is a confirmed liar and untrustworthy.  Khrushchev Lied by Grover Furr is the key work on this, but even anti-Stalin sources confirm it.\n\n&gt;Nor do I take all of Khrushchev\u2019s \u2018revelations\u2019 at their face value: I do not accept, in particular, his assertion that Stalin\u2019s role in the Second World War is virtually insignificant. This allegation was obviously meant to boost Khrushchev himself at Stalin\u2019s expense; and it does not accord with the testimonies of many reliable eyewitnesses, of Western statesmen, and generals who had no reason to exaggerate Stalin\u2019s role, and of Soviet generals who have recently written on this subject in a sober and critical vein.\n\n-from Stalin: A Political Biography by Isaac Deutscher\n\n&gt;I heard somewhere that he was pushing for an end to communism in the satellite states and an end to collectivization.\n\nHe supported the peaceful reunification of Germany into a neutral, demilitarized state, which Stalin also did, as did Molotov at one point as well (though he would later reverse himself).\n\n&gt;To achieve this goal Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov\nargued for German demilitarization and the creation of a German political system that assured a significant role for German Communists.\n\n- from [here](https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=14&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVmfSI0Z7aAhVD12MKHdZIBgQQFgh2MA0&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wilsoncenter.org%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2FACFB73.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw0sKSy5zr9AaWKW2m7t9Yzj)\n\nAs for the \"end to collectivization,\" [this](http:\/\/redcomrades.byethost5.com\/redcomrades\/beria.html?i=1) is a good comment on it.\n\n&gt;There were only THEORIES or ACCUSATIONS against Beria to that effect, primarily based on his desire to return to a NEP-type system for awhile after WWII . Well, Lenin did it after the Civil War for the same reasons Beria wanted to do it after World War II.\n\nHe was no saint, and did IMO made mistakes, serious ones (as has every leader).  His policy on providing for greater autonomy in the non-Russian Republics was sound in theory but had some problems in execution, and I think he probably went too far in wanting to separate the government and Party (I can elaborate if need be but this post is long enough as it is), but there's so many different varieties of bullshit floating around it can be hard to cut through it to identify the real areas of criticism.","created_utc":1524507596,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"intlnews","body":" Here's what they note on twitter, which I'm reprinting here because I detest twitter for various reasons, including minimization of thought. I have removed links to photos on twitter and other links, as a more through analysis of the group is noted in my other comment. Below are my comments on each section. I also added in links to certain works.\n\n&gt; Let\u2019s dissect the term and\/or concept of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and how it has been mistakenly used over the last few years by Liberals, Conservatives, and confused Leftists drawn into misinformation and propaganda (once and for all). You might want to bookmark this thread.\n\nThat is true, the term is often misused. I think the people who use it are well meaning but undoubtedly confused without question.\n\n&gt; We want to begin by recommending that \u201cwhite\u201d Americans new to the idea of Socialism read both volumes of Theodore W. Allen\u2019s [\u201cThe Invention of the White Race\u201d](https:\/\/www.counterpunch.org\/2013\/05\/21\/the-invention-of-the-white-race\/) before even THINKING about cracking into [\u201cDas Kapital\u201d](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1867-c1\/) or any of the Socialist \u201cclassics\u201d.\n\nI think its better to read socialist works first, then move onto Allen's work. After all, Marx has strong  abolitionist sentiments. You need a basis before moving onto something else.\n\nMarx mentioned slavery varied times in Capital, also noting former slavery of Black individuals in Britain:\n\n&gt; As the taste of the porridge does not tell you who grew the oats, no more does this simple process tell you of itself what are the social conditions under which it is taking place, whether under the slave-owner\u2019s brutal lash, or the anxious eye of the capitalist, whether Cincinnatus carries it on in tilling his modest farm or a savage in killing wild animals with stones...This is one of the circumstances that makes production by slave labour such a costly process. The labourer here is, to use a striking expression of the ancients, distinguishable only as instrumentum vocale, from an animal as instrumentum semi-vocale, and from an implement as instrumentum mutum. But he himself takes care to let both beast and implement feel that he is none of them, but is a man. He convinces himself with immense satisfaction, that he is a different being, by treating the one unmercifully and damaging the other con amore. Hence the principle, universally applied in this method of production, only to employ the rudest and heaviest implements and such as are difficult to damage owing to their sheer clumsiness. In the slave-states bordering on the Gulf of Mexico, down to the date of the civil war, ploughs constructed on old Chinese models, which turned up the soil like a hog or a mole, instead of making furrows, were alone to be found. - [chapter 7](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1867-c1\/ch07.htm)\n\n&gt; Capital has not invented surplus-labour. Wherever a part of society possesses the monopoly of the means of production, the labourer, free or not free, must add to the working-time necessary for his own maintenance an extra working-time in order to produce the means of subsistence for the owners of the means of production, whether this proprietor be the Athenian calo\u03c2 cagaqo\u03c2 [well-to-do man], Etruscan theocrat, civis Romanus [Roman citizen], Norman baron, American slave-owner, Wallachian Boyard, modern landlord or capitalist...The slave-owner buys his labourer as he buys his horse. If he loses his slave, he loses capital that can only be restored by new outlay in the slave-mart...For slave-trade read labour-market, for Kentucky and Virginia, Ireland and the agricultural districts of England, Scotland, and Wales, for Africa, Germany...In the United States of North America, every independent movement of the workers was paralysed so long as slavery disfigured a part of the Republic. **Labour cannot emancipate itself in the white skin where in the black it is branded.** But out of the death of slavery a new life at once arose. The first fruit of the Civil War was the eight hours\u2019 agitation, that ran with the seven-leagued boots of the locomotive from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from New England to California. - [chapter 10](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1867-c1\/ch10.htm)\n\n&gt; now the capitalist buys children and young persons under age. Previously, the workman sold his own labour-power, which he disposed of nominally as a free agent. Now he sells wife and child. He has become a slave-dealer. **The demand for children\u2019s labour often resembles in form the inquiries for negro slaves**, such as were formerly to be read among the advertisements in American journals. - [chapter 15](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1867-c1\/ch15.htm)\n\nIt also was briefly mentioned in [chapter 13](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1867-c1\/ch13.htm) and [chapter 9](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1867-c1\/ch09.htm), while it is in a [different context in Chapter 6](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1867-c1\/ch06.htm), [chapter 3](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1867-c1\/ch03.htm), and [chapter 1](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1867-c1\/ch01.htm). There is also a mention in [chapter 2](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1867-c1\/ch02.htm)\n\n&gt; In order to engage with this discussion, it is imperative that you first understand WHY we refer to \u201crace\u201d as a \u201csocial construct,\u201d and understand how it differs from \u201cethnicity.\u201d Peep the thread below as an intro to \u201crace vs. ethnicity\u201d when\/if you can. \n\nGender is arguably a social construct as well.\n\n&gt; You\u2019ve heard the clich\u00e9, \u201cthere\u2019s only one race: the human race,\u201d and it is TRUE, but society does not reflect this reality yet, for those supporting white supremacy (an IDEA) want a place in the racial\/socioeconomic hierarchy instead of destroying the hierarchy altogether.\n\nIts more than the white supremacists who support such White supremacy. Its a general sentiment among White people in the U$ as Martin Luther King, Jr. noted toward the end of his life.\n\n&gt; When the first Africans arrived in VA in 1619, there were no \u201cwhite\u201d people there with them, but \u201cBritish\u201d people. According to colonial records, there wouldn\u2019t be \u201cwhite\u201d people there for another 60 years. The hands of imperialism extended from ETHNO-STATES; not RACIAL groups.\n\nThat may be true but racial divisions were already coming about through transatlantic slavery, and the British were only one of the European powers engaging in the slave trade.\n\n&gt; Other Europeans coming to America? Poorer Europeans coming to America? Potential for poor and working class solidarity? \u201cOh no,\u201d the ruling-class Europeans thought. \u201cLet\u2019s construct a racial hierarchy; the psychological \u2018wage\u2019 we give whites will divide the proletariat.\u201d\n\nI've also read that this was the case as well, that having solidarity among White and Black laborers was feared by the elites in English America. Systems of oppression developed in French-controlled, short-lived Dutch-controlled, Portuguese-controlled, and Spanish-controlled parts of the Western hemisphere as well, but not in the same ways as the English.\n\n&gt; One could compare British rule in Ireland with a similar form of \u201cwhite\u201d oppression of Indigenous and Black Americans, but Irish immigrants fleeing persecution learned to SPREAD racial oppression in their adoptive country as a part of \u201cwhite\u201d American assimilation. Unfortunate.\n\nI think there was definitely a strong comparison. If I remember Noel Ignatiev's book, [How the Irish Became White](https:\/\/www.counter-currents.com\/2012\/12\/how-the-irish-became-white-part-1\/) correctly, some Irish lived with Black laborers, and many supported abolitionism, although this was cast aside in order to assimilate into White America. \n\n&gt; \u201cWhite privilege\u201d has enforced the myth of racial superiority; this has been central to maintaining RULING-CLASS domination over poor and working class people of ALL colors throughout AMERICAN history. \u201cWhite privilege\u201d ultimately hurts poor and working class \u201cwhite\u201d Americans.\n\nUndoubtedly so. Such racial superiority is a myth but it is ingrained in the capitalist structure of the U$, so in that way it a horrifying reality.\n\n&gt; Now that we have this established, let\u2019s comment on \u201cwhite privilege\u201d (the term) as it was originally COINED and used by Theodore W. Allen in the 1960s, and as it is popularly (and mistakenly) misused today in 2018.\n\u201cWhite privilege\u201d was originally referred to as \u201cwhite skin privilege,\u201d and it was a term coined by Theodore W. Allen under a class-based analysis. What happens when you remove the class-based analysis? You get Capitalist control of the narrative, and more division as a result.\n\nGood point. The usual conception of \"white privilege\" is not class-based, making it an utterly failed analysis. \n\n&gt; What Liberal and Conservative media have done is create a dynamic where poor and working class white Americans don\u2019t feel as though they have any room to move in solidarity with poor and working class Black Americans, and vice versa; common \u201cSJW\u201d RHETORIC deepens these rifts.\n\nPerhaps so. I remember that MLK at the end of his life was talking about and organizing cross-racial solidarity between poor &amp; working-class Blacks and Whites.","created_utc":1524508527,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"intlnews","body":"Continued.\n\n\n\n&gt; When egoists throw out terms like \u201ccheck your privilege,\u201d they seem more concerned with placing white Americans in a lose-lose situation instead of highlighting a ceding of power to the ruling class based upon manufactured social structures, and creating a pathway for solidarity.\n\nUndoubtedly. The whole idea of \"checking your privilege\" is almost to make privileged people feel better about themselves, which is messed up indeed.\n\n&gt; Explanations for white supremacy that only rely on \u201cbiology\u201d or attribute it to benefits gained by all \u201cwhite\u201d Americans are fundamentally incomplete, for they analyze \u201crace\u201d within a vacuum; there is always a socioeconomic component that must be addressed in this conversation.\n\nUndoubtedly so. Class is interlinked and connected with race, classism links with racism. They really can't be separated. \n\n&gt; W.E.B. DuBois said in [\u201cBlack Reconstruction\u201d](https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/blackreconstruc00dubo): \"Race was supplemented by a carefully planned and slowly evolved method, which drove such a wedge between the white and black workers...There prob\u00ada\u00adbly are not today in the world two groups of work\u00aders with practically identical interests who hate and fear each other so deeply and persistently and who are kept so far apart that neither sees anything of common interest.\u201d\n\n\n\nGood point. Such a racist wedge between White and Black workers extends to Chican@ workers, Asian workers, Puerto Rican workers, and many more. \n\n&gt; Phrases like \u201ccheck your privilege\u201d are commonly used today, but NOT to speak to the reality that poor and working class white Americans are ceding power to Capitalist exploiters who couldn\u2019t care less about them (or us). We must address the ILLUSION of \u201crace\u201d FIRST.\n\nAlso a valid point. I am reminded of groups like [Redneck Revolt](https:\/\/www.redneckrevolt.org\/) which aim to point out this reality.\n\n&gt; We agree with Allen; the \u201cwhite race\u201d must be understood, not simply as a social construct (as opposed to a genetic phenomenon), but as a \u201cruling class social control formation.\u201d \u201cRACE\u201d and \u201cWHITE PRIVILEGE\u201d are \u201cRULING CLASS SOCIAL CONTROL FORMATIONS\u201d (divide and conquer).\n\nAgain, a valid point. But, it also shouldn't be just a black-white divide, there are varied races in the U$. \n\n&gt; Noel Ignatiev, author of \u201cHow the Irish Became White,\u201d has a great quote that we\u2019ll end this thread with: \u201cThe ending of white supremacy is not solely a demand of the Negro people, separate from the class demands of the entire working class. It cannot be left to the Negro people to fight it alone, while the white workers 'sympathize with their fight,' 'support it,' 'reject racist slanders' etc. but actually fight for their 'own' demands. The ideology of white chauvinism is bourgeois poison aimed primarily at the white workers, utilized as a weapon by the ruling class to subjugate black and white workers.\"\n\nAgain this is a valid point. Racism, or what he calls white chauvinism, is just one tool of the capitalist class, like sexism or homophobia.","created_utc":1524508564,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"StalinIII","body":"I'm sorry, but as someone with one foot in the US and the other in Norway, I have to strongly disagree with you both in terms of Red and DSA. They are both, without a doubt, social democratic organizations.\n\n**tl;dr You can't just say that you are against capitalism, then do everything in your power to reinforce capitalism and the capitalist state, and then complain when people say that are are a capitalist.**\n\n#R\u00f8dt\n\n###Bad Theory\n1. **General confusion about basic Marxist principles.** R\u00f8dt mentions *once* in all of their materials (as far as I know) that their goal is a classless society: \"what Marx called communism\". Yet, in their program, they do not speak about how they intend to achieve this goal. Nor do they ever distinguish between socialism and communism. In fact, in almost every public space they have at their disposal, they speak only about how they intend to achieve socialism. The way I see it, there are one of three things at play here: 1) they are intentionally watering down their rhetoric so that they are more approachable (which I think is dishonest and also I think necessarily weakens the argument that they are socialists--more on this in a moment), 2) they do not themselves understand that there is a difference between socialism and communism, or 3) they have no intention to work to make socialism tenable and their appropriation of Marxism only goes as far as the rhetoric returns results for their numbers. My money is on the latter, but let's table that for now.\n2. **No serious plan for communism.** It may seem like an issue of semantics, but understanding the difference between socialism and communism is *essential* if a communist movement is to be effective. As Lenin said, \"The goal of socialism is communism.\" Without an understanding of the fact that between capitalism and communism there must be a transition stage--socialism--that can be nothing other than the dictatorship of the proletariat, then there is no genuine plan for reaching this classless society. If your goal is \"socialism\" because \"it's a good balance between capitalism and communism\", then you are not describing socialism. You are describing social democracy. Socialism can look very different in different circumstances and different places, but there are at base two absolutely essential requirements: 1) socialism must be a dictatorship of the proletariat, i.e. the working class has complete control and monopoly on the legitimate use of violence and 2) socialism must be temporary and in constant motion, i.e. at all points, all actions must incline towards abolishing classes and capital entirely.\n3. **No serious plan for socialism.** Even awarded with the benefit of the doubt, it is clear that even if R\u00f8dt as a party understood this long-term strategy, and have simply adapted different terminology for rhetorical value, they are by no means organizing to reach socialism. They write: \"Red believes that there are many examples that show that counterforces will not accept a popular and democratic demonstration of power, but will use unacceptable means to stop it. This will make it necessary to protect the will of the people. The safest bet for getting a good result is if that working class is well organized and has set clear goals.\" In addition to the fact that Red has *openly* demonstrated that they do not have any clear goals, you will notice that their strategy for preparing the working class for taking the power is limited entirely to parliamentary means. Despite the fact that they openly admit that the bourgeoisie *can, will, and has* used unacceptable violence against peaceful \"revolution\", there is a complete rejection of militarizing workers. My interpretation is that either 1) they recognize and even explicitly state what needs to be done to protect the revolution, but they naively believe that the socialism fairy will save them at the last moment without any prior preparations for revolution or 2) they know full well that their strategy will not allow for socialist revolution, but it sounds nice and gets them a lot of votes. Again, maybe I'm too cynical, but my money is on the latter, given that in the next breath, they say that the most important thing is growing the party numbers (and, of course, all of the dues that these members will be paying).\n4. **Complete rejection of historical developments.** Red claims that we need a system that is completely different from the one we have today. I agree. Yet, at the same time, they have an entire section dedicated to \"socialist models\". Not once are the two most successful socialist models in human history mentioned: the USSR and China. Not only do they fail to mention them, but one cannot find a single criticism of these projects. Whether this is common chauvinism or if it is part of their strategy to water down Marxism in order to gain broader appeal is unclear to me, but even if they disagree that the USSR and China were examples of socialist models, the lack of so much as a rejection is unacceptable for a so-called Marxist party. Not least, they then continue to say that all they want is an expansion of democracy in the current system. Verbatim: \"[sosialistiske ideer] m\u00e5 bygge p\u00e5 en utvidelse av demokratiet,\" or \"socialist ideas must be a development of democracy\". One could possible interpret their points about a new system as compatible with socialism, but the examples they give are limited to diverting goods and services to welfare programs. While they say that \"it's not just more state spending\". Huh?\n\n#Bad Praxis\n1. **What have they accomplished?** This is not just a consideration of what they have accomplished, but also *what they have said they are going to accomplish*. Their claim is that socialism can be achieved by voting in the election. How exactly is this the case? When will they propose a bill that says \"this parliament is hereby dissolved, and it will be replaced by a dictatorship of the proletariat\"? Or even one that says \"all private property will be appropriated for centralized planning within xx years\"? Any measure that would take us from a class society with private ownership to a classless society with no private ownership: is there a single one? Of course it would be unreasonable to accuse Red of failing to actually implement these reforms when we are living in a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, but where is there even a concrete strategy--intention even--for doing so?\n2. **What have they done instead?** Instead, they have entered into agreements and coalitions with the other parties, promising to support war criminals like AP! The people who are today bombing Syria! The freaking party of the man who went from PM to the head of NATO! In exchange for the lives of thousands of Syrian children, Red has gotten its voters... a little extra funding for a kindergarten somewhere. On what planet is this anything else than social democracy?\n3. **But surely they must have done SOMETHING!** As of today, I can almost guarantee you that all Red resources are dedicated to election campaigns. I have spoken with a handful of people from Red, and all but exactly one person is involved with politics outside of election season. Not in the capacity of Red, but rather with other groups like Amnesty. A party organized to elect members to parliament: that is a social democratic party.\n4. **Well, they did also call the cops on anti-racists.** Yes, [seriously](https:\/\/tjen-folket.no\/Sentralt\/view\/11408). [Here is another source](https:\/\/www.aftenbladet.no\/lokalt\/i\/XEopB\/-Nodvendig-a-vise-motstand-mot-NDL#.T-szV7U0MXs).\n5. **What about their arbitrary guidelines?** I do not accept Red's guidelines for building a communist party. They fly in the face of 150 years of proletarian and revolutionary communist experiences. Both in terms of theory *and* practice, everything about Red points in one direction: aggrandizing Moxnes. But even if we don't take such a cynical approach, by what litmus could one say that Red is effectively organizing the masses for communism? Communism is mentioned *only* one time in all of their literature! Clearly they aren't doing a very good job of educating the masses in Marxism, which is objectively *the least you could do*. Workplaces are not organized. Nobody is armed. Nobody is made to understand what the revolution entails. It is beyond reprehensible that they imply that violence will ensue if they are successful, but that they will refuse to use violence themselves, and offer only vague arguments of \"we can protect the people if we are all together\". *What does that even mean?!* At best, it's a cynical lie to garner votes from \"radical\" environments. At worst, it's putting people in grave danger and lying to them about the nature of this danger.\n\n#Miscellaneous\nFinally, we can add that even the [major bourgeois news agencies](https:\/\/www.nrk.no\/norge\/rodt-_-pa-fornavn-med-makta-1.13633639) rank Red as a social democratic party, a charge that has gone unanswered by anybody at Red. In fact, when asked to draw a distinction between his party and other social democrats, Moxnes was unable to give an answer! Add on top of this that local Red leaders have explicitly tweeted that there is nothing wrong with capitalism!\n\nYou can read more about why Red is a social democratic party [here](https:\/\/tjen-folket.no\/Sentralt\/view\/12412), [here](https:\/\/tjen-folket.no\/Sentralt\/view\/12394), [here](https:\/\/tjen-folket.no\/Sentralt\/view\/12422), and [here](https:\/\/tjen-folket.no\/sentralt\/view\/11976) is a page with the collected texts on the election boycotts in Norway.\n\n#DSA\n\nDSA is an almost identical party, considering the above points. It is probably worse. I mean *they endorsed Obama for fuck's sake*. There really isn't much more to say about that. But I won't get further into it, just because I'm running out of space and because I've already spent a heeeeelll of a lot of time writing this already.

Not saying I'm to be felt sorry for, many people get through worse.\n\n\nI already was commie-friendly when this happened, but I'm rested since October because my job broke my body (working in a office, yes). If my company wasn't weird (low pay but they keep paying me full wages what the  hell), I'd be in deep shit. \n\n\nAnd I'm like 10% above minimum French wage by hour and I work more than the maximum 35 hours so I'm about 25% above minimum. People live near Paris like me with less money. They can break like me and have a normal company which wouldn't just continue to pay them.

{"author":"YoutubersID","body":"Yes, Mexico has a huge debt, and it has radically increased in the last 15\\-30 years.\n\nIf you analyze a graph regarding our debt, and link it with official governmental speeches, when our country achieves the slightest thing resembling a balance, aka when the debt doesn't increase as expected, the government celebrates. Correct me if I'm wrong but just a couple years ago in Mexico the government acquired one of the biggest loans in recent years in order to improve the \"subway\" system in GDL and surrounding areas. And with this increasing debt, and recent decisions taken by our current government our currency is quickly falling, the last thing we need, is for the debt to keep spiking in a country that is not ready to fund millions of citizens. A type of investment like that with little to not impact on our economy would deeply damage our living conditions.\n\n\"Imperialist USA\", let me clarify: During a series of events we lost approximately 50&amp;#37; of our territory in 1846 and during the rule of Porfirio D\u00edaz we were hosts of one giant slave trade and hacienda system , that exploited workers with virtually no pay until they were dead. Even though this slavery system was held in Mexico and the government did nothing, it was all because of the US, since that time the US has had land and resources in our country. All the land and slaves were for them to exploit. Nowadays slavery is prohibited but still, Mexico means cheap labor force, and cheap land overall, other countries come here and exploit our resources, the money is not staying in Mexico. We cannot restart our economy while its slipping through our hands. If we want to implement communist ideas, we need to stop giving away our resources and looking up to the capitalist companies that are taking away the economy away from us.\n\nFor more information about the slave system you can read: \"Barbarous Mexico\"\n\nMaintain a capitalist system in order to prevent famine and rapid inflation?\n\nWe are at the edge of inflation, just in the last 10 years the dollar has \"gained\" value all the way from $3\\(Mexican pesos per Dollar\\) to $20.21 \\(MNX per USD\\) the Euro currently is at 25.8.\n\nCitizens are fighting in order for a 100&amp;#37; transparency law to be applied to government agencies \\(Ley 3 de 3 for your research\\)\n\nAMLO \\(The candidate\\) wrote a book where he condemned several officials for corruption, and now those same officials are part of his planned government. He has not answered, not a single question regarding transparency and fund distribution inside the government.\n\nI was vague while expressing my initial argument and question, I hope this clears up things.","created_utc":1524534685,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"amerikkkan_alien","body":"In summary Deng Xiaoping thought is reformism and opening up of China. Deng Xiaoping was the leader that consolidated power after Mao. Deng repudiated the Cultural Revolution, and attributed some blame for it on Mao as well as Mao's hand chosen Gang of Four. Deng is the one who said Mao was \"seven parts good, three parts bad\" as an excuse for his reformism. Deng rehabilitated those who were purged during the Cultural Revolution, reformed Mao's economic policies and began market reforms. Deng is responsible for ending the cultural revolution, let us not forget he was purged not ONCE but TWICE by Mao. Deng Thought is revisionist because he sought to develop a more market based approach to economy and practically let go of the revolutionary ideas that Mao put forward. It is self described as \u201ceconomic pragmatism.\u201d It was an opening up to the west and capitalist powers. Under Deng, US really established powerful trade relations with China. Deng did not really care about the revolution or revolutionaries as well he was practically just an economic pragmatist. Dengism is not only revisionism but it is a complete deviation from ML &amp; MLM as well as Maoism. Correcting his mistakes is something Xi seems like he is possibly willing to do (note POSSIBLY, I don't believe he really will). But as other comrades point out, that does not some likely. In order to correct mistakes China should follow the line of Maoism rather than Deng Xiaoping Theory, start supporting more revolutionary activity in the world, focus more on the goal of socialism than economic pragmatism\/market based socialism. Maybe restart or enact a similar approach to cultural revolution again. It is clear it was Deng who really pushed China to what it is right now, and away from Maoism.

{"author":"amerikkkan_alien","body":"writing positively about Mao on occasions is not overall being positive on his legacy or actions. Deng repudiated the Cultural Revolution, and attributed some blame for it on Mao as well as Mao's hand chosen Gang of Four. Not to mention Deng's rebuking of Hua Guofeng, who was chosen as Mao's successor by Mao himself. Deng is the one who said Mao was \"seven parts good, three parts bad\" as an excuse for his reformism. Deng rehabilitated those who were purged during the Cultural Revolution, reformed Mao's economic policies and began market reforms. It was not possible for Deng to criticize Mao as he was a revolutionary and the founding father of China, someone who was deeply instilled in the hearts of the Chinese at a time. Instead he took down Mao in his policies, by criticizing his actions by saying he had a good intent but that he was bad in many regards. Let us not forget Deng was purged by Mao twice during the cultural revolution. You might be right about Xi which is why I said \"possibly\" and left it up the OP to decide himself. It just seems like Xi is trying to bring the CCP back to it's origins, I could easily be wrong about that. Deng was always careful of actually \"critcizing Mao\" when it came to paper but it is clear that Deng was not a supporter of Mao not only because he was purged, his son was tortured and made a paraplegic by the red guard but because Mao started the cultural revolution to get rid of Deng and his ideologies of market reform.

De-maoifying China was never a possibility as Mao was the founding father of China, fresh in the hearts and minds of the Chinese who loved him more than anyone else in China. This is the reason why Deng famously said Mao was 30% bad and 70% good, in order to justify their reformism. Using Mao as a symbol does nothing in terms of actual ideology and direction of the CCP. Note how Mao was only introduced as a symbol on Chinese currency after it was 100% clear that no one in his family\/ideology will be achieving power in China again. When Mao was first co-opted into Chinese currency in the 80's (the 4th edition) he was shown along aside Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhu De. It wasn't until the 5th series around 2000 where Mao was the only symbol co-opted on the bill, when it was clear that Mao's ideology and face was nothing but a symbol that invoked very little meaning in terms of Maoist ideology. Co-opting symbols is a classic tactic of not only capitalists but reformists and revisionists.  ","created_utc":1524607237,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"ZombyDyno","body":"Capitalism is not the act of self-realization, no, because capitalism is not the only way to work in any given society. Exploitation does not equate to realizing yourself through work. Percieved individual gains over societal gains are not a product of every civilization, which Marx notes tirelessly in his references to pre-class society; they are the inevitable conclusions of class-based society, in which the rulers rule in their self interest rather than those that they rule over, and the proletariat is told that one day they might, too, be in the position of an individual that benefits off the system rather than benefitting the system. \n\nIndividualism in of itself does not lead to greed; a society based around a set of individuals getting what they need while the rest starve and claw each other down like crabs is the reason individualism manifests itself in alienation in the way we see it. Individualism in a society made for the people is a cornerstone of socialism because socialism's goals are to liberate the proletariat rather than exploit their labor for individual gain. Individualism expresses oneself in their expressions of themselves, it doesn't necessarily have to be something antagonistic to a socialist state. Individualism can be realized through you benefiting your community,  which is the egoist socialist perspective on the matter if that's what drives you.  \n\nIndividual gain and individual interests is one of the biggest contradictions in capitalism simply because the proletariat doesn't gain anything from their exploitation, and as such work simply for the benefit of others.","created_utc":1524608396,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"dessalines_","body":"I just read over that quickly, and it doesn't contain any specific examples of transphobia \/ homophobia. In fact it seems pretty progressive to me: \n\n&gt; The system of gender norms was created and is reinforced because it provides real material benefit for the ruling class. This benefit is inextricably tied to the exploitation of female reproductive potential and the labor tied to that reproductive potential. It is not a coincidence that all of the features of femininity are tied to passivity and providing for others, with no concern for self. It\u2019s also no coincidence that the features of masculinity are tied to activity and enforcing one\u2019s will on others.\n\n&gt; In order to control female reproductive potential, it becomes necessary for the woman to see her body as belonging to the men of the family or society, as a whole, rather than herself. Her reproductive potential is why she exists. The children she bears will become the property of the men. The \u201cdefiled\u201d female body becomes a burden to the men. So, controlling her reproduction and sexuality becomes vital. Even today, this is why laws and cultural rules related to women focus on limiting contraceptive and abortion access, discouraging sexual activity outside of heterosexual marriage and punishing women who raise children on their own. Beyond laws and cultural dictates, the most efficient way of controlling female reproductive potential is to convince her that it is her peculiar nature to be focused solely on creating children for men, and then providing comfort to both the men and the children.\n\nTrans is only referenced once, and not in a negative context, so I don't know where you're getting that. \n ","created_utc":1524681501,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

Take, for example, him claiming that sex is not a social construct. Cockshott limits himself to only considering sex as ever possibly being genitalia, when in fact the very person he's referencing uses sex to refer to the multi-faceted ways not only we consider sex in a gendered way, thus creating socially constructed ideas of what it is to sexually be male, female, or otherwise, but also how biological sexual components such as chromosomes, anatomy, etc. are taken together and socially interpreted in a certain way. Nobody is arguing that basic biological processes and fundamental medical sex doesn't exist, but rather, Butler recognizes that how people socially interpret sex results in the social construction of sex, where the social construction of sex is not and never was insinuated to be equal to basic, medically defined sex. Paul Cockshott completely fails to understand this. It's not transphobic, it's just originating from a point of view of ignorance on the subject; he has no knowledge of what he's talking about in this scenario.","created_utc":1524688721,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

They see what's going on currently, and they see that ~~slavex~~ spacex is doing things on a consistent basis, within a relatively short time span (space being considered and all). \n\nIts really not that surprising given that we live in a capitalist world. Along with various other reasons. \n\nYou expect people to upvotes historical events or intellectuals that have contributed to space far more than the, practically, world renowned Elon Musk? Come on. 90% of the people subbed to \/r\/space couldn't even tell you what those people did, let alone identify them from a picture.\n\nHell. A Falcon 9 launch gets Xk upvotes but Ariane V, Soyuz, PSLV, and so on get maybe, just maybe a few hundred, if that.\n\nHell. The US public (which reddit is mostly US citizens) elected Trump. But you're shocked that \/r\/space has a capitalist, who has offered yogurt\/cake\/party instead of unionization, is the top of \/r\/space? Pay attention. We're docile and complacent. We have no idea what's going on. We've been taught to take a class and pass it. Not to remember and learn things. We aren't taught history or science of historical facts.\n\nI'd LOVE it for people to generally be aware of what's going on in space. It's my field of study and soon to be work. But the general public doesn't know or doesn't care. And that sucks (again, for various reasons). I wish they'd up vote\/discuss\/know about the MANY different things going on in space right now or in the past. But frankly, that's asking far too much of people who get their news from a monopoly on media\/teachers who are horribly underpaid and taught to teach things on a 4\/5 month period. It literally brings me to tears.\n\nHell. Every time there's a near Earth object people freak out. Or when Tiangong deorbited everyone freaked out about debris. I shouldn't NEED to go into detail about this, but I almost definitely have to for most people of why this is is ridiculous. \n\nPeople do not know or understand space. How could they? They're working 60 hours a week to put food on the table. And they see a person that's in the news often, they up vote. They see a dead person who has contributed far more to the space community, they scroll past.\n\nEdit. Also, don't idolize Neil. He's great. Love him. Listen to cosmos (old and new) every night while I sleep. But if he \"deserves\" to be the top post on \/r\/space (like that's an amazing achievement) than Musk does too. Landing a booster, and lowering the cost of launching things into orbit is an amazing feat by the spacex team.\n\nNeither of them should be the top. But don't idolize Neil like others do for Musk.\n\nEdit 2. I'm not arguing with you. It's just how I talk. I completely and utterly agree with you. Its gross that I can go out in public, mention Musk and everyone knows who I'm talking about, but I mention Newton or Einstein, Lowell, Tycho, Sagan, Cassini, or specifics about Venus, Mars, Ceres, Titan, Saturn, Uranus, they go blank. Let alone anything beyond our system.\n\nUgh. Sorry. Just this shit hits home. People don't understand what's above us, let alone what's actually going on in our economic system.

{"author":"[deleted]","body":"&gt; To start, Elon\u2019s development, use, and future-use, of self landing booster rockets. Cool, right. Who would\u2019ve thought someone could reuse parts and NOT discard of them after launches, for example the US government funded NASA, which still, after every launch\/flight, leaves boosters to float in space or come down to Earth.\n\n&gt; That\u2019s just one example of many, such as more efficient fuel, rockets able to carry way more due to the use of certain materials, and other things that Spacex has saved mass amounts of money on.\n\nThat isn't anything a government could not do.\n\n&gt; To answer your second question, a government isn\u2019t based around space travel, and other specific things. \n\nThere can be sectors of the government which allow for space travel. Like for example the government in the US isn't based around public transportation, however it still has a public transportation system that does well.\n\n&gt; A communist based government may certainly have the capacity and money to have the same team and rockets as Spacex, though, aside from my main point, that is just influencing a more elite class.\n\nI'm not sure how you jumped to the conclusion of a government-based program being equal in quality to SpaceX automatically influences an elite class. I'd argue that it's the other way around since under SpaceX most people in the world would never be able to ride rockets to space, while under a public system most people would (Just look at the airplane industry).\n\n&gt; Also, why would a government-run space program be needed in a Communist based Nation?\n\nPlease stop saying communist. Communism is a post-scarcity fully automated stateless, classless, moneyless society. You're argument is contingent upon debunking something you cannot define. Socialism is the\ntransition phase between capitalism and communism, so I assume that-that is what you mean. Anyway to answer your question, a government-run space program would be needed in a Socialist nation simply because of human desire. The pursuit of science. Why was the space program in the Soviet Union so successful?\n\n\n&gt; if there is a way to have an entire Corporation, or such equivalent, that can fund itself NOT using tax-payers money or and money within the government, why not have it like that?\n\nUnder an ideal socialist system there wouldn't be taxes because almost everything is run by the government. I don't see what's so bad about the government funding a space program if that's in the wishes of the citizens. I mean SpaceX uses a lot of government money so SpaceX is not completely independent of public funding.\n\n&gt; Spacex\u2019s efficient use of private investors, and even Elon himself, has funded a huge part of what they do today.

{"author":"IAmTheRedScare","body":"I'm a dues paying member of the CPUSA. As a Marxist Leninist, I disagree with a large portion of the party platform. I accept all of the common criticisms that you will find of the party here on Reddit. These are the reasons I'm a member. \n\n1. They are the only leftist organization in my area practicing any kind of praxis. I don't agree with a lot of that praxis, but a lot of it I do. We feed unsheltered and food insecure people. We do education and outreach on Marxism. We organize labor unions. We lobby and push for marginal victories within the bourgeois legislature. I don't believe that any of those small victories are revolutionary, but they are small marginal steps that improve people's lives in the short term. Things that have real effects on the lives of working class people. The CPUSA gives me a platform, and the logistical and financial support of the greater party to pursue what praxis I can find common ground on with the main stream dem-socs and soc-dems in the greater party. I'd rather feed the hungry next to a dem-soc than argue about whether or not the Soviet Union was actually socialist on an online forum (not that I'm not happy to do that too). \n\n2. The democratic structures within the party in my district are controlled by Marxist-Leninists. We are working hard to reclaim our communist party. We recognize that the party has been gutted by liberals, and deprived of it's revolutionary spirit. This is unacceptable to us. The CPUSA has historically been *the* party of the proletariat in America. It is not anymore. We seek to reclaim that, and restore it to the vanguard party it was always meant to be. We can only do that by being members, and electing MLs to leadership positions. We have made some strides, such as reclaiming my district, but we have a long way to go.\n\n3. Being a party member gives me the platform to do ML outreach. Being officially associated with a political party has given me access to do education and outreach on my college campus. I can set up a table on campus and educate students on what Marxist-Leninism truly is. Not Marxism as the greater CPUSA sees it, but revolutionary Marxist-Leninism as it was intended to be. This is incredibly valuable to me, and I wouldn't have the opportunity to do it on my own.\n\nSo yes, the party is incredibly flawed, but it's worth fighting for. It's *our* party. Not the FBI's, not the liberal's, not the bourgeoisie's, but ours. Let's take it back. \n\nI'd be happy to answer any specific questions any of you have about the party.

Him and his administration are significantly more liberal and less fascist\/colonial than the norm for the South Korean puppet government, and the US didn't have any time to replace them before the DPRK got nukes. The US ratcheted up tensions over the DPRK finalising nuclear weapons testing, and South Korea was pretty much not being heard at all, but evidently they've pulled off a pretty substantial diplomatic coup in being able to pull away from American influence and go along with DPRK calls for peace. The US has very little option now, especially if the DPRK can negotiate to a peace, because the US would lose a lot of face internationally if they refused to make peace when South Korea does, and would find it much, much harder to go to war against Korea.

Here's the party's official stance on it \\- \n\n[http:\/\/www.cpusa.org\/party\\_info\/socialism\\-in\\-the\\-usa\/](http:\/\/www.cpusa.org\/party_info\/socialism-in-the-usa\/)\n\n* Is it as revisionist as it sounds?\n\nYes, the current party platform is very revisionist, but the platform of the party changes regularly, as new leadership is elected. \n\n* How would you characterise the CPUSA's current leadership in terms of ideology?\n\nDemocratic Socialist, in line with what the DSA stands for. There is also a mix of Social Democratic ideals that are thrown around, but all in all the party does support a platform that is Marxist in nature, although as I said above, it is very revisionist, and reformist as opposed to revolutionary. \n\n* I read somewhere that the CPUSA no longer practices democratic centralism, how does the party function then?\n\nHere is the most current constitution of the CPUSA, adopted in 2014.

At this level, local party members will meet at regular intervals, determined by them, to decide on the direction that they want to take. This is where they will decide on, and organize direct actions. Higher levels of leadership, such as district, and national committees are very hands off with clubs for the most part. There are a few exceptions, such as in the larger districts like NYC, but for the most part the clubs get left alone. In my case actually, I'm the only member in my city. It's rather small. Therefor, I have no club, but I can still function on my own, with the authority of the party behind me. This has allowed me to take actions on my own, and with other non party\\-affiliated comrades in my community. I typically only communicate with the district level leaderships when I want something from them, not the other way around.

{"author":"theborderhopper1","body":"Well, if you're up to date on US politics, you'll know that the ruling bourgeoisie has used the illusion of a 2\\-party system to present a \"choice\" to people, and present their regime as a democracy based around the concepts of the popular opinion winning.  Establishment defenders of this system will often argue that 3rd alternatives should join one of the two parties and drag that party closer to their ideology.  The surface level argument for them is that the most popular idea should win out, and democracy should be served.\n\nThe reality in practice is quite different as we've watched the last few years of the \"progressive wing\" or the \"Bernie wing\" as they're called, attempting to field candidates in the Democrat party, trying to alter the party platform, and \"drag the party to the left\".  They're for things as \"Radical\" like universal government\\-run healthcare, and they're opposed by the establishment \"Business\\-friendly Democrats\".  Aka. The Bourgeoisie.   So when the official story is that the party itself is to be neutral to candidates, and the party's primary voters decide who should run representing the party, this is a story that shows that all is a load of BS.\n\nThis story is centered around a \"Bernie Democrat\", running against a \"Business\\-Friendly Democrat\".  The Democratic Party pre\\-ordained the \"Business\\-Friendly Democrat\" as their chosen \"more electable\" candidate, and regardless of the popular opinion of party primary voters, they are doing everything they can to violate the party neutrality and back the \"Business\\-Friendly Democrat\".  The \"Bernie Democrat\" decided to record a call, that is all too familiar with other \"Bernie Democrats\" across the country.  It was a call with the Democratic Party leadership telling him not to run, to intimidate him, and tell him that they will be doing everything to work against him.  This article in particular is about Nancy Pelosi, a main establishment Democrat, doing damage control after the news broke showcasing their corruption.\n\nAs an American Marxist, I see this as the day to day, year to year, status quo of my government and is the textbook example of what Marx describes as the \"dictatorship of the Bourgeoisie\".  Its where democracy only really matters when its in the interests of the Bourgeoisie.  When that doesn't work for them, any other means of control should be used.  Its the behind the scenes control mechanisms in place to ensure that the US government is owned by corporations, and the ruling class is maintained.   Its when the practical outcomes of such a system rule in favor exclusively in favor of the rich.   Its a system where 91&amp;#37; of those win elections have the most money \"donated\" to them, a system where money literally rules.  Its the antithesis to the Dictatorship of the Proletariat.\n\nUnfortunately, in America, we were never educated in the basics of Marxism.  So when the working class, fighting for something as basic as public healthcare, sees this Bourgeoisie control mechanism in action, its genuinely shocked even when this is business as usual.  Little do American progressives realize, that Marx diagnosed this exact problem centuries ago in his writings.\n\nTLDR:  Rich people own the US.

{"author":"IAmTheRedScare","body":" I'm happy to have this conversation in public, just in case some lurkers are also interested. I suppose your first step would be to seek out leftists that may not be affiliated with any organization. Depending on how small your town is, there may be at least a handful of other leftists who aren't very visible. Look out for events that may not be politically leftist in nature, but could draw in leftists. For example, my town had a conference come through called \"Opening space for the radical imagination\". It wasn't an explicitly political conference, but in practice it ended up being a group of anarchists, socialists, and soc\\-dems coming together to talk about contemporary issues from a leftist perspective. I met and took the information of a few comrades that I met there, who weren't involved in any organization, or direct actions. \n\nIf you can't find any events that look like they may draw in leftists, you could just go out canvasing. It takes a lot of confidence, and you may want to have an organization's name to throw out that you're a part of, if anyone asks, but it's a good way to find\/make comrades. Just go door to door, or stop people on the sidewalk with a clipboard or binder full of leftist literature, and ask people if they want to learn more about Marxism, or Communism. You can buy a box of Communist Manifestos off Amazon for like $1 each. Hand em out. It's a good way to not only meet any isolated comrades in your town, but also make new ones by potentially radicalizing liberals. This is something I do pretty often.\n\nOnce you do meet comrades, build a network. You don't have to make yourselves into an official organization, it could just be a group of 2 or 3 comrades who share common ideological ground. Then you can start planning direct actions. 2 or 3 comrades can effectively accomplish a lot of things. You can go out canvasing, or hold an education event. You can learn about organizing labor, and go offer your assistance to any small town workplaces looking to unionize. You could lobby your city council for worker friendly legislation. You could train and arm workers and marginalized minorities in firearm safety, and how to defend themselves, and help them to obtain legal concealed carry permits. Small towns are great places for organizing, because just 1 or 2 comrades can have a big impact on the local political climate. ","created_utc":1524932585,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

Liberals use \"but m'300million!!!\" Which undermines class struggle in a \"rolling over\" fashion like they're the lapdog of the bourgeoisie. \n\n**The trick is: do what LSC does.** Say what you will about that sub, it's done a lot of good in spreading class consciousness in meme format. You don't have to play defense in your propaganda, you need to play offense. You need to say \"Look at the fucked up shit *capitalism is doing*,\" and don't get caught up in trying to defend previous socialist states because liberals have designed the narrative in which it just makes you look like a holocaust denier, so in the case of propaganda, just dismiss it; it's irrelevant to most peoples' lives anyway. \n\nWhat you do is:\n\nNever play defense in your propaganda. It's your propaganda, it's a weapon you're creating *against liberalism and its toxic sister, fascism*. Don't blunt your sword in an attempt to make it a shield. Marx's criticisms of capitalism are legitimate criticisms that will not be invalidated until capitalism is finished. \n\nIdentify your allies and your enemies in your propaganda.

{"author":"AccolyteNinja","body":"Hey guys, u\/AccolyteNinja here. I want to thank OP u\/trook2 for asking a question I asked myself ever since becoming a socialist over a year ago. Here's my 2 cents on the topic, it's going to be a long read, please bear with it:\n\n\nLike how Lenin adapted and applied Marxism to the Russian situation and Mao adapted and applied Marxism to the Chinese situation and brought about revolution in those nations, we here in America need to do the same here: adapt and apply Marxism to the American situation.\n\nWe need to ask ourselves: What obstacles do we face bringing communism to the USA? What I see:\n- Long-standing tradition of anti socialist propaganda.\n- \"Communism\" is a taboo word.\n- A 1 party neo-liberal government (2 bourgeoisie parties controlling everything = literally 1 party).\n- A bourgeoisie police state.\n- A inverted totalitarian corporate run economy.\n- An increasingly less educated population.\n\nOkay, so now we ask ourselves: What conditions do we have that can help bring about Marxism?\n- An increasingly impoverished and angry population.\n- A population believing the propaganda less and less.\n- A population willing to stand up to the mercenary armies (police).\n- A population increasingly wary of corporations and the government.\n- A population experienced in dealing in black markets.\n- A population that loves the idea of unionization.\n- A population that is experienced in social media. Hell, my parents can't figure out their TV but spend half the day on social media.\n- Guns. Lots of guns. Guns as far as the eye can see.\n\nSo what does this mean for Marxism in America?\nIn short, we have a population emotionally ready for revolution, but no ideology to unite behind and ultimately fragmented. And that is the problem that we, as socialists, communists, and marxists have here in America: They love what we stand for, our policies and the egalitarianism it brings, but they hate our name. I repeat that:\n\nTHEY LOVE WHAT WE STAND FOR, BUT THEY HATE OUR NAME.\n\n\nSo then, what do we do? What can be done? I have a few ideas:\n\n1. Organize. We connect with other communists in our area, perhaps with socialists and social democrats, even with those willing to walk under a \"labor\" banner. I know right, soc-dems? We need to recognize that we are not alone in this struggle, and that this is not about us per se. We are not in this to be martyrs, we are not in this for glory. We are in this for the people. Therefore we organize amongst our selves as a communist party, a revolutionary party. Then we reach out to others and form a coalition of the united front. I don't believe we have the numbers to bring Marxism to the forefront in America, but through democratic method and bringing about right policy through a worker-led coalition.\nSo... Organize into parties as communists &amp; socialists. (I'm thinking regional parties) Organize different parties into a singular united front coalition.\n\n2. Educate. While the American people as a whole are being increasingly less educated, we need to remind them (also to remember ourselves) that their issues are due to the system they live in, and to a bourgeoisie oligarchy. We need to constantly be agitating. We also need to spread news on the evils of the system, the elite, and of capitalism. We need to teach that capitalism is not synonymous with democracy. We just need to use language they will understand. No one will understand \"Dictatorship of the Proletariat\" but it's easier to understand \"a government of the people, by the people, and for the people\".\n\n3. Collectivize. As Marxists we need to push socialist policies and argue for them constantly. Universal healthcare, universal college, nationalized banking, amongst other popular truly egalitarian policies should be things we push. Tenants unions, workers' unions, general unions, collectives, and co-operatives should also be proposed and organised as opposed to the traditional capitalist - worker employment agreement. The more democratic our workplaces are the more power we take away from the capitalists and the more we educate the population through democratic practice.\n\n4. Develop. We know that as Marxists we need to read up on the classics but it is not enough. Individually we need to develop ourselves mentally, physically, and ideologically. We need to make ourselves fit (to fight in the coming revolution, remember a fascist worked out today). We need to learn a craft to provide a need with a solution within our industry. We also need to put our knowledge into practice by actually organizing and debating. Theory is not enough. We must build our knowledge through study and build experience through application but either is useless without focus which is built through discipline. We must be better.\n\n5. Faith. Through it all, through the struggle, through the propaganda, through the doubts and self-doubts, through the pain and suffering, we need to have faith in 2 things always: ourselves and the people. Without faith in ourselves we curse ourselves with hesitation and do nothing. Without our faith in the masses we slip into fascism and invite corruption into our organizations. Look into the myth of the \"Foolish old man who moved the mountain\" for the kind of faith I'm talking about.\n\n\nThis one actually took me all day to write, and I can really spend several days on each individual idea but this is what I felt I needed to put down here for this post, since I've been obsessed with this question even before OP put this up here.\n\n\nIf any on here reside in Orange County, please PM me. I'd seriously wanna link up and organize. I'm tired of being the only communist here.\n\nUpdate: Edit format.","created_utc":1524984867,"score":9,"subreddit":"communism"}

In other words, the results of a oppressing people based on arbitrary differences has real consequences, and those consequences need to be addressed alongside the system that made it possible for them to be put in that position in the first place.

I'll quote something from an anarchist YouTube video I saw that references the anarchist historian Lucien van der Walt.\n\n&gt; The ruling class is composed of two groups.  Economic elites, who own or control the means of production through private state companies.... and political elites, who own or control the means of administration and coercion, such as generals, politicians, ministers, and high ranking civil servants.\n\nThis is complete nonsense that falls apart when subjected to any kind of real world analysis or scrutiny.  \"Political elites,\" or officeholders, don't have any power other than that which they derive from the class that controls a country.  Let's compare and contrast the United States and Cuba on this question.\n\nDoes Donald Trump go from one group to another when he is elected President of the United States?  How about the members of his Cabinet and inner circle who are all literal capitalists\/economic elites, such as Gary Cohn, Steve Bannon, Steven Mnuchin, Rex Tillerson, Betsy DeVos, etc. etc.  These individuals do not take on a different class character when they are elected or appointed to political office.
