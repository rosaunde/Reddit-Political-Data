{"author":"ParabolicTrajectory","body":"Okay. After reading your post, there are a few things I want to touch on. Like /u/corvibae said, you're not exactly wrong about a lot of this, but I'm.... bothered by some of it.\n\nFirst, you took three long paragraphs to say what comes across as \"we need to let \"normal-looking\" straight white men take the lead.\" As a communist, I'm sure you understand why that's... not cool. For one thing, that's a regressive dynamic, and implicitly upholds the oppressive structures we work to destroy. But more importantly, communism speaks the loudest to the oppressed, and has the most to offer them - that's POC, the LGBT community, and women, not just working-class white men.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point. In that long post, you didn't mention women in the movement, or feminist causes, even once. Patriarchy and capitalism are inextricably linked, therefore communist causes are feminist. I'd like to believe this was just an oversight on your part, but it's a glaring one, especially considering your major issue with our \"image\" and how we \"alienate white men.\" I can't help but see parallels between your comments about our \"anarkiddy\" appearance, and the way gender non-conforming leftist women present themselves. And it makes me wonder why you didn't mention that at all, because \"angry marxfems need to wear makeup and be nicer to men\" seems like the obvious next step in your argument... but you didn't make it. Why?\n\nHowever, that brings me to my point about the \"anarkiddy\" look. After the Cold War, both fascism and communism survived through subcultures, especially punk/metal scenes. That is where that look comes from, and that influence continues today. You have a point here - the fascists largely did away with the \"punk skinhead\" look to legitimize themselves, and it worked. With the decreasing influence of punk/metal subcultures in general, that aesthetic no longer appeals to many working-class young people, and may alienate some of them. So you're not wrong by saying \"just dress like a normal person.\" But that doesn't mean \"wear suits and ties,\" either. /u/corvibae covered that better than I can.\n\nUltimately, I want to bring this back around to your insistence on letting \"normal-looking\" white men take the lead. \n\nYou almost had a point about fetishizing POC and LGBT communities, in that we often give lip service to amplifying their voices and their importance in the movement, but our actions rarely back that up. However, that doesn't seem to be your point at all. Your point really seems to be \"we need to let straight white men take the lead, to appeal to other straight white men.\" No, we absolutely do not need to do that, nor should we. The oppressed do not need to suck up to our oppressors. Change does not come from above. White men who feel alienated by critiques of white supremacy, male supremacy, and homophobia are not welcome in our movement. We should not compromise our principles to appeal to them.","created_utc":1514765546,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

The Black Panthers were well known for wearing the Panther uniform. The beret, leather jacket, and blue-jeans look was specifically designed to set them apart from everyone else. I'm a historian who has studied the history of black politics, including the Panthers, extensively. They weren't trying to dress casually. They were trying to wear a uniform that would get people to pay attention. They were a paramilitary organization and wanted the most casual military uniform that everyone could get a hold of.

The treatment of women by men in our society isn't just a problem that will resolve itself with revolution. It will involve(in my admittedly white straight man opinion), a class struggle between women(the oppressed class) and men(the oppressor class). For Lenin and Mao, women's rights were important, and while the treatment of women and feminist activists in the Soviet Union and the PRC wasn't precisely stellar, the rise in literacy rates did lead to politically and culturally literate women in both countries and their societies. \n","created_utc":1514768392,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

Thank you.\n\n&gt;The reason I brought up our hatred towards whites is because it alienates a huge portion of the working class and it serves as a recruiting tool from fascists. It should be clear that Fascism's largest recruiting pool is white males.\n\nHere, you are absolutely right. And you do make a fair point, that the alienation white men feel pushes them into the arms of the fascists. You are not wrong there. \n\n&gt; It should be clear that Fascism's largest recruiting pool is white males, so we have to compete in this area.\n\nThis is where most communists aren't going to agree. We don't have to compete there. We should not tone down our criticism of white male supremacy to make white men more comfortable with our movement. That is, put simply, selling out. White men who identify more with their whiteness and their maleness than as members of the working class are not comrades. The way to reach them is to make them identify with the working class, but we seem to agree there, at least. \n\n&gt;Amplifying the voice of minorities and recruiting white people isn't mutually exclusive\n\nIn theory, they shouldn't be. In practice, they are. Confronting white supremacy makes white people uncomfortable (I say that as a white person). Amplifying the voices of POC inherently confronts white supremacy, even if they aren't discussing white supremacy and the oppression they face as POC. But there's the rub - you can't simultaneously say we should amplify the voices of POC and tone down our critiques of white supremacy, because the latter contradicts the former. You'd essentially be asking POC to stop talking about their experience with white supremacy. \n\n&gt;I respect your position as feminist first, but I think this is a fundamental mistake with many Marxists. As you yourself have said, \"Patriarchy and capitalism are inextricably linked,\" but the thing is that capitalism causes patriarchy, which is why we have to remove the capitalist system before we can destroy the patriarchy. Choosing communism second is an issue, because you cannot solve patriarchy without bringing the whole system to crash.\n\nFrankly, I think your point of view here is a common mistake among male leftists. Capitalism does not CAUSE patriarchy. The two are linked; they feed each other, they prop each other up. Capitalism most likely could not exist without patriarchy (the unpaid/undervalued labor of women, such as housework and raising children/workers is crucial to its existence), but patriarchy can and does exist without capitalism. Patriarchy predates capitalism, after all. Mao's China is a perfect example here. The status of women saw great strides - the end of foot binding and concubinage, rising literacy rates, decreased TFR - but you can't say Mao's China *wasn't* a patriarchal society. Same goes for the USSR, Cuba, pretty much all examples of communist states.\n\nAnd the same can be said for issues like racism and homophobia. The end of capitalism won't be the end of other forms of oppression - these require constant, concerted effort in addition to our work to liberate the working class. In my opinion, communists' insistence that capitalism is the Final Boss of oppression, therefore all other forms can take a backseat, is what drives people to become anarchists. \n\nAnd the same can be said for other forms of oppression, like racism and homophobia, to answer your point here:\n\nMy point is that workers rights should come above all else, which serves to recruit from all segments of society as class transcends through all races and genders, and use our stances on other issues to recruit minorities.\n\nand here:\n\n&gt;racial and gender issues are perpetuated by the system of capitalism. So we have to work to destroy capitalism. Because leftists place too heavy an emphasis on these side issues, we are just letting the issues happen and not striving to actually solve them.\n\nI should also point out that, by placing a high priority on these issues, we are explicitly stating that communist organizations are welcoming to marginalized populations. Speaking from plenty of experience here, the fact that the left *doesn't* prioritize feminism and women's issues drives a *lot* of women away from communist organizations and communist activism. That's how you get libfems.\n\nThe thing is, refusing to prioritize these issues sends the message that we aren't welcome here. That our personal struggles aren't a priority. That our voices won't matter. That microaggressions against us will be tolerated even within the organization, and macroaggressions won't be addressed by the organization. I'm saying this as a \"feminism first\" white women who was drawn to anarchism/anarcho-feminism at first for this exact reason. And frankly, sexism on the left is a constant battle. I deal with it because I value organized action - but I shouldn't have to deal with it. And many people won't bother. \n\nMy point being, we shouldn't be worried about alienating white men with our focus on POC and LGBT issues - because not focusing on those issues alienates POC and LGBT people. You're going to alienate someone here. You can silence marginalized populations to make The Average Joe more comfortable, or you can tell him to get over it and give these people a voice.\n\n&gt;It does serve as a recruiting tool, but that is what we should exclusively use it as (as well as actually helping these people out under the confines of capitalism to successfully bring them on board, but again, mainly a recruiting tool)\n\nAnd this is where you lose me.

A regular public health network is in service throughout the country and dental, ophthalmic and other medical services have reached the world\u2019s advanced level. Pharmaceutical industry also saw steady growth to satisfy the needs of medicines with domestic production.\n\nAs the government pays growing attention to the upbringing of children, they enjoy state benefits before they are born.\n\nSugar and mining industries, fisheries and other economic sectors made rapid growth compared to that before the revolution and bioengineering, gene engineering and other fields of science and technology also made innovative achievements.\n\nCuba, which was rife with ignorance and illiteracy, poverty and backwardness in the past, could bring about a great change as its people chose socialism.\n\nThe US and other hostile forces did not like it and persistently pursued vicious moves against Cuba including plots to overthrow its government, armed attack and all kinds of sanctions over the past several decades.\n\nHowever, they have been confronted with a strong rejection and criticism of the international community.\n\nAs an example, a resolution which urges the US to lift anti-Cuban blockade was adopted for the 26th time at the UN General Assembly in early November last year with an approval of 191 UN member states except the US and Israel.\n\nCuba has enhanced its international status as it advances holding fast to the cause of socialism and justice.\n\nIt boosts cooperation with regional countries within the framework of the Community of Latin-American and Caribbean States and other regional organizations and gives priority to improving relations with non-aligned countries.\n\nLast year saw a boost in the traditional bilateral friendship between the DPRK and Cuba. Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un sent a basket of flowers to the Cuban embassy in Pyongyang and the DPRK government delegation visited Havana to mark the first year after the death of Fidel Castro Ruz, leader of the Cuban revolution.\n\nThe DPRK pays particular attention to bolstering up relations with Cuba and voices full support and solidarity with the cause of socialism of the Cuban people.\n\n \n\nBy Han Jong Chol PT","created_utc":1514868309,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"DIOS_INJUSTO","body":"The language comes from the translations to the \"General Political Line of the Communist party of Peru.\"  I assume the translation was faithful to the original Spanish and/or Quechua.  In the introduction to the section titled *[Line Of Construction Of the Three Instruments of Revolution](https://gplpcp.wordpress.com/line-of-construction-of-the-three-instruments-of-the-revolution/)* the party document states clearly,\n\n&gt;[T]he Party is the highest form of organization, the army is the principal form of organization and the Front is the third instrument, and these three instruments are to seize Power by means of revolutionary violence. \n\nThe outright importance of the army over the united front, and the primacy of militarization in general is also reflected further in this document with the discussion around the militarization of the Party:\n\n&gt;Chairman Gonzalo expounds the militarization of the Communist Parties and the concentric construction of the three instruments. The militarization of the Communist Parties is the political directive with a strategic content, since it is \u201cthe set of transformations, changes and readjustments it needs to lead the People\u2019s War as the principal form of struggle that will generate the new State.\u201d Therefore, the militarization of the Communist Parties is key for the democratic revolution, the socialist revolution and the cultural revolutions.\n\nThis section then goes on to describe the general line on how the Party, Army, and State will be formed.  The conception of State creation is linked to the united front in this document, and similar to how the Party and Army are given privileged titles relative to the Front (Highest and Primary vs. Third), the subordinate relationship the state holds relative to the Party and Army is rehashed in this section:\n\n&gt;Always keep in mind the system of Support Bases, of guerrilla zones, of zones of operations and points of actions, because those constitute the environment in which the new State develops and are key to maintaining the strategic course; within this environment the People\u2019s Guerrilla Army, under the leadership of the Party, moves as its spinal column.\n\nand\n\n&gt;He [Gonzalo] establishes that the People\u2019s Committees are materializations of the new State. They are Committees of the United Front; led by Commissars who assume their State functions by commissioning, elected by the Assemblies of Representatives and subject to recall. They are, up to now, clandestine; they march forward with Commissions, led by the Party applying the rule of the \u201cthree thirds\u201d: One third of them are Communists, one third are peasants and one third are progressives, and are sustained by the Army.\n\nThere is obviously a hierarchy of importance the PCP sees in the three weapons, that being:\n\n1. The Party is the highest body, the leading body.\n2. The Army is the primary body, that which the bulk of the party's efforts go into organizing.\n3. The United Front is needed for establishing a new state.\n\nMy problem with this, and what I believe to be one of the errors of what can be called 'Gonzaloism' or, probably more appropriately, Gonzalo Thought, is this rigid hierarchy of importance between the three weapons.  The document does state quite clearly that the three weapons must be developed together, but does not make any mention about the leading roles that each must play in particular circumstances.  I feel this was further reflected in accounts about the way PW was conducted accordance with the PCP's general military strategy of surrounding and annihilating enemies.  If we take the level of importance  of the united front (or lack thereof) that the PCP was consolidating cadre under, it becomes easier to understand how cells were led to killing perceived political opponents in the rural areas as opposed to finding ways to unite with these forces to build stronger bases.\n\nAs for specific instances where the Party was under the command of the gun and not the other way around, while Gonzalo was still free I do not think this inversion happened, however the general line on militarizing the party coupled with the PCP's Jefatura line set the party up to splinter upon his capture, with some cells falling prey to this inversion.  But that is beside the point I am making. \n\nIf you disagree with the above interpretation I am all ears to hear an alternative.","created_utc":1514930934,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"1krix2krix","body":"For those who avoid Facebook, here is the text of the post (it's too long for one comment, so it's continued in a reply to this comment):\n\n* * * \n\n\"2018: A NEW YEAR, A NEW US. \nThe organization formerly known as \"RATPAC\" is now the STONEWALL MILITANT FRONT. \n\nWe have consolidated our basic understanding of patriarchy under capitalism and its relationship to women and LGBT people. This task was taken up to rid our politics of liberalism and postmodernism, and to uphold proletarian feminism over identity politics. Because of this, we will no longer be organizing exclusively along trans identity lines but rather based on our political understanding of the secondary aspect of patriarchy under capitalism (defined below). This is not merely a broadening of our membership, but the sharpening of our politics to be more capable of fighting our oppression and waging revolution. It is the product of years of studying, working, and fighting. \n\nThis theoretical understanding is roughly summarized below. A more thorough and precise theoretical document on this will come in time. The name of our page will change in the near future. \n\nRATPAC MAKES WAY FOR THE STONEWALL MILITANT FRONT\n\nRATPAC started in March of 2015 with little more than a handful of members and a desire to see the end to the oppression of trans people. We lacked any kind of consolidated views as to how accomplish this or what this even really meant, but we did agree on one thing: capitalism is the enemy of the broad exploited majority of trans people and it has to be destroyed. We have faced many defeats as well as successes over the course of these last few years, we have struggled hard, at times just to stay afloat, and we have grown in numbers and political precision. We have broken with many incorrect ideas and taken many steps forward as an organization; we have rejected and drawn hard lines against the liberalism of nonprofits, NGOs, and the like - and we have accepted the necessity for militancy and discipline in our fight. The next important step forward for us is to make a clear demarcation between ourselves as a true revolutionary organization and those whose politics would offer everyday trans people anything but power. \n\nPostmodernism lacks the ability to understand that there is a contradiction fundamental to the function of our society between the working class and the ruling class, that everything we do as people living in this society will be in favor of one class or the other, and that this conflict is the main driving force of capitalism. All iterations of oppression, such as white supremacy and patriarchy, are meant to serve the ruling class and uphold the current distribution of power. Instead postmodernism seeks to endlessly divide people and \u201crealities\u201d based on their identities. It rejects the idea of objective truths that can and must be deeply investigated and understood independently from our individual fancies, and it leaves people only to see their own \u201clived experiences\u201d as the truth. Identity politics (or what can be called identity opportunism or identity-reductionism) is a direct product of this political postmodernism, and must be done away with. These politics seek to center \u201cvoices\u201d on the basis of identity rather than centering a political line capable of taking on the objective conditions we are facing, substituting individual identities and experiences for politics. \n\nWith this has arisen the lingo of \u201cunraveling\u201d or \u201cdeconstructing\u201d what is falsely portrayed as separate-but-intersecting systems of oppression through various individual changes we can make to our behaviors and language based on identity. The highest organizational forms of these politics is represented in capitalist-friendly NGOs and non-profits who now freely assume this language of so-called social justice. It has created little else beyond supposedly progressive careers and \u201chot take\u201d writing gigs, and an ego-drive subculture that finds its home on the internet and on university campuses. The people who fervently uphold these politics are often recognizable by their ability to call damn near anything revolutionary. This comes easy to them since their politics actually represent the liquidation of revolution. \n\nWe stand prepared to draw a line in the sand and arm ourselves against the right and the idealist liberals alike. Without a truly materialist viewpoint, we will absolutely fail. Political postmodernism is the ideological output of the petit-bourgeoisie who have no concrete relationship to the production of the world around them, and so their politics follow suit. We do not have such a luxury. We must recognize our place in this bigger picture if we really want to see a change and that requires a thorough analysis of what LGBT oppression is, how it manifests, and who is affected by it. We see this as distinct from the way that any postmodern, liberal organization orients itself in two ways: first, we reject the idea that bad individuals and microaggressions are the source of oppression, we understand the relationship of LGBT oppression to capitalism, and second we wholy reject identity politics and see this as a hopeless way to organize. We understand that while our identities can inform our worldview, our \u201clived experiences\u201d are subordinate to class oppression and this must be taken into account in our organizing. The only way we can effectively destroy the oppression that is facing LGBT people is by truly understanding it as it actually exists as part of the machinery of the whole of capitalist society. Anything else is political betrayal of trans people. \n\nWith these truths in mind, we have approached the task of consolidating our general political understanding of patriarchy under capitalism, how it relates to women and LGBT people, and how its conclusions must inform our new organizational form and direction. \n\nTHE PURPOSE OF PATRIARCHY\n\nThe purpose of patriarchy under capitalism is to uphold a particular set of labor relations that serve the capitalist class, maintaining and reproducing the capitalist system as a whole. \n\nThe cornerstone of patriarchal relations under any class system has been the division of productive and reproductive labor. In modes of production before capitalism, this was strictly for the accomplishment of reproductive tasks: ensuring each new generation is born and successfully raised to replace the previous generation, and maintaining the health and \"general upkeep\" of all economic participants.\n\nIn the era of capitalism, and especially imperialism, the demands of capital have brought women into the workforce and there now exists waged reproductive labor and women engaging in productive labor as well. In this context, patriarchy has arisen for a second task: to create a special, extra-oppressed section of the workforce that can be more deeply exploited, often only being seen as suitable for some of the most disrespected and poorly paid tasks, while ensuring that the original reproductive tasks are still being broadly accomplished. \n\nThe assignment of gender (male/female) at birth in its most modern form arose from the division of productive/reproductive labor and the subjugation of reproductive labor. It is the means by which humans are set up in preparation for them to assume fundamental economic and social positions to serve capitalism, both in outside-of-the-home life, as well as in life within the economic unit of the nuclear family.\n\nTHE PRINCIPAL ASPECT OF PATRIARCHY UNDER CAPITALISM\n\nThe principal aspect of patriarchal oppression is of women as a social role. This is not based on an individual\u2019s genitals nor their personally held identity, but is being constantly determined and acted upon by their existence under capitalism. Given that we understand what the purpose of male/female gender assignment is in capitalist society, we can know that this oppression faces anyone who is socially perceived to have been assigned female at birth (AFAB). \n\nThe ongoing social scrutiny of and action upon those perceived to be AFAB is the way by which society continues, even after birth, to assign gender. Perception of being AFAB and thus being continually assigned \u201cfemale\u201d becomes the basis by which capitalist society sees one as capable of, and thus required to, uphold its \u201cfemale-assigned\u201d aspect of the division of labor, and all of this division\u2019s generated ideas and expectations about women that come with it: to carry forward reproductive tasks and certain \u201cacceptable\u201d labor positions generally, to hold a particular position within a nuclear family, and to assume certain social (and sexual) roles. \n\nConcisely, we know that male/female gender assignment came from the division of productive and reproductive labor, and that with these came a whole host of particular roles and ways of being treated that accompany each of these assignments. We know that this is to fulfill certain economic tasks and a particular labor relationship, and to reproduce these in capitalist society again and again. It is people who are socially perceived as AFAB (and thus are again and again being primarily \u201cassigned female\u201d) that are the primary subjects to the principal aspect of patriarchal oppression under capitalism.\n\nIn this understanding, this means that not all AFAB people spend their lives as the primary subject of the principal aspect of patriarchy. It also means that not all people who are the primary subject of the principal aspect of patriarchy are AFAB. Not all women face this principal aspect of patriarchy, and not all who face this aspect are women. It is neither genitals nor identity that determines one living as the primary subject to the principal aspect of patriarchy, but social existence under capitalism.

{"author":"1krix2krix","body":"THE SECONDARY ASPECT OF PATRIARCHY\n\nThe secondary aspect of patriarchal oppression is what we might call the oppression of deviation from the codified assigned roles corresponding to perceived gender assignment. This, too, is meant to uphold a very particular set of social relations that correspond to the relations of production (the male/female divide and the division of productive and reproductive labor).\n\nWe can picture this deviation in a social context occuring when someone is perceived to have been assigned one gender at birth, but to have in varying degrees and amounts conformed to the social relations and attributes of the gender assignment other to their own. This can be in presentation and mannerism (that acts against the coding of their perceived assigned gender) and in the way that they have sex (if it is perceived to not promote reproduction and the economic unit of the nuclear family). \n\nEvery person typically gets elements of this aspect of patriarchy as a part of gender assignment and socialization/discipline as they are prepared to assume corresponding social and economic roles. However, when we look broadly, we see a landscape in which the primary subject to this secondary aspect of patriarchal oppression is LGBT people. In fact, it is this secondary aspect of patriarchal oppression that makes it possible for us to speak of LGBT with any specificity. However, being neatly identifying or being defined as LGBT is not determinant of who faces this aspect of patriarchy. Again, this is a structure existing independently of identity, and we can only destroy it by understanding it as it exists independently of identity. \n\nThis is the aspect of patriarchy that most oversees the social boundaries between the corresponding roles of the division of labor, and sees such \u201cdeviance\u201d as undermining the ideas, assumptions, inherencies, and \u201ccommon sense\u201d that must continually be reproduced for patriarchy to exist.\n\nFor trans women who are generally read to be assigned male at birth, they may be seen as men who are betraying the collective task of sexually dominating women, shirking their designated roles both socially and economically, or threatening the most vital underpinnings of \"inherent aspects of assigned gender\" that make heterosexual men feel that their way of being and seeing the world (including both themselves and women) is \"natural\". \n\nLesbians may be faced with disdain for being perceived as \"overstepping their boundaries\" as women, and limiting the scope of the competitive marketplace of sexual domination by men. Similarly, butch lesbians can be seen with contempt for how their expression and manner of dress shirks consideration or \"availability\" for sexual consumption by men. \n\nThere are innumerable instances to varying degrees of intensity where we can see LGBT people and even others facing the secondary aspect of patriarchal oppression. And in fact, we can see that within this aspect of patriarchy, what we understand to be the motive force of violence, exploitation, and subjugation of trans people is actually shared ACROSS identity lines. This is because the secondary aspect of patriarchal oppression, just like the principal aspect, is founded in upholding particular economic and corresponding social relations, not in identity or genitalia. \n\nLONG LIVE THE STONEWALL MILITANT FRONT\n\nIn order to act on our newly adopted theoretical understanding of patriarchal oppression and the way it affects LGBT people, we must change the way we organize. The culmination of RATPAC\u2019s work and study has made way for its new and more effective form, from here on out to be known as the Stonewall Militant Front. SMF is an organization based on a shared social consciousness due to a set of common social conditions; we reject organizing on the basis of identity and seek to shed the dead weight of liberalism in addressing our task. We instead will seek to unite all who can be united on the most scientific and revolutionary of political lines in addressing the secondary aspect of patriarchy under capitalism. It makes sense that such a project would have been forged by working class trans people, but it makes no sense for it to remain exclusive based on identity lines.\n\nThe name Stonewall Militant Front was very deliberately chosen by our members as one that draws on historical roots and common ties while committing to a militant, revolutionary future. The Stonewall Riots saw LGBT people fight back against the foot soldiers of the capitalist state and the patriarchal oppression they were enforcing. The violently rebellious spirit is emphasized in the word \u201cmilitant\u201d. The memory of Stonewall has been co-opted by liberals, just as liberals have attempted to co-opt the name of revolution. Finally, \u201cfront\" signifies that we wish to go beyond Stonewall. Stonewall was a spontaneous example of the LGBT masses\u2019 fighting spirit and capabilities. We need that spirit and the righteous violence to be organized, disciplined, and with a protracted goal of winning power and destroying capitalism. \n\nThe adoption of this theorization and founding of SMF represents a simultaneous continuity and rupture. We were founded in order to address the patriarchal oppression of trans people under capitalism, and we will continue to do that. We will do it better than ever moving forward. However, the founding of SMF is also a rupture. It is a change in direction, committed to a more correct and effective way of organizing based on concrete reality. It is a rejection of the do-nothing identity reductionism that has plagued the LGBT organizing \u201cscene\" for too long, a refusal to have our rage relegated to nonprofits, \u201cwoke\u201d spaces, or academic discourse alien to the interests of our class. It\u2019s a commitment to truly making revolution and forging a unified militancy that threatens the very foundations of what oppresses us. LONG LIVE THE STONEWALL MILITANT FRONT.\"","created_utc":1514931041,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

Just one example of many. \n\n Everyone who wants to get a 4-year post-secondary education should be able to, but we should also push for other options. \n\nIn short, our problems with higher education all have to do with capitalism.

Hence the focus of communists is primarily to undermine US hegemony and end the exploitation of capitalist imperialism once and for all. You might claim that the Chinese are just trying to replace American imperialism with Chinese imperialism, but I am more optimistic than that and I don't think that's the case.\n\nThe relatively better standards of living that are found in the United States and Europe are due to the super-profits coming from imperialism and neocolonialism. The exploitation of the workers has been exported out of the core imperial countries to the Global South, and China is one example of that. The exploitation of the Global South is what allows for the First World living standards.\n\nI think the Chinese communist strategy is play ball with imperialistic exploitation for now, acquire more and more of the means of production from the West using the mechanisms of capitalism itself, and then overthrow the system of imperialist capitalism once they have the power to do so.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong though, just my two cents.","created_utc":1515124618,"score":10,"subreddit":"communism"}

They also manged to have the fastest industrial revolutions in history, and had immense economic growth. \n\n&gt;Under Stalin productivity never exceeded 1913 levels\n\nWhere are you getting this idea from? During the first 5 year plan there was a massive increase in labor into the industrial sector which could partially help explain it's massive growth but this doesn't take into account the massive growth in agricultural production that occurred after the 5 year plans began (massive amounts of people were moved from agriculture to industry, so without an increase in productivity this would be impossible). Also how does this explain continuing growth after the initial influx of labor into the industrial sector? Saying there was no growth in worker productivity is ridiculous considering the massive advances the Soviet Union achieved.\n\n&gt;And what the kulaks hoarded grain? So that's an perfect reason to murder them and their families?\n\nHoarding grain lead to food shortages which is obviously a pretty big issue, and I'm pretty sure you wouldn't be ok with food shortages and potential famine just so some kulaks can continue gaining profit. Also the Soviet government did try to negotiate with them and offer to buy their grain at a reasonable price, they refused and then completely resisted the collectivization (which also wasn't forced by the way, peasants were given a choice to join a collective farm) that came shortly after. This resistance was also in the form of rebelling against the government as well as burning grain, slaughtering live stock, etc. they brought upon the Soviet government's wraith themselves and they definitively weren't just poor innocent farmers being oppressed (the Soviets also didn't go around slaughtering their families, or at least I haven't seen any repeatable source say this).  \n\n&gt; Not only that but the Soviets intentionally orchestrated famines in places like Ukraine.\n\nNot even modern bourgeois historians agree with that, and there is no evidence to show that the Soviet government orchestrated any famines (why the hell would they anyway?). \n\n&gt;The fact remains that the Soviet union was the most murderous and tyrannical in modern history apart from maybe Mao's China.\n\nLol why am I even taking you seriously, you obviously just came to this sub to troll communists. \n","created_utc":1515125475,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

They did add that \"all farmers who benefited under the agrarian reforms programme are allowed to enter into partnerships with partners of their choice whether black or white.\" I'm not sure we should trust their pronouncements in this matter.\n\nAs for the subject in the article posted by the OP, the party newspaper, The Herald, [described it](http://www.herald.co.zw/parastatal-reforms-kick-off-all-state-enterprises-under-evaluation-initiative-part-of-eds-100-day-target/) as the \"evaluating State-owned enterprises (SOEs) under their purview as part of an exercise to identify firms that can either be retained or disposed of\" adding that\n\n&gt; Parastatals, including companies under their portfolio that are beyond redemption, will be shut down.

Some of these things were being done haphazardly, and now line ministries have been directed to identify companies that they want to get rid of and need investors, then we work from that position and **offload these entities**,\u201d he said...the process didn\u2019t entail wholesale disposals, as line ministries would have to come up with information memorandums **stipulating the percentage that could be sold from respective entities.**...\u201cWe are going to sell from one percent to 100 percent shareholding, but there are certain ones (firms) which are of strategic importance to us and **those we cannot sell 100 percent,\u201d** Deputy Minister Mukupe said...In his budget presentation last month, Minister Chinamasa said parastatals that exhibited potential \u201cwill be reformed, while those which cannot be rehabilitated **will be privatised or face outright closure.**\"\n\nThen it goes into claiming the \"inefficiencies\" of state enterprises in Zimbabwe.

{"author":"HysniKapo","body":"The traditional method was to introduce a state monopoly on foreign trade. The Bolsheviks did this as early as 1918, and subsequent socialist countries followed their lead.\n\nTo quote one bourgeois academic (Alexander Baykov, _The Development of the Soviet Economic System_, 1946, pp. 71-73):\n\n&gt;Krasin, who was the actual organizer of the foreign trade monopoly and the first Soviet Ambassador to Great Britain, stressed that: 'Soviet monopoly of foreign trade is simply the application of the general Soviet principle of planned State regulation to the sphere of the foreign trade relations of the Soviet Union. Thus there is the closest mutual connexion between the foreign trade monopoly and the planned economy of the Soviet State. Without a foreign trade monopoly, the Soviet State could not carry out the State planning scheme.' The following advantages can be gained from a State monopoly of foreign trade:\n\n&gt;(a) It affords complete protection against the competition of other countries and against the interference of World Market prices with Internal Market prices. Such protection could not be achieved by mere import duties. To render the protection of import duties effective, it would have been necessary to make the duties almost prohibitive. But very high duties on imports would create great difficulties for exports because the other country on its part will introduce high import duties. A State monopoly of foreign trade makes it possible to conclude agreements with a so-called 'most-favoured nation' clause to make reciprocal concessions in tariffs, because imports could be controlled by internal licences and quotas irrespective of the height of import duties. As a means of protection such duties could have only a secondary importance. They might be used as an additional barrier, applied only in those cases where the specifications attached to import licences were made in general terms, as well as in the case of parcels sent by post and goods carried by travellers.\n\n&gt;Of much greater importance would be import duties which could be used as a means of bargaining when concluding economic agreements with other countries. Soviet economists stressed that 'if we had no tariffs it would be very difficult for us to obtain any concessions from importing countries'.\n\n&gt;(b) A State monopoly of foreign trade makes it possible to regulate imports strictly according to the plan without any formal change in commercial agreements and without any changes in the tariff rates. Import licences are issued by the People's Commissariat of Foreign Trade or its subordinate bodies, according to a general import plan. And, as a matter of fact, import into the Soviet Union, during the later period, was carried out strictly according to plan. In the first period the need for importing certain foodstuffs and other consumer goods made it necessary to concentrate on the import of these items, but later on the import programme was carried out with the aim of supplying capital goods required for the development of industry, transport, and agriculture. The importation of goods for consumption was reduced to a minimum.\n\n&gt;(c) Export, too, could be carried out more strictly according to plan. The State monopoly of foreign trade permitted the Government to determine the general structure of exports and to mobilize more fully the exportable resources of the country, since it was possible to consider export and import as united operations. Under the system of free foreign trade imports and exports usually appear as two separate operations. Importers and exporters work at their own risk, and profits or losses on imports are not compensated by the losses or profits on exports and vice versa. Export is carried out, generally, only with a view to obtaining individual profit and only when the home market cannot offer as profitable conditions for the disposal of the entire quantity of goods as can the foreign market. Only in the case of dumping is export carried out with temporary losses, but even there the ultimate aim is profit.\n\n&gt;A system of State monopoly of foreign trade could treat the question of foreign trade profits in a different way. Both export and import would be viewed not as two commercially separate operations but as two aspects of one operation. The organizations dealing with export and import would be State organizations. Their capital would be part of the State finance, and the losses of one organization could be covered by the profits of the other. The Soviet trading organizations, like any other exporters, were of course anxious to obtain the highest prices for their goods and to buy imported goods \tat the lowest possible prices; but when the level of world prices declined during a crisis the Soviet Union's only concern would be that the prices of articles which she imports should decline more rapidly than the prices of her exports. The result would be that for the same quantity of goods exported the Soviet Union would receive a greater quantity of imports.\n\n&gt;(d) \tA State monopoly of foreign trade rendered it possible to regulate foreign trade not only according to economic aims but also according to political and social ones. The political aims, based on considerations of the desirability or otherwise of developing economic and political relations with a particular country, could be pursued by a corresponding transfer of import purchases from one country to another without formal changes in existing trade agreements with the country concerned.\n\n&gt;(e) \tA State monopoly of foreign trade eliminated the necessity for the internal currency to be linked to the foreign currency. As all foreign trading was done by State organizations a special currency could be used for the accounting of foreign trade operations. This special currency could also be used for conversion into the currency of other countries, for the use of travellers and for remittances between private individuals in their transactions from abroad. And in actual fact, after the Soviet rouble had ceased to appear on the Foreign Exchange markets, the Soviet Government used a special rouble for the calculation of foreign trade and for the purpose of converting foreign currency in private foreign transaction (for travellers and for money orders from abroad) which served only as an accounting unit for all transactions in foreign currency.\n\n&gt;All these advantages of a State monopoly of foreign trade were reasons why the Soviet Government never deviated from this principle. The forms of regulating and executing foreign trade were often changed, but the principle of State monopoly of foreign trade was never infringed.","created_utc":1515288436,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Calabar_king","body":"&gt;When and how did the concept of a Leninist party originate?\n\n1902, when Lenin published *What is to be done?*\n\n&gt;Where does the idea of democratic centralism originate?\n\n*What is to be done?* and *Letter to a comrade*\n\n&gt;What is the benefit of banning factions? What is the benefit of \"no public disagreement with the Party line\"?\n\nYou do not weaken the joint action of the party, nor your image and credibility with the masses, because it does not have a faction determined to constantly and whenever possible undermine the actions of the majority group and discredit the rest of the party in front of the others. Also, opportunist forces are constantly using public disagreement from some comrades with the party line both to criticize and discredit the party and to try to put these comrades even more against their own organization.\n\n&gt;If there is no Leninist vanguard party in a given country, how is one formed?\n\nI suppose every country has its own story to tell. In Brazil the Brazilian Communist Party was formed in 1922 by anarchists who had access to the writings of Marx, Engels and Lenin and agreed with them.\n\n&gt;What is the substantive difference between a 'vanguard party' and a 'mass socialist party'?\n\nIn one word: formation. It is extremely rare for a mass party, especially in very large countries, to offer formation at the level of achieving many cadres. What ends up happening is that this mass is a maneuver to legitimize the dictatorship of leadership. In a cadre party, the concern with formation is much greater and the dialectical relationship between the base and the direction is more efficient and direct because it is a reduced number. Consequently, its militants are more critical and more qualified to enter the working class, to agitate them and to instruct them while still preserving the freedom of not having to be part of the party to agree to the political line or to follow it. In addition, in a mass party where anyone can enter or leave when they want, also anyone can speak anything while identifying themselves as party member. Lenin was already warning to the dangers of this as well, I just don't recall in which debate and with whom this occurred. This is extremely problematic for a good communist work to have someone being contradictory or, say, racist while being a party member, and much harder to have control over it and act when it happens.\n\nSorry for taking only the \"easy\" ones, I'm sure many more qualified people can adress all of them.","created_utc":1515466419,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"kommunisthest","body":"Just learned about who JMP was yesterday thanks to the new [On Mass podcast](https://soundcloud.com/onmasspodcast/episode1), and today I stumbled upon this article. Thoughts on this?\n\n&gt; 5) Those who champion the enshrined practices of identity politics\u2013\u2013anti-oppression training, \"safe spaces\", rarified theories of privilege, abstract movementism\u2013\u2013are generally petty-bourgeois academics.  The irony is that while many of these people possess a significant level of intellectual privilege (and note that the post-modern theories behind this politics are currently accessible mainly to students and intellectuals) they do not grasp the privilege generated by their social class as the primary moment of privilege, or even recognize that they are economically privileged, when they speak of privilege, oppression, intersectionality, etc.  Hence the failure to produce a material analysis of oppression: under capitalism those who possess the most \"privilege\" are those who possess the most economic autonomy, i.e. the bourgeosie, and those who possess the intellectual autonomy to flourish in the spaces opened by identity politics also possess, in some very significant ways and regardless of their specific identities (oppressed or otherwise), the very privilege they imagine they lack.  None of this is to say that these practices were not at one point of time necessary, or at least the logical result of the class essentialism of a crude marxism, but just that they can be nothing more than a petty-bourgeois activism that produces neo-reformism.\n\n .\n\n&gt; 7) The legacy of identity politics has produced a problematic language idealism where we focus more on correct words and phrases rather than the material basis of oppression\u2026 And even in the moment where we imagine we are indeed combatting real world oppression we are, in fact, simply engaging with the level of appearance.  We often fail to recognize that those who lack the privileged education to understand the correct terminology and turns of phrase are not necessarily those who are chauvinist, just as we fail to recognize that those who possess the education to hide their chauvinism with the correct language are indeed the enemy.  This language idealism becomes nothing but a self-righteous exercise when it refuses to contemplate a praxis of mass pedagogy based on actually changing the material circumstances and instead focuses on anti-oppression training, atomized concepts of privilege, and how to speak correctly.  It becomes utterly rarified and intentionally ignorant when it demands that we waste our time examining every word and turn of phrase at the expense of changing the material circumstances upon which this language is dependent.  Moralism abounds.","created_utc":1515499186,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

For example, I'm using a computer right now who's technology and function goes beyond my understanding, yet I'm still able to use it to access the internet and communicate with people I have never met, and access information I've never known.\n\nIn the same way, I see China has gearing up and establishing itself after decades of horrendous imperialism and atrocities committed against it by imperialist powers, using its understanding of society given to it by its own struggles and using Marx to inform it. So long as the right people in China understand the system, it's not necessary for everyone to know it. Marxism should *never* be a dogma - it should be a tool used to understand society and change it to create better lives. We in the west use Marx more as a form of radical credibility than a living, breathing tool to empower the working class.\n\nLet's compare China with another country ravaged by imperialism - India. Do we feel hopeful for India? Do we feel it's economy and it's political system is geared up in order to help its people? While India pollutes, China goes Green. While India languishes in poverty and exploitation by western powers, China gives the world the largest increase in human standards of living in human history. Chinese people do not need to necessarily be aware of how the system works so long as they benefit (although it's preferable if they do understand, as with people all over the world).\n\nIf we hold out only for the 'true' communists, the pure, heaven descended perfect people we will never find happiness and we will never find progress. China, for all its flaws, is using Marx, and the productive forces of capitalism to benefit itself and humanity. I think we should appreciate that rather than look down on it for not fulfilling an unnatainable 'pure' Marxist vision.\n\nMarx spoke much in favour of materialism - we have to work with what we've got. What we have is China, and it's doing some damn good work.\n","created_utc":1515516927,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"lovelybone93","body":"https://www.marxists.org/archive/draper/1990/myth/myth.htm#n1\n\nIf you do read Lenin's WITBD, this is a good accompaniment to it. It reaffirms a section of the Manifesto which while not the end all, be all of Marxism, posits the party as an internal organ of the class which advances the interests of the working-class as clearly as possible. \n\nThe Leninist conception of the party reaffirms this by using relevant writings of Marx alongside harnessing the understanding of the uneven development of capitalism, even on a granular level, to firmly grasp the Marxist teachings that being determines consciousness as well as the teachings that the ruling ideas are those of the ruling class alongside the society we are born into and are shaped by as a result of previous generations works weighing on us like a nightmare. \n\nThis is central because it understands that the party cannot reduce itself to the lowest common denominator in order to count members like they would a box office or gate receipts while advancing banal things not actually advancing the supremacy of the working-class, i.e. advocating a softer, kinder, more gentler managed capitalism. \n\nKautsky and Lenin, early Lenin are very similar, even after the Kautsky-Lenin/SPD-RSDLP (B) split, Lenin continued to sound similar in ways to the so called \"pope of Marxism\" of his time before the split. Lenin was in shock after learning the SPD voted for war credits, stupefied at hearing this.\n\nThe RSDLP (B) and SPD were different. The SPD was legal, had trade unions or significant influence in them, and tried to be a mass party by sacrificing what was called the maximal program or proletarian revolution for gentler, managed capitalism by the state on the right end, and lefter SPD members wanted \"socialism\" via an electoral, gradual method. In practice, the two positions have indistinguishable effects. The RSDLP (B) did work using electoral methods as only one tool to further connect with the disaffected proletarians and peasants at times they were legal, they didn't always enjoy this. They didn't openly control trade unions, trade unions had a tenuous status, but they did establish links. The Bolsheviks also connected immediate pressing demands with the overarching need for a proletarian-peasant revolution.\n\nDemocratic centralism is the form that Marxist-Leninist parties and supposedly Trotskyist ones take wherein the central tenets of the 21 conditions of the 3rd maybe alongside the 4th if Trotskyist, international are taken into account, but how to apply these lines concretely to the conditions there are debated, voted on, and unanimously carried out after the closure of debate at party meetings and congresses. \n\nBordigists talk about organic centralism and the doing away with democracy for decision making, instead basically just doing whatever is most effective for advancing the supremacy of the working-class and promoting people to positions based on their merit and utility for that area of struggle. What this looks like as contrasted to democratic centralism in practice, I can't tell you.\n\nBanning factions was done because the fledgling Soviet Union was in a civil war and needed the utmost unity in practice, while a fractured party doesn't help in decision making in wartime for a conquest of power for the working-class. However, banning factions doesn't solve the problem without purging or combating opportunism at every instance.\n\nIf there is no official vanguard party, then one is formed via individual communists coming together to preserve, advance and apply Marxist theory via practice in advancing the supremacy of the working-class materially, not just in photo-op moments or publications, but real on the daily work according to local conditions which materially affect workers immediately and also long-term and not as immediately felt by workers in preparation for the proletarian revolution.","created_utc":1515540344,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"MLcommenter","body":"&gt;Did you mean this to come off as badly as it sounds?\n\nI'm not sure what exactly you're suggesting with this question, but if you don't think the government sends in all sorts of people bent on disrupting and controlling groups opposed to them, then you're misguiding people about the true nature of organizing within the tiny world that is the self-identified Marxist/socialist/anarchist organized activist scene.\n\nMIM once said there are more agents than activists in the American \"Left,\" and even pin-pointed the late 70s to early 80s as the time when this happened. You're free to believe this or not, but I think it's either true, or something like it. Some people seem to recoil at the idea normal people *spontaneously* do things to benefit their governments, without being explicitly told to do so. So like, just because someone finds out you're a communist and tries to get you fired from your job doesn't mean they're working for the government directly, they just do it for free, for whatever internal motivation they happen to have. An alternative explanation might rely more on this idea, but this generally goes against the 'False Consciousness' idea used to explain so much behavior in First-World Marxist circles.","created_utc":1515577321,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"TheGhostiest","body":"It seems a lot of Communists really don't get this. Non-Communists who use the quote obviously understand it less (and don't even know who wrote it). They seem to think opiates are just a drug that makes you dead to the world. A drug that makes you stupid and irrational. \n\nThey fail to grasp the fact that these drugs are necessary to some people's survival. That people take them because they can't deal with the harsh reality of this world, with the pain.\n\nReligion is something that masks peoples pain. It helps them to socialize in a nonsocial society. It helps them to have peace with their slavery and oppression. It helps them to justify their actions with ethics in a world where nothing they can do is ethical.\n\nCriticism of drug-use, religion, and the people's complacency is criticism of the very nature of our society and the question of 'Why should we be complacent?' It is the question of why we ensure this pain. Why we do not cure it or at the very least why we do not seek a real cure.\n\nAnd drugs and religion come in many forms, from cold medicines to illegal substances, from religion to Nazism, and even the defense of Capitalism.\n\nThese are that which cause us pain, but at the same time they end it. Each of us with our own vice.\n\nCriticism of these elements of society is the criticism of the violence which causes us pain, criticism of our oppression.\n\nAnd so we come to a point, where no more can be tolerated. That something must be done to cure our disease, if not for us than for our children. The opiates wear off and we break into a sweat of injustice.\n\nThe demand for immediate revolution is therefore not the demand for violence, it is the explicit and complete demand that our violence be immediately ended.\n\nCriticism of religion, of politics, of Capitalism, of our society, of anything that exists today, is the call to end our suffering. The call to end our oppression. The call to end our pain. \n\nThe call for a true cure, not a treatment.\n\nThis is why every Communist must be radical. Why we all must be revolutionary. \n\nMost people do not understand that because they are still addicted. Most don't even realize their addiction.","created_utc":1515703579,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

Capitalism, on the other hand, manages to take its massive, insurmountable, and inherent flaws and convinces the public that those flaws are separate from the system. In this way, capitalism perpetuates itself and perpetuates its horrors while adapting to public opinion. All other alternate systems are wiped off the map.

First popularized around 1901, Lebensraum became a geopolitical goal of Imperial Germany in World War I (1914\u20131918) originally, as the core element of the Septemberprogramm of territorial expansion. The most extreme form of this ideology was supported by the Nazi Party (NSDAP) and Nazi Germany until the end of World War II.\n\nFollowing Adolf Hitler's rise to power, Lebensraum became an ideological principle of Nazism and provided justification for the German territorial expansion into East-Central Europe.

{"author":"USAwasaninsidejob","body":"I don't know what fantastic imaginings anarchists project onto a character like Bukharin, but for me, coming fresh off of reading Ludo Marten's, Another View of Stalin:\n\nBukharin was basically an anti-marxist social democrat. Lenin among others remarked that of the old guard Bolsheviks he more than anyone showed evidence of not understanding the core tenets of what became Marxism-Leninism. This resulted in him displaying confusion about things like the necessity of the dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nAs a result, Bukharin was very confused about key questions that arose after the NEP. As the kulaks were enfranchised by the NEP Bukharin spread ideas about how they shouldn't be attacked directly. So basically as a small-scale civil war was breaking out he wanted inter-class solidarity and plurality. All the ML's worth their salt and listening to the poorer peasants opposed this.\n\nThis tendency towards petty-bourgois idealism concerning class struggle was a major problem - incorporating trends in thought that Trotsky also came to uphold in his lifetime - basically conciliation with small capitalists and a de facto move towards social democracy. From here you can read into all the conspiracies that the CPSU attributed to anti-soviet groups rubbing shoulders with Bukharin and Trotsky.\n\nThe reason ML's hate on these positions so much (and rightfully consider them matters of life and death) is because all the historical experience of the Soviet Union proved that these ideas were false.\n\nClass enemies like the kulaks WERE a dangerous source of instability to the fledgling Soviet regime and defeating the tendencies of its political logic inside the party was (despite a lot of chaos) the key to the Soviets surviving WWII. If Bukharin's ideas had been implemented before WWII there would have been no industry with which to defeat Nazi Germany. Bukharin and Trotsky were very naive when it came to estimating the strength of the Soviet social system. They thought that with socialist property relations established, the power of the proletariat was secure, no matter what small concessions were granted to other social classes. This (since 1991) has of course proven to be woefully incorrect.","created_utc":1515985967,"score":20,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"HysniKapo","body":"&gt;only that what happened in the south was the result of class struggle\n\nOf course. The crucial difference is that DuBois' wording is imprecise and suggests that what was going on in the South was a proletarian revolution rather than a bourgeois one. This is what leads him to write stuff like the Republican Party \"functioning in effect as a labor party.\" He isn't wrong in the sense that the GOP in the South relied on Black labor to carry out Reconstruction, but it still leaves open the idea that the Republican Party was anything other than bourgeois.\n\nBlack labor, as I said, was instrumental, but that did not make Reconstruction a precursor of the October Revolution. Not only was no one advocating socialism, but did Black laborers did not conceive the bourgeoisie as a hostile class to be suppressed alongside the plantation owners. Instead, Black labor operated under the leadership of the Republican Party, which (as we all know) ended up betraying the former slaves.\n\nAs for Menshevism, Allen doesn't call for relying on the bourgeoisie to \"carry out its historical role\" or whatever as Mensheviks advocated in Russia. He points out that it was the bourgeoisie which betrayed Reconstruction, just as Lenin argued that the bourgeoisie betrayed the 1905 Revolution in Russia. In other words, the proletariat had to carry out bourgeois-democratic tasks via a revolution under its own leadership; the bourgeoisie manifestly refused to do so.\n\n&gt;Allen's book was used as a justification of social chauvanism and World War I\n\nPresumably you mean WWII. The CPUSA supported it when the USSR was attacked and it assumed a global anti-fascist character, just like every other communist party in the world. It didn't need Allen's book.\n\nAs for justifying social chauvinism, can you elaborate\n\n&gt;Not saying it wasn't informative, only that it wasn't as good as DuBois' Black Reconstruction.\n\nAs Allen himself notes, his own book is merely an introduction. It isn't meant to be an either/or choice: you _should_ read both. DuBois' book is far larger and deals with many more subjects. The only major problem with his book, as Allen and other Marxist historians pointed out, was imprecise wording.\n\nAnother important book to read is Eric Foner's _Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution_.","created_utc":1516049304,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Stalin did micromanage parts of the Great Purges, as authors like J. Arch Getty (in _The Road to Terror_) and Stephen Kotkin (in Vol. II of his Stalin biography) point out.\n\nMolotov himself, speaking decades later, acknowledged that \"demands [for repression] came from Stalin\" and that Yezhov had been \"a good party worker\" (Getty, pp. 214-215), i.e. Yezhov acted to a considerable extent with Stalin's express support.\n\nIt wasn't until after Stalin's death that mass rehabilitations of executed communists such as Knorin, Enukidze, Rudzutak, Mezhlauk, Piatnitsky, Bubnov, Postyshev, Kosior, Krestinsky, and innumerable others was finally undertaken. The purges also undermined foreign communists as well, e.g. the execution of B\u00e9la Kun and  other Hungarian revolutionaries who lived in the USSR, or the repression against Polish communists which was so severe that the party itself was declared a den of spies and dissolved (a judgement subsequently acknowledged as slanderous and without foundation by both the CPSU and PUWP after 1956.)\n\nKhrushchev's \"Secret Speech\" was self-serving and indeed contains distortions and omissions, but it's a big leap to go from that to saying \"oh yeah bad things happened but Stalin isn't really responsible for any of them.\"","created_utc":1516054468,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

The simple truth, that the book is a very academic literature review with a narrow purpose which got surprisingly popular because of rising class consciousness in the United States, seems to be the biggest hump to get over. That's not to weasel out of critiquing Furr's larger view of the period, in fact you and Keeran are free too critique it here:\n\nhttps://clogic.eserver.org/2005/furr\n\nIt agrees (and disagrees) with many of the things you say but is far more sophisticated and not obsessed with Stalin himself.

I agree that the book is littered with statements, particularly the conclusion, which only confuses the issue and makes it appear the book is advancing some ideology. But we need to work against Furr himself here because *the value* of the book is its meticulous review of the available evidence on this particular question of great historical importance.

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"Stalin was a member of the party and followed democratic centralism, of course his name can be found in relation to the purges. But to claim that he was \"responsible\" for anything is to miss the point. \n\n&gt;Zhukov believes that, if Stalin had refused the appeals of the First Secretaries for the extraordinary \"troika\" powers, he -- Stalin -- would have most likely been voted out, arrested as a counter-revolutionary and executed. \". . . [T]oday Stalin might be numbered among the victims of the repression of 1937 and 'Memorial' and the commission of A.N.Yakovlev would have long since been petitioning for his rehabilitation.\"\n\n...\n\n&gt;One point will strike almost every reader right away. According to the \"cult of personality,\" of adulation that surrounded Stalin, we have been conditioned to think of Stalin as an \"all-powerful dictator.\" This foundational falsehood of the Cold War / Khrushchevite historical paradigm, exploded by the research reported here, has fatally distorted our understanding of Soviet history. In fact, Stalin was never \"all-powerful.\" He was stymied by the combined efforts of other Party leaders. He was never able to attain his goal of constitutional reforms. Nor was he able to control the First Secretaries and the local NKVD.\n\nLiberals criticize Stalin because they are making a larger political attack. So of course it is valuable to defend the historical record and Stalin as a communist. There was also specific political value in anti-revisionists upholding Stalin against Kruschevite attacks. Finally, the historical record is so warped that there is value on memes like \"Stalin did nothing wrong\" or \"Stalin was literally perfect\" as a system shock. \n\nBut among communists this isn't really necessary. Stalin's personal heroism advocating for democracy is worth defending but I don't see the value in your critique (specifically how it's framed) when the real discussion is what class forces were represented and why Stalin was a minority. If people want to use the 70% right 30% empty phrase that's fine as long as the 70% is communism and not \"post-Marxism.\" But when it's used to maintain a liberal critique of Stalin hidden in the 30% I have a problem.

{"author":"HysniKapo","body":"&gt;But to claim that he was \"responsible\" for anything is to miss the point.\n\nIn matters where he personally intervened, I see no reason not to hold him responsible. I've given one example (\"beat, beat!\"), so here's another: \"Comrade Yezhov: The names identified by me in the text with the letters 'ar' are to be arrested, if they have not yet been arrested.\" (Kotkin, _Stalin_ Vol. 2, p. 438.)\n\nIt is true that the CPSU(B) followed democratic centralism, but even here it should be noted, as was pointed out after Stalin's death by the Party itself, that these norms were increasingly violated, e.g. meetings of the Central Committee became infrequent (only six were held in the last sixteen years of Stalin's life, even though it was supposed to meet every four months according to the 18th Congress.)\n\nThe Politburo also suffered, e.g. \"Stalin's Cabinet: The Politburo and Decision Making in the Post-War Years\" by Yoram Gorlizki:\n\n&gt;It was some months after the war, and the formal dissolution of the State Defence Committee (GKO) on 4 September 1945, when the Politburo began to resume peacetime operations. Formally the Politburo continued in much the same vein as it had left off before the war, with a virtually identical membership and a similarly modest workload. At its meeting of 29 December 1945 the Politburo resolved to meet every other Tuesday for a short time, from 8 pm to 9 pm. . . . Meetings of the Politburo, however, tailed off following the session of 3 October 1946; over the rest of Stalin's reign there were only two further formal, enlarged sessions of the Politburo, on 13 December 1947 and 17 June 1949. The official Politburo in fact came to be overshadowed by the regular conferences of a narrow 'ruling group' which met routinely in Stalin's office. The composition of this circle. . . differed markedly from that of the formal Politburo. Excluded from [it] were those Politburo members who had either fallen foul of Stalin or who were cut off from the ruling circle for reasons of location or ill-health. For some time Stalin's suspicions had fallen on Voroshilov, Andreev, and, to a lesser extent, Kaganovich, all of whom were, despite their formal membership of the Politburo, not privy to the proceedings of the ruling group in the aftermath of the war. . . most resolutions issued in the name of the Politburo in the Stalin years were determined by this group. . . .\n\n&gt;A succession of leaders, including Malenkov, Beria, Voznesensky and Bulganin, gained admission to the group many months before their formal accession as full members of the Politburo. Stalin hence unilaterally elevated colleagues without having to go through the tedious formality of having them 'elected' as full members of the Politburo by the Central Committee. Stalin could also expel members from his group with unseemly ease.\n\nSo we should keep these things in mind. Bourgeois analysts who regarded the CPSU as an \"oligarchy\" or \"dictatorship\" nonetheless recognized a restoration of Lenin-era practices in the party after 1953, e.g. T.H. Rigby wrote in 1972 that \"one can identify an overall trend away from the arbitrary, structurally indeterminate pattern of decision-making characteristic of Stalin's system of personal rule. . . plac[ing] a premium on formal structures and regular procedures, thus promoting a reinstitutionalization of the supreme executive bodies of Party and State, in particular the Politburo.\"\n\n&gt;So of course it is valuable to defend the historical record and Stalin as a communist.\n\nAbsolutely. The CPSU continued to hold that Stalin was a sincere revolutionary who defended Marxism-Leninism, as is obvious from the Central Committee's July 30, 1956 resolution [On Overcoming the Cult of the Individual and Its Consequences](https://archive.org/details/OnOvercomingCultIndividual) and from reading [Stalin's article in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia](https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Stalin%2c+Josef+Vissarionovich).\n\n&gt;There was also specific political value in anti-revisionists upholding Stalin against Kruschevite attacks.\n\nKhrushchev's \"Secret Speech\" was not published in the USSR until the Gorby period and, as noted, was indeed full of omissions and distortions. Even anti-communist authors have pointed this out. There's a 1984 Politburo meeting where [the members criticize Khrushchev for the damage that speech did](http://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/111231). Furr's book, as Keeran notes, does contribute toward a critique of Khrushchev's speech despite its own weaknesses.\n\n&gt;and why Stalin was a minority.\n\nI don't think the historical record shows Stalin as a minority after 1934 at the very latest. If you could give a specific example where he is said to have been in a minority after that date, we could talk about it.","created_utc":1516153345,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

What with the dissolution of the IS, and the inevitable ongoing US occupation of Syria, I would like to have a more nuanced understanding of the politics. Thank you.\n\nThis subreddit has talked about this topic from time to time. /u/Zhang_Chunqiao has [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/7pxuiv/us_imperialists_will_establish_rojava_as_an/dslglrs/) on another one of the threads listing [helpful links](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/7ifwm8/a_liberated_area_in_the_middle_east_western/dqz7akk/) to learn more about what is happening. Other than that, we know the U$ imperialists want a \"[safe district](http://www.rojava-info.com/2018/01/us-plan-sdf-as-national-army-of-new.html?m=1)\" in the region as a base for their imperialism, so they can easily attack Syria (and by that thinking, undermine Iran). Not only does such a state [clearly violate](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/61v5g6/salih_muslim_the_cochair_of_the_pyd_expects_raqqa/dfhip6g/) the sovereignty of Syria with their [so-called \"decentralized\" government](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-pyd/syrias-raqqa-expected-to-join-kurdish-led-federalism-kurdish-leader-idUSKBN16Y1B0), creating an entity which will lead to regional chaos.

Again, the US will only aid the PYD and its military wing the YPG if that course of action furthers US imperial interests...interests which are fundamentally opposed to the interests of the vast majority of the entire region...it may well prove to be the road to \u201cfreedom\u201d (imperial patronage) for a small minority of bourgeois Kurdish elements...at the price of the enslavement of the majority of the population...It is important to stress that the US empire is not attempting to simply aid the Syrian Kurds\u2019 quest for political autonomy...necessary responsibility that falls upon Communists to remind the Kurds themselves who have been lured by this course of action and these reactionary alliances that they are mistaken in their choices...It is a Communists duty...to warn the PYD and its supporters that seeking such \u201caid\u201d from empire is a reactionary and dangerous policy.\n\nBeyond this, is the reality that while \"Western and even international \u201cleft\u201d...declare that the Rojava Kurds are \u201crevolutionary\u201d or somehow \u201cliberated\" such perspectives are \"an unfounded and [dangerous form of international solidarity](https://dissidentvoice.org/2017/05/a-liberated-area-in-the-middle-east-western-imperialism-in-rojava/)\" because\n\n&gt; ...the US support for the \u201cgood\u201d Kurds...is nothing new, mainly since 2014...\u201cGood\u201d Kurdish leaders have said behind the scenes that they are willing to cooperate with Israel, the apartheid and murderous Zionist state which has given limited military support to Iraqi Kurds...US soldiers are advising and assisting SDF and YPG soldiers....The US has also provided support to the Peshmerga, militia of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, part of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG)...If Rojava achieved access to the sea, they would be an even more \u201ceffective\u201d imperial proxy group since Western capitalist states could bring their military supplies to the coastline...Rojava has representative offices in numerous Western capitalist countries.\n\nFurthermore, Rojava is [an illegal entity](https://dissidentvoice.org/2017/05/the-illegal-entity-of-rojava-and-imperial-divide-and-rule-tactics/) without question:\n\n&gt; The Iranians and Syrians have stood against an autonomous entity like Rojava...the Syrian Constitution...is straightforward and clear, showing that Rojava sovereignty in clearly illegitimate...Furthermore, not only is the entity of Rojava, not even an internationally recognized state by any measure, illegal, but Western support of it violates sections of the UN Charter...The support for the \u201cgood\u201d Kurds, not the \u201cbad\u201d pro-Syrian government Kurds, is part of US meddling in the country...The plans to break-up Syria fit-in with imperial logic...Rojava would not be in existence without the diplomatic and military support of Western capitalists and undoubtedly an illegal entity...The \u201cgood\u201d Kurds...are part and parcel of the Western imperialist \u201cdivide-and-rule\u201d strategy to break-up the region into \u201cmanageable\u201d areas for the global capitalist class\n\n\n\nHence we should pay [less attention to Rojava](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/3ulvyi/american_leftists_need_to_pay_more_attention_to/cxgsm8u/) except to counter imperial lies and fight the [blood-sucking imperialists](https://leftistcritic.wordpress.com/2017/08/09/the-hilarious-and-deluded-criticisms-of-my-post-on-syria-trump-and-certain-kurds/) who want to [divide and conquer](https://leftistcritic.wordpress.com/2017/05/24/until-imperialism-is-defeated-in-the-region-the-kurds-and-the-syrian-arab-republic/) Syria without a doubt.\n\nThe other comments on here by /u/Zhang_Chunqiao, and /u/aldo_nova are also worth referring to.","created_utc":1516215120,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

America\u2019s elites, in other words, are highly efficient at passing on their advantages to their children. A true meritocracy must include \u201celite circulation\u201d. [\u2026] For others to move up, some must also move down. A society based on genuine merit would be in constant flux. Yet as Reeves shows, America\u2019s wealthiest fifth \u2014 those earning more than $112,000 a year \u2014 are particularly good at capturing most of the benefits [\u2026] Rich parents cram their children\u2019s weekends with tutorials to pass the ubiquitous tests that assess \u201cmerit\u201d. Reeves calls this system \u201ctestocratic\u201d. It is little wonder that those who lack such help feel society is stacked against them. That is without mentioning the leg-up conferred by internships \u2014 often unpaid. Nine out of 10 new hires at Goldman Sachs \u2014 which has paid internships \u2014 are former interns. Only the wealthy have the cash to put their children up in New York for the summer to do work experience.\" (and I have more of the same if you're not convinced)\n\nJust to close, a recent study by two economists at the Bank of Italy found that the wealthiest families in Florence today are descended from the wealthiest families of Florence nearly 600 years ago!  So the rise of merchant capitalism in the city states of Italy and then the expansion of industrial capitalism and now finance capital made little or no difference to who owned the wealth.\n\nAs of last, should I mention that the current market society, or marktkonformgeselleschaft as Merkel likes it, is utterly incapable of mending the current climate change crisis?\n","created_utc":1516225412,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"comrade_winter","body":"Exactly, and another good point to make that everyone always seems to miss, is that it is not sex or sexuality that is bad. Sex and sexuality is a good, healthy, normal part of life. What is bad and disgusting is the way that women's sexuality is seen and thought of as in a misogynistic and patriarchal society. It's women being seen as sex objects, not sex subjects, not equals, lovers, partners, but a thing that things are done to, an object to be used. Prostitution is men paying to use women, pornography is degrading, demeaning, and violent towards women, you see the theme in society over and over again that the women are there to be \"used\". This even pervades the very language a society speaks and how they talk about women. Look how many derogatory words there are for women and what they connote, versus what insults for men are. It's in the way that women are talked about and how it's usually completely different from how men are talked about in such situations. Add to this things like sexual harassment being so common and you can see how there is a pattern that pervades all facets of society in terms of how women's sexuality is viewed versus how men's sexuality is viewed. Yet society does not understand this at all, nor can they ever identify that it is what is the real problem, because it is seen as completely normal and natural for women to be objectified and degraded. It's just seen as women's \"role\" and completely normal to such a society, so both men and women are brainwashed to think this is how sex should be and that women should accept it and enjoy it. Hence you have feminists advocating for legalization of prostitution and thinking things like prostitution and pornography are \"liberating\" and thinking they are being so \"progressive\" for this. They miss the point and they fail to grasp and understand what the real problem is.

{"author":"MJoker_","body":"Ok, I got some free time. Unfortunately, since I'm working, I won't be able to give a very detailed answer as I would like to, but I hope it gives you some insight, tho.\n\nI would like that you considered two things first: \n\n**First thing**: My answer is mainly focused on Brazil, the country that I live in. I will probably mention some other countries but I won't focus on them too much because I never lived there nor studied as much as I wanted to.\n\n**Second thing**: I'm a Marxist-Leninist, studying Maoism at the moment, since I'm pretty fucking disappointed at my previous Party. I'm saying this because my answer will have a certain \"bias\" on that, but you shouldn't be surprised, given the sub we are in. :P\n\nAnyway, let's go.\n\n&gt;For example, their more nationalistic focus and commitment to the Patr\u00eda (personally I find it to be their downfall often). \n\nAs I mentioned in my previous comment, we have that focus because it's not just or mainly a Communism vs Capitalism thing, this goes back centuries. Foreign powers has us at our throat since ever, tbh. Be it Spain, Portugal or whatever. \n\nWe never really had our countries on our own hands, never had our destinies on our own hands. \n\nThat's why we tend to have a certain focus on \"Patria o muerte!\". \n\nThat doesn't mean we don't have a sense of solidarity amongst our selves down here. If you go to protests, it's pretty common to hear people singin stuff like \"Watch out, Imperialist! Latin American will be entirely Socialist!\" or stuff like that. \n\nBut most of the countries in America Latina (I will refer to Latin America as **AL** from now on) has a section of the Bourgeoisie in bed with the Imperialists (the bureaucratic bourgeoisie/compradores). For a Party to win elections they have to make alliances with *Latifundi\u00e1rios* (I think the translation is landlord? Think of them as Kulaks, lol) and the compradores or they will suffer a Coup (see Allende) or will have to fight an economic war with USA (see Venezuela, although I don't consider them to be Socialists).\n\nWith that laid out, for me, the answer obviously lies in a violent revolution. In Marxism-Leninism(-maybe Maoism, I still don't fully know, lol).\n\nBut, the thing is, we are pretty divided. Peru had a strong Maoist tradition, Argentina is more of a Trotskyist thing (poor Che), Brazil, my country, is really a mess when it comes to that. As of now, the so called left is so preocuppied with the \"Labor\" Party which is actually pretty sad.\n\nBut Marxism-Leninism was pretty big here, we even had our own attempt at revolution back in the 30's. But, when Cornchev attacked, this hit us pretty hard. The *Partido Comunista do Brasil (PCB)* was divided, and the Party which came to be of this split had another split, just so you can understand how fucked we were.\n\nThen Operation Condor came, AL was fucked. The guerillas were a big promise, but we were all in love (and understandably so) by the Cuban revolution and thought that the answer lied in Foquismo, for instance. If you look at some guerillas, you will learn that it went beyond borders. Now, my opinion here is that: we were pretty goddamn wrong. In Brazil, with the exception of Araguaia (which was the most successful), they were all Foquists. They all also failed.\n\nNow, imo, the path to our liberation lies in Protracted People's War. The last century proved to us that Foquismo only worked in Cuba because the conditions for it to work were already laid out. That's why that I think Maoism might be the banner AL should raise to finally drive the Imperialists the fuck out. But this takes time. And, again, that's my take on the subject.\n\n&gt;I\u2019m also curious about the role intersectionality can/should play in revolution. It seems that just as with everyday life native peoples, minorities, and workers put in the most work but then are not fully liberated by revolution when a middle class man is put in power. \n\nRegarding this, if you at least studied the history of Cuba, you would know that *machismo* has had a pretty big influence there. We were a bunch of sexists fucks and, honestly, we still are. For example, although I'm a Millennial (I think that I'm, at least. I always get confused by the definition. I lived the 90's so, yeah), I was raised believing that men shouldn't cry, women's place is in the kitchen and other outright ridiculous stuff. Bullying man who were somewhat outside of the norm by calling them \"faggots\" (sorry for the word) and stuff like that. \n\nIt's pretty sad, really. But things have been changing now, we have been fighting to change it, although one might say that some people are losing their minds regarding this fight (so called *P\u00f3s-Modernos*, as we call them here), believing that videoclipes with Anitta will help end the suffering of women, for example.\n\nThe thing is, in the last century, it was usually a *middle class man* because they were the most able to \"know\" and \"read\" about this type of stuff. Women were treated, in most of AL, like shit. Indigenous were persecuted in many countries (here they still are, somewhat), and so on. Depending on the country, the situations sucked so much (like Cuba), that it would be pretty surprising if it wasn't a middle class man. \n\nBut, if revolution is to happen in this century now, I think it would be very different. If you search for the *Liga dos Camponeses Pobres*, a Maoist league who fights for a New Democratic Revolution, you will see most of their leaders, especially the ones assassinated, were all poor, humble people, some of them of color too, some of them women, etc.\n\nMore so in the student/youth Maoist movement, there are some LGBT members in their ranks. \n\nAlthough I think Brazil doesn't have a Communist Party and one needs to be created, the so called ones have groups and such related to LGBT people. So, in this century, I think we will see some lesbian or trans or whatever as leaders, which would be pretty fucking cool. \n\nAnyway, I have to go now. I reread my comment and saw that it's mainly unorganized rambling, but I gave the best answer that I could, given that I'm at work right now. I wish I had time to write a proper answer. Maybe at night, on my home, I will. I just hope this was the type of discussion you wanted to have.\n\nHope it helps, at least. :D","created_utc":1516285577,"score":17,"subreddit":"communism"}

It is a sham, and it is just as self-gratifying as \"equal exchange coffee\" and shit. Ultimately only proletarian creativity will solve this crisis, by eliminating capitalism. Someone suggested to me after having shared this that rather than building these tiny homes and pod houses, why not just put people in the empty full sized ones. This is evading the real problem in capitalism not of supply, but of distribution. Certainly in the Third World there are areas with housing shortages, but in the west this is not the case. So recycled homes, as far as solving the problem goes, do not fit the bill. We are thinking backward to try to solve a rather obvious problem here. This \"minimalist\" ethic is just another bourgeois ploy, trying to sell people on \"affordability\" while they rob everything from the global proletariat.

That was Bolivar's project - to throw out the colonial powers for national independence of the different countries, and then go forward to unite them into one nation. Chavez explained how this was a socialist project in many ways, and the Bolivarian movement kind of resurrected Bolivar (sort of literally -- they dug him up and created 3-D portraits based on bone structure) as a heroic champion for anti-colonialism, anti-imperialism, socialism and broad regional unity.\n\nOn the topic of the personalization of the movements, it can't be denied! The big heroes of the Cuban revolution, Chavez, Evo and Correa were/are raised up to this incredible heroic level that it is alarming at first, especially for USAmericans or Europeans to hear militant socialists talking about \"eternal leaders\". But if you consider the fundamental, deep nature of the changes they helped to usher in, in some cases a complete upending of society from the most basic level, it becomes obvious why they would be so exalted. Something that Latin American movements are still pursuing is how best to keep the strength of the movement at a high level among the masses when it comes time for a transition in leadership, which is always a gap that counter-revolutionary forces want to pry open -- look at the variety of attacks against the movement in Venezuela after Chavez' death.\n\nI think Cuba will be OK in this regard because of the incredible strength and organization of their popular organizations like the central union, committees for defense of the revolution, Cuban women's federation, neighborhood councils, etc -- basically the people won't permit too many backward steps. Venezuela has also done some really interesting things with the communal councils, communes, and experimenting with shuffling around cabinet members so a lot of the leadership gets a lot of experience in many different areas of work.\n\nThen there are the Zapatistas and their whole orientation, which is totally different and worth study... such an incredibly diverse field of left politics in Latin America.","created_utc":1516301520,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

The media are one of the primary sites of struggle when it comes to ideology and the shaping of consciousness. We can look at the disgusting shit published in Venezuelan media, which is open -- supporting fascist street violence and more last year -- and predict what the Cuban media scene would look like within *hours* of a similar opening up of the media in Cuba. With that being said, Cuba has the full, open internet. So there is some openness and they are figuring that all out. It's a big test of the revolution.\n\nThe \"marketplace of ideas\" put forward by liberal democratic ideology about the media is dead and buried in the age of giant, worldwide capitalist media conglomerates. There is very little stock or effort in the US and a lot of Europe put into investigation or verification of government claims. Journalists have become stenographers for imperialism. We're in a weird place now where media \"openness\" has led to its exact opposite to the point that state-run media from abroad is some of the most valuable journalism people in the US can engage with today -- CGTN, Cuba's many great publications, TeleSUR, RT to a lesser extent.\n\nIt's a sad state of affairs and not one that is likely to change before the revolution, in my opinion.

Our job as communists is to demonstrate the correctness of our Marxists theory through conveying the ineptitude of the bourgeoisie and the moribund nature of capitalism. We do not need to coddle the vast oppressed classes- they are the ones experiencing this ineptitude and this decaying waste of potential- we only point out and clarify what their experience confirms. \n\n&gt; if there wasn't a stigma around leftist literature,\n\nThis is in massive part because of massive swaths of the \"left\" regurgitating anti communist propaganda. Nearly all shades of leftism except for a few varieties of Marxism-Leninism condemn the SU and PRC etc as \"Stalinist\" or some other Khrushchevite/ revisionist lie. This unwillingness to break with the bourgeois interpretation of history signifies a desire to cut the roots of the left's history, a history it is *crucial* we learn from maturely, not just reject it out right the same way the bourgeoisie does.

In practice and organisation, they are cult-like in operation. Basically the ISKCON of left orgs. \n\n\nThey will demand more and more of your time, and put quite a lot of pressure on you to eschew things like study or work. This alienates the member from their roles in ordinary life. \n\n\nThey will demand that you only speak on political subjects, which reinforces the dogma and discourages the formation of meaningful friendships that have the potential to create an in-road for criticism against the org (If you have nobody inside the org to relate to and to divulge your concerns to, your concerns will go unsaid and unheard). Strictly-political relationships between other members allow plenty of discussion within the dogma, but only relationships built on something other than politics will allow two members to have objective discussions about the org and the dogma. Make no mistake, if you try to rock the boat or even ask a question that sounds like the beginnings of a mind to rock the boat, there will be whispers and you will be assigned a \"buddy\" to helicopter you.\n\n\nThey will put you to work selling papers - which is unpaid labour - and will refuse to acknowledge the absurdity of this, when you consider some like 101 Marxist tenets. If your sales numbers are low they will helicopter you. To add insult to injury, you are required to pay for your own subscription to both the paper and the academic quarterlies. \n\n\nThey will force you to alienate yourself from the broader political scene in your city by putting you to work- you guessed it- pushing more papers at every rally and creating in the rest of the political public an association between you and some bad taste in their mouth.\n\n\n\"Have you bought your ticket to the conference yet?\" - When you go, watch closely to notice the way that the non-Trot guest speakers get hot under the collar and wriggle and squirm. They know something's not right.\n\n\nOnce you have been involved for a decent amount of time, and after they have piled more and more on your plate, Comrade!, test the waters and mention that you're thinking of cutting back on your involvement or even taking a break altogether. Anything but the word 'Understanding' will apply. Teeth-clenching is guaranteed.\n\n\nKeep an eye out for a top layer of members. These are the ones who are actually friends not only as members but in a social sense. Which is an achievement. They will try to blend in as rank and file. Spot one and ask them where your dues are going.\n\n\nu/ToasterLogic You and I probably agree on a whole lot of theory. But there are some pretty concerning practices in trot orgs, especially the prominent ones, and it is something that has been known for a while. It flies in the face of the whole spirit of M,L,T thought and is incredibly calcified, reinforced and insurmountable. Get out while you can and just engage at the grassroots level, unaffiliated. The sooner you leave the better off you'll be. Expect some lashing out, extra criticism and attention on your social medias, and to be immediately ostracised and ex-communicated.

J. Moufawad-Paul is opportunist in *Continuity and Rupture* by trying to make the RIM responsible for Maoism. The struggle to solidify MLM as the only revolutionary tendency in the world is not yet complete because many parties calling themselves Maoist do not uphold these universal principles, like the Communist Party of the Philippines which is lax on revisionism abroad and does not see PPW as universal outside semi-feudal and semi-colonial countries. Joma even says that Mao Zedong Thought and MLM are the same in terms of content which is wrong. Furthermore JMP and the pan-Canadian RCP hold that Maoism is somehow a \"rupture\" from Marxism-Leninism but Maoism does not invalidate parts of Leninism. Again this is opportunism and opens up the possibility of them revising the theory. Marxism-Leninism is still correct and it doesn't have \"limits\" that require a rupture because the science is in-progress and always able to develop, but remaining a Marxist-Leninist and denying the developments of Maoism is a form of dogmatism and such people are not truly Leninists or Marxists if they're not using the science the way Lenin and Marx did.

Again to round off in our critics' favor, let's assume that to be 900,000 deaths a year for seven years as the deaths from normal causes. So for example, in 1936, that would mean a crude death rate from normal causes of less than 5 per 1000 a year, based on a population of 180.2 million people in the Soviet Union.\nThat's impossible and the death rate has never been that low in the Soviet Union, Stalin or no Stalin, not even in 1982, when the crude death rate was 10.1.

{"author":"right_makes_might","body":"A rupture essentially means that some aspects of the previous thing are incorrect. JMP in that work and others describes how different political tendencies are a result of different degrees of recognition of rupture from what existed before in ML to what becomes necessary now.\n\nMao Zedong Thought is the result of perceiving Mao's practical and theoretical additions as being in complete continuity with ML, as they were at the time of the New Communist Movement in the west. It is the perspective that that Mao made essential contributions to Marxism-Leninism, and that these contributions are wholly compatible with the Marxism-Leninism practiced by the USSR and comintern prior to the victory of revisionism.\n\nPost-modernism in contrast, looks at the overall failure of Marxism-Leninism to continue to spread worldwide and to maintain socialist states as socialist as a flaw fundamental to Leninism and Marxism such that there are no aspects of ML which can be salvaged and used by progressive movements. So, post-modernism is a complete rupture from Marxism and ML.\n\nPost-Maoism can be seen as a kind of continuity-rupture as well in that it is continues to uphold certain aspects of Marxism, but rejects or \"rupture\" with other crucial aspects, such as the necessity of the vanguard party. So it continues to little and ruptures with too much.\n\nMLM is the correct analysis because it alone identifies which elements of Marxism-Leninism must be kept, while also identifying which of Mao's contributions are universal, and how some of those contributions are in fact a rupture with ML. The \"rupture\" is recognizing that there are some of Mao's contributions which *are* correct and universal, but *are not* compatible with Marxism-Leninism.\n\nThose who say that they uphold MLM but do not think that there is any rupture with ML are MLMZT in essence, and fail to grasp the very things which make MLM significant.\n\nDoes that help?","created_utc":1516420285,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"right_makes_might","body":"I'm going to quote some passages from Continuity and Rupture to help with my point. The following is from Chapter 3: The General Limits of Marxism-Leninism. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nHe starts off with a quote from The State and Counter-Revolution, a work that sums up the experience and collapse of the Communist Worker's group, which was an American MLMZT party, then follows to simplify Clark's points with this:\n\n&gt;So what is Clark claiming if he is not simply dismissingMarxism-Leninism as an erroneous politics and advocating a theoretical reinvention of the wheel? I will simplify the above passage to its most salient points.\n\n&gt;1.  The working-class caught up in trade unions cannot produce a revolutionary organization by itself because, in this context, it is only capable of producing an economism (\u201ctrade-union consciousness\u201d), or a defiant anarchism, but not a mediating party that produces a revolutionary movement with a coherent and revolutionary theory. Here we must recall Althusser\u2019s analysis of the philosophy of Marxism-Leninism where he points out that the working-class, which spends most of its time working, can only conceive of its rebellion according to the ruling ideas of the ruling class.\n\n&gt;2.  And yet the revolutionary party that approaches the working class tends to be a party composed of petty-bourgeois intellectuals who are only capable of having a thorough appreciation of theory and revolution because, unlike the workers they claim to represent, they possess a measure of social privilege: they have the time to be students or academics. Here we must recall that, in What Is To Be Done? Lenin agrees with Kautsky\u2019s claim that the party is initiated by the petty-bourgeoisie.\n\n&gt;3.  The party began by these intellectuals, since it recognizes the proletariat as being the grave-digger of capitalism, must impart revolutionary theory to the workers so that these workers can also be intellectuals. The workers must rely on these intellectuals in order to comprehend revolutionary theory, to understand a revolution that is supposedly about their own interests.\n\n&gt;4.  A given worker\u2019s intellectual development is decided by the petty-bourgeois educator; it is these petty-bourgeois intellectuals who have the privilege of judging whether or not the workers are learning properly, just as they have had the privilege to decide what these workers should learn in the first place\u2013\u2013indeed, what counts as proletarian ideology. Hence the germ of the contradiction: the petty-bourgeois class becomes the authority on proletarian ideology when, according to the very ideology they seek to impart, social being should determine social consciousness\u2013\u2013how can someone whose class position is petty-bourgeois ever be fully capable of having a proletarian consciousness and thus understanding proletarian ideology?\n\n&gt;5.  The petty  bourgeoisie remains in charge of the movement, its outlook misconceived as proletarian ideology, the meter of revolutionary theory, and thus petty-bourgeois ideology becomes sublimated in the movement itself. Counter-revolution happens precisely because there is an unquestioned petty-bourgeois basis to Marxist-Leninist revolutionary movements. \n\n&gt;Finally, we can simplify all five of these salient points, as well as the passage itself, to this basic statement of contradiction: on the one hand it is impossible for the proletariat to spontaneously develop a revolutionary party with a revolutionary ideology; on the other hand it is impossible for a party that the workers cannot possibly develop, and thus is developed instead by the petty bourgeoisie, to carry a revolution to its completion. In essence: Marxism-Leninism is correct while, at the same time, Marxism-Leninism is incorrect.\n\nJMP argues that Clark's analysis of applies to ML as a whole, and that this limit is not something which can be overcome within ML as a movement. He then goes on to describe how Maoism does overcome this contradiction:\n\n&gt;During the course of the Chinese Revolution the contradiction noted by Clark was encountered and theorized: the petty-bourgeoisie is indeed within the party, bourgeois ideology leads to party degeneration, and the fact that the party leads the masses while being affected by this ideology is a significant problem. The solution, then, was to unleash the masses upon the party and even upon each other. The problem of the ideological instance was even larger than Clark\u2019s analysis grants: the common-sense ideology prior to the dictatorship of the proletariat is still a default ideology, is prevalent everywhere in society, and this is why socialism remains a class society.\n\n&gt;Leaving aside the absurd notion that to even define the nature of this ideology is in itself an act of privilege (for this leads, as noted in the previous section, to an inability to even make this critique in the first place), we should at least recognize the fact that the GPCR produces a way of moving beyond the contradiction of Marxism-Leninism. This is because the party does not simply lead the masses; the party also must be held to account by the masses and in this accounting class struggle continues. Those petty-bourgeois intellectuals who once defined the meaning of revolution, if they were indeed petty-bourgeois intellectuals, should be called to account by the very revolution they once claimed to represent. China\u2019s failure to complete this revolution simply tells us that it failed to follow this understanding to its logical conclusion, that although it glimpsed a terrain beyond the limits of Marxism-Leninism it was still imprisoned within its historical boundaries.\n\n&gt;Only an assessment of the failures and successes of this period could produce the theoretical rupture capable of over-stepping Marxism-Leninism. Hence the emergence of Maoism in the period of 1988\u20131993 when these contradictions, finally self-evident, demanded a paradigm shift in the field of revolutionary science, guided by the concepts that manifested in the course of the Chinese Revolution. Maoism, then, is precisely that stage that not only recognizes Clark\u2019s contradiction but understands it in a properly scientific manner, can explain precisely how it led to counter-revolution, and thus indicates a practice that can pass beyond the boundaries of Leninism.\n\n&gt;After all, the Leninist party is completed according to the understanding that the concept of proletarian, as noted above, is consummated in the party itself which preserves the theory of what it means to be proletarian in the first place. And yet, this is not enough: a party that treats itself as the \u201cgeneral staff\u201d of the proletariat, without submerging itself in the class it has conceptualized, must always remain apart. To think of a party that not only conceptualizes the meaning of \u201cproletariat\u201d but submerges itself in the social classes it attempts to mobilize, however, is the province of Maoism. This is what is known as the mass-line: the party brings the theory of revolution to the masses, submerges its members in these masses and, by drawing them in, transforms the party itself.\n\n&gt;A party formation that functions according to a general theory of the proletariat that is not submerged in the masses, and has not drawn these masses into its organizational structure, is a formation that can never become a vanguard. The reason for this is very simple: if the party cadre are only dispersed intellectuals then they can easily be bought off by capital: a would-be academic, no matter how radical their politics are on paper, might be neutralized by the promise of tenure, freedom of speech, and publishing contracts. Similarly, a party cadre who discovers, through this party, that they have nothing left to lose but their chains will sustain this party, will teach the would-be academics something about party discipline, and will possibly become a party intellectual (for the Maoist turn in Marxism demands that every party member becomes an intellectual) capable of challenging the traditional intellectual apparatus.While a germinal party formation might initiate and preserve itself according to those who have had the privilege to encounter and study revolutionary theory, it will only become more than its germ form by drawing in those who are deeply invested in revolution and, because of this investment, can discipline the party into a fighting force capable of becoming a vanguard.\n\nTLDR: JMP argues the point in much greater detail, but I think these two quotes explain it sufficiently well. In short, the problem with ML is a problem with how a party initiated and lead by the petty-bourgeoisie can create and maintain a proletarian ideology and political line. It can't, at least not in the long run. The petty-bourgeois elements will eventually lead to revisionism and counter-revolution, and this can win over within the party either before the revolution or after. It is from this basis that we see that class struggle continues under socialism, and within the party. It is only by grasping the significance of the cultural revolution and the mass line that this can be overcome, that the energy of the masses must be unleashed on the party in order to rectify its mistakes if, and when, revisionism takes over.

{"author":"champ1337","body":"I have the full article:\n\n**Angry students turn to Marx in their pursuit of revolution**\n\n\u201cHis name will endure through the ages, and so also will his work.\u201d So said Friedrich Engels at the graveside of his friend, Karl Marx.\n\nNearly three decades after the demise of the Soviet Union, Marxist thought is enjoying a resurgence on university campuses as students facing worse life prospects than their parents are drawn to revolutionary ideas.\n\nThis week polling emerged showing that more than twice as many young people regard big business as a danger than are fearful of communism. The ComRes research also found that 18 to 24-year-olds were more likely than any other age group to believe that equality is more important than freedom.\n\nAs memories of the Soviet era fade, socialism is no longer a dirty word. Separate YouGov polling found that Britons were more likely to view socialism as preferable to capitalism.\n\nLeft-wing ideas have always flourished on campuses but this year Marxist groups are using the 200th anniversary of the German thinker\u2019s birth and the 50th anniversary of the 1968 student protests to promote millennial militancy. In May hundreds of students and academics will gather at London\u2019s School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas) for \u201cMarx 200\u201d, a conference devoted to the philosopher\u2019s relevance.\n\nGuest speakers include John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor who has described himself as a Marxist, and Sitaram Yechury, general secretary of the Communist Party of India. \u201cWhy Marx was right,\u201d is one topic scheduled for discussion.\n\nStudent Marxists, while still a minority, are increasingly organised. This academic year Marxist groups ran the first concerted nationwide campaign to get supporters elected as National Union of Students (NUS) conference delegates. Three candidates \u2014 from UCL, Swansea and Soas \u2014 have already secured places. Ben Gliniecki, 26, a Cambridge University law graduate and national organiser of the Marxist Student Federation (MSF), which is active on 32 campuses, said that anti-capitalist arguments that had no resonance before the 2008 crash now appealed to a significant chunk of the student body.\n\nMore than 3,000 students signed up with Marxist groups at freshers\u2019 fairs last year, a significant jump on 2016. The recruits hold more radical and revolutionary views than previous members, he added. \u201cThe 18-year-olds who are signing up are interested not in this or that little campaign,\u201d Mr Gliniecki said. \u201cThey are interested in the big ideas about revolution and fundamentally changing society.\u201d The federation\u2019s Facebook page has 12,000 followers and its Instagram account features photos of supporters posing with the left-wing newspaper Revolution in exotic locations, from ski lifts to Napoleon\u2019s house on Elba. Several viral-friendly pictures show pets reading the paper, complete with \u201cKommunist Kitty\u201d and \u201cfat cat\u201d puns.\n\nCommunism may appear cool again but Fiona Lali, president of the Marxist Society at Soas and an NUS conference delegate, said it was insulting to suggest that students embraced left-wing politics to be fashionable. \u201cYoung people have been left in an economy and a society in which they have very little chance,\u201d she said, pointing to high student debt, unaffordable housing and zero-hours contracts. \u201cCapitalism has outlived its usefulness.\u201d Ms Lali\u2019s defence of the Soviet Union on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this week drew a rebuke from the historian Orlando Figes, who told The Times that the drive for balance in academia risked minimising Joseph Stalin\u2019s crimes.\n\nIn response Ms Lali, 20, accused Professor Figes of \u201cselective outrage\u201d and ignoring the millions killed by capitalism and colonialism. \u201cDespite the monstrosity of the Stalinist regime, we can see the power and strength of a planned economy,\u201d she said.\n\nMeirian Jump, from the Marx Memorial Library in London, said that the number of young people attending classes had risen noticeably in recent months, and that students had to be turned away from oversubscribed lectures celebrating 150 years since Das Kapital. \u201cThere is dissatisfaction with the status quo \u2014 notably austerity and neoliberalism \u2014 and a renewed enthusiasm for exploring alternatives,\u201d she said. Rising campus interest in Marxism has coincided with the Jeremy Corbyn surge. The Labour leader has pledged to abolish university tuition fees and high youth turnout was credited for driving his party\u2019s strong showing in the general election.\n\nThe Marxist Student Federation encourages its supporters to join Labour \u2014 Mr Gliniecki praised Mr Corbyn as the \u201ccutting edge of the anti-austerity movement\u201d \u2014 but activists do not hide their ambition to pull the party even further to the left.\n\nRestoring Clause IV of Labour\u2019s constitution, which committed to securing \u201ccommon ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange\u201d, is a key short-term objective.\n\nThe nationalisation pledge was dropped by Tony Blair in 1995 and even Mr Corbyn has been reluctant to back reinstatement of the original wording.\n\n\u201cI would fight for a Corbyn government but then I\u2019d push that further. Don\u2019t just nationalise the railways, nationalise the banks,\u201d said Ms Lali, a third-year student. \u201cUltimately the goal is the overthrow of capitalism.\u201d\n\nThe two other Marxist candidates elected as NUS delegates are Emilie Dufwa, a second-year philosophy student at UCL, and Ross McKendrick of the Swansea Marxist Society. Mr McKendrick, 21, a fourth-year law student who describes himself as a Trotskyist appalled by the horrors of Stalinism, said that the mood on campus had changed. \u201cWhen I first started university if you raised Marxist ideas in a social setting you\u2019d be treated like a black sheep,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, people come up to me at house parties.\u201d","created_utc":1516470974,"score":31,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"NothingButBits","body":"Clearly this is a hot and controversial topic so here goes my opinion (I hope I don't get banned!):\n\nRight now the current Imperialist world order is commanded by the US. They dictate how the world functions with some exceptions (DPRK, Cuba, China, etc.). They are also backed by the countries in NATO, so whatever destabilizes this order is a good thing for the non-Imperialist countries.\n\nThe US is forcing Turkey to bend over and to accept the Kurds as a new nation, this is clearly against Turkish interests. This conflict of interests will have to be resolved between them both. It depends how much the US is going to antagonize Turkey with their new plans for the region and how much Turkey is willing to bend over for US interests. Turkey has recently bought a lot of armament from Russia, this is clearly a sign that they may break away from the US.\n\nSince Turkey has already been denied entrance in the EU (because of the Erdogan coup), and now with the Kurdish situation they are starting to have no reasons to stay in NATO. So if they were to break away from NATO and make an alliance of some sort with Russia, I think it would be a good thing because it would weaken NATO and would represent a severe blow to US interests in the region.\n\n\nOf course, this is all speculation, Turkey may just as well allow itself to be broken apart by the US and continue to aid them in destroying Syria. If so, then nothing really changes.","created_utc":1516497413,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

My dad hasn't looked at me the same way since I've become a communist and started to read a ton of theory. We still joke together, and hang out and still love each other. But I'll catch him sometimes, just with this look of how on Earth did my son become this way. And it hurts. A lot. I sometimes don't want to go home just to avoid that feeling of discomfort. My mum is much more open, but she also doesn't care that much, she'll listen and argue a bit then just stop caring and go work or watch TV. But my dad's not like that. He's a pretty smart guy (so is my mum, but I digress). Quiet. Rarely speaks his mind. But just that attitude you get from him. It's saddening. It makes me question it too. And it's a personal struggle that I (and you) have to deal with and overcome. \n\nBut hey. You do you. If you got all that in your head going on.

There three stages when it comes to a revolution - a strategic defense, a strategic equilibrium and a strategic offense. This represents the growth of the objective forces of the revolution and the spread of liberated areas and red bases where the Communist Party has influence and the masses have risen up. This can only be done by the construction of the Party who leads the revolution, the Army which fights for the revolution and the United Front which unites organizations for the revolution. This is a fact. The insurrectionist tactic of focusing too much on building a legal Party before an armed uprising without the development of the army has failed countless of times before.

{"author":"theredcebuano","body":"A lot of people's suggestions here basically amount to: \"read more\" or \"show documentaries\" which I don't recommend. Yes, it is important to read and learn, but at the cost of the valuable praxis you should be doing right now? Learn from the masses and then teach them! That is the basic thought of the Maoist principle of the mass line. It should be applied with all organizations. \n\nWhen it comes to building organizations, there are four principal forms of mass work that has to be engaged in: \n\na. Work in Social Investigation\n\nb. Work in Propaganda and Education\n\nc. Work in Organizing\n\nd. Work in Mobilizing \n\n**WORK IN SOCIAL INVESTIGATION** \n\nWhat is the correct method in investigating society? Well, the class analysis. Students have a petty bourgeois ideology and they are stuck between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. Those who are poorer will obviously have more sympathy for the proletariat and those who are richer will relate more with the bourgeoisie. You should be able to understand what groups in the school face forms of oppression. Poor students may face it in the form of tuition, LGBTQ+ in the form of homophobia, etc. And whenever it is possible, one can unite with the richer students who tend to be more idealistic in the sense that they stand up for what they believe in. Whenever there are local issues, make sure to inform other people and see who are affected. \n\n**WORK IN PROPAGANDA AND EDUCATION** \n\nI advice you not to begin with hardcore Marxist classics such as the Manifesto or whatever. Why? Because following the mass line, you will see that there are those who are politically backwards, those who are intermediate and those who are advanced. The advanced people constitute people like you, who I assume to be well versed with Marxist-Leninist-Maoist material. But the intermediates aren't yet, and they are your source for new recruits. You'll end up alienating them. What's the better way instead? You should focus on, as Mao says, linking the particular with the general. Presenting a Marxist analysis of the problems and tracing its roots back to capitalists. There should at least be a course perhaps of the most pressing problems in the locality and nationally, how they affect the poor and marginalized and to be explained through a Marxist lens. \n\nWhen it comes to propaganda, you should have a way to show other people what your organization is doing. Posters, signs can do fine. Facebook pages should also be used with utmost efficiency. Also, I suggest renaming your group from \"Communist Society\" to something more mellow like \"Anti-Capitalist Society\" or \"Revolutionary Students Group\" or whatever, mainly for security reasons. \n\n**WORK IN ORGANIZING** \n\nHaving no members is bad objectively. However, you were able to organize an event on what communism is, so there is something you should be proud of. I suggest you form an \"Organizing Committee\" from various sectors. Since you guys have a leftist network, that can be your basis. The task of an OC is, of course, to organize, to bring in more members and host events. And the good thing about this is that it can do so through different organizations. One OC can organize a bunch of different organizations with representatives from each org. You should have at least five members in an OC. It's probably here where you can begin with studying more hardcore things. If reading won't cut it, use powerpoint presentations. Mainly your OC should study the basis of unity in work and the mass line, that way you could understand deeply what Marxism is and actually use it in praxis. \n\n**WORK IN MOBILIZING** \n\nFinally, you will realize that this is a process. Social investigation leads to education which leads to organizing and finally - mobilizing. Mobilizing is telling the students \"all right, we know this situation is shit so we're going to do something about it.\" Protests, rallies, all are forms of mobilization. You could also do stuff like Facebook photo-ops, class boycotts, etc. \n\nThere's a lot to be said in this topic. Message me if you can! I'll be glad to help. I'm one of the youth activists in the revolutionary movement in the Philippines, so I definitely have my experience. ;) Here are some sources that could help you: \n\n1.

They are the method you use for understanding society. Mainly here, what needs to be focused on are the economic relations between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie and the dialectical relationship between wage and capital which is very useful when it comes to organizing \n\n7. [Socialism: Utopian and Scientific by Frederick Engels](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/index.htm) - what should be focused on are what makes Marxism scientific, the dialectical method of analyzing history and the development of capitalism to socialism\n\n8.

Only 10 per cent of U.S. \"aid\" to Africa is spent on industrialisation, and most of this is in those areas regarded as \"safe\" for capitalism. In contrast, 70 per cent of aid from socialist countries is spent on industrialisation and the organisation of profitable production. Interest rates on loans from capitalist countries vary from between 6\u00bd to 8 per cent, whereas socialist creditors charge only 2\u00bd per cent. Aid from socialist countries is used mainly for state projects. This again is in striking contrast to \"aid\" from the West, which is almost entirely in the private sector.\n\n[...]\n\n&gt;The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.\n\n&gt;Non-alignment, as practised by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments. He may, in fact, do better for himself if he invests in a non-aligned country than if he invests in a neo-colonial one. The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not a master of its own destiny.\n\n*Neo-Colonialism, the Last Stage of imperialism*\n\nNow one would obviously have to look more deeper into the actual loans and \"aid\" that the PRC provides to the different countries, to find out what is going on. Granting loans can be positive thing, but it can also be a negative thing, it depends on a lot of factors.\n\nSamir Amin said this in an interview conducted by Walter Baier in Vienna, September 2017:\n\n&gt; WB: And what is the role of China in a global perspective?\n\n&gt;SA: China should and could play a positive role, initiating a multi-centred global system, which Chinese leadership calls \u2018anti-hegemonic\u2019. For the sake of diplomacy, they prefer not to call it \u2018anti-imperialist\u2019, which in fact they have in mind. To move in that direction, there are some good signs and some bad signs. The good signs are at the political level. The Silk Road is not a trade agreement; it is a political way to make a rapprochement \u2013 a serious one \u2013 with Russia, with the Central-Asian republics and Iran \u2013 and therefore holds the door open for Middle-Eastern and Arab countries. It is positive. But it can remain wishful thinking on paper if it is not followed by complementary policies at the economic level. It is wrong to reduce the target of that strategy to ensure for China the access to oil. China can help Russia  to reconstruct its industrial capacity, can help Iran and eventually other Middle East countries to construct it. The other part of the Chinese global geo-strategy - I refer here to the transport route through South East Asia \u2013 by rail from China to Singapore and to Rangoon \u2013 bears different objectives: merely facilitate commercial penetration, or again helping the countries involved to industrialize and move partly away from imperialist control?\n\n[...]\n\n&gt; WB: Would you say that the influence of China on Africa is helpful for the respective countries?\n\n&gt;SA: It could be. Until now it is mainly wishful thinking and an ambition to have commercial penetration. It is less bad than trading with the West, because trading with the West is accompanied by conditionality, and trading with China has no conditionality, but it is not the solution to the problems of African societies.\nI\u2019ll give you a concrete example. In Zambia, after Kaunda was replaced by terribly ugly, pro-Western corrupt leaders, a new government was elected, not a revolutionary one. Three months after the election they invited me and asked me directly: We will soon receive a Chinese delegation. What do you think we can get out of this relation with China? I frankly said : the Chinese know what they want. They want copper. They do not mind if they invest in a private or in a state company, provided they also get an agreement that the copper gets to China and about a system of pricing. They know what they want. But you, what do you want? You have to know what you want. Do you want infrastructure? They can do it. Do you want industry? They can help. Do you want a revival of the peasantry? They have experience. You have to know what you want and you will probably get it. If you don\u2019t know what you want, the Chinese will get what they want with no counterpart to your benefit. You can get from them what you cannot get from the West. The West is imperialist. You have to know that. And my interlocutor told me: \u2018my administration doesn\u2019t know it.\u2019\n","created_utc":1516564530,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

This can be identified as an opportunistic trend which leads toward reformism, especially in the rich western countries, sure. However, to then say that the original strategy for revolution devised by the Bolsheviks in the capitalist countries doesn't or didn't work (a hard notion to press, considering it has worked) on the basis of opportunistic misapplications of the theory concerning hegemonic struggle is completely bogus.\n\nSecondly, it must be stated right off that the notion of constructing permanent red bases, that is, areas controlled by communist forces, within the rich western countries has neither been achieved nor even substantially tested. It is difficult to say right off that something like that can or will work given the fact that one of the reasons people are so persistent in saying that people's war is the only alternative to the insurrectionist strategy or even a viable one in the west is that the repressive forces are \"too strong\" or some shit. How does it make sense that the repressive forces, which can deploy anywhere in the country a large force within a matter of hours, can be undermined by stable, open construction of red power in base areas, either rural or urban? The problem with the constant insistence of PPW being universal in the united $tates is that it almost always requires abstraction so deep that one cannot imagine, much less achieve, any practical points on its basis. The PCR-RCP, despite its size, has no red bases. Perhaps it is too early, they do not have adequate strength. When, then shall they have them? How will the people's war be built with the aid of localized revolutionary situations fed by a people's army and institutions that literally manage the lives of the people within their grasp? It appears that, unfortunately for them, their struggles have, beyond insisting that it is PPW, resorted to tactics that are more indicative of an insurrectionist style. They do workplace struggles, build links between themselves and the masses. They practice the Mass Line, or at least it appears that way, but they do not substantially manage the lives of anyone. Their struggle is almost entirely legal, although they do (both in the united $tates and kanada) constantly hype their activities of being the \"strategic defensive\" of a great revolutionary war. \n\nI would suggest that you take a look at the arguments put forward by Mass Proletariat as well as Anti-Imperialism.org on this topic, and at least consider the wider implications of what this stuff means.","created_utc":1516566921,"score":19,"subreddit":"communism"}

I have spoken to members of that organisation who seriously consider what you think of Stalin to be the most important political battle in Britain. This is simply wrong.\n\nThe most important battle lies in what people think of the imperialist Labour Party and opposing those opportunists seeking to bring the working class back into the Labour Party despite having already split from them.\n\nYour stance on Labour is more important than your stance on Stalin.\n\nNot pretending the USSR was perfect is in fact the only way to defend it.

National Socialism in the end helped the German ethnically Caucasian bourgeoisie and Hitler's sycophants at the expense of basically everyone else in the country. \n\nHitler had workers' rights smashed. One of the first things he did was exterminate unions. He shamelessly manipulated his people into war in the name of his insane beliefs of \"Aryan destiny\" to dominate the world, and in the end all he built was just temporary. By 1946 Germany was in ruins and in a worse state with poorer living standards than pre WWII. \n\nStalin, meanwhile, had people killed for the greater good of the proletariat, the common people of his nation. It wasn't in the name of primitive, backwards racism, but so his nation could industrialize quickly without opposition by Kulaks and political opposition. Russia's development had been stunted by isolation and stubborn feudalism under Tsarist autocracy. \n\nUnder Stalin the USSR became one of the most powerful and technologically advanced countries of the world, with incredible progress in living standards, and basically defeated Germany even though they weren't quite prepared to do so in the beginning they would have stood no chance if not for his Five year plans. These gains were mostly permanent. Stalin did not destroy his nation like Hitler did through insane policies. He shrewdly controlled all opposition, but to the end benefit of the proletariat. \nAfter Khrushchev the USSR became steadily more revisionist, until it's eventual collapse under Gorbachev. Living standards declined throughout the 1990s in post - Soviet Russia and so did the economy. \n\n\nMao united China and his policies eventually improved living standards, though unfortunately some of his policies failed due to unforeseen factors. \n\n","created_utc":1516613347,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

While I hesitate to presume what would be counted as good sources in this subreddit, I do recommend some of Langley Esquire's vidcasts on Japanese politics, especially those featuring Prof. Michael Cucek, if only for a more nuanced understanding of the factional politics in Japan.\n\nCulminated with the head of the DP telling their candidates to join the Party of Hope (LDP with a environmentalist spin and an even more dog whistling leader than Abe). Party of Hope only wanted to receive candidates that toe the party line about revising Article 9 and Koike deciding not to even run for PM took a lot of the wind out of Party of Hope's chances of  upsetting the LDP.\n\nThe JCP and JLP then threw their support around the new Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, giving up some districts to consolidate the vote against the LDP allowing the new party to become the only large opposition to the LDP in the Diet. \n\nThe LDP and their Junior Coalition partner the Komeito still possess a significant supermajority in the Diet. However, given the national fervor against revising the constitution, and the fact that there needs to be a plebiscite (IIRC, 75% majority needed to pass and right now there is close to 70% opposition to Constitutional revision) to approve any amendments, there shouldn't be to great of a change Abe can make prior to 2020. \n\nFor reference, in the Lower House \n\nLDP: 283, Komeito: 29 (312 total)   vs  CDP: 54  Hope: 51  JCP: 12 Japan Restoration Party: 11  Liberal Party: 2 Social Democrats : 2  Independents: 11 (Totaling 152 Opposition Diet Members ; of which the 63 DMs of the Hope Party and Japan Restoration Party are more closely aligned with the LDP than with the rest of the opposition).\n\nUpper House \n\nLDP: 124 Komeito: 25  Kokoro: 1 (150) vs DP: 42  JCP: 11  Restoration: 11 Social Democrats-Liberal Coalition: 6  CDP: 6   Hope: 3  Energize: 2  Okinawa Whirlwind: 2  People's Voice: 2 Independents: 2 (Totaling 92 opposition members).

I don't think it's worthwhile to wear out our throats over her candidacy or various eclectic positions.

As shocking as it may sound, the farewell letter when he left for Congo fell on the people's head like a bomb. They believed that they had Che so \"for them\", and they welcomed him so warmly, that abandoning everything that connected him to Cuba like he did was almost tearing off an arm of them. Camilo's untimely death had already been felt in the same way. They did not feel it as a betrayal, or I would not have seen so many pictures, graffiti, car stickers, and Guevara's books, and that a person displeased with betrayal would certainly not have it. Che even knew that. In his memoirs of the struggle in the Congo, he identifies the problem and makes a self-criticism about it, for the Cubans who were in the company, and who fought side by side, no longer had the same relationship as before at all levels personal or military). They seemed a little more distant, so to speak.\n\nFidel was a unique figure in the history of humanity, and I do not say it in a generic way, as any of us is. As someone told me once and I'll never forget, that entire island was fidelist, and the best were communists **and** fidelists. The honest, sincere, caring manifestations of the population by Fidel is difficult to find anywhere in the world. I think everyone here knew of his last wish, which was to prevent any state policy of \"personality cult\" (making it clear here how I repudiate the idea that something like this exists in socialist experiences). But you can not force houses and shops to stick posters on your windows and walls. That factories make the effort to hang a huge poster outside with some edifying quote from the Comandante. That a store printed some low-quality and b/w pictures of him to stick to one of the columns, or a house, that has been heavily stranded over the years, stick a paper printed in the Word [which was probably all he had to demonstrate] with the words *\"Yo soy Fidel... \u00bfY tu, que \u00e9res?\"*\n\nThey see Ra\u00fal as a good statesman, with good political leadership, but distant. In part of the people themselves, but what they passed on to me was something like Kim Il Sung did, to inspect the factories, to visit the fields, to live the country on the skin. This they do not feel that Ra\u00fal does, although I do not tell that part of this perception is the inevitable comparison with Fidel. We may argue that it is a bit unfair, but we must not forget that it is the field of feeling and not logical rationalization.\n\nI'm not sure if I could grasp enough clues for noting a difference based on age. Definitely it must be important at some level, for people who lived the special period. But I would like to also include the positions they held and hold at work, that I think could lead to a more solid panel.","created_utc":1516676146,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

There is a chair of Marxist studies at the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Havana. However, they do not republish Marx, Engels, Lenin, Rosa, etc., for twenty years now, more or less. When much, small editions with fragments of the most important works. In one hand, I found a magazine called \"Marx ahora\" (Marx now), edition of 2016. I suppose it is still in operation. On the other hand, three essays were cuban, three were brazilian, three french, one was italian... So it was not totally or at least mostly Cuban. There is this one publisher, called Editorial Ciencias Sociales, that should be publishing what we're looking for. But for some reason they're not keeping it up to what would be ideal. I did, in fact, found the famous book from Dr. Walter Rodney, *How Europe underdeveloped Africa*, in an old books store, edition of 2011, for the cheapest you can imagine, and in Brazil we have no edition available. There was even this time when I was having dinner with my mom and this cuban girl (around 30 years, so you can all know where we stand here) that doesn't seem to like socialism and marxism very much. When my mother said she couldn't understand racism and I explained from a marxist approach, the cuban girl totally agreed with it. That lead me to believe that maybe they can be already learning some Marx without knowing it, by having an education oriented to a proletarian and communist perspective. I mean, she told me once that she had to study economy (administration course at the University of Havana) and they had books called \"the political economy of capitalism\", and by her disgust of that reading I assume it was a critical one.\n\nSo, to sum everything up, I had a hard time trying to fit the country's Marxist study and production, and left with a sensation of failure about this. Maybe I looked the other way, instead of the University, but altough I understand that space to be center of the most refined Marxist thought, I hoped to find it much more widespread in the population.","created_utc":1516678586,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Kellen_der_Heide","body":"First of all I appreciate your honesty, and I can't speak for everyone.\n\nBut to adress your points: Why is it so bad about praising the leaders of communism? Lenin laid the foundation to indistrialising the former Russian Empire from a feudalist backwater to a superpower. Castro and Guevara freed their people from the dictatorship of Batista and made sure that every cuban had enough to live. Sankara made his country independent of food imports and reformed society so women could be free. Allende broke the US-monopoly on copper and stood against imperialism. The list goes on.\n\nBut you also have to acknowledge the fact that all this is near impossible without revolution. And unless the bourgeosie is dissolving itself peacefully, which would be ideal for everyone but sadly is utopian, you can only achieve that goal through violent revolution.\n\nWas the famine in the ukraine Stalin's fault? One could, rightly so I think, criticise the fast collectivisation, but also you have to look at the unwillingness of the kulaks to take part in the process. Did the cultural revolution in China have to be so bloody? Most likely no but if you look at the circumstances and chinese society at that time you'd see the need for it. (MLM comrades feel free to correct me on this one as I don't know so much about Maoism). \n\nYou could criticise on and on, but it should always be dialectical. Saying \"you hate billionaires but Kim Jong Un is one, ownd you!\" is just not a good argument. Look at the situation the DPRK is in: It had nowhere near the massive help the south had rebuilding its cities and infrastructure. Almost every city was levelled. Around 20% of the population had died in the war. It's been under constant embargo from almost every country since the end of the war. But the stance against US-imperialism is still strong. Now, there is some legitimate criticism of Juche (that I won't go into here) but considering the situation of the country I think they're all doing the best they can. [There is a great podcast out there, Citations Nedded, that takes a look at how the DPRK is portrayed in western media](https://soundcloud.com/citationsneeded/episode-02-the-north-korea-memory-hole) you should listen to, if you have the time.\n\nThe TL;DR of my post would be: Criticise where it's needed, using marxist method, but also look with pride at what people can achieve for the cause.

Learn to read between the lines and when complaining about the \"Kims\" is a way to get published at all rather than a serious part of the analysis and you'll be fine.\n\nRegardless, it just depends on what you're looking for specifically, because of the democratic movement in South Korea there's now a lot of decent history of the colonial era up to the overthrow of the US puppet dictatorship, some good history about North Korea up to the late 80s, and good labor history of SK through neo-liberalism and the present. There's nothing of value about North Korea today so you'll have to piece together the story and the left has no real interest in writing works like Brun and Hersh's *Socialist Korea* anymore.

{"author":"intlnews","body":"&gt; Basically do you view \u201cgender\u201d as a personal and individual choice or as a system that oppresses a class of (female) people and some, to a much lesser degree, male people?\n\nI would say gender is not a personal or individual choice but is rather something socially constructed. The division of society between \"private\" and \"public\" is inherent within the development of capitalism and led the \"male\" to be identified with the \"public\" and the \"female\" to be identified with the \"private\"/\"domestic.\" Women are within a class, the working class or proletariat, and are not a class in and of themselves. This does not mean they are not oppressed. Because of the ideals of gender foisted upon them, they either have privilege (like White males) or are oppressed. There is undoubtedly a capitalist patriarchy, without question. Class oppression interconnects with racism, sexism, and transphobia, to name a few. They are used by the capitalist class to divide people. There must be unification across the ranks of the oppressed, against the oppressors, the capitalist class, the bourgeoisie. And yes, those in the bourgeoisie are broadly straight White males, with some peppering of \"color\" to supposedly appease the masses. G. William Domhoff, not a Marxist or radical but a well-through progressive sociologist, has written about the latter and how it does not change the underlying system.\n\nNow to turn to [Rachel's talk](https://dgrnewsservice.org/civilization/patriarchy/gender/end-of-gender-revolution-not-reform/).\n\n&gt; In the first definition, gender, often called \u201cgender identity\u201d is a personal, individual quality possessed by each person. Gender identity is a subjectize perception by an individual of their position on a spectrum between masculine and feminine, which are both neutral attributes, politically. Gender is performed outwardly through choice of markers or symbols like demeanor, body language, aesthetic choices like hair, clothing, presence or absence of makeup, pronoun. These outward markers are what govern whether an individual regards you as male or female upon meeting you or interacting with you. Each person has an innate gender identity, characterized with the words \u201cmasculine\u201d or \u201cfeminine\u201d or in between which is independent of their biological sex. Each person is born with a biological sex (male, female, intersex) which is also apolitical in this definition. Sex and gender are not necessarily connected. The fact that it\u2019s a binary system in the dominant culture. The fact that upon birth you are socialized as either masculine or feminine...Generally, that\u2019s seen as the primary gender oppression in this definition of gender. That system punishes anyone who doesn\u2019t conform to either one of those binary options. It follows that this oppresses both women and men. It oppresses whoever is put into either one of those boxes, no matter why they\u2019re put into it or what happens to them.\n\nThis is undoubtedly the \"popular\" view of gender. I would say that /u/Communist47 as a point that there should be more scientific research. The idea that the brain has no sex is compelling. I remember it from my days taking political theory in the past. I think a potential problem with the above definition is it ignores historical changes over time. All history is about class struggle and that connects completely to the changing nature of gender as foisted upon society, changing the roles of certain individuals within society itself. Communist and socialist movements have done what they can to counteract these trends, sometimes better than others. In Cuba, in more recent years there has been tremendous progress for those of the LGBTQ+ community (which I sometimes just call the non-binary community). I've read that this community is also active in pressing for progressive change in Venezuela as part of the continuing Bolivarian Revolution as well.\n\n&gt; The second definition: Gender is a hierarchical system which maintains the subordination of females as a class to males through force. Gender is a material system of power which uses violence and psychological coercion to exploit female labor, sex, reproduction, emotional support, etc, for the benefit of males.\n\nI think this definition has promise. However, I think it doesn't emphasize the centrality of class. Yes, gender can be a hierarchical system but that is within the capitalist system. A Black woman, lets say, in the U$, would be oppressed through systemic racism, sexism, and classism, the latter as a member of the proletariat. However, the latter is central. Class oppression interlinks with other forms of oppression, which serves as a \"material system of power which uses violence and psychological coercion\" but not to benefit \"males\" generally but the capitalist class, which is almost exclusively male. \n\n&gt; Gender is not natural or voluntary, since a person is not naturally subordinate and no one chooses to be subordinated. Biological sex is a physical feature of each person, and those deemed female upon birth are socialized by the culture into femininity. In this definition, femininity is defined as ritualized displays of submission to males.\n\nThere is no doubt that gender is foisted upon people, and is a form of gender oppression, as you could put it. \n\n&gt; Because without patriarchy there would be no need for gender.\n\nThe problem with a phrase like this as it doesn't recognize that patriarchy is an inherent part of capitalism. The effects of this is something that a well-manner socialist state would consider bourgeois and work to eradicate by any means necessary, within their society. \n\n&gt; So we start with individualism: On the liberal side, gender is seen as a personal individual quality, and thusly politically neutral.\n\nI don't think that anything in society is ever \"politically neutral.\" Everything is interconnected, especially in a capitalist society.\n\n&gt; With liberal environmentalism we see this individualism as the supposed ability of individuals to effect change just by changing themselves. \u201cI\u2019m going to buy something different, I\u2019m going to wear hemp clothing, I\u2019m going to reduce my carbon footprint and that\u2019s going to help get rid of this system, or change this system, that\u2019s causing environmental destruction in the first place.\u201d\n\nThis is the primary philosophy of many of the Gang Green or big environmental groups. This is why I don't attend any of their worthless marches anymore. While they protested and said that Obama should stop the Keystone XL pipeline, he had already built the southern half and was applauding TransCanada as a great company! Those groups are such a joke. They think that the Democrats will save the day, but instead they will cause the planet to crash and burn even more than the climate deniers, as they will not implement the systemic change needed to over come the climate catastrophe.\n\n&gt; Gender is class oppression of females.\n\nGender is part of class oppression of women, but is not class oppression in and of itself as I've previously explained. /u/Calabar_King and /u/liverb pointed this out as well. I think /u/SkillsLikeNobody makes a good point, but I think we must move beyond the binary of \"male\" and \"female.\"\n\n&gt; We\u2019ll go over gender according to radical feminists, and I\u2019ll talk about the class issues as opposed to individualism in a second, but first I have this quote: \u201cIt\u2019s become popular in some activist circles to embrace notions from postmodernism, and that includes the idea that gender is somehow a binary. Gender is not a binary. It is a hierarchy. It is global in its reach, it is sadistic in its practice, and it is murderous in its completion. Just like race, and just like class.\" \nGender demarcates the geopolitical boundaries of patriarchy\u2014which is to say, it divides us in half. That half is not horizontal\u2014it is vertical. And in case you missed this part, men are always on top.\u201d\n\nI don't think that gender alone demarcates boundaries of patriarchy, but it is interconnected with one's class, race, sexual orientation, and many other characteristics (and modes of oppression).\n\n&gt; ...for radicals, gender itself is oppression. I\u2019ll repeat that: Without oppression, there can not be gender. They are one and the same when it comes to sex oppression of females.\n\nI would say there is gender oppression. I would say that without capitalism and in a socialist society, ultimately a communist world, such oppression could end, certainly.\n\n&gt; For radical feminists, gender is the chain, and patriarchy is the ball, and it\u2019s cuffed to the ankle of every female person born.\n\nI would say that class oppression is the chain, with gender, race, and other oppressions forming the links. Capitalist patriarchy is part of what holds women down, without a doubt.\n\n&gt; Gender...is a class condition created by a brutal arrangement of power\n\nIt is a form of oppression within the capitalist system.\n\n&gt; ... I have not endured the oppression and abuse that goes along with being a marginalized racial class.\n\nBlacks, Whites, and indigenous people are races, but not classes. The bourgeoisie and proletariat are classes.\n\n&gt; For radicals, gender is maintained through force. Gender is a material system of power which uses violence and psychological coercion to exploit female labor, sex, reproduction, emotional support, for the benefit of men.\n\nCapitalism is this system of power, not gender, and gender is part of what makes such a system possible.\n\n&gt; Rape culture, right along with female poverty, lack of education, the trafficking of our bodies \u2014it\u2019s maintained through material structures.\n\nIt is maintained as an element of the capitalist patriarchal system.\n\n&gt; My personal feelings towards individuals has nothing to do with my political analysis of what that definition of gender means for all of us, and for people as a class.\n\nOnce again, gender is not a class and neither is race.","created_utc":1516927436,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"WildAppearance","body":"Sure. Without going so far as to categorize Afro-pessimism as a nihilistic form of thought, Wilderson's emphasis on separating critique/analysis from action does remind me intensely of a lot of nihilist thinkers. I can still appreciate a lot of nihilist thinkers, I think there is something to be said for taking a step back and taking in the \"fullness of the problem,\" but where nihilists lose me -- and Wilderson at least -- is to make that practice its whole own body of thought, to separate thought from action and to just think about the problem.\n\nI don't know if you use FB but Bruce Dixon shared this article to his page and it sparked a lot of discussion where he clarified some his points. He makes clear that he doesn't reject all of intersectional thought or Afro-pessimist thought -- he just sees that aspect and sees that it's not entirely helpful for movements. (Nihilists often have highfalutin' political ideas and broad-ranging critiques but wash their hands of what to do). It's also fair to point out that Dixon is a fairly old-school Marxist and tends to limit his theoretical interests to what can be practically picked up by movements and applied. He is not super-interested in ideas that don't have a clear application or implication for strategy. He is all about that dialectical unity of theory and practice.","created_utc":1516989656,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

What some french writers like Sartre knew seems to me to make sense ... people will not revolt unless they can see a better path, a new way to put into the place of the old one; that seem to me indeed the only reason why the french revolution took place, or cuba, or haiti for the matter; the idea that we can do better than what we have, that we can rule ourselves. Not so was for the jews in concentration camps, the negros in the US, or the people during south african apartheid. If you do not have has population something to aim for, you will not rise to it at all. Far more risky, as the financial times pointed a while ago, is that the US might be at some point military run; as for example, take a look at brazil, chile or argentina in the 80s for the matter. There is really no limit to the amount of injustice the people can take; christians famously elevated pain as a fundamental shaper of conscience, mexicans developed these days a cult for mother death ... \n\naccording to the financial times:\n\"This should give pause at a time when a June Gallup poll shows that while only 12 per cent of Americans have confidence in Congress, and only 32 per cent in the president, a whopping 72 per cent have \u201ca great deal\u201d of faith in the military. I guess I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when a long-time source of mine, behavioural economist Peter Atwater, released an investor note in mid-August pointing out these numbers, and suggesting that markets and experts were naive to dismiss entirely the possibility of an American coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.

This publication offers a unique analysis of politics, art, history and current events that you won\u2019t find anywhere else. Though organizations like Vice, TheYoungTurks and DemocracyNow wear the disguise of radical counter-culture, their production comes up short and embodies the same imperialist, capitalist propaganda that you will find at MSNBC, FOX and CNN.\n\nOur publication seeks to be something different. Our goal is simple and straightforward: the complete and utter destruction of capitalism. We dream of a world founded not in corporate greed and death, but in love and generosity. We dream of a world where everyone has a home, a family, a meal on their plate, and a sense of community, no matter who they are or where they were born. We dream of a world without war, hunger, or poverty; a world without pollution, patriarchy or prejudice.\n\nAll around us it feels like the fabric of our world is being torn apart. The inherent contradictions and hypocrisies of our governments are being shoved in our face. The world has never been so interconnected, yet we isolate and alienate ourselves from one another. The Dow Jones climbs to record highs and yet so does income inequality. The writing is on the wall: \u201cThe old world is dying, the new struggles to be born. Now is the time of monsters.\u201d\n\nWe are guided by the philosophy of Marxism. We inherit a rich cultural tradition of rebellion and democracy that has driven human civilization towards progress and liberty for thousands of years. The 60s and 70s are famous for the counter culture movements that, despite failure, continue to inspire us today. At the same time began the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a sociopolitical movement in China from 1966 until 1976. Launched by Mao Zedong, then Chairman of the Communist Party of China, its stated goal was to preserve 'true' Communist ideology in the country by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society, and to re-impose Maoist thought as the dominant ideology within the Party.\n\nIt is time for a Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of our own\u2026\n\nPrint edition coming soon!","created_utc":1517083579,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

Exploitation with regards to wages happens in any socialist state, no socialist state has abolished this because socialism is a transitional historical period; less surplus labor value is extracted, however nonetheless you will always find exploitation of some kind. Additionally, it is important to note the science of Marxism-Leninism as based on historical and material forces. Marxism accepts that historical stages lead to different stages of development, and all Marxist-Leninists (even Engels) agree that control of capital investment and a mixed economy are ways for Socialist countries to leave feudal periods and enter into economic prosperity.\n\nChina under Deng sought to solve the primary contradiction of the CPC and China: the lack of productive forces, i.e., China had labor power, but no capital. Thus foreign capital has been permitted to invest in the Chinese economy. This has resulted in China lifting 750 million people out of poverty, the only other country that comes close is only near 100 million. Since 1980 the income of the bottom 50% of earners in China has increased by 401%. This is entirely a move made by the CPC to literally lift China out of poverty.

In this case, national capitals as such seize to exist as competition between imperial powers cease to exist as they are jointly valorized by super-exploited colonial labor. All the Marxist arguments against the possibility of a singular capital are valid here (see arguments over the absurdity 'state capitalism'). As Sam Williams points out, it's ridiculous to confuse American hegemony with ultra-imperialism for the precise reason that American hegemony is contingent on the military occupation of Germany and Japan. This is something limited indeed, as all empires must die; American hegemony is real enough, but in the world of Trump on the one hand and Merkel on the other saying \"Europeans must take their own destiny into their own hands\" do you really think this is valid?\n\nOf course, Lenin's theory is not invalidated by American hegemony. While I pointed out it was real but muted, you're focusing too much on competition between imperial powers. What's at the core of the theory is the *division of the world into oppressor and oppressed nations*.

Although you are correct that the Taliban is not Al-Qadea, they knew what bin Laden was selling doing and they fought beside him during the Soviet War. Bin Laden was expelled from Sudan(he lived there since he was expelled from Saudi Arabia) in 1996 and then went to Afganistan because they had offered him and his group sanctuary. It is also true that the Taliban had offered to the US to arrest bin Ladan and extradite him to Qatar to face justice under an Islamic Court, the US didn't take the offer because they wanted their War.\n\nSecondly, I am pretty sure Saudi Arabia has dropped its support for Hamas this year and also that was one of the reasons the GCC moved against Qatar for its continued support of Hamas and the Qataris refused to expel Khaled Mashal the leader of Hamas who lives in Doha.\n\nI saw Hamas has progressive elements in because they are the Democratically elected government of Gaza since 2007 and provides social services for the people of Gaza who have been under an Illegal Israeli Military Blockade since 2007 when Hamas was elected as a party.

{"author":"lenin-the-third","body":"&gt;When I contrasted the Philippines with China, I saw what differentiates China is the legacy of land reform. Land reform gave each Chinese peasant a piece of land. This is the key to cheap labor in China. If you compare the official minimum wage in China and the official minimum wage in, for example, the Philippines today (I don\u2019t know much about India), you cannot see a huge difference. A lot of people in the Philippines live on this minimum wage and they live in poverty. But Chinese workers with more or less the same wage are much better off. Why is that? Mainly because in places like the Philippines, landless peasants are forced out of the countryside, they come to the cities, start to live on the minimum wage, and that wage has to support the whole family. Care of the young, care of the old, all depend on this wage. But the families of Chinese migrant workers, farmers who come to city to make a living do not totally count on their wage. They have land back home. Raising youth and caring for the old in the countryside have almost zero cost. So, it comes to the point that if the process of working class reproduction is carried out in the countryside, the cost is reduced substantially. But if you move to an urban center as a landless peasant, the expenses of housing, schooling of the youth, caring for the old and so on are much higher. In the Chinese countryside, people in their 60s, 70s and even 80s still work their fields and gardens. They\u2019re self-sufficient. They have their own house, their own land. Even if they are not able to work, they have cell phones. They call up somebody to plant, plough or harvest their land. They just manage a little bit. So old people are not a burden for young people. That is the key to understand cheap labor in China. And what made this possible is the Chinese Revolution of 1949. Without this basis, China would not have this kind of cheap labor.

I think they have a very good conception of the hegemonic struggle against the bourgeois class and are really winning the cultural and political war for state territory, the next step is to really force their way into the economy. I think it's a promising situation, especially since even the highest echelons of the PSUV still identify that parasitic capitalism dominates the economic system, and is still omnipresent in the country, needing to be rooted out. This is good precisely because they have positioned themselves as a lever of class struggle. The petty bourgeois elements of the PSUV have been somewhat discredited in the recent months as it is clear that there is no need to cross the aisle and appeal to the opposition for the sake of government unity. I know that a year ago they were even considering ousting the PCV from the coalition and cracking down on other proletarian elements, but this faction has been, for the moment, defeated as they have demonstrated that it is the proletarian elements which are the closest allies to the revolution. Opportunists must still be rooted out, and eventually there will need to be a qualitative break between the petty bourgeois social democrats and proletarian socialists in the Bolivarian movement, but so far the proletariat seems to have the wind to their backs approaching this critical struggle.

Take China for example:\n\n&gt;When imperialism launches a war of aggression against such a country, all its various classes, except for some traitors, can temporarily unite in a national war against imperialism. At such a time, the contradiction between imperialism and the country concerned becomes the principal contradiction, while all the contradictions among the various classes within the country (including what was the principal contradiction, between the feudal system and the great masses of the people) are temporarily relegated to a secondary and subordinate position. So it was in China in the Opium War of 1840, the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 and the Yi Ho Tuan War of 1900, and so it is now in the present Sino-Japanese War. \n&gt;But in another situation, the contradictions change position. When imperialism carries on its oppression not by war, but by milder means--political, economic and cultural--the ruling classes in semi-colonial countries capitulate to imperialism, and the two form an alliance for the joint oppression of the masses of the people. At such a time, the masses often resort to civil war against the alliance of imperialism and the feudal classes, while imperialism often employs indirect methods rather than direct action in helping the reactionaries in the semi-colonial countries to oppress the people, and thus the internal contradictions become particularly sharp.

It is not \"withheld\" from the proletariat. \n\n&gt; Marxism as a scientific theory seems much harder to debunk, compared to communist ideology\n\nAgain, why are you separating them?\n\n&gt; Like all political ideologies, communism can be debated against, since it is just an idea, but Marxism is a science, and it is impossible to debate against science.\n\nYou can debate again Marxism, sure, but you won't win. Communism is inherently Marxist, without question. Stop saying it isn't.\n\n&gt; Initially, I wanted to ask this question because of how Marxism seems to be irrelevant even in Marxist-Leninist countries, especially those of the modern-day\n\nWhat? Marxism isn't irrelevant in Cuba, China, the DPRK, or any country of the world. It is and will always be relevant!\n\n&gt; I personally have never been to any ML country, but from what I perceive is that the various governments have disregarded Marxism and focused more on communism, whilst the every day citizen is oblivious to both. I have even met people from these countries who are apolitical, whilst a few were even fervently anti-communist.\n\nI guess you've just met a bunch of defectors. Never trust those people with anything. They spout propaganda about the \"horribleness\" of those countries no matter what.\n\n&gt; I would like to imagine that if they understood Marxist theory, they would be pro-communist, but as Marxists, we can generally agree that the way we change the superstructure is by changing the base of society. \n\nUm, you really need to read a lot about Marxism before making any pathetic comments like this. Really.\n\n&gt; We cannot change the ideas and preconceived notions of people by debating them. \n\nYes, we can, for sure.\n\n&gt; Instead, we must transform their material surroundings. \n\nWe can do both.\n\n&gt; This brought me to the question whether teaching Marxism may actually be a futile effort.\n\nTeaching Marxism is always worth it, no matter what.","created_utc":1517254075,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

You can't try to separate Marxism and Communism, they are interconnected.\n\n&gt; Communism is an inherent part of Marxism, the \"leaves\" so to speak, because of historical materialism, the \"roots\". \n\nWell that's not what you said in your original post at all.\n\n&gt; When I asked the question, it was basically \"Marxism in its entirety (including communism), or just Communism?\" \n\nNo, you tried to differentiate between Marxism and Communism, which isn't possible.\n\n&gt; \"Communism\", the word, can refer to the mode of production, or the political ideology. \n\nOk, but it is part of Marxism.\n\n&gt; When I say the political ideology, I am referring to it in a general non-Marxist sense (Wanting to establish communism). Some Anarchists want to establish communism, which means they are communists. \n\nThere is no need to refer to it in a non-Marxist sense. This forum is for Marxists, not for those otherwise.\n\n&gt; The word was after all coined before Marx's time.\n\nI'm not sure if that's even true, but even if it isn't the conception of communism is within and part of Marxist theory.\n\n&gt; But we shouldn't be stuck with pure semantics. I should have asked the question differently (dialectical materialism or not?) In a Marxist sense, there is no difference between Marxism and communism, but there is a difference between dialectical materialism and communism. \n\nI don't think you should have asked the question at all!\n\n&gt; My mistake in wording the question may have been due to associating the word \"marxism\" to primarily dialectical materialism, since this is what differentiates Marxists from other currents of non-marxist communism.\n\nSince Communism is an \"inherent part of Marxism\" as you admit in your comment then it doesn't even make sense to talk about \"non-marxist communism\" because it doesn't exist.\n\n&gt; Not saying I'm right or wrong, but the way I interpret and understand Marxism is by comparing it to a tree. There are roots and they lead to leaves. This after all seems to be in line with the dialectical materialist idea that forms of higher stages come about as a synthesis from the dialectic process of lower stages.\n\nOh boy. Well, then, you need to read a lot more to construct that tree for yourself.\n\n&gt; When it comes to the Marxist view on theology, it technically isn't atheistic, but it would require a materialistic outlook on reality, where God, or gods, is made of the same substance as the universe and is non-interventionist.\n\nOk, but there are Christian communists, Muslim communists, and those who adapt Marxism to work in tandem with religion. I'm not saying I agree with them, but they do exist. Also, Marx himself was deeply influenced by theology, which is something no one should forget.\n\n&gt; I have read about a sect of Christians who are materialists, but the vast majority of religions and religious people have an idealist outlook on reality. \n\nPerhaps, but you can be Marxist and have religious beliefs.\n\n&gt; I myself was a Marxist and a Muslim at one point.\n\nProving my above point.\n\n&gt; P.S.

Some estimates are that at least 60,000 deaths can be attributed to Condor, and possibly more.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/communism/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1517310534,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

When I went to college, I was exposed to the Identity Politics liberalism masquerading as \"leftism\", and immediately hated it. I'm ashamed to admit I adopted some far-right views; frequenting 4chan /pol/ didn't help either. \n\nWhen I got involved with right-wing groups, I realized those people are even dumber, more petty and narrow minded than the liberal IdPol people I despised. \n\nIn my Econ class I made friends with an M-L. Talking with him I realized he disliked IdPol just as much as I did. He also had a much more scientific and probable explanation for society's problems than the judeo-muslamic conspiracy. He introduced me to Parenti's work, which explains how fascism is just a tool, used by wealthy elites to serve their interests. \n\nSometimes I wonder if the ruling class intentionally created this IdPol obsession in the colleges, precisely in order to incite the right-wing reaction.

Land went to his supporters with no knowledge of farming and thousands of white farmers fled.  The violent farm seizures saw Zimbabwe forfeit its status as the bread basket of Africa and led to a collapse of many industries that depended on agriculture. Among those were paper mills, textile firms, leather tanners and clothing companies.\n\nTypical bourgeois propaganda BS. It was more the sanctions than anything else. \n\n&gt; Now some white farmers are starting to reclaim their land. \"White commercial farmers, like all other Zimbabweans, could apply for land from the Government and join the queue or go into joint ventures,\" Mnangagwa told a former white commercial farmer during a recent visit to Namibia... Property rights expert Lloyd Mhishi, a senior partner in the law firm Mhishi Nkomo Legal Practice, said although Mnangagwa spoke about compensating farmers whose land was expropriated, he did not give specifics and title deeds of the former white farmers had no legal force after repossession.\n\nSo the reversal of the land reform is still in the process.\n\n&gt; Independent economist John Robertson, a former Advisor to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, said, however, that any idea of compensation should be dropped and former white commercial farmers should get back to their land and resume work. \"I'd rather see them get back their land and start farming again than paid out and emigrating. We need their skills. If people who oppose that idea could be just successful, where have they been for the past 20 years?\" he said.\n\nI don't think these settlers should be given land at all!

{"author":"intlnews","body":"So, \"Nujin Derik...the commander of the Women\u2019s Protection Units in Afrin, Syria\" is showing that these Kurds (the SDF/YPG/YPG which are really part of the PKK) really want U$ imperialism, which is disgusting.\n\n&gt; For more than a week, my home in northwestern Syria has been under a full-scale assault by the Turkish Army and thousands of Turkish-aligned Islamist jihadists. Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been threatening this invasion for a very long time. The Turkish Army has been targeting our villages with mortars and artillery for many months now.\n\nThere's no doubt about that, but you are almost acting like you are innocent here.\n\n&gt; I and my fellow members of the Kurdish Women\u2019s and People\u2019s Protection Units, often known as the Y.P.J. and Y.P.G., have fought hard for years to keep the Islamic State out of this autonomous region of Syria known as Rojava. We endured Turkey\u2019s barrages and avoided returning fire, even after civilian casualties, so as not to provide a pretext for this invasion.\n\nYour presence in that region was in and of itself a \"pretext for invasion\"! Come on now.\n\n&gt; But Mr. Erdogan has nevertheless unleashed airstrikes, tanks and troops on this area that was once a relative island of peace in this war-torn country.\n\nWhat? It was a \"relative island of peace\" BEFORE Rojava existed. Since then, there has been conflict.\n\n&gt; One would imagine the international community and especially the United States, which has been more than happy to partner with us in the fight against the Islamic State, would firmly oppose such an unprovoked attack executed in the name of racial hatred \u2014 Mr. Erdogan has stated his intention to commit ethnic cleansing of Afrin\u2019s Kurdish population, or, as he says, to give the region to its \u201creal owners\u201d \u2014 but instead, it has been greeted largely with silence, and therefore tacitly condoned.\n\nSo, now you are sad that you can't depend on the imperialists. Why did you even trust them? You could have allied with the Syrians or Russians, but no, that wasn't in your nature to do so.\n\n&gt; Does the Trump administration now care about nothing but its own immediate tactical interests? Wavering messages or calls for \u201ccaution\u201d will not be enough. In addition to exerting real pressure on its Turkish ally, the United States should press for a no-flight zone over Afrin and the rest of Rojava. Leaders in Britain, France and elsewhere must also take a moral stand and demand a stop to this carnage.\n\nSo, basically you are saying the U$ should be MORE involved in Syria in order to stop carnage? That doesn't even make sense!\n\n&gt; The Turkish Army has been training the most extreme Islamist gangsters it could find as part of the so-called Free Syrian Army that is part of their assault, including members of the fascist Gray Wolf death squads and Qaeda affiliates, with high-tech weaponry purchased from the United States, Britain and Germany. They are being sent into our country backed by F-16 aircraft, German-made Leopard tanks and regular Turkish soldiers.\n\nDo you forget that the Free Syrian Army was once backed by the U$. I guess that would displease your patron to say that.\n\n&gt; Yet Mr. Erdogan calls us terrorists, asserting that we and the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party that he has warred with in Turkey are identical. The hypocrisy of this transparent justification for his invasion is astounding. Our forces have led the fight against the true terror represented by the Islamic State \u2014 even while Turkey provided it support and its oil was sold in Turkey.\n\nHe is right that the PKK and your organization are one and the same. However, I'd rather call you imperialist footsoldiers who are illegally occupying sovereign Syrian territory than terrorists.\n\n&gt; Now Turkey is allying itself with jihadists and backing them with NATO weaponry to attack us. Is the world really willing to believe we are terrorists because we share the Kurdish freedom movement\u2019s goals of democracy, environmental protection and women\u2019s liberation?\n\nCome on now, drop the damn charade. The Kurdish movement  is not about democracy, environmental protection or women's protection. That's only what favorable media say. It is basically an utter lie, as Rojava would not exist without help from imperialists. End of story.\n\n&gt; We proudly admit we support these ideas, as do members of the Kurdish movement in Turkey and elsewhere. But our forces have been focused on the fight against the Islamic State, one in which we\u2019d rather have had Turkey as an ally, not an enemy.\n\nWait, so you would ally with the fascists in Turkey led by Erdogan? Gosh, I guess allying with neo-Ottomanites who suppress their population is ok with you. Ugh, disgusting.\n\n&gt; Do Western powers now believe that too strong a commitment to their own professed democratic ideals is terrorism? Mr. Erdogan, on the other hand, is an enemy of women, whom he has called \u201chalf persons,\u201d and the views of his fundamentalist minions are even worse.\n\nNo, Western powers don't want a war with Turkey, as it is crucial to imperial plans to destabilize the mideast. Now you are saying that Erdogan hates women, yet earlier you said you'd be willing to have Turkey as an ally rather than an enemy! Yikes.\n\n&gt; But just as female fighters were instrumental in the defense of Kobane and the liberation of Raqqa \u2014 where a major objective was the freeing of the Yazidi women the jihadists had taken there as slaves \u2014 so we will resist invaders here in Afrin.\n\nHere we go in trumpeting your little horn. Keep playing your little violin. No one with sense is even listening. \n\n&gt;  There\u2019s much worth fighting for. Until the Turkish invasion we had been able to maintain Afrin as a haven for anyone fleeing the terror of the civil war. We worked to develop our own democratic institutions.\n\nWhat, you are inherently anti-democratic by relying on imperialist and Zionist support to exist. Stop acting like you are progressive. It is an utter lie.\n\n&gt; Though poor and largely without outside aid, we have shared what we have with refugees, to the point where the region\u2019s population ballooned in size.\n\nOh boy, no you are trying to call yourself pro-refugee. I think Venezuela, which has accepted thousands of Syrian refugees better goes into that category than you clowns.\n\n&gt; In keeping with our philosophy of democratic confederalism, we established local councils so that all can participate in the decisions affecting their neighborhoods and communities. We hold independently monitored elections and ensure that women and all ethnic groups are strongly represented in governance. Our democratic system is increasingly the opposite of Turkey\u2019s, where President Erdogan is crushing dissent and centralizing more power every day.\n\nHere it goes with your silly democratic confederalism. It is a system created thanks to imperialism and is not a rosy picture that you treat it as, not at all. \n\n&gt; We have lost thousands of our brothers and sisters in the war against the Islamic State, and if this invasion continues, it will be only a matter of time before the jihadist remnants return to gain control of places we had liberated.\n\nThat may be true, but it might be part of the point of the invasion after all!\n\n&gt; And Turkey\u2019s forces themselves, allied as they are with extremist groups, pose a serious threat to our Assyrian and Armenian Christian and Yazidi communities. Turkey\u2019s planes are killing children and civilians and destroying our villages. Those who had taken refuge here are fleeing and have no haven left.\n\nThe Syrian government agrees with you that the invasion is destructive, but when have you looked to work with them? I haven't seen any indication of that at all!\n\n&gt; We are asking the Western powers to act on their principles. Why are you not condemning a flagrant and unprovoked assault on the very men and women who stood shoulder to shoulder with you against the darkness of the Islamic State? Now a different evil, that of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s increasingly undemocratic Turkey, aims to destroy our fledgling democracy. And this time, it\u2019s claiming to act in your name.\n\nOh god, asking the Western powers to \"act on their principles.\" You are basically calling for imperialism. Stop acting like it is humanitarian. Syria should solve its own problems with intervention from the dang imperialists.","created_utc":1517358307,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

Anti-communists aren't criticising the USSR for revisionism or mechanistic application of dialectics which paved the way for that revisionism, but lack of liberty, genocide, lack of free speech for nazis, bureaucracy, freedom to exploit, bread lines, 1984 myths, and etc.\n\nAnd if you have not yet realised that anti-communism is the norm, especially in imperialist countries such as the UK, I don't know how to help you with that problem.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou're missing the forest for the trees and your original point is objectively wrong, sorry.","created_utc":1517413564,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"BurdBurdSenpai","body":"Good questions. Most of the left leaning parties here in the Netherlands are not nearly leftist enough for us. They advocate capitalism with socialist characteristics. They are not real socialists, let alone communists. We want to give communism a better name by reaching out to the communities and educating them on Marxism and such. Our organisation will mainly strive to make a more leftist environment, paving the way for the revolution. \n\nAs for your question about the Benelux; sure, it may seem random, but we figured that combining the Dutch, Belgian, and Luxembourgian communists will give us a larger base to work from.

A lot more former democrats are joining third parties, the anti-war and anti-capitalist green party got more votes than they ever have, the DSA is growing insanely fast for a 3rd party in the US, and as a result of all of these more and more people are being introduced to socialistic ideas.\n\nOn the other hand Trump himself is a unifying force for democrats, we won't know for sure what they'll unify behind until November but I doubt it'll be the Bernie crowd. He also directly condemned Cuba as \"communist\" and Venezuela as \"socialist\" dictatorships last night  so that's certainly not good news when it comes to our interactions with people who listen to Trump. \n\nAs for policy a lot of his following want(ed?)
