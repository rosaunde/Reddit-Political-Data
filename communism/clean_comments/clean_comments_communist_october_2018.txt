Both countries pledged to resolve their problems by bilateral negotiations and to forgo armed conflict for a period of ten years. It effectively normalized relations between Poland and Germany, which were previously strained by border disputes arising from the territorial settlement in the Treaty of Versailles. Germany effectively recognized Poland's borders and moved to end an economically damaging customs war between the two countries that had taken place over the previous decade.\n\n***\n\n**Anglo\u2013German Naval Agreement**\n\nThe Anglo\u2013German Naval Agreement of 18 June 1935 was a naval agreement between the United Kingdom and Germany regulating the size of the Kriegsmarine in relation to the Royal Navy. The Anglo\u2013German Naval Agreement fixed a ratio whereby the total tonnage of the Kriegsmarine was to be 35% of the total tonnage of the Royal Navy on a permanent basis. It was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on 12 July 1935.

German\u2013Latvian Non-Aggression Pact was also signed on the same day. Ratifications of the German-Estonian pact were exchanged in Berlin on July 24, 1939 and it became effective on the same day.

The Latvian and Estonian governments, ever suspicious of Soviet intentions, decided to accept a mutual non-aggression pact with Germany. The German\u2013Estonian and German\u2013Latvian Non-aggression pacts were signed in Berlin on June 7, 1939 by Latvian foreign minister Vilhelms Munters and Joachim von Ribbentrop.\n\n***\n\n**Munich Agreement**\n\nThe Munich Agreement, known in Czechoslovakia as the Munich Diktat (Czech: Mnichovsk\u00fd dikt\u00e1t; Slovak: Mn\u00edchovsk\u00fd dikt\u00e1t) or Munich Betrayal (Czech: Mnichovsk\u00e1 zrada; Slovak: Mn\u00edchovsk\u00e1 zrada), was an agreement permitting Nazi Germany's annexation of portions of Czechoslovakia, along the country's borders mainly inhabited by German speakers, for which a new territorial designation, the \"Sudetenland\", was coined. The agreement was signed in the German city of Munich early on 30 September 1938 (although dated 29 September) after being negotiated upon by the major powers of Europe, excluding the Soviet Union.  The purpose of the conference was to discuss the future ownership of the Sudetenland in the face of demands made by Adolf Hitler. The agreement was signed by the government leaders of Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Italy, but not Czechoslovakia, who were not invited to the conference, even though the Sudetenland was of immense strategic importance to Czechoslovakia as most of its border defenses and banks were situated there, as well as heavy industrial districts.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/communism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1538368617,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

This was an opportunity for american capitalists.\nBy rebuilding european economies in a certain manner they ensured that:\n1. Europe would be dependant on the US\n2. The economic conditions in west-europe were such that the masses were not too poor, this way the masses would support the status quo rather than left-wing revolution.\n3. Through their control over europe they would find themselves having tremendous power over the colonies of europe as well.\n\n\nNow, there is no economic interest in rebuilding a country after a \"small\" war such as the wars after WWII have been. Every war waged by the US since 1945 has been a war in which the US attempted to strengthen its hold over the world. Rebuilding the economies of its victims doesnt further that goal. \nLeaving chaos and broken countries is what allows the US to stay on top.\n\n\nIn short; after WWII the US helped certain countries in order to become the top dog. But ever since it became top dog its goal has been to reamin that way, and for that goal helping countries rebuild is not usefull.","created_utc":1538379673,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"DeLaProle","body":"Even the biggest \"tankies\" or \"Stalinists\" don't think Stalin is beyond criticism. Without criticism there is no movement, and this concept is anti-dialectical. The problem is that the majority of criticisms against Stalin consists of liberal nonsense rephrasing the same anti-communist memes they've accumulated throughout various history classes and pop-history trivia then smugly acting as if no communists have ever heard their brilliant regurgitations. Whenever discussing communism liberals are the ones who cannot resist bringing him up. Obviously one cannot expect truly materialist analysis from liberals but after a while one comes to the realization that it is impossible to combat this all of the time. It takes almost no time or effort to repeat or even make up all sorts of claims, but it takes orders of magnitude more effort to refute them. After working all day most people don't have the time or energy to play this game, so a lot of communists on the internet end up resigning to memes in protest (stuff like \"Stalin did nothing wrong\", etc) to almost act as a scarecrow against liberals. This then acts as a great bond of solidarity. As Lenin pointed out, after the death of great revolutionaries the bourgeoisie tries to rehabilitate them in order to blunt their revolutionary spirit. They have done this to Marx and even to Lenin but one person they have not yet have been able to claim is Stalin (and Mao to a somewhat lesser degree). Bourgeois media has sometimes claimed Marx. Liberal socialists try to claim Lenin. If you see someone in a Che shirt you're never sure if it's an actual communist or an edgy liberal. Stalin has not yet shared such a fate; if you witness a leftist speaking even non-negatively of Stalin you know they are a comrade.

It's basically like \"the Economist says the University won't allow the Marxist club so the CCP isn't really communist, they're degenerates just like all actually existing socialism lolz\"\n\nHere's a more nuanced view from another comrade:\n\n&gt; Stories like this are picked up by the Western media in order to push the narrative that China is Marxist and socialist in name only. It is meant to show that China and the CPC are hypocritical and when students actually do what their ideology preaches they are punished. This is a common Western trope that has been employed for generations. It was also used against the Soviet Union and other members of the \"Soviet bloc.\" Many Western socialists swallow it hook, line and sinker. It is the sort of critique that has been used by many leftist opponents of China and other socialist countries.which they consider to be \"deformed\" or \"revisionist.\"\n\n&gt; This is due to a fundamental misunderstanding of how to build socialism after the seizure of state power by a M-L communist party. Once state power is seized in an underdeveloped country like China the immediate and long-term objective is to secure its maintenance in order to construct the material basis for socialism. Without state power socialism will simply revert back to capitalism which is the default sociopolitical and economic system during the era of imperialism. Thus, all efforts must be made to prevent movements that exacerbate conflicts within society that could lead to the loss of state power, sometimes leading to the actual suppression of the working class and its allies (e.g. students) when their actions are focused on issues.that impinge on the unitary rule of the Party and state.\n\n&gt; If left to their own devices these issues can snowball and lead to the fragmentation of social solidarity. Students rallying around economist issues of the working class leads them to actions that oppose the leading role of the Party in state affairs. What then is to keep students and other forces in society from rallying around other divisive issues? Social, economic and environmental justice issues that are the mainstay of the left, Marxist and otherwise, in bourgeois democracies would eventually spread like wildfire, leading to the disruption of social stability which could be exploited by anti-socialist forces attempting to foment a \"color revolution\" which could lead to\"regime change.\" This has happened time and again in practice.\n\n&gt; Such contradictions under socialism must be handled \"in house\"under the leadership and guidance of the Party if state power is to be maintained. Under socialism there must however be mechanisms which allow the state to resolve contradictions among the people. Otherwise they will spin out of control and threaten social stability. China has demonstrated that it does have and utilizes such structures. The unilateral intervention of non-state actors, such as students,in this process is counterproductive and can lead to the exacerbation of contradictions rather than their resolution.","created_utc":1538405521,"score":39,"subreddit":"communism"}

Yoga sutras also gives a metaphor to explain this process. It states that consciousness is like water, at the depth of water is true experience, but if the surface of the water, which is mind(thoughts emotions) is rippled of wavy you can't see through the water, when it becomes calm, you can see through the surface of the water into the depth. In other words, our regular consciousness is false consciousness.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point, you could make the point that if you spend all of your time in a dream world of unity, you are ignoring the facts of poverty, class struggle, etc., but I would argue that this is an incorrect interpretation. In the yoga tradition, one of the most important gods is Shiva the destroyer, transformer. Shiva is supposed to be an anthropomorphization of the process of transformation as it is seen in the physical universe. As you do yoga, and meditate on shiva, or the process of cause and effect (the buddhist equivalent would be karma. In fact, Shaavism and buddhism are extremely similar on many levels), you begin to gain greater awareness of what the appropriate effect of any given cause will be so as to be able to correctly and skillfully apply your effort\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn other words, the entire purpose of yoga isn't some deluded fantasy world, but to gain the most accurate possible interpretation of the world around you.","created_utc":1538431756,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

Naturally, people who are self-proclaimed \"hard-line Marxists\" would dislike people have a slight (or radical) deviation from CommManifesto Communism.\n\nExamples of revisionism:\n\n[De Leonism](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/De_Leonism):\n\nArguably the oldest deviant branch of Communism, predating the Russian Revolution (1890s vs. 1917), De Leonism is a uniquely American form of Communism. It is based on a wildly different interpretation of Das Kapital and the CommManifesto, and instead of the fairly generic Marxist-Leninist worker's revolution, then dictatorship of the proletariat, then Communism achieved, De Leonism advocates for the revolution to occur through the overwhelming power of unions breaking corporate and capitalist dominance, then the implementation of a system which involves democratic decisions made by the heads of the labour syndicates. It's pretty strange and, as I said earlier, it's virtually non-existent outside of the US.\n\n[Posadism](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fourth_International_Posadist):\n\nPosadism is a Trotskyist ideology founded by J. Posadas, and is rarely found outside of South America. It advocates for capitalist nations to destroy each other through nuclear war, then for aliens to come along and aid the workers in the revolution, and for them to help us telepathically communicate with dolphins for some reason.\n\nThere are, of course, less extreme versions of revisionism (you can argue Mao and Tito were revisionist) however I think you get the general gist of what I'm saying.","created_utc":1538496779,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

Opportunism means making needless concessions to the class enemy and ultimately leads to the betraying the working class.\n\nThis can come in many shapes and forms like left opportunism that is not using the space of bourgeois democracy to promote communist ideas and instead acts sectarian but also right opportunism that trusts in bourgeois democracy and only tries to win with reformism, not arming the working class.\n\nThe most dangerous form of opportunism is centrism.\nCentrism means choosing unity over ideological clarity. Centrist will defend other opportunists in the name of party unity and for that reason soon become opportunists themselves. It is the most dangerous as it is a very hidden form of opportunism.\n\nThe main economic basis for revisionism is the labor aristocracy. That is a part of the working class that is bribed with the extra profits of the monopoly-capitalists. This part of the proletariat is much more susceptible to bourgeois influence.\n\nOnly a communist party that does not tolerate revisionists, that means traitors, in its ranks, can lead a successful revolution.

More of that \"enlightened\" centrism bullshit. How typical. Well, that's not what communism is. Communism seeks to eradicate the status quo and build an entirely new system. Communists don't want to be a part of the hideously corrupt system you love so much. \"Willing to work with others\"...and \"making a difference in people's lives\". More liberal taglines. No, communism is not about compromising with the bourgeois and imperialists. Nor is it about false platitudes and postering about \"making a difference\" and patting ourselves on the back when the system remains the same. If we did that, we wouldn't be what we are...we would just be liberals who are two inches \"left\" of our GOP buddies, the other side of the same worthless coin that is liberal and capitalist society.","created_utc":1538531178,"score":13,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"PaxRubrum","body":"Do you really think they care for morals? Let me quote Thomas Joseph Dunning (most people mistaken these words as Karl Marx')\n\nCapital is said \u2026 to fly turbulence and strife, and to be timid, which is very true; but this is very incompletely stating the question. Capital eschews no profit, or very small profit, just as Nature was formerly said to abhor a vacuum. With adequate profit, capital is very bold. A certain 10 per cent. will ensure its employment anywhere; 20 per cent. certain will produce eagerness; 50 per cent., positive audacity; 100 per cent. will make it ready to trample on all human laws; 300 per cent., and there is not a crime at which it will scruple, nor a risk it will not run, even to the chance of its owner being hanged. If turbulence and strife will bring a profit, it will freely encourage both. Smuggling and the slave-trade have amply proved all that is here stated.","created_utc":1538602092,"score":21,"subreddit":"communism"}

Do soldiers feel like good people when they kill extremists? Do Doctors feel good when they save someone's life? I have two things to say about this: A) Good, is subjective. You dont think they're good people because your a communist\/ socialist, a capitalist doesn't think your a good person because your a socialist\/ communist. Being a good person does not have a polygraph test, it's purely based on your opinion. B) We live in a culture that accepts all the faults of capitalism as, \"that's just the way life is\". Under this system, being a good person is someone that positively affects the economy ie) Employs workers, gives them good pay, pay they're taxes, Ect.\n\nI would highly recommend that you dont concern yourself with morality. Morality is purely based on the time period we live in. If your a communist\/ socialist because you think it's more moral, then your a socialist for the wrong reason. Socialsim is a strong economic theory and doesn't need morality to win people over. Socialism will only ever win people over through economics as, if our modern world is the perfect example, many people believe that communism is immoral and they are fine with the microeconomic aspects of capitalism.

As far as I know, every bourgeois I know would call themselves a liberal (albeit in the more narrow sense) and as far as they ever express genuinely believe in the values they espouse. They are generally able to sympathize with the poor, and many often feel the urge to give money to help. That sympathy only goes so far though, and they often have things that they tell themselves, usually either pet-theories or stories, explaining why they deserve what they have. Most are implicitly racist. For example, they might bear no prejudice to a black individual yet at the same time believe that the natural state of Africa is grinding poverty and that the people there choose not to improve their lives. This both supports their choice to \"try to help\" by being charitable and their belief that they deserve wealth and others do not. Many believe that they were indeed the ones who toiled for their wealth. They also tend to view the proletariat in a paternal and condescending way, such that they can at once believe they stand for the betterment of the proletariat while also harboring often open contempt for us, believing that we are suited best living below them. There's this way of looking through you they have, like they know that you and they are there but as though they've written off any kind commonality you might have with them. They bear no ill will towards you yet are subtly disgusted by your presence, and they don't know how to feel given that contradiction and would rather avoid you than have to face it.\n\nThat's kind of how I'd sum up my experience with them.

{"author":"Raestagg","body":"I like the following post that I'd stumbled across on social media a while back:\n\n\"Why does anybody ever trust conspiracy? The very nature of conspiracy is untrustable as a source of motivation, in that it is too dynamic, and does not explain why something would repeat over and over again. The only thing required for a conspiracy to end its chain of influence is a certain focal point in the conspiracy simply decides not to be a part of it or is compromised in some other way. Statistically this can happen too often for conspiracy to be a valuable source of explanation for social phenomena, it does not and cannot explain how things happen constantly enough to achieve the goals of the society in a systemic fashion. The only proper explanation for systemic forces and their transformation is to understand why the people build up the social structures they do because their conditions simply did not allow for another option, or at least not another option that will succeed repeatedly. When a person makes a decision they make it to sustain themselves, to succeed at this they must make a decision within the context of the given mode of how sustenance is produced. This type of historical explanation shows how without fail people will continue to use objects in the same way in mass until social constraints are built around the way the object is used. This runs in a cyclical pattern, where the social constraints maintain the base of production and the base of production shapes the social constraints. The mode of production itself evolves with the evolution of class character, which is another wing of historical materialism. Typically in history class character has evolved with the progress of technology, IE, the changing of class character from Feudal Lords to the Bourgeois, where the Industrialization of land took the tools of production out of the hands of the farmers and moved them to large condensed privately owned factories, with this condensation of production the class character of Feudal lords Transformed into the Bourgeois class character we have today, and the Capital accumulation that comes with it. What conspiracy...is needed to understand this? This is all defined clearly with organic transformations that supersede human choice, in fact supersede human choice in such a strong fashion that they control the entire trajectory of human choice throughout the ages.

{"author":"Cryptonix","body":"Yes, they do.\n\nWe talk a lot about people being adaptable to their environmental conditions. This has plenty to do with one's moral understanding of the world as well. Why would a capitalist believe their position is doing any harm to society? They see nothing but the opportunity to provide products for people to enjoy. They see a growing surplus in their pockets. They see a level of individual autonomy in their position. They see it as an opportunity to provide employment. Capitalism worked for them, why shouldn't it work for anyone else? They take pride in believing they worked hard to achieve their level of success. In many cases, perhaps they did. They don't see private enterprise as exploitative and neither do their employees, most likely.\n\nThe biggest issue that blankets over all of this, however, is that capitalists, and by extension most people living in capitalist societies, do not question their environment from a *materialist* standpoint. How can they? No one talks about it. The mainstream doesn't criticize the roots of capitalism. Plenty of people don't even know what capitalism really is, nor what alternatives like socialism or communism are. They don't know that their prosperity is built on top of the exploitation and suffering of the third world. Capitalists certainly don't think of it like that, nor do many of the workers, and perhaps plenty of the third world doesn't think of it like that either. It's something vast amounts of the international population has simply accepted... and the bourgeoisie wants it that way. *Propaganda and otherwise intellectual sabotage runs deep.* Even among their own ranks.\n\nSurely some of them know this. I'm sure plenty of the people who sit atop Nestle's empire figure that what they're doing is considered exploitative and downright shitty. I couldn't tell you how people like that sleep at night. But otherwise for less glaring issues, capitalists see exploitation as a way of life... as nothing but another opportunity for growth. They don't view anything as exploitation. They view it as one dimensional as can be. That they earn their success. And they're providing more for their market, so of course they view themselves as good people. **Ignorance is bliss.**\n\nPeople like us can spend the livelong day trying to get the right knowledge out there, but capitalism was not built to our advantage.

{"author":"Anargnome-Communist","body":"That's not how it works. You can't help being privileged. You didn't choose any of this. You didn't opt in for being a (cis) straight white male, and you didn't deliberately choose to live in a world where being that offers some inherent advantages. \n\nYou're already doing the first thing right: acknowledging that you have privilege because of who you are. There's nothing wrong with being straight, white, or male as long as you realize this colors how others see you, how you see others, and how most of society treats you better because of that. \n\nThe next step is working to empower others. Seek out different perspectives. Respect people with different backgrounds. When you're in a mixed group, avoid being the dominant speaker or decision-maker, and politely and without judgment ask others for input. Realize that you can't have all the facts. You don't have firsthand experience with systemic racism, being misgendered, being belittled for who you love, etc. Accept that and trust that those who have those experiences are truthful about it and know more about those. \n\nAlso learn about how structures of oppression can hurt you. Toxic masculinity leads to shorter, less healthy lives, higher suicide rates, being more likely to be a victim of violent crimes... Homophobia hurts male friendships and ways to express those. Sexism makes it harder to have equal and respectful relationships with others. Xenophobia limits our understanding of the world. Transphobia makes experimenting with your identity harder. Classism hurts the working class, no matter their background. \n\nThe third step is weaponizing your privilege to bring about change. As a straight white male, you can do things that are harder or more dangerous for others. When you talk, people are likely to listen. If you shut someone down who's being homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, etc. it will have an impact, especially when you're talking to another straight white male. \n\nPrivilege is a tool you can use to change the world around you. Preferably in a direction where everyone has access to the advantages we as straight, white men have. (Well, I'm not straight, but I'm married to a woman, so I benefit from straight privilege a lot.) \n\nPrivilege *is* problematic, but it's mostly a tool to analyze society and power structures within it. It becomes really dangerous when (a) you don't realize you have it, (b) don't acknowledge that not everyone starts at the same level, (c) abuse your privilege to dominate others, and (d) feel entitled to your privilege and feel like it needs defending. \n\n*TL;DR: Don't get paralyzed by your privilege. This benefits the powerful and doesn't help the oppressed.

Do you think impoverished Africans are depressed about them not being good people or because their impoverished?

However, only through economics can you minimalize suffering. That's why at charities you donate money, not good wishes.

I try to be objective as possible so that I can the best answer, not just one that makes me feel good. \n\nNonetheless, you brought up questions I'd like to recognize. -What is the fundamental force that drives Marxists to seek a revolution?- Revolution is a tool, not a symbolic gesture. Because the bourgeoisie don't want to surrender power, communist believe we should seize it from them in order to create a more fair egalitarian society. -What would drive a revolutionary leader to self-sacrifice for their people if not empathy?- I'm starting to get the idea that your a romantic, besides that, you dont need empathy in order to fight for what you consider just. I dont know what you mean by, \"Self-sacrifice\" but if you want your ideas to come to fruition, you fight for them. If you dont fight for your ideas, then what worth are they? I'm a communist because I believe that capitalism is inherently flawed and should be replaced by a system that is more egalitarian, that rewards hard work rather then inheritance. The only way to achieve true equality is equal access to resources so you can decide what your fate, not some random coincidence deemed by rich elites. \n\nYou can believe in Communist because you believe it's a more moral system. Communist works because it's based on scientific evidence, the reason we view it as \"moral\" is because the economist that researched this idea, wanted to end human suffering. Even if it was only by a small margin. However, when you neglect the Socio-economics side, you doom the movement to being nothing more then an emotional outcry rather then a legitimate economic theory that could not only lower human suffering but also bring about a more happy and prosperous life for EVERYONE, regardless of race, ethnicity and gender.

This response might be kind of long winded, but I'll try to clarify what I can for you.\n\nAs another comrade said, we define a communist society as a classless and stateless socialist society, so by the time we would describe a society as communist it would no longer have a state. There are some other qualities of a communist society that we tend to talk about, but they aren't as universally agreed upon. Two of those are to be moneyless and global. The moneyless quality is understood not as simply burning all the money, but rather by having developed systems both of production and distribution to the point that they both exist exclusively to meet the needs and wants of society. At the point when everyone is fed, clothed, housed, educated, free from want, and certain that their neighbors are as well, exchange can move from an individual to a social level and thus remove both the need and use of money. On globalism, by this we tend to mean that states arise out of material and social necessity, and part of those necessities are that states provide defense against and representation to other states. Having one of two bordering states dissolve would lead to chaos for both.\n\nIf you are wondering how we would describe the eastern bloc or North Korea, we would call them socialist states. That being said, even now there is serious debate as to whether or not any of these countries are\/were socialist, so while I could give you my opinion there is no one authoritative answer.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but I imagine the question you were asking was more along the lines of \"What would a perfect socialist state look like?\" This is a bit harder to answer, but the short answer is that we see socialism as the transition phase into communism, so while we would praise the achievements of a socialist state there is no one fixed point that we see as wholly ideal.\n\nI hope that helps you a bit.

{"author":"Vladith","body":"The Romanian government had some very very significant social problems, definitely the most troublesome of socialist Europe. To counter the rapid population loss due to emigration, virtually all contraception and abortions were prohibited in the 1960s. This did help stabilize the population, but at the enormous social cost of destroying the reproductive freedom that Romanian women enjoyed in the earlier socialist period, and filling orphanages with tens of thousands of unwanted children. This is stark contrast to the situation in neighboring Bulgaria, where feminist organizations received major state patronage and women formed a huge proportion of the legislature.\n\nMuch (most?) of the emigration that spurred this policy was from Romania's centuries-old Jewish community, which had shrunk from 360,000 immediately after the Holocaust to 23,000 by 1987. While there was also substantial Jewish emigration from Poland and the Soviet Union, as Jews throughout Europe sought to escape the legacy of the Holocaust, emigration in Romania was particularly stark and I think it may have been connected to Romania's genuinely reactionary policy of \"National Communism\" that began in the 1960s. While this policy was in no way comparable to the horrific nationalism of Romanian fascists Ion Antonescu or the truly monstrous Condreanu, Romania's second generation of communist leadership disavowed the revolutionary and historical contributions of ethnic minorities (Roma, Jews, Hungarians, and Slavic-speakers) and basically disavowed the international socialist project.\n\nSimultaneous to this chauvinist nationalist turn, Romania's leadership enjoyed warm relations with both Israel and the United States. Communists should be incredibly guarded in their praise of Romania's socialist period, especially when there so many less harmful societies existed in the region.\n \n","created_utc":1538690797,"score":15,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"samyojana","body":"&gt;Suffering *almost* has everything to do with material wealth.... only through economics can you minimalize suffering.\n\nThis is where we differ, as I know by direct experience that this is not the case, as anyone who has spent time in solitude will tell you. There is a reason solitary confinement is used as a punishment, considered by some to be cruel and unusual. Try it for yourself: go to a 2 week meditation retreat or a similar low sensory environment where you will be well provided for materially and see if you do not experience worse suffering than you ever have before. I will come out here and state that I am speaking from an orthodox Buddhist perspective here. There is mental (emotional) suffering and physical suffering, and I don't see how we can handwave it away; mental illness is real, emotional pain is real, anxiety is real, emotional abuse is real, depression is real.\n\nI don't deny, of course, that a great deal of suffering can be alleviated by improvement of the material condition of the average person, which is why I am interested in Marxism. But as we know, there is a limit to the alleviation of suffering through material goods alone, as we see from the diminishing returns on subjective happiness as income increases past \\~$65k \/year (i.e. past the point where the requisites of life are well provided.) You can only eat so much porridge.\n\n&gt;I'm a communist because I believe that capitalism is inherently flawed and should be replaced by a system that is more egalitarian, that rewards hard work rather then inheritance....  the reason we view it as \"moral\" is because the economist that researched this idea, wanted to end human suffering.\n\nAgree. But in your first post, which I took issue with initially, you contradict this:\n\n&gt;If your a communist\/ socialist because you think it's more moral, then your a socialist for the wrong reason. Socialsim is a strong economic theory and doesn't need morality to win people over. Socialism will only ever win people over through economics...\n\nI am merely arguing that there is both a moral argument and an economic argument for socialism and there must be, because economic value judgements (about how things *should* or *ought* to be) can only be made in the context of some kind of value system, which economic theory alone does not provide. So if Marxism is purely materialistic, perhaps it doesn't take enough of the picture into account. I argue that Marx's thought must have been deeply rooted in compassion for his fellow human beings, he must have wanted us all to be happy and well, and I can't imagine how it could be otherwise. But I am new to all this and just become sympathetic to Left thought a few months ago when I realized it meshed so well with my own beliefs. The only problem with it I have is this materialist approach which seems to cut off a lot of potential for the movement.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;","created_utc":1538693506,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Such, for example, are the survivals of old divisions of labour, the lack of complete economic equality, survivals of the past in the minds and behaviour of people, and so forth.\n\nUnder communism, the higher phase of the new system, mechanisation and automation reach unprecedented proportions in production, and the level of labour productivity and output is so high that society can go over from the socialist principle of distribution - \u201cFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his work\u201d - to the qualitatively new, communist principle - \u201cFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.\u201d Labour itself changes considerably. All citizens will have an inner urge to work for the benefit of society voluntarily and according to their inclinations.\n\nMarked qualitative changes will take place not only in economy but also in social relations, in people\u2019s thinking and the way of life. The essential distinctions between town and county and then between mental and physical labour will disappear and all citizens will be workers of a communist society. The state will wither away and socialist statehood will develop into communist social self-government.\n\n\u201cCommunism,\u201d states the Programme of the C.P.S.U., \u201cis a classless social system with one form of public ownership of the means of production and full social equality of all members of society; under it, the all-round development of people will be accompanied by the growth of the productive forces through continuous progress in science and technology; all the springs of co-operative wealth will flow more abundantly, and the great principle \u2018From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\u2019 will be implemented. Communism is a highly organised society of free, socially conscious working people in which public self-government will be established, a society in which labour for the good of society will become the prime vital requirement of everyone, a necessity recognized by one and all, and the ability of each person will be employed to the greatest benefit of the people.\u201d\n\nTo carry out these fundamental qualitative transformations society needs time and the corresponding material, social and spiritual prerequisites: a large material and technical basis, improved social relations that will be free of exploitation of man by man, a rich culture, and a high level of political consciousness among the people. Insofar as all these prerequisites are created *only under socialism it is impossible to by-pass the socialist stage of development, to accomplish a leap directly from capitalism to the higher stage of communism*. \u201cFrom capitalism,\u201d Lenin wrote, \u201cmankind can pass directly only to socialism, i.e., to the social ownership of the means of production and the distribution of products according to the amount of work performed by each individual.\u201d^2\u201d\n\n1: Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 25, p. 471.\n\n2: Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 24, pp. 84-85.","created_utc":1538697761,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

The following article is useful, because it cites the words of some prominent StW members (Owen Jones, Andrew Murray) who actively supported the notion that Libya was a hub of spontaneous popular resistance, and actively denied the notion that imperialist meddling had anything to do with it:\n\n[http:\/\/blog.cpgb-ml.org\/stop-the-war-leaders-and-libya-you-can%E2%80%99t-expel-the-truth\/](http:\/\/blog.cpgb-ml.org\/stop-the-war-leaders-and-libya-you-can%E2%80%99t-expel-the-truth\/)\n\nEdit: removed a link to another article because the source was extremely dubious and I don't think it should deserves to be mentioned here. I have extracted the following link from it, though - a tweet from StW calling for a protest outside the Libyan embassy in 2011:\n\n[https:\/\/twitter.com\/STWuk\/status\/39311236055310336](https:\/\/twitter.com\/STWuk\/status\/39311236055310336)\n\nI cannot find any other sources about this protest, nor any photos from it. The content of the aforelinked CPGB-ML article is damning enough, IMO.","created_utc":1538737498,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"EnvironmentalQuail","body":"Chapter 7 \"...we must give a definition of imperialism that will include the following five of its basic features: 1) the concentration of production and capital has developed to such a high stage that it has created monopolies which play a decisive role in economic life; 2) the merging of bank capital with industrial capital, and the creation, on the basis of this \"finance capital,\" of a financial oligarchy; 3) the export of capital as distinguished from the export of commodities acquires exceptional importance; 4) the formation of international monopolist capitalist combines which share the world among themselves, and 5) territorial division of the whole world among the biggest capitalist powers is completed. Imperialism is capitalism in that stage of development in which the dominance of monopolies and finance capital has established itself; in which the export of capital has acquired pronounced importance; in which the division of the world among the international trusts has begun; in which the division of all territories of the globe among the biggest capitalist powers has been completed.\"","created_utc":1538737789,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

Reading up on theory and understanding the historical context it was written in can do wonders to really help you mold your own opinions and stances on critical issues that hold back the progression towards a communist future. That being said, real world interactions with and efforts to directly organize the working class will always be more important than studying up on theory when it comes to making communism a reality. However, we do often see the extreme of people who are very involved in their communities, but have no theoretical framework to give direction to what they do, so they at best accomplish nothing of lasting value, or at worst unknowingly help the capitalist system or reactionary forces in times of crisis. There has to be a fine balance between theory and real world practice\/involvement, and that requires doing at least *some* reading. \n\nThat being said, I don\u2019t think anyone expects every communist to read four hundred or even four dozen books in order to have a good grasp of how a communist society should be organized and what major steps we should take in order to achieve that material reality. That\u2019s just not realistic, and ultimately many theorists and writers are just rehashing the ideas of those who came before them, so going back to the major influential theorists usually will give you a solid enough base to start making sound decisions on what you should do in the here and now. I love leftist podcasts and YouTube channels as much as the next person, but ultimately the heavily summarized and simplified explanations of complex theoretical topics that those resources provide are interpretations made by knowledgeable people...which can still be biased and flawed interpretations that give you a skewed view of the intentions of the original authors and the circumstances they lived in. This is why one should always do themselves the service of reading the source material for themselves if they have the time and access to those reading materials.

Letting Americans in, but preventing families from uniting, seems bizarre.\n* Non-combatants from North Korea pose no threat by visiting family and preventing family reunification is bad.

{"author":"youngsteinbeck","body":"This is probably the most confusing post I have ever read.\n\nMaybe I'm misunderstanding you, but it actually was 'good' (necessary is a better word) for Nazi Germany to overextend itself across Europe while allowing the Soviet Union to regroup after the purges, expand industrialization (including a massive militarization with expansions of officers and equipment), fortify their borders and major cities, and move critical resources, populations, and infrastructure to central Russia. The European and American left didn't initially support the pact. They supported the Soviet policy of a British-French-Polish-Soviet encirclement of Nazi Germany, but whenever it was offered by Soviet telegrams, Britain and Poland aggressively refused to participate. After Poland showed where it stood ideologically and diplomatically, got invaded, and then dissolved its central government, the Red Army moved in to re-annex Galicia and West Belarus. The Soviet Union was not isolated by any formal condemnations or resolutions from the 'world community' (major European powers and the United States) because it was broadly recognized the Polish government was no longer legitimate after its president, ministries, parliament, and military officers fled across Polish borders. The subjugation of 'Western Poland' was a necessary compromise, and nothing important was lost by the Soviet and British governments effectively leaving it to the Nazi government.\n\nWe don't have to 'support' it, which effectively means nothing in a First World context, but we can be neutral. We can say 'we're neutral on American intervention, as well as on Russian, Turkish, Iranian, and Saudi intervention,' as in 'if the United States wants to set standards, any countries it doesn't like can appeal to those standards.' We can tacitly provide legitimacy to any anti-American forces without sacrificing formality, legality, and diplomacy. We can use U.S. legal cliches and standards against them. 'Neutrality' serves that end as it served Soviet ends in dis-recognizing Poland.","created_utc":1538889524,"score":11,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"predalienmack","body":"Shaun typically focuses on the far right and their tactics with  thorough analyses. He definitely creates a lot of well thought out and well evidenced arguments.  He does focus more on analyzing the right than explicitly talking about leftist topics themselves, but the little glimpses of what he likely believes that do come through in his commentary (such as his analysis of the clashes in Charlottesville) make me think he is further left than dem socs. He is probably the most informative of the bunch in terms of having hard facts on hand and having an academic approach to his video presentation style and voice delivery. I think Shaun does a great job of trying to directly appeal to and address some of the non fascist right wingers who watch his videos that might otherwise be swayed by the information presented by current fascist public figures and youtubers. He does a good job of really nailing how much the right has to distort facts and outright lie in order to sell their ideas to unwitting people who are new to more radical (i.e., not liberal) political perspectives. \n\nHbomberguy is the most entertaining of the bunch to me just because he is such a strange guy that doesn\u2019t hold back with presenting his quirks in his videos. There\u2019s something that feels very genuine about his delivery and how the ideas in his videos seem to be just things he finds interesting on a personal level that he decided to write about and analyze. He is very clearly anticapitalist and does a great job linking his analyses of random things like video games to the ways they highlight the flaws of capitalism without being too on the nose. I think he is also aware of the fact that many people who watch his videos seem to be right wingers who get sent to his videos by right wing youtubers, so I think he pumps the brakes a bit on the socialist angle in favor of being entertaining and more funny so that he can then sneak in leftist perspectives in order to sway some people who are teetering on the fence of radicalizing towards the right, which honestly isn\u2019t that terrible of an idea since hardline leftist YouTubers like Comrade Hakim can be difficult to swallow for people who are just being exposed to far left and right wing perspectives. He\u2019s definitely more entertainment-oriented than focused on heavily substantive analysis or arguments though, which is fine if you go into his videos expecting that.\n\nContrapoints is the toughest to evaluate from the bunch. She does a genuinely great job of presenting often difficult to understand topics in an entertaining and informative way, particularly as they pertain to trans and gender-oriented topics in general. I would not be shocked if she is the most well read of the three when it comes to leftist history and literature, but some of her takes are not exactly what I would call far left at all. She has the most creative format for her videos, as her emphasis on characters she has invented, which are all caricatures of either existing stereotypes or actually existing people, having conversations with one another is basically like a Socratic dialogue with herself. It is pretty fascinating to see her very apparent inner conflicts and struggles that relate to her being a trans woman being put out there, which really does a good job of giving cis people like myself a lens to see the trans and nonbinary community\u2019s very real struggles, on an individual and collective level, in an easier to understand light. The strength of her videos (the interplay between her characters) is also her greatest weakness, because sometimes she presents these arguments from both the far left and far right with such conviction that it is hard to tell if she really has a hard stance on many of these issues, which might be the point...but it\u2019s still hard to stomach a trans woman word for word repeating fascist rhetoric to herself for the sake of a simulated argument...definitely has the feeling of liberalism or anarchism at times. I think her content is especially worth checking out for cis people regardless. ","created_utc":1538921161,"score":9,"subreddit":"communism"}

If having to make a decision in a firm's boardroom which would potentially cause suffering would normally make you uneasy, by thinking as yourself as a grain of sand in the universe and as one with it, it suddenly becomes easier. For the worker too, this is positive in the short term because it helps you to get by, but overall it just maintains capitalism afloat. Remember what Marx said : 'Religion is the opium of the people'. He didn't meant that religions were directly harming the masses, I think he meant the contrary. Precisely because it was allowing the masses to get by and to endure capitalism, for that reason it was bad overall. This Buddhist attitude of 'being one with the universe', 'complete compassion with the other', 'elimination of the ego' is so compatible with the usual liberal crap (sorry for being rude here) that it cannot be good. By pacifying the workers emotions and ideals through relativism and Orientalism, I think meditation and especially Buddhist meditation just slow dialectical-materialism. It is not related to meditation or mindfulness, but a good example of outright reactionary Orientalism is the Caste system in India which is disastrous for the working class in the long term.

{"author":"theDashRendar","body":"I'm just going to list a couple of big reasons, with a specific regard to 20th century socialist countries. The points I will put forward are by no means exhaustive:\n\n1) Socialism has never been allowed to succeed (or fail) on its own merits, but only under the unending siege from imperialists, who will stop at nothing to see any and every socialist movement (with any real momentum behind it) in the world crushed: whether it be through direct invasions (as we saw in the Russian Civil War, when America, France, Britain, Germany and others all dropped what they were doing to invade the fledgling USSR, because a proletariat state even existing, is a very real challenge to their claims on power), assassinations, coups, blockades, embargoes, sabotage, extortion, contras, election-rigging, terrorism, kidnappings, and whatever other means are available to attempt to ruin, damage or destroy any effort to establish socialism anywhere on the planet. So socialists are forced to not only build socialism, but simultaneously fend off the most powerful empires in the world, endlessly, while trying to build socialism. This creates a rather nasty contradiction, where the only successful socialist states capable of holding territory for more than a few months are (forced to be) highly militarized. Socialism has never been left to be at peace.\n\n2) For hundreds of millions of people - socialism has worked - remarkably. Paraphrasing Parenti here, but for hundreds of millions of humans, really existing socialist states have taken people whose material conditions were inadequate (lacking food, lacking shelter, lacking clean water, lacking (real) freedom, lacking medicine, lacking political power, lacking any sort of life with dignity) and elevated them to a place in which their conditions were adequate (where they had those things). That's an enormous achievement - among the most significant in human history - and it is endlessly downplayed or ignored, especially in the west, because our conditions have been abundant for as long as we've known (which is largely a result of plundering the third world to the bone), so to wealthy westerners, adequate seems like quite a step down - but for billions of people on the planet, adequate would be an enormous improvement.\n\n3) Western media has endlessly filled its citizens heads with propaganda that communism is evil and has never worked and can only do bad (after all, the owners of said media have a rather significant investment in maintaining the status quo), and as such, will go to great lengths to suppress, downplay, or outright ignore the many achievements of communism. Cuba is among the world leaders in medical science. A tiny resource depleted island, under the largest and longest economic embargo in all of history, somehow achieves higher life expectancy and lower infant mortality than the United States. That's rather odd for such a failure of a system, no? The Soviet Union defeated Hitler and the Nazis - at extreme cost - and the west frequently downplays, misrepresents, or ignores the (decisive) Russian contribution to saving the world. Pol Pot's wicked regime (which the US still tried to recognize as legitimate for 10 years after it was toppled) met its end at the hand of the heroic Vietnamese communists, who had lost so much already defending their homeland from American invaders.\n\n4) Touching on the previous point - compare Russia in 1910 to any of the capitalist cores at the same time. If you were to do a \"Global Power Rankings,\" 1910 Russia would not even make the Top 5. Compare the 1910 Russian economy to 1910 Britain or 1910 America - it wasn't industrialized, very little rail, ~20% literacy, totally dependent on agriculture, with massive institutions from feudalism still in place. You could easily say they were 75-80 years behind Britain or America. Then compare that to 1960s Russia. Unambiguously 2nd in any global power ranking, fully literate, fully industrialized, rail connecting much of the country, putting humans in space and one of the world leaders in science, full education and healthcare for its citizens, eliminated homelessness, and some of the most impressive economic output in human history. Compared to 1960's Britain or England, they were now only 30-40 years behind. Even compare 1990 Russia (this is a delightfully awkward moment that neoliberals don't like to talk about, where for a small moment in history, Soviet GDP was actually larger than American GDP) - they were inventing cell phones and Tetris - they were only about 10-20 years behind America or Britain. They had almost completely caught up.\n\nThis is even where the whole etymology of first world, second world, third world comes from. Russia in the 1910s wasn't the first world, like England or Britain - they were not an advanced, developed economy. They were the third world. And then communism happened, and the conditions in Russia improved so much, so fast, that you could no longer call Russia the third world - they had to create a new status - the second world - for these countries who had closed the gap so significantly. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia fell behind again by at least a decade, and most of the country (outside the wealthier parts of Moscow or St. Petersburg) went right back to being the third world, where much of the country remains to this day.","created_utc":1538980815,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

Anarchists are more nuanced than you make it seem as is their political impact on imperialism. I see myself as a Marxist, but if it wasn't for my local anarchist friends we would have no local party structure, no anti-fascist action, and no living debate that helps us all understand theory and practical approaches better. I argue that the way you dismiss her as a supporter of imperialism is nothing but infighting that strengthens imperialism. This might be a roundabout way of looking at it, but no less roundabout than \"If you don't defend actually existing socialism you are in effect supporting imperialism.\" . Because while the anarchist scene is lacking in people who support actually existing socialism, our communist scene, at least where I live, is severely lacking in people who are willing to perform a scientific and practical analysis of why past socialist revolutions eventually failed, and being honest with our mistakes. Something that cannot be said about anarchists.\nYou know, I think neither tendency in itself is particularly helping the anti-imperialist cause, and I hope this doesn't come across as some centrist bullshit. \nAnd while anarchists make silly points most of the time (at least my friends often derive their material analysis from an ideology as starting point which I see as a huge mistake), you will find that sometimes they have some insights that are of practical use, or theoretically interesting.

If there is a coherent point here, the author's failure to explain it obscures it entirely.\n\nAuthor claims the 'potshots' taken taken at large corporations misunderstands what capitalism is - in his view, it is 'free markets'.

Author fails to advance an explanation of how a 'free market' would work or be effective without these.\n\nAuthor proceeds directly from this point to claim capitalism 'is the most effective system in the world'. No substantiation - just a bare assertion. We are beginning to see a theme emerge.\n\nAuthor claims critics of capitalism assume wealth is a static, not growing 'pie'. This is incorrect - at least, in a Marxist analysis. It's not that we assume the pie doesn't grow - it's that we consider it injust that the beneficiaries of smaller slices are typically exploited to increase the share of recipients of bigger slices.\n\nAuthor proceeds to try to explain why 'wealth' and 'money' are separate.

{"author":"lupunicu","body":"Now, since from what I've seen here national-communism isn't regarded as the most progressive ideology (which it isn't), let me give you some context for why it rose up in the SRR, and how it worked:\n\nBecause Romanian people have very little in common to their Slavic neighbors, historically speaking, people didn't regard the USSR as occupants for no reason, in fact the Red Army was very cautious of us themselves, since we even waged war against them initially. Like our contemporary African examples, the same popular attitude was born in the SRR as well, struggling for complete self-sovereignty, and as the African examples, nationalism was pushed through historical examples of conflicts initiated by neighboring countries. What was promoted wasn't superiority of our own nationality, but caution on what could make the country another serfdom. Marx talked about this in a thesis about Transylvania under Austro-Hungarian occupation (of which I can't recall the name). Romanian national-communism wanted voluntary cooperation that the leadership couldn't see from the USSR, so the CPR started improving relations with China, and unfortunately, the west. The nationalist part was pushed to remind the people of what their ancestors have been through time and time again, so they won't be.\n\nThe Socialist Republic of Romania was **the first country in the history of humanity** who payed it's external debt entirely, an achievement that I wouldn't necessarily claim is related to the ideology, but nonetheless is worth mentioning as well. It had a lot of external investment (much like the Popular Republic of China has now), and in 1988, wanted to create it's own international bank to compete with the US, something often considered one of the main reasons the CIA desperately tried to overthrow the regime. \n\nIf I missed something, someone wants sources, or to point out a mistake, feel free to do so, I'll gladly engage.","created_utc":1539050383,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"rockoman100","body":"Here is the article in a comment so that you don't have to give wsws your click:\n\nObama endorses DSA\u2019s Ocasio-Cortez, along with CIA Democrats\n\nBy Nick Barrickman\u00a0\n8 October 2018\n\nLast week, Barack Obama endorsed several hundred Democratic Party candidates running in key state and congressional midterm races around the country. \u201cToday, I\u2019m proud to endorse \u2026 Democratic candidates who aren\u2019t just running against something, but for something,\u201d declared the former US president.\n\nMost politically significant among Obama\u2019s endorsements was Democratic Socialists of America member Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is running for Congress in New York. In response to Obama\u2019s endorsement, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a courteous \u201cThank you, [Barack Obama]. Time to bring it home this November. Help us organize for healthcare, housing, education, and justice for all.\u201d\n\nThis effective reverse endorsement by Ocasio-Cortez for Obama, whom she has never criticized, is also a declaration of solidarity with the Obama administration\u2019s policies. The administration oversaw the bailout of Wall Street and a massive transfer of wealth to the corporate and financial elite; an attack on health care fraudulently packaged as a reform; the deportation of 3 million immigrants, more than any president before him; and eight years of unending war, including drone assassinations and the expansion of the intelligence apparatus\u2019 spying on the population.\n\nObama\u2019s support for Ocasio-Cortez makes it absolutely clear, if further confirmation was necessary, that the DSA is nothing more than a subsidiary of the Democratic Party. It is an instrument created to expand the Democrats\u2019 electoral base by convincing young people who would otherwise not vote for the Democrats that this right-wing, militarist party is moving to the left.\n\nAlongside Ocasio-Cortez, Obama endorsed several candidates with long histories in the US State Department, military and intelligence agencies. Among them is\u00a0Elissa Slotkin, a former Central Intelligence Agency official running in Michigan\u2019s 8th Congressional District; Max Rose, a former Army platoon leader running in New York\u2019s 11th Congressional District; and\u00a0Abigail Spanberger, another former CIA officer, running in Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District.\n\nThese figures and others, whom the\u00a0World Socialist Web Sitehas identified as the \u201cCIA Democrats,\u201d represent the largest bloc of candidates being fielded by the Democratic Party in the upcoming midterm elections. If the Democratic Party wins control of the House, this group will hold the balance of power in Congress.\n\nSince the election of Trump, the Democrats have sought to oppose Trump on the most right-wing basis possible. They have worked to demobilize mass hatred of the administration\u2019s anti-working class, militarist and anti-immigrant policies and direct opposition behind the anti-Russia campaign, including demands for greater military intervention in the Middle East. This has been combined with the promotion of the politics of racial and gender identity, pitched to privileged layers of the upper-middle class.\n\nThe politics of the DSA, Sanders and the like is not in conflict with this right-wing agenda, but rather in conformity with it. The job of figures such as Ocasio-Cortez and the rest will be to provide political cover for the pro-war, pro-austerity and anti-democratic policies of the CIA Democrats, while working to strengthen the grip of Wall Street and the military over political life.\n\nSince winning the nomination in New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District in June, Ocasio-Cortez has already\u00a0called\u00a0for votes for right-wing candidates, while tweeting her solemn\u00a0condolences\u00a0at the passing of Senator John McCain, a vicious warmonger and war criminal, in August.\n\nIn addition to Ocasio-Cortez, Obama endorsed \u201cprogressives\u201d such as\u00a0Ayanna Pressley, running for a congressional seat in Massachusetts, as well as the gubernatorial campaigns of Ben Jealous in Maryland and Andrew Gillum in Florida. Pressley has been endorsed by Ocasio-Cortez and other groups like the Justice Democrats and Democracy for America that orbit the Democratic Party, while both Jealous and Gillum have been endorsed by the Sanders wing of the Democratic Party and various trade unions.\n\nThe new list follows earlier endorsements of candidates for state and federal office in August, whom he described as \u201cdiverse, patriotic, and big-hearted.\u201d In September, Obama gave a speech at the University of Illinois campus at Urbana-Champaign in which he excoriated the sitting Republican President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans as \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cnot normal\u201d while urging Republicans to adopt a tougher foreign policy on Russia.\n\nThe logical conclusion to be drawn from his recent list of selections is that Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley and his other picks\u00a0do\u00a0possess the traits he finds lacking in Trump and the Republicans.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, Obama infamously referred to the conflict between the Democrats and Republicans as \u201can intramural scrimmage,\u201d with all sides on the \u201csame team.\u201d No matter how bitter their tactical conflicts, this assessment is in fact true. Both parties represent the corporate and financial elite.\n\nIn the case of the DSA, its relationship to the Democratic Party establishment does not even rise to the level of a \u201cscrimmage.\u201d They are merely the Democratic Party\u2019s second-string, called up to play an assigned position. Or, to use another metaphor, they are political actors, petty-bourgeois careerists who put on a left face, the better to deceive the audience and distract attention from what is actually going on.\n\nThose who may be attracted to the DSA under the mistaken impression that it represents a socialist alternative should draw the necessary conclusions.\n\n","created_utc":1539057309,"score":10,"subreddit":"communism"}

It is simply impossible to convince a great deal of people, especially in affluent countries such as my own, that the entire game of capitalism is rigged in favour of the few. \n\n  The other issue I've faced even when people do agree with the basic premise that capitalism is broken is that convincing them of a radical solution, of a completely new system, is often difficult.

{"author":"RichardsLeftNipple","body":"Sure, it can be to a degree thought of in that regard I suppose. Although it ignores the problem with investing that contradicts any socialist thing. \n\nYou need funds to participate. Compounding interest from long term investment is entirely related to time and initial amount with contributions. The only way for anyone who isn't already established is to take more risk so they can get a large enough return to invest into a reliable fund to maintain pace with someone who is already established in their wealth. \n\nYou know the math. Even on the most simple level starting at 6$ or 6000$ or 600,000$ the orders of magnitude stay the same with all else held constant. In other words the access to the same tools results in the same circumstances nothing has actually changed in the inequality. For example it takes about 120years at 6% annually for 6$ to become 6000$. But by that time if someone invested 6,000$ they'd have about 6,000,000$ at the same moment. No one actually becomes wealthier the zeros shift and the relationship stays the same. \n\nBut the final dollar sign is nearly irrelevant. Money is relative to the scarcity of goods and services. And the relative access to those goods and services. The minimum cost of living is a not proportional to your income. While the more excess income available enables someone to use a portion of that to invest. \n\nSo if the only way to maintain the current status quo is to invest and you have less disposable income because of the cost of living. Then you not only fall behind but you also have no way to catch up or keep pace unless you take more risk. \n\nBut then we reach the probability of success and finding parity. If you need to take a riskier investment in order to catch up, at this point the question is to what degree is the individual who is making these choices going to be participating in gambler's ruin. The higher the risk the less guaranteed the return. If the poorest decides to go with 6$ at 12.2% over 60 years they get close to 6000$. \n\nBut if that happens. Someone with 6000$ could do the same nothing stops them from doing the same thing. Or they could decide to get diverse have some security and some risk.\n\nMy point is that wealth generation through investment via the secondary market is not a vehicle for generating a future that increases equality for all. It is not a tool for upwards mobility. That in order for those with the least resources to even catch up they have to take on more risk and make quality of life sacrifices in areas of life where they are already doing the minimum. \n\nNo that's unreasonable and insane to ask those who live with less to live with even less so that they can have the same as what other do. The only reasonable way to create parity in a fair way is redistribution. It's especially clear from an investment only perspective. ","created_utc":1539111259,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

He was flawed, but would you have taken a gun with 80 other comrades to fight the Cuban government while having to sleep in a tent, depending on peasants food to survive and being regularly sick because you suffer from asthma ? Remember that he wasn't poor, he had a privileged position among the professional bourgeoisie as a doctor in Argentina. I couldn't have done it, but he did. Homosexuals in the UMAP (Unidades de ayuda a la production) ? Yes, but those 'concentration camps' contained not only homosexuals, but people that refused to engage in military training. Instead of defending the country like other men, they would contribute with their labor. It was not concentration camps because they were not exterminated, it was labor camps. The situation was complicated because the government feared an invasion which did happen by the way, so the labor camps was the solution the government found for people not willing to engage in the military.

Quant-driven investment strategies tend to come in a number of flavors, from simple factor-based investing (think Eugene Fama and Kenneth French and their EMH-oriented hypotheses), market-data driven (volume, price, other technical indicators), and broad non-traditional sources of data (using satellite imagery to evaluate oil production and proven reserves, or my favourite example [Muddy Waters Research](http:\/\/www.muddywatersresearch.com\/research\/tre\/initiating-coverage-treto\/) which collected a host of data points ranging from conference calls, site security camera footage, etc to expose a fraud that was later addressed by securities regulators). Admittedly, it's hedge fund bros that are the ones rushing to build and capitalise on technology driven investment management, but the capacity this technology has is pretty exciting when you consider the wider application to, say, economic planning.  \n\n\n&gt; Sorry for the hostility, but you seem to be replicating the neo-liberal scheme of measuring everything in money. If you want to build communism you have to base it on real world measurements, and use more than one variable to base your process for optimizing decisions on. \n\nWell, that's kind of the point with utilising big data in investment decision-making. Traditional investment analysis was solely focused on financial metrics but improvements in hardware have allowed firms to start considering wider sets of data (both traditional and non-traditional) when it comes to informing investment decisions as I have previously identified.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; I don't understand what that means. \n\nIt means that there's really no reason to be hostile.

{"author":"[deleted]","body":"I have seen this line of argument from conservative moralists seeking to blame the supposed moral decline of \"the West\" on the growth of welfare states and the abandonment of Christian \/ Protestant ethics toward work and deferred gratification. I recall a book by Gertrude Himmelfarb, a prominent cultural conservative, which decried the Bloomsbury group and implied that Keynes' (alleged) antipathy to saving money was based on his bisexuality - i.e. his statement that \"in the long run we are all dead\" is taken as a consequence of his childlessness, the real message being that gay people are reckless and selfish. \n\nThe superstructure of neoliberalism included a lot of religious right-wing sentiments, and homophobia was a big part of this, particularly during the Thatcher and Reagan era (e.g. the HIV\/AIDS crisis, Section 28). This kind of anti-Keynes slur would have hit all the right buttons in the ultra-reactionary context of the 1980s.\n\nNiall Ferguson reiterated this argument a few years ago. The fact that he was pressured to apologise might be indicative of the extent to which the superstructure of capitalism has managed to accommodate and placate gay liberals (in the UK, at least) - the neocons and National Review crowd pushing this rhetoric in the 1980s would never have to worry about the backlash faced by Ferguson. The influence of the religious right has declined in a lot of places (less so in the USA, I assume). The culture is still homophobic, obviously, and only tolerates the \"right\" kind of gay people, but the overt expression of anti-gay hostility has become harder to get away with.","created_utc":1539191156,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

People think the USSR was bad of that the way of life there was bad because they never actually watch read or listen to any source of information about the actual day to day life in the USSR.

The point is to understand why the Soviet Union became what it was , good and bad. Not just dismiss the Soviet Union because you think it was bad. \n\nThere are all kinds of very interesting analyses of even the Berlin Wall. I just read a very balanced book that defended the GDR. It talks about the good things. The bad things. And why things were the way they were. \n\nHere are some very interesting videos on the GDR: \n\nA socialist perspective on the GDR:\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/h1hvwPyEJ9k\n\n\nWhat you should know about the wall: \nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/QUr_HVsyIZQ\n\nAt the end of the day, speaking for myself, I used to be instinctively anti marxist Leninist too. I don\u2019t think of myself as having a tendency now, I just try to understand all different tendencies and what their point of view is. \n\nMy advice to people who disdainfully and reactively smear MLs as \u201ctankies\u201d is to take a close look at the material and historical circumstances that led to gulags, while appreciating also that the USSR was under constant attack, many spies, and that the historical record on even Stalin is not perfect. Finnish Bolshevik, whether you agree with him or not and independent of what you hear about his personal life, offers a robust, very thorough analysis with first and second hand direct sources. \n\nFrankly I think it\u2019s pretty limiting to not have a dialogue with all kinds of marxists. Again you don\u2019t have to love Stalin to also appreciate that the USSR among many other things offered lots of material aid to Korea, vietnam, Cuba, and many African countries. It was a highly successful planned economy. This is not in dispute nor should it be. A careful analysis of the actual record shows that the CIA was actually concerned that the Soviet economy could overtake the US. The only problem is that the USSR was overburdened by the Cold War and has to allocate too many resources to the military and industrial sector, since the USSR didn\u2019t undergo a capitalist revolution before the socialist one. \n\nThere are perspectives and replies to any question you can ask we should be examining these questions and answers dialectically instead of just posting blanket denoncistions. What do we learn if we just exclude?\n\nDo we like it when right wingers and centrists call people \u201cSJWs\u201d? And smear everyone with a buzzword and smear that doesn\u2019t allow them to express their views? Personally I\u2019m FOR a robust dialogue with any marxist of any tendency. If you\u2019re going to bash \u201ctankies\u201d address precisely what you\u2019re bashing in precisely what they are saying. Otherwise it\u2019s just lazy. You\u2019re making assumptions about what their arguments are without listening. Kind of like how right wingers don\u2019t know what marxism is but make all kind of dumb distorted arguments about marxism. It\u2019s frustrating right? So can you imagine how marxist leninists feel having their actual positions distorted ? A true intellectual considers unpopular opinions and tendencies and thinks about them critically. \u201c\n\nWhat did I get as a response? Links to Wikipedia articles. See for yourself one of their most recent posts. They are pretty dumb \n\n\n","created_utc":1539203090,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

I'm not suggesting some kind of class-reductionism, I just can't see how this is somehow of greater weight or importance than class contradiction. It certainly has been in other instances, such as the some of the ones you suggested, but I would hardly argue that Russian colonization of Siberia was the prime contradiction of the Russian empire.\n\nIf you mean to suggest that it is itself the class contradiction, then you've lost me, nothing else I say in this comment matters, and I want you to explain it to me so I can understand.\n\n&gt;reparations, and political autonomy.\n\nAbsolutely necessary.

If there are conflicting native and colonial claims, we can't side with the colonial people but at the same time can't always side with the native Americans unless the goal is total decolonization and repatriation. What if two or more native claims overlap? Additionally, do we mean political control, ownership, or both? How do we square that with the rights of the extant American proletariat? Is the land to be held in common by all the people, or just the native Americans? Who among the American population is to be considered native American? How do we establish a standard of native-American-ness? Have I misunderstood this all, and you mean to suggest that all Americans are colonized by the American government?\n\nI really do understand the importance of decolonization, but I don't understand how you see it as the prime contradiction.

The Alt-Right movement in Argentina is very small, on it's infancy. While they are not exactly the same, some individuals are pushing for a Argentinian-like Alt-Right movement, as you can't just copy-paste American Alt-Right into Argentinian politics because the talking points are very much not the same.\n\nYet, there is a Alt-Right-like movement on the rise. For example, there's this guy Agust\u00edn Laje.., studied in the US and returned to act as a \"new proposal\" for the Right-Wingers. He attacks Feminism, Immigration, Gender, Abortion, Left-Wingers (Anything that is to his left, is immediately labeled as Communist) and so on, from his narrative he is shares a common view with the Alt-Right, he even went as far as being *very* soft on the Last Military Dictatorship from the 70s, he basically claims it was a War and that a Dictatorship was needed to control Left-Wing Guerrillas (by torturing and disappearing 30.000 people), the same people that gave us Neoliberalism (Argentina's decline starts in the 70s, self-destruction) and the Falklands\/Malvinas War, he has stomach to do that.\n\nHe recently endorsed and celebrated Bolsonaro's Victory in Brazil, claiming that he is happy to see \"the right\" rising again in Latin America. So if he endorses Bolsonaro, then he is basically a racist and a misogynist. \n\nHe is a very able guy, somewhat similar to Ben Shapiro. He is young, he masters the use of social media and he spends his time humiliating people who don't have good debating skills. He's a dangerous guy because like the alt-right, he applies to the young people disappointed with life, telling them about the big conspiracy that the Left and the Feminists are preparing. There's also a small yet noticeable number of Alt-Right \"journalists\" hiding behind big media companies like La Nacion (Conservative) and Clarin (Neoliberal), with articles popping out from time to time, but then again, it's rare.\n\nThere's a much larger traditional Right-Wing, with people like Etchecopar (a well known racist and misogynist) and Eduardo Feinmann, a journalist very much against abortion but who once forced a woman to abort because he screwed up. The traditional right is all over the place and takes many forms, from Neoliberals to Catholics and Peronists, an Argentinian version of Italian Fascism dating from the mid 40s.\n\nSo yeah, while the small, but soon to be bigger alt-right is not similar to the one in the US and Europe, it still shares some similar points. Sure they are not running around crying about \"heritage\" or how the \"White Race is being persecuted\", but they are anti-semitic (at least on a very private level) as much as they are, let's remember that Argentina has one of the largest Jewish populations out there.\n\n\nSo yeah, that's what it is. There's a bit more but I'm afraid it'll take some time to write down. \n\n","created_utc":1539209454,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Benar451","body":"I'm a Hungarian born too late to experience any of the Hungarian Socialism, so most of my info comes from the many elderly people I've spoken to so far. Almost all of them agree in that:\n\n* After 1989 massive privatizations took place in Hungary, impacting most of the factories, mines and the agriculture. The once \"legendary\" Hungarian agriculture, which made Hungary completely self reliant on food,and had the ability to export lots of said food,is now no more. Lot of factories and mines were just closed when they traded owners, making thousands of people jobless(with laughable leave, of course)\nThe workers now earn less for more work, and pay more for products with worse quality than in socialism (for example, most elderly ppl lament the current quality of bread)\nIn return, we have more luxuries which we can't buy except if we work multiple jobs, and work every day of the week(or happen to be bourgeoisie)\nFurthermore, Hungary became a victim of imperialism this way and a lot of workers produce stuff for foreign companies (Bosch is a good example, the German bourgeoisie loves the comparably cheap Hungarian workforce)\n\n* We adopted a lot of stuff from the USSR culturally, for example, Pioneers, Socialist Realism and the leit of Soviet socialist songs(of course reinterpreted in Hungarian). Students in schools had compulsory Russian classes(which wasn't really changed, now we have compulsory English or German classes).\nHowever, everything we adopted from the Soviets \"felt\" Hungarian, which is funny because I bet in the 1st world people think that Soviet \"satellite\" states were just plastic copies of the USSR. That's pretty far from the truth.\nToday in the cities the most Hungarian things you are gonna see are all the old, about-to-collapse buildings. Most music produced today just sounds like American pop-music, with the same themes of \"have a lot of money, do a lot of drugs and party a lot till you die\".\nNo idea about the countryside tho. It almost feels like things haven't changed there since the last 100 years except electricity.\n\n* Anti-communist propaganda hits Nazi Germany levels, with the Hammer and Sickle and the Red Star symbol being outright banned. You learn the most vile propaganda about socialism in schools from history books that cite no sources.\nNaturally, that leads young people to believe that communism = bad....\nOn the other hand, year by year work conditions get worse and poverty increases, which leads most workers to hate the government and its ruling party-but not necessarily the economic system. That's where the main contradiction is in Hungarian society, other capitalist parties managed to successfully brainwash people to believe that the problem lies only in FIDESZ and not in capitalism itself.\n* They had less luxuries than capitalist countries\n\n* Western propaganda leading people to believe that if they adopt capitalism, they'll live the American dream\n\n* That is THE question, isn't it? What should we all do better? Should we just try to spread class consciousness as much as we can until the crises of capitalism eventually tips the balance in our favor? Should we try to organize Protracted People's War with the class conscious people we have at hand in the foreseeable future?\nI honestly don't know.\n\nSorry for the long read comrades, I guess TL;DR: Everything sucks now even tho it didn't before\n\nEdit: Made it 1% more readable","created_utc":1539262542,"score":29,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"WaterAirSoil","body":"Some really good replies. Here is a different type of marxian theory. \n\nOne of Marx\u2019s ideas is that in almost all societies there are people who can\u2019t work to produce anything, such as seniors, babies, the infirm, etc.  and in some societies there are people who then  work to produce more (surplus), to \u201cfeed the family\u201d so to say. Marx defined surplus as anything produced beyond the necessary needs that one person has to continue living. The profit of an enterprise can be considered the surplus workers labored to produce by creating more than they are getting paid for. \n\nProfs Richard Wolff and Stephen Resnick use this as a framework for their class theory. They see capitalism as being divided up into two classes, the people who produce the surplus (workers) and the people who appropriate the surplus (capitalist). Capitalists are the ones who get to keep the goods produced by the workers each day. They are then free to sell the goods, using the profits how they see fit, dividing it up into payroll (wages), rent, attorney fees, more raw materials, their own salaries, dividend payouts, etc., all of the things that go into running a company. So the workers sacrifice their time and health to produce goods and services for a capitalist who gets to sell said goods and services for their own profit. What does the worker get? Wages. Do wages come close to comparing with the executive salaries and dividend payouts? Not even close. So this discrepancy where one group of people produce the surplus in society and receive subpar living wages, while the other group owns the labor output and gets to live fat on the hog, is the cause of wealth inequality. \n\nSo, if capitalism is a production system where one group produces the surplus and another appropriates it. \n\nThen, communism can be thought of as a system where the same group that produces the surplus also appropriates it, think worker cooperatives. The more formal academic term is worker self directed enterprise WSDE. \n\n","created_utc":1539340269,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Yung_Scientist","body":"Before, the synthesizing of Marxism-Leninism, scientific socialists had a very mechanical view of the development of society. This vulgar materialism stemmed from the fact that they mostly discussed the development of the modes of production from the an angle that emphasized the productive forces and not the relations of production. They held that the superstructure (ideology, culture, religion) of society was merely a reflection of things changing the material base of society (the mode of production.) They believed that people's ideology could only advance with the development of technology. Ergo, the most economically advanced countries would posses the most ideologically advanced workers. This was a mechanical view that pictured society as a machine that merely needs to have certain levers pulled in order to work in a different manner. In a way, many of these early Marxist thinkers may have imagined that workers would grasp revolutionary theory and wage revolution in a spontaneous manner.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe development of Marxism-Leninism comes from the social practice of party building, of organization. This recognizes that the relations of production can develop beyond a mechanical view of a correspondence of the superstructure to the base of society. Organization and social practice represent the way in which the people can actively and consciously change the world. As Mao put it, when the people grasp revolutionary theory, it becomes a material force in history. This affirms dialectical materialism and exposes mechanical materialism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf organization and good conditions can bring about a revolution, then where will the bourgeoisie be the easiest to defeat? Where they are already weak. The 20th century proved that.","created_utc":1539356319,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

At that point it was assumed that it would take thousands of years, and generally thought to be beneficial as it would make winters less harsh, they basically thought it was like a glass greenhouse that allowed you to grow food out of season. \n\nIn the fifties oil companies figured out via privately funded research what was then called global warming, at this point the understanding was more sophisticated and understood as a threat. The motivation for the oil companies to fund this, was they had to understand what was going on, so they could react to what they call political risk. \n\nthe 1970s marks the point where the scientific community has reached consensus about climate change, and recognizes it as science fact, and there also was a big ceremonial function where they proclaimed this.\n\nFossil fuel companies have also funded green movements to fight against nuclear power because they see it as competition, and currently are funding green energy technologies that lack base-load capacity to sell back-up\/base-load natural-gas-power.\n\nQuite a lot of the people in the movements centred around climate change, are Eco-conservationists who wish to preserve nature exactly the way it is now, they usually oppose any modification of the environment regardless whether it is detrimental or beneficial, and they have a mystified understanding of what they call natural balances.

As if a) it's the only corrupt party, b) the only responsible for the recession, and c) after 4 terms, they will finally do a communist putsch. \n\nSince dissolving this hatred and stupid beliefs is hard (impossible, in my experience), I guess the best way forward would be to detach Haddad from the image of \"old\" PT, so people can compare Haddad and Bolsonaro more objectively - things today are way too emotional, people are not being logical at all, it's scary.","created_utc":1539463540,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

Turkish officials have said they believe the journalist, who was living in the US, was killed in the consulate. \n\nThe Saudi stock market plunged as much as 7 per cent on Sunday. \n\nSaudi Arabia has repeatedly denied any involvement in Mr Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance. But the case of the journalist, who wrote a regular column for the Washington Post and was critical of Saudi authorities, threatens to trigger the biggest diplomatic dispute between Riyadh and its western allies in years.\n\nIn an interview with CBS News\u2019 60 Minutes on Saturday, Mr Trump said the US was investigating the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, which he called \u201creally terrible and disgusting\u201d. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get to the bottom of it, and there will be severe punishment,\u201d Mr Trump said.\n\nSaudi Arabia is the US\u2019s top ally in the Arab world and has forged strong relations with a Trump administration that has embraced the region\u2019s strongmen leaders and taken an increasingly belligerent stance against Iran. \n\nAnalysts have said Mr Trump\u2019s apparent willingness to overlook human rights issues and the increasingly autocratic nature of the Gulf monarchies has emboldened leaders throughout the region to crackdown on dissent. The US president said last week that he would not be in favour of the US halting a vaunted $110bn in arms sales to Saudi Arabia because of Mr Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance. \n\nBut there has been growing outrage among US politicians over the allegations that a team of Saudis flew into Istanbul and tortured and killed the journalist. \n\nSeparately, Mr Trump has for weeks been seeking to pressure Riyadh \u2014 the only oil producer with significant spare capacity to increase crude exports \u2014 to help curb the rise in fuel prices as US midterm elections loom and cushion the impact of a fall in Iranian crude exports caused by US sanctions.\n\nHinting at his frustration with Riyadh, the US president this month told a campaign rally that King Salman may not last \u201ctwo weeks\u201d without US support. \n\n\u201cI love the king, King Salman, but I said, \u2018King, we\u2019re protecting you. You might not be there for two weeks without us. You have to pay for your military, you have to pay,\u2019\" Mr Trump said. \n\nSaudi Arabia and other Gulf monarchies warmly welcomed the election of Mr Trump as they had become increasingly exasperated by the former president Barack Obama, whom they accused of being soft on Iran. \n\nMr Trump\u2019s first foreign trip as president was to Saudi Arabia in May 2017, where he was regaled with pomp and ceremony. He used the trip to launch a tirade against Tehran, avoided any talk of human rights issues and promised a new era of relations with Arab leaders. \n\nPrince Mohammed has also developed close ties with Jared Kushner, Mr Trump\u2019s son-in-law and Middle East adviser.\n\nSince Mr Trump took office, Riyadh has promised billions of dollars of investment in the US, from arms deals to infrastructure spending.\n\nBut there have been growing signs of strains in relationship. The US administration has been frustrated by Saudi Arabia\u2019s and its allies\u2019 stubborn refusal to seek a political solution to the regional embargo they imposed on Qatar, another important US ally, more than a year ago. \n\nThere has also been rising concern among US congressmen over a Saudi-led coalition\u2019s role in the civil war in Yemen. A UN experts panel in August said the coalition, which has been accused of killing thousands of civilians, may be responsible for war crimes. \n\nUnder Prince Mohammed\u2019s stewardship, Saudi Arabia has pursued an increasingly assertive foreign policy and displayed an aggressive response to criticism at home and abroad\n\nAfter Canada called for the release of a human rights activists, Riyadh instructed fund managers to sell Canadian assets, cancelled a student exchange programme with the country and told Saudi medical patients to leave the North American country.

I believe this is, more or less, the case for every country with nukes.\n\nI'm honestly disappointed that you just assumed I'm like some Russia-phobe who lives in a comic book reality. I don't expect everyone to agree with me. I know, I am an exceptional cynic. My faith in human (human, not Russian) shittiness knows no bounds. No one likes to lose, and for some people. this is all a game, and some of those people are petty enough to do whatever is necessary to prevent something else from \"winning\" after they have lost.

{"author":"youngsteinbeck","body":"This is the internet, where no politics actually happen. I will indict and convict you as I please.\n\nAgain, 'a despot.' This is not a Marxist point of view. Marx literally renewed the classical definition of democracy when he began championing the 'dictatorship of the proletariat.' Rule of the mob. According to a Marxist, every leader represents a mob of a type or another, and always acts in the broad interests of that mob. Putin is not his own man and couldn't be in any scenario short of an apocalypse.\n\nAcknowledging the 'capability of the Ruskie' is not helping you, General Turgidson.\n\nI was closer to saying you thought of him as the opposite of super-human. I was saying you made a banal point about the 'Strangelove scenario' and subtly racialized it by way of omission. Again, you particularized the 'burn it all' thing to Putin, a Russian who represents the sentiments, beliefs and interests of tens of millions of Russians. You can revoke your obvious framing by saying, \"well, I was talking about game theory and the Berlin Wall,' but you didn't talk about game theory and the Berlin Wall. It isn't my fault you have to be half-confronted to explain your actual opinion.\n\nAgain, psycho-analyzing Putin, or any political personality, isn't what a Marxist does. It's also a social symptom of First World people who think Second and Third World leaders and their populations can fully and truly be understood by looking at their vague unconscious anxieties and not their actual political actions.\n\nAgain, pretending you were really talking about game theory doesn't convince me.\n\nAgain, I said your Strangelove point was banal.\n\nI assume based on what I know, and what I know is what you wrote, and what you wrote was obviously holding a double standard, particularized about a certain Russian.\n\nI like to the avoid the whole 'Russophobia' or 'Slavophobia' thing. In my personal experience, it's more insecurity or ignorance rather than fear or hatred. I was half-joking by referencing Dr. Strangelove. I understand you're a complex human being who can flesh out a mature and comprehensive worldview if you're pushed enough. I would say that if you were pushed far enough, it's more likely you would end up a reactionary.\n\nIf you're a cynic, you shouldn't be a Marxist, and again, in my personal experience (and if you think about the history of many of the greatest philosophers and historians), misanthropes and cynics are usually ethnic and racial in their thinking about the world. I like to think that isn't a coincidence.\n\nIf you have no faith, no quasi-irrational commitment to utopia, you'll lack vision and eventually fall back into thinking this is the best we can have and will find a tribe or mob to rally against others to keep things like they are. Again, a reactionary.\n\nAgain, I don't know or care about game theory, General.","created_utc":1539541058,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

You may be more cynical than you give yourself credit for.\n\nI would just like to say, I'm kind of at a loss for how, you can start with  comment about \"its a real possibility, the losers may try to bring the whole world down\" and then be all like, \"woah woah, take it easy, bud\" when someone comes like, \"yea, I think its more like a certainty.\"  And then dismiss my initial low effort comment with like, \"the world is not a Bond movie, nerd!\" I wasn't trying to come with a thesis, I thought we were already on the page. Like, yea, I think most people are shitty. Big whoop. But, you are like steering this ship in circles, talking about a hypothetical situation about a popular uprising against Putin, to citing Marx like \"Putin inherently represents the mob.\" I don't even understand how you arrived here, given where this started. \n\nAnd I'm sorry, but I really have a problem with you telling people, \"don't get on board with our vision if your experience has jaded you!\" I reject that idea, wholesale, because I am a cynic and a Marxist.

{"author":"youngsteinbeck","body":"It seemed like game theory, so I harped on it as a joke.\n\nAny angry sarcasm I might have is not rooted in cynicism (whatever that means at this point). It is rooted in seeing lazy confidence and subtle reaction masking itself as a fair and reasonable point of view. I like to be specific in my response to any point of view I respond to, whether it's specific or generic. It's a tic.\n\nWhen was I talking about a popular uprising? I said your point about 'losers responding' was banal. Maybe we're genuinely misunderstanding each other on that point.\n\nThe 'mob' point, as the entire point of my post, was a meta-point about you being a non-Marxist (Putin being a genuine representative of Russia or not was irrelevant) and very subtly, a reactionary.\n\nIt started with me basically calling you a liberal, which was built on an earlier comment where you used banal mainstream arguments to distinguish Russia from 'real Marxists.' I saw a common thread in what you were posting. I'm only responding to you because I don't want you influencing anyone here to think like you.\n\nI misspoke. I should have said you can't be a Marxist. Your cynicism will eventually lead you back to reaction. You can be a cynic. You can dislike what others do when you think they should have done better or different than what they did. You can let that consume you even, but you can't claim Marx was 'jaded' by say, the defeat of the Paris Commune. Quite the opposite. It refined what he saw as what means could lead to victory for the working class the world over, and it did in many places, and will continue to serve as the means, for many generations, to greater ends.\n\nI obviously can't be angry at you for not knowing, but my family was thoroughly harmed by the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia. I have 'experience.' I grew up with enough war stories to scare poor American kids with them. Almost none of my family, including myself, use it as an excuse to be a 'cynic' about others, to misread people's actions by looking at their unconscious anxieties or whatever you think is the best way to understand others. Neither of us can reconcile the practical macro-understanding of collective class interests with the quasi-Freudian or quasi-Jungian tropes anyone like you might call cynicism. We can't because it isn't possible.\n\nEveryone is a Utopian in the sense they have a standard. If they don't have the highest standard, they eventually fall back to the best standard, which is now. Hence, it turns you into a reactionary. It never matters if you reach the standard or not. Having the standard is what matters. And don't think this makes me not a hard-line pragmatist. I have many former Soviets in my family. I can argue about grain production for hours.\n\nIt's not about not allowing you to contribute. I'm telling you to change or you'll leave eventually. I just prefer you not to take anyone with you. It's not about perfect alignment. It's about not complaining when you live in the best part of the world and have the greatest responsibility to change it. It's about being rightly angry with anyone of your comrades (unless mental illness is involved) who choose to eventually avoid any actual change by boiling everything down to 'people are shitty.' The workers and peasants in Zimbabwe and Venezuela are struggling, but they aren't complaining, so why should I and why should you?\n\nI don't dislike you. I think your obvious hopelessness is dangerous.","created_utc":1539547818,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Communists are then forced to either keep using alienating but accurate language and symbols, or to appear as though they're trying to rebrand an irrelevant thought. Communists going forward need to state their aims in down to earth terms and then define themselves as a socialist, working class movement, otherwise they will only alienate themselves further from the disenfranchised workers, a working class that in America has become the voting base of reactionaries while the left is seen as a student's movement and current examples of our successes are attributed to other concerns and movements.

In a number of important industries, capitalist farms have already became dominant. For example, the top 0.2 percent (900 thousand) pig farms (more than 100 slaughtered per year) slaughtered more pigs than the bottom 95 percent (46 million small households) combined.\n\nWhat does this have to do with capitalism or socialism or collectivism? All it says is that there are more big farms (which are all state-owned, agriculture is one of the economic sectors that was designated for SOEs during the Reform and Opening, along with healthcare, education, banking, insurance, transportation, energy, heavy industry, etc) than small farms.

The Red Army didn't attack Polish troops, and the supreme commander of Polish military ordered his troops not to fight the Soviets, so the USSR was not a belligerent. \n\nThe Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact (which is **not** a formal military alliance as parroted by anti-communist soothsayers) created a line of Soviet interest beyond which the Germans couldn't invade. The Polish government could retreat beyond this line and from there offer peace terms or surrender to Germany. The Soviets wanted a buffer state between it and Nazi Germany, for obvious reasons. \n\nThis was in Poland's interest too, because there would still be an independent Polish state, and could continue exercising state sovereignty. The Soviets assured Polish security in case of Nazi German aggression. \n\nUnfortunately, when the Soviets crossed into Poland by 17 September 1939, there was **no longer a Polish government.** It collapsed; the Polish government fled into Romania and couldn't even continue governing in exile. **This means the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact no longer applied,** since there was no longer a functioning Polish state to negotiate peace or surrender with. \n\nSo the Soviets had to stop the Germans from advancing beyond that buffer zone itself. If the USSR didn't stop the German advance, there would've been a Nazi puppet state right on the Soviet border (although this same Polish government was also a Nazi collaborator, stealing land from Czechoslovakia in 1938). \n\n[This article](https:\/\/msuweb.montclair.edu\/~furrg\/research\/mlg09\/did_ussr_invade_poland.html#The%20USSR%20did%20not%20invade%20Poland) points out how we *know* Poland wasn't invaded by the USSR.

{"author":"r3volutionr0ck","body":"Speaking from Curitiba (Were Bolso received 65% of votes) I was talking to a friend recently and shit is bad. Like Trump, first was a joke, now is a tragedy. Haddad seems a very progressist guy, while education minister he was really, i mean REALLY, good. But his party is looking to the past every day. Here in my State Paran\u00e1, PT ( Partido Dos Trabalhadores translation: Worker's Party and also Haddad's Party), most voted deputy was Gleisi Hoffman, a woman who runned for the congress under the name \"Gleisi Lula\". Lula is a reference for the former brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio \"Lula\" Da Silva or just Lula. PT also tried to isolate the other left wing candidate, Ciro Gomes of PDT (Democratic Worker Party) in this election, so him isn't supporting PT, at this moment at least. The last one, Ciro, was the only candidate who \"could\", in the pools, win against Bolsonaro. \n\nWhat Happens here in Brazil is a Coup, who have been orchestrated since 2005. The year Mensal\u00e3o happened. Z\u00e9 Dirceu, one of the most popular politicians in Brazil and also from PT, was accused to pay members from the Center-Left\/Center-Right parties of the \ncoalition for the to APPROVE GOVERMENT PLANS(ipsis litteris). The most important of those parties was PMDB (Brazilian Democratic Moviment Party), now only MDB, the same name they used under the military autocracies. PMDB in 2005 was the second or third biggest party in brazil, only behind PT. With this scandal, in the other year, 2006, they surpassed PT with most deputies, while still on the coalition. \n\nThat Was when PMDB \"rose\" to power, they always were on power. From the five democratic elected presidents, 3 of them lost the goverment for the PMDB vice-president (Tancredo died, Collor and Dilma by impeachment). But in 2006 was different, what happened was that, if PMDB went to the opposition in 2010 elections they would probably win. So, in 2010, PT selected Michel Temer from PMDB for vice president and Dilma for president, Lula could not run again, since he was elected two times already. And this? The Prelude to all that's happening now. \n\nSince 2005 EVERY bad thing that happens everyone faults PT. But, until 2013 brazilian economy were stable, so everyone was okay with the \"communists\", except that PT rule is much more keynesian capitalism than communism. But when Dilma was relected in 2014, the congress voted to extend the shortfall of public expanses,  so they could have a reason to the impeachment, since she \"clearly was not able to rule\".\n\nIn the words of Guy Debord, what's happening? A Spectacle, rich people are angry, poor people alienated and sad that the socialist reform wasn't profund enough. There's no reference on TV that countries all over the world are against Bolsonaro.

Sure, rich people exists, and many of those rich people do shitty things, keep to themselves, and abuse their positions, but the concept of a class separation and the conflicts it causes didn't exist for you. The American economic system is a spectrum of money and work, and even if you were a good democrat who knows that the idea of hard working and bootstrapping your way to being a millionaire is ridiculous, there still wasn't the concept of a split society based on ownership of the means of production. There was still this idea of an America, even if it was heavily flawed and the people at the top seemed to work for their own self-interest, they weren't actively working against you *as a class* to maintain power through structural control. So many \"left\" leaning liberals believe in \"good billionaires\" and \"good politicians\" (or at least, less evil politicians), are thankful for police despite being critical of it's racism\/militarization, and cant imagine a world outside of the American constitution, and this is a result of not being able to see class separation.  \n\n\nSo you've got a whole society of people who are experiencing problems caused by something they literally don't have a word and concept for, and conspiracy theories attach themselves to that anxiety.

In one case, a 70 years old patient who had stage 3 colon cancer, died because of neglect in state hospital; his intestines were punctured twice during a biopsy that went wrong. We told his wife and daughter that they could report the crime, and since it was \"unintentional murder\", public prosecutor would take the case and possible compensation shall be awarded in an administrative court. They did not even report the incident because \"he was destined to die\". In many rape cases, the victim retracts her testimony (which in many cases effectively stops the investigation since the victim is the only witness) because she is scared.\n\nIn another case, in a construction of a hydroelectric dam, floodgates were placed wrong and it was leaking.

And yet, most of the families did not press charges, because they were financially compensated. Although it wouldn't matter since the court investigated and charged the people who were responsible *proprio motu*, both firms which constructed the dam saved their PR.\n\nNevertheless, sometimes people don't press charges because they don't want to be bothered, they are worried, they find no point to pursue the judicial procedures etc. Although, I indeed agree to be suspicious about the incidents that are presented in the media, but it is not correct to jump to conclusions if the victim \"just did not press charges\".\"","created_utc":1539733352,"score":10,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Squibums","body":"Fascism argues for \"class collaboration\", opposed to Marxist socialism which argues for \"class warfare\".  Class collaboration is about how the classes in a capitalist society must work together. Marxists know this is BS because the 2 classes, the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, are always at odds with one another. We have different class interests.\n\nFascists are racist, homophobic, and against all forms of what they consider \"degeneracy\". I can't speak for everyone, but most socialists\/communists aren't like that. We know the problems we face in society stem from the system we use (capitalism) and not specific groups of people.\n\nMarx wasn't utopian. He was against that sort of thinking. Marxist socialism is scientific socialism. He wanted a realistic way of achieving a better society and wasn't satisfied with sitting around trying to imagine the most perfect society.\n\nStalin and Hitler weren't friends. The closest they ever came to that was the Molotov-Ribbon Pact, which Stalin signed in order to postpone the inevitable war with Nazi Germany. I won't deny that socialist states have killed people, but the numbers you've come across are exaggerated. People will claim the Holodomor was on purpose, without considering the fact that Stalin's industrialization put an end to famines in the region entirely. Also, take a look around.

{"author":"ProlesOfMischief","body":"&gt; When is it moving towards a socialist mode of production?\n\nWell, officially it is attempting to achieve a Xiaokang society by 2021 which translates to something like \"moderately prosperous\", and to achieve modern socialist status by 2049 (100 centenary of the PRC).  \n  \nThe difficulty with these sorts of discussions is that one must take into account the history and geography of China as well as the overall status of the communist movement worldwide. What I mean by that is China needs resources, it's biggest goal for the past few decades has been to industrialize itself - it is the largest net importer of petroleum. In a socialist world resources would be produced and allocated based on rational planning. Unfortunately we don't live in a socialist world and unlike the west China cannot\/doesn't want to quasi-colonially *force* other nations to adopt certain economic systems which would benefit them, so it *must* enter into the world market. Which means it must deal with commodity exchange.   \n  \n(Here we can see, I believe, a similar sort of problem - having to necessarily tolerate commodity exchange - the USSR faced and which was described by Stalin in *Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR* when he spoke of the then present tolerance for collective property as a compromise in such a society where capitalism had not yet centralized agriculture enough to become outright socialized. The Bolsheviks couldn't just give up and \"wait until capitalism has succeeded in ruining the millions of small and medium producers and converting them into farm labourers\", nor could they outright expropriate these small and medium producers \"because it would destroy all chances of victory for the proletarian revolution, and would throw the peasantry into the camp of the enemies of the proletariat for a long time\". Collectivization was the pragmatic compromise. But since collective ownership is not social ownership, it necessitated commodity production as exchange through purchase and sale was \"the form of economic tie with the town which is *alone acceptable* to the peasants\".)  \n  \nThis all goes back to the debate over the uneven development of capital. The Bolsheviks knew how underdeveloped (relatively speaking) Russia was, and was hoping on a western revolution to help it. But when this didn't happen, they knew they couldn't just bank everything on a revolution in the industrialized west, it needed to rapidly industrialize itself in order to build socialism internally so far as it could be done, even if that meant tolerating commodity production. China unfortunately does not have the primary resources per capita that Russia had in order to rapidly industrialize so it must deal with this problem in a different way, which it is doing. How it will all work? I have no idea. I *choose* to be optimistic (despite some skepticism), if only because the state of the western left is in such a pitiful place, fraught with all sorts of opportunistic frauds and liberal imperialists. \n  \n","created_utc":1539837332,"score":17,"subreddit":"communism"}

And it is due to that legacy that allows them to maintain such power. \n\nHowever EFF, a party which has existed for only 5 years, has risen to being the third largest party, actively educates it's members on Marx, Lenin, and Fanon. We as EFFSC have won many (most) of the university councils this year, indicating that the educated youth believe in the policy of the EFF. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, no one else was prepared to do what needed to be done, to make a noise, to take action. That alone has lead to certain groups vilifying the EFF out of fear. Hence certain rumours and issues you might have heard. \n\nOverall in my opinion as someone who only joined the party in January of this year, I believe the EFF is the best option to a socialist South Africa.","created_utc":1539877386,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

I can easily imagine in the Third World, a right-wing government propaganda campaign showing off their full store shelves, but no one in their media being able to acknowledge their higher than regional average malnutrition rates.\n\nIf everyone could take what they individually (or their family collectively) needed for the day, stocks would be empty by the end of day because every item would have been taken. What's the critique? The stocks are replenished overnight for the next day.\n\nThe only way a person would take more than they needed, excluding any irrational motive, is if they took more than they could use (in this case, eat) and then tried to hoard it in a bid to sell it, concentrate wealth, and build their own private business infrastructure.

I don\u2019t at all think revolution in first-world countries is impossible. In fact, I think that, had communist parties made certain strides in some situations (i.e., the recent 2008 financial crisis), a lot more attention could\u2019ve been brought to our cause. It\u2019s our responsibility to not only prepare for revolutionary situations, but also to help create the conditions for them.\n\nSo, what keeps people in the first world from having socialist revolutions? In truth, we\u2019ve already seen that the first world has revolutionary potential. That\u2019s why social democracy was introduced in Europe and the New Deal in the U.S. The key problem is that the proletariat in the West is kept fattened by the spoils of imperialism. We see that people in the West by and large are well-fed, can afford to live, etc. In other words, most people perceive things to be \u201cgood enough.\u201d If people have problems but are still more or less content with the status quo, the conditions for a revolutionary situation objectively don\u2019t exist. The reason the oppressed countries have so much revolutionary potency is because, in Stalin\u2019s words, the contradictions of capitalism are pushed to the maximum in imperialism. People under imperialist rule face the harshest of repression, the most brutal exploitation, and some of the world\u2019s absolute worst living conditions.\n\nOther issues are rampant as well. On top of all this, we in the West in particular are in the heartland of imperialism. It\u2019s very easy for our parties to be infiltrated by anti-Marxists and revisionists, for our activities to be outlawed, and for popular support to be vastly in favor of the bourgeois governments.

ANC policy is the distribution of unused state owned land, but doesn't even look at the fact that almost all farmland is still owned by the same families that owned it pre 94. DA just gives title deeds to shacks and government built very very low income housing to the residents but doesn't even look at white owned land because white farmers either vote DA or VF+ \n\nWhilst I think we are limited by operating within the existing system, the material conditions here are such that race overrides class to a great degree. White people are 8% of the country and of that only 1.6% of white people live in poverty. Combine that with fanons writings on the mental disturbance caused by being a colonised subject and you have a country in which the material conditions are complex and need to be navigated in a manner appropriate to that specific context.\n\nI can't speak for the whole party, but from what I've seen, we're doing real work. Insourcing workers, getting pay raises, assisting SAFTU (union), making racists afraid, and not being afraid to support Palestine outwardly, to take strong stances against gender based violence, and so forth. For me as an ML, this party has shown time and time again that it is a powerful force, and a force that is practical. \n\nHowever as MLs we must always consider interests. Why are other parties so quick to say the EFF isn't serious about land redistribution , is it true, or is it because it is an attempt to detract from their support base with rumours and telling everyone \"no they don't have your interests at heart but xyz does come vote of us\"","created_utc":1539888388,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

Each defeat weakens imperialism by eating away at the ability of imperialists to extract resources and superprofits. Superprofits which are necessary to keeping the imperialist machine running smoothly. The superprofits of imperialism, aside from allowing the welfare state in the west, more significantly allow it to become hyper-militarized through trillions of dollars worth of military development (R&amp;D, weapons\/artillery production, infrastructure\/logistics) and the resulting weapons and technology, not to mention almost a century of constant practice fighting modern \"insurgencies\" all over the globe (experience is one of the most valuable assets in war). The US is considered \"the richest\" country, it's also the military enforcer of the imperialist era of capitalism while being the most oppressive (of *the west*) to its own people due in no small part to kickbacks and shiny new toys from the defense industry. This is not a coincidence.   \n  \nEvery defeat of imperialism saps away at the massive superprofits necessary to sustain itself, forcing it to spread itself thin. This weakens the imperialist state apparatus, both in imperialist adventures and at home. Defeats are also dangerous multipliers. There is a reason the US spends so much in *seemingly* inconsequential conflicts: every defeat is a contributor to a potential domino effect.   \n  \nThe longer Americans allow its state to fight all over the world the longer it is giving this same force time to sharpen the exact blades which will be used against them (their original purpose) when the time comes. The defeat of this force is the prerequisite for any lasting movement, and any Americans who cheer on its military's intervention, or views such interventions with indifference, are cheering on the defeat of themselves, because this force is *their enemy too*.

{"author":"ZestyZasta","body":"Well it happens in all socio-economic systems, as the productive forces (or economic base) dictate the social relations that will exist in society. In capitalism the productive forces are owned by individual capitalists, thus those that control the material means of production have under their control the ideological means of production as well. That means laws, education, state apparatuses, etc. all of these will exist in such a way to defend the ownership of capital in favour of the individual capitalists. However, at the same time these processes are occurring, the proletariat must be more and more educated in order to operate the machines, factories, equipment, computers, etc. to maintain this system. Thus, the system MUST give them this knowledge, which of course lays the seeds for revolutionary ideas to come forward.  \n\n\nFor example, the British arrived in India and colonised it successfully, however in order to more efficiently exploit the Indian resources and people, they had to build roads, railways, schools, universities, etc.  This leads to the development of an educated segment of the Indian population in order to better manage the Indian colony, however, this newly formed intelligentsia begins to demand national independence from the British in order to build their own national identity and own national bourgeoisie. (this is an example of a national bourgeois revolution, but an applicable example of a progressive revolution nonetheless). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you see [this](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/alsauksupa111.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d4350a96aa7872c941fc50ed509684d5ae5aaaa) image, you can see approximately what Marx is referring to.

But there are documents that are verified to have been written or dictated by Lenin that have him backing Stalin for party Leadership.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nStalin being an Authoritarian is also a grey area, he tried to resign four times but the rest of the leadership wouldn't let him. He regularly tried to make things more democratic but was knocked back every time. The terror campaigns were orchestrated by Yezhov, and we don't know if Stalin actually knew about them. The Authoritarian image of the USSR comes from Democratic Centralism, where a committee would discuss and vote on a matter freely, but once that vote was passed, everyone had to back the winning side. This doesn't mean you couldn't bring it up at the next meeting if the plan wasn't working. Freedom of Debate, Unity of Action. And that there was only one Party and one person on the ballot at elections, which is an over simplification, as almost everyone was a member of the party, and candidates were pre-selected in meetings by the electorate, not the party, and then the election was a final check to see if everyone approved of the candidate.

Maoism is Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, Leninism is Marxism-Leninism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Communist Manifesto's 10 points are a starting point, and an Idea of some of the changes communist parties would want to make if they were elected into a capitalist government. But they aren't representative of Communism as a Stateless, Classless, Moneyless society. Generally most communists would approve of all those things, but they don't make up communism or socialism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou do not need to slaughter the bourgeoisie, by all means sieze their private property, but you don't need to do anything overtly violent to them unless they start actively working against the Revolution.

The \"rendering those involved in its promotion liable to expulsion.\" is true for any line a party has, as not adhering to it is breaking DemCen, just as if they had comrades promoting Remain in the EU they would face discipline. \n\nNor do I think it is saying you can't be gay or trans or defend their rights and be in the party, but advocating queer theory is what they mean by 'LGBT ideology', which is agreeable, LGB+T people sure face discrimination but I don't think their oppression is linked to capitalism in the UK. I feel they have kept to motion deliberately vague so it appeases both sides of the argument\n\nAlthough you could argue that it can still be an applicable means to draw people into the class struggle which you could criticise them for.\n\nIdk why you bring up Sankara as if they (CPGB-ML) don't care about women's liberation, they publish a book titled \"Marxism and the Emancipation of Women\" which is a collection of articles criticising liberal feminism and the promotion of Marxist feminism. I've read a lot of articles from them that promote the idea women can not be free under capitalism,for instance they still supported the right to have abortions and such in the north of Ireland, which isn't really leaving it till after the revolution like you sugested.\n\nIdk why you feel the need to put \"white\" in their as if that is somehow the sole reason they have this conclusion, when a lot of their leadership is Punjabi - it seems to just be attacking them for who they are rather their opinions. I hope people stop using this kinda rhetoric, it doesn't really add anything, I'm half expecting to get called a cis het chauvinist for having these opinions despite that I'm trans and bi\n\nI find it strange that you think one single line can make or break an entire party, every vanguard that has lead revolutions has been anti LGB+T, far, *far* more so than this motion.

The current vogue for identity politics\u2014especially those revolving around sex and gender\u2014is simply extreme liberalism and relies on a theory of subjectivity that is wholly at odds with Marxist thought on the historical constitution of persons.

The struggles of women and colonized peoples (including internal colonies such as black Americans) should continue to be centered simply because we are anti-capitalists and capitalism historically and contemporarily relies on vast amounts of un- and undercompensated labor from these groups.  Capitalism cannot be smashed without the liberation of women and colonized peoples.  The oppression of certain other marginalized identity groups, however, is not integral to capitalism and is therefore not of primary concern to communists.

As a ML militant in Brazil, I might add interesting perspectives to the discussion, since people here are very conservative.\n\nThe LGBT section in our party knows that their objective is to make working people understand that LGBT people are not a threat to them. This fits inside the ML notion that the vanguard should elevate the class consciousness of the working class i.e. teach them that the real enemy are not LGBT people, but the bourgeoisie. We have a pretty big problem here. We are the leading country in LGBT murders in the world. People associate homosexuality, for example, with promiscuity, with pedophilia, abuse and so on. \n\nGiven that, we have to approach the movement with caution. That's why we avoid the oversexualization of political LGBT acts, like the liberals many times do, as a kind of show off or as a naive attempt of facing the common sense. That kind of thing, unfortunately, shocks most people and makes them despise LGBT people even more. \n\nThe same thing goes with other things like drug policies, abortion rights, incarceration policies and so on. \n\nA level of flexibility is understandable, but saying that there is an LGBT *ideology* is, in my view, already anti-marxist. Sexuality is just an expression of human nature, not an ideology. Calling it an ideology is not materialist.

One of the big reasons why racism, sexism, and transphobia exist on the scale that they do and are so heavily institutionalized is that they're useful to capitalism because they divide the proletariat and make it harder for us to stand in solidarity with one another. Pushing away other oppressed peoples simply because they're trying to fight for their own rights within the unfair system that we all live is exactly what the capitalists want. I would imagine that some liberal identitarians believe what they believe due mostly to the fact that they haven't been exposed to communist theory at all. I can actually attest to this being the case for at least some people because my mother was like this, she was a liberal feminist before I introduced her to communist theory and now she's not exactly a communist, but she accepts that capitalism is at fault for many feminist problems.

{"author":"TheBritishJacobin","body":"Hi, member of the CPGB-ML here. I've literally created an account just to reply to this. \n\nFirstly I would like the OP (preferably in PMs) to tell me where they got this information from. This has not been made public yet, it has only appeared in our bulletin today which is only accessible to candidates and full members. It's not a huge deal and I doubt many in the party will care that this has been posted on reddit but I would encourage whoever is leaking infomation to stop as it helps nobody. \n\nSecondly I'd like to point out that this motion does not mean gay and trans people are not welcome in the party. Quite the opposite, we fight against discrimination wherever it occurs and seek to unite the working-class. We have many LGBT+ comrades in the party (I am bisexual myself) and this motion was passed with several LGBT+ comrades in the room. \n\nThirdly I'd like to talk a bit about identity politics. People are quite right to point out that identity politics was a term coined by the Combahee River Collective. However, just because they were socialists does not mean they necessarily had correct views and doesn't mean it reflects what identity politics has become today. As anyone who has any experience with identity politics will tell you how divisive it is. It is a new weapon that has been used by liberals to obscure class and to place identity over all else. It has been used to mask gains for the bourgeoisie as gains for the proletariat. The fact that Obama and Hillary have used their identity to present themselves as 'radical' options whilst being completely anti-proletariat and neoliberal should be evidence of the aims of identity politics. \n\nEven in activism, many a group has been splintered because black comrades refused to work with white comrades or gay with straight or women with men, etc. I think we should always look to Fred Hampton when we talk about issues like this who said, \"We say you don't fight racism with racism. We're gonna fight racism with  solidarity. We say you don't fight capitalism with no black capitalism;  you fight capitalism with socialism.\"\n\nIf you're in Britain and you're still unsure and still unmoved by what I've said I say - come join us anyway. If you agree with 99% of what we say but disagree with our stance here, then join. We are not an amorphous mass of people who all think the same way, we have had many disagreements in our party on many issues. However we always come out stronger on the other side because we adhere to Marxism-Leninism and democratic centralism. If you think we're wrong and this is a setback to the communist movement in Britain then join and argue your case. The only way you're going to get a true feel for us is to meet us in person and decide for yourselves. ","created_utc":1539977893,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

The old political orientations are dead: the center cannot hold. While others offer social democratic fantasy from a past that cannot return, we bring you instead the future, a magazine of politics and culture that knows what so many already intuitively recognize: capitalism can\u2019t be made more tolerable, couldn\u2019t be saved even if we wanted to, and won\u2019t be voted away. We take our inspiration from the movements of our time, publishing writing that reflects and clarifies the creative intelligence at work within them. The answers are in the streets.\n\nWe aim to become an indispensable feature of left politics in the US and a lighthouse for revolutionaries. Our editorial policy is non-dogmatic and multi-tendency. We do not adhere, as editors, to a particular strain of revolutionary thinking, but rather to a broad set of parameters that we believe are increasingly accepted by tens of millions of people: that the miseries of capitalism cannot be overcome except by revolution; that the state is a machine for oppression rather than a tool that can be used by revolutionaries; that the ecological crisis will intensify the urgency of the revolutionary project, putting into question the mere survival of hundreds of millions if not billions of people; that the structures of domination we name race and gender are integrally bound up with capitalist class society.\n\nWhile there has been some opening for radical ideas with the advent of publications such as Jacobin, the politics on display there and elsewhere fall short, for the most part, of the sensibilities found in the significant social movements of our time. There are massive numbers of people who understand, intuitively, which way the wind is blowing and find foolish polite social democracy and flirtation with poisonous Democrats. At the same time, the ideas that we believe resonate with such people can only be found in marginal, jargon-laden, and aesthetically restrictive magazines destined for denizens of small political milieus and subcultures. Most people will experience these venues as alienating and closed to them.\n\nHence, Commune: a journal of politics and culture that aims to showcase the most important radical voices of our moment. We will publish feature-length articles on a range of topics pertinent to the question of capitalism and its overcoming; reviews of books, movies, and other cultural products; short letters and reports from scenes of vital struggle. Our first issue will feature articles on contemporary struggles, on ecological crisis and natural disaster, on the black radical tradition, on historical antecedents of contemporary antifascism and their lessons for us, on dystopian literature, and letters from comrades all over the world.\n\nIn terms of style, we aim for clarity and intelligence in the prose we publish, and will work with writers to strip out the encumbrances of both academic and activist writing. Terms of art and theoretical terminology will be avoided or, when necessary, explained. We will not condescend to readers, who we know are far more capable than is often assumed; we will not discourage the right word, however specialized, as long as it is truly right. But we will not, by the same measure, limit our readership by in-group signaling. We want our writing to be recognized as the very best of our moment and expect that some who get their start writing for us will go on to become successful journalists on the basis of the work we published. Though we will solicit established and practiced writers, we will also endeavor to support new talent and new voices through mentorship and editing, in order to make available the creative intelligence we see all around us\u2014intelligence that, as yet, has no sympathetic outlet of sufficient scale. We understand that we need to cultivate our readership as well as our writership. This means, among other things, paying our writers for the work they do. \ufffd\ufffd\n\nTo do all of this we will need to be financially sustainable and we must publish at a certain scale and volume. You can help us by following us here and on twitter, by sharing this post and links to our articles, and by contributing to our Kickstarter in mid-October.\n\nCOMMUNE for a life worth living","created_utc":1540065931,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

Everything is sourced; the sources are accepted in the academia and they are not related to the communist movement whatsoever.\n\n&gt;  Not OP, but here are the sources for claims that starvation in Ukraine(the one thats usually referred to be intentional) was not planned by the authorities.\n&gt; \n&gt; Copy-pasting my comment from the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; Open wiki holodomor page. Go to reference #1, \"Years of Hunger\" by Davies and Wheatcroft and read in the preface of the book.\n&gt; \n&gt; In our own work we,like V.P.Kozlov,have found no evidence that the Soviet authorities undertook a programme of genocide against Ukraine. It is also certain that the statements by Ukrainian politicians and publicists about the deaths from famine in Ukraine are greatly exaggerated.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can find pdf of the book [here](https:\/\/eastsidemarxism.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/04\/r-w-davies-stephen-g-wheatcroft-the-industrialisation-of-soviet-russia-volume-5-the-years-of-hunger-soviet-agriculture-1931-1933.pdf)\n&gt; \n&gt; Another quote from this book:\n&gt; \n&gt; Russia and parts of Ukraine suffered from fairly regular serious droughts, which significantly reduced crop yields. In 1925\u201329 the weather was favorable; the only break in the years of fine weather came in 1927. Then the weather in the first year of the new decade was excellent, and confounded those statisticians who argued that a good harvest was improbable. In 1931, however, this run of good luck came to an end. The spring weather was much colder than usual; and June was warmer, and July much hotter than usual (see Table 8). The cold spring and the hot July were a deadly combination. The cold spring delayed the sowing (see p. 62) and hence the whole development of grain. The grain reached its vulnerable flowering stage later than normal, coinciding with the hot July weather. And from June the south-east suffered what is known as a sukhovei (literally, \u2018dry wind\u2019). In May\u2013July, the normal weather pattern in the Volga and BlackEarth regions and on the Ukrainian steppe was that the warm, dry, south-easterly winds from Kazakhstan gave way to colder and wetter winds from the north-west. But about once in every ten or twelve years the south-easterlies predominated throughout these months, the winds became scorching, no rain fell and the earth became parched. At these times, grain yields fell significantly and there was a risk of famine, if reserve stocks of grain were not available. The sukhovei of 1891 and 1921 brought famine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Page 68(95\/582 in pdf; link above)\n&gt; \n&gt; Quote from a book by Mark Tauger.\n&gt; \n&gt; This interpretation of the 1932-1933 famine as the result of the largest in a series of natural disasters suggests an alternative approach to the intentionalist view of the famine. Some advocates of the peasant resistance view argue that the regime took advantage of the famine to retaliate against the peasants and force them to work harder. Famine and deaths from starvation, however, began in 1928 in towns and some rural areas because of low harvests and of some peasants' unwillingness to sell their surpluses, The food supply generally deteriorated over the next few years,due not only to exports in 1930-1931 but also to the crop failures of 1931-1932. The harsh procurements of 1931 and 1932 have to be under stood in the context of famine that prevailed in towns as well as villages throughout the Soviet Union by late 1931; by 1932-1933,as noted above, workers as well as peasants were dying of hunger. If we are to believe that the regime starved the peasants to induce labor discipline in the farms, are we to interpret starvation in the towns as the regime's tool to discipline blue and white collar workers and their wives and children? While Soviet food distribution policies are beyond the scope of this article,it is clear that the small harvests of 1931-1932 created shortages that affected virtually every one in the country and that the Soviet regime did not have the internal resources to alleviate the crisis.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; [Page 48\/67](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B-eTgjCs2lzpNExnSEVhMjBLRlE\/view)\n&gt; \n&gt; And the last quote from another work of Tauger.\n&gt; \n&gt; While the leadership did not stop exports, they did try to alleviate the famine. A 25 February 1933 Central Committee decree allotted seed loans of 320000 tons to Ukraine and 240,000 tons to the northern Caucasus. Seed loans were also made to the Lower Volga and may have been made to other regions as well. Kulchytskyy cities Ukrainian party archives showing that total aid to Ukraine by April 1933 actually exceeded 560,000 tons, including more than 80,000 tons of food. Aid to Ukraine alone was 60% greater than the amount exported during the same period. Total aid to famine regions was more than double exports for the first half of 1933.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Page 20\/21](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B-eTgjCs2lzpQllPVzQ2UFd3aWM\/view)","created_utc":1540096756,"score":18,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Smashmouthfromsteve","body":"I was always one of those people who used to repeat the old rhetoric \"communism is good in theory but in practise...\" . One day some dickhead in my physics class who thinks he's really smart decided to read the communist manifesto. Due to the heavy language he declared that because he couldn't read it no-one our age on earth should read it because we wouldn't understand it. He spoke to an English teacher about it and came to the conclusion that the manifesto actually disproves communism's feasibility. Which i was incredibly confused by because i knew who Marx was . So just to spite him my friends and I decided to read it and realised how fucking ridiculous his conclusion was.\n\nI was the only one out of my friends to really become Marxist afterwards which I attribute to my family's background. Both my parents were second generation immigrants and didn't come from a place of wealth. My mother, although very critical of communism, was also extremely critical towards America and neo-liberalism and what she considered an extremely vapid culture based so heavily around consumption and advertisements, so much so that she would often remark about how American accents themselves make her cringe. So I investigated further and watched heaps of youtube videos debunking or challenging misconceptions i held about both capitalism and socialism. Every now and then I sneak my Marxist views into my family's dinner table conversations about current affairs without them knowing.\n\nAlso there's a massive flag of Che Guevara hanging up in a classroom in my school and I'm literally the only person who knows who he is.","created_utc":1540111617,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

The last time a 3rd party took power it was the Republicans during the civil war. The communist parties were officially outlawed in 1954 so other than a few intellectual die-hards there wouldn't have been anyone left.\n\nAnti-communism and fascism also never took off. The KKK picked some of it up, but there weren't any communists to get mad at, weren't that many jews either. There weren't any peasants or nobleman either. It's often quite hilarious hearing Americans bemoan the persecution of this small subset of american politics compared to the wholesale slaughter that communists saw in Europe. We complain that a few intellectuals were falsely labelled and blacklisted as communists when in Europe entire towns were leveled and cultures exterminated because they were too \"communistic\".\n\nMost of America's wealthy and elite heard about such revolts and feared it would spread into America. If you study the leaders of McCarthyism you will discover the most rabid anti Semitic holocaust denying nazi sympathizers imaginable like Henry Ford and Walt Disney. However America's right wing stratification took on a much more racial hatred than europe's which was primarily religious. You couldn't convince people the banks were run by black people who were pretending they were white like the Germans did with the Jews. Most Jews came to America to escape WW1 there were almost none in the country prior to then.\n\nThere were however millions of black people, outnumbering whites 3 to 1 in some parts. Almost all of them were christian and none of them had ever heard of communism. They certainly weren't running the newspapers or secretly in charge of the government. This was also before the civil rights movement, so \"blacklisting\" wasn't all that unheard of to begin with Blacks, Native Americans, the Irish were all discriminated against openly sometimes with signs hanging on the walls. The witchhunt known as Mccarthyism certainly added few thousand names to those lists but it's not like those employers weren't already discriminating against who they hired, they just crudely pasted \"and no communists\" to the sign that already said no Blacks, Mexicans, or Irish.\n\nI imagine the actual American communist party meetings were alot like today's... maybe a few more black people","created_utc":1540191391,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"leafycandles","body":"Tolstoy was a christian , advocate of georgism, and came from one of the wealthiest families on earth tracing their roots to the court of Peter the Great. The Tolstoy's are still a wealthy and influential family most notably the current deputy chairmen of the State Duma in Russia, and the Chancellor of the international monarchist league in the UK. Even a famous musician in Sweden, you get the picture.\n\nLeo Tolstoy himself criticized socialists, marxists, anarchists and everyone else on the left usually along  the lines of \"they're not christian enough\" He never called himself an anarchist either its more of a label attached to him after death.\n\nHis economic opinions were similar to the Luddites or the Amish he suggested abandoning all major cities and returning to agrarianism he advocated abstinence and claimed that cities  themselves caused \"debauchery\". He was about as communist as Ghandi or Martin Luther King.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"The contradictions in Tolstoy\u2019s works, views, doctrines, in his school, are indeed glaring. On the one hand, we have the great artist, the genius who has not only drawn incomparable pictures of Russian life but has made first-class contributions to world literature. On the other hand we have the landlord obsessed with Christ. On the one hand, the remark ably powerful, forthright and sincere protest against social falsehood and hypocrisy; and on the other, the \u201cTolstoyan\u201d, i.e., the jaded, hysterical sniveller called the Russian intellectual, who publicly beats his breast and wails: \u201cI am a bad wicked man, but I am practising moral self-perfection; I don\u2019t eat meat any more, I now eat rice cutlets.\u201d On the one hand, merciless criticism of capitalist exploitation, exposure of government outrages, the farcical courts and the state administration, and unmasking of the profound contradictions between the growth of wealth and achievements of civilisation and the growth of poverty, degradation and misery among the working masses. On the other, the crackpot preaching of submission, \u201cresist not evil\u201d with violence. On the one hand, the most sober realism, the tearing away of all and sundry masks; on the other, the preaching of one of the most odious things on earth, namely, religion, the striving to replace officially appointed priests by priests who will serve from moral conviction, i. e., to cultivate the most refined and, therefore, particularly disgusting clericalism.\" - V.I.

{"author":"Haldenald","body":"I think statehood legislations on Puerto Rico are a mistake, it makes much more sense in all aspects to be a free country. Puerto Ricans, from their inception, are taught by their colonizers that they are weak and frail, when really, ever since the Ta\u00edno theyve been fighting for independence fiercely. It is never taught in schools that the Ta\u00edno, with primitive weapons, nearly beat the spaniards, with the spaniards having to call for reinforcements multiple times in order to beat the Ta\u00edno. It is also never taught that in the 23rd of September, 1868, a revolution sparked the minds of colonial independence amongst the entire island, and it is never taught that in 1950, an independent insurrection movement, at a time where you could be thrown in jail and executed for merely *owning* a Puerto Rican flag, achieved great feats in pushing the cause further, which ended in great sacrifice by its leaders. And even as little as a year ago, after hurricane Mar\u00eda, Puerto Rico stood united, communities collectively went as a whole to clear roads, people cooked for entire communities in need, all economic classes ended and there was only a land of people united as one, as equals, which shows the true strength of Puerto Rican communities, and furthermore, confirms every principle past heroes and freedom fighters held regarding Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico has great potential for independence, in a land with many resources and countless other countries as allies, and it makes no sense for me to throw that all away in favour of the colonizer. Thats why the colonizer will never teach the colonized that they are strong and united, because once that happens, they lose their profit.","created_utc":1540215895,"score":21,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"predalienmack","body":"Basically, after Stalin died, the Soviet Union got rid of many of his most die hard supporters and began a campaign of revisionism to erase the memory of the positive things that happened while Stalin was in power and generally to paint him as some sort of monster. The Soviet Union also began their descent that would eventually result in their collapse with revisionist policies and gradual concessions that led towards the reemergence of market capitalism, though to be fair, by most standards, life was still pretty great in the Soviet Union for the most part until the mid to late 80s. Clearly the socialist foundation laid by the Russian Revolution and the time Stalin was in power gave the Soviet Union an incredible stepping stone towards many of their achievements in the decades after Stalin died (such as their space program, for example). \n\nStalin certainly made mistakes and wasn\u2019t perfect, but an examination of the historical facts and the gains the Soviet Union made under his leadership show why he was a positive contributor to the development of socialism in his country and around the world, which the Chinese during their revolution experienced first hand. For the Chinese leadership, seeing such a blatant campaign of propaganda demonizing a figure that had made many decisions that helped the Chinese Revolution was unacceptable, and thus the ideological split between the two superpowers happened and remained until the Soviet Union collapsed. We would be living in a very different world today if the PRC and the USSR could have reconciled their differences, with the USSR righting its course away from revisionism, but I digress: games of \u201cwhat-if\u201d like that are purposeless and a waste of time because we cannot change the past, but we can work to change the present and future.

{"author":"NeoIvan17","body":"You make an interesting argument, but I disagree with the notion that SocDemocracy is a gateway to fascism and with the idea that SocDem policies being enacted by fascists means it is a fascist policy.  \n\n\nGoing back to the Nazis and the far-right, Hitler may have given people good social programs for political support early in his rule but the main goal of SocDemocracy is more akin to a  kinder form of capitalism. Hitler never intended to do that as he gave massive power to the capitalists, the military and even some religious organizations. Using the Nazis as an example requires very close analysis versus more broad strokes (not saying you did that). Hitler may have given the people a welfare program, but by that measure didn't the Soviet Union, the U.S.A. (to a degree), Capitalist and Socialist European countries post war, Japan, China...basically the world, except the USA which didn't go far enough in SocDem if you ask me, have forms of social democracy or a welfare state? Not saying the Soviet\/Socialist countries were SocDemocracies but that they had welfare states for the good of their people (Healthcare, child care, paid leave, vacations, good jobs, etc). Maybe I am  misunderstanding your point.  \n\n\nThe main problem with Social Democracy is that it leaves capitalism in place waiting and biding it's time to eventually strike back by various means. The best examples for how Social Democracy leads to far-right movements gaining power is more in the current times of the United States, Britain, Germany, France, etc. By having the SocDems become Neoliberal capitalists and weakening if not dismantling many aspects of the welfare state, letting capitalists run wild in the economy, dismantling unions and workers rights, etc. By leaving the capitalist economic system in place you risk it making a comeback like a creeping shadow. That's what I think is ultimately wrong with the system despite it's promise of good things for the people like single-payer healthcare, child-care assistance, paid parental leave, paid sick leave, more unionization (in theory), government sponsored job programs like the WPA and other programs, strong enivornmental regulation (in theory again) and others.  \n\n\nIt is the conflict that is inherent in capitalism that to maximize profits, you can't have a welfare state in place. Of course, I could be wrong but I think Social democracy is not a bad place to be for the people. Obviously things should be better in a more socialist society, but it's far better than fascism or even neo-liberalism. Maybe.

However, I think the link between the two is more simple, at least from an economic standpoint. Social democracy and fascism are aberrations from the capitalist status quo, however, they are both capitalist through and through. The ruling class like neither of them, but they prefer them both to socialism (of course) and prefer fascism to social democracy, especially in times of crisis. The property relations in neither instances are really changed, as you say.\n\nboth, then, are a response to the threat of actual socialism, this is the main link between them, in my opinion. \n\nI think there is something in what you say about social democratic parties in the west being a stepping stone, but it is slightly different in the contemporary context than from the rise of the nazis.\n\nWithout the threat of revolution and workers power via the USSR as a counterweight to capitalist world hegemony, the use of the social democratic parties has been defanged - they were an alternative to socialism, and now they offer very little (pasokification). When in power they are effectively useless (syriza). when the left fails, fascism can thrive. \n\n\na new turn to fascism in our times is arguably a preventative measure from the ruling class, which is aware that class politics is rising to the surface again. There were clues some years ago but now it is quite obvious, with even Francis Fukuyama recently negating his end of history theory.\n\nPerhaps they are trying to strangle the Bolshevik threat in the cradle this time, to borrow from Churchill. \n\nAnyway I am ranting.

If you want the \u201cbig picture\u201d soviet view on war you absolutely need a copy of this:\n\nMarxism-leninism on war and army:\nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Marxism-Leninism-Army-Soviet-View\/dp\/141020247X\/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1540454140&amp;sr=8-1&amp;pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&amp;keywords=marxism+leninism+war+and+army&amp;dpPl=1&amp;dpID=51cS5oRMySL&amp;ref=plSrch\n\nFor a sort of general outline of the marxist theory on the use of tactics this one is worth a look but is very heavy on marxist theory:\nThe basic principles of operational art and tactics, a soviet view:\nhttps:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Basic-Principles-Operational-Art-Tactics\/dp\/1410201147\/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1540454260&amp;sr=8-1&amp;pi=AC_SX236_SY340_QL65&amp;keywords=operational+art+tactics+soviet&amp;dpPl=1&amp;dpID=41NN2KG2QBL&amp;ref=plSrch\n\nThere are a number of texts avaliable on archive.org which may help you understand the soviet mindset a bit better. Below is probably some of the most relevant (but there are more and its well worth a look):\n\nSoviet Officers handbook:\nhttps:\/\/archive.org\/details\/DTIC_ADA046591\n\nTactics:\nhttps:\/\/archive.org\/details\/DTIC_ADA183185\n\nThe initial period of the war:\nhttps:\/\/archive.org\/details\/DTIC_ADA168483\/page\/n5\n\nArmed forces of the soviet state:\nhttps:\/\/archive.org\/details\/DTIC_ADA038547\/page\/n7\n\nThe people, the army, the commander (i.e. soviet views on the role military leaders in war):\nhttps:\/\/archive.org\/details\/DTIC_ADA055587\/page\/n1\n\nThe \u201cdtic.mil\u201d address comes up alot as its declassified us military documents. https:\/\/discover.dtic.mil\n I just stuck the word \u201csoviet\u201d in to search and got this so there is \u201ceven more\u201d out there:\nhttps:\/\/search.usa.gov\/search\/docs\/?utf8=\u2713&amp;affiliate=dtic.all&amp;dc=5191&amp;query=Soviet&amp;commit=\nThe same for rand corporation (us military think tank ):\nhttps:\/\/www.rand.org\/search.html?query=Soviet\n\nAnd pdf files from www.cia.gov comes up in google search results quite a bit too. \n\nThat\u2019s probably going to drown you in primary source so enjoy! :D\n","created_utc":1540455725,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

There is no socialism without wealth and capital. Who has the capital and wealth? \nThe imperial center has it all they\u2019ve been hoarding it for centuries and enslaving entire nations with it. They stole the world with it. \n\nSo why not use their greed against them? Invite their capital over and make them play by your rules. Use the leverage you have and use your knowledge of capitalism to manipulate the west. It\u2019s a gamble but some very hard realities need to be understood before we complain about becoming capitalists allowing imperial capital to come exploit labor:\n\n*That capital is coming no matter what.*\n\nIt\u2019s coming as chains around your neck weather you allow it or not.

It is reactionary movement which in time of crisis search to re-create superstructure of pre-capitalist society.\n\nSuperstructure of liberal capitalism is similar to free market; lack of unified ideology, individualism, selfishness, hedonism, search for new ways of artistic expression, philosophies, tolerance toward different cultures, sexual liberation, gender equality, quarrelling (and corrupted) politicians  ... perhaps not all that to extreme, but all is present. To fascists, it looks chaotic, confusing, decadent, threatening.\n\nThe fascists want superstructure similar to medieval Europe. Ideological unity, once provided by church; political unity, once provided by king (fuhrer as poor imitation), hate toward different cultures (particularly: Jews). Inegalitarian, patriarchal society, in which everyone works on the common goal: strength and expansion of nation; they honor heroes, like medieval knights. It is all seen - but it has attraction to people. It is still part of our tradition and myths.\n\nIn all that, economic basis is the least important for fascists. They will accept anything that works. They experimented with classical liberalism (first years of Mussolini's age, Nazi privatization), corporate state, to Strasserites, economically left from modern social-democrats. During WWII, Russian fascists supported Stalin (of course, Stalin killed them nevertheless) and there are some \"nazbols\" now. However, it is not accidental that historically, fascists embraced more-less traditional capitalism - it was marriage of interests; if bourgeoisie is afraid they cannot get rid of dangerous socialist movement with liberal superstructures, they have no choice but to support reactionary superstructures.

{"author":"internettext","body":"The role of the involvement in the economy of the communist party has increased a lot, they extended party control to board of directors for internal private and even foreign companies.\n\nYou can say china has a capitalist mode of surplus extraction, which in a simplified way says that there is elite consumption, and that there is no polling of the working class to determine the ratio of production of capital-goods vs consumer-goods.\n\nHowever you cannot call china a capitalist country, it lacks the political economy of capitalist countries.\n\nIt's fair to say that post Mao China is revisionist, however one has to admit that Deng's policy of reform and opening up has largely delivered on the goals of keeping the communist party in power as well as advancing the means of production. (at a high environmental cost as well a social cost like enormous inequality).  You cannot compare China\u2019s development with that of post Stalin Soviet Union, which stagnated and liberalized into collapse, they are not on that track.\n\nThe cpp sais that they are building socialism, and need to become an advanced country in order to realize it, which to be fair, Marx's also saw the potential for socialism to be in advanced countries. China has what they call uneven development, basically very modern even futuristic cities, and large parts of the country that really aren't.  They also say that the class struggle is no longer the primary contradiction, they are obsessed with stability and preventing what they call repeating the century of humiliation, which happened to them in the context of imperial domination from Japan and the UK. This seems implausible even America is not capable of mounting a ground assault on Chinese territory without it getting utterly crushed. They probably are also over estimating their vulnerability in areas of espionage\/sabotage and cyberwar. So at least in that area class-struggle should still be the primary contradiction. They also say that avoiding isolation takes precedence over class-conflict, it's hard to argue with that because they do rely on oil imports, and their domestic food production would at best barely suffice if they got isolated.\n\nOne reason why XI is compared to socdems is often because of the Chinese dream rhetoric that appears similar to the American dream of the 60s. There are other parallels, like they produced similar vision of the future animations. I think it's reading tea leafs.\n\nThe hope that many have is that China will move to a more socialist economy in a few decades, and given the drastic changes in economic structure they seem to be able to facilitate it's not unreasonable to see this as possible. It's difficult to gauge this from the outside, my guess would be to look whether they go imperialist and start spaming military bases, and deploy massive military apparatus that operates in the capacity of whacking insubordinate vassal regimes, and other shenanigans like overthrowing other countries, for confirmation of full restauration of capitalism.\n\nAlso keep in mind that China is the most likely major power both able and willing to cooperate economically with countries that go full socialism with full economic planning replacing money with labour vouchers ... while a lot of other countries might attempt to assassinate your political leaders or try to drop bombs on you instead. It's nice to have this for future prospects of socialist movements around the globe. \n","created_utc":1540511819,"score":14,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"nice_try_western_spy","body":"as marxists our goal is to increase the class consciousness of the masses so that a successful popular revolution in possible, yet the general \"etiquette\" of how we go about this is never really specifically put or written down. as a result many comrades, especially newer comrades, can further alienate a person instead of increasing their class consciousness. this is definitely a discussion we must have. \n\n___\nfirstly it is important to find the proper \"soil\". i see so many comrades trying to convert their \"trump supporter dad\" or \"right-wing friend\", but the thing is we have to be selective and strategic, we have to be smart about this. lets say a comrade did try to convince their right-wing friend in the correctness of marxism, how long would that take? well probably a while, this person is ingrained into a ideology and frame of thought very alien to ours, it will take months if not years for this person to come to terms. now lets say we are smart about this, instead of finding literally the hardest most rigid brick wall that we know how about we find someone who already sympathizes or is at least closer in thought to us? using this method we could possible educate five people in the span that it would take to just get a crack into that right-winger. lets not spend time beating a brick wall when we could just, with some minor education, nudge a few sympathizers to our side. some soil is just too salty to plant in. \n\nthe main take away is that we must be strategic in who we choose to educate. \n____\n\nsecondly it is important that we find the proper way to educate an individual. everyone is different and the path you take to helping them understand and increase their class consciousness will be different for everyone, but there are a few things to keep in mind: \n\n1. be respectful: we are not here to bully people or tell them how dumb they are for supporting Obama or who ever, we are here to teach them, and we have to act like teachers. \n\n2. understand them: put yourself in their shoes, understand how the things you are saying may come off, understand how difficult it may be for them to grasp the things you are saying. \n\n3. you can't force people to believe in things:  it is important to understand that the ultimate decision whether or not to become a marxist  is up to them, not you. pushing and pushing will not always ensure this, and you have to respect that, and know that at the end of the day it is their choice, their decision. \n\nalong with this we must also be able to read a situation, for instance maybe one person better responds to real life examples and another response better to statistics and sources. it is up to you to read the situation and be able to steer your approach in the proper direction. if they are a worker for instance or come from a worker family then use that to highlight how capitalism has failed them, just use what you know about them (in this case a family member or friend might be beneficial, but keep in mind my first point and that just because they are family doesn't mean they are always the proper \"soil\"). \n\n____\nfinally we have to know what to teach them. lets say you found  a good person to teach and you are aware of them and you are respectful, but now where to do you start? do you jump into Capital and just start reciting chapters, or do you talk about collectivization in the USSR? again we must think strategically about this. first we must destroy capitalism for them, we must destroy it and then offer up a replacement: marxism. talk about global warming and how 70% of it is caused by corporations, talk about capitalism in the 3rd world and how nothing has really changed, talk about the kids dying in the streets because capitalism doesn't care about people. once we have soiled capitalism for them then it must be replaced with something, offer up marxism as a alternative. again we must think strategically about this. if we start off saying \"no no no, see actually stalin didn't kill all those people you've just been lied to for your whole life\" well that doesn't always come off well, and is hard to understand. this is because they lack the theory, the understand of ruling class and how they propagate against marxism. for someone to understand stalin they must first understand his ideology ie marxism. start with theory, teach them about marxism and its key concepts. teach them about class and class struggle and how that reverberates throughout history. teach them about the bourgeois and how they formed a state around them. they must first have a understanding of theory to then understand history. then you can move on to how that theory has been put into practice ie history. teach them about the proto-socialists, teach them about marx and engels, teach them about the paris commune, teach them about the russian revolution. we must go step by step instead of just dropping the piano on them and expecting them to understand what we are saying. \n\n____\nwith all of this in mind we can properly educate the masses and increase their class consciousness so that a revolution will be possible. \n\n(if any comrades have any criticisms, please go ahead and let me know of them) ","created_utc":1540518237,"score":76,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"DoctorWasdarb","body":"Liberal feminism, radical feminism, and Marxist feminism are all inadequate on their own. Capitalism-imperialism is a global system, and as such, patriarchy has been expanded not as a bunch of isolated national patriarchies, but to a single global patriarchy. I may be overly sympathetic to radical feminism as a trans woman (that's because a lot of trans activism tends to be way too liberal), but some of their analyses are on point. Patriarchy is about the exploitation of female reproductive labor, gender is the tool by which it is perpetuated, etc. Many of their solutions are deeply problematic, but their core analysis has some validity, especially concerning first world, modernized countries.\n\nHowever, think about class. Even if you live in a feudal society and want to abolish class, historical materialism teaches that you can't make that leap. Capitalist development must come first (or New Democratic state-capitalism, in many cases). Similarly, capitalist development creates the conditions for the abolition of patriarchy. But while we have a global capitalist system, that development is centralized in a small number of countries. Anti-imperialist\/anti-capitalist struggle for third world development is more precisely what will create the conditions for the abolition of patriarchy. Going back to the beginning, patriarchy is a global system, and while most of the world is still in semi-feudalism, you can't abolish patriarchy.\n\nFurthermore, liberal feminism, for all its flaws, does demonstrate one thing: capitalist modernization, as experienced in the first world, while it doesn't abolish patriarchy (far from it), it does quantitatively improve the rights of women. Feudal marriage is atrocious, even when compared to capitalist marriage. Ultimately, feminist struggle needs to be rooted in the anti-imperialist struggle against lumpendevelopment in the third world if it wants to be successful.\n\nI wrote an essay about this.

{"author":"thesillandria","body":"Although I agree with you that a lot of trans activism is largely liberal, I do have to to disagree with some of your analysis and statements. For instance, you speak of a \"single global patriarchy,\" however this can very easily be seen as a reductive stance on global power relations, one in where differing and varied material and ideological forces become hidden under a unitary power, one that seems to transcend particular material conditions. Within this reduction, we must rely upon a universalizing idealization of patriarchy in order to comprehend gender discourse, a move that is quite different from Marx and, in actuality, more in line with Hegel. (Though even Hegel recognized various differing forms in which Reason could manifest in particular situations and cultures.)\n\nGender itself is, first and foremost, ideological, including any conception of sex. The actual material forms of sexual production--that of two individuals with the functional \"pair\" of sexual organs--is the best starting point for a material analysis, however anything beyond these simple statements of fact become immersed in ideological discourse. Yes, it takes \"male\" and \"female\" bodies to reproduce sexually but capitalist exploitation is based much less *on* this fact than on the ideological weight that it carries on the family at large. \"The\" family is important for property inheritance and for the continuation of the father's name which carries much ideological weight in pre-capitalist societies, and in captialism itself becomes the hegemonic purpose to sexuality, allowing a constant supply of workers reared with unpaid labor.\n\nHowever, this means that women's oppression lies less directly in material means--one could argue that toxic masculinity as described by more liberal feminists itself stems directly from these material means as well--and much more in the ideological realm in which gender discourse takes place. In other words, women (and men) are ideological subjects, whereas workers are material subjects, bound much more closely to material production than their placement within a gendered discourse. This does not mean that women are not oppressed, rather it means that our oppression lies at a more abstract level than pure class oppression.\n\nIt is precisely this abstraction that allows for the proliferation of liberal feminism and pro-capitalist feminism at large because it allows us to question gender itself without necessarily having to question capitalism itself.","created_utc":1540580327,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"DoctorWasdarb","body":"Interesting points. I can understand why one could find the analysis of a global patriarchy as reductionist, especially if the analysis were to be made from a radfem basis, treating patriarchy as the fundamental contradiction. I don't believe that's what my analysis suggests, though, and feel free to flesh out your objection. I'm not saying that global patriarchy is our primary target, only that capitalism-imperialism has rendered patriarchy global.\n\nHere are a couple facts that I think support my view, although they certainly can lead somewhere else. The first is about intersectionality. The oppression faced by third world women is greater than the sum of both imperialism and patriarchy. On the other hand, first world women don't face the same severity of patriarchy. Patriarchy certainly acts differently in both societies, but the ways patriarchy acts in the first world and the third world are deeply interconnected due to imperialism.\n\nThe second fact I bring up is how many pre-capitalist societies had third genders, tolerated more diverse sexuality, etc. However, European pre-capitalist society didn't, and this aspect of European patriarchy adopted a global status. A case could be made that pre-capitalist societies can tolerate gender diversity, whereas capitalist society cannot, and such an analysis would be coherent with observed reality. Perhaps my bias is against this analysis because I haven't been exposed to it being expressed adequately.\n\nI don't really understand why you're saying that gender is first and foremost ideological. It's less about the discourse we have, and more about the relationship between people in society. Women and men are not more or less ideological subjects than workers and capitalists. I certainly agree with the materialist discourse that workers are more bound to material production than to gender. But when we talk about patriarchy, it's not just in an abstract ideological discourse. It's about the exploitation of female reproductive labor. Again, I agree with the materialist discourse that the reproductive labor does not take precedence over productive labor, but it's still not abstract. Patriarchy has serious material roots to be addressed. My overarching argument, stemming from the notion of a global patriarchy, is that the material conditions for the abolition of patriarchy can't be met within the context of imperialist underdevelopment. And the exploitation of all women, first world and third world, can't be resolved until the underdeveloped third world successfully detaches from imperialism and develops industrialized modernity.\n\nRecognizing the material roots of patriarchy is important for another main reason, being that if we ignore it, it would be possible for patriarchy to continue to exist into socialism and communism. Hell, it could anyway, because we will learn about the mistakes in our analysis as we progress. To ignore the material roots of patriarchy would be to say that abolishing class exploitation of production would abolish exploitation of reproductive labor, which is a stretch.","created_utc":1540582472,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

I'd like to point out that your source doesn't prove that those pre-mature deaths were state-sponsored (aside from the executions). It isn't suprising that there were so many executions considering the fact that China carries out more judicial executions than any other country and there are, if memory serves correctly, 46 crimes that carry the death penalty. But no, it couldn't be that. It must be a conspiracy.\n\nYour arguement really lacks intellectual rigour or honesty. You've dismissed evidence that contradicts your claim by labelling it anti-Chinese instead of engaging with the claims and ignored the claims you couldn't brush off as anti-Chinese with ad-hominem claims of conspiracy theorising.\n\nThe process I described in my example is well supported by research. The process of political into economic capital conversion in China is well documented as are the wide-spread theft of state assets and the formation of patronage networks of cadre capitalists. This is the opposite of conspiracy.\n\nIt is not about Chinese being stupid, it is about limiting their opportunity to know anything beyond the official narrative. Even when people think for themselves, there is next to no way to publicly contradict the official line. Real-time online censorship, propaganda department issued media rules, strict laws against public disturbances alongside more traditional tools such as police harrassment and loss of employment all prevent anyone but the bravest from challenging policies. Those people end up in prison for \"picking quarrels\" (which is an actual charge in China).\n\nThis brings me to sources. What would it take for a source to convince you that the CPC is doing something dodgy? If it is critical and published in the West then it is \"anti-china\" (unless it publishes favourable statistics, then it is proof of China's greatness). Criticism of \"sensitive topics\" is impossible to publish in China, so what kind of authoratative source is possible? Such restrictions only leave anecdotes. If anecdotes are admissable as evidence then I can give personal examples of many of the points raised in the FT article.\n\nCriticisms of Opening and Reform era China are not new.

{"author":"ImInLoveWithLife","body":"It's a combination of factors, but the biggest three contributing to my acceptance of communism would be: \n\nThe class I was born into - Watching my parents work as hard as they had, and still only scraping by. Sometimes we were okay, but there were absolutely times that we had to go without a few meals to ensure we could pay the water bill. \n\nThe fact that my parents taught me, or at the very least allowed me to question my circumstances and culture - My parents love America, and in many ways are your typical Americans, but they were not upset with me when I chose not to go to church or when I was reading some politically radical literature. In fact they encouraged it. They would not spend the time on it, but if I had that opportunity, I absolutely should think about everything. To quote my father, \"God gave you a fucking brain. Use it!\" Unfortunately, there has been a divide between him and I, because I have definitely been a lot more vocal, and I think he thought any REAL deviation would just be a phase. \n\nMy personal working struggles - When I was younger, before I knew anything, I was under the impression that the struggles of my household would not be my struggles. I was witness to the rise of the personal computer and automation of production. Those things alone would transform the working world, and certainly they have, but not necessarily for the betterment of all. Just as my parents struggled, I was going to, too. The companies I worked for increasing their profits year after year, and empty pockets for me. And of course it isn't all about the money. The threat of losing the means to survive is held over all of us. Simple mistakes exaggerated and people thrown out with the waste baskets.\n\nTo summarize, I would say it is a combination of my upbringing, the information I have been exposed to, and mine and my fellow humans continuing struggles, especially in a world that could have so much more for everyone.\n\n","created_utc":1540627905,"score":15,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"RedactedCommie","body":"Human rights and free speech are western inventions used to create a cause for invading other countries. Notice how Human rights don't concern themselves with healthcare, free education, affordable or free housing? Free speech is a myth. Not only do all western countries have laws and agencies designed to attack bon-liberal ideologies but Marxist-Leninist nations outlaw free speech simply because it's a material reality that allowing liberals and fascist to speak their minds will create unrest and possibly lead to counter revolution which means more patriarchy, more wage slavery, and more hardship. \n\nInstead Marxist-Leninist look at freedom from a material perspective. A \"free\" person with no home, shelter, or say in government isn't really free. A person living in an authoritarian society where they have a serious say in things, food, shelter, education and so on however has more freedom because they're actually able to take time to pursue goals and ambitions \n\nAnyways the Capitalist mode of production is a necessary stage in Human development. It's a sad grimdark harsh reality that genocide, wage slavery, rape, and so on is unavoidable. For China to defeat capitalism they had to sell themselves out in order to get the west to essentially hand over technology, industry, and to get the west to be even more reliant on southern production than they already were 40 years ago. This allows the CPC to build up China into a super power without being isolated, invaded, or without taking the risk of trying to modernize to western standards in total isolation. As they become more modernized socialism gets stronger with the best example being the rising importance and prevelence of SOEs (state owned enterprises). \n\nSomething I think western leftist and particularly anarchist forget is people from the global South don't consistantly chose authoritarian socialism out of a selfish desire for power but because strong authoritarian states are the only socialist societies that can survive against NATO. The idea of communism is great but survival and winning class war comes first and it's a simple fact anarchist historically have been unable to ever mount a large scale war against a western power.

{"author":"DoctorWasdarb","body":"I've long noticed that both sides of the debate around Stalin are far too liberal. Both sides focus too much on the successes and failures of the Soviet Union as the personal exploits of Stalin, rather than as the result of dialectical interaction between internal contradictions in Russia and the Soviet Union. Did the USSR have success? To some degree, absolutely, especially in the immediate, up until the war against international fascism. But these successes came from class struggle, not led by one man or a couple men, but by the Russian proletariat. Stalin was simply their representative.\n\nHowever, Leninism failed to fully eradicate the liberalism of the Second International, and that plagued many of their actions. Two come to mind, the first being their absurd anti-multicultural policy on the National Question, and the second being how Stalin tended to view opposition to Soviet socialist power as saboteurs, not as representatives of the nascent bourgeoisie. He was not a great representative.\n\nBut lastly, the question of Soviet failure is then reduced by Stalin's supporters to the Khrushchevite coup, rather than focusing on social conditions and social forces. What about the contradiction between the necessity for proletarian power, yet also for the development of the productive forces? You can't build socialism overnight. Conditions have to be met. (See Mao's On New Democracy, just as applicable to Russia as it was to China. Russia was semi-feudal, semi-colonial, like China.) An analogy can be made to the French Revolution, in that both were incredibly forward looking, but failed to recognize that such a future is not possible yet. They tried to do too much too quickly.\n\nThe failure of the Soviet system is due to Khrushchev and Gorbachev and Yeltsin, no doubt about it. They could have reformed the USSR to the left, but they chose not to. Reform was necessary, though. However, Lenin and Stalin and Leninism are also partly to blame, not to any fault of theirs, but because they were the first successful revolution, so they were bound to make an abundance of errors.\n\nBut at the end of the day, it's not about individuals, it's about social forces.","created_utc":1540654433,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"PigInABlanketFort","body":"http:\/\/www.massline.org\/Dictionary\/EN.htm#entryism\n\n&gt; The tactic of a political group or trend entering en masse into another, usually larger, organization in order to try to influence its policies and actions, or even to take complete control of it. Another motive has sometimes been to enter the larger group just short term, try to win over some of its members to the infiltrating group\u2019s point of view, and then to split again but now with a larger number of people. (Trotskyists call this raiding scheme \u201chaving a split perspective\u201d.) Of course entryism is almost always done against the wishes of the target organization, and sometimes with great secrecy and subterfuge to hide the fact that the infiltrators are part of a unified group with ulterior motives. Although all sorts of political trends have at various times and places used the tactic of entryism, or something like it, it is especially associated with the maneuvers of the Trotskyists.\n&gt;         \n&gt; Entryism got its start with \u201cthe French Turn\u201d proposal of Leon Trotsky himself in June 1934, that the French Trotskyists should dissolve their own tiny middle-class organization and join the French Section of the Workers\u2019 International (SFIO). (The SFIO was the party that was created in 1905 when the French Socialist Party and the Socialist Party of France merged. In 1920 a majority of the SFIO split to form the Communist Party of France (CPF). So by 1934 the remaining SFIO was the right-wing remnant of the original social-democratic party.) After some discord, the French Trotskyists did follow Trotsky\u2019s direction and entered the SFIO in August 1934, forming an essentially independent faction there (in effect, a party within a party). However, in 1936 Trotsky insisted that his followers bolt from the SFIO and form their own separate party again. This was done in a disorganized fashion, and only about 600 people left the SFIO in this split. Some Trots considered this whole \u201cFrench Turn\u201d to have been a failure while others considered it to be a \u201csuccess\u201d since they came out of the SFIO with more members than they entered with. However, during this period of political turmoil most political parties gained a lot of strength, and to a far greater degree than the tiny Trotskyist faction or party did. The French Trotskyists played no significant social role during the 1930s and were completely dispersed during World War II. It wasn\u2019t until the 1950s that they began to make a small reappearance.\n&gt;         \n&gt; Trotskyists have tried entryism in other countries as well. In 1936 the American Trots entered the Socialist Party of America (another middle class social-democratic party!) and formed their own faction around the newspaper Socialist Appeal. But they were expelled in 1937 and then formed their own group, the so-called Socialist Workers Party, in 1938. In Britain the Trotskyists entered the mainline Independent Labour Party and then the Labour Party, but left in 1944 to form their own organization. Somewhat more successfully (from their own perspective) was the longer-term entryist project of the Trotskyist \u201cMilitant Tendency\u201d which infiltrated the Labour Party beginning in the 1950s and eventually managed to gain control of its Young Socialists group and the Liverpool Council of the Labour Party\u2014before being expelled in the 1980s. Similar schemes, generally with less persistance and success, have been used by Trots in Belgium, Canada, the Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland. In general, the question of whether to use \u201centryism\u201d, or not, has been a highly divisive issue within Trotskyism ever since Trotsky first proposed it in 1934. As a solidly middle-class political trend, Trotskyism has been even more internally divided and sectarian than the \u201cleft\u201d in general has been since World War II, and this issue has further amplified their already ultra-strong petty-bourgeois sectarian tendencies.\n&gt;         \n&gt; In the late 1960s the Progressive Labor Party in the U.S. infiltrated the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). This was not quite a pure form of \u201centryism\u201d because the PLP itself also continued as a separate party. But they did manage to achieve a majority influence in SDS which then split into two organizations, one of which was completely controlled by PLP. In combination with the already existing internal problems in the old SDS (especially anarchism and ultra-leftism), this \u201chostile take-over\u201d and splitting of the group, ended up destroying what was once an extremely important revolutionary student organization in the U.S. So while this entryist maneuver was successful from the organizational point of view of the PLP, it was disastrous for the American revolutionary movement. The PLP was nominally \u201cMaoist\u201d at the time, but for a variety of good reasons many actual Maoists considered it (then and now) to be more like a \u201cTrotskyite group without Trotsky\u201d.\n&gt;         \n&gt; For many years the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an organization of \u201cleft\u201d-liberal reformists, has been attempting to pursue a policy of what amounts to entryism. While it exists as a separate organization, it does not even try to be a real political party. Instead it encourages its members to work within the Democratic Party (one of the two main ruling class parties in the U.S.), rather than trying to establish itself as a viable \u201cthird party\u201d within the American electoral system. This is the tactic that Bernie Sanders and some other phony \u201csocialist\u201d politicians have been using. While a few such people have managed to get elected, it makes little difference even when they are. They still defend and support the basic American capitalist-imperialist system. This is an example of how \u201centryism\u201d can in effect become an excuse for not really opposing capitalism and imperialism at all.\n&gt;         \n&gt; It is sometimes said that the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s entrance into the Nationalist Party (Guomindang) in the 1920s was an example of \u201centryism\u201d. However, if so this is far from a typical case and there were a number of important special circumstances involved. Sun Yat-sen and the GMD actually arranged for this CCP participation as part of an agreement to receive help from the Soviet Union to complete the bourgeois revolution in China and unify the country. Still, if this is nevertheless regarded as an example of \u201centryism\u201d, it must surely be one of the most disastrous cases ever: When the GMD viciously turned on the CCP in 1927 it helped facilitate the massacre of many thousands of Communists.\n&gt;         \n&gt; Is there ever a truly good reason for actual Marxist-Leninist-Maoists to employ the tactic of entryism? It seems unlikely. However, we should also recall our hostility to Kantian-like absolute principles that hold everywhere and always, and regardless of specific circumstances. Marxism involves the objective analysis of objective conditions, said Lenin. If real Maoists do someday adopt the tactic, we can only hope that it will be done only after very careful consideration of the many dangers and pitfalls involved.","created_utc":1540660551,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"thesillandria","body":"I do appreciate your response. And I think our main disagreement concerning global patriarchy is that I myself tend to refrain from using \"patriarchy\" in a singular manner, since it can erase the unique and varied struggles of third world women and even first world women of color by seeming to suggest a univocal form of oppression. You are correct that intersectionality entails that, say, third world women face oppression that is compounded by both imperialism and patriarchy. However we differ in that I would describe their position as being subjects of both imperialism and the gendered oppression it entails *and* at one in the same time subjects of the unique patriarchal culture in which they live. This form of duo-gender-oppression--one from imperialist impositions and the other from their own culture--is very prevalent in imperialized and other subaltern subjects, and is important to understanding the power of imperialism to erode cultural identities.\n\nAnd concerning my assertion of patriarchy as being ideological: I say this since the exploitation of female reproductive labor is, in and of itself, inherent in capitalism (and other economic systems, obviously) and is, therefore, merely its extension. Patriarchy is merely the ideological justification for this oppression. This is primarily why I dislike Marxist Feminism as a whole, because there is this too strong tendency to ignore the productive systems in which patriarchy arises and focusing, instead, on trying to treat patriarchy in the same way Marxists treat capitalism.\n\nAnd I say this because Gender is discursive. Discourse itself affects everything, it is how we speak, how we present ourselves, how we view ourselves and how we identify and definitely affects our relations with others. The state of \"being\" a man or \"being\" a woman is merely the effect of a discourse whose existence attempts to justify the reproductive relations that allow that form of production itself to persist. There is a material basis for gender, certainly. But this basis is always one part of a larger picture, and one that cannot be focused on alone.","created_utc":1540661623,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"DoctorWasdarb","body":"I understand your concern with the language of global patriarchy. However, I view it as similar to speaking of global capitalism. The differences between the oppression faced by white first world workers and third world workers and workers of color is not erased by recognizing capitalism is a global system. Similarly, the differences between the oppression of women is only erased if we fail to address said differences.\n\nI think graver problems arise when we talk about patriarchy in the plural. Such discourse tends towards a white, first world feminism in its cultural essentialism. FW feminists say that the Middle East oppressed women worse than in the US. While it's true, we need to go a step further and ask why. Imperialism causes underdevelopment\/lumpendevelopment in the third world, which entails stunted growth, preventing the third world from developing beyond semi-feudalism. It's this semi-feudal aspect which creates the conditions we're discussing. So yes, Saudi culture is more patriarchal than ours, but Saudi culture does not exist in a vacuum, and its backwardness is tightly linked to imperialism. To speak of multiple patriarchies would ignore the interconnectedness of culture in the age of capitalism-imperialism.\n\nYou're correct that patriarchy is inherent in capitalism, but it has also existed independent of capitalism. Not only has it been present in tributary\/feudal modes of production, but it has existed prior to the establishment of private property and class society. Referring back to Engels book on the subject (and it's on my list to reread), patriarchy developed as a precondition for the establishment of class society. And importantly, it has continued to exist quite poignantly in socialist society as well. It's not full communism, so class isn't fully abolished, but just look at the feminism of the cultural revolution. It engaged in an erasure of femininity. It called femininity bourgeois and women who brought attention to exploitation in the home were ignored or denounced. Reminds me a lot of anti-idpolers... I do think we should be analyzing patriarchy like analyze other modes of production, only its a mode of reproduction, if you will. Its relationship to the mode of production is important, but we can't reduce it only to this.\n\nI can accept what you said about gender, as long as we're careful not to reduce it to either discourse or performance. Like many things, it has material and ideological content.","created_utc":1540669971,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

The reason I won't categorically call Soviet socialism successful is because it was unable to sustain itself.\n\nI do think recognizing the class difference of the opposition would have made a difference in policy. Compare the Purges to the Chinese cultural revolution. The USSR only purged those opposed to Soviet power, whereas in China they purged people with bourgeois ideas, period. I don't think either were correct, because both countries needed reform. (China reformed, and its thriving, whereas the USSR collapsed. The fact that China is still around in this manner proves the correctness of reform.) they needed to slow down and take things step by step. Chiba did. The USSR did not.\n\nI largely agree with you on Stalin and Khrushchev, with the caveat that the stagnation of Soviet political life didn't begin in 1953, but had started while Stalin was still in charge. Khrushchev certainly wasn't \"good,\" but his problem was that he continued the bad parts of Stalin.

From the Invent The Future article I linked below:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;China\u2019s land was never privatised, although collectivisation was  mainly rolled back. It remains owned and managed at the village level.  Peter Nolan observes: *\u201cPublic ownership of land was a powerful  countervailing force to the social inequality which inevitably  accompanied elements of the market reform.\u201d* De-collectivisation *\u201cwas  not followed by the establishment of private property rights. Because  the Chinese Communist Party wished to prevent the emergence of a  landlord class, it did not permit the purchase and sale of farmland\u2026 The  village community remained the owner, controlling the terms on which  land was contracted out and operated by peasant households. It  endeavoured to ensure that farm households had equal access to farmland\u2026  The massively dominant form was distribution of land contracts on a  locally equal per capita basis.\u201d*[32](http:\/\/www.invent-the-future.org\/2018\/05\/why-doesnt-the-soviet-union-exist-any-more-part-8-will-the-peoples-republic-of-china-go-the-way-of-the-ussr\/#fn:32)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Even the town and village enterprises (TVEs), which became the  standard-bearers of economic reform in the 1980s and which came to  employ as many as 135 million people in the mid-1990s, were collectives.  Nolan considers that they *\u201cresembled national state-owned  enterprises, with the \u2018state\u2019 being the local community, each of which  typically owned multiple establishments.\u201d*[33](http:\/\/www.invent-the-future.org\/2018\/05\/why-doesnt-the-soviet-union-exist-any-more-part-8-will-the-peoples-republic-of-china-go-the-way-of-the-ussr\/#fn:33)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;[deepening capitalist relations](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-bmw-jointventure-brilliance-china\/bmw-to-buy-control-of-china-venture-in-new-era-for-foreign-carmakers-idUSKCN1MK2Z9).\n\nThat source describes a foreign company (BMW in this case) opening up a joint venture in China with a greater ownership share than it had had previously.

I learned of the truth by doing research and digging into these not so cheery rumors or \"conspiracy theories\" I'd hear about, through that I found reliable sources of news and a way to weed out the fake news. It takes a few years of doing research to firgure it all out. Express start: infowars and anything else rightwing = no good, lies, or they're just plain wrong on everything. MSM = do the rich's bidding and only report those who cross them or those who won't grease their palms. The best place to find good reliable leads that you can then verify and dig deeper into is alternative leftwing sources such as Democracy Now!, Redacted Tonight, and the work of Dr. Richard Wolff (prof of economics) who hosts a podcast and a youtube show called Democracy At Work. When it comes to vetting the sources you read\/listen to I advise you to use sources that crossrefference the source with it's owner and show you the flow of money. Money is the language of the corrupt, of the lazy bourgoisis.

Ultimately, it is more nit picking semantics on my part to be honest since we both are in agreement that gendered based oppression is global in so far as imperialism has had its effect.\n\nHowever, to clarify a tiny bit about patriarchy vis-a-vis capitalism: I do accept that patriarchy has existed prior to or otherwise outside a capitalistic context. Both pre-capitalist societies and socialist societies have partook in it. My focus on patriarchy is less its connection to capitalism per se, rather to the modes of production that necessitate it. In other words, whenever patriarchy exists, there must be a form of production that necessitates it, or, more specifically, one that requires the exploitation of reproductive labor (here being used in a gender neutral way since, theoretically at least, cis men could be oppressed this way, kinda like a queen bee matriarchy thing ... it has just never happened historically at this point in time). For example, a socialist society that still has patriarchy must therefore have material conditions that still require reproductive exploitation. Whether this makes it \"true\" socialism is irrelevant to me since exploitation is exploitation, regardless of its situation.\n\nThough this, again, is more semantics on my part. I just prefer to analyze these things differently due to my philosophical background in post-structuralism and so on. And your point about it being a mode of reproduction is very salient. The post-structuralist in me loves the idea that production cannot happen without (re)production, and that production must both rely upon reproduction whilst, at one the same time, denying it, erasing it from legitimacy, say in how domestic labor goes unpaid within capitalism, as an example.\n\nMayhaps I myself am partaking in this with my odd semantics?

{"author":"DoctorWasdarb","body":"I do enjoy myself some semantic debates, but you're right, we agree on the core of the issue here.\n\n&gt;In other words, whenever patriarchy exists, there must be a form of production that necessitates it, or, more specifically, one that requires the exploitation of reproductive labor\n\nIf that is the case, how is it that the exploitation of reproductive labor developed prior to the exploitation of productive labor? My point is that the exploitation of reproductive labor can exist, to some extent, independently of the mode of production, since it developed within primitive communism prior to the transition into any tributary or otherwise classed mode of production.\n\n&gt;theoretically at least, cis men could be oppressed this way, kinda like a queen bee matriarchy thing ... it has just never happened historically at this point in time\n\nIt's in parentheses, so I know it's unimportant, but I think it's incorrect to erase womanhood from the exploitation of reproductive labor. Matriarchy can exist theoretically, but we're materialists. We're not about the abstract, we're about what exists before us in reality. Maybe I'm nitpicking, so I apologize for that.\n\n&gt;a socialist society that still has patriarchy must therefore have material conditions that still require reproductive exploitation\n\nThis has dangerous conclusions though. If a socialist society has patriarchy, that means the material conditions for the abolition of patriarchy have not yet been met? So what's the point of feminism? If the same logic were applied to capitalism, it would be clear that it is incoherent. The fact that class exploitation continues to exist means that the conditions for the abolition of class are not met? We know that to be false. Capitalist modernity has created the conditions for the abolition of class, and so we in the labor movement and on the left in general must struggle towards that goal. Similarly, I posit, capitalism has created the conditions for the abolition of patriarchy, and like class, we have an obligation to struggle against it. (Now when we get into third world lumpendevelopment, it gets a bit more complex, because while they have capitalism, they don't have modernity in the sense that we use the term in Western milieus, which is why I advocate anti-imperialist action first, labor and feminist struggle second, and I'm sure I'll get called a revisionist.)\n\n&gt;Though this, again, is more semantics on my part.\n\nWhile the bit about global patriarchy vs localized patriarchies was semantic, I don't think this is. I feel I've identified real disagreements in our analysis that are worthy of fleshing out and discussing, per the rest of my response here.\n\n&gt;production cannot happen without (re)production, and that production must both rely upon reproduction whilst, at one the same time, denying it, erasing it from legitimacy, say in how domestic labor goes unpaid within capitalism, as an example.\n\nProduction cannot happen without reproduction, but I do want to, again, raise a bit of nuance. Just because productive relations are non-exploitative does not mean the reproductive relations will therefore be non-exploitative, (historical socialism) and vice versa. Just because reproductive relations are exploitative does not mean that productive relations must be as well (late primitive communism).","created_utc":1540752141,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"MJoker_","body":"&gt;In \"Reform or Revolution\", by Rosa Luxembourg: \"Between social reforms and the revolution, there is an indissoluble link for social democracy, the struggle for reform being for it the means, but the social revolution the goal.\" \n\nLiterally searched in the entire book for it, and didn't find it. The only place I found this quote was in brainyquotes without a source. So, either you are being an opportunist again and taking this out of your ass, or you haven't read the book. In any case, here's an actual quote from the book for you:\n\n&gt;That is why people who pronounce themselves in favour of the method of legislative reform in place and in contradistinction to the conquest of political power and social revolution, do not really choose a more tranquil, calmer and slower road to the same goal, but a different goal. Instead of taking a stand for the establishment of a new society they take a stand for surface modifications of the old society. If we follow the political conceptions of revisionism, we arrive at the same conclusion that is reached when we follow the economic theories of revisionism. Our program becomes not the realisation of socialism, but the reform of capitalism; not the suppression of the wage labour system but the diminution of exploitation, that is, the suppression of the abuses of capitalism instead of suppression of capitalism itself.\n\n&gt;Does the reciprocal role of legislative reform and revolution apply only to the class struggle of the past? **It is possible that now, as a result of the development of the bourgeois juridical system, the function of moving society from one historic phase to another belongs to legislative reform and that the conquest of State power by the proletariat has really become \u201can empty phrase,\u201d as Bernstein puts it?**\n\n&gt;**The very opposite is true.** What distinguishes bourgeois society from other class societies \u2013 from ancient society and from the social order of the Middle Ages? Precisely the fact that class domination does not rest on \u201cacquired rights\u201d but on real economic relations \u2013 the fact that wage labour is not a juridical relation, but purely an economic relation. In our juridical system there is not a single legal formula for the class domination of today. The few remaining traces of such formulae of class domination are (as that concerning servants), survivals of feudal society.\n\nEmphasis mine. \n\nSo, again, you're full of shit and being an opportunist.\n\n&gt; As for Che Guevara, he explained he didn't believe revolutions would work in countries with strong institutions. He did believe revolution was the only way in countries with weak institutions, but that strong and lasting institutions would always be stronger than the revolution, and that therefore communists would need to take power through institutions in order to revolutionize a country with its main defense: institutions\n\nHe never believed that, holy shit.

People are angry at the political party that had been in power because they have proven themselves to be nothing more than thieves, so people want another party to see if there can be some change. It helps that Bolsonaro is also offering short term solutions for crime in general, because Brazil has a massive violence problem because of those thugs that often get protected by the law for being minors.

There's more to it as well, the Germans allowed Lenin to pass through Germany. \n\nThere's also Hoxha who heavily criticized the USSR post Stalin during the same period the US was criticizing the USSR.

We can talk with all our fancy jargon about contradictions, principle aspects of contradictions, fundamental contradictions, negations of the negation, and we'll understand each other. But we can't talk that way when we're talking to normal people. And you can say that in a socialist society they should teach this stuff in school. Well I studied physics in high school, but I don't understand jack squat if you talk to me in physics jargon. Basically what I'm saying is that it's okay for art not to be particularly dialectical or materialist, because it's meant to target the masses. It's more important that the content of the art isn't reactionary.\n\nAn argument can be made that humans are metaphysical beings, so even if we talk in diamat amongst ourselves, if we actually want to engage with the masses, it's okay for us to use metaphysics in our discourse and propaganda.\n\nI do think fantasy can be a problem if its purpose is about escapism, but I don't want to be dogmatic about that point.

{"author":"NO_Quit","body":"I have been reading about collapse and following it for a year now and I have reached the conclusion that there is nothing to do about it. Literally nothing. We have set in motion positive feedback loops that if we somehow stop all CO2 emissions (that would be the greatst achievement of humanity ever, but nigh impossible) , the loops will raise temperature. Hell, the CO2 PPMs now are enough to raise temperature by 2 or 3 degrees Celsius.\n\nhttps:\/\/qz.com\/1115616\/carbon-dioxide-concentrations-set-a-new-record-2016\/\n\n One of the loops I'm talking about is the Alaskan permafrost. Look at the drunken forests. A 1000 billion tons exists in the top 3 metres of all permafrost. Capitalists have emitted 350 billions since the industrial revolution. \n\nhttps:\/\/news.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/yw98w5\/drunken-forests-in-alaska-are-just-another-sign-of-melting-permafrost?utm_source=reddit.com\n\nHave governments done anything to slow down? No, we just passed the new record of using 100 million barrels of oil per day.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ecowatch.com\/global-oil-demand-supply-iea-2611877467.html\n\nFossil fuels provided 85% of our energy demands in the 1950s. Now? They still provide 85%.\n\nhttp:\/\/nymag.com\/intelligencer\/2017\/07\/man-who-coined-global-warming-on-worst-case-scenarios.html\n\nWhat's worse than all of that is how we communists (or at least every socialist state in history afaik) haven't figured how to coexist with nature. Cuba is no.1 for most sustainable development (it's not perfect though but it's the best model we have so far)\n\nhttps:\/\/www.telesurtv.net\/english\/news\/As-World-Burns-Cuba-Number-1-For-Sustainable-Development-WWF-20161027-0018.html\n\nBut Cuba has never been that polluting anyway. The big socialist countries, the USSR and China haven't been (and in the case of China, it still isn't) ecologically sustainable.\n\nBut I think it's far too late to think of being ecologically sustainable again n hope of stopping climate change and start thinking about how to reduce the harm the inevitable collapse will bring. It doesn't have to be too bad. When one door closes, another door must open.\n\n\nI suggest trying to accept that collapse is inevitable because that's our future. Give this paper a look, it gave me some reassurance that collpase may not be entirely bad.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.lifeworth.com\/deepadaptation.pdf\n\nSorry if this was the answer you didn't want and if the info increased your fear, but truth must be faced sooner better than later. You could start taking action by trying to organize and advocate for degrowth and a truly sustainable society that can have a chance of surviving climate change. Check Monthly Review webstore about ecology books and read their articles about ecology.\n\nClimate catastrophe doesn't mean the end of our struggle, you could even consider it an assistance in taking down Capitalism. Who knows, maybe from the ruins of the old world, the world socialist republic will rise.","created_utc":1540784655,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

It is a **pro-worker, anti-racist** organization that focuses on working class liberation from the oppressive systems which dominate our lives. In states where it is legal to practice armed community defense, many branches choose to become John Brown Gun Clubs, training ourselves and our communities in defense and mutual aid. \n\nThis project was founded in June 2016, by several members of previous similar community defense formations in Kansas and Colorado. We have dozens of [vetted branches](https:\/\/www.redneckrevolt.org\/contact), united under our common goals as outlined in our [principles](https:\/\/www.redneckrevolt.org\/principles), and organized through a collaboratively built national network.\n\nOur national network members come from a variety of ideological backgrounds - libertarians, humanists, anarchists, republicans, communists, and independents. In this project, political ideology is less important to  us than our ability to agree on our [organizing principles](https:\/\/www.redneckrevolt.org\/principles) and work together. Many people nationwide have become politicized for  the first time over the last several years, and are now seeking ways to get involved and protect vulnerable members of their community and keep them safe, while also finding direct ways to dismantle the systemic forms of race and class oppression which have kept us subjugated. We are ready to learn and work with anyone who recognizes the urgency of building community defense networks to protect each other and strengthen our capacity to resist.\n\n[Facebook](http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/redneckrevolt), [Twitter](http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/redneckrevolt), [Contact page](https:\/\/www.redneckrevolt.org\/contact) \n\n# How can I join?\n\n- Visit our [Contact page](https:\/\/www.redneckrevolt.org\/contact) to see if we have a branch in your city.

The country suffered from the stagnation that began in the Western economy around 1975. Yugoslavia was also hard hit by the oil crises in the 1970s and the acute economic downturn in the West at the start of the 1980s. \u201cBy the early 1980s the country faced serious balance of payments problems and rising inflation\u201d (Sean Gervasi, Germany, the U.S. and the Yugoslav Crisis, in Covert Action Winter 1992-3 No. 43, available at http:\/\/www.islandnet.com\/plethora\/yu\/covact-1.html\nGervasi, 1936-1996, was an economic advisor to president Kennedy, and taught economics at Oxford, the LSE, the University of Paris and the University of Belgrade.)The IMF quickly came to the rescue with loans and the standard prescriptions for financial health, which included cutting social outlays, reducing growth, restricting credit, devaluing the currency and other so-called market-oriented reforms such as selling or discontinuing companies that were not privately owned. As usual this contributed to a decline in the standard of living of the working class, as well as to an increasing burden of debt which gave the IMF even more leverage, as it is supposed to do.\nThe economic crisis threatened political stability.

Therefore, you could say it was the place where the Revolution was made more at ease with the working classes themselves.\n\nSecond, there was quite more freedom of speech than in other socialist countries of the time, yet the policies of the party were not harshly criticized, which leads to think people in general agreed with the praxis of the party.\n\nFinally, it got to harmonize the different ethnic, religious and national tensions that had existed in the region for long and created a sense of union of the working classes, regardless of origin, that lasted basically until its dissolution, which is truly one of communism main goals.\n\nUnfortunately, one thing you can surely criticize is the fact that Tito didn't manage to separate its own person from the country's functionality, which was the factor that ultimately led to its dissolution after his death.","created_utc":1540926852,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

Now, this point of view is no longer adequate. **Now we must speak of the world proletarian revolution;** for the separate national fronts of capital have become links in a single chain called the world front of imperialism, which must be opposed by a common front of **the revolutionary movement in all countries.**\u201d - Stalin, Foundations of Leninism, III, Theory. \n\n- stalin and the party of the time funded and aided revolutions all around the world: Spain, Korea, China, Eastern Europe, etc.\n\nto claim stalin was less internationalist is just ignorance, with his words as well as actions he showed to be fully in committed to a world revolution. \n\n&gt; I would assume that, given his Jewish background\n\nstalin had a jewish background too, so did lenin. \n\n&gt;and there would be no non-aggression pact between the two.\n\nafter multiple attempts to form an anti-fascist allience with the allies and after multiple times the allies turned them down the USSR had to look after itself. the USSR understood that the capitalists wanted the nazis to destory the USSR, hitler multiple times stated in speeches and in Mien Kampf that the USSR or the \"judo-bloshevik conspiracy\" was his ultimate goal. the USSR then decided to enter a non-aggression pact with the nazis (not the same thing as an alliance) in order to buy time and force the capitalist powers to side against hitler. \n\nclaiming that the pact was pro-nazi or that the USSR was pro-nazi is ignoring history and what really happened. \n\n\n________\n\nfirst thing to realize is that stalin had no supreme control, he couldn't blink his eyes and then a million people would be dead. now if we are assuming trotsky would be put in the same position as stalin then trotsky equally would not have supreme control to do what ever he wanted. \n\nalso the party of the time (post-civil war) had started to lean away from trotsky due to a number of errors of his, if we assume the same party would be in place then they would have prevented trotsky from doing too much differently. trotsky's line was defeated 700,000 votes to 6,000 votes, the party was clearly against trotsky's over all political line. \n\nnow if we assume trotsky was general sec. and the party was trotskyist then that makes things different. trotsky opposed the peace treaty with germany, so WWI would have still continued in this time line. the masses at the time were strongly opposed to this, the main reason they supported the bolsheviks was because they said they would end the war, and they did. you could probably see this alternate bolshevik party loosing a lot of support and eventually a new party that embodied the mass's needs would take over. \n\nok lets say trotsky did end the war, or was forced too, but the civil war would have still continued. trotsky would have still organized the red army and still would have been commissar of war. by the end of the war the USSR was beat to the ground and needed to rebuild, but trotsky still wanted to march into germany. this again would have lost this alternate bolshevik party a lot of mass support, but lets say they did march into germany. the imperialist powers, particularly japan would have used the mass movement of soviet troops towards the west to put more pressure on the eastern front. the imperialist powers in eastern europe could then cut off a mass of soviet troops on their way to germany, this paired with the japanese push on the eastern front the USSR would have fallen. \n\npretty much the situation was no matter how you turned it the soviets could have never marched to germany without the USSR being counter invaded and falling apart. \n\ntrotsky after the war would have maintained war communism, war communism was very unpopular with the masses, they would have revolted. \n\nEDIT: also, comrade u\/TheEdgyLefty brought up a good point i forgot about. a lot of the industrial and agricultural development would have been stunted if trotsky was in power, and if the masses didn't revolt by then then the nazis would have exploited this weakness to steam roll the USSR in WWII. \n\nafter the war, assuming that china would be ML and that the USSR somehow survived, then china would have been a pretty good front against the trotskyist USSR and those two powers would have probably started fighting. \n\nthis infighting would have left both countries open for the imperialists to attack, particularly the US with their \"new toy\" (the bomb), they could have invaded and nuked both countries. worker movements around the world would  have collapsed and marxist movements in general would have been repressed for a contrary afterwards. \n_______\n\nso pretty much, three times over, the USSR would have fallen apart either by foreign intervention or by the people revolting against the alternate bolshevik party. \n\n\n\n\n","created_utc":1540945484,"score":34,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"KobaSteel","body":"I'd definitely say it was a misconception to say that Trotsky was less authoritarian. I mean he authorised blocking troops to shoot deserters, he wanted to organise the entire economy on military discipline. It's actually a misconception that it was automatically a Stalin v. Trotsky contest to succeed Lenin. Trotsky wasn't really popular with the other Bolsheviks, he was also a pretty terrible politician. It was Zinoviev who was sort of \"most natural\" successor to Lenin; he had been Lenin's lieutenant since 1908, head of Comintern and the Leningrad party organisation. Stalin was a long-loyal Bolshevik, had organised underground worker movements since 1901, but he was a less prominent figure than Zinoviev and Kamenev. Trotsky didn't join the Bolsheviks until summer of 1917, which made him an outsider compared to all the other members of the Central committee. Him and Lenin had some epic battles in papers throughout the period of 1903-1917, here is a particularly vicious one from Lenin called \"Judas Trotsky's Blush of Shame\". It's pretty short so I'll post the whole thing, but it needs a little background. It was in 1911, and Lenin was battling two separate factions, the \"Otvosists,\" who were ultra-leftists that did not want to participate in parliamentary government, and the \"Liquidators\", who wanted to liquidate the underground aspect of the party. Lenin had basically decided that these elements were unfit to be in the type of party he wanted (one based on democratic centralism). Trotsky on the other hand was trying to unify these elements with the party, here's what Lenin wrote;\n\n\"At the Plenary Meeting Judas Trotsky made a big show of fighting liquidationism and otzovism. He vowed and swore that he was true to the Party. He was given a subsidy.\n\nAfter the Meeting the Central Committee grow weaker, the Vperyod group grew stronger and acquired funds. The liquidators strengthened their position and in Nasha Zarya[1] spat in the face of the illegal Party, before Stolypin\u2019s very eyes.\n\nJudas expelled the representative of the Central Committee from, Pravda and began to write liquidationist articles in Vorw\u00e4rts.[2] In defiance of the direct decision of the School Commission[3] appointed by the Plenary Meeting to the effect that no Party lecturer may go to the Vperyod factional school, Judas Trotsky did go and discussed a plan for a conference with the Vperyod group. This plan has now been published by the Vperyod group in a leaflet.\n\nAnd it is this Judas who beats his breast and loudly professes his loyalty to the Party, claiming that he did not grovel before the Vperyod group and the liquidators.\n\nSuch is Judas Trotsky\u2019s blush of shame.\" \n\nIt's also important to say that Trotsky was very much against \"Leninism\" at this time. In fact, he wrote about Lenin in a way very similar to how he would later write about Stalin. He called Lenin \"bureaucratic\" and even accused him of \"terrorizing the Party.\" Just look up \"Our Political Tasks\" on Marxist Internet Archive. \n\nAs far as the foreign policy stuff goes, the pact with Germany is always misunderstood. Stalin had tried for years to get a mutual defense pact between the USSR, Britain and France, but they refused. Stalin wanted guarantees on troop commitment that Britain and France wouldn't give. The wisdom of Stalin playing hard-ball was revealed when Germany invaded Poland and despite declaring war on the Nazis, Great Britain and France wouldn't fire a single shot at them and would actually mobilize against the Soviets. The USSR had a mutual defense treaty with Czechoslovakia; and the British and the French met with Germany (without the USSR) to negotiate the Nazi takeover of the country. The British and French did everything they could to push Hitler east. Germany would have invaded Poland regardless, but the pact saved the eastern part from German occupation (at least at first) and allowed the Soviets to move their front a couple hundred kilometers to the west. Stalin knew that war with Germany was unavoidable, the pact was simply about delaying the invasion. It's difficult to know what Trotsky would have actually done because during this time he was basically just criticizing everything the Stalin did. He blamed him for Hitler's rise to power for not working with the german social democrats who literally murdered leftists. Then he criticised his decision to seek alliances with Britain and France. \n\n\nIf you're interested in reading more on this topic, I wrote a long essay on this for my personal use, as I've been researching this topic after being assigned a super-inaccurate piece by a local Trotskyist group I was looking at joining. It deals mostly with Lenin and Trotsky's many disagreements, and the power struggle after Lenin dies. Here's a link to my essay: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1tBaSLpdFmAMRB3GItyvMvKz9V4n3VnkvVrOFBvwAO9g\/edit?usp=sharing, you can probably find the article I'm responding to by googling it, but I wouldn't recommend it, it's simply historically inaccurate. \n\n","created_utc":1540956586,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"DoctorWasdarb","body":"You're clearly better read than I am. I don't have the motivation to read that much about Soviet history. I'm much more interested in China personally, but also the Global South more generally.\n\nThere are a couple things I'd like to expound upon. First, Stalin wasn't necessarily a pacifist on Korean unification, but he wasn't exactly for it either. He had told Kim that he would support the war if China did most of the heavy lifting. China agreed, so Stalin gave the green light. However, Stalin refused to use the veto at the security council to stop the UN intervention on behalf of the south. It was supposed to be a principled refusal to participate as long as the PRC was denied membership, but it was at best, foolish. He did provide some arms support, though.\n\nI don't know the details of Soviet policy towards Israel, but I know he provided arms support to their war of nationhood, if we can call it that. Perhaps it changed. You would know better than I. I don't know how much aid the Soviets gave to Arab resistance.\n\nI've offered a different view of the USSR, similar to that of China. I wouldn't categorically call either anti-imperialist in the sense that they funded anti-imperialist struggles around the globe, because they didn't. But they were\/China is opposing imperialism in its own borders, and were\/is friends with anti-imperialist states where they exist. I think it's problematic that the USSR would sell arms to India or support resolutions of UN intervention in Africa, just as I think it's wrong for China to arm the Philippines, the mujahideen back in the 80s, or for them to pass sanctions on the DPRK. But I don't think these elements represent the rule. They are discrepancies. Anxious to hear your thoughts.\n\nThat's a fair point about Stalin fetishization. While it is more of a Hoxhaist problem, I've experienced it from MLs, and it's left a sour taste in my mouth. But even mainstream MLs, at least the ones I know, still uphold the \"Khrushchev committed a coup and that's why the USSR stopped being socialist and democratic and good\" theory. I've seen others of the Stalin fetish suggest that he was dwindling in influence in the party in the last few years of his life, in an effort to explain away some of the bad stuff the USSR did.","created_utc":1540957986,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"stalmek","body":"Yeah actually some people are are telling a lot of bullshit. I've been working on the history of the PCF (French communist party) for a while now, and I'll try to give you a brief history of this Party.\n\nThe PCF was created in 1920 after it scissioned from the SFIO (the socialist party to be), in order to follow the Komintern. The majority of the scissionists were workers.\n\nFrom 1920 to 1934, the PCF was a real revolutionary party, with clandestine armed cells, linked to the legal organization. They developed the \"class against class\" strategy, got rid of the petit-bourgeois and revisionists in the party. They were the first to criticize the colonial policies lead by the French left (radical and socialists included).\n\nAfter 1934 and the failed fascist coup, the PCF allied with the socialists and the radicals, in order to form the Front Populaire (popular front) : a government of unity based on anti-fascism. They were not in the government but yet they supported it. 1936 was a big year for the advancing of social rights in France (with the creation of the payed holiday). \nThese years were really important in the history of the PCF ideology, as it started to develop patriotic ideas, and finding legitimacy in the French history (French revolutions, Paris Commune etc)\n\nIn 1938, with the german-Soviet pact, the PCF who followed Moscow's orders was forbidden in France. Yet it continued to operate. When France was invaded and the USSR was attacked, this party who was already clandestine with armed cells, joined the resistance. An estimated number of 75,000 members of the PCF were executed by the French militia and the nazis between 1941-1944, a lot were deported to concentration camps.\n\nAfter WWII, the PCF was one of the biggest political forces in France, with almost 30% of the votes. Between 1944-1962, the PCF was really powerful, and thanks to this, France got public social security, women's right to vote etc.\nAll the proletarian suburbs surrounding Paris were communists, and it was called \"Banlieue rouge\" (red suburbs).\n\nThe Algerian crisis was complicated for the PCF, but they supported the anti-colonial struggles. \n\nAfter the 1950's, the PCF started to decline as a proletarian revolutionary party. A lot of intellectuals got into strategic positions in the party, and they started becoming real reformists. \nMay 1968 was really bad for the PCF, as they did not follow the workers and students on strike, and had real revisionist ideas. The \"radical left\" : trotskyists, maoists, left com etc kind of stole the revolutionary forces from the PCF.\n\nFrom 1968 to nowadays, the PCF is not even a socialist party. It's mostly made of old people who do not act much.","created_utc":1540976839,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

If you leave out the social aspect of it then you cant really say how long it takes to turn, eg, thread into cloth. It depends on the methods being used, the tools, the skill of the labourer, etc. Etc.\n\nHowever because of the way capitalism works it is always in the capitalists interest to produce more faster, so they invest in tools. When the loom came to be we were able to make cloth way faster than by hand, so if we erroneously believe that value is determined by the amount of *individual* labour gone into it then it seems like the hand made cloth would be much more valuable because it took much more labour. But of course the products are essentially the same so you cant take the hand made cloth to market and expect to sell at a higher price.\n\nActually what happens is the exact opposite. Yesterday I brought 100 pieces of hand made cloth to market, and you did the same. We each sold most of our stock at a high price. Today I have my minions working on looms so I produced 200 pieces of the same cloth and go to market. But if I have the same cloth and sell it at the same price why would the loom change anything at all? I should expect to sell the same as yesterday, then being left with a bunch of excess product. What if instead I sold them at a reduced price? Why would anybody buy the same product from you for more? They wouldn't, so now I can clear all 200 of my products, making more total income. And you cannot possibly compete without matching my price! As long as I've got stock to sell nobody will ever pay more than my price for comparable cloth.

A hard to shake indoctrination from school, television, and the \"prevailing wisdom\" that Stalin was an evil despot who robbed from the people to enrich himself, murdered randomly and without reason or restraint, and attempted to genocide the USFR Ukrainians for no particular reason, and then around a decade later he joins the Allies during WW2 and defeats Nazi Germany, before dying shortly after.\n\nNow some of that might be true, but I later learned most of it was overblown, ahistorical, or \\*at least\\* devoid of any context.

Particularly with Marxism (Communism), because it's an actual science, not an ideology or opinion.\n\nGood luck to both of us on our path to further our class consciousness :)","created_utc":1541012223,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

This led to the fracturing of the working and class collaboration based off the lines of nationalism, which eventually lead to civil war. Along with the introduction of neo liberalism into society, Slovenia became fully capitalist along with the other republics.\n\nSo if there were to be a workers revolution, class collaboration would need to be destroyed along with nationalism in all the republics, since it's objectively true that Yugoslavia's success came from unifying the working class from all 6 republics. Combine that with the fact that Slovenia cannot be self sufficient (since it is small and would lose trade with the west bc it's now socialist) So the revolution must spread throughout the entire region if it has a chance of success. Yugoslavia has done it before, so it is more than capable of doing it again.\n","created_utc":1541012929,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

And of course the meat industry has created with marketing-\"social-engineering\" a meat-eater-counter-identity where the cultural hierarchy is reversed, which ultimately makes this a futile strategy.\n\nIt's not going to change unless production changes, even in India where eating cows violates strong cultural and religious prohibitions, people still increased consumption of cow-meat as soon as burger-chains got popular. You are not going to fix issues in capitalism by controlling the individual.","created_utc":1541021916,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"hliosporos","body":"I don't doubt that, and it sounds much like my own life.  \nThat makes us comrades!\n\nI wasn't being holier-than-thou; my point is that calling yourself a specific -ist can have connotations you might be unaware of at this point, if you need to ask someone if you're a communist or an anarchist (many, if not most of which are communists). There's a chance you'll be confronted (likely by someone far less informed) for your -ism, and it can get frustrating if you aren't prepared to respond. Other than that you can't find enough conviction in a specific -ism when you're not familiar with it. You should get in touch with your local -ists of any -ism you're interested in, and definitely look up their actions and relations with other -ists of the same kind. They'll be glad to introduce you to their core concepts, which should be fairly quick.\n\nWhile writing this I still haven't \"picked\" an -ism myself, though I'm strongly leaning towards Leninism. Most of the time, I think the hugely broad term \"socialist\" (ninja edit, anarchism is included, as a form of libertarian socialism) works just fine for me. If it gets more specific, I can add revolutionary or radical, which should be obvious anyway. Cheers!","created_utc":1541022177,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}
