{"author":"ShittyInternetAdvice","body":"I would cite this passage from Engels from Socialism: Utopian and Scientific. State capitalism does not necessarily mean the end of the socialist project. What it does suggest is that we are at an inflection point, and will see how the CPC acts in the coming decades:\n\n*In any case, with trusts or without, the official representative of capitalist society \u2014 the state \u2014 will ultimately have to undertake the direction of production. [4] This necessity for conversion into State property is felt first in the great institutions for intercourse and communication \u2014 the post office, the telegraphs, the railways.*\n\n*If the crises demonstrate the incapacity of the bourgeoisie for managing any longer modern productive forces, the transformation of the great establishments for production and distribution into joint-stock companies, trusts, and State property, show how unnecessary the bourgeoisie are for that purpose. All the social functions of the capitalist has no further social function than that of pocketing dividends, tearing off coupons, and gambling on the Stock Exchange, where the different capitalists despoil one another of their capital. At first, the capitalistic mode of production forces out the workers. Now, it forces out the capitalists, and reduces them, just as it reduced the workers, to the ranks of the surplus-population, although not immediately into those of the industrial reserve army.*\n\n*But, the transformation \u2014 either into joint-stock companies and trusts, or into State-ownership \u2014 does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces. In the joint-stock companies and trusts, this is obvious. And the modern State, again, is only the organization that bourgeois society takes on in order to support the external conditions of the capitalist mode of production against the encroachments as well of the workers as of individual capitalists. The modern state, no matter what its form, is essentially a capitalist machine \u2014 the state of the capitalists, the ideal personification of the total national capital. The more it proceeds to the taking over of productive forces, the more does it actually become the national capitalist, the more citizens does it exploit. The workers remain wage-workers \u2014 proletarians. The capitalist relation is not done away with. It is, rather, brought to a head. But, brought to a head, it topples over. State-ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of the conflict, but concealed within it are the technical conditions that form the elements of that solution.*","created_utc":1533083030,"score":28,"subreddit":"communism"}

The profit motive (while fully acknowledging its inherent exploitative nature) is an effective means at driving innovations and growth in production and cost reduction up to a certain point.\n\nI agree that socialism is ultimately more efficient because it doesn't run into the problem of overproduction, but when you are trying to build up the infrastructure from scratch to fully meet peoples' needs, that's where the capitalist mode of production is best suited to start.

Profit is seen in the interest that people willingly pay to borrow money. \nI would also say that banks take on risk by giving out loans. If someone defaults on a loan, the bank may never see that money. However, they try to balance that risk by charging higher interest if the loan is more risky. Do people pay most of the time? Yeah probably. But banks are not immune to default (see recession in 2008). So I think banks do a good job of putting themselves in a \"win-win\" situation but that's not to say they don't lose here and there (ie defaults on unsecured loans).\nGetting back to the original topic, I don't see where people are forced to work for an upper class in a Capitalist society.

{"author":"DeLaProle","body":"Lenin goes over this well, with help from Marx and Engels, in an essay he wrote called [*Imperialism and the Split in Socialism*](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/lenin\/works\/1916\/oct\/x01.htm):  \n  \n&gt;The proletariat is the child of capitalism\u2014of world capitalism, and not only of European capitalism, or of imperialist capitalism. [...] at the present time, in the imperialist countries of Europe, *you [Kautskyites] are fawning* on the opportunists, who are *alien* to the proletariat as a class, who are the servants, the agents of the bourgeoisie and the vehicles of its influence, and unless the labour movement *rids* itself of them, it will remain a *bourgeois labour movement*. By advocating \u201cunity\u201d with the opportunists, with the Legiens and Davids, the Plekhanovs, the Chkhenkelis and Potresovs, etc., you are, objectively, defending the *enslavement* of the workers by the imperialist bourgeoisie with the aid of its best agents in the labour movement.  \n  \n&gt;These two trends, one might even say *two* parties, in the present-day labour movement, which in 1914\u201316 so obviously parted ways all over the world, were *traced by Engels and Marx in England* throughout the course of decades, roughly from 1858 to 1892.  \n\n&gt;Neither Marx nor Engels lived to see the imperialist epoch of world capitalism, which began not earlier than 1898\u20131900. But it has been a peculiar feature of England   that even in the middle of the nineteenth century she already revealed at least two major distinguishing features of imperialism: (1) vast colonies, and (2) monopoly profit (due to her monopoly position in the world market). In both respects England at that time was an exception among capitalist countries, and Engels and Marx, analysing this exception, quite clearly and definitely indicated its *connection* with the (temporary) victory of opportunism in the English labour movement.   \n  \n&gt;In a letter to Marx, dated October 7, 1858, Engels wrote: \u201c...The English proletariat is actually becoming more and more bourgeois, so that this most bourgeois of all nations is apparently aiming ultimately at the possession of a bourgeois aristocracy and a bourgeois proletariat *alongside* the bourgeoisie. For a nation which exploits the whole world this is of course to a certain extent justifiable.\u201d In a letter to Sorge, dated September 21, 1872, Engels informs him that Hales kicked up a big row in the Federal Council of the International and secured a vote of censure on Marx for saying that \u201cthe English labour leaders had sold themselves\u201d. Marx wrote to Sorge on August 4, 1874: \u201cAs to the urban workers here [in England], it is a pity that the whole pack of leaders did not get into Parliament. This would be the surest way of getting rid of the whole lot.\u201d In a letter to Marx, dated August 11, 1881, Engels speaks about \u201cthose very worst English trade unions which allow themselves to be led by men sold to, or at least paid by, the bourgeoisie.\u201d In a letter to Kautsky, dated September 12, 1882, Engels wrote: \u201cYou ask me what the English workers think about colonial policy. Well, exactly the same as they think about politics in general. There is no workers\u2019 party here, there are only Conservatives and Liberal-Radicals, and the workers gaily share the feast of England\u2019s monopoly of the world market and the colonies.\u201d  \n  \n&gt;On December 7, 1889, Engels wrote to Sorge: \u201cThe most repulsive thing here [in England] is the bourgeois \u2018respectability\u2019, which has grown deep into the bones of the workers.... Even Tom Mann, whom I regard as the best of the lot, is fond of mentioning that he will be lunching with the Lord Mayor. If one compares this with the French, one realises, what a revolution is good for, after all.\u201d In a letter, dated April 19, 1890: \u201cBut *under* the surface the movement [of the working class in England] is going on, is embracing ever wider sections and mostly just among the hitherto stagnant *lowest* [Engels\u2019s italics] strata. The day is no longer far off when this mass *will* suddenly *find itself*, when it will dawn upon it that it itself is this colossal mass in motion.\u201d On March 4, 1891: \u201cThe failure of the collapsed Dockers\u2019 Union; the \u2018old\u2019 conservative trade unions, *rich* and therefore cowardly, remain lone on the field....\u201d September 14, 1891: at the Newcastle Trade Union Congress the old unionists, opponents of the eight-hour day, were defeated \u201cand the bourgeois papers recognise the defeat of the *bourgeois labour party*\u201d (Engels\u2019s italics throughout)....  \n  \n\nThis is why anti-imperialism is so important, beyond the simple fact that imperialism *is* capitalism. When it comes to the issue of the core vs periphery imperialism has this dialectical relationship: the imperialist core grows stronger, the security-state is built ever more fiercely with the super-profits that imperialism enables, also bribing certain strata of the working class (ie labor aristocracy), making revolution in the core doubly difficult; it also makes revolution in the imperialized areas difficult by subjugation from this same profit-rich state force (ie the military) while keeping the population chained to this imperialism, reproducing despondency and national dependence. As Marx\/Engels stated there can be no socialist movement as long as a nation lacks self-determination. \n\n  \n","created_utc":1533270798,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

I'm disappointed in this thread instead devolving into a bunch of dudes showing off how much they know from investopedia to each other. Why is Amazon so overinflated in stock price?

By having underpaid workers so there is a benefit for themselves. So is basically making someone work and pay less than the final product.\n\nIf you are not part of the bourgeoise, you really need to take it from your personal perspective.\n\nExample:\n\n\nOne bourgeise pays 500$ for materials a day to make a car in a factory, and pays 900$ monthly (30$\/day) to his 10 workers.\n\nWhich must be the price of THAT cat to make profit?  More than 800$ to make any profit. Let's say he sell it for 1500$, so it is a 700$ profit, that he did not earn.

Capitalism is structurally imperialist and the horrible material and political conditions of the super-exploited periphery are self-evident.

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"This is all minor political jockeying imo. The real counterevolution happened in 2004-2010.\n\n&gt;When war veterans took over the leadership of the land occupations\nmovement after the truce with President Mugabe, ZANU-PF and the state in 1997, this was no longer about a \u2018single issue\u2019 of their grievances, but a social\ngrievance of a national nature. They then articulated, not only the land and\nagrarian question, but also the urban and industrial question, simultaneously\nattacking the landed settler bourgeoisie and organising urban housing co-\noperatives and informal sector establishments. Completion of this NDR [National Democratic Revolution]\nraised questions far beyond the limits of removing colonial and settler systems\nof production. This revolution questioned elitism and nationalist garb, noting\nthat this was a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, whereupon it became as much a\ntarget as settler and international capital, then breaking the tripartite alliance.\nInternational capital panicked and sought what it thought would be a better\nclass ally than the nationalists and backed the opposition led by the MDC,\nisolating their former nationalist allies.\nBy 2000, the matrix of contradictions had reached its climax and an\nuncontrollable anti-state, anti-elite and anti-capital revolutionary tsunami\nraged. Race and class elitism were under challenge from below. However, the\nrupture of the Lancaster alliance called for a change in the strategy and tactics\nof the revolution as the elitism and nationalism on the one hand drifted from\nsettler and international capital on the other. Nationalists sought an alliance\nwith the revolutionaries to face their class allies of settler and international\ncapital, the later of which had now groomed a formidable opposition MDC.\nThis was a complex reconfiguration of political forces.\nHowever, the alliance of nationalist elites with the revolutionaries was just\na marriage of convenience since the two had antagonistic class interests. So\nwhen nationalists retained political power in the crucial 2005 elections, they\nunilaterally broke their alliance with the revolutionaries and mounted military\nstyle attacks on them, Operations Murambatsvina and Chikorokoza Chapera.\nRevolutionaries further mobilised and by 2008 the nationalist movement\nwas isolated, suffering near defeat and they mounted the retributive violent\nOperation Mavhotera Papi. However, both sides of capital saw how dangerous\nwas the game they were playing and decided to unite in the best interests of\ntheir class. They formed the GNU, an alliance against the working classes and\nmarginalised war veterans.\n\nThis is only half the story, since the reason the military backed nationalist bourgeoisie was able to win was because the A2 and A1 landowners split and a new black bourgeois and petty-bourgeois class constituted itself politically. Mugabe ended up becoming symbolic of the revolution (at least further to the left than the black bourgeoisie if not revolutionary) so he had to go, but the class struggle had already been lost. Once land reform starts to become more capitalistic we will see how much persistence the war veteran organizations and landless peasant class struggle actually has. At minimum, the defeat of the MDC means that settler colonialism is dead once and for all and future class struggles will be on the terrain of socialism.

Nothing in this movie indicates anything surrounding Marxism, if anything there are heavy hints of liberal individualism. \n\nI was actually super disappointed by it, probably because of all the praise it got from various leftists both online and in my community. I really was expecting something more.\n\nLet me expand: \n\nYes, there are themes connected to labor organizing, but as communist propaganda\/consciousness raising (which Boots Riley has said was the goal of the movie), it falls flat. The labor struggle at the company is seemingly kick-started by a single union salt, with very little about the actual collective work that goes with union organizing. There is barely any reference to wage-labor, the fight of the union is to win some job amelioration, but as soon as the strike is finished, they all go back to work as if nothing happened (despite the fact the end of the movie heavily implies an all out, city-wide riot). \n\nNo mention of the bourgeoisie proper, just an evil individual company owner. No real mentions of cops and their abuse and repression of the working class, despite the heavy focus on the racialized proletariat of the movie - it is the company stooges that do the repression (there is literally no cop in this whole movie, pay attention to the uniforms). \n\nThe slave labor of the company is barely referenced. Instead of having a movie which sees the labor struggle in a service industry connect with the slave labourers (the productive proletariat) and engage in a mass, revolutionary strike (considering the slave labour is hinted to have replaced most industrial production), and engage with the capitalist state at their riot, we have a movie with absurd human-horses, who come and save the day after being freed, and then just kind of disappear. Meanwhile,\n\nThe only violence by the workers shown is by these absurd figures at the end coming to get the evil boss. Not the bourgeoisie as a whole, not the bourgeois state, no, just this one evil boss. In that sense, it is very similar to Mr. Robot.\n\nIt rang as a left-of center work plagued with bourgeois ideological notions of individualism, of individual evil, of individual exceptionally good few heroes, of an individual disconnected struggle. Not to mention the problematic quasi non-inclusion of women.\n\nI had fun watching it (albeit the middle part was totally dragged out and frankly boring at times), but saying this is a great marxist movie is just not correct. The movie could have been that, but the author made plot choices which IMO were unnecessary, and eventually diluted the potentially communist potential to appeal to a broader audience. \n","created_utc":1533439680,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

This is \"backed up\" by an anonymous source and \"three firefighters\".\n\n&gt; Sources who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity have claimed that there was no assassination attempt behind the blasts that rocked the Venezuelan capital on Saturday. The commotion was caused by a gas tank explosion, they said.\n\n&gt; A version purporting to explain the loud blasts and resulting chaos during Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro speech has emerged, contradicting the official account of the events. Citing three firefighters who were working to contain the fire at a building near the scene, AP reported that it was a gas tank inside one of the apartments that went off, not explosives-laden drones as stated by the Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself.\n\n[Source](https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/435136-maduro-assassination-versions-gas\/)\n\nEven though a terrorist (sorry I guess I should say \"opposition group\" since it is only terrorist when it happens to the west.) group already claimed responsibility. The footage shows Maduro and the other officials looking up at something before it cuts out. Soldiers coming to shield them, and there are images of a supposed drone crashing into an apartment.

Magically he also thinks this shouldn't apply to him and plays the victim when he falls foul of these laws. \n\nSpecifically he was arrested for contempt of court. This wasn't just some random trial down the local magistrates for a petty theft or something, but a highly sensitive sexual offences trial. These are notoriously difficult to bring to trial, much less gain a conviction, and take thousands of hours from police, legal representatives, court staff, social workers, counsellors and other staff to get the necessary evidence and persuade often terrified victims to testify. You'd think given his windbaggery about protecting girls from exploitation, Robinson would have been perhaps more supportive of such a process which is intended to put sexual predators into prison. Instead he ignores quite clear reporting restrictions for the sake of an agenda, imperilling not just the impartiality of the trial but any chance of gaining a secure conviction. His interference gave any defence barrister a prime opportunity to claim the right to a fair trial had been breached, and therefore the convictions would be overturned.

I'm reading one right now about the commune system, and I barely have to roll my eyes at the random insertions of anti-communism. \n\nThere's no great conspiracy, simply that all the progressive scholars who sympathized with the USSR in the 30s were purged by McCarthyism or are dead while the progressive scholars who sympathized with Cuba and China are still alive. New scholars have some measure of institutional protection if they want to study actual socialist history and the new left has not completely exhausted its energy since parts of its ideology is still necessary to liberal hegemony (whereas Marxism-Leninism no longer speaks to progressive liberals like it did during the peak of the CPUSA). Obviously these trends will always be a small minority but the existence of Grover Furr in a lit. department should tell you how desperate Soviet studies is compared to Chinese studies. Anyway this is coming to an end because of the wave of Chinese money and institutional support for research on socialism with very little ideological pressure.

It looks excellent though and it deals with the Russian Civil War. As far as games that specifically go over planned economy - that's all I can think of of the top of my head.\n\nThere are video games (often made by Russian devs) that have decent pro-Socialist politics. I think it's called Men of War: Assault Squad and it's like a 3rd person RTS where you can play as the Soviets in WW2 and the Vietnamese soldiers fighting American invaders in Vietnam. The games are also good politically, I believe. Also I personally think most of the cyberpunk games are highly class-conscious by design. I can specifically recommend the Shadowrun series. I personally played the one set in Hong Kong. If you turn on the developer commentary - there is even a point in the game when the devs say that \"the ruling class is objectively fascist.\" However, the genre itself traditionally caters to anarchist politics, but it is what it is.

{"author":"Rymdkommunist","body":"When Ibrahim, on God\u2019s orders, refrained from sacrificing his son Ishmael and sacrificed a sheep instead, the blood spurted skyward and created the Milky Way. Drops also rained down on the earth and created the water sources, a gift of God.\n\nYou can still hear this tale from Bedouin in Sinai, says an anthropologist who asked to remain anonymous. She hasn\u2019t heard a similar story from Palestinian Bedouin, but they, too, were raised on its ethical and practical implications: Because water sources, like rivers and springs, are a gift from God, one may not privatize, fence off or block access to them. And because they belong to everyone, they must be used fairly: Tents must be pitched a few hundred meters from a river or spring, so as not to pollute them and not to deter others from using them.\n\nBut cisterns for collecting rainwater, which Bedouin communities dig at their two usual, fixed encampment locations, are another story. Because people toiled for them, they are considered private property.\n\n&gt;&gt; Once again, Israel denies the Bedouin what it grants the settlers \u25a0  Israeli minister planned eviction of West Bank Bedouin 40 years ago, document reveals \u25a0 Everything you need to know about the West Bank Bedouin village at the eye of a diplomatic storm &lt;&lt;\n\nIn years of abundance, when the cisterns are full even in the summer, the water can be shared or sold. During droughts, the cistern is for family use only. The Bedouin\u2019s dependence on these cisterns determines where their tents are pitched \u2013 typically, on hillsides where as much water as possible can be collected.\n\nThe winter of 1972 didn\u2019t provide enough rain, as is evident from an official letter sent in May 1972 by Lt. Azriel David, at Israel\u2019s military headquarters in the Ramallah District, to the head of the economics department and a staff officer at the main military headquarters for the West Bank.\n\n\u201c... I realized that there\u2019s a severe shortage of water for Bedouin in the Ramallah District,\u201d David wrote. \u201cThey have cisterns that urgently need filling.\u201d\n\nHe then listed the locations of 12 cisterns belonging to the Kaabneh and Jahalin tribes. The cisterns in question, and the Bedouin tents they served, are still located alongside the Jericho-Jerusalem highway, Hizma and the Taibeh-Jericho road.\n\nIn subsequent years, water was regularly supplied to Bedouin in the southern West Bank, some of it via connections to water mains. For instance, on February 12, 1976, a water-quota officer at the West Bank military headquarters sent the head of the economics department details of the water consumption and costs of Bedouin communities in the Judea region.\n\nThis concern over water shows that the military administration understood that one of its jobs, under international law, was to see to the basic needs of the local population in the occupied territory. Yet at the same time, acting on orders from Alignment-led governments (the Alignment was a precursor of the Labor Party), it emerges that military commanders were toying with plans for permanent places of residence for the Bedouin as far back as the early 1970s.\n\nIn other words, they planned to put an end to the Bedouin herders\u2019 lifestyle, which entailed moving between the two fixed locations (in the highlands in summer and the lowlands in winter), and settling them in a single, permanent location.\n\nIDF Maj. Rani Langer's 1975 letter documenting Minister Yisrael Galilee's request for \u201crecommendations for a permanent settlement\" of Bedouin \"in places that don\u2019t disturb [Jewish] settlement plans.\"\nIDF Maj. Rani Langer's 1975 letter documenting Minister Yisrael Galilee's request for \u201crecommendations for a permanent settlement\" of Bedouin \"in places that don\u2019t disturb [Jewish] settlement plans.\"IDF Archive\nThis is evident from military documents in the Israel Defense Forces Archive, dating from the 1970s and early \u201880s. But until 1981, these documents, which were classified or distributed in a limited fashion, didn\u2019t explain the reasons behind the wish to settle the Bedouin in permanent settlements in the territories occupied in 1967, which were presented to the outside world as being \u201ctemporarily administered\u201d by Israel. An exception is one such document from 1975, connected to Minister Yisrael Galili.\n\nPlanning continuity\n\nThese documents show the continuity in planning, from the 1970s right up to the current plans of Israel\u2019s Civil Administration in the West Bank to forcibly remove the Abu Dahouk clan, which belongs to the Jahalin tribe, from the Khan al-Ahmar region, 16 kilometers east of Jerusalem. These plans call for their forcible transfer to a semi-urban compound near the Abu Dis garbage dump, abutting the city. By the late 1990s, some communities belonging to the Jahalin\u2019s Salamat clan were forcibly settled there, to make room for the expansion of Ma\u2019aleh Adumim settlement.\n\nThough the earlier plans weren\u2019t implemented, Israel\u2019s military and political echelons continually took steps to reduce the Bedouin\u2019s pasturage and their ability to make a living, by preventing access to water sources and declaring vast areas to be military training zones or nature preserves. Thus, since the late 1970s, some 25 Bedouin communities between Jerusalem and Jericho were practically forced to live in fixed, constrained locations, in ever-worsening conditions, because of Israel\u2019s refusal to allow construction of new shacks and pens, and even schools or clinics.\n\nIn November and December 1971, intensive correspondence took place among several officers in the Ramallah District about permanent settlements for the Bedouin. The addressees were the head of the economics department at the West Bank headquarters (whose name isn\u2019t mentioned) and the special tasks officer for the Bedouin, who at that time was Capt. Yigal Hagiladi.\n\nThose involved in the exchange were the staff officers in charge of roads and water, the custodian of abandoned and governmental property, and the Agriculture Ministry\u2019s head of water development.

Moshe Levy, met with the mukhtars of four local Bedouin communities (Abu Dahouk wasn\u2019t one of them) and informed them of the permanent locations that had been chosen for them. A tour was planned for the mukhtars on January 11.\n\nBut six months later, the problems had already surfaced. On July 27, 1972, Lt. Col. Moshe Feldman, commander of the Ramallah District, wrote to the head of the economics department, \u201cA few days ago, I informed your aide that we\u2019ve failed in our efforts to permanently settle the Bedouin in communities on the mountain ridge, in light of what was agreed on this issue, to save the costs of permanent settlement.\u201d\n\nThe custodian of absentee property had problems finding suitable sites (apparently on lands that weren\u2019t privately owned). An earlier document clarifies that the military commanders also objected to some of the proposed sites. And above all, \u201cWhen we checked with the sheikhs, all of them opposed moving from their own locations to this line of settlements for fear of problems with the permanent communities\u201d \u2013 i.e., neighboring Palestinian villages \u2013 \u201cand problems with pasturage.\u201d\n\nSilent documents\n\nThis same fear of conflict with villagers who own the land (and with Salamat, another Jahalin clan), as well as the desire to maintain their herding lifestyle, are also driving the Abu Dahouk\u2019s demand today to be allowed to establish a permanent community in its current location in Khan al-Ahmar.\n\nIn 1971-72, the officers presumably read a nine-page report written by Yigal Hagiladi. He lists the names of the tribes and sub-tribes living in the West Bank by region and describes their history. The Jahalin, he wrote, came from the other side of the Jordan River in the late 17th or early 18th century. He knew they were expelled from the Negev after the establishment of Israel in 1948; the size of their flocks; whether any of their members worked in Jerusalem; which sub-tribes or clans were at odds with each other; and who the mukhtars were.\n\nHagiladi\u2019s report says that most Bedouin communities both farm and herd, and are in advanced stages of progress toward \u201cpermanent settlement.\u201d\n\nOn December 10, 1975, Maj. Rani Langer, chief of staff for the head of IDF Central Command, said that Minister Yisrael Galili had asked for a working paper to be drawn up about \u201cplaces where the Bedouin population is concentrated\u201d in the West Bank, along with \u201crecommendations for a permanent settlement of this population, in addition to ways of creating incentives for this, in places that don\u2019t disturb [Jewish] settlement plans and aren\u2019t expected to undermine them in the future.\u201d The Jewish settlements on the agenda at the time were located in the Jordan Valley and Ma\u2019aleh Adumim, east of Jerusalem.\n\nA Bedouin encampment near the West Bank city of Hebron, in 2010.\nA Bedouin encampment. Israel\u2019s military and political echelons continually took steps to reduce the Bedouin\u2019s pasturage and ability to make a living by preventing access to water sources.Tal Cohen\nFive years passed after the initial plans to permanently settle the Bedouin were brought up in 1971, and they languished (aside from those relating to the Rashida tribe, which was settled south of Bethlehem). Did the officers understand that a rapid and forcible transfer to permanent settlements would contradict the Bedouin way of life? On that, the documents are silent.\n\nOn December 14, 1975, Dr. Moshe Sharon, an expert in Middle Eastern studies, submitted recommendations for permanently settling the Bedouin to the head of the economics department in the West Bank military headquarters, Dr. Efraim Ahiram, based on a paper about the Bedouin that he had written for the army a few months earlier. He said the Jahalin \u2013 whose two main sub-tribes, the Abu Dahouk and the Salamat, \u201croam through the southern Ramallah District and the northern Bethlehem District\u201d \u2013 and are \u201cthe most problematic category.\u201d He did not explain why.\n\nSharon wrote that he was \u201cconvinced that it\u2019s possible to enlist the Bedouin in ongoing security work as lookouts and trackers, especially in the areas where they roam, which are liable to serve as transit areas for people engaged in hostile enemy action.\u201d But despite his functional attitude toward them, Sharon\u2019s proposal still seems, in retrospect, to strive to preserve the Bedouin as a herding community, with space for pasturage and opportunities to improve their flocks and fatten their sheep.\n\nThe documents obtained by Haaretz then jump to 1981, four years after the Alignment government was replaced by Likud. In May, Dr. Sharon submitted a longer and more detailed survey of the Bedouin in the West Bank, which was widely circulated, including among military governors of the various districts and several Shin Bet security service officers. Bedouin can be found in every district of the West Bank, he wrote, but, \u201cthey are an administrative problem\u201d only in three districts: Hebron, Bethlehem and Ramallah.\n\nThis time, Sharon explicitly linked the plan to permanently settle the Bedouin to the Jewish settlements. Regarding the Salamat clan, located in the Azzariyeh-Abu Dis area, he wrote, \u201cThe main problem the Jahalin pose is the fact that they have gained a hold on land intended for [Jewish] settlement or near it.\u201d\n\nAccording to Sharon, then, the fact that the tribes were there long before the Jewish settlements evidently gave them no rights.\n\nOn the other hand, he recognized that the Abu Dahouk, like other Bedouin communities in the Ramallah District, were suffering from the rapid shrinkage of pasture lands. But what concerned Sharon were the security considerations: The Abu Dahouk\u2019s hostility to Israel will increase, he wrote, \u201cbecause a significant portion of their pasture lands have been seized for the purpose of [Jewish] settlement.\u201d\n\nPush toward villages\n\nSharon proposed to continue encouraging Bedouin without adequate pasture lands to live in villages \u2013 a process that began a few years earlier in A-Ram (northeast of Jerusalem) and Jaba (which is east of Ramallah) \u2013 and suggested finding permanent sites for the Jahalin\u2019s summer and winter tents. Here, the military-consultant role overpowered the scholarliness of the writer, and Sharon wrote, \u201cTo facilitate the operation among the Abu Dahouk, the Bedouin task force should, in light of the rivalries within the tribe, consider the possibility of splitting it by appointing another mukhtar and submit recommendations to the district commander.\u201d\n\nIn September 1981, Capt. Harel Tzuberi, another officer charged with dealing with the Bedouin, followed Sharon\u2019s line. He knew that ever since the 1950s, the Abu Dahouk had been living between Beit Hanina and Shoafat in the summer and along the Jericho-Jerusalem highway in the winter. But he proposed concentrating them (about 500 people, according to Sharon) in one place \u2013 east of the village of Jaba. Today, this area is controlled by an outpost of the Jewish settlement of Adam.\n\nIn Tzuberi\u2019s view, either declaring this area state land or confiscating it for public purposes would entail a lengthy, complicated legal process and would be opposed by residents of the nearby villages. So he preferred a third option \u2013 \u201cmoving the Bedouin to this area without employing any legal procedure regarding the status of the land. Tell the Bedouin that they can\u2019t continue living on the Hizma-Ma\u2019aleh Adumim road and they must move to the new area.\u201d\n\nSharon and Tzuberi wrote their recommendations about two years after one of the founders of the settlement of Kfar Adumim, Uri Ariel, submitted a proposal (in early 1979) to the IDF for evicting the Bedouin from the Khan al-Ahmar area, now known as the Adumim bloc, thus creating a dense corridor of Jewish settlement there and restricting the space available for construction in Palestinian towns and villages.","created_utc":1533592361,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"White_Space_Christ","body":"It fluctuates based on the period we're in. When the ruling class needs bodies for a large ground invasion like they did in Iraq - the recruiters go out disproportionately to working class neighborhoods, thus making the composition of the US military more working class. In other periods the size of the military decreases and it relies on drones and its most ideologically faithful and reactionary core of soldiers.\n\nThe article with the opposing view I cited (The Myth of the Soldiertariat) often gets linked in these discussions. It talks about the US military as a whole being a fascist military and a \"warrior cast\" citing a Herritage Foundation study that found that most recruits have joined are from middle-class households. I think that the study itself is questionable and so is their definition of the \"middle class\". In addition to the study and its interpretation that the article is founded on being not that great of a source, I believe there are other factors at play too. I think that the economic draft combined with massive propaganda does play a role in working class people enlisting. Now, obviously there are multiple factors at play and nobody says that the entirety of the military is working class or anything like that. But what I am claiming is that there are class contradictions within the military itself that can be (and have been in the past) successfully exploited by progressive forces to slow down the war machine. And as progressives in the imperialist core we owe it to the world to carry out anti-war organizing in every way we can.","created_utc":1533598814,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"David Harvey calls this accumulation by dispossession. The question is does this analytic perspective elucidate something which was not visible before? There's a lot of thought about the continued relevance of primitive accumulation in the imperialist periphery, it's inevitable that people would try to connect it to a more general concept of primitive accumulation as an ongoing process throughout the lifespan of capitalism.\n\nSome strengths are \n\n1. that it refocuses attention to the violence of capitalism and away from ideology and hegemony, categories that have mostly exhausted their use value. \n\n2. that it discards some of the teleology of certain strains of Marxism. Instead of explaining primitive accumulation in the periphery as the result of a pre-capitalist remainder, it focuses on combined and uneven development as a process that is produced by advanced capitalism. Particularly as neoliberalism fundamentally changes the division between first and third world, theorizing a common process of accumulation by dispossession everywhere has a lot of value without committing oneself to the idea that the first and third world are the same. \n\n3. it has a lot of empirical value in explaining what happened in the post-socialist states and general robbery of social wealth that is neoliberalism. Marx's explanation of primitive accumulation is really a historical account, Harvey and others have done a lot to integrate this into a more general theoretical concept.\n\nthe weaknesses are\n\n1. it is fundamentally a process outside of capitalism. accumulation by dispossession is not a process of the market working as intended but closer to Rosa Luxemburg's theory of imperialism as capitalism consuming what is outside of itself. Both theories suffer from the same weakness: they find the cause of one of the most basic processes of capitalism not from within capitalist production but from its failure and its need to find external life support. cut off the life support and capitalism will either die or get closer to \"perfect competition,\" both options lead to shitty politics\n\n2. it is fundamentally reformist for the same reason. if neoliberalism is an immense accumulation of profit from social wealth, all we have to do is stop this accumulation. by centering the focus on accumulation, you distract from the fact that it is only one of many ways of finding surplus value and it is capitalist production which is the causal mechanism, not greed, ideology, financialization, or anything in the realm of circulation.\n\noverall, these weaknesses come more out of how Harvey has used the theory than the theory itself, which I think with some massaging is extremely useful.","created_utc":1533619652,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"PrinceKapone","body":"Youtube censoring Alex Jones and Infowars is fascism, defined as the merging of state and corporate power. Revolutionaries are engaged in a battle of ideas, an ideological struggle, where the main objective is to win the people over through the democratic method. We are concerned with propagating truthful information from a revolutionary perspective. If the right propagates misinformation, even better because we can expose to the masses how the whole program of the right is based on lies. It is to our advantage. \n\nCorporations and the state, or the corporate state rather, are also engaged in the battle of ideas, using state propaganda and fake news from the corporate media as their primary weapons. Revolutionaries should focus first and foremost on combating the propaganda of the corporate state because it currently enjoys hegemony on the ideological terrain. The corporate state (imperialism) is the principal enemy of humanity at this time. To allow the corporate state to repress either side of the political spectrum is gravely dangerous because it further consolidates corporate and state power and makes it that much easier for it to suppress ALL political dissent. \n\nIn fact, youtube and Facebook isn't just seeking to censor Info Wars and other right wing media; under the guise of combatting Russian propaganda, they are also censoring left wing, independent media. This is an attack not on one side or the other of the political spectrum, but an attack on all non-corporate, independent media. Revolutionaries cannot support this in any way. We must demand the right of free speech, trusting that truth will prevail over falsehood if we have a correct mass line and connection to the people. In the end, the right doesn't stand a chance because they are wrong and we are right, as in objectively correct.","created_utc":1533628377,"score":-3,"subreddit":"communism"}

We cannot expose the ideas of the right, because for the most part their ideas are the mainstream, their propaganda fuel for the base. To allow them the same place on the stage of ideas is dangerous, because what they advocate is oppressive violence against the most vulnerable in society.\n\n&gt;This is an attack not on one side or the other of the political spectrum, but an attack on all non-corporate, independent media.\n\nHow is a multi-million dollar propaganda machine funded by various right wing oligarchs anywhere close to \"independent\".

The rising neo-liberal elite aren't going to ban leftists from their platforms because they don't see them as a threat to their finances.\n\nThat all being said of course this is bad for the long term future.

Conservatives are honestly reaping what they sow, they advocated for years for stronger corporate power, and because their base is so rabidly racist and retrograde that not even silicon valley aristocrats can stomach it now they decide to call foul. It is hypocrisy at its finest, and personally I'm enjoying the spectacle. \n\nWe have an opportunity now to say \"I told you so\" and use this as another example of the power and influence that corporations have gained while simultaneously saying fuck Alex Jones and that he deserves no platform that is so influential to the public.\n","created_utc":1533656584,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

The US on the other hand did.  I don't know enough about China to say.  Cuba also did not commit mass genocide (like I don't think you know what that word even means), though they did have a very bloody revolution overthrowing a bloody fascists that America installed with bloody violence, Korea we forcefully occupied and then dropped the same amount of bombs as all of the WWII Pacific Theater flattening almost all structures and killing 20% of their population.  \n\n\nVirtually all of those countries have achieved remarkable economic growth and virtually eliminated things like lack of healthcare, education, food, etc.  Those of us who grew up in or experienced poverty after the recession have hidden scars that leads us to be very impressed by what these states accomplished.  If the US eliminated homelessness, poverty, hunger, and lack of healthcare within its borders and protected the rights of workers to organize and have agency over their labor, then all of the air would deflate out of any communist push.  You can't though, because capitalism demands infinite growth in a finite system and in that way is cannibalistic.  \n\n\nKorea in particular does not have \\*separation between classes\\* like you insist and while labor is mandatory, it's also a chosen profession.  IE most Koreans like the work that they do and feel connected to it because it's meaningful and they actually have a remarkable workplace democracy.  There's also a lot of things considered labor that wouldn't be here.  For example, a person who wants to be a mother might be compensated for caring for orphans.    \n\n\nThat's not to say there isn't observable problems with each of these countries, but they exist within a globe that wants to strangle them.  They are in constant fear of imperialism.  The USSR was couped and it was a humanitarian nightmare that Russia (who was just one of the member states) only recently recovered from by re-nationalizing their oil.  China dealt with it by becoming authoritarian and then by making some severe and problematic compromises with capital interests.  Cuba has remained militaristic, but thankfully staunchly democratic and internationalistic (which I think has given it the political capital to remain free).  Korea survived by having one of the largest militaries in the world, and making particular diplomatic and strategic moves.  It's shut itself off from the world almost and in that way defended itself from the covert operations that ended many of its eastern european allies.  The point is that these countries would be very different if it wasn't for the very well founded fear of our aggression.","created_utc":1533692456,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

Germany actually is one of the weaker nations in the game due to a myriad of issues it starts with). One of the outcomes is the German Reich is able to send enough troops to Russia to save the Tsars and destroy Bolshevism which means ML never comes to be and the Soviets never come to be (though you can form the Soviets in one of the many political event trees for Russia). \n\nSo anyways in this universe the big leftist ideology is instead syndicalism with the less common Totalism (essentially ML but it's more of a blanket term in this universe for all centrally planned state socialist). The only issue is that most of these syndicalist are of the anarchist sort and it doesn't make sense when these anarchist societies are making big central political choices or are commanding highly organized armies and logistics. \n\nThat's just my guess though.

{"author":"whatsunoftruth","body":"I think this is a good post, but on some points, you're giving them the benefit of doubt (which you shouldn't be).\n\nFor example:\n\n&gt;So basically he\u2019s admitted that capitalist Russia only improved after they switched from being a victim of imperialism, to themselves becoming an imperialist power coupled with tons of foreign investment, therefore it isn\u2019t a fair comparison. This is the same reason why socialists aren\u2019t interested in comparing the wealth of socialist countries with that of the capitalist west. Furthermore, claiming that \u201ceverything became better than at the time of the USSR\u201d based on GDP statistics is extremely erroneous. Why do the vast majority of former Soviet citizens say that they lived better under socialism? GDP means nothing when the vast majority of the money is in the hands of the 1%.\n\nBelieving that Russia is \"imperialist\" is sketchy by itself. That doesn't really matter in this case though, the moron literally posted a chart of Estonia. The Estonia is not the USSR. If you look up the life expectancy of all other post-Soviet republics, the increase in life expectancy was minor. 1 out of 15 republics managed to have its life expectancy crashing not as badly as the other ones - this doesn't help his argument at all.\n\nOr:\n\n&gt;Once again, this person uses evidence from the 1970s and 80s period to justify this claim, i.e when the economy had largely been reverted to capitalism and enterprises operated according to the profit motive. Also, lowering people's salaries in order to eradicate unemployment is better than having mass unemployment in the first place, as is the case increasingly in capitalist countries.\n\nThe sources for his claims were a Telegraph article, and a JSTOR article. The Telegraph article is frankly horse shit anti-Russia imperialist propaganda. It's one of those articles which try to claim modern Russia is secretly the USSR to make it look more scary. I see no sources for this. I also skimmed through the article and it doesn't even say what the Telegraph article says. The person who wrote that post is probably a smug cracker who just pick the first article on JSTOR with the word \"unemployment\" and \"USSR\" in it, and say \"see there are people who agree with me\".\n\nThe JSTOR article is also shitty though.  From what I understand, it claims the Soviet economists only acknowledge frictional unemployment. Other people who don't have jobs are considered by the USSR to be those who rejected a job offer. It doesn't even attempt to argue against this.\n\nThe article then says that the USSR and the u.$ have different definitions of \"unemployment\". It proceeded to use data from interviews and estimate the number of people who weren't working for a certain period of time, and consider all of them unemployed. Whether or not the jobs were available; whether these people rejected the jobs offer weren't dealt with at all.\n\nThe most important thing is, the USSR was able to completely escape the periodical crises which led to massive spikes in unemployment often seen in the capitalist word.","created_utc":1533722159,"score":34,"subreddit":"communism"}

This really would have been unprecedented. Although we are used to reading newspaper headlines like \u201ctens of millions face starvation in African famine\u201d it is unheard of for tens of millions to actually die in a famine. For example, the Bangladesh famine of 1974-75 is remembered as a deeply tragic event in that nation\u2019s history. However, the official death toll for the Bangladesh famine was 30,000 (out of a single-year population of 76 million), although unofficial sources put the death toll at 100,000.33 Compare this to an alleged death toll of 30 million out of a single-year population calculated at around 660-670 million for the Great Leap Forward period. Proportionally speaking, the death toll in the Great Leap Forward is meant to be approximately 35 times higher than the higher estimated death toll for the Bangladesh famine!\n\n&gt;It is rather misleading to say that all \u201cavailable evidence\u201d demonstrates the validity of the massive deaths thesis.

{"author":"KuusamoWolf","body":"Just going to latch onto the commentary regarding Finland, since that's my specialisation. I have some issues with your claims regarding this specific country.\n\n&gt; [Finland] benefited from the US bankrolling them via the Marshall Plan.\n\nThis is untrue. Finland never partook in the Marshal plan and was economically a lot closer to the USSR through the YYA-Treaty than to the West. Finland only moved economically to a Western focus around 1985 when the EEC was growing in economic importance and the Soviet sector was starting to crumble.\n\n&gt; In regards to the Soviets annexing Eastern Poland, Finland and the Baltics, they had justifiable reasons for doing so. Not only did it create a buffer between the Nazis, it also meant that millions of Jews in these countries escaped Nazi persecution.\n\nA justification on Finland was almost non-existent. The USSR justified their aggression towards Finland with the shelling of Mainila. This refers to an incident where the USSR fabricated a Finnish bombardment on one of their frontier villages. They used this false flag operation to justify a war goal on Karelia. The main justification for the conquest of Karelia was to further their influence on the Baltic Sea and create a further buffer for St. Petersburg.\n\nFurther, the justification does not even hold under a consequentialist argument. If anything, drawing Finland into the war only lengthened the second world war and allowed axis forces to combat Soviet forces on the Eastern front for longer. Adding to this, no Finnish jews were killed as a result of Nazi doctrines. On the contrary, Finnish jews made up a large portion of Finnish soldiers on the front.","created_utc":1533756326,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"corvibae","body":"This is a surprisingly common question and not the first time I've seen it on Reddit. I had a conversation at the bar across the road from my university about three or four years ago. We were a couple of pitchers deep(ah, the life of an undergraduate) and he brought this up. I don't really follow American football, but I'm a decent fan of soccer and hockey. I watch the occasional game when it's on, and I used to subscribe to this crumby little UK League Two(pretty low tier) team called Morecambe FC's internet radio station so I could listen to the games on Saturday mornings. It's a good way to pass the time, I find. \n\nAs other comrades in this sub suggested, sports are a working class invention. Soccer has its roots in a medieval sport that would take place between two villages. These people were peasants, and they played together. It was so popular, and so threatened the power of the ruling classes of Britain, that Edward III banned it in 1363. When that guy I barely know or remember asked me the question of whether or not professional sports would exist under communism, I had only one answer: of course, and it would be better. \n\nProfessional sports, as you yourself suggested, would be better. The players would care about the game, about the fans, as other comrades have suggested. The level of sportsmanship would be higher, and the games would matter more because at the end of the day all the winning side has is pride. Pride in themselves, pride in their team. Furthermore, I think that we would see a greater variety of sports played and televised rather than just the typical football or baseball games. I also think that we'd see a lot more of women's professional sports. It's rarely televised, but women's professional soccer in the U.S. is just as good as the men's teams(in particular the Houston Dash, who are just as good as the Dynamo). Players in the NWSL get paid only if they win, and not if they lose, unlike male players who get paid regardless of victory or defeat on the field. This kind of exploitation wouldn't exist under communism, and thus, female athletes would have the same opportunities for training, for playing and for games to be watched at home as well as in the stadiums.\n\nCommunism would also revolutionize other areas of professional sport. Under communism it stands to reason that athletic unions would have significantly more power than they do today. These unions, rather than being mostly focused on arguing for higher salaries and per-game-payments would be focused instead on safer conditions. Football(the American version) is awful on the human body and the repeated concussions which the players regularly suffer can result in dementia. My own grandfather, who was a local youth league boxing champion, has a form of dementia which his doctor traces to both his military service and his time as a young boxer. Other ways that sports might be changed for the better include, I think most notably, an end to corporate sponsorship of games and players. Imagine the Superbowl with a halftime show but without what amounts to an hours worth of commercials. This means more time for us to enjoy the game, and less time having to watch the same Budweiser commercial for the tenth time in a row. Imagine players who, instead of getting millions of dollars in endorsement deals, spend time training rather than shooting commercials or posing for pictures. Players who can spend the off season focusing on training and actually relaxing and being better people and better players as a result. The possibilities are endless.\n\nThose are just some isolated examples, but, to really answer your question, yes, I think that professional athletes will exist under communism. They will be, in my opinion, better people and better players than the athletes we have today. Watching the games would be more enjoyable for the viewer at home, and playing the games would be safer for the players. ","created_utc":1533876448,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

There's also the popular militias willing to fight and die against any US invasion. NATO hasn't even fully stamped out the pro-Gaddafi resistance in Libya after seven years, and Libya is a wide open country with little to no cover, while in Venezuela insurgents would have mountains and Amazon jungle to work with.\n\nThere's a reason that the Pentagon and CIA brass shot Trump down when he proposed invasion last year, and it's not because they're soft.  It would require a ton of boots on the ground to properly take the country, which the US absolutely does not want to have to do.  The continued lack of large-scale domestic antiwar dissent is largely due to the fact that the US doesn't do large scale ground invasions post-Iraq, preferring bombing, color revolutions, special forces and contractors.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, I still think Venezuela is 100 percent correct to want to avoid provoking war at all costs.

He probably took the name 'Lenin' from an individual actually named 'Lenin' whose passport he had been using. The 'N' never actually stood for anything but it was commonly assumed to stand for 'Nikolai' (or 'Nicolai'). \n\nInterestingly, Lenin never actually called himself 'Vladimir Lenin.' People started using this name for him only after his death, combining his actual first name (because the 'N' of his pseudonym didn't stand for anything) with his assumed last name because, by then, he was much more well known as 'Lenin' than as 'Ulyanov.'","created_utc":1533982578,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Lupus09","body":"I hope this information, if useful, reaches you in time. A book which you might find useful is 'The Petrograd Workers and the Soviet Seizure of Power' by David Mandel. There's a chapter in the book where Mandel talks about the Constituent Assembly and remarks that the Left SRs, with whom the Bolsheviks allied, probably had the support of about half the peasants who had voted for the SRs in the Constituent Assembly elections. Had the Constituent Assembly elections accurately reflected the split within the SR Party and assigned the Left SR faction half of the delegates given to the SR Party in the Constituent Assembly, then they would have had about 25 percent of the total delegates within the assembly (half of the SR Party's total, which came to about 50 percent of the delegates in the assembly). This, combined with the 25 percent of the Constituent Assembly delegates who supported the Bolsheviks, means that the Bolshevik-Left SR alliance would have been the ruling bloc within the Constituent Assembly. \n\nHowever, the election lists for the Constituent Assembly elections had been drawn up before the Left-Right split within the SR Party and so, the peasants who supported the Left SRs could only vote for the SR Party as a whole. The Right SRs, who controlled the party as a whole, were able to then seat Right SR delegates to represent these peasants, giving them a plurality within the Constituent Assembly instead. This is part of the reason for why the Bolsheviks disbanded the Constituent Assembly in the first place (contra liberals who like to argue that the Boshevik disbanding of the assembly was a coup which they launched when their party received only about 25 percent of the vote).","created_utc":1533984678,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

It really depends on the ideology. But all of us are against the slavery in the prison system and the express purpose of making money by private prisons. This goes hand in hand with my point of the US prison system putting people in prison even if they did nothing wrong. The more people a prison has, the more money it makes. The US justice system would implode if everyone went to court instead of 95% of cases pleading guilty. The broken justice system also puts more non-white people in prison than white people. The prison system also keeps the children of prisoners in prison as well. This increases prison population increasing profit margins.\n\nPeople get rich off of this corrupt, racist, broken system we call \u201cjustice\u201d.

{"author":"Destroyerofnoone","body":"&gt;I don\u2019t think that word means what you thing it means.\n\nSlavery: Unpaid, often times forced labor either privately owned or sponsored by the state.\n\nI mean there\u2019s wage slavery, but I\u2019m to lazy (and tired) to talk about that. \n\nForced labor is incredibly common in prisons (especially private prisons) and if the prisoners are paid (which they are in some cases not) it is below federal minimum wage. There are many prisoners paid less 1 dollar an hour. If you had saved up all of that money (even though you probably would\u2019ve tried to spend that money to get out) over the course of say, two years, making 0.50 cents an hour you would have a total of 365 dollars. Thing is, tax. So let\u2019s say you have the lowest tax rate in the US. Applying that tax rate (10%) to the 365 dollars you earned of two years you wind up with a grand total of, drumroll please! 36 dollars and 50 cents. That\u2019s two years of work. For 37 dollars (rounding up). And assuming you made 1 dollar a year you only have 73 dollars. That\u2019s barely enough to buy a AAA video game, let alone pay any debt you might have gotten from before you went to prison. They\u2019ll have even less assuming that the prisoners are charged the more likely 15% tax rate.\n\nWait that\u2019s wage slavery. No it\u2019s even less than that.\n\n&gt;The right to a fair defense shouldn\u2019t be limited by budget allocations and overworked lawyers.\n\nWell at least that\u2019s something we can agree on. It\u2019s one of the many, many reasons why the US needs a major defunding of the military (at the very least 400 billion dollars). I don\u2019t think that will actually happen unless revolution overthrows the government though.\n\n&gt;I would actually advocate the privatization of the state-sponsored DA industry.\n\nOh come I thought we agreed on something! That\u2019ll make it worse! For example, something that could very likely come from that is daily quotas the DA\u2019s are forced to meet, and if they don\u2019t they\u2019ll be fired. This could shorten the amount of time a DA has per case. This could also likely result in privately owned DA corporations making deals with private prisons behind closed doors. These deals might result in DA\u2019s having to get a certain number of people guilty per day. For my  \u201cmight result in DA\u2019s having to get a certain number of people guilty per day\u201d example, let me use GameStop. GameStop requires that it\u2019s employees sell a certain number of used copies for the games the customer buys, I believe the statistic is 2\/3s per game copy. This is done to maximize profit for GameStop, because GameStop doesn\u2019t have to pay companies money for every used copy. \n\nJust imagine that but for prison. 2\/3s of the cases the DA has to take up require the defendant to be guilty. This should be easy as we already easily hit that number in the US. The contracts the privately owned DA company makes with the private prisons make the DA company make more than they would normally, and private prisons make more money the more prisoners they have. Now I doubt it\u2019ll be two thirds (although at this point they could get away with it). Both sides win! Minus the DA, the average citizen of the US, and every single poor person. \n\nI haven\u2019t even mentioned how you\u2019ll probably be required to pay for a DA so the companies can make a profit.\n\n&gt;Helped us win the hearts and minds of the Middle East...\n\nHahaa. Nice one. That\u2019s a pretty funny joke.\n\nOh wait you\u2019re serious... LET ME LAUGH EVEN HARDER!\n","created_utc":1534048526,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

He opposed perestroika and glasnost but he had his own revisionist tendencies. \n\nFor example he was very nationalistic, even going as far to downplay Romania's role in the Holocaust. He called his idea \"national communism\". I'm personally not 100% against any form of nationalism and patriotism but I'd say he went a little too far.\n\nFurthermore he started developing friendly relations with the West after he denounced the Soviet Union and the invasion of Czechoslovakia. I've seen some people calling him a Western puppet because he was knighted by the Queen and started having tea with Nixon and stuff like that but I think he only did all that because he wanted to be more like Yugoslavia, i.e. get aid from both sides. \n\nHis biggest mistake imo was taking a ridiculous loan from the IMF. To his credit, he did manage to pay back all of Romania's debt, though he did it by temporarily raising quotas and rationing food. Romania was literally debt free at the time Ceau\u0219escu was murdered.\n\nConclusion, he was by far not the best communist leader but what followed after 1989 was by no means better. It's not uncommon to see over 50% of the people having a positive opinion on him in opinion polls. Anecdotally, my mother thinks he was the greatest Romanian leader and hates every politician that came after the revolution.","created_utc":1534062010,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

The result is similar in that you get a chorus of \"I am very smart\" young adults parroting things about which they lack the fundamental knowledge about.\n\nThere are parallels with Italy and Spain but also a lot of differences: a larger colonial empire, underdeveloped industrialisation, non participation in WW2 and absence of a civil war (although the Revolutionary Period mentioned above was close), non-adherence to Eurocommunism (in this more similar to Greece), etc. There is also a lot to be learned by the role that those calling themselves \"anti-revisionists\" played and how this can be seen today in the ultra-radicalism of internet communists (this forum included).\n\nThe Constitution, even if butchered by consecutive \"socialist\" governments, remains a rallying point of the unwavering ideals which will inevitably be realised, and as such a focus of hate by all of those who play their role in defending the system of exploitation in which they expect to be able to feast on the crumbs (I'm   petty bourgeoisie myself so I can't avoid sometimes feeling a bit indifferent when watching people trying to lick their way up when I know perfectly well what those around me actually think of them).","created_utc":1534080416,"score":9,"subreddit":"communism"}

If it takes shit kicking a cop who does nothing but defend the fascists in charge, so be it. Police in America and abroad are ALWAYS getting away with murder, and never have to live with the consequences, so when some ordinary citizen has the courage to stand up to one in the manner that this one did, it gives us hope and makes us believe it's possible to win. \n\nI understand that being outsider to this may seem like we're fetishizing this act (personally it is my new kink) but you have to realize we're all sick and tired of the oppression that goes on in the world.

At the outbreak of the war, Kropotkin and other anarchist supporters of the Allied cause advocated their position in the pages of the Freedom newspaper, provoking sharply critical responses. As the war continued, anarchists across Europe campaigned in anti-war movements and wrote denunciations of the war in pamphlets and statements, including one February 1916 statement signed by prominent anarchists such as Emma Goldman and Rudolf Rocker.\n\nAt this time, Kropotkin was in frequent correspondence with those who shared his position, and was convinced by one of their number, Jean Grave, to draft a document encouraging anarchist support for the Allies.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/communism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1534178925,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

To send a living being (dog) into space. First human. First female. First spacewalk\/Eva. First for interplanetary probe. First successful lunar impactor, picture of the far side, orbiter, lander, and soil sample return. First living things (turtles, worms, others) to orbit the moon. First to flyby and land on Venus. First to flyby, impact, and land on Mars. First space station. Excelled and perfected docking procedures and abilities. Which has seriously helped with the ISS, and short of the Mars Direct plan (see Dr. Zubrin), is the only real way to get to Mars. Excelled in rocketry, still using the same derivative of their first rocket the R7, modified throughout the years to be the Soyuz.

{"author":"JustHereForLurkin","body":"\"Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of the first importance for the revolution. The basic reason why all previous revolutionary struggles in China achieved so little was their failure to unite with real friends in order to attack real enemies. A revolutionary party is the guide of the masses, and no revolution ever succeeds when the revolutionary party leads them astray. To ensure that we will definitely achieve success in our revolution and will not lead the masses astray, we must pay attention to uniting with our real friends in order to attack our real enemies. To distinguish real friends from real enemies, we must make a general analysis of the economic status of the various classes in Chinese society and of their respective attitudes towards the revolution. . .\n\nThe petty bourgeoisie. Included in this category are the owner-peasants, [7] the master handicraftsmen, the lower levels of the intellectuals--students, primary and secondary school teachers, lower government functionaries, office clerks, small lawyers--and the small traders. Both because of its size and class character, this class deserves very close attention. The owner-peasants and the master handicraftsmen are both engaged in small-scale production. Although all strata of this class have the same petty-bourgeois economic status, they fall into three different sections. The first section consists of those who have some surplus money or grain, that is, those who, by manual or mental labour, earn more each year than they consume for their own support. Such people very much want to get rich and are devout worshipers of Marshal Chao; [8] while they have no illusions about amassing great fortunes, they invariably desire to climb up into the middle bourgeoisie. Their mouths water copiously when they see the respect in which those small moneybags are held. People of this sort are timid, afraid of government officials, and also a little afraid of the revolution. Since they are quite close to the middle bourgeoisie in economic status, they have a lot of faith in its propaganda and are suspicious of the revolution. This section is a minority among the petty bourgeoisie and constitutes its right-wing. The second section consists of those who in the main are economically self-supporting. They are quite different from the people in the first section; they also want to get rich, but Marshal Chao never lets them. In recent years, moreover, suffering from the oppression and exploitation of the imperialists, the warlords, the feudal landlords and the big comprador-bourgeoisie, they have become aware that the world is no longer what it was. They feel they cannot earn enough to live on by just putting in as much work as before. To make both ends meet they have to work longer hours, get up earlier, leave off later, and be doubly careful at their work. They become rather abusive, denouncing the foreigners as \"foreign devils\", the warlords as \"robber generals\" and the local tyrants and evil gentry as \"the heartless rich\". As for the movement against the imperialists and the warlords, they; merely doubt whether it can succeed (on the ground that the foreigners and the warlords seem so powerful), hesitate to join it and prefer to be neutral, but they never oppose the revolution. This section is very numerous, making up about one-half of the petty bourgeoisie.\n\nThe third section consists of those whose standard of living is falling. Many in this section, who originally belonged to better-off families, are undergoing a gradual change from a position of being barely able to manage to one of living in more and more reduced circumstances. When they come to settle their accounts at the end of each year, they are shocked, exclaiming, \"What? Another deficit!\" As such people have seen better days and are now going downhill with every passing year, their debts mounting and their life becoming more and more miserable, they \"shudder at the thought of the future\". They are in great mental distress because there is such a contrast between their past and their present. Such people are quite important for the revolutionary movement; they form a mass of no small proportions and are the left-wing of the petty bourgeoisie. In normal times these three sections of the petty bourgeoisie differ in their attitude to the revolution. But in times of war, that is, when the tide of the revolution runs high and the dawn of victory is in sight, not only will the left-wing of the petty bourgeoisie join the revolution, but the middle section too may join, and even tight-wingers, swept forward by the great revolutionary tide of the proletariat and of the left-wing of the petty bourgeoisie, will have to go along with the \"evolution.\" We can see from the experience of the May 30th Movement [9] of 1925 and the peasant movement in various places that this conclusion is correct.\"\n-Mao Zedong, Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society, 1926","created_utc":1534188301,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"cage433","body":"Ayn Rand - Atlas Shrugged\n\nHayek -Road to Serfdom\n\nFriedman - Capitalism and Freedom\n\nI wanted to judge neoliberalism based on what neoliberals would define as their greatest works. I'd recommend reading these to everyone, if only to see the how flimsy the arguments for their ideas are.\n\nAt the time Hayek's book was first published, several of his supporters described it as - I'm paraphrasing here - 'a bit shit'. The problem is the absolute lack of any evidence. Compare his bibliography to that Arendt's Origins of Totalitarianism, which is on roughly the same subject - Hayek's is maybe one 50th of the size. He picks some quotes from disgruntled obscure Labour politicians, adds in some game theoretic arguments, and goes 'Tadah!! Totalitarianism'. If it wasn't for the abridged readers digest version somehow hitting a chord and being a huge success it would be unknown today.\n\nFriedman - what can one say about a man who, while living in pre civil rights USA, described racism is a question of 'taste'. And that because that 'taste' is more expensive than not being racist, more capitalism implies the end of discrimination. The man who even Pinochet told to get lost cause his ideas were stupid. Like Hayek, absolutely no evidence to back up his claims, just kind of game-theoretical arguments, with no justification that the games are accurate models of society. \n\n(In fact Friedman had a tendency, not just in this book but throughout his economic writing,  to believe that the more unrepresentative his models were of society the more they were showing some deeper truth - I kid you not.)\n\nFinally - Atlas Shrugged. Hard to describe what a nasty, stupid, fascistic and terribly written novel this is. The capitalists are all tall, thin, beautiful - and also incredible engineers\/managers\/visionaries - which justifies their fantastic wealth. They are also better at working class jobs than the working class, who only pop in to the story very occasionally to offer support to the capitalists, or in one case to describe at length the downfall of a factory run with a socialist philosophy, or rather what Rand imagined might be socialist. \n\nDespite her intellectual pretensions I very much doubt Rand ever read Marx. She claimed to have learnt from Aristotle but her attempts to co-opt his philosophy, which involves a 100 page speech attempting to justify free markets from first principles, is frankly embarrassing.

{"author":"TheFoxandGrapes","body":"I just don't find these criticisms very useful. Now I'm not some philosophical savant by any means, but I have always been more keen on post-modernism than other comrades as I find their (and anarchists) critique of power to be the most apt. \n\nI will attempt (and probably poorly) to address some of the issues I have with this piece. \n\nFirstly, and probably a petty complaint is of course it portrays Nietzsche as some form of proto-fascist which is more of a stereotype than an actual observation. Fascist ideology which used his analysis as a justification for their despicable programs were based on an ignorance of his writing not an accurate depiction of them. Nietzsche ultimately was trying to reconcile slave\/master morality. He most definitely was not perfect, but such a simplistic criticism of him is old and tired.\n\n&gt;The positive thrust of anarchism is directed towards the vindication of \u2018natural society\u2019, i.e. a self-regulated society of individuals and freely-formed groups. Marx and Engels saw it as a petty bourgeois phenomenon. The attack was not against the actual state but an abstract state that nowhere exists.\n\nThis is an interesting comment and somewhat gets to a root issue I have with materialism which I will bring up later, but why does this abstract state not exist? Of course it does; it is the amalgamation of  forces in which the state monopolizes and uses as a means of domination. \n\n&gt;Moreover anarchism denied what was essential in the struggle for the emancipation of the working class: political action by an independent working-class party leading to conquest, not the immediate destruction of political power.\n\nThis is just not true. Anarchists have routinely taken up arms to establish their causes. I simply don't understand why people try and frame the Spanish Civil War as something other than an anarchist action despite the honest and real criticism that can be made against it. What is revolution if not a political action? The critique of political power by anarchist is still in my mind valid, it a tool of domination, and domination of humans is inexcusable. One could counter that it is necessary to use the state apparatus for the dictatorship of the proletariat and I would agree, but that is not the point of the critique. A tool of domination exists for its own means; it has its own momentum, its own agenda so to speak. \n\n&gt;But what Foucault presented as all-pervading power without any proper theorisation on tackling them is in reality the presentation of a fearsome picture of a monster with countless tentacles keeping uninterrupted surveillance on all of us who are reduced to helplessness in perpetuity.\n\nThat's exactly what the state is; for good or bad. It is by its very nature totalitarian. Any restraints put on it are limited and ultimately can only be cemented if upheld by paragons of limitless virtue which is impossible.\n\n&gt;but in inseparable connection or unity with other objects, etc. are some of the important examples of this inter-connection and unity with nature. In history, the general trend in the world is to move from a primitive socio-economic system and relations to machine-based higher stage of economic and social system.\n\nPerhaps this whole article has somewhat disturbed me, but I fail to see why since we have seen what appears to be a trend in the momentum of history towards greater economic development we have arrived at the conclusion that communism is the next step. Human and economic development have so greatly changed over the last couple hundred year, and their effects upon us and the planet are so much more dramatic than previous systems that I find the inevitability of socialism to be called into question. I am not saying that socialism is not possible, again just not inevitable.\n\n&gt;There may be short-lived ruptures in this process. Marx cited the example of the attacks of barbarian tribes to overrun the Roman Empire bringing about a sort of break in the then advanced socio-economic structure (Grundrisse). \n\nHow is  possible annihilation through man made weapons a short lived rupture, or climate change that could potentially kill all surface dwelling beings (or beyond)?\n\n&gt;Post-modern view, must not have to work out any programme, must not have to have any theory and goal. Thus we are led to a world full of uncertainty, with no future of an advanced civilization. When such a theory is blended with the notion of never-possible-change in the power structure spread from top to bottom we are thrust into a world of frustration and futility. Foucault thus ends his ostensible tirade against the systemic power and oppression by projecting a state of permanent human bondage.\n\nI fail to see what this observation is supposed to accomplish other than to really unfairly brand post-modernism as defeatist. I don't like individuals making claims or criticisms without offering solutions either, but that doesn't mean those things are not valid nor worth considering by those of us who wish to participate in more direct action actually do so.\n\n&gt;It is an irony of history that while the anarchists like Bakunin, Cropotkin et al advocated some adventurous actions against the oppressive regimes, our present day post-modernists\/post-structuralists in general are too timid for any effective action against US imperialism and its international role of exploitation and barbarous attacks on all opponents of its interests.\n\nOne could make this statement against all current socialist movements. This is not a defeatist attitude, but an accurate description of the current conditions on the ground. No modern movement has come close to toppling a system which is global in scale and influence. China is the only political actor with the political influence to actually make some changes, and as it stands they are waist deep within the global capitalist economy.\n\n&gt;In reality our sense organs do not deceive us. In Mao\u2019s view sensory or perceptual knowledge takes a dialectical leap in the brains to reach the level of conceptual knowledge. Logical cognition or the conceptual knowledge is a higher state of knowledge resulting from generalised activities of man\u2019s reason, the painstaking process of a vast mass of data furnished by sensory knowledge. Concepts also reflect the changing world, the constantly developing practice, and hence they themselves must be flexible and mobile. Other forms of thought-judgement and conclusions are formed on the basis of concepts. It is in order to mention it that while the supporters of empiricism underestimate the role of abstract thought or knowledge, accepting only sense-impressions, the supporters of rationalism do not believe in the sense-organs and consider reason or abstract thought the sole source of true knowledge. Marxism places three interconnected basis of knowledge \u2014 sensory, human practice in constituting social life and concept.\n\nI could just being a bit obtuse here but I really don't get this. Our senses in combination with society are not together sufficient to determine what truth actually is. This completely ignores the idea that there are elements of reality that exist yet are completely imperceptible to human beings. If any such thing exists the truth of reality is completely unreachable by the human mind.  Human beings have a generalized sense of truth, but we are still limited by the way our brains are designed. We understand the world we interact with; which very well might not be anywhere close to the reality which actually is. Human reality is just that, human. We are not the arbiters of what truth is and is not. but maybe that is inevitable until we encounter another intelligence capable of articulating some ontology.

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"To give a better answer, this is the limit of RT. The secret to victory in Vietnam (and China and Korea beforehand) was land reform: once socialists changed class relations in the countryside, it was a matter of national survival to resist imperialism and the forces of former colonial occupiers and landlords. Nationalism and resistance became one and the same because socialism for the first made peasants into political subjects and created the conditions for a sovereign nation state. The colonial state wasn't some fascist dictatorship, under colonialism most people simply lived impoverished lives, living and dying by the dictates of nature. It was socialism that harnessed these otherwise invisible subjects, which made victory inevitable just like the Union harnessing the slaves as political subjects made the victory of the American bourgeoisie inevitable.\n\nRT has come to accept a kind of non-socialist anti-imperialism which is not right wing but appeals to many on the right in the first world. It's not capable of distinguishing the essence from the appearance of anti-imperialism. Think of it as bourgeois nationalism in the semi-periphery which resists imperialism in the main but is also incapable of a proletarian line. Afghanistan remains semi-feudal and neither the Taliban or the US have any interest in changing this. Which means, practically speaking, that for most Afghanis these forces simply don't exist except as alien forces that take a tithe or loot every once in a while and life remains in a state of semi-serfdom. One can read of Afghani villages being traded back and forth between different forces without any change in ideology, just different people to pay taxes to, something unimaginable if for example the United States were occupied. It's not that the fight between the Taliban and the US misses the real struggle like people claimed in Syria to justify supporting invisible forces who happened to be aligned with imperialism. It's that Afghanistan has been destroyed as a nation since the collapse of the socialist government, with Pakistani mercenaries and American backed compradors fighting for scraps. I would imagine the conditions today in Afghanistan are somewhat like the conditions of Poland during the first partition. The collapse of the USSR has thrown many countries into a state even before the 1791 bourgeois constitution (of Poland), leaving nothing but reactionary forces to fight over the right to extreme exploitation of primitive labor. This is the world we find ourselves in, and it is the world in which we make political choices rather than pretending we live in a different world.

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"The sentence you quoted is just \"folksy\" knowledge without any real content. None of the terms of the problem are defined, nor is any causality posited between specific changes and transformation of the capitalism mode of production. \"Inevitable\" in Marxist terms means that causal mechanisms arise out of contradictions within the basic structural logic of a mode of production and that these mechanisms cannot be changed as long as the contradiction at the heart of the system still holds. Whether this makes socialism \"inevitable\" is simply a matter of the level of abstraction. Are we talking about the power of individuals? Classes? The world market? Life on Earth? Gravity is \"inevitable\" at a broad level of abstraction, and yet we have learned to fly. \n\ne: What that person is trying to say is that ecological catastrophe has changed the terms of the problem and introduced the possibility that capitalism will be aborted by the end of life before it can finish its historical trajectory as a developer of the forces of production. This derives from a misunderstanding of capitalism, which takes environmental cost as given (or in Marxist terminology, as constant capital). The forces of production are always riven by the contradiction between use and exchange value and therefore relative to the mode of production. Are smartphones an \"advance\" in our level of technology? We can leave that to cultural critics, Marxism does not have an opinion except if such technology is an advance in relation to the production of surplus value. Capitalism of course is interested in lowering the cost of natural resources and the Earth's means of production more generally, but this is only one cost among many which can be made up for in other ways. It is the production of surplus value that is the core of capitalism and the source of its historical boundedness, everything else is ancillary. Much of our science fiction is about this for this reason, as our cultural products are far more aware of Marxism than so called intellectuals. Not only can we imagine extreme conditions of exploitation coexisting with a collapsing ecosystem, it is already the case throughout much of the third world.

Until things get much, *much* worse in the advanced capitalist countries, this is a waste of time.

This is why people are starting to think anti-imperialism.org is a fraud.\n\nInstead of worrying about questions about organizing 'workers' in the First-World, we should be asking ourselves how to either *capture* the institutions that represent them in the first place, or how to *fight* the labor bureaucrats that are irreconcilable to the goals of anti-imperialism.\n\nA revolutionary Third-Worldist shouldn't ever be asking themselves \"How do I organize workers?\" They should be asking themselves \"How do I fight labor bureaucrats?\"\n\nThere are *many* creative possibilities in this regard, none of which involve you becoming an organizer for a union. In fact, if a Third-Worldist wants to do revolutionary union activity, they should just go look for job that is *already* unionized, and start *agitating* inside their union from there.\n\nFailing that, there are all sorts of other ways to apply political pressure *outside* of the union bureaucracy on to the labor bureaucrats. Why don't Third-Worldists start an organization like USLAW (US Labor Against War), go to places where workers\/unionists congregate, setup a table and sign people up. Then slowly *agitate* whoever signs up against the labor leaders. You could even 'mass-line' this, if you wanted to.\n\nFor those recruits more into direct action, get them to organize protests outside the yearly conventions of the AFL-CIO. It doesn't take a lot of money to make a sign calling Richard Trumka a Zionist (though it takes some politics guts to hold it up while screaming \"AFL-CIA, AFL-KKK!\" or something).\n\nThis is the level *genuine* anti-imperialists should be thinking at when it comes to union activity, not some abstract issue about organizing people who don't produce surplus value.","created_utc":1534334153,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

And I find that mindfulness practices could be really beneficial, especially when practicing self-criticism or hearing criticism from comrades. I also feel like both tend to prioritize material conditions over ideas and perceptions. A lot of teachings from Buddhism stress investigating the nature of reality, cause and effect, and the way everything is conditioned and dependent on other things. One could draw parallels between this and dialectical materialism. \n\nObviously this is a little oversimplified. I don't claim to be an expert on Buddhism or communism, and I'm sure others could find ways to contrast the two and show that they oppose each other. The situation in Tibet is a good example, and there are others.

{"author":"Dritteweltistin","body":"To begin, I'd like to thank you for engaging with the points in this article in an honest way, even though I feel there's been some major misconceptions. Other than the unsubstantiated comment about people thinking of [Anti-Imperialism.org](https:\/\/Anti-Imperialism.org) (and by extension, RAIM) as \"frauds\" I think this is a good starting point for a genuine discussion on its points. \n\nSo, let's deal with this one at a time. Firstly the encouragement of class struggle within the seat of the empire is not a call for union activity, this is perhaps one of the biggest misconceptions which, to self-criticize, I believe is due in part to the article's vagueness on points that should have had an ironclad clarity. Class struggle does not mean that one should look to organize or extend control of the organized labor bureaucracy in areas it's explicit political influence is weak or nascent. Rather, we should be trying to build our own institutions, and first that means understanding what the modern labor aristocratic union is structured like, and  building something that not only is revolutionary in form, but communist in content in its place.\n\nThe modern union is an apparatus which serves a single basic purpose, which is to negotiate contracts with business leaders so as to ensure a \"fair\" shake with the workers, and to represent their interests in legal proceedings, organize strikes when contract terms are broken, etc. Also, it serves to punish workers for violating \"their end\" of agreements. These agreements, at their core, represent the stable recognition of bourgeois right and the status of the imperialist system. It is so exclusively about the number of hours and wages that it rarely concerns itself with any deeper political questions, if ever. These institutions, even when infiltrated, are useless to us because they fundamentally exist to negotiate agreements with the bourgeoisie for the sake of parasitic and bourgeois advances in station. So assuming we can operate within them (with the labor bureaucracy serving to sanction us if we fall out of line, or disrupt their agreements) we would have to become some sort of tool in their arsenal, ultimately instrumentalized for capitalism-imperialism.\n\nMoreover, the labor bureaucracy is actively shrinking. Their rights are curtailed in the courts as bourgeois revanchists trade individual wage increases and a stable economy for the overbearing labor bureaucracy that has long been seen by the privileged working class in the FW as something that hampers their progress, rather than provides for it. Why should we integrate into a sinking ship? We should be using the intensification in conflict between the bourgeoisie and their labor aristocracy, in a time of looming crisis, to build independent working class organization that rejects the foundations of this system. That is not meant to sound easy, however. Certainly, we must content with a weakened, yet still powerful labor bureaucracy, as well as the greater labor aristocracy which in general resists the bourgeoisie only from the vantage point given to them by the cycle of \"class struggle\" played out over and over by the bureaucratic labor movement. On top of that, the general apathy of people who are provided for, meagerly in some cases, but nevertheless are in no danger of immediate starvation. All of this must be overcome, and can be, if we focus the existing contradictions toward an illumination of these conditions.\n\nThe subjective alone cannot account for the full transformation in class structures, so this shouldn't be seen as the only thing we must do, but it is the most important pending the next general crisis in imperialism, when revolutionary conditions will hopefully present themselves. What is clear is that the general revanchism that is present within the policy of the bourgeois state will get worse as they fail to make their necessary dividends, between the trade war and a collapsing imperial reach, the amerikan empire is not in good health, so a crisis is not only possible in the near future, but likely. If such trends in policy continue, the moment that the imperial flow of value is cut off or seriously interrupted, will likely spark an offensive on the part of the bourgeoisie to save their society through gutting the privileges they had given their own workers, and without the penetration of communist propaganda and organizational instruments, either the labor aristocracy will rise to meet them, and sideline us, or the working class movement, right-wing or left, will be decimated in its wake. We cannot take advantage of revolutionary situations that we have not yet cultivated with our activity.\n\nNow, to deal more specifically with your recommendations of what to do in place of this, I think that you have some interesting points that are worth considering, but on the whole we cannot carry out endless agitation and propaganda without 1) people to do it, and 2) some way to transform it into useful political momentum (i.e. capture it with institutions that project power and discipline). This requires organizing workers as well as challenging their appointed leaders. If we just challenge their validity, through actions that you've suggested (which I think are good ideas for the most part) then we have undermined them, but we have not really effectively presented ourselves as a good alternative. They answer to conditions, even if they do so in a reactionary way, we would only be presenting our own rhetoric, which we do on a nearly daily basis anyways, and which has not sufficed on its own to build the revolutionary movement.\n\nCertainly there is the danger that we could be subsumed into labor aristocratic politics, or that those we organize among may come to resent us. The former must be actively agitated against constantly, but ultimately we will have a much stronger position to struggle against this tendency from outside of the very institutions dominated by the organized labor aristocracy. We must maintain our own discipline, affirm our own ideological principles, and although we must understand the workers and individuals we organize among, we must not tail them. To be aware of these deviations is half the battle, and to combat them can only be made effective with the discipline and organizational rigor that can only be found within our own institutions. That doesn't mean we shouldn't agitate within theirs, but it means that the principal axis of our work should be in our own, for our own ends, and in opposition to the bureaucratic and collaborationist institutions built by our class enemies.\n\nUltimately these are not \"abstract principles\" but they are concrete needs. The article in its first few sentences lays out precisely why this stratum is important to consider. Even if we go back to MIM's analysis, which we wholeheartedly accept, that the lumpenproletariat could also serve as a large revolutionary mass base, we also have to consider the fact that the lumpenproletariat also do not produce surplus value by and large. So no matter what, all of our considerations still revolve around how to ultimately link these in an ironclad way to the centers of production, productive workers and principally the proletariat. Ultimately this is a question that \\*much\\* more remains to be written on, and the article in question is, as it says in the conclusion, only an introduction to this discussion. One that we invite every genuine anti-imperialist to participate in, as you have, and we thank you for it.","created_utc":1534392151,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"nice_try_western_spy","body":"oof, we're getting a lot of these right now for some reason. \n\nno, we do not support one guy controlling everything. we do support the dictatorship of the proletariat, which means the working class (instead of the capitalist class) controls the state and society. what usually happens when a socialist country pops up is that the capitalist ones just spam their population with all sorts of crazy lies and exaggeration in order to make them scared enough not to become socialist. \n\n&gt;\"in the United States, for over a hundred years, the ruling interests tirelessly propagated anticommunism among the populace, until it became more like a religious orthodoxy than a political analysis. During the Cold War, the anticommunist ideological framework could transform any data about existing communist societies into hostile evidence. If the Soviets refused to negotiate a point, they were intransigent and belligerent; if they appeared willing to make concessions, this was but a skillful ploy to put us off our guard. By opposing arms limitations, they would have demonstrated their aggressive intent; but when in fact they supported most armament treaties, it was because they were mendacious and manipulative. If the churches in the USSR were empty, this demonstrated that religion was suppressed; but if the churches were full, this meant the people were rejecting the regime\u2019s atheistic ideology. If the workers went on strike (as happened on infrequent occasions), this was evidence of their alienation from the collectivist system; if they didn\u2019t go on strike, this was because they were intimidated and lacked freedom. A scarcity of consumer goods demonstrated the failure of the economic system; an improvement in consumer supplies meant only that the leaders were attempting to placate a restive population and so maintain a firmer hold over them. If communists in the United States played an important role struggling for the rights of workers, the poor, African-Americans, women, and others, this was only their guileful way of gathering support among disfranchised groups and gaining power for themselves. How one gained power by fighting for the rights of powerless groups was never explained. What we are dealing with is a nonfalsifiable orthodoxy, so assiduously marketed by the ruling interests that it affected people across the entire political spectrum.\" - (michael parenti) \n\ni suggest watching [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Okz2YMW1AwY) to clear some things up, once you actually try to pick under the surface you begin to realize how baseless a lot of capitalist claims are. \n","created_utc":1534395601,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

Moreover wars of aggression are just one tool in the imperialism handbook.\n\n\n&gt; This is the popular axis on which an answer to \"how, in the common struggle against imperialism, can concrete class struggles be articulated both in the center and in the periphery?\" can be based but I'm sure we can come up with a more effective platform based on a real analysis.\n\nIt's almost non-existent, the number of people in America who care both about their own lack of healthcare and their government's proclivity for manipulating, destabilizing, and infantilizing the countries of other people. The US is not dropping bombs on Yemen, it is providing support for the country that is dropping those bombs. That support materializes on the American end in cheaper petroleum based products, stabilized markets, employment those things in turn trickle down and inform and innumerable number of things that make western lives more comfortable. All those things are just one small facet of the action of dropping bombs on a defenseless country, not even taking into account how the purchase of those weapons benefits Americans, the transport of them, their existence at large. \n\nHow do you propose the struggle for healthcare provides an answer for those benefits born out of the decimated bodies of people abroad? Centering healthcare will only do as much as provide healthcare for Americans (if we're lucky.) We cannot build a better, more just world on its back, and we certainly can't raise class consciousness beyond the point of \"I deserve healthcare regardless of my income.\" Our politics is bigger than this question and centering it only limits the questions our politics can answer.\n\n&gt; I'd also like to throw out there that the Yemeni genocide has expressly not received \"media exposure\". This is important even though what you said about material interests vs. ideological control is true\n\nBecause it doesn't serve anyone in America to cover it.","created_utc":1534487447,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"throwawayacctcommie","body":"Thanks for the response.\n\n&gt; Class struggle does not mean that one should look to organize or extend control of the organized labor bureaucracy in areas it's explicit political influence is weak or nascent. Rather, we should be trying to build our own institutions, and first that means understanding what the modern labor aristocratic union is structured like, and building something that not only is revolutionary in form, but communist in content in its place.\n\nThis sounds like building Red unions to me, which is fine and all, but you're not gonna win over the people you think you can. There are already a few Red unions in North America, and they're extremely tiny. Moreover, the history of the CIO should tell you that anything you build like this, can easily be taken away from you. Witness how quickly the communists lost control of the CIO.\n\nIn all honestly, the distinction some of the cruder MIM-remnants made between a mass-line and an \"ass-line\" are appropriate here. You can't do mass-line politics without any *masses* to begin with. Even the most exploited people inside the borders of 'America' don't want anything to do with Red unions (I'm thinking about my own experience with the CiW, which was controlled by people affiliated with the 'Left Unity' FRSO). If you tried to build some Red unions, you'd find no one would join you, then you'd try something else, because as long as *you* control it, who cares how openly Red it is anyway? If you were successful with that (not likely, and this isn't a comment about any perceived organizational capabilities of RAIM people), you would find yourself gravitating more and more toward normal labor aristocracy politics, *even if* you represented the most exploited people you could actually find inside North America.\n\nI honestly don't think building independent institutions, if by independent institutions you mean Red unions, is helpful at all. What I propose instead is focusing on people amenable to anti-imperialist politics, and getting them to do *illegal* things. It would certainly be possible to recreate the [Blekingegade Gang](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blekingegade_Gang) in North America. Not to sound like an asshole, but religious cults can recruit people to kill themselves and their family members, based on wacky beliefs. Locating and recruiting individual people like this should be the priority of any anti-imperialist organization.\n\n&gt;What is clear is that the general revanchism that is present within the policy of the bourgeois state will get worse as they fail to make their necessary dividends, between the trade war and a collapsing imperial reach, the amerikan empire is not in good health, so a crisis is not only possible in the near future, but likely.\n\nI honestly think you are underestimating the strength of the enemy here, which can lead to ideas which will ultimately put you under the control of the Democratic Party and their various 'Left' appendages. Allow me to try to convince you of that.\n\nWhen the 'workers' in North America are under serious threat of being proletarianized, you should see more serious political disruptions on the Right first. And by this, I mean a serious rise in white nationalism, and not the internet phenomenon known as the Alt-Right. This thing exists to fulfill a function the Republican Party can no longer openly do, as they have been pushed into a corner when it comes to this stuff. And if you investigate closely, you'll see the people in charge of this nebulous thing called the Alt-Right are basically also trying to *contain* any political breaches from erupting into open violence with the government and the institutions meant to pacify them on the Right.\n\nSakai wasn't wrong when he said the US government doesn't view blacks, communists, immigrants, anarchists, etc, as their primary domestic threat. And Sakai wasn't wrong when he said their primary threat was from white nationalists. We should take Sakai seriously in this regard, and use white nationalist violence as a sort of barometer. Increases in white nationalist violence, especially from young white men, are indicators of the most threatening political pressures that are building up, that the system is unable to relieve by traditional methods (outright bribery).\n\nUntil we begin to see this sort of violence in a much, *much* higher  quantity than we currently do, we shouldn't pretend a revolutionary situation is not far off. I personally don't think we should even consider that to be the case *until* this violence is actually organized by a self-described white nationalist organization.\n\nIf we are honest with ourselves, we should admit that the potential for organized political violence is much lower on the Left in North America. The Democratic Party and their 'Left' appendages have an ideological stranglehold on most people inclined to anti-imperialist and revolutionary politics, and this situation isn't going to change any time soon.\n\nThe opposite is not the case on the Right in North America. There are simply too many political contradictions for the Republican Party and various other Right organizations to paper over. When the flow of surplus value is cut off to the white population, they will revolt against those institutions, and they won't be running to anything calling itself Marxist or communist.\n\nMoreover, assume I am wrong about all this. Then what will happen? They'll just stick with the US government, all the way to the end. If the white population in North America ponders the issue and rejects white nationalism, they have *nowhere* else to go. They'll just accept the political disciplining of the two parties (if you could call those government institutions actual political parties) forever. 'America' could very easily look like Greece under SYRIZA, and could probably go even further 'Left' than that, and the Democratic Party could easily be taken there if they had no political choice. The Republican Party, on the other hand, can't even seem to handle Trump, a Hollywood liberal from Queens. It could *never* handle a David Duke on the national stage.\n\nMarxism-Leninism can still recruit masses of people, and can attract people ideologically hardened enough to commit violent political acts. Perhaps if we were to look at another relevant historical example, it would be the Spanish Communists, who continued fighting the Franco regime for years after the war ended. While I would say outright violence at this stage is not necessary, a systematic process of undermining the political system should be the goal of people who want to fight imperialism. Again, there are many creative things that could be done in this regard, but the first thing to do is to locate people who are amenable to anti-imperialist ideology and willing to do illegal activities to further this goal.","created_utc":1534492546,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Though to answer the question, according to the constitution of the Communist Party of China, \"The realization of communism is the highest ideal and ultimate goal of the Party\":  \n  \n&gt;The Communist Party of China takes Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of Three Represents and the Scientific Outlook on Development as its guide to action.\n\n&gt;Marxism-Leninism brings to light the laws governing the development of the history of human society.

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"Capitalism does not need your consent, merely your passive acquiescence. No one actually thinks capitalism is any good, the reason arguments for sweatshops are notable is because of how absurd they are to normal people. There's a reason true pro-capitalist libertarianism and alt-right fascism appeals to the most pathetic losers of our society. Everyone else is already aware of how awful capitalism is, they just are not incentivized towards the revolutionary violence it would take to overthrow it. Pointing out the crimes of normal capitalism that far surpass anything done by revolutionary dictatorships of the proletariat misses why people actually passively acquiesce to capitalism. You can perhaps get honest liberals to admit how anti-capitalist they really are but that's about it. In general ideology as an explanation for active shaping of false consciousness is vastly overblown, despite billions spent on capitalist propaganda, the only thing Nancy Pelosi did when she said the Democrats are for capitalism is make everyone cringe.\n\nNor is a better strategy pointing out how Cuba or the former USSR secretly live up to the desires of first world consumerism and identity politics, that will never attract more than an aienated fringe since those societies are not for us and do not correspond to our particular fantasies. All of these have been tried. What is to be done was an interesting question 50 years ago during the height of the new left but it's largely irrelevant now. If the former left was torn between Western and Eastern Marxism (to use Losurdo's framing) and the needs of delinking in the East with the ideological hegemony and monopoly of productive forces in the West, then the only thing left is ideological hegemony. China doesn't need us anymore, in time we'll come around to Marxism in the new world that is coming into being. The west is dead and production will never come back, all that remains is to see how this will be fought out in the realm of politics and ideology.\n\nHaving said all that it's important for communists to learn about these things. As first worlders we have a kind of class \"instinct\" towards reformism and liberalism, for Indian peasants the Irish famine is the norm of capitalism but for us it seems far away, making the possibilities of a \"good\" capitalism seem possible. We have to remind ourselves constantly what capitalism really is in its *normal* form, not as some exceptional fascism or backwards third world version.","created_utc":1534620108,"score":22,"subreddit":"communism"}

Just as a curious communist, who happens to be a member of the International Solidarity Committee in my state, I made some studies on countries along with our \\[UJC - Union of the Communist Youth, youth branch of PCB - Brazilian Communist Party\\] built international alliances inside (but not only) WFDY. Since there is no official statement, I ran through some possible answers and debates in groups, reddit, etc. Some few make sense (namely democratic centralism \\[the matter on conferences and congresses\\] and tactics) and a lot of them don't. Regardless, let's number some important questions:\n\n1. Tactics. I happen to find the PSL approach much more open, and much more active. This - but not only - brought the sympathy of working class and left-wing leaning people torwards them and tends to keep doing it. Take, **for example only**, the number of likes in their pages. 8,300 for WWP against almost 30k for PSL really tells us something about a split only 14 years old. Like Lenin used to say, *practice* *is the criterion of truth.*\n2. The coup in Brazil. I know it sounds out of my mind to bring this, but a bad understanding of the international situation is worrisome. The Workers Party here, the one Dilma Rousseff is a member, is not much better than the Democrats. In fact, some particularities aside, they are quite alike. And the Workers Party note on that seems to be very complacent and permissive with a lot of neoliberal measures, almost adopting their speech in full. What happened here was not at all the good social-democrats *vs* evil capitalists. On that matter, [PSL note](https:\/\/www.liberationnews.org\/there-wont-be-a-coup-there-will-be-struggle\/), while not breaking 100% with this view, was still much more dense, complex and accurate. Also, the Workers Party points to our next item\n3. Proximity with PCdoB. Very quick: PCdoB is a 1962 split from PCB. They were first maoists, then hoxhaists, now they are just the brazilian version of CPUSA really. For comparison, PCB followed the soviet line until 1991, when we were almost dismantled by opportunists (Roberto Freire, if you wish to search) and that struggle against them along with the end of the Soviet Union brought us back to the M-L tracks. Workers Party seems to be very friendly with PCdoB and, as you could imagine, a lot of their international analysis was dragged from them, who first dragged directly from the uncritical speech of PT (Workers Party). They are just as auxiliary line to PT as CPUSA is to the Democrats.\n4. Trump. On the other hand, [PSL reading on 2016 elections](https:\/\/www.liberationnews.org\/united-states-of-trump-whats-at-stake-the-fight-back-begins\/) was much more sober, critical and, again, more dense, complex (just like reality is, and in that terms it looks a lot more of a leninist analysis) and accurate. WWP failed for too long to understand the situation correctly - and I think [this note demonstrates it clearly](https:\/\/www.workers.org\/2016\/11\/01\/trump-clinton-and-the-fbi\/): one week before the election and they were still placing the bet on Clinton over some abstract preference of Hillary by a supposed unified bourgeoisie because of being a person from inside the state. Sure, you can say that in late 2016 the contradictions between branches of the US bourgeoisie weren't that clear, but if we in Brazil were able to see that (and I remember clearly how we noticed Trump talking directly to the proletariat who lost their jobs at the industries), you could've done that too.It was at this moment that it attracted the attention of a lot of our comrades that can read english (6 of my FB comrades like WWP page, 21 likes PSL), because our readings matched perfectly, and this have hugely been the case ever since.  \n\n\nEDIT: I got the numbering wrong LOL","created_utc":1534646849,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"DoubleOil","body":"Agreed.  To further this, and to re-iterate that any \"good\" Marxist-Leninist should strive to, \"close all doors against belief in the supernatural\", as \"people who can be induced to believe in the non-materiality of nature are capable of believing anything.\"\n\nI have an excerpt that speaks to this topic from a Marxist-Leninist stance, in the book titled \"Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism\":\n\n&gt; \u201cMastery of the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism requires serious and thoughtful study and, consequently, much work and time. What are the fruits of such a study?\n\n&gt; Put briefly, the answer is that it gives us an integral world outlook, the most progressive outlook of our time, one in which the cardinal components of the great teachings of Marx and Lenin are blended in a harmonious, integral system.\n\n&gt; There are various kinds of world outlook, whether progressive or reactionary. Some of the latter are based on ancient beliefs and superstitions and seek to persuade religious-minded people that they must remain blindly dependent upon some supernatural being and his vicars and anointed regents on earth. Other philosophies, while not openly asserting the existence of a deity and even avowing faith in \u201cscience\u201d resort to subtle but false arguments in an effort to destroy man\u2019s conviction of the real existence of the material world.\n\n&gt; That is the method used by the exponents of the most fashionable trends in modern idealism. Many of them do not themselves believe in the existence of supernatural forces but, influenced by the traditional conventions and prejudices of bourgeois society, are unwilling to close all doors against belief in the supernatural. New discoveries in science, they say, cast doubt on the materiality of nature. And the theologians and clerics support them, on the assumption that people who can be induced to believe in the non-materiality of nature are capable of believing anything.\n\n&gt; Not everything that imitates science is real science, just as not everything that glitters is gold. And particularly in our time many varieties of idealist philosophy eagerly assume a scientific guise in order to conceal their anti-scientific substance. In reality, they fear the weighty evidence of scientific facts and seek to hush up or distort these fact.\n\n&gt; Marxism-Leninism has great merits that distinguish it from all other philosophical systems.\n\n&gt; It does not recognize the existence of any supernatural forces or creators. It rests squarely on reality, on the real world in which we live. It liberates mankind, once and for all, from superstition and age-old spiritual bondage. It encourages independent, free and consistent thought.\n\n&gt; Marxism-Leninism regards the world as it actually is, without adding an invented hell or paradise. It proceeds from the fact that all nature, including man himself, consist of matter with its different properties.\n\n&gt; Nature, as well as all its individual phenomena, is in constant process of development. The laws of that development have not been ordained by God and do not depend on man\u2019s will. They are intrinsic in nature itself and are fully knowable. There are no inherently unknowable things in the world; there are only things which are still unknown, but which man will increasingly get to know.\u201d \u2013 Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, Manual; Second Edition, Foreign Languages Publishing House Moscow 1963, pages 15-16.","created_utc":1534673158,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"hnnmw","body":"I read the French translation a couple of years ago. I found it in line with Losurdo's other more polemic work as to form and quality of argumentation.\n\nI liked it. It debunked many of the myths I still naively assumed \"must have been at least kinda true\", argues for a discursive, politico-ideological critique of the figure of Stalin, traces historical lines of these figures (showing, for example, how much of the early anti-Stalin propaganda was just rehashed Nazi lies, how Stalin's so-called antisemitism was constructed, etc.), and contextualises many of the mistakes made under Stalin\u015b leadership, oftentimes absolutised and\/or personified in the figure Stalin by bourgeois intellectuals. (If you're interested in Losurdo's main train of thought, you might also be interested in this excellent article of his: http:\/\/awm.or.kr\/bbs\/data\/document\/1\/Losurdo___Critique_of_Totalitarianism_(2004).pdf)\n\nI remember some friends liking it less. They criticised it for attempting to whitewash Stalin.\n\nI agree that Losurdo, as with some of his other works, sometimes seems to prioritise polemics over concrete analyses. All in all not my favourite Losurdo book (he will be greatly missed!), but Budgen's \"criticism\" is obviously totally misplaced, malicious, and ridiculous.\n\nEdit: I could add that I greatly preferred it to Ludo Marten's book (Un autre regard sur Staline, mentioned bellow), which is not strange considering the time-frame (opening of archives, prior scientific work, political context, etc.), the different aims and theoretical frameworks of both works (Martens' is a somewhat dated political intervention, Losurdo's a historico-philosophical polemic), and the fact that I, as you could have guessed, quite like Losurdo's writings.","created_utc":1534707042,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"DeLaProle","body":"Greece shouldn't have joined the EU in the first place, if it kept its own currency and didn't have monetary policy dictated by the EU it wouldn't even be in this mess, so in that sense the problem isn't *strictly* the existence of money. When it first joined the EU it was seen as an economic success, simply due to the fact that once you join economies into a monetary union money will flood from the banks of core, surplus areas to deficit areas. This money increased house prices, people took out loans for cars, etc. so there was a semblance of growth but its foundation was shaky and the debt was unsustainable. When the 2008 financial crisis hit Europe the cracks in this shaky foundation could not be patched over any longer. Greece was the weakest link. Instead of recognizing the game was over, the EU went into overdrive taking money from European taxpayers in order to give to the Greek government, so the Greek government could immediately give the money to European banks (primarily German\/French banks). This didn't make Greek debt any more sustainable, it just pushed losses onto the working class. Loan conditions actually made the debt *less* sustainable.   \n  \nSYRIZA (party of the coalition of the radical left) was elected to oppose this EU policy on Greece, and in order to punish the Greek people for voting in such a way the EU waged economic war on Greece which only heightened once the party put the next bailout the EU was trying to force on Greece to a national referendum. The EU was furious that such policies would be decided by democracy, and the ECB shut down Greek banks, and every television station was proclaiming apocalypse if people voted *No* to the bailout. But the people did vote No by 62%. In actuality the prime minister Tsipras, who was less of a radical leftist and more of a social democratic technocrat who enjoys the position of PM, only called the referendum because he, like everyone else, assumed it would fail, and that this failure would give him an easy out in order to surrender behind \"well we tried but we must listen to the people\". When the results of the referendum came in Tsipras surrendered anyway, and his finance minister resigned in protest.   \n  \nYou have heard Greece is \"exiting the bailout\" today (by the way this is the third bailout). What does this mean? It means the loan is up. Greece is still bankrupt and in greater debt than before and it will not be able to pay. How will it play out? All we know is it will not get better. How will it affect Greek fascist parties? It has already affected Greek fascist parties. Golden dawn went from 0.3% of the vote in 2009 to 7% in 2015, with 3 members in the European Parliament, and is currently polling around 10%. Thousands of people have left Greece, and it has been subjected to unprecedented austerity the likes of which immediately disprove libertarian bullshit about economics. If history is any lesson it will not end well, and a lot will depend on the left getting its act together while the political center continues to dissolve from the effects of its failures. \n \n  \n","created_utc":1534796421,"score":15,"subreddit":"communism"}

Poland's population probably was the most reactionary and anti-Soviet post-war (I think the turnout for that election was on the low side IIRC), which is why you saw things like the Kielce massacre which the Red Army had to stop, but I see no reason to believe that the count itself of the electorate that turned out was rigged.","created_utc":1534823295,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

Rather than oppression existing in a system of primary and secondary contradictions rooted in the real material relations of the capitalist mode of production, Butler and others revived idealism and made ideology primary. Capital is at best one of many performative acts within independent \"systems of power\" (the usage of the word power in this way is like the usage of political economy today to mean neither politics nor economics but IR logic games). How convenient that those with immense power would find a theory that vindicates them and makes them appear oppressed. The hypocrisy is the particular focus on sexual harassment (and therefore whether these \"queer\" professors can participate in it) which is currently being taken seriously, as the suit shows the kind of abuse of power that happened to include sexual harassment is the norm not just in academia but in the workplace as well and has never bothered any of these \"radicals\" nor is it currently being addressed. Though many of these professors also claim to be Marxists, and that should be ruthlessly criticized. \n\nMarxists should use the current moment of attention to sexual harassment to point to these larger power relations and show that sexual harassment is one of many oppressions the working class is forced to endure when it must sell its labor power under pain of starvation (actually one of its most fundamental ones and one close to the basic reproduction process). Women, rather than suffering some unique oppression outside of class, are in fact the vanguard and should be leading the struggle against capitalism through their elevared class consciousness as the result of more naked and obscene exploitation. In a sense, we need a metoo for everything, most especially exploitation. Proletarian feminism is both about how sexism and patriarchy are deeply rooted in capitalism and how capitalism perpetuates them to exploit women to a greater degree. It is not about isolating speech acts and ideologies as primary causes. Though I appreciate Zizek further exposing himself as a pig by arguing the opposite that this is no problem at all and that a \"Marxist\" professor should openly participate in sexism.","created_utc":1534975750,"score":13,"subreddit":"communism"}

Even if there weren't instances of directly funding and changing scripts to suit \"America's\" geopolitical interests abroad, Hollywood would still continue making the same garbage.

This model has been developed by Michael Commons and others since the 1980s.\n\n***\n\n**Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development**\n\nLawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development constitute an adaptation of a psychological theory originally conceived by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget.

Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment far beyond the ages studied earlier by Piaget, who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/communism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1534982840,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

The dossier on which the whole thing was based was held by some in top positions to be at least very suspect if not an outright fabrication even then. Then somehow magically (and here's where it does get murky) a top government weapons expert who had been critical of the dossier, Dr David Kelly, was found dead in a field near his home, supposedly suicide from a combination of copraxamol tablets and a slashed ulnar artery. This was a man who according to those who knew him had no reason to commit suicide and experts have argued about the fatality of a ulnar artery injury in formal investigations of the case. There was also little blood present at the scene, as would be expected in such a case, and there was confusion as to how many tablets he'd supposedly taken, and testing of the knife and pill packet he supposedly used bought up no fingerprints. He was also reported in the two days to have made a statement about 'dark actors playing their games' which has led many to believe that it could easily have been a government-ordered killing. \n\n  And what frustrates me even further, in any conflict, is that far too many ordinary people are so short-sighted that they fixate on the short-term gains whilst ignoring the major geopolitical ramifications such actions have on a longer term scale.

When the bourgeois state in California was happy to let black children go to school unfed, the Black Panthers didn\u2019t rally around democratic candidates, they became militant and fed the children themselves. In the 40s and 50s, socialists in New York saw people going without healthcare and instead of rallying behind democratic candidates, they built the IWO to provide healthcare directly. Both these groups took up our pressing revolutionary task: building dual power.\n\n&gt;Imagine if all those hours the DSA poured into electing Ocasio were instead used to feed the people of New York, to provide them with medical care, to ensure their needs were met. Imagine the masses seeing socialism not as a pipe dream we might achieve through electing more imperialists, but as a concrete movement which is currently meeting their needs?\n\nIt's weird that after all that, this is what the author thinks \"dual power\" means. Dual power means exactly what it sounds like: gaining that power which grows out of the barrel of a gun. The Bolsheviks showed that they were the only ones capable of defending the workers and the only ones capable of ending the war (or more accurately turning it into a revolutionary war). The revolution didn't happen because of some mail deliveries. This line is pure revisionism on the Panthers as well, they gained power because they were the only ones capable of defending the black nation from police violence and occupation. The \"survival pending revolution\" programs were at best secondary effects, their elevation to primary sources of dual power comes from the Elaine Brown and Bobby Seale revisionist viewpoint which has become incorporated into mainstream liberalism. Many Maoists have fallen into this trap as well, either becoming red charities or shitty NGOs with a radical veneer.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/lenin\/works\/1917\/apr\/09.htm\n\nDual power clearly refers to a revolutionary state within a state of the paris commune type, not the act of carving out socialistic spaces like occupy.","created_utc":1535088647,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

Nobody cares, I've presented information debunking the most common myths (October Revolution, Russian Civil War, GULAG, WW2, etc, etc), left those arguing without any escape except realising that they have no idea of what they are talking about, only to see them repeat the exact same thing over and over.\n\nMy recent posts in \/r\/europe about the vile and disgusting \"black ribbon\" initiative is born out of anger and in all honesty it's completely worthless and I try to avoid them, but sometimes I can't help and vent. It is not however after a sense of \"convincing\" anyone since when you scratch under the surface you start to see that people do not even have the most essentially knowledge about the topics they talk about and that there is no debating to be had. I mostly comment to make it apparent the obvious links between capitalism, liberalism and Nazism just to keep it out there, but apart from specific subs it's mostly worthless.\n\nThis internment camps will become part of the lore used in interviews, another factoid nobody can source, the difference being that those about the USSR are traceable to Nazi propaganda and this ones are a more original liberal creation. But do not expect that \"debunking\" this will make a iota of difference.\n\n\ned: another trait I see more and more is the complete arrogance in \"I will have to ask you for sources, I'm a Very Intelligent Man and will pretend that I am very academic since I took a CS course and that makes me part of the STEM elite even though I can't read anything longer than a man page or shitty SF\", I used to actually fall for this and spend minutes all the references, only to have as a reply \"lol you're wrong\".

{"author":"MkeSocialist","body":"I love board games. The mechanisms in monopoly are very dated \"roll and move.\" There are some modern board games with left wing themes. \n\nNew Angeles is a negotiation game set in a dystopian special economic zone in the US. Each player is a capitalist in a certain field of industy (media, construction, utilities, health care). They all have to work together to manage problems as they arise, and they do this by putting forward proposals that are voted upon by the group. You bribe one another and make backstabbing deals to get your proposal agreed upon. For instance, maybe there are strikes going on that are about to get out of control. The media magnate might put forward a proposal that would manipulate the press to demoralize the strike. It is the right thing to do by all accounts, because if the strikes get out of hand, the government might step in to regain order. If that happens, everyone loses. However, instead of going with that, the health care capitalist might pay off everyone else at the table to make a move that would benefit the construction capitalists proposal. Why? Because his contruction project is sketchy and it will make people in the neighborhood sick, thus opening up greater profits for the health care ceo in the long run. It is a brutal game. \n\nThere is also spirit island. This is a game about indigenous people fighting off waves and waves of european settlers. You awaken the powers of the native deities to destroy their cities and terrify them to the point in which they abandon their project. \n\nBloc by bloc is a anarchist themed game that takes place during a revolution. You loot stores, set up barricades, and take on the cops, as they swarm and surround you. \n\nAll excellent modern games with left wing themes.","created_utc":1535155603,"score":18,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"BashTheFash1312","body":"Feudalism was a contract between vassal and liege lord, in part meant to make large swathes of territory more manageable. \n\nA sovereign monarch would rule over his vassals in tiers of authority, usually meaning they would directly control dukes, who controlled counts, who controlled barons. Each level had a certain degree of autonomy over how they ruled their direct vassals, although ultimately they answered to the crown. This balance was precarious however, as vassals often revolted against their liege for various reasons.\n\nAnyway, all of these tiers were wealthy landowners, the barons of cities in particular referred to as burghers, a term which becomes important in Marxist philosophy when determining the origins of the modern definitive social classes.\n\nThe working class that toiled the lands of the lords were known as serfs, and they were essentially at the mercy of those above them.\n\nYou can see how the classes present in feudalism are quite similar to those in capitalism. As the absolute power of the monarchy was eroded over time, apparent in events like the signing of the Magna Carta, the landowning burghers, or bourgeoisie, became the predominant power in society, and continued to rule over their peasant serfs, the proletariat.\n\nThere are plenty of cases however of peasant rebellions, in which the serfs would rise up against their tyrannical lords. This is where the tools of the working class became symbols of rebellion, for example pitchforks, hammers, and sickles.\n\nRebellions like this, and of course the famous French Revolution clearly had a large influence on Marx's philosophy. \n\nHe saw how little had really changed throughout history, how it was all centered on the violent struggle between the same classes, and he believed the industrialization he was witnessing at the time would change things, highlighting the dichotomy between the upper class and the lower class, finally bringing the struggle to a head.","created_utc":1535161437,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"throwawayacctcommie","body":"At this point, it is becoming more and more obvious anti-imperialism.org is *ideologically* compromised, and can not be relied upon to produce content that isn't *backhandedly* a defense of imperialism.\n\nLet me start with the end first:\n\n&gt;Our responsibility, first and foremost, is to turn struggle inward, and to confront the threat of imperialist world war with revolutionary war.\n\nI am reminded of one time I went to a PLP rally, one of these yearly May Day rituals they do. The war in Syria was raging, and the US imperialists had just destroyed the Libyan government's ability to resist their terrorist Islamic thugs with a *months* long aerial bombardment campaign. In the rally, they had a *curious* slogan, very similar to this one. It was:\n\n\"Turn the imperialist war into class war!\"\n\nI naturally took the opportunity after their little march to ask them hard questions, and the PLP answered these questions like the labor aristocracy lackeys they turned themselves into years ago; Assad is a fascist! Yes, the PLP *actually* said this. This is how they imagine to turn the imperialist war in 'class' war! \"Turn the imperialist war into more profits for the labor aristocracy!\" would have been a more accurate slogan.\n\nIn the car ride back, I asked one of the passengers, in the *gentliest* way I could \"Why did you change the slogan?\" They seemed puzzled, and asked me what I meant. I said \"Well, Lenin said [turn the imperialist into **civil war**](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/lenin\/works\/1914\/sep\/00.htm). Why did you change it?\" He paused for what could only be a second or two, and then preceded to let out a noise I could only described as a *scream* cut off the moment he began it, as if something inside him told him not to it. He *knew* what I was thinking. Moreover, he *knew* I knew what he was thinking as well, so silence was better than this aging 80s radical trying to yell a correct line into my more youthful skull.\n\nThis situation is no different. This author of this piece, calling themselves \"Amber S.\" is no different. They alter Lenin's slogan because the very *idea* of transforming the imperialist war into *civil war* brings to their mind something terrifying, something they have been *conditioned* by years of \"American\" schooling to never *really* do; call into question \"American\" identity and all the *narratives* \"America\" tells about itself, both to those inside its borders and to the world at large. For the PLP, this extends as far as total abandonment of the Black Nation thesis; the Black Panthers were Black Fascists, just like Assad!\n\nIt is clear to me now, that the forces behind anti-imperialism.org are the same geriatric 'Maoists' from the 70s, clinging on to the little fiefdoms of \"Left\" activism they control on behalf of the Democratic Party apparatus. They are forced to inter the arena of anti-imperialist politics because the line struggle has been *acute* enough in this area to expose them for the frauds they are, and so they naturally do what they're best at; *phrase-mongering* to confuse anyone attracted to anti-imperialism. Their jobs is to *obfuscate* the meaning of the word, to render it meaningless; *everyone* and anything is an imperialist, except, of course, the little *cults* under the control of said geriatric radicals, and the people handing them money to continue to run these scam organizations.\n\nThe time will come where the *test* for *authenticity* is going to be a violent one. Organizations like RAIM will one day be flooded with young people, young people who are *tired* of arguing with old pieces of shit *who should be dead already*. They're going to ask themselves why they haven't started *violent* operations against the State (and not against other political opponents of said State labeled as \"fascists\"), and they're going to come to the conclusion that its because they're a part of it. And then they're gonna attack *you*.","created_utc":1535243060,"score":9,"subreddit":"communism"}

You'd only be able to do that by preventing them from chopping the wood down themselves, because if they could, there's no reason for them to hand over that 5h if they could just chop the wood down themselves and work the wood they chopped down.

{"author":"DoubleOil","body":"These studies are the same one that Turning Point: USSR tried to bandy about on their page as well, in their effort to denigrate China post-Mao - it's quite telling when the ultras and dogmatists resort to citing these sort of so-called \"studies\". Here's the thing, though - they're clearly motivated with agendas.  Let's take a look at some of the other studies that they helped co-author and see what agendas I might be referencing.\n\nFor example, one of the author's, when you follow the link to the NBER page listing their works, [Anton Cheremukhin](https:\/\/www.nber.org\/people\/anton_cheremukhin) has a clear anti-Stalin\/gains made by the USSR bent, not to even mention of the address given, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Here is a quote from his \"study\" titled, \"Was Stalin Necessary for Russia's Economic Development?\":\n\n\"...imply that Stalin's economic policies led to welfare loss of -24 percent of consumption in 1928-1940, but a +16 percent welfare gain after 1941. ... A representative consumer born at the start of Stalin's policies in 1928 experiences a reduction in welfare of -1 percent of consumption, a number that does not take into account additional costs of political repression during this time period.\"\n\nAnother author, Sergei Guriev, has on the NBER site a \"study\" they helped publish titled, [\"How Modern Dictators Survive: An Informational Theory of the New Authoritarianism\"](https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w21136).  From the introduction of the study, we can see right off the bat the inherent bourgeois ideology bias with the following sentences, the very first two of the so-called \"study\": \"How do dictators hold onto power?  The totalitarian tyrannies of Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, and others relied largely\u2014although not exclusively\u2014on mass terror and indoctrination.\"\n\nGoing even further, if we examine the front page of the linked \"study\" we're told:\n\n\"..any opinions, findings or recommendations expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of their colleagues, affiliated organizations, Banque de France, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the Federal Reserve System, or the National Bureau of Economic\"\n\nOf course it says that it doesn't reflect any of those organizations opinions, but I'm not so sure of that. Generally speaking, when these have to be included, it's likely that there are some of their opinions being reflected here.  \n\nOh, and about opinions.  Funny thing about the \"studies\" on nper:\n\n\"NBER working papers are circulated for discussion and comment purposes. They have not been peer-reviewed or been subject to the review by the NBER Board of Directors that accompanies official publications.\"\n","created_utc":1535291491,"score":19,"subreddit":"communism"}

Lets not forget that over night the Bolsheviks found themselves rewriting the thesis, probably irrationally, changing the script to a likely unrealistic \"Communism IS possible in one country!\", finding themselves a single leftist boat adrift on an ocean of capitalist animosity. \n\nLets not forget that merely 2 weeks after the successful October revolution which liberated the Russian people from the brutal rule of a 500 year dynastic monarchy, the White Armies comprising of forces from 14 different nations headed by Britain invaded Russia, and tried to destroy the revolution. Lets not forget the massive atrocities all over the country sides they committed, nor their funding of the most reactionary and rightist elements within the vanguard parties.  \n\nLets not forget that the violence and constant threat of violence, from invasion to nuclear war, never ceased from that point on, and made a unified Soviet military, and the consolidation, rather than planned decentralisation, of Soviet state power necessary. \n\nLets not forget the trade embargoes, economic sanctions, and imposed political isolationism, on the USSR, which was developmentally 200 years behind the capitalist powers. Lets not forget the CRIPPLING economic strangulation, such as the gold sanctions, which forced USSR to pay for desperately needed machines and technology toward industrialisation with agricultural products, that was a central causal factor in the Ukrainian famines. \n\nAnd within Russia, lets not forget the Tsarists, the powerful elites, the former property-owning bourgeois classes, the liberals, the collaborators with Western capitalist states, the traitors, saboteurs, infiltrators, right-wing subversives, all of whom bitter and vengeful, who would have destroyed the revolution if given half a chance, if the transitional state had let its guard down for half a second. Lets not forget that it was under such circumstances that the secret police, surveillance system, the gulags\\*, all of which comprise a repressive state apparatus, was absolutely necessary. (\\*The average stay in gulags was 7 years. The height of gulag population was proportionally less than the number of prisoners in US penal system)\n\n\"The revolution is a dying man, hanging on by a single thread\" \u2013 Vladimir Lenin (private correspondance, 1920)\n\nLets not forget that even with all of this, the Soviet Union defeated the nazis, rapidly developed, massively improved life for its citizens, pioneered space exploration, and 50 years later became a world power.\n\nLets not forget that these realities of being under constant siege externally, and facing constant sabotage internally, shaped the politics of not only the USSR, but all subsequent socialist nations, produced the kinds of leaders they did, and influenced the decisions made by them.  \n\n\"Do we want to abolish the state? Of course we do. But it can not be right now: too much imperialist threat from abroad and too much counter revolutionary elements at home\u201c \u2013 Mao Ze Dong. (1951)\n\nLets not forget that the repressive totalitarianisms of 20th century revolutionary states developed in such a context, from such historical processes, and can not be at all rationally attributed to the idea of communism itself.","created_utc":1535304862,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

The best answer I got is that you can actually find a lot of pornographic material (even written erotica is banned in China) on Reddit, as well as talk about other illicit activities like drugs. This is probably why more than anything China banned it. At least, no one could come up with any other narrative that makes sense. My wife jokes that they did it to keep me off Reddit!\n\nBut after going to \/r\/China, I kind of realized Reddit is basically a cesspool of anti-China sentiment. Even places that are supposed to be non-political about China just get bombarded with anti-China propaganda, most of it outlandish. I imagine this could also have played a part in it, but I don't know.\n\nIt has been obvious to me for a long time liberals (those in power, anyway) will freely play on racist sentiments when it suits their purposes. They generally do this for a 'conservative' audience; pick someone to their 'Left,' argue with them about non-'white' people in some way, and dog-whistle all the racism they can.

{"author":"ShadowPuppet91","body":"The ruling classes of feudalism and capitalism are qualitatively different in the sense that 1) they control different things, respectively land and industrial production, and 2) they were different people for the most part. Land was generally owned by the nobility, but industry by the bourgeoisie. Those classes (and others) existed side by side for a long time, but the bourgeoisie became ever more dominant. \n\nThe power did not transfer from the monarchy to the landowners, it transferred from the landowners (including the monarchs) to the owners of industry (the bourgeoisie). \n\nThe relations of production change because various productive activities became an ever greater part of the labour done in society.  In the case of cotton, farmers started weaving cotton at home to supplement their income. Later, workshops and factories were set up to produce cotton goods, which were staffed partl with full time employees, but also with many seasonal people from the countryside. And in a few centuries, the people working the land have reduced from over half the population to maybe 1 percent of the population.\n\nThis is a massive depvelopment with far more nuances and simultaneous developments, but in general people shifted FROM producing 1 for their own subsistence 2 for their lord and 3 a bit for a market for money, TO producing for the market for money completely.

Cockshott envisions people using TV's or smartphones to do fast voting on such issues.\n\nThe other is that we should make arming the proletariatt a priority, and make sure every worker has the means to defend themselves.

How the capitalist state can take literally anything and turn it into something bad when it comes to socialist countries. I'll make sure to edit it to this post when I get on a real computer. \n\nEDIT: \n\n \u201cIn the United States, for over a hundred years, the ruling interests tirelessly propagated anticommunism among the populace, until it became more like a religious orthodoxy than a political analysis. During the Cold War, the anti-communist ideological framework could transform any data about existing communist societies into hostile evidence. If the Soviets refused to negotiate a point, they were intransigent and belligerent; if they appeared willing to make concessions, this was but a skillful ploy to put us off our guard. By opposing arms limitations, they would have demonstrated their aggressive intent; but when in fact they supported most armament treaties, it was because they were mendacious and manipulative. If the churches in the USSR were empty, this demonstrated that religion was suppressed; but if the churches were full, this meant the people were rejecting the regime\u2019s atheistic ideology. If the workers went on strike (as happened on infrequent occasions), this was evidence of their alienation from the collectivist system; if they didn\u2019t go on strike, this was because they were intimidated and lacked freedom. A scarcity of consumer goods demonstrated the failure of the economic system; an improvement in consumer supplies meant only that the leaders were attempting to placate a restive population and so maintain a firmer hold over them. If communists in the United States played an important role struggling for the rights of workers, the poor, African-Americans, women, and others, this was only their guileful way of gathering support among disenfranchised groups and gaining power for themselves. How one gained power by fighting for the rights of powerless groups was never explained. What we are dealing with is a non falsifiable orthodoxy, so assiduously marketed by the ruling interests that it affected people across the entire political spectrum.\u201d (Left Anticommunism: the unkindest cut, Michael Parenti, 2015) ","created_utc":1535394512,"score":69,"subreddit":"communism"}

This quickly becomes a trap, because socialism cannot survive having significant amounts of labour &amp; resources allocated for unproductive tasks , for extended periods of time, the imperialist capitalists however can (a least for longer) because they can subsidize from imperial loot.\n\nAs far as war goes, remember that soldiers are drawn from the working class, that's not a good deal you want war to mean that capitalists lives are at risk rather than working class people lives. \n\nSo a better countermeasure against imperialist aggression, is targeted action against capitalists-interest groups that would benefit from attacking you. You could have secrete intelligence operations that target news-organizations that disseminate pro-war propaganda, you could sabotage business sectors who support war efforts against you, you could assassinate shareholders &amp; stocks-owners of companies that benefit from wars etc. If you don't have intelligence assets, you could still aim to drastically reduce your military expenses by building \"class-sensitive weapons\" for example instead of loading your icbm with a nuclear war-head you load it with a lot's of precision-guided conventional sub-munitions, and target the places that the pro-war capitalists tend to go. (their homes, company-headquarters, their recreational activity spaces, their bunkers, private jets, yachts, private islands,...) as well as their systems that store property claims and financial transactional systems (no wars without bankers)\n\nIn the theoretical sense you move from statistical deterrence by scale, to a data driven targeted deterrence. You remove your threat against proles living in capitalist countries and make sure this is known, so that you do not serve as unifying enemy for class solidarity between workers and capitalists. You also increase personal insecurity for pro war capitalists, but decrease overall insecurity by reducing large scale war potential. Further more you do not engage in traditional war propaganda but style it like inverted sponsorship-advertizements: \"this murder campaign is brought to you by *list of names,brands,...* \"\n\nTLDR: if rich people had to die in wars, there wouldn't be any: taken as a howto manual for peace.\n","created_utc":1535417298,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

Spying has its place, but at the moment we don't really have the movement to support that.

Publicly available stuff is just terrible.). That makes American workers relatively wealthier, but it does not mean they are not proletarian.  Yes, Americans are often capable of purchasing more than workers in colonies, but consumption patterns are a bad method for judging productive class position.  There are a couple of reasons for this - commodities are often sold at higher margins in the imperial center and client states than in subordinated nations, or in the nation they were produced in (especially prc).  You cant harvest the same rate of super profits from a less wealthy prole market but you can still make a profit at scale.  One\u2019s ability to purchase the commodities imported from the peripheries does not change one\u2019s relation to capital.  It possibly effects a person\u2019s politics regarding imperialism - but then so does having your job moved to Guangzhou.  The higher wages in the imperial center are a vestige of class conflict here that is rapidly disappearing.  As the empire declines and PRC and other challengers rise, this stuff will begin to even out.\n\nOf course capitalists want higher rates of exploitation which they can achieve by moving some production overseas, but they never employ at a loss.  If the american public isnt proletarian then why do they have jobs at all?  If they dont create value then what good are they?\n\nThe most exploited \u201cmigrant\u201d field workers might earn $4...most do much better.  $10 is probably the average.

Publicly available stuff is just terrible.).\n\nActually, if you make $32,400 a year, you make more than 99% of the people on the planet. According to Wikipedia data on US income, only about 33.63% of 'American' households even make below $35,000 a year, and the overwhelmingly majority of these are single income households.\n\nSo right off the bat, we can see 66.37% of 'Americans' make more money than 99% of the people on the entire planet.\n\nIf you make $13,745 a year, that means you generate more income than 90% of the people on the entire planet. This means your typical full-time fast-food worker in 'America' makes more money than 90% of the people on the planet.\n\nOnce you start studying this question in a serious way, it is obvious why First-Worlders don't want anything to do with 'socialism.' Imperialism pays absolutely enormous wages, and yields absolutely enormous benefits, far, far beyond what 'socialism' could ever provide the parasites in the First-World.\n\nSource: www.globalrichlist.com\n\n&gt;That makes American workers relatively wealthier, but it does not mean they are not proletarian. \n\nFirst-World \"Leftists\" think anyone paid a wage is by *definition* a proletarian. So corporate managers making $300,000 a year are proletarians. So are millionaire basketball players and Hollywood celebrities.\n\n&gt;Yes, Americans are often capable of purchasing more than workers in colonies, but consumption patterns are a bad method for judging productive class position.\n\nThe children of a billionaire capitalist don't own anything either, but only First-World \"Leftists\" would call them proles.\n\n&gt;There are a couple of reasons for this - commodities are often sold at higher margins in the imperial center and client states than in subordinated nations, or in the nation they were produced in (especially prc).\n\nThis isn't actually true. An iphone in China is just as expensive as it is in \"America.\" Some items that aren't destined for export are cheaper, but otherwise prices aren't much different.\n\n&gt;You cant harvest the same rate of super profits from a less wealthy prole market but you can still make a profit at scale.\n\nWhile this phenomenon does happen (not often), it's probably a result of shipping costs more than scale.\n\n&gt;One\u2019s ability to purchase the commodities imported from the peripheries does not change one\u2019s relation to capital.\n\nYou would call the children of a billionaire proles because they don't own anything, even though they freely consume surplus value created by others.\n\n&gt;Of course capitalists want higher rates of exploitation which they can achieve by moving some production overseas, but they never employ at a loss.\n\nThis actually isn't true at all. Capitalists routinely hire people who themselves produce no value. Anyone who has ever worked a job where people constantly find ways to slack off knows this. What *is* important is that, of the total people hired, wages and other costs do not exceed the amount of money coming in.\n\nA firm could hire 100 workers in Bangledesh to build cellphone parts for $2 a day, and hire 10 'workers' in the US to assemble the parts together for $20 an hour. It's quite trivial to construct a scenario to show mathematically that if you made all wages equal and eliminated the capitalist's profit, the wages of the US 'workers' would actually go *down*.\n\n&gt;If the american public isnt proletarian then why do they have jobs at all? If they dont create value then what good are they?\n\nThere is simply no way to *realize* the profit without them. Why does a capitalist hire a cashier, who produces no value? Because with them, the *realization of profit* is impossible.\n\n&gt;The most exploited \u201cmigrant\u201d field workers might earn $4...most do much better.\n\nAgain, *even the hardest working and lowest paid* people inside \"America's\" borders aren't exploited.\n\n&gt;Sorry, but you are just wrong about slaves and white workers not competing with them or wanting to work. \n\nYou should take your argument up with Karl Marx. To quote him:\n\n&gt;\u201cIf,\u201d says Wakefield, \u201call members of the society are supposed to possess equal portions of capital... no man would have a motive for accumulating more capital than he could use with his own hands. This is to some extent the case in new American settlements, where a passion for owning land prevents the existence of a class of labourers for hire.\u201d [6] So long, therefore, as the labourer can accumulate for himself \u2014 and this he can do so long as he remains possessor of his means of production \u2014 capitalist accumulation and the capitalistic mode of production are impossible...\n\n&gt;\u201cIn the Northern States of the American Union; it may be doubted whether so many as a tenth of the people would fall under the description of hired labourers.... In England... the labouring class compose the bulk of the people.\u201d\n\nHere Marx quotes Wakefield as saying the dynamic that prevents the proper functioning of capitalism is the amount of cheap land available. The Europeans who came to America were seeking cheap land, because they rightfully saw cheap land as the golden-ticket to their prosperity and escape from the dominion of capitalists. When the capitalist class can't control who uses the land, they can't control anything. This is why hordes and hordes of different European ethnicities came to America in the first place.\n\nThis is also why slavery was necessary.\n\n&gt;Nay, the impulse to self-expropriation on the part of labouring humanity for the glory of capital, exists so little that slavery, according to Wakefield himself, is the sole natural basis of Colonial wealth. His systematic colonization is a mere pis aller, since he unfortunately has to do with free men, not with slaves. \u201cThe first Spanish settlers in Saint Domingo did not obtain labourers from Spain. But, without labourers, their capital must have perished, or at least, must soon have been diminished to that small amount which each individual could employ with his own hands. This has actually occurred in the last Colony founded by England \u2014 the Swan River Settlement \u2014 where a great mass of capital, of seeds, implements, and cattle, has perished for want of labourers to use it, and where no settler has preserved much more capital than he can employ with his own hands.\u201d\n\nHere we see the capitalists bemoaning the uselessness of Euro-Settlers in advancing their economic interests. Without the ability to control the use of the land, they could not extract any substantial amount of profit from the Euro-Settler masses. Hence the need for African slavery as the sole basis for Colonial wealth.\n\nMarx drives it home:\n\n&gt;We have seen that the expropriation of the mass of the people from the soil forms the basis of the capitalist mode of production. The essence of a free colony, on the contrary, consists in this \u2014 that the bulk of the soil is still public property, and every settler on it therefore can turn part of it into his private property and individual means of production, without hindering the later settlers in the same operation.[10] This is the secret both of the prosperity of the colonies and of their inveterate vice \u2014 opposition to the establishment of capital. \u201cWhere land is very cheap and all men are free, where every one who so pleases can easily obtain a piece of land for himself, not only is labour very dear, as respects the labourer\u2019s share of the produce, but the difficulty is to obtain combined labour at any price.\u201d\n\n-------\n&gt;Im pretty sure that if aliens forced \u201cequality\u201d global wages would rise above the current US median. Most wealth is eaten by the bourgeoisie and their nonsense.\n\nYou could shoot every capitalist in the world and redistribute their wealth to the poorest people, and it wouldn't change much of anything.","created_utc":1535436954,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

I notice that you also have taken to obscuring phrases with false comparisons, because \"confrontation\" and \"transformation\" are words with two completely different meanings. We don't mean to transform their wars into anything, but to confront their wars with ones of our own. Also, it is worth noting that the whole of this article is arguing that we shouldn't be confused by the fact that other imperialist powers exist in figuring out who our primary enemy is, it is always the united $tates, until we achieve victory over it, it will always be that.\n\nNevertheless, let's take a walk backward into a few other pieces written on this topic:\n\n\"We must adopt the initial and correct Comintern line, informed by the experience of the communist movement in the first world war: oppose imperialist provocations, support revolutionary defeatism and develop the communist movement.\" (source: https:\/\/anti-imperialism.org\/2018\/05\/09\/world-war-ii-the-last-just-war\/)\n\n\"The role of revolutionaries and anti-imperialists in the united $tates must be the obstruction of amerikan war efforts and the construction of domestic revolutionary power. Our primary tasks are to solidify the relationship between our movements and those of the whole world, quicken the demise of amerikan imperialism, and outmaneuver both neoliberals the far-right in the construction of alternatives post-collapse.\" (source: https:\/\/anti-imperialism.org\/2017\/12\/19\/a-note-on-trumps-national-security-strategy\/)\n\n\"So far our nominal \u201csupport\u201d has done little to achieve peace in Syria or disarm the imperialists, and despite all that could be done the scope of what has been done is still small. We must change this. The anti-war movement remains in shambles and continues to dissolve, fewer and fewer actions take place despite greater and greater escalation, more and more conflicts. It is clear there is a great deal of ground to make up. So let\u2019s act accordingly.\" (Source: https:\/\/anti-imperialism.org\/2018\/04\/15\/our-responsibility-to-syria-and-the-third-world\/)\n\n\"We cannot allow the obscurantists of the left-wing movement to continue abstracting our role in the various wars currently being waged by the amerikan imperialists. We do not demand an end to the war because we support a Taliban government, but because we have a duty to resist our own imperialist government and its crimes internationally. We must reassert our own agency in this struggle, and begin actually rebuilding the anti-imperialist movement, and if the Afghan resistance calls for peace, then we should support that call with our own.\" (Source: https:\/\/anti-imperialism.org\/2018\/02\/16\/afghanistans-plea-for-peace\/)\n\nReally, it appears you are arguing against us on the basis of what you want us to be saying. I had thought that perhaps you were interested in genuine struggle and grappling seriously with these questions, rather than just running down a list of names to call us. You are grasping at straws, trying to somehow pigeon-hole a series of false-associations that allow you to make baseless assumptions about both RAIM and Anti-Imperialism.org. First of all, you make no real genuine logical connection between the use of \"revolutionary war\" in the article in place of \"civil war\" (an unconscious substitution of synonyms, at worst) and the implication that we somehow believe, like the PLP, that Assad or the Black Panthers are Fascists. In fact, you have framed the entirety of you argument as that the perceived similarity (which in itself is a reach) between one line in this article and a slogan you heard at a PLP rally some years ago, implying that RAIM is now a mirror image of the PLP, crusty pseudo-maoists and all. Spoken plainly, this argument makes no sense, and demonstrates a profound ignorance of RAIM and its positions.\n\nIt is also interesting that you talk of \"cults\" while you, in other replies, have stated specifically that it is the cult model that we must pursue. That we should take advantage of those who would likely fall victim to cults, and weaponize them to do illegal things for the anti-imperialist movement. Naturally, illegal and legal work, work open and in secret, are all elements of real militant communist organizing, but why is it that this cult-like behavior you describe is both acceptable and inexcusable at the same time? Secondly, who are you that we have to prove our \"authenticity\" with not only apparently a list of our members and their birthdays, as well as a list of illegal and violent acts that would satisfy you to think we are \"doing our part\"? So far my response to you has been in good faith, with the intention of actually continuing and creating discussion, but your replies have been nothing short of unprincipled posturing. Simply put, given that this is the internet, neither you or I can be sure of who the other person truly is, and therefore these unspoken calls to \"prove it\" should be met with suspicion and attempts to flex our own experience and \"stats\" should be considered equally baseless and suspicious. We can deal with ideas here, and that should be our focus, and they should be dealt with honestly.

{"author":"throwawayacctcommie","body":"I think I am going to make this my last comment on Reddit (at least for a long awhile). Real life is demanding more and more of my time, and it has been evident to me, for a long time now, that I am wasting my precious time, time that I will *never* get back, discussing *anything* with First-Worlders, whether or not they consider themselves anti-imperialists.\n\nI *seethe* with rage at how much of my life I have wasted on the \"American\" anti-war movement. I don't think it will ever stop, even after living outside of \"America\" for years now. In the back of mind, I often wonder just how much the \"Left\" in \"America\" is in on the *fraud*. Was *I* the only one who didn't know any better? Surely not, but how do you figure out *who* was in on it? How do I get a message out to other young people not to *waste their lives* on this shit?\n\nAt least that's what I tell myself, to somehow continue on, trying to post on every \"Left\" space online in the English language, to get the word out, to stop other young people from wasting their youth on this *garbage* as well. But when I think back on it, I don't really know how many people were serious anymore. Perhaps they knew something I didn't, perhaps someone came to them and asked them a few simple questions that would allow them to come to their own conclusions about what \"American\" \"Leftism\" *really* is. But then why bother getting involved in anti-war activism at all? Well, I guess I did have to do a *bunch of other shit* just to be able to coerce people into coming to those stupid and ridiculous marches organized by ANSWER.\n\nAnyway, to actually address what Dritteweltistin is saying, we need to begin by looking at the title of this little essay. Recall it is:\n\n&gt;Do Not be Distracted by Rising Imperialists, the U.$. is Still the Enemy!\n\nThe question people should ask themselves is *who the fuck are they talking to*? Who the hell is the *imagined audience* they are oh-so politely asking not to become distracted by \"Russian imperialism\" and \"Chinese social-imperialism?\"\n\nI'll tell you who. It is Democrats. It is liberals. It is people who call themselves Marxists. And it *definitely* is people who call themselves Maoists.\n\nIt certainly isn't *me*. I've *long* come to the conclusion that *anyone* talking about \"Russian imperialism\" or \"Chinese imperialism\" in \"Left\" spaces in the English-language is nothing but a degenerate parasite, a liberal who thinks Marxism is such a *hollow* ideology that they can put on the ideology like they put on a pair of socks, and spew the most outlandish garbage imaginable, with *no questions asked*.\n\nPeople even remotely sympathetic to what I am arguing should ask themselves this question: Why is it *acceptable* in *every* \"Left\" space in the English language to be able to openly say \"Russia\/China is an imperialist country,\" but there are a hole bunch of issues that only \"American\" liberals care about, that if you disagree with them on, even in the most *polite* way possible, will get you instantly banned?\n\nIt's because *they* control nearly *all* discourse in the English language \"Left\" spaces. *They* get to define what is *acceptable* to say and not to say. Hating the DPRK, saying any country in the world is imperialist, openly advocating supporting the Democratic Party, etc, etc, is fine. But step off script when it comes to issues that degenerate First-World slime liberals *actually* care about, and watch yourself get instantly banned, no questions asked.\n\nAnd it is *these people* RAIM is writing for. RAIM imagines itself to be *leading* these people into anti-imperialist politics. And yes, whether they admit it or not, these people are all self-described \"Maoists.\" That is because \"Maoists\" online are the absolute *worst* perpetrators of this nonsense.\n\nNonsense, I might add, RAIM has clearly shown now they *agree* with. RAIM has thrown out the Third-Worldist political economy, for unity with liberals masquerading as \"Maoists,\" who they imagine they can oh-so gently push into anti-imperialist positions.\n\nThese are people who think \"America\" consists of 99% exploited proletarians, possibly minus the Euro-\"American\" portion of the population. Where is the Third-Worldist political economy? Why are they not arguing with these people about surplus-value and imperialism?\n\nTo say Russia or China (or *any* country) is imperialist, it should *now* mean that Russia\/China is *majority exploiter*. Any other *definition* must be *rejected*, because it is a *rejection* of Third-Worldist political economy. If you are to believe First-World \"Marxists,\" even ones who take imperialism fairly seriously, *all* of their analytical assumptions would imply imperialism is a *minor* economic phenomenon having no serious impact on the world at all. If 99% of the population inside the borders of that thing called \"America\" are exploited proletarians, if the majority of the profit generated by \"American\" capitalists comes from the exploitation of domestic workers, then *imperialism is nothing*.\n\nThis is a fairly straightforward *logical* conclusion of First-Worldism, and *has* already been pointed out by the literature we read. Do I need to go run and find where Zak Cope says it in *Divided World Divided Class*? I *shoudn't*. Hell, even our opponents have basically pointed this out, and said as much. Do I need to go digging around and rereading Charles Post's garbage apologia for parasitism? I *shouldn't* have to. I *shouldn't* have to tell you these things, which should be so obvious to people who form their political views on the basis of Third-Worldist political economy.\n\nBut here you are, Dritteweltistin, agreeing with the *enemy*. Is Russia majority exploiter? Are the Russians masses consuming surplus value created outside their country? Are the Chinese? It doesn't matter, because you gotta lead those other \"Marxists\" who say Russia is imperialist, right? Gotta win them over.\n\nMaybe RAIM members have an internal dialogue with these people. The lawyer inside your mind is a \"Maoist\" that thinks 99% of the people in North America are exploited proletarians. You just need a good argument to win them over, to show them the light.\n\nWhat you need to do is *shoot* this internal lawyer, not argue with it. The time for *arguing* with these people is over. The *math* is fairly clear here, and First-Worldists have no coherent responses to it. Their views don't fit reality, but they *persist* anyway. *They* are the enemy. Why can't you see it, Dritteweltistin? What is preventing you from realizing that *these people* are the ones we're gonna have to *shoot* one day?\n\nI myself wonder if I am wasting my time on *you* in a similar fashion. My sincerometer (to borrow a phrase from Lenin) clearly points towards to the **LIAR** indicator when pointed in their direction, but seems to be malfunctioning when pointed at *you*. I thought I had *tuned* it fairly well over the years, but maybe not enough.\n\nI will you tell you this, Dritteweltistin. I don't *ever* plan on coming back to \"America,\" but if I ever do, I got a lot of *scores* to settle with the people this article was written for. You want to lead them around the nose, I want to them to *die*. Would you feel bad if every person in the RCP mysteriously went missing? How much of MIM did you *really* read?\n\nPerhaps all this talk is too *early*. Perhaps there are no other people like me to even find inside the borders of \"America.\" Perhaps they have been *closed off* ideologically from ever joining a self-described communist organization. I don't fault RAIM for not being a violent organization *right now*. I fault RAIM for writing articles for *the enemy* and throwing Third-Worldist political economy in the toilet when it suits them.\n\nIf you want to throw Third-Worldist political economy and ideology in the toilet, why do so for *absolutely worthless trash people*? If you're trying to lead people around by the nose you don't *ideologically* even agree with, why even bother with liberals who wear a \"Maoist\" costume?\n\nIf you're already willing to do that (and this is *assuming* you're genuine, and not just a liar *pretending* to support Third-Wordlist political economy), *why not* put on a different costume yourself, and preach a message to an audience *already* prone to anti-government violence? A liberal wearing a \"Maoist\" costume is gutter trash that will *never* do anything useful for you. Why bother wasting any time recruiting them?\n\nI think I've said all I wanted to say. While I haven't responded directly to Dritteweltistin's remarks about civil war and cults, I think my original comments stand on their own. I'm going to get off and stay off Reddit for awhile. Real life is demanding my attention, and I have to stop wasting my precious time on people who aren't going to be doing anything to actually *combat* US imperialism.","created_utc":1535460438,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

The central point of contention with the org I\u2019m in is between those who believe that what was once the proletariat in the United States (and much of the west in general) is now in a sense a labor aristocracy that siphons resources and wealth from the rest of the world and in turn sells the products of the global proletariat\u2019s labor to one another for the benefit of the bourgeoise, and those who maintain that being a member of the proletariat purely has to do with one\u2019s relationship to the means of production, over which the proletariat has no control in a capitalist economy. I believe there are compelling arguments to both sides, though of course the former argument is essentially a more modernized version of the third worldist perspective. \n\nA more nitpicky point within that debate is concerned with whether you have to be involved in producing something to be a member of the proletariat, as people who merely sell products have occupations that are wholly reliant upon the global proletariat being exploited as they are, making them at least a somewhat separate segment of the working class in modern times. An economy built upon retail and the financial sector over production (like the US\u2019s) only seems possible with this shift in the relationship between different segments of the global working class. The idea of potentially splitting the proletariat into two groups in order to account for the material conditions of capitalism in the 21st century may be a worthy topic for modern Marxists to delve into and analyze the feasibility of, as conditions have changed dramatically since the times of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Mao, etc. ","created_utc":1535487321,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

We could modify the famous quote to reflect this:\n\n&gt;Men make their own stories, but they do not make them as they please; they do not make them under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already, given and transmitted from the past. \n\nYour imaginary worlds are ideological representations of your place among the fetishism of commodities (the difference between fantasy and science fiction is that the latter delves into the production process that the former disguises through fetishism). Historical materialism therefore is applicable to stories but not in the way you wish, since you wish to disguise the historical materiality of fiction and your own consciousness. This is not merely a question of philosophy. Any world you could \"invent\" would be infinitely poorer than the world as it actually exists and will, through no conscious decision of your own, come to reflect the small slice of the world that is your particular class position between capitalist individualism on the market and capitalist alienation in abstract labor.

Socialism is when the workers take control of the means of production collectively (most often forcefully from the owners) and rule themselves.  If you\u2019re a capital owner you love fascism when liberalism fails.  If you\u2019re a worker, then fuck the owners.  They want to work you to your grave for profit.

Private owners withhold the means of production from the workers who then must sell their labor for less than the value that labor creates.  The private owners then sell that embodied labor (the product) back to the workers whom they paid less than the cost to purchase it.  As capitalists need capitalism to continue to exist to maintain their power over us, they squeeze the working class for more and more value per unit of labor.  To achieve this, one tool is maintaining a surplus army of labor.  Ie unemployment.  In real terms, they do this through monetary policy at the Fed.  Thus some remain impoverished to provide cheap labor and drive down wages of other workers to provide cheap goods to higher paid workers and the bourgeoisie.\n\nSocialism allows the means of production to be run by the workers themselves and to keep the fruits of their labor and determine how to\norganize themselves and to what end.

But I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and actually give you a thoughtful answer.\n\nFirst, not all kinds of Marxism are the same-- it's an extremely broad umbrella of traditions and if you actually want to have a realistic, nuanced view based on knowledge of the issue and not just a gut rejection based in ignorance then you have to look into what different kinds of Marxists actually believe. I tend to agree with you about Leninism, Stalinism, and some of the other vanguardist traditions that they have been shown not to be viable, but with different rationale than yours. But the authoritarian branch that you are identifying as representative of all of Marxism is only *half* of Marxism. There is also a libertarian Marxist branch that includes a bunch of ideologies-- council communism, autonomism, Marxism-de Leonism, and some of the more contemporary libertarian Marxists (like Yanis Varoufakis or Richard Wolff) who take a more democracy-focused approach don't really have a more specific label than an unqualified \"libertarian Marxism.\" \n\nEven within libertarian Marxism, these traditions have significant differences and their own histories, and likewise with the authoritarian traditions. As I said, I am strongly opposed to the authoritarian traditions and think that you're right that they have failed historically, but as someone who cares about reality and truth, I do acknowledge that Stalinists are very different from Trotskyists are very different from Maoists-- you know? Marx himself was very different from any of these vanguardist traditions, because vanguardism was a concept introduced later by Lenin (hence the fact that it's a common thread among these authoritarian traditions that all come out of Leninism). Marx himself once remarked \"I am not a Marxist\" because it was clear very quickly that people were taking his body of work (which is mostly a methodologically materialist immanent analysis and critique of capitalism, not a detailed political programme or a prophecy of what would certainly come to pass in the future) in directions that he did not agree with. \n\nSo that's the first thing. If you genuinely want to understand *why* people on the left believe what they do, then you need to understand (a) that they don't all believe even remotely the same thing, (b) that there are different reasons to have different specific beliefs (just like if you're a capitalist there are different reasons to be a Keynesian versus an Austrian versus a neoclassicist versus a social democrat, and all of those ideologies are different in seriously meaningful ways). We need to look at the left in sufficient detail if we want to understand it. I can't write a whole book about left-wing ideology here, but I'll lay out a couple of basics and then I can answer questions if you have them.\n\nSocialists, Marxists, communists, and anarchists are what I'd call the major categories of tendencies on the left. Socialism is the most broad-- it just means that you advocate for the transition from capitalism (a system in which there are two classes-- a minority who privately own the means of production and a majority who don't have any capital, so they have to rent the one thing they do have, their labor, to survive) to socialism, which is an economic system in which the class divide is eliminated, so there is only one universal class, and they are all equal worker-owners (authoritarians\/statist Marxists think that public state ownership counts as socialism, because Marx's definition of socialism was that it would be a transitional phase between capitalism and communism, but most socialists, especially libertarian-leaning socialists, believe that workers should run production directly, self-managing their workplaces).  \n\nTo keep this short, Marxists are people whose view of capitalism, society, and history is informed by Marx's theories-- theories such as that the foundational social relations that define capitalism are exploitative, that labor is the (or at least a primary) source of value... There are many examples (he wrote a lot), but one of the most important Marxist concepts that I would argue is maybe THE central feature of his philosophy is his theory of historical development (historical materialism). Essentially he argued that the degree of development of the forces of production (how much productive capacity your level of technological and organizational abilities provides a society) was the primary factor that determined *how a society was organized* at a certain time. He uses this theory to quite convincingly explain the historical process that brought us from pretty economically equal conditions in tribal\/hunter-gatherer societies (because when you have no technology and every person can only really produce enough to keep themselves alive you can't economically exploit them) to slave societies, to feudalism, to capitalism, and he uses this axiom to argue that socialism (the dissolution of the class divide) is the rational next step to take after capitalism had developed the forces of production enough for it to be possible, and that communism was the rational and most desirable final destination-- the \"end of history\" (a term which, in a show of a lack of self-awareness, neoliberals have kind of hijacked). And communism is just a society which is not only classless (socialist), but also is stateless, and goods no longer have to be distributed by market exchange or with currency). I think there's a strong case to make for this and I can explain in detail but I'm trying to cover a lot here. Anarchists also want a stateless society (with a participatory form of democracy) and they are also at least libertarian socialists, but anarchocommunists are (libertarian) communists. Within each of these (socialism, Marxism, communism, and anarchism) there are a lot of traditions, some major, some obscure, and if you don't differentiate and understand the differences then you can't really grasp the history of their development, or what they believe, or why. \n","created_utc":1535619240,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"TheTranscendentOther","body":"In very short, most Marxists are Marxists because even if some of the specifics were mistaken (he lived in the 19th century so he couldn't have foreseen a lot of phenomena occurring today) they believe that Marx's theories of history, his analysis of capitalism are correct or are at least the best theories that have been put forward, and that the economic and sociological lenses that Marxian analysis offers are useful, powerful tools for us to understand the world better. Marxists are usually communists, because communism is the rational end-point if you agree with his theory of historical development, but many socialists and anarchists find Marx's theories and Marxian analysis even if they don't identify with Marxism (partly because of the historical baggage you mentioned and partly because Marx was more on-board with utilizing the state than anarchists). \n\nThe second important point I want to make is that your question includes an assumption that I strongly take issue with. That is, this idea that communism has murdered tens of millions of people and that this is somehow evidence that capitalism is good and that you'd have to be insane to support communism.\n\nThe fact is, this is just a propagandistic talking point that you can't think too hard about or it falls to pieces. I mean, think critically about this. How are they arriving at that number? The estimates given vary extremely dramatically (by 60, 70 million people) depending on whether the estimater wants communism to look literally evil or not. It's able to vary so much because there is no way to actually measure how many people die *because of a mode of production* or even a political-economic ideology. I mean, they're counting all kinds of deaths that are the results of a complex multifaceted set of factors. For instance, people who died because of famines. Do we KNOW how many famines in the Soviet Union were caused BY the Soviet system? No, we can't know. Any famine could have occurred under the Czar if the revolution hadn't happened-- people die from famines in the developing world regardless of economic system. And much more importantly, if someone dies from a famine or disease or something like that, at what age of death do they begin to count as a victim or communism? 30? 40? 50? What if they're 90 years old but die of starvation? What if they're 90 and die during the famine, but it was probably from natural causes? None of the right-wingers who cite these fabricated statistics are going through death by death and making these distinctions. I don't know if they literally just count everyone who ever dies while living in a socialist country, or if they count everyone who happens to die during a famine, or everyone under 50 who dies? What about people who are killed because of crime that is linked to poverty that you blame on the system of communism?... Because they CERTAINLY are not counting only people who are intentionally killed by \"communist\" regimes-- if you aren't counting a ton of debatable, ambiguous grey-area deaths caused by material conditions that they simply reduce to being \"communism's fault\" then the number would be muuuch smaller.  They don't give you the information about methodology, because if you actually think for a second about how you'd go about measuring this you realize that it is impossible to do objectively-- the number depends completely on judgement calls that person fabricating the statistic decides. And I guarantee you, 99% of the people saying \"90 million ppl died bcuz communism!\" don't know either. They just heard some right-winger say it and were like \"OH MY GOD! HOW CAN ANYONE SUPPORT THAT?\"","created_utc":1535622878,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"TheTranscendentOther","body":"Now, lets look at things from the opposite direction. Because the argument is \"communism killed x tens of millions of people, so capitalism is better,\" and the implicit assumption embedded in that is that capitalism either *doesn't* cause deaths, or hasn't caused anywhere near as many deaths. But that just isn't true. There have been single countries (like India) where we've had maybe 50, 60 million people die under capitalism from deprivation, or poverty, or malnutrition, or exposure because they were homeless, or because of a lack of worker safety regulations, or police crackdowns on striking workers on behalf of capital... But there are LOTS of these countries-- pretty much the whole of the developing\/third world exists in a condition where there is a tiny capitalist class extracting immense wealth while most of the population lives in tin shacks on the street and has to work unbelievable hours for a few dollars a day that cannot possibly sustain them. And then there are the imperial wars that governments controlled by capitalists conduct in order to gain access to markets, resources, etc..  And then there are economic actions that capitalist governments undertake against other nations (think of the US sanctions on Iraq in the 90s that are estimated to have killed about 500,000 children). And then there are all the (often US supported) capitalist countries in Latin America and South East Asia that have utilized actual death squads to \"socially cleanse\" their nation of the poor-- Coca-Cola, United Fruit Company, and Chiquita Banana are all corporations who have financed financed paramilitary groups or dictatorships which ran such death squads in order to defend their business interests, including groups which Coca Cola actually used to murder union organizers from their own factory. Milton Friedman was a big supporter of Pinochet, so don't assume that the right-wing libertarians have clean hands either. Capitalists of all strips participate in and support state violence on appalling scales. \n\nMy point is, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't think it was fair to include those (because that's several 100 million deaths attributed to capitalism), but I think that if it was communists committing the same actions, you wouldn't hesitate to count them. You might say \"But these are communist\/Marxist governments! Capitalism is an economic ideology, not a political one.\" But Marxism and communism are economic ideologies too. They are simply embodied as ideals in some states, because economics is ultimately inextricably linked to politics, and it works the same in capitalism. If you have a capitalist economy, it hasn't become something else because the state is upholding private property as the economic paradigm. The police act on behalf of the capitalist class to defend their ownership of the means of production (yes, capitalism depends on state violence-- I know it's shocking if you're a libertarian), just like in a socialist state the police would act on behalf of the *working class* to defend *their* ownership of the means of production if some capitalist tried to start monopolizing more than their share. \n\nSo am I saying that capitalism has caused hundreds of millions of deaths more than communism? No. I mean, if you really want to play that game I do think that the kinds of deaths I listed above do probably outnumber even the highest estimates of deaths caused by communism\/Marxism. But my point is that *there is no rigorous way to make meaningful estimates of how many deaths are the fault of an economic system*. You can pick and choose any number you want depending on what you decide counts, so you can make any system sound wonderful or hellish. Many of the untimely deaths that occurred under Marxist states were because of famines that could've occurred without Marxism, many of the deaths would have occurred regardless because Russia was a poor, developing, largely agricultural nation at the time. And listen-- I'm no defender of the USSR. As a libertarian Marxist\/communist with anarchist influences as well, I think that on some level, in practice, Bolshevism was a profoundly anti-worker ideology which did a lot to harm the international socialist movement. But if we want to be rigorous, we shouldn't forget that there were deaths that the Soviet government *prevented* too. They probably don't outnumber the deaths that you count against them, but they might offset that number quite a lot. I mean, we forget that in 1916 Russia was quite underdeveloped. It was quite a backward feudal system with most people living as peasant serfs. For all of its faults, the Soviet Union did industrialize and develop a modern economy extremely quickly, and that has pros and cons, but it did mean more access to healthcare, better technologies, more progressive stances of sex and gender relations, the end of a lot of Czarist abuses...

{"author":"TheTranscendentOther","body":"So that pretty much covers it. \nTl;dr:\n\n(1) There are a lot of different kinds of Marxists and they have different values and different rationales for why they agree with Marxism (libertarian Marxists opposed the USSR, Mao's China, and all other dictatorships, and in fact were quite persecuted in the USSR-- I don't know as much about China). So you have to understand the specific details of various left-wing ideologies to answer your question).\n\n(2) It's completely meaningless rhetoric to throw around death tolls for economic systems in a world that is extremely complex and dynamic, with innumerable factors interacting at every moment, and depends entirely on what someone wants to choose to count or exclude (if you want serious indicators of what the economy was like under a so-called socialist state versus a capitalist state then you need to look at multiple social indicators... In fact, even if you just want to understand the state of *your own* economic system, you have to look at multiple social indicators-- the GDP or growth rate tells you almost nothing in isolation). And if you insist on trying to add up deaths caused by communists or Marxists, then by any comparable tally capitalism at least equals communism, and may surpass it-- but again, that depends entirely on how you choose to count. Maybe capitalism has caused 1 million deaths, maybe it's caused 500 million deaths-- we don't know because \"capitalism\" is not a cause of death and neither is \"Marxism.\"\n\nIf you have any sincere questions I'm glad to answer them. The differences between specific historical left-wing tendencies and why people start advocating them is a whole other conversation, but if you're serious about wanting to understand this stuff then it's pretty key.

{"author":"TheSutphin","body":"Ninja edit: please, anyone, correct me where I'm wrong. \n\nLet me preface this with I'm not an economics major, or that super knowledgeable about tariffs.\n\nWhat I can say is that having no tariffs on these things means a couple of things. \n\nFirst off if the tariffs are eliminated, the commodity, in this case cars, will be cheaper to buy in both the EU and the US (and China if they commit to 0 tariffs) for consumers. You and me. That doesn't mean the company can't raise their pieces somewhat as they don't need to be so cheap to still look cheap with the added tax of the tariff. \n\nSecondly, it means companies have a much lower barrier for entry into a market. Which means they can spread to other various markets in the EU or US that they haven't historical been in, or have been pushed out of because of the extra cost of the tariff. This means it can disrupt various workers jobs as one company can come in with a very cheap good, or create hobs for other people as a new plant can be made in the respective market. More or less leading to my third point.\n\nThirdly, it means the market, the global, 0 tariff, just regular market grows. With all the pros and cons that a market has. The anarchy of it. The disruptive nature of it. The competitive nature of it. Like my second point is saying, there's less of a barrier for entry. Just the barrier of transportation and selling. It's much cheaper for a company to move their products, cars, around the global market this way, allowing for more profits for said company.\n\nFourthly, a tariff is a glorified tax. This would most likely mean less money for the government, but I'm not sure the actual impact of that or severity.\n\nPolitically, this is a great move for the bourgeoisie and capitalist. For the consumer and worker, it has its pros and cons. I honestly do not know if the cons out weigh the pros, but if I were a betting man, I would say this only strengthen the rich and their grasp.

So revolutionary humanism could only be a \u2018class humanism\u2019, \u2018proletarian humanism\u2019. The end of the exploitation of man meant the end of class exploitation. The liberation of man meant the liberation of the working class and above all liberation by the dictatorship of the proletariat. For more than forty years, in the U.S.S.R., amidst gigantic struggles, \u2018socialist humanism\u2019 was expressed in the terms of class dictatorship rather than in those of personal freedom.[1]\n\n&gt;The end of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the U.S.S.R. opens up a second historical phase. The Soviets say, in our country antagonistic classes have disappeared, the dictatorship of the proletariat has fulfilled its function, the State is no longer a class State but the State of the whole people (of everyone). In the U.S.S.R. men are indeed now treated without any class distinction, that is, as persons. So in ideology we see the themes of class humanism give way before the themes of a socialist humanism of the person.\n\nThis is the basic point which is quite simple. To put it even more simply, classes do not have the same properties as individuals, they are emergent phenomenon. The contention is that Marx's analysis shifted from individuals to classes, and as a result his language changed (signalling a fundamental change in epistemology). The secondary claim is that shifting back to the language of alienation and the human potential of every individual represents the rise of revisionism and the defeat of proletarian class power. Gramsci deals with a similar idea in his argument against Croce's idealism. You have not articulated where they differ since neither is an advocate of the naive liberalism you claim to be Marx's (see for example Gramsci on the Preface to The Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy which is the most \"deterministic\" and structuralist of all of Marx's writings).\n\nAlso sorry, my memory was a bit faulty, it's the category of fetishism Althusser is interested in, not reification which is an attempt to mediate between it and alienation as radically different concepts.","created_utc":1535732968,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

If it was or is such, that is only because it is a product of the behavior of the German proletariat, in itself a distorted expression of the socialist class struggle. All of us are subject to the laws of history, and it is only internationally that the socialist order of society can be realized. The Bolsheviks have shown that they are capable of everything that a genuine revolutionary party can contribute within the limits of historical possibilities. They are not supposed to perform miracles. For a model and faultless proletarian revolution in an isolated land, exhausted by world war, strangled by imperialism, betrayed by the international proletariat, would be a miracle.\n&gt; \n&gt; What is in order is to distinguish the essential from the non-essential, the kernel from the accidental excrescencies in the politics of the Bolsheviks. In the present period, when we face decisive final struggles in all the world, the most important problem of socialism was and is the burning question of our time. It is not a matter of this or that secondary question of tactics, but of the capacity for action of the proletariat, the strength to act, the will to power of socialism as such. In this, Lenin and Trotsky and their friends were the first, those who went ahead as an example to the proletariat of the world; they are still the only ones up to now who can cry with Hutten: \u201cI have dared!\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the essential and enduring in Bolshevik policy. In this sense theirs is the immortal historical service of having marched at the head of the international proletariat with the conquest of political power and the practical placing of the problem of the realization of socialism, and of having advanced mightily the settlement of the score between capital and labor in the entire world. In Russia, the problem could only be posed. It could not be solved in Russia.
