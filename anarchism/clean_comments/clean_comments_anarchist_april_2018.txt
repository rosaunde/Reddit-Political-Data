The definition of what exactly \"fake news\" is has never quite been made clear - yet this hasn\u2019t stopped major corporate media outlets and even the U.S. Congress from rushing to curb this uniquely pernicious and dangerous threat.\n\n&gt;The primary response to this alleged crisis - the creation of a tiered, fact-checking system for social media that effectively bifurcates \u201creal news\u201d and \u201cfake news\u201d - has many in alternative, leftist, and libertarian media claiming the anti-Fake News algorithms made by Twitter, Facebook, and Google have reduced their web traffic and readership. While it\u2019s difficult to gauge the specifics of these individual reports, it does seem clear at this point that dissident media has taken a hit from efforts to stop co-called \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n&gt;So what are the origins of this panic and whom does it benefit?

This is why the \"liberal\" new york times(incidentally run as a nepotistic family business) has supported every major war from Vietnam to Iraq. Individual journalists may have anti-power opinions, but they either learn early on that this is not compatible with making a successful career - and internalise the values that are needed to make it to the top, or they are censored, like when James Risen wanted to be critical of the Iraq War but the NYT wanted to stay 'in mainstream opinion' and not be too critical of it: https:\/\/theintercept.com\/2018\/01\/03\/my-life-as-a-new-york-times-reporter-in-the-shadow-of-the-war-on-terror\/\n\nIf you don't have time to watch a full documentary or read the book, go through this youtube playlist: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tTBWfkE7BXU&amp;list=PLHZGTTZG6HcIcV9M7h4z8QHVM2pFWpaag\n\nOr for further discussion with people familiar with the model, visit r\/chomsky","created_utc":1522603115,"score":36,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

We already have many gun control laws in place, some states are very strict. NJ has some of the strictest laws in the U.S. but has very low gun violence and no Mass shootings since 1949 to back them up.

We all demand our *own* rights, whatever they may be. If that's a safe space if you're trans, that's okay. If that's establishing a democratic workplace, that's okay.

The point is that the rejection of politics is the **ideal** of anarchism. The same way the the abolition of the state is also the ideal of anarchism even though it is also literally impossible. Going back to where this argument started I'd say the point is that ultimately its odd for a supposed anarchists to be confused or dislike when people say they aren't \"political\" when rejection of politics is an **ideal** of anarchism to begin with. Its akin to saying you don't like when anarchists say they are \"anti-state\" or want to \"abolish the state\". Of course this is \"practically\" impossible in reality but it doesn't matter since this is the **ideal** that anarchists strive for regardless. Such a blatant misunderstanding of the ideals of anarchism makes me wonder whether you understand anarchism's arguments to begin with or worse, reject them for your own brand of pragmatism.","created_utc":1522642024,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Of course not, its literally the textbook definition of self-defense.

Take the desperate and the poor and brainwash them. I know I won't get a lot of people agreeing with me here, but to me that's a population that warrants at least a little sympathy.

History has shown that the life of a revolutionary is one that rarely ends up positively for the revolutionary themselves, but that the is the unique path that we sometimes choose, to place a goal, a dream, an idea above your own life and to fight until your death for it. That sacrifice is vindicated when those of us who are left carry their message and fight for what they believe in. Your daughter died fighting for a free, democratic and just world. There's no nobler cause, there never has been. I can't imagine losing a daughter, but all I can say is keep spreading the message, keep fighting and keep going. The whole world is burning, but brave women like Anna are the reason we aren't surrounded by ash. RIP.","created_utc":1522677082,"score":86,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

It benefits capitalism with the trainers, and diet plans, and memberships, and highly specialized foods, etc.. so there is a lot of money inherently attached to a thing like that. Another one would be gay marriage. Marriage in its current state is ultimately an assimilating tool that benefits capitalist institutions and statistically increases social stability. Another institutions that is about increased financial gain and social stability.\n\nSo it's these larger trends that are meant to bring people into a more normative and manageable way of being and living. They are often backed by laws or made directly of laws. They are about altering the people's modes of beings, reaching inside people to create these \"docile and self managing bodies\" (literally, bodies, but also who we are as like an independent subjective Self). \n\nYou telling someone something out of genuine concern and care isn't this at all. Like you aren't part of those institutions and industries, profit from them or benefit from the control that they extend to capitalist and government groups. \n\nEasiest way I can describe it is it's on a big systemic scale where systems of power have developed ways to control the way we want to live, look like, and be.

It basically reduces things down to looking out exclusively for yourself is the only moral thing to do and it is \"objectively\" measured through wealth. In the child sex slave example, an objectivist could argue that the child would seek employment elsewhere, or that it is the parents responsibility to provide enough money to prevent the slavery from happening, or that people wouldn't hire slaves because they themselves wouldn't want to be slaves and somehow this would prevent them from doing so (note: I struggle to understand how anyone can seriously believe this and as such have trouble reiterating objectivist arguments.

Tuwing eleksyon, nag-co-conduct kami ng mga anti-election na campaigns,\u201d\n\nThat's what infoshops typically do. They create publications. As for us, we talk about the floods, and we criticize the local politicians. Every election, we also conduct anti-election campaigns. \n\n&gt; \u201cNandito \u2018yung mga practical solutions sa mga problemang kinakaharap natin. Hindi naman nila [anarchists] inaangkin. \u2026 \u2018Yung mga ginagawang activities hindi nila inaangkin na kami lang pwedeng gumawa nito, na kami \u2018yung founder or vanguard or pioneer ng ganitong practice \u2026 May mga ganoon, dati siguro. Mga old school tawag namin [sa kanila],\u201d\n\nThe practical solutions to our current problems are here. Anarchists don't claim to have ownership of these solutions. The activities that they do, they don't go and say \"Only we can do this, we're the founders, or the vanguard, or the pioneers of these practices. Where there others like that? Of course, in the past. We call them oldschool. \n\n&gt; \u201cWalang recruitment, walang organization dito. \u2026 Pero hindi ibig sabihin na disorganized tayo, hindi ibig sabihin na kanya-kanya tayo,\u201d \n\nThere's no recruitment, no organization here. That's not to say that we're disorganized, or that we do everything on our own. \n\n&gt; \u201cOrganized tayo sa paraan na voluntary \u2018yung process ng pag-oorganize natin at nakabatay iyon sa sarili natin \u2014 kung ano ang kaya nating i-taya, i-commit na oras, na resources, at iba pa,\u201d he says. \u201cHindi ito \u2018yung para maging aktibista ka, sasali ka sa LSF [Libertarian Socialist Federation] \u2026 parang si Bonifacio, tapos makabayan ka? Hindi ganyan iyan,\u201d \n\nOur way of organizing is a voluntary process. It's based on what we can contribute. Whatever you can contribute, you contribute. Commit your time, resources, etc. It's not like you become an activist, and join the LSF [Libertarian Socialist Federation]... like Andres Bonifacio, Philippine revolutionary, and then you become a nationalist. It's not like that. \n\n&gt; \u201cAng focus nila sisirain mo \u2018yung symbols ng oppression, ng capitalism, kaya kadalasan nabibiktima yung Starbucks, McDonalds.\u2018Yung mga malalaking corporate symbols, \u2018yun 'yung mga binabanatan nila,\u201d says Umali. \n\nTheir focus is on destroying symbols of oppression, of capitalism. That's why they target Starbucks, McDonald's. The large corporate symbols, that's what they go for. \n\n&gt; \u201cKasi dati, yung mga 1980s na punk, mas cultural \u2018yun eh. \u2026 Sex Pistols na anarchy \u2018yun. Karamihan sa kanila, mas na-o-organize pa ng Left,\u201d he says. \u201cPero mga 1996, diyan na nagsulputan na nililinaw ng mga indibidwal na ito na hindi sila Marxist, hindi kami leftists, kami ay mga anarchists.\u201d\n\nBecause before, the 80's punks, it was more cultural. It was Sex Pistols anarchy. A lot of them organized with the Left. But around 1996, people started to clarify their positions, that they weren't Marxists, that we weren't leftists, that we were anarchists. \n\n&gt; \u201cTokhang, tokhang,\u201d\n\nA black humor joke. Tokhang Tokhang is a slang term for when police knock on your door in a drug raid. It's also slang for an extrajudicial killing. \n\n&gt; \u201c\u2019Yung involvement ko sa mga anarchists, nagsimula sa simbahan. .. tawag sa kanila mga Mennonite and Anabaptists tapos \u2018yung tradition ng simbahan ngayon mas naka-ayon doon sa justice and peace na usapin. May pagka anti-authoritarian din ang nature,\u201d says de Mesa, still an active member of Peace Church Philippines, instantly breaking the image of the stereotypical churchgoer one may conventionally imagine.\n\nMy involvement with anarchists started in the church. They were called Mennonites and Anabaptists, and their church tradition focuses on justice and peace, and it was anti-authoritarian in nature. \n\n&gt; \u201cHalos madami silang pinagsasaluhang value system ng mga anarchists. Hindi sila naniniwala sa absolute na kapangyarihan ng State. Basta \u2018yung allegiance ay wala sa estado or sa presidente, kundi [na kay] Jesus Christ, sa broader church, at nasa community,\u201d he adds.\n\nMost of their value system matched with the anarchists. They didn't believe in the absolute power of the state. As long as your allegiance is with Jesus Christ, with the broader church, and in the community, you cannot pledge allegiance to the state or any president. \n\n&gt; \u201cKahit anong gawin mo na activity or campaign na may kinalaman sa reduction ng emissions, ano \u2018yun, 350 \u2018yun most likely ... Maraming mga ganoon din [ang] ginagawa sa anarchist na community,\u201d Baclagon says.\n\nAs long as you're involved in an emission reduction campaign or activity, it's probably with 350.org. A lot of people in there are also in the anarchist community. \n\n&gt;\u201c\u2019Pag magtratrabaho ka [kasi] nasa ano ka parin, nasa sistema ka parin eh. Ganoon parin \u2018yung problema. Eh mag-sarili ka nalang. Gumawa ka nalang ng sarili mong diskarte,\u201d Solis says. \u201cNa-experience ko na \u2018yung working class na buhay. Wala ring mangyayari hanggang pagtanda mo, hangga't kamatayan mo, nasa [baba] ka parin ng [pinakababa].\u201d\n\nAs long as you're working where are you? You're still in the system right? That's where the problem lies. Better to be on your own. Focus on your own hustle. I've experienced the working class life. Nothing will happen as long as you remember this, when you die, you're still as low as dirt. \n\n&gt;\u201cActually, \u2018yun ang dahilan kung bakit ako nag-dedeclare na anarchist ako. Kasi kung tutuusin wala namang pangangailangan na sabihin mo na anarchist ako \u2026 Ang sa akin, political necessity ang pag-declare ko na anarchist ako. Kasi merong Left na nag-do-dominate siya, sinasabi niya na ang rebolusyon nila ay kung ano lang ang sinasabi ng Left,\u201d Umali explains.\n\nActually, that's why I call myself an anarchist. Because, from your point of view, there wasn't any reason to call myself an anarchist. For me though, it was a political necessity to declare myself an anarchist. Because there's a Left that dominates. They say that \"revolution\" is only what the Left says it is. \n\n&gt;\u201cNaging Marxist-Lennist, naging Maoist. Kaya kung mapapansin mo, anarchy siya, hindi siya naka-attach sa pangalan. Hindi katulad ni Marx, kilala mo na kung sino yung lider niya, kilala mo na sino si Lenin, si Mao, or kung sino ang mga Bolsheviks,\u201d he continues. \u201cWalang ownership [ang anarchy]. \u2018Yun \u2018yung sinasabi kanina ni Taks, \u2018yung mga ginagawa din namin [sa infoshop], recognition din ito na ginawa na ito ng mga ninuno natin dati. So sino ka para pag-arian mo at sasabihan mong, \u2018kami ang gumagawa nito?\u2019\u201d\n\nIt became Marxist Leninism, and Maoism. But if you notice, anarchy, anarchy isn't attached to any thinker. It's not like Marx, where you know who the leader is. People know who Lenin, Mao and the Bolsheviks are. No one owns anarchy. That's what Taks was saying, what we do in the inforshops, we recognize that it's passed down from those who came before. So how can anyone come along and say \"This is our work?\"\n\n&gt;\u201cBa\u2019t tayo naging makabayan eh komunista pala tayo? Kasi talagang oxymoron eh. Doon talaga akong unang nagkaroon ng duda. Tapos kinuwestiyon ko \u2018yung Protracted People\u2019s War. Baka naman maubos na yung kalikasan natin, giyera parin tayo ng giyera,\u201d he recalls.\n\nWhy did we become nationalists if we were actually communists? It's an oxymoron yeah? That's when I had a realization. Then I questioned Protracted People's War. We're here killing the Earth, and we're still fighting our wars. \n\n&gt;\u201c\u2018Yung sa kasaysayan kasi, \u2018yung role ni Jesus Christ ay chinallenge yung State. Chinallenge \u2018yung Roman empire sa ibang lifestyle,\u201d de Mesa explains. \u201cNatutunan namin na mas nakikita namin si Jesus sa mga anarchists. \u2026 Sila \u2018yung ginagawa nagpapakain sa mga nagugutom, dumadalaw sa mga may sakit \u2026 Tapos basic \u2018yung self-agency. Napakalakas \u2018yung pag-recognize nung capacity ng individual na mag-ambag sa kabutihan ng mas nakakarami.\u201d\n\nIn history, the role of Jesus Christ was to challenge the State. He challenged the Roman Empire with a different lifestyle. We found out that we could see Jesus with the anarchists. They're the ones who are feeding the poor, healing the sick, and the self agency is basic. It's empowering to recognize the capacity of the individual to help the masses. \n\n&gt;\u201cHindi naman pwedeng hindi ka kikilos dahil hindi mo siyang magagampanan ng tuluyan eh. Kasi kung hindi ka kumilos kasi hindi mo siya nagampanan, walang nabago,\u201d he says.\n\nYou can't just do nothing just because it's not your responsibility to uphold. If you do nothing, nothing will change, so act!\n\n\n&gt;\u201cTingin ko, \u2018di ko din naman aabutin sa lifetime [ang malawakang anarchism.] \u2026 Tingin ko ang pinaka-ma-co-contribute [talaga] natin ay mag-iwan ng maraming materyales,\"\n\nIf you ask me, anarchism will never come in our lifetimes. I think that our greatest contribution is the foundation that we leave behind. ","created_utc":1522711423,"score":9,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"HeloRising","body":"As easy as it is to throw stones, we have to remember the benefit of hindsight.\n\nThere were dozens of Hitlers and Mussolinis around Europe during the early 1900's and the majority of them, even the ones that attained actual political power, fizzled out within a few months to years. \n\nNazism also didn't have the connotations it has today and, back then, attracted a lot of support from people by being a broad-base appeal movement. Part of how the Nazis were able to become prominent was this ideological flexibility that they could be what their supporters wanted them to be and didn't let political dogmatism get in their way.\n\nIf you look at some of the founding documents of the Nazi party, they ignored virtually all of them once they took power.\n\nIf you want people to blame, a big part of the responsibility for the ascendancy of the Nazis and of fascists more generally are conservative, establishment allies. These conservatives allies see fascists as a potential political tool to leverage to increase enthusiasm and support for their own party while simultaneously fighting against the forces of the left.\n\nIn both Italy and Germany, it was conservative members of the political establishment that helped get fascists into positions where they could later exploit (or more usually create *then* exploit) a political\/governmental crisis and secure power.\n\nFascists by themselves are generally not able to secure meaningful political control. They're simply too radical and too extreme for the average person to consider supporting. They have to have some kind of moderate-ish wing for people to feel comfortable coming under that umbrella.","created_utc":1522735939,"score":10,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

There would probably be a different response from liberals who were people of color.\n\nGoing alone to a protest without people you know is dangerous for so many reasons. You can't just trust a mob of strangers. Infiltrators have always been a thing. Know that allies are different than friends. You need friends and allies.\n\nThere has to be some kind of metric for unity. Simple blanketed black and white rules are not the way to go.\n\nWe're all socially programmed to some degree, we have to be to cope, no matter how awesomely radical an anarchist we are. In a stressful situation, people tend to revert to what they have practiced or experienced the most. Racial programming runs deep. Internalized oppression makes people do strange things. You have to know that your friends and allies have defeated social programming through their ideology.\n\nPeople rarely sacrifice their privilege. Only align with them in situations where they don't have to sacrifice their privilege. Or let them be at the front lines to get beaten, killed, arrested, tortured, etc. if they are the true ally or friend they claim to be. Let them be the white savior they claim to be a few times before you really trust them.\n\nIf you're around white people, anyone that passes for white. Realistically, as a person of color, you have to know how far those white people are willing to extend their white privilege to help people of color, you. If you don't know.

We work with publishers to digitize and make searchable their copyrighted work, so we do not own any of the content that is on JSTOR. But!  did you know that JSTOR has worked with our publishing partners to make that content available in a variety of ways for those not at higher ed institutions? \n\n1. Graduated? Graduating? Check to see if your uni offers alumni access here.\n\n2. We offer free online reading programs. Sign up for a MyJSTOR account and you can read up to three articles online every two weeks. More info on how to register here.  \n\n3. Open Access content - everything published prior to 1925 in the U.S. and 1870 abroad is free to read and download.  Additionally, there are more than 500 open access ebooks and a number of open access journal articles that publishers have made available. You can find these by performing a search and then, on the results page, in the left-hand side bar, scroll down and click \u201cRead and Download\u201d while you are not logged in.\n\n4. Many public libraries offer access to JSTOR - check with yours. NYPL and BPL are two that do off the top of my head. \n\n5. JSTOR Daily is our online magazine - outside authors write articles on a number of topics but must cite their sources from articles on JSTOR! And we link to and open the articled that are cited in each story. So, you can read the short version and explore the research that supports it. \n\nI hope this is helpful!\n\njstor\n\nOH HEY, THIS AGAIN. \n\nUpdate!

{"author":"Like1OngoingOrgasm","body":"BE AN OPEN ACCESS GUERILLA\n\n&gt;Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for \nthemselves. The world's entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries \nin books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of \nprivate corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the \nsciences? You'll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier. \n\n&gt;There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought \nvaliantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure \ntheir work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But \neven under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. \nEverything up until now will have been lost. \n\n&gt;That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their \ncolleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? \nProviding scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to \nchildren in the Global South? It's outrageous and unacceptable. \n\n&gt;\"I agree,\" many say, \"but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they \nmake enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it's perfectly legal \u2014 \nthere's nothing we can do to stop them.\" But there is something we can, something that's \nalready being done: we can fight back. \n\n&gt;Those with access to these resources \u2014 students, librarians, scientists \u2014 you have been \ngiven a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world \nis locked out. But you need not \u2014 indeed, morally, you cannot \u2014 keep this privilege for \nyourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords \nwith colleagues, filling download requests for friends. \n\n\n\n&gt;Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have been \nsneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by \nthe publishers and sharing them with your friends. \n\n&gt;But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. It's called stealing or \npiracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a \nship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn't immoral \u2014 it's a moral imperative. Only \nthose blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy. \n\n&gt;Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate \nrequire it \u2014 their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the politicians they \nhave bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who \ncan make copies. \n\n&gt;There is no justice in following unjust laws. It's time to come into the light and, in the \ngrand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public \nculture. \n\n&gt;We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with \nthe world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need \nto buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific \njournals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open \nAccess. \n\n&gt;With enough of us, around the world, we'll not just send a strong message opposing the \nprivatization of knowledge \u2014 we'll make it a thing of the past.

The only thing welfare does is keep people trapped within a continuous cycle of dependency on the state apparatus to the point whereby they rely on it for their very survival. It essentially bribes the masses into backing the state against anyone who may hold a libertarian or anarchist tendency. In other words, it is just another weapon in the toolkit of the state.\n\nWhat disadvantaged people need is not welfare programs - they need jobs that give them pride and feel appreciated; they need opportunities and make them feel like they're making a difference; that what they do has worth to the lives of others. This can only happen through cooperatives, workplace democracy, flat organizational structures, a voice in the governing of their towns and communities etc. There is no justification for involuntary taxation.

Many people have abandoned their courses due to this idea.\n\n\nThis thought that public college and schools are marxist is WRONG. Unfortunately, teenagers tend to believe that everything they are taught is marxist. They want everything to be private: hospitals, schools, streets, colleges.

Although anarchists in Hamilton have attended HAF rallies, we mostly haven\u2019t chosen to organize around them. Although we have different reasons, we aren\u2019t very excited about antifascism as distinct from other anarchist practice and especially not with the demo\/counter-demo ritual.... The counter-demo model has succeeded in mobilizing crowds of people at different times and definitely represents a step forward in terms of building an analysis of the far-right, but when it comes to going beyond symbolic protest, very few are prepared to do more than hold signs.\n\nI am desperately trying to understand the logic behind this. So far I am that this is really just an example of being stuck up and more concerned with maintaining a social club than exercising politics. In what sense is organizing with a mass organization \"antifascism as distinct from other anarchist practice\"? What does this mean? it sounds like they are saying that engaging with people (some of whom may be communists and some of whom may be simply liberals or relatively apolitical but antiracist) is some how a threat to ones own phenomoneolgical experience as an anarchist? \n\nMoreover the distain for the \"ritual demo\/counter-demo\" and \"symbolic protest\" seems to me to be nothing other than ignorance of the significance of how public discourse works. Like yes, it is important to literally bash fascists but two points here: (1) dont underestimate the power of public discourse in informing how people think, and this has implications for how people (on both the far right and the far left) attempt to change what is acceptable within public discourse (in the past coupe of years the far right has done a really good job of both weaponziing irony and using dog whistels to bring facism back into the public sphere, and you will notice how the far right has really declined recently in large part because of how Charlottesville really turned their whole strategy against them); this is also consequently reason why that action by the \"ungovernables\" that precipitated these events was dumb af. (2) if we admit that some of the people in the counter demonstrations are newbies (who themeslevs may not be ready to devote themselves to literally physically attacking a fascist) then what good does it do for politics if we are to chose to disengage with them?

{"author":"m3htevas","body":"The practical stuff is going to be different depending on your jurisdiction, how many creature comforts you want, and your willingness to ignore the law.\n\nIf you and yours want to live very minimalistically, you can avoid having to deal with building codes and such. If you want things like roofs, which may be necessary depending on your local weather, you'll need to learn your local building codes, if only to know which ones your breaking and how much your risking in doing so.\n\nI'd try asking these questions (vaguely, without mentioning your leftist leanings) on your city or county subreddit if you have one, or some other social networking site. Go as low down as you can to the geographic location you intend to inhabit.\n\nI don't know much about purchasing land\/houses other than that it's most often done through a realtor.\n\nLet's be real though; unless you are quite wealthy, you will not be able to do this. Unless you can pay upfront in cash for the property (or are willing to squat), someone is going to have to hold down a job to pay the mortgage. You could split that five or ten ways, but the more people you bring in, the more land you'll need, or the more building codes you'll need to ignore. I've known communes that would have one or two members (usually rotating to avoid burnout) hold down a full time job to pay for a mortgage. Other groups had everyone work part time. \n\nThe feasibility of any of these strategies for you will depend a lot on where you live, how many like minded people you can get on board, and how much cash you can pull together both immediately and over the term of a fifteen to thirty year mortgage. Unless you have access to a small fortune, in which case just find a realtor who specializes in rural properties and go nuts.\n\nHope this helps. Feel free to ask more questions, just be careful about pii.

Pursuit of this work will likely require both partnerships among research organizations and the involvement of political actors, media companies, and individuals interested in responding to this phenomenon. We envision this research agenda as a starting point, and we acknowledge that research, data, and analysis alone will not be able to reverse Truth Decay.\n\n&gt; We will pursue this research agenda with the objectivity and nonpartisanship that lie at RAND's core, and we invite others to take on pieces of the agenda. Because of the vital threat that Truth Decay presents to the health and future of U.S. democracy, we urge interested individuals and organizations to join with us in identifying ways to study Truth Decay and to promote the need for facts, data, and analysis in civic and political discourse---and in American public life more generally.

Modern scholarship suggests instead that the state is a comparatively recent development, emerging in a few societies around the time of the Neolithic which then conquered other neighboring societies. \n\nAnarchists would argue that, rather than capital and the state being the inevitable result of our nature, these institutions *shape* our \"nature\" in negative ways.

This obscures the fact that colonization involved warfare, enslavement, forced conversion, disease and sexual violence. \n\nAnd that is not only according to \"post-colonial\" sources, but also European primary sources such as [Bartolome de las Casas](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas)'s work. Bartolome was himself a Spanish Catholic, and he was disgusted by the abuses he saw in the New World, including natives being [strung up and burned alive](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas#\/media\/File:Bartolom%C3%A9_de_las_Casas_Regionum_355385740_MG_8829_A3-f1.tif) and [colonists feeding people to dogs for having gay sex](http:\/\/www.gay-art-history.org\/gay-history\/gay-art\/native-american-homosexual-art\/de-bry-balboa-dogs-gay-persecution.html). In this regard, while Walker's *data* may be completely factual, the *conclusions he draws from the data* serve an ideological end.\n\n&gt;The rise of modern, capitalist states has seen a worldwide reduction in poverty. \n\nFirst of all, I'd like to note that this view, considered in isolation, is 100% in keeping with classical Marxism. 19th century modernist socialists believed that just as capitalism was a marked improvement over feudalism, socialism (executed properly) would be a further improvement. The question is not whether capitalism has created more material abundance than existed previously, but whether the current class structure is the best possible distribution of wealth.\n\nPoverty is not a mere lack of of material resources, but a social relation of deprival among people. If you have only a tent and some metal tools in a nomadic society, you are not impoverished - you have all the resources you need to survive within that society. If that same society is conquered by an industrialized nation, suddenly the nomads are impoverished, when before they were self-sufficient.\n\n&gt;Your life and property are only worth as much as what protects it, or how much others want it.\n\nThe anti-capitalist anarchist Max Stirner made a very similar point. And if property is determined purely by might, why shouldn't those deprived of property unite to claim what they have been denied?\n\n&gt;Without police presence, you have blacks attacking Koreans in LA because they have different skin color.\n\nWhat historical phenomena do you think led some black people in LA to adopt a racist ideology? The way you phrase it, it makes it sound like you're saying black people are fundamentally violent and irrational - that \"blacks\" are inherently prone to racial violence and that a (presumably nonblack) authority is needed to keep them in check. \n\nAnalysis which ignores historical factors easily becomes just-so stories to excuse existing prejudices. It is awfully telling that \"blacks\" are specifically coded in this example as racist, but Koreans who fear being attacked *specifically by black people* are not considered racist. I've known plenty of black people with Asian friends and vice versa, as well as people of mixed black and Asian descent. \n\n&gt;. Racism is permissible when there is a lack of rule of law, at least in a society where individual rights are protected.\n\nThat perspective ignores the role of state actors in shaping both racist ideology and racist behavior. Many of the most infamous examples of racism in human history - the Holocaust, South African apartheid, Jim Crow, the Trail of Tears - were organized by states and justified thru state propaganda efforts. \n\nAlso, while in-group\/out-group prejudice has always existed, specific categories of race are culturally dependent. The classical Greeks and Romans believed that Celtic and Germanic people were muscle-bound noble savages who ran naked thru the woods and that Africans were brilliant yet effete, irrational, sensual and not as sturdy as Mediterranean peoples. Irish people were considered a missing link between \"Caucasoids\" and \"Negroids\" by Victorian anthropologists.\n\n In both these cases, race ideology serves the interest of a state - the interests of the Roman empire going to war against the Germans and trading with Africans for exotic spices, or the interests of Britain subjugating Ireland (and subjugating West Africa even more harshly). \n\n","created_utc":1522875092,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Of course, a partial reason for that is that, historically, Zionism forced the rise of Palestinian nationalism (this is a standard effect), and thus the Palestinian identity of Bedouins grew, relative to their Bedouin identity. Perhaps another reason is the modernization, which forced them to be less nomadic, and hence less in touch with their Bedouin identity.","created_utc":1522876626,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"CosmicRaccoonCometh","body":"&gt; he has a deep aversion for all forms of weakness, which he traces back in origin to the Jews.\n\nFalse. He does not trace back all forms of weakness to Jews. That isn't even a bad reading of Nietzsche, it is just a straight up falsehood. Perhaps what you are looking for is his condemnation of slave morality, which, in western civilization, he does assert was strongly influenced by Judaism and Christianity  -- but criticizing those moral systems as a key feature in the creation of slave morality in western civilization is a big freaking difference than seeing all weakness as coming from Jews. \n\n&gt; the strong are only strong by virtue of the fact that they are able to exercise their \u2018will to power\u2019 over the weak. \n\nNietzsche expressly doesn't assert this. As he says, his highest types (the most powerful people in his eyes) are the philosopher, artist and saint. Not the aristocrat (he has scorn for \"the little von\"), the capitalist (whose \"culture\" he dismisses as shop keeper mentality) or even the conqueror (he has praise for many conquerors, but he was also critical of militaristic culture, saying of Germany of his own day, that \"one pays dearly for coming to power, power makes stupid\"). \n\n&gt; The ideal he envisions for man in Zarathustra is certainly interesting, but not if one must abandon compassion and care to reach it.\n\nNietzsche doesn't abandon compassion any more than Stirner or the individualist\/egoist anarchists. He values friendship and community, but rejects the moral and ideological foundations that mass society rests upon. \n\nReally, your reading of Nietzsche is a bad one here. Just as is the case with anyone, there is much to criticize in Nietzsche's work. His views on women are, frankly, idiotic and disgusting. His praise of certain conquerors is, from a practical\/political standpoint,  inconsistent with some of his other ideas and critiques. He really has no cogent political philosophy at all -- which, if one is to reject mass society and politics (which he does),then that is great, but without giving a coherent expression of that view in pragmatic terms, then you are really failing to give a fleshed out worldview . And that leaves one open to the exact misuse and misunderstanding Nietzsche has been so subject to. You can stamp your feet and yell \"please do not mistake me for something else!\" all you want Herr Nietzsche, but unless you give a pragmatic perspective on your own philosophy, you're really leaving your self open to exactly such misinterpretation. \n\nAll that said though, he was not an anti-semite. Not only did he break with Wagner over the musician's anti-semitism, he broke with his own sister for the same reason. He railed against anti-semites in his own works, railed against them in his private letters, ended relationships with dear friends and family because of his intolerance for anti-semites. He saw certain jewish thinkers like Spinoza as his intellectual brethren and held them in the highest regard. \n\nAlso, one key misreading of Nietzsche you may be falling into is to see his condemnation of slave morality as him embracing master morality. That is not the case. He rejects both, and uses his study of both kinds of morality (as well as their imbalanced mixture that western society uses now) as a lesson for what his project actually is, which is the transcendence of both kinds of morality and the development of people capable of being able to generate their own new values.

{"author":"Bent-Bristle","body":"I\u2019m aware of Nietzsche\u2019s overall critique of slave morality and his notion that both Judaism and Christianity are implicated in its perpetuation, but he is quite particular about singling out the Jews in the Genealogy.  It doesn\u2019t get any more concrete than \u201cwith the Jews the slave condition in morality begins.\u201d He goes on to say not religion in the abstract, but specifically, \u201cit was the Jews who, in opposition to the aristocratic equation (good = aristocratic = beautiful = happy = loved by the gods), dared with a terrifying logic to suggest the contrary equation.\u201d \n\nNietzsche is essentially talking out of both sides of his mouth, airing with one breath the prejudices that were common in his day while at the same time distancing himself from those prejudices in the pursuit of his overall vision.\n\nHis views on the mixing of races are also particularly odious and what confirmed this for me.  At one point, he says outright that thinkers of \u2018mixed blood\u2019 can only ever be inferior to those of a predominant race because, being by nature cast out of the tribe, their intellectual faculties are diverted to resolve this psychological predicament and cannot be concentrated in the pursuit of truth as they can by those apparently more secure in their identity.  Not that they might have a window into new insights that those secure within the universal may not have access to, but that they are destined to be muddled thinkers.  So much for the notion of \u201cperspectivalism.\u201d\n\nA few more quotes from the Genealogy as it pertains to the \u2018races:\u2019\n\n&gt; Who can guarantee that modern democracy, still more modern anarchy, and indeed that tendency to the \"Commune,\" the most primitive form of society, which is now common to all the Socialists in Europe, does not in its real essence signify a monstrous reversion \u2014 and that the conquering and master race \u2014 the Aryan race, is not also becoming inferior physiologically?\n\n&gt; But why do you talk of nobler ideals? Let us submit to the facts; that the people have triumphed \u2014 or the slaves, or the populace, or the herd, or whatever name you care to give them \u2014 if this has happened through the Jews, so be it! In that case no nation ever had a greater mission in the world's history. The 'masters' have been done away with; the morality of the vulgar man has triumphed. This triumph may also be called a blood-poisoning (it has mutually fused the races)\n\nWhile it\u2019s clear that he firmly rejected slave morality, it\u2019s not entirely clear that he did not embrace aristocratic morality.  He did reject the notion, much like Kierkegaard did, that bourgeois philistines or petty tyrants could ever be classed as \u2018aristocrats,\u2019 yet he contrasts the master with the slave far from dismissively and in a manner which appears to be at variance with his rejection of militarism:\n\n&gt; One may be perfectly justified in being always afraid of the blonde beast that lies at the core of all aristocratic races, and in being on one's guard: but who would not a hundred times prefer to be afraid, when one at the same time admires, than to be immune from fear, at the cost of being perpetually obsessed with the loathsome spectacle of the distorted, the dwarfed, the stunted, the envenomed?\n\nIt\u2019s easy to say one\u2019s reading is off, but I think it more likely that Nietzsche was a troubled soul plagued by contradictions.  I agree that much of the confusion stems from his penchant for aphorism and metaphor.  One does get the sense that the Ubermensch is something akin to a thinker or saint, not a racist tyrant, but it is not explicitly given this shape as it is with, say, Plato and his notion of philosopher-kings.  \n\nNietzsche\u2019s whole conception seems rather metaphysical, even though he rejects this notion, claiming that the transcendence humans must undergo is a worldly, corporeal one.  Even if one could reduce it to a formulaic artists\/thinkers = masters, this leaves the fact that the vast majority of humans can never be part of Nietzsche\u2019s design, to cross his metaphorical \u2018bridge.\u2019  Where does this leave them then but in a state of ceaseless ressentiment, to be reviled as being in thrall to slave morality?","created_utc":1522891084,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"CosmicRaccoonCometh","body":"&gt; Nietzsche is essentially talking out of both sides of his mouth, airing with one breath the prejudices that were common in his day while at the same time distancing himself from those prejudices in the pursuit of his overall vision.\n\nIf his words are seemingly contradictory, then why take the least charitable reading of those words possible, especially when he makes clear statements in his work and in his private life that would indicate that he himself had nothing but antipathy for anti-semitism? \n\n&gt; His views on the mixing of races are also particularly odious and what confirmed this for me.\n\nHe actually spoke positively about race mixing in some works. I'd have to go through my old books to find exactly which one. \n\n&gt;  At one point, he says outright that thinkers of \u2018mixed blood\u2019 can only ever be inferior to those of a predominant race because, being by nature cast out of the tribe, their intellectual faculties are diverted to resolve this psychological predicament and cannot be concentrated in the pursuit of truth as they can by those apparently more secure in their identity.\n\nWhich book or section are you referring to here? Are you talking about in beyond good and evil where he says that late ages that have race mixing creates weaker people? Because, what he is talking about there is that the people are less cohesive, less tied to their tradition and culture -- less homogeneous and monolithic. But he **isn't** saying that \"strength\" is superior than the \"weakness\", he is saying it is different. He **isn't** saying that we should go back to the volk and recreate the stupid strength of the past through the use of systems of power, but that we should use the weakness as an opportunity to cease pining for the past and to cease recognizing our degenerative culture, and transcend the old master morality\/homogeneity (which we can't go back to anyway) as well as the slavish moralism of weak people who try to overcome their weakness through resentment directed towards others rather than cultivation and growth. \n\n&gt; While it\u2019s clear that he firmly rejected slave morality, it\u2019s not entirely clear that he did not embrace aristocratic morality.\n\nIf you read all of his works and not just certain section it is very clear that he rejected the old aristocracy. When he speaks of his aristocracy he specially says that he is not talking about the aristocracy of \"the little von\" -- or the old, tired, decadent, feudal era claims to aristocracy. And he never talks about a return to master morality, he always talks about destroying the old values and creating new ones. He doesn't talk about undoing what Judaism and Christianity had done to people and culture, but rather using the tools acquired by that experience to overcome both slave and master morality and to make people such that they can create new values.\n\n&gt;  in a manner which appears to be at variance with his rejection of militarism:\n\nThen what shall we do with his long and detailed criticism of how militarism was destroying german culture? Also, on the quote you gave, I would agree he values with more favor the vitality of the type of people he posits as being responsible for the creation of master morality more than the type he posits is responsible for slave morality. But his works don't call for a return to that. They praise it, but he says the measure of culture is the degree to which it fosters the creation of his highest types: the philosopher, the saint and the artist -- the creators of value. Not to the degree that it generates warriors and conquerors. \n\n&gt; I think it more likely that Nietzsche was a troubled soul plagued by contradictions.\n\nOh, he was definitely that. Like I said, his views on women and his failure to cogently address pragmatism are major and significant failings. And, really, the stuff on women is sickening, and he often comes off as one of those bitter mens rights activist types when he talks about women -- or when he tries to talk about politics for that matter. \n\nBut. But but but -- let's call a spade a spade. When we are giving a reading of his works, we can't just decide this passage should go into deciding whether or not he was anti-semitic, but we should ignore this other passage. We shouldn't ignore the viscous polemics against antisemits nor should we ignore the racialist talk of jewish people. We should try to see if we can come up with a reading that takes into account all the passages, and see if the seeming contradictions aren't merely that: seeming. That they aren't contradictions, they are nuances. Maybe misinformed pseudo science based nuances (in that way he was certainly a man of the 19th century), but not necessarily racist contradictions.  \n\n&gt; Where does this leave them then but in a state of ceaseless ressentiment, to be reviled as being in thrall to slave morality?\n\n Look at the Milgram experiments. Not just the one with the learners and teachers, the one's about social pressure too -- like people giving wrong answers to easy questions because the plants in the study before them all gave that answer, or turning the wrong way in the elevator, or the waiting room strange behavior one, etc. Most people, across cultures, are mass minded. They're going to accept the values imprinted onto them in a sadly uncritical manner. Now, I don't think we need to revile that tendency in people, but, I'd like to avoid falling into it as much as possible. I'm not going to call myself a superman or some ridiculous shit for it, or think I'm special for making the attempt -- but, I want to analyze the existence of that tendency so I can notice it in myself and overcome that weakness as much as possible. \n\nAnd egoist anarchism is really a lot about that -- that and identifying the systems which forcefully compel that behavior on me and perpetuate it in society. And I think Nietzsche's philosophy has a lot of insights and overlap with that sort of  project. \n\nAnd, furthermore, I think to ask what happens to everyone else is a strange question. You can't force people out of that default setting. You can't systematically end human weakness and put everyone at the same level. So, does that mean we are relegating or even judging them by acknowledging that? No, not at all. And, similarly, I don't think Nietzsche is reviling those still clinging to mass society and slave morality, he's simply trying to overcome that same weakness in himself and criticizing the social and cultural structures that are simultaneously perpetuated by and perpetuating of that tendency.

{"author":"3kixintehead","body":"Between *principled* libertarians, conservatives, and the alt-right? I'd say many. For one the former are likely to actually have clearly articulated philosophical ideas. Furthermore, I think these are sometimes difficult arguments to come to grips with as a leftist and we should be engaging more carefully with these folks. Alt-right are much more likely to be bigoted and propose many philosophically inconsistent policies such as borderwalls, white nationalist policies, increased police state, and interestingly anti-christian paganism. Many conservatives will disagree with some of these and libertarians disagree with nearly all. Regardless there have been clear clashes between these groups and it is not only useless but uncharitible to group all people on the right together, though I do generally agree that the right is more \"monolithic\". I think it is useful to engage with these sorts of people as many libertarians might become interested in left-libertarianism and conservatives may be at least persuaded to not work with Trump or the alt-right.\n\nI think a really interesting question though, is not their disagreements, which they are usually up front about, but their willingness to work together. It is a well known fact of the history of Nazism that it was given a huge boost by conservatives and classical liberals who were more resistant to working with leftists and the working class than Nazis, thus facilitating their rise to power. Likewise many of all groups voted for Trump, shared alt-right memes, etc.\n\nJust my 2 c's though. ","created_utc":1522901910,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Bent-Bristle","body":"If the contradiction is unambiguously unintentional and there is a more charitable interpretation that can be arrived at, I am more than willing to extend the author the benefit of the doubt.  The trouble is that it is very easy to say one is not something, even fervently believe it to be so, while simultaneously holding views that prove this not to be the case.  \n\nThe passage was indeed the one you have in mind, section 200 in Beyond Good and Evil:\n\n&gt; The man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with one another, who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in his body--that is to say, contrary, and often not only contrary, instincts and standards of value, which struggle with one another and are seldom at peace--such a man of late culture and broken lights, will, on an average, be a weak man. His fundamental desire is that the war which is IN HIM should come to an end; happiness appears to him in the character of a soothing medicine and mode of thought (for instance, Epicurean or Christian); it is above all things the happiness of repose, of undisturbedness, of repletion, of final unity--it is the \"Sabbath of Sabbaths,\" to use the expression of the holy rhetorician, St. Augustine, who was himself such a man.\n\nOne can perhaps forgive Nietzsche for succumbing to the pseudoscience of biologically inherited instincts and values, but if this man of \u2018diversified descent\u2019 is weakened precisely by being unmoored from culture and tradition (a spurious claim in itself), then what is to be said for Nietzsche\u2019s own project, which is above all about doing away with the old verities and replacing them with the new?  Here he says dissolution is the birthing ground for weak men, and he devotes large chunks of the Genealogy to railing against the weak, yet his entire project is aimed at accelerating dissolution.  This is why he lampooned the antiquarian historians in \u201cOn the Use and Abuse of History,\u201d because in revering history and tradition, they stood as an impediment to his vision of transcendence.  Out with the old and in with the new\u2014nebulously articulated, but somehow capable of producing a population of Supermen instead of the tragically conflicted weak men who know not how to think or to become artists or philosophers or saints owing to their lack of grounding in tradition.  These are not differences or nuances.  They are contradictions.  \n\nNow, he does go on in this passage to say that there are some men who are able to use this conflict of \u2018irreconcilable instincts\u2019 (which, let us recall, are simply assumed to exist) as a spur and \u2018stimulus to life,\u2019 men \u2018predestined for conquering and circumventing others\u2019 and cites Caesar (!) as an example.  If there is any truth to be found in this morass, it\u2019s that those with no fixed attachments or tribal loyalties are more likely to find themselves in the conditions which Nietzsche would have seen as ideal for transcendence.  Not to become great military men bent on imperial conquest, but the true transcendence he had in mind.  Of course, they are instead dismissed as outliers, \u2018inexplicable beings,\u2019 \u2018enigmatical men.\u2019\n\nAgain, it\u2019s clear enough that Nietzsche\u2019s notion of \u2018strength\u2019 doesn\u2019t lie in a return to the ideology of Plato\u2019s Thrasymachus\u2014the idea that \u2018justice\u2019 is the advantage of the physically strong.  Though there are sufficient passages throughout his works that unequivocally glorify (and, yes, denounce) these types of men, one does come away with the sense that his \u2018superior\u2019 man is more than a man of brawn and cunning.  \n\nI don\u2019t know what Nietzsche was. One can lionize him as a visionary, but the particular vitriol he reserved for those he saw as weak (he gets peculiarly more colorful in his descriptions of them in the Genealogy), including women, and his fixations on race lead me to believe that there were other factors at play, and I would be lying if I said these didn\u2019t taint his works for me.  I am not of the mind that one can separate the author from his work, to take the good and leave the bad, so to speak.  JS Mill said somewhere that no work can be taken at face value, that there are to be found falsities and nuggets of truth in each, and that we would do well to enjoy the latter without concerning ourselves with the former.  I\u2019m prepared to accept the idea of human transcendence, but I think Nietzsche was intelligent enough to know what the outcome would have been when he set the stage in the terms that he did without articulating a path for achieving his vision.  \n\nAs for the Milgram experiment, I don\u2019t put much stock into it.  Many of the social psychology experiments smack of determinism.  They more reflect the atomized mentality of modern man than any fundamental truth about human nature.  Even the language used to refer to these phenomena (\u2018default setting\u2019) is drawn from computing technology\u2014i.e., a reflection of the zeitgeist.  In Bacon\u2019s era, we modeled ourselves and the world after clockwork.  I wonder how these studies would have been received then, or even 200,000 years ago.  The world these people inhabited was far different than ours.  I\u2019m not a believer in a fixed human nature, and I can\u2019t see how one can get on board with Nietzsche\u2019s goal of an overarching mass transcendence if one has such a cynical view of the masses.","created_utc":1522902709,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"SirBrendantheBold","body":"There are non-anarchist Marxist models which renounce the vanguard.  De Leonism and the leftcoms (particularly council communists) have an extremely libertarian bent to the point of being more closely related to anarchists than state-socialists. They allow for proletarian states to exist but it is, as opposed to Bolshevism, a government that derives its authority from the worker rather than a ruling party. In other words, the soviet rather than politburo. This allows for us to not necessarily subscribe to an instantaneous and total revolution without rationalizing a self-defeating body of hierarchy and abuse.\n\nObviously my own political conclusions influence my answer but I believe syndicalism, anarcho or Marxist, is the ideal transitional lower-phase. When an organisation is turned into a function of regimented violence, it adopts certain rationale to justify its existence and activity. Further, all bureaucracies will seek to justify the continuation of their existence and so any violent one will expand the list of acceptable targets and seek to exaggerate the severity of the threat that justifies itself.\n\nSo we have to be extremely careful never to go the path of the Vanguard specifically because it is, by design and history, guaranteed to devolve into an authoritarian and violent model. Contrast that with the syndicalist approach in which farmers were permitted to not agree to to the collectivization, all political power was democratic and could be removed at any time, all unions and industries were operated internally and required neither bosses nor states to function. In other words, socialism was allowed to spread organically and overthrew capitalism without manufacturing any bodies of violence that would persist after they were needed.\n\nSocialism with cooperation and consent is the objective. Violence must be reserved only for those who seek to own us through force. I think the vanguard is an awful way of achieving socialism because it contradicts its own egalitarian ethos.","created_utc":1522936975,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I do not advocate keto as a diet to stay on forever, I use it as a corrective treatment for metabolic syndrome (high blood pressure, high unbalanced cholesterol, obesity).  I advocate keto as the only way that I have ever successfully lost significant amounts of weight and corrected my metabolic illnesses.\n\nThe Atkins\/Keto vs. Vegetarianism\/Veganism debate has been around a long time, and I am afraid that we won't be able to resolve it here.  Each side of the argument has it's own science to back it up, and each diet has different medical applications.  We could be at this for decades.\n\nI am happy for you that you are able to lead a vegan lifestyle if you want to.  I have no reason to hate anyone for being vegan.

I'm ripping quotes directly from [this article](http:\/\/robgreenfield.tv\/vegan\/) but it's more argument-based than study-based, so citing sources isn't super important in this discussion because a person came up with these points.\n\n\"There are cultures of people who eat meat and animal products in a manner that causes less harm to Earth and animals than some vegan diets do.\" This is the quote I've based my lack of veganism around. Sure, I'll support a vegan comrade, I'll feed them vegan food if I'm cooking for non-vegans as well, and I don't dislike vegans simply because of their food choices, but I choose to eat meat and dairy produced in a non-cruel manner.\n\nExamples in the article: \"[the people of Louisiana's] diets include alligators, crayfish, fish, rabbit, deer and so much more. These swamps are absolutely teeming with life and I believe that when they hunt it responsibly, these folk can eat a more Earth-friendly diet than an urban vegan that purchases everything in packages at the supermarket.\"\n\n\"I think that hunting and eating [the outbreak of boars in Texas] has a much smaller environmental impact (and likely even a positive impact) than just about any vegan food you can buy at the supermarket.\"\n\n\"Hunting deer in your own neck of the woods, like my friends in Wisconsin do, can also be far less destructive than being dependent on large-scale production of any food. These deer live wild, eating grasses their whole life, and no unsustainable resources must be used in their existence.\"\n\nAll of these require the use of local resources, so no \"food factories\" producing animal products can exist in an anarchist society, but they don't need to. By hunting locally, the issue of packaging and transportation is solved too - something many vegan diets fail to address is the animals harmed in the production of packaging and transporting the food (palm oil, for example, is used in crisp packets, and obtaining it requires destroying the habitats of orang-utans).\n\nYou could still argue the killing of animals is inherently inhumane even when they are not kept in factories their whole lives. To that I'd say - lions eat gazelles all the time. We are animals as much as they are, and to consider ourselves above the food chain is arrogant. \"A wolf can kill a deer, and that is nature \u2013 but if we were to hunt a deer, many of us would not consider that nature. Humans are still animals and we are a part of nature, and a part of the natural cycle of life. Yes, we are unique, but so is every other species.

More on this later: \n\n&gt;I think hunting and eating has a much smaller environmental impact than just about any vegan food you can buy on the super market.\n\n&gt; Hunting deer in your own neck of the woods, like my friends in Wisconsin do, can also be far less destructive than being dependent on large-scale production of any food.

All this is well and good... It's not for me, but it is an argument to be made for sure. I don't think killing animals is inherently immoral in itself when done for survival obviously. \n\nBut I would bet very heavily - that you aren't limiting your animal product consumption to deer in the woods behind your house.

If you are hunting deer, but also keeping a gallon of milk in the fridge, or buying steaks from the grocery store or eating hamburgers from a restaurant... you are just adding additional death on top of still consuming mass animal agriculture. \n\nI see these kinds of arguments a lot, and they are never from the people they apply to - because I wouldn't be arguing with those people about food ethics.

If you go to the grocery store and look at the hot dogs, then look at the vegan hot dogs and conclude \"oh, being vegan is so expensive, what a luxury\" - you don't understand in the least. \n\nProduce is cheap. Pasta is cheap. Eating vegan is equally cheap as not eating vegan. The only way this doesn't apply is pre-prepared foods. Sure, to go to the grocery store and buy a bunch of fake-meat products like Tofurky and Daiya cheese... you would run up a bill pretty fast. But Rice? Beans? Spicy Peppers? Onions? Garlic? Leafy greens that haven't been pre-chopped? these things are dirt cheap - and nutritious, and delicious. \n\nThe issue here is with food education, not with classism. We have grown up being lied to about nutrition in so many ways, and the same lobbyists that are pushing that information are also pushing politicians into subsidizing their products to be sold cheaper. That is why pre-fabricated frozen hot pockets are cheaper than pre-fabricated vegan hot pockets... but the raw materials for making very simple, fast food is there - and available, and affordable to anyone that doesn't live in a very, very stark food desert.

Guns also weren't that big of an advantage on their own - muskets were extremely inaccurate and took a very long time to fire. The colonists won mostly due to disease and by playing tribes against each other. \n\nFor more info on this, I'd recommend Charles C. Mann's book, *1491*. It is an introduction to pre-Columbian history for a pop audience that is very well-respected in the field. \n\n&gt;Not all Blacks attack Koreans in racist mobs. This was a historical example of racism when the law was not enforced. That is all. \n\nSorry if I didn't communicate my response well. What I was trying to get at is that that specific prejudice and pattern of violence emerged in a sociological and historical context having to do with poverty and economic rivalry, rather than some instinctual \"tribal\" prejudice. \n\n&gt;What's the argument that socialism would improve standards of living?

For men this means toxic masculinity i.e. boys can't cry, emotional unavailability, celebration of anger and assertiveness (to the point of antisocial behavior) etc.\n\nThe difference is that the roles men are forced into tend to reinforce their position in patriarchal society and possibly elevate them to positions of power.

But he said that they'd have greater success against Franco if they worked together. He invited the CNT to join a committee to coordinate the anti-fascist militias that included various political parties from the Catalan government and the UGT labor union.\n\nThe CNT members obviously couldn't make this decision on their own, as the CNT was a direct democracy. But they passed on his message at a regional CNT congress. \n\nThere was much heated debate, and unfortunately, the question was framed as \"government collaboration\" vs. \"CNT dictatorship\" -- neither of them good options. They didn't think of a third option, which was to call for an anti-fascist militias committee elected from the unions, as Amigos de Durruti later called for. Nor did they think to call for the creation of soviets, and elect members of the committee from the soviets.\n\nIn any case, given a debate between two bad choices, in the end they decided with government collaboration. \n\nThe state had literally offered to overthrow itself, and the CNT refused. It was a big mistake. The anarchists fucked that up big time.

His essay is interesting. http:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/petr-kropotkin-anarchist-morality\n \nI prefer moral sentimentalism because \n1. Morality seems to only superficially vary across cultures\n\n2. Rationalist accounts of morality don't really make sense. Reason dictates the correct steps to take to achieve a goal. There is no way to rationally arrive at moral imperatives. What way can you rationally persuade a King to give up his power? Also if we encountered an alien race that were capable of perfect reason, but incapable of sympathy, how could we persuade them not to attack us, if they decided the best thing for their race would be to take over the earth?\n\n3. Divine accounts require a belief in god\n\n4. The virtues relate more to characteristics that will result in personal success. It's not hard to imagine a person possessing every classic virtue and still directing themselves towards immoral ends. Wisdom is supposed to prevent this, but i don't think anyone has ever possessed what has classically been defined as wisdom. Indeed i think the whole point of Socrates' story about the oracle is that wisdom isn't a human quality.\n\n5. Ethical skepticism is understandable as it is hard to identify if a moral claim is true. The way i think this problem can be resolved is if you take the moral sentimentalist stand point that, moral feeling is a common incident of a common human cognitive system. The operation of the sympathy faculty is whats relevant here. So when, judging whether, a person says \"murder is wrong\" is making a true or false statement, you're not looking at whether this some absolutely objective truth independent of humanity. Rather to determine if the statement is correct, you need to examine whether its the result of the correct functioning cognitive system involved with creating moral sentiments. \nA good analogy is the vision system. If a colourblind person says something is blue, when a healthy human vision system would perceive it as green, then they are not wrong in relation to some kind of absolute objective truth. However they are wrong in relation to the perceptions that ought to generated by a healthy human being. \n\n6. If there is no morality then, why be a libertarian socialist, the smartest thing to do would to enjoy the benefits of being a servant of power.\nEdited: For detail and formatting","created_utc":1523028074,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"azucarleta","body":"\"By August 1991, US defence secretary Dick Cheney was able to describe the war as a 'catharsis' for post-Vietnam America. 'It was almost a healing process for a wound that had been open for a long time,' he said. The real wounds--the tens of thousand of desperately wounded survivors of the Iraqi insurgency, the broken, decimated families of the Shias and Kurds, the even greater number of executed fighters and civilians now entombed beneath the sands of Iraq by Saddam's killers--were not part of Cheney's 'healing process.' Their catharsis was to die. They did our [US imperial] bidding. They had served their purpose. They had failed to topple Saddam. This was their fate. But 'we' had been 'healed.' Bush [Sr.] had called for the overthrow of Saddam and then said he never intended to help the rebels in their struggle. An Associated Press report bluntly outlined the Bush policy in early April [1991]. The president, it said, 'is betting that Americans are more concerned about getting US troops back from the Gulf than helping Iraqi rebels topple Saddam Hussein.'\" - Fisk, Robert, \"The Great War For Civiliasation,\" 2005, Knopf, p. 666 (no joke).

MLs (at least of the contemporary variety) do not have this requirement, as their ideal world is one that is stateless, classless and moneyless. the problem comes from their praxis of murdering political enemies, strengthening the state and building forced labor camps en masse. the thing is, their praxis can change, and their core values don't inherently *require* evil things on their own. \n\nso basically, MLs have messed up praxis and that definitely isn't okay but they aren't inherently evil the way that fascists are. their evilness can be changed because the core values of most contemporary MLs are compatible with communism and therefore equality whereas the values of fascists are not.

In the book, Zinn presented a different side of history from what he considered to be the more traditional \"fundamental nationalist glorification of country.\" Zinn, while providing a limited biography but no citations, portrays a side of American history that can largely be seen as the exploitation and manipulation of the majority by rigged systems that hugely favor a small aggregate of elite rulers from across the orthodox political parties.\n\nA People's History has been assigned as reading in many high schools and colleges across the United States.

America at the time did give people a lot more freedoms than most simply because it was one of few governments that gave the people a huge sense of power. Whether that was real or not is up in the air but people did have freedoms. At the time, the US was probably the most forward government in terms of human rights and equal treatment (between white people) alongside having a government that was represented by each person. It's why it took a very long time for the Great Compromise to even occur as it dealt with how each state can represent themselves. Nowadays, you can definitely make a case that the US is behind everybody else.\n\nStill if you had a choice between the British empire and the American government, one that demanded loyalty to the monarchy and the other that at least let you have a gun and the ability to participate in politics, then I'd probably choose the dad that is a controlling dick that sometimes gives me ice cream instead of the one that is controlling and is fucking pissed that his son is out of his hands and is talking to that French fuck.","created_utc":1523211856,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I don't know if being apathetic is all that different from posting revolutionary calls to action on the internet, the end result is the same. \n\nThe groups that were of serious concern to the U.S. were those that didn't just talk, didn't just remain within their small communities, but those that worked to physically build a revolutionary class consciousness and undermine the power of the state and capital. The Black Panthers were severely targeted by Hoover and others because it was obvious that they had both the theoretical and practical ability to create real change. So what were they doing? They weren't just talking about socialism, they were living it. They created mutual-aid communities that fed the poor, offered education, health clinics, protection, etc. They actively engaged with the community and used this network of mutual aid to radicalize people and grow a movement. \n\nIf you are serious about revolution, as we must be, get out in the actual world and be a apart of something larger.

No matter how progressive and leftist they may seem, they are part of the problem.\n\nTo get around this, look at how organizations in the past have gotten around this. For example, IWW focuses on labor but their ultimate goal is to abolish capitalism. \n\nMy advice, start organizing around one thing that coincides with your ultimate goals. Maybe start by feeding people in need but frame it as capitalism has left behind groups of people who need to be fed. Focus on attacking capitalism as being the cause of this problem and offer a solution. Continue to organize around this topic and give the outward appearance that you are for that one issue. \n\nOnce you have your organization started, you can start to branch out. For instance, when people start organizing around issues in education, you can stand with them and introduce your problem of food availability among children in the districts you're operating in. Start talking about how the power structures that keep people hungry also create education inequality. \n\nAlso, be leery of working with anyone involved with democratic groups or international liberal organizations, as they probably won't see eye to eye with your end goals.

If I may, I want to discuss your praxis, specifically, \n\n&gt;The Tower is an openly anarchist project that from its inception has promoted ideals of mutual aid and solidarity, equality, and community autonomy, as well as direct action, class war, and fighting back. Our politics have always included both gardens and riots. We want to see people building beautiful alternatives of liberation, just as much as we want to see people attacking structures of domination.\n\nFirst and foremost, I don't think many would object to the sentiment in its vaguest sense. But, I am still not convinced that planned violence is a viable strategy. And suggesting that riots are \"the praxis of the [Tower]\" implies things (need say no more on that subject). This is how you get raided. And, in my view riots are little more than a letting off of steam. Their rage can be leveraged toward revolutionary activity, but I wouldn't call rioting revolutionary activity in themselves. Riots are a symptom of social disease. You might as well plan a sneeze.\n\nI don't mean to moralize the issue. Riots are the state's problem, not mine. And I'm certainly not advocating hippie bullshit, either. This is a matter of strategy. And, in my view, I think we have to start thinking about creating community assemblies and taking over local politics.

But I live in Sweden where our prison system is already heavily steered towards rehabilitation and where any punishment is less about retribution and more about deterring antisocial behavior. (This is not to say that it cannot be more oriented towards rehabilitation; indeed, this is what I already advocate.)\n\nCertainly, ensuring that everybody have a decent economic and social life will certainly mitigate antisocial behavior, as much antisocial behavior stems from different kinds of insecurities.  But I reckon that even if we create a good foundation for everybody's welfare, that it would still be impossible to entirely eradicate the presence of individuals who are less concerned with caring about their fellow beings and who are willing to harm others.\n\nSo what exactly do you want to do with those who act antisocially, harm others or their personal or communal property, and who are unwilling to express regret and change their behavior? If you are going to place them in some form of institution, what exactly would make it any different than a (e.g. Swedish) prison in anything but name?\n\nIf an option would be banishment from a community, then I am not certain if *I* would support such a notion about a serious norm violator.

Fuck those who can only care about something if it's related to class.\n\nThis is a backwards approach and plays right into the hands of those who push the whole \"lgbt existence = decadence\" narrative (which is not anything new, by the way).

But it is the very existence of the narrative that's the problem, not the class relations itself. Stalin didn't give a shit either when he joined hands with the orthodox church to illegalise homosexuality, because it was bourgeois decadence. It didn't matter then that homosexuals were mostly working class, they'll just claim that they're imitating bourgeois decadence so that's sufficient, so it won't matter now if trans people are mostly working class either.

The reason for these things to exist is simply because they already do, and to change what is now on any other degree than what you have direct control over, what is your own actions, is to apply some form of anti anarchic approach which I deem to be an enemy of freedom! It is not that what I'm saying is wrong it is that I'm saying what I view as a logical way to live life, a natural way to live life, and that while your opinion is valid, it is only valid in a world where authority and control is under the assumption of either a single human or a single human philosophy, conformist or authoritarian!\n\nThe difference between killing a rapist and letting a rapist commit the rape is that  you intervened in one and is directly responsible for the loss of freedom, in the other you simply lived your life to your best ability, such as you do right now while hundreds or thousands or possibly hundreds of thousands of rapes and murders are committed this very day! To intervene is to be nothing short of law enforcement, only now you assume your subjective approach to what is ok and what should be instead of going through any sort of legislative process which at the very least demands some level of compromise.","created_utc":1523363616,"score":0,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

His depiction of the police in The wire, while complex and fascinating is still no doubt symphatetic to the police, even tho the BPD have time and time again been proven to be a despicable bunch of bastards,m with Freddie Gray and the squads who were carrying around toy guns to plant on shot victims. The wire never blamed the people but rather the bueorocracy and structures.\n\nMy guess is that he will have a focus on the Abraham Lincoln brigade throughout the war, depicting the idealistic start in Madrid, the ideological diversity of the volunteer Americans and the slow decent into low intensity civil war on the republican side. My guess is he is going to put too much blame on the communists and the Soviet union and not enough on the liberals in the Republican government as he is one himself.\n\n\nI'm mad at the mere idea, but still, if any American were to do this David Simon is probably the best established TV series creator who could have been chosen.\n\nEDIT: this is a quote from David Simon that makes me mildly optimistic\n\n&gt; \u201cwhen the Spanish Republic was threatened, capitalism chose tyranny.

{"author":"AutumnLeavesCascade","body":"In the words of George Barrett in \"The Anarchist Revolution\" (1920):  \n  \n&gt;\"The fact is, the Government is simply the executive committee of the ruling class. Taxation is its principle source of finance. The landlords and capitalists are those for whom it keeps the land and means of production, and prevents the producers from taking possession. If instead of the present capitalist class there were a set of officials appointed by the Government and set in a position to control our factories, it would bring about no revolutionary change. The officials would have to be paid, and we may depend that, in their privileged positions, they would expect good remuneration. The politicians would have to be paid, and we already know their tastes. You would, in fact, have a nonproductive class dictating to the producers the conditions upon which they were allowed to make use of the means of production. As this is exactly what is wrong with the present system of society, we can see that State control would be no remedy, while it would bring with it a host of new troubles.  \n  \n&gt;It cannot be too clearly understood that any system of Government control \u2014 that is, any system except Anarchism \u2014 can at the best do nothing better than enforce the politician\u2019s ideal of society upon the people. For example, let us suppose an absolutely ideal Socialist State, where all the Members of Parliament are in agreement, and where their only object is the welfare of society. As a Government, or an executive committee, or an administrative body, or whatever they called themselves, it will be agreed, I think, that they undertake two chief duties. The one is to see that the necessities of life are supplied, and the other is to ensure that the workers shall have proper conditions under which to produce. Now let us suppose that a section of the workers disagree with the Government as to what are proper conditions (for the worker sees the factory from a slightly different point of view from the politician). What takes place? The politicians, we will say, refuse to grant these conditions, which seem to them unfair. This section of the workers consequently come out on strike. They are successful up to the point of causing a serious shortage of the commodity which they produce. The politicians are responsible for the supply of this commodity, and they cannot allow the whole community to suffer because of the (to them) unreasonable action of an extremist minority. The inevitable conclusion is that the strikers must be forced back into their factories.  \n  \n&gt;Surely from this it is evident that under a governmental system of society, whether it is the capitalism of to-day or a more perfected Government control of the Socialist State, the essential relationship between the governed and the governing, the worker and the controller, will be the same; and this relationship so long as it lasts can be maintained only by the bloody brutality of the policeman\u2019s bludgeon and the soldier\u2019s rifle.  \n  \n&gt;You cannot put new wine into old bottles. The institutions of the present society, based upon the subjection of the workers, must be thrown aside, for they will not hold the spirit of liberty which will compose the new society.  \n  \n&gt;If we wanted further proof than that furnished by the logic of the position, it would be found in that question so often levelled at the Anarchist: What would you do with the man who would not work? The implication is, of course, that the questioner, a Governmentalist, and generally a Socialist, has a method of dealing with him. What can such a method be, which the Anarchist has not also, except force? Is not the striker one of the most important of the men who will not work? And is not the question, therefore, an admission that force will be brought to bear on the discontented, to compel them to occupy their proper position in society?  \n  \n&gt;Certain it is that to-day the capitalist is compelled to bring out the soldiers and force his slaves back to work; but it is no more certain than the fact that in all societies where there is a central controlling force the same means must be used to crush the rebellious.  \n  \n&gt;That is why we are Anarchists.\"  ","created_utc":1523414478,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"WikiTextBot","body":"**Anarcho-syndicalism**\n\nAnarcho-syndicalism (also referred to as revolutionary syndicalism) is a theory of anarchism that views revolutionary industrial unionism or syndicalism as a method for workers in capitalist society to gain control of an economy and, with that control, influence broader society. Syndicalists consider their economic theories a strategy for facilitating worker self-activity and as an alternative co-operative economic system with democratic values and production centered on meeting human needs.\n\nThe basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are solidarity, direct action (action undertaken without the intervention of third parties such as politicians, bureaucrats, and arbitrators) and direct democracy, or workers' self-management. The end goal of syndicalism is to abolish the wage system, regarding it as wage slavery.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1523440143,"score":15,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"SirBrendantheBold","body":"One of the most important things to remember when discussing anti-fascism with liberals or moderates is controlling the dialogue so it doesn't veer into the cerebral absurd. People like to posture and pontificate-- I should know. And often we get so wrapped up in ideological nuance and high-roading that we also forget that we're talking about real things with real effects. So when engaging with those opposed but not bigoted, there a few useful things to drag the dialogue back to.\n\nHate crime rates have soared in the developed world. Their hate doesn't stop at their speech but translates into dead young men and women, not in some hypothetical future but right now in our cities and towns. We aren't just shutting down some future fascist takeover; we're trying to stifle the movement that is already here. There doesn't need to be state-operated genocide for there to be an unacceptable level of violence. \n\nFor the classic 'freedom of speech' argument, we have to appreciate what that phrase and freedom actually mean. 'Freedom' is freedom from, no one gives you the freedom to do anything but yourself except others can harm or suppress your ability to do so. So when we talk about promoting freedom we're really talking about the freedom to do a thing while feeling safe and secure in the doing. When you have thousands of people chanting phrases so fucking grotesque that I won't even repeat them about calling for the death of identifiable minorities, somehow the supposed free-speech crowd can't make the miraculous connection to how that might make those minorities feel unsafe in exercising their own freedoms and speech. It's pretty ridiculous to expect a person to feel comfortable attending or speaking at their university when the day before hundreds had gathered to scream that they represented an existential threat that must be put down with extreme prejudice. \n\nI realise this is something, I hope, everyone on this sub is already sensitive to but I just though this'd be a good spot to remind comrades of some simple talking points to bring good-hearted but misguided liberals back to reality.

How could mankind ever hope to colonize another planet or leave this solar system if we can't even figure out how to use our own planet? An end to countries would also mean an end to war between humans, since most wars are started for nationalistic\/rescource reasons, like one nation wanting to conquer part of another nation, or one nation wanting anothers oil, etc.  Nations are only holding humanity back, really we need to abolish them. However, we can never abolish nations if we cannot get rid of nationalism, which promotes fear and hatred to people that are really your kin. Nationalism is not in the interest of you or me or the people who live in a country, it only benifits the rulers of a country, who use nationalism to make the people angry and defensive, thus helping the ruling class get even tighter control over a country.

Older anarcho-punk (Crass, Conflict) is also pretty great.\n\nAlso Crimethinc., who does a lot of really good podcast work and is pretty influential here in the US, got its start producing a hardcore punk zine. \n\nPersonally I wouldn't be an anarchist without Wingnut Dishwasher's Union. Music is one of our strongest cultural artifacts, and a shit ton of radicals get their start in DIY music scenes.\n\nRight now it seems like we're shifting a lot of focus towards underground hip-hop (Sub.media releases anarchist and leftist hip-hop mixtapes online which are really fucking good), which I feel is a vital addition to our cultural horizon. Despite decades of attempts to make punk inclusive (often half-assed, often resisted by privileged scenesters who like their punk un-political) its still really fucking white, folk-punk especially (though punk is pretty good about centering GSRM folks nowadays; personally my local music scene is queer as hell). Also there's a lot of toxicity in punk that rightfully turns a lot of folks off. There's also some anarchist black metal around (Iskra and some anticiv folks like Leper and Storm of Sedition), but metal is pretty fashy in general.

There are meaningful parallels to colonialism, but because it\u2019s not a 1 to 1 relationship, I won\u2019t rely upon the analogy. Plain and simple, people moving into a community and, without  deep knowledge of their neighbors cultural practices nor having a strong social footing within that community, using the local communities police force, zoning enforcement, etc. to enforce you\u2019re own personal set of values, is an act of aggression and is one important way that the early stages of gentrification become oppressive of the historical populations there. Asking your neighbor to mow the lawn is very different from using the law to bully someone into doing labor they have no interest in for your own economic benefit (increasing your own property value). However, this demonstrates how outsiders moving into communities with a long history of noncooperation with the police can get innocent working people killed.

It should also be mentioned that the slogan of \"die yuppie scum\" was even raised against gentrification and still these areas were gentrified. Also unless revolutionaries are ready to go beyond the level of individual resistance and being rude to hipsters, and perhaps organize anti-hipster fighting units\/squads, then we can't really assault gentrification and the capitalists through individualized resistance but organized resistance and turn it into revolution.\n\nWhen it comes to the process of gentrification and the problem of housing in capitalism overall, there are many class interests that are the primary beneficiaries and the leaders of gentrifying a given area. We have to organize the proletariat and the people against the capitalist class who come in the form of, big private property owners, and other real estate interests\/developers, along with the bourgeoisie state apparatus which violently defends them. Keeping in mind the long term economic and political interests in overthrowing capitalism of the proletariat, along with other classes and social strata, while having an analysis of the political economy of capitalism can help us really fix the problem.","created_utc":1523551984,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

That means that if a server gets stiffed on a tip, they literally just paid to take care of a table.\n\nIt is also incorrect in saying the back of house people are getting parts of the tip.  Generally, people that are unseen to the restaurant guests are not getting tips.

My university is \"blocked\", meaning no one can access it, because there is a new law here in France (that is already in action) that basically makes going to public university a bit more difficult.

Also, it's finals week.\n\nSo a lot of students (including myself, although I'm on another campus no nbd) are pissed and tried to go the next general assembly. But each time they were trying to talk in the microphone, they were rudely interrupted or forced to get off the stage. When came the vote to continue the blockade or not, they allowed (again) a lot of people form outside the university to vote, so of course they won and now it's gonna last 2 weeks. So undemocratic.\n\nApart from that, they've created a sort of independent town in the campus, and from the few photos I've seen, it looks wack but nice. But on the other hand, I've heard of dogs pissing and shitting everywhere, armed antifa who forbid you from taking pictures, garbage everywhere, etc.\n\nThe thing is, student government in itself is a good idea, but in practice, it's a small group of individuals who know the majority of students don't really care about what they do as long as it doesn't prevent them from getting their degree.

Ban private, home, and parochial schooling so that everyone has equal access to secular information growing up, in a place where the Bill of Rights applies, and everyone has a stake in the system and a reason to see it succeed--watch poor failing \"inner city\" schools do a 180 over night when parents with real money, connections, and resources have kids there.\n\nEnd grades, homework, mandatory attendance, tracking, and funding tied to high stakes testing. Requiring students to pass a test, write a paper, or complete a project to participate in certain higher level labs or classes with limited resources would still be reasonable. Offer all kinds of educational resources to students at their own pace: free public lectures, labs, kitchens, tool shops, datacenters, music studios, field research and experiments in cities and natural areas, etc. Let people learn whatever they are curious about, without forcing all kinds of busy work on them and without constantly evaluating their compliance and enforcing their obedience.\n\nAuthoritarians of all varieties will object and point to kids who would get left behind, too lazy or distracted to ever bother to learn fundamental skills on their own.  However, those objecting ignore that those same \"left behind\" kids fail in the current system. In a more free and open environment, there is at least the chance that some subject will pique their interest and that once they get engaged, they will realize that they also need basic reading\/writing\/math\/socialization if they expect to succeed in the field.

I live in Texas, and I'm not saying I support or dislike this system, but the way tipping works in Texas is not necessarily the same as other states. In Texas, servers can be paid $2.13, and the business they work for can establish a portion of their tips to go to a tip share but ONLY for other people in the restaurant performing jobs that contribute to service. Now service isn't clearly defined as far as I know, but the idea is that the host that seats a table, or the food-runner that brings food out to the table and has interaction with the customers can receive a portion of tip share, while the cook who prepares the food or the dishwasher who cleans the plates can't because a lack of interaction with the customer precluding them being included as assisting in \"service.\" But another state may have radically different rules regarding tip share, which is why talking about the U.S. as if tipping rules are homogeneous doesn't really work.\n\n3. Here in rural\/outer urban Texas, I have seen multiple business try the \"we're a non-tipping establishment.\" Only one has made it past the first year. It isn't their fault, though: the fact is, customers don't consider how much they tip when they are comparing in their head prices. These places pay all their employees a living wage, and as a result, have higher prices, and as a result, get horrid reviews based on how \"expensive\" they are. It's not okay, it's not right, but unless all the businesses in your area are doing something similar, your restaurant will always appear to be more expensive. To get every local business to adopt no-tipping policies could very well be possible, but the fact that in the U.S. every small town has fast-casual chains and franchises that would never use that format acts as an impossible roadblock to that course of action.\n\n4. Full disclaimer for myself, I do work in the restaurant industry. I personally have very mixed feelings about tipping as it applies to my life. On the one hand, last Saturday I worked a double shift, the tips from which will cover my expenses for over half a month. That's pretty great. In January, I could work all week and barely break even, and that sucks. With that in mind, I still would not want to see the restaurant at which I work adopt a no-tipping policy because that puts into jeopardy my place of work, and I definitely prefer working there as opposed to a chain or franchise. I'm an anarchist, I support the destruction of capitalism, but as long as I exist within it having an income, even if it is variable, is better than not having one.\n\n5. I definitely disagree with the author that tipping is difficult. I'm not going to tell anyone else how they should tip, but personally I do 20% as a baseline, I'll go significantly over (often) if my waiter was awesome, and I would only ever go below 20% if the waiter did something incredibly egregious like visibly and personally spit in my food, or called me \"faggot,\" or something, in which case I'd probably just leave enough cash to cover the price and leave the restaurant without looking at the check anyway.\n\nSo I guess what I'm trying to say is this: tipping, as a system, definitely has issues, but if small businesses reject it, from my experience it makes them that much more noncompetitive with larger corporations that already have an advantage, which means the people working at small businesses (which I know aren't at all perfect and free of abuse, but I do believe are, in many cases, better than corporations) have their livelihoods put in jeopardy and often lose their jobs and are forced to move to similar but worse positions and corporate run restaurants, which are often less understanding of individual workers' needs and more often have toxic work environments.\n\nIt's a system that definitely benefits people who own private property in the long run, and is thus one of the worse parts of capitalism. However, I'm not trying to get rid of it for this author because he's uncomfortable he's obligated to tip, anymore than I'm trying to dismantle patriarchy because a man feels uncomfortable he's obligated to hold the door open for women.","created_utc":1523570669,"score":4,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

We've all seen pic of old ladies getting peppersprayed and heard of cases where students get fined a huge amount of money.  If those cases reach the media its a really bad look for the police\/private security etc. . So they mostly try to avoid those situations. \n\nWhat the saying refers to is in my opinion the intent of the protest and the way it is communicated with the state.\n\nOne example: In Vienna there is a traditional demonstration against a rightwinged meeting\/prom where every year fash from all over europe and the world meet. \\(Akademikerball\\). Every year the goal of the demonstration is to block the fash from entering the building. So 3 \\(?\\) years ago \\(#nowkr 2015\/14???\\) there was a really radical group of people who organized the protests. Most of these people fled from austria and now chill at some beach in Latin america from what you hear because they were charged with biiig fines and jailtime. \n\nThe next year the young socialist party \\(SJ\\) and the young Green party \\(Junge Gr\u00fcne \\- RIP\\) took over where the previous guys left. Of course they are known by name and hence they could not organise the same kind of violent protest like before. Which pissed of other more left groups because the basically made a deal with the police to give them the location of the demonstrations in advance. The police was able to escort the participants of the meeting to the location while the demonstration failed its purpose.\n\nFollowing those events demonstrations now are mostly organised by anonymous groups so that the liberty of doing the kind of protest you want doesn't get lost anymore. \n\nI really do not want to discredit anybody protesting in their own way, and you have to decide whether how far you want to go and how much you are willing to risk.

{"author":"Prince_of_Loch_Ness","body":"I wondered if you were a troll, but it seems more likely that you are a good demonstation of the dunning-kruger effect.\n\nI'm sure you are an authorative voice on anarchism, after seeing some zesty memes, buying a flag off amazon, and shouting at your mum, but consider that you may not know that much.\n\nwe are talking fundemental principles here, which you don't understand.\n\n\"When I came to realize the faults, failings, shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the management of all its affairs, with all their manifold deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite man, to be managed by the party which happened to come into power, and therefore was the majority party, nor did it ten, nor does it now make one particle of difference to me what a party, out of power may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of a party, when entrenched and securely seated in power might do to crush opposition, and silence the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward step of progress.\n\nMy mind is appalled at the thought of a political party having control of all the details that go to make up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an instant, that the party in power shall have all authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be used in our schools and universities, government officials editing, printing, and circulating our literature, histories, magazines and press, to say nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that a people engage in, in a civilized society.\n\nTo my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great and the few steps we have gained have been won at too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people of this 20th century to consent to turn over to any political party the management of our social and industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with history know that men will abuse power when they possess it, for these and other reasons, I, after careful study, and not through sentiment, turned from a sincere, earnest, political Socialist to the non-political phase of Socialism, Anarchism, because in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper conditions for the fullest development of the individual units in society, which can never be the case under government restrictions.\n\nThe philosophy of anarchism is included in the word \"Liberty\"; yet it is comprehensive enough to include all things else that are conducive to progress. No barriers whatever to human progression, to thought, or investigation are placed by anarchism; nothing is considered so true or so certain, that future discoveries may not prove it false; therefore, it has but one infallible, unchangeable motto, \"Freedom.\" Freedom to discover any truth, freedom to develop, to live naturally and fully. Other schools of thought are composed of crystallized ideas-principles that are caught and impaled between the planks of long platforms, and considered too sacred to be disturbed by a close investigation. In all other \"issues\" there is always a limit; some imaginary boundary line beyond which the searching mind dare not penetrate, lest some pet idea melt into a myth. But anarchism is the usher of science-the master of ceremonies to all forms of truth. It would remove all barriers between the human being and natural development. From the natural resources of the earth, all artificial restrictions, that the body might be nurtures, and from universal truth, all bars of prejudice and superstition, that the mind may develop symmetrically.\n\nAnarchists know that a long period of education must precede any great fundamental change in society, hence they do not believe in vote begging, nor political campaigns, but rather in the development of self-thinking individuals.\n\nWe look away from government for relief, because we know that force (legalized) invades the personal liberty of man, seizes upon the natural elements and intervenes between man and natural laws; from this exercise of force through governments flows nearly all the misery, poverty, crime and confusion existing in society.\"\n\nlucy parsons","created_utc":1523656360,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Is Raddle a pro-Nazi project just because fascists can run their own fork of it?\n\nTo some extent, sure. However, those examples are very different from a federated social network. While WordPress gives fascists the ability to easily deploy a website, that website is largely siloed. Deploying a wordpress site doesn't give you access to huge social network and platform, it just gives you access to whoever happens to navigate to wherever that content is hosted. To actually get people to navigate to that location, you need some sort of outreach beyond that siloed wordpress instance.\n\nA federated social network is different. Yes, fascists need to pay for their own hosting, but that's trivial. I pay $5 a month for a VPS, anyone can come up with that, never mind upper middle class New England white boys and well funded Russian trolls. What they get access to for $5\/month isn't just a simple static collection of pages that are easy to keep up to date and make pretty. They receive tools for organizing and reaching people.\n\nAnd while you can block content from a Mastodon instance and block users who use that instance, that's not really any different from the social networks we have today.

I don't think there is an easy solution, and I don't think open source and federated systems address the hate speech issue on social networks. We have an economy that consolidates control of resources into the hands of a few people and assess the value of online platforms according to their ability to datamine and serve ads effectively. Maybe there's something about that which is just fundamentally inescapably rotten. Moving to a decentralized platform is essentially suggesting that we remove the human directive element from playing a role in crafting what the online experience is. I understand why that reaction is attractive, but it doesn't actually address the issues at hand, it just creates its own problems.\n\nThere's something fundamentally human about conflict, anger, hatred... but capitalism exasperates those aspects of the human condition and burns away the social safe guards we would use to maintain a pleasant social system. To a certain extent the alien and amplifying nature of the Internet may make this inescapable, but would it really be as bad as it is now if Reddit was administrated by a collective of volunteers who make most of their money from donations? You know, like Reddit was originally at the very beginning of the monetization cycle? As most of these social network bedroom projects tend to start?\n\nBut of course, there's no turning back the will of capitalism, and even if that was accomplished, like I mentioned, these are still incredibly alien platforms which provide their own set of social conundrums independent of the political-economic system they emerge in.\n\nMaybe the best we can do is create bonds and autonomous infrastructure with real people in real life.","created_utc":1523734196,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

The camp was active for 19 years and disbanded in 2000.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1523751551,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Of course seemingly apolitical veganism is just consumer colonial bullshit. \n\nif you want to get all smartypants about it, and bring Beyonce into it: \"This article explores the way vegan and vegetarian diets have been articulated within neo-liberal post-feminist culture. While these diets have an important role for vegetarian eco-feminists, as signs of resistance against the patriarchal and capitalist exploitative system, in post-feminism they have become sexy and business oriented. This shift is analyzed through the case study of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s involvement with the commercial enterprise \u201c22 days,\u201d a dietary regime that involves the elimination of any animal product for 22 days. Our argument is that while eco-feminists have embraced vegetarian and vegan regimes as ethical and political choices, post-feminism depoliticizes and deradicalizes them. In this way, they become part of an individualistic project that emphasizes empowerment and meritocracy; choice, agency, and responsibilization; and the focus on a healthy, sexy body. Ultimately, the post-feminist articulation of vegan diets promotes a form of \u201ccommodity veg*ism,\u201d that is not only devoid of any critical force, but also reproduces existing patterns of discrimination and inequality. We use the term veg*ism to indicate the fluid uptake of vegan and vegetarian diets, whereby the avoidance of animal products relies more on an individual than on ethical and\/or political choice.\" \n\nhttps:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/full\/10.1080\/14680777.2017.1358200?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true","created_utc":1523762548,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"DenverHoxha","body":"&gt;The first thing to note from the three major mobilisations of the western \u2018anti-war\u2019 left is that they have little to do with ending the war. More than half a million Syrians have been killed since 2011. The vast majority of civilian deaths have been through the use of conventional weapons and 94 per cent of these victims were killed by the Syrian-Russian-Iranian alliance. There is no outrage or concern feigned for this war, which followed the regime\u2019s brutal crackdown on peaceful, pro-democracy demonstrators. There\u2019s no outrage when barrel bombs, chemical weapons and napalm are dropped on democratically self-organized communities or target hospitals and rescue workers. Civilians are expendable; the military capabilities of a genocidal, fascist regime are not. In fact the slogan \u2018Hands off Syria\u2019 really means \u2018Hands off Assad\u2019 and support is often given for Russia\u2019s military intervention. This was evident yesterday at a demonstration organized by Stop the War UK where a number of regime and Russian flags were shamefully on display.\n\nFucking this. \n\n&gt;The other major political trend to have thrown its weight behind the Assad regime and organize against US, UK and French strikes on Syria is the far right. Today, the discourse of fascists and these \u2018anti-imperialist leftists\u2019 is virtually indistinguishable. In the US, white supremacist Richard Spencer, alt right podcaster Mike Enoch and anti-immigration activist Ann Coulter are all opposing US strikes. In the UK former BNP leader Nick Griffin and Islamophobe Katie Hopkins join the calls. The place where the alt-right and alt-left frequently converge is around promoting various conspiracy theories to absolve the regime of its crimes. They claim chemical massacres are false flags or that rescue workers are Al Qaeda and therefore legitimate targets for attack. Those spreading such reports are not on the ground in Syria and are unable to independently verify their claims. They are often dependent on Russian or Assad state propaganda outlets because they \u2018don\u2019t trust the MSM\u2019 or Syrians directly affected. Sometimes the convergence of these two seemingly opposite strands of the political spectrum turns into outright collaboration. The ANSWER coalition, which is organizing many of the demonstrations against a strike on Assad in the US, has such a history. Both strands frequently promote Islamophobic and anti-Semitic narratives. Both share the same talking points and same memes.\n\nAlso fucking this. \n\n&gt;There are many valid reasons for opposing external military intervention in Syria, whether it be by the US, Russia, Iran or Turkey. None of these states are acting in the interests of the Syrian people, democracy or human rights. They act solely in their own interests. The US, UK and French intervention today is less about protecting Syrians from mass-atrocity and more about enforcing an international norm that chemical weapons use is unacceptable, lest one day they be used on westerners themselves. More foreign bombs will not bring about peace and stability. There\u2019s little appetite to force Assad from power which would contribute to ending the worst of the atrocities.  Yet in opposing foreign intervention, one needs to come up with an alternative to protect Syrians from slaughter. It\u2019s morally objectionable to say the least to expect Syrians to just shut up and die to protect the higher principle of \u2018anti-imperialism\u2019. \n\nBut especially fucking this.

I think the only place we're butting heads is over the framing of the conversation- which is a good thing to discuss because how we talk about these issues is important. I just want to state that I understand that there are myriad angles to view the conflicts in the mid east from and I'm genuinely not trying to engage in reductionism. These are very complex issues. I don't think that means they can't be talked about. A forum like this isn't the best medium for it, obviously, but hey here we are. \n\nBut that framing of the conversation is important because when the situation *is* so complex and there are so many \"factual distinctions\" that could be raised about the conflict, it becomes everyone's responsibility to ask ourselves which facts are relevant to mention and what way bringing those facts into the fore shifts the viewing angle. \n\nWhen the parent comment to this thread brings up these facts: \"The Iraq war killed millions\", \"the invasion of Iraq was poorly executed by design\" (debatable, obviously, but we'll let it slide), \"the bombing of Syria targeted buildings,\" and \"Assad is a mass-murdering dictator\", it should seem obvious to anyone reading that the author's intent was to use specific facts to frame the bombings in a positive light by comparing them to a much more severe situation even though the OP was trying to point out that none of the US presidents of the modern era are without blood on their hands, even the ones who were not directly responsible for our declaration of war in Iraq specifically. \n\nMy original response was an attempt to point this out in a concise way. Because while there are many facts about the world that anyone could point out about a given situation, politics itself is an exercise in deciding which facts to deem relevant and which are not as important. \n\nI would argue the fact \"every modern US president has used their power to intact militaristic imperialism in the middle east\" is a much more important fact than \"Trump has been directly responsible for the deaths of less people in the middle east than Bush by a vast margin\".","created_utc":1523801797,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Jouissance_juice","body":"&gt;Objectivism is not Objective. \n\nOkay. So you are going to try to attack these axioms by using them to create contradictions. Every system of axioms contains contradictions, even mathematics, and Ayn Rand is a pseud so this should be fun. I also don't know why you are leaving out the 3rd axiom because it's the fucking worst one. It's the weakest and the most damning, basically you shouldn't feel bad for being really really shitty, if being shitty maximizes  1 and 2.\n\n&gt;All living entities hold the maintenance of one's own life as the ultimate standard of value, to which all lesser goals are the means\n\nLiving things want to be alive\n\n&gt;Because all living entities hold the maintenance of one's own life as the ultimate standard of value, this value is prescriptive as well as descriptive\n\nLiving things are gonna do things to be alive\n\n&gt;Man's conscious is volitional. Man relies on conceptual values, although these are not automatically obtained; it requires critical thinking;\n\nLiving things shouldn't feel bad about doing things that sustain their  life.\n\nSo, first of all, these axioms don't extend beyond an extremely brutal version of life. Now you can talk about Freud's Death Drive, which destroys point 1 and 2 so you might want to look into it. But instead, the second half of axiom 1 is problematic. \"To which all lesser goals are the means\". So basically, everything I do is based on my will  to survive. Why do people take risks at all? Why question authority, when questioning authority will bring certain peril? The argument is that people only act on their own survival instinct, but some things are more important than life. Dignity, community, future outcomes for others we won't even meet. Look at the civil rights movement, at the end Dr. King *knew* he would be assassinated, it was only a question of when. NTM all of the men and women who were killed, beaten, harassed, marginalized and otherwise put through hell, for what?! The right to vote? And I add this because an argument could be made that Dr. King did it for fame or whatever, (this is highly cynical and yucky) but many people were martyred for their movement whose names will be\/have been forgotten. And you can say the same about apartheid or whatever, same thing. It was a higher calling, to act on behalf of the welfare of others, despite the personal risks to life and we'll being that created real lasting change for the better in everybody's life, not just Black Americans.\n\nAnd not to Godwin an argument, but what is a good example of people acquiescing to a regime for selfish reasons? The fucking holocaust. The majority, acting in the best interest of them selves, their own survival prospects (because any violent regime carries the threat of violence against all of its citizens, so get in line.) An appeal to the lowest orders of human cognition, to which these axioms *specifically address.* oh and by the way, no-one should feel bad about it because they were acting on behalf of their own self interest.\n\nWas Ayn Rand responsible for the holocaust? Yes (no she wasn't I'm joking). But she is a relic of all of the problems of late modernism, an  apologist for its disasters. And now we live in an age of nostalgia where the grand narratives of modernism are quite appealing. But her whole premise is WHACK. Everyone should act in their own best interest is inherently SUBJECTIVE. It's doublespeak.","created_utc":1523831436,"score":6,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Understanding Rawls and other modern political theories will help you engage with people from other perspectives. Try to understand where people come from so you can best know how to speak to them. This may not seem like direct action as much, but it is meaningful if you can change minds or at least make people curious. Don't alienate or try to be right - listen and learn, and ask questions. Genuine, curious questions should be enough for leading any conversation the right direction. Assertion and challenge will just create boundaries and be counterproductive. Remember anarchism applies to all humans - no hierarchy among people, and that means people you don't agree with. Many anarchists get so caught up in resistance that they forget that the root of anarchism is not in smashing the state but in mutual aid and cooperation among people. \n\nWhen I was in high school there were clubs for gay rights advocacy, so you could see if there are any activist clubs or organizations at your high school (as another example, sometimes there are environmentalist clubs).\n\nAs others have mention, switch to Linux and learn to use open source technology (e.g. [Linux command line](https:\/\/nostarch.com\/tlcl)). Contribute to free and open source tech (even simple work like fielding bugs or writing documentation) and contribute in other projects as you can, e.g. transcribing written works to digital text and making them public, reading for librivox to make books accessible by audio, etc. You can try to reach out to Audible Anarchist and help read for them too.\n\nAs others have said, prepare your body as well as your mind - learn and practice Krav Maga, exercise regularly (good habits you will need as you get older - not exercising isn't a choice for long in life; avoiding it leads to serious health problems). \n\nAlso as others have asserted: apply the values of anarchism to your life - treat others as equals. Catch yourself when you are creating hierarchy (even in small ways). Build sensitivity, and learn to cooperate rather than lead or pressure. These are hard things to do, they require self-awareness and effort.

In other regards, he comes to very similar conclusions as leftists, but draws vastly different solutions. He kind of just goes with the flow, as long as it is labeled conservative. He'd most certainly go with fascism if it became the trend like 1930s Wiemar.\n\nHe's still my dad, and I try dropping tidbits of leftism without being so obvious about it. But frankly, my right wing family is probably a lost cause. It's really difficult, because they're people I would not only not want to associate with, but would quite violently reject if they weren't family. I try to avoid talk of politics around my right wing family. Even my uncle once half jokingly said to my dad \"how'd your kids become so librul?\" Ya know, the guy who's been laid off multiple times by shitty companies. I think my only saving grace is they know that I'm not worth arguing with about it, so they rarely try to start anything. It's not like I'm great at arguing, but I'm way more politically informed than they are, because they really don't have a care to stay informed. And I won't even get into it about my mother.

And this \"peace\" will only be upheld as long as this neoliberal and sectarian regime continues to exert total control over the society, as it did before the war. What kind of communist would think this peace is at all worth preserving?\n\n&gt; It is the responsability of the Syrian proletariat to oust Assad, and it is clear that right now they want peace and the end of fundamentalist groups making their lives even worse.\n\nThe majority of syrians do *not* want peace under Assad, and many view him and his regime as the worst actor in this conflict. Have you even talked to Syrians about this? Have you listened to what Arab anarchists have been screaming from the rooftops for the past seven years? Read about Omar aziz and Leila al-shami, or non-syrian arab commentators like budour hasan and joey ayoub (\/u\/hummusforthought).

Those who are actually involved in struggles in the region fucking *hate* assad and his regime.\n\n&gt; Westerners have absolutely no fucking legitimacy in throwing their shit in this mess for the sake of fake and hypocritical humanitarian concerns, and we should certainly not push for more illegal, racist, and imperialist involvement. \n\n100% agree, and this applies to *all* imperialist powers and foreign actors involved in syria. Curiously enough, most foreign involvement is on the side of the regime, from a large scale Russian air campaign from 2015 to Iranian support that stepped up 2013, not to mention the involvement of hezbollah and militias from iraq, and Shia jihadists from Afghanistan and pakistan.

Likewise if we then start talking about class I'm not going to think you mean the same thing by bougeois as you meant when you were talking about the rock.

The dude I replied was complaining about the possibility of a child seeing this dude burning in a park and being traumatized. This is a classic \"oh but what about the poor children, people shouldn't be able to do things like that in public!\" that is really popular among middle and upper class parents. It's not really about kids though as a group. It's about keeping the tragedies of everyday life hidden so the literal bourgeois aren't confronted with the consequences of capitalism everyday. Likewise their concern for children doesn't extend to poor children, only their own. Do you think homeless kids are sheltered from seeing bad shit? What about kids in poor countries or countries the US is actively bombing? Or kids dying from climate change induced or artificially constructed famine? \n\nNo, that kind of concern for kids extends only to the bourgeois. Seeing traumatic shit happen is part of life for everyone else and being sheltered from it is literally a bourgeois privilege. \n\nEspecially in the context of this dude specifically protesting capitalism and ecological destruction. The bourgeois in America are sheltered from ever dealing with the affects of our culture and capitalism. This man burned himself alive in a park to make that very real horror visible.

Really, by acting in such a brutal way, the state re-kindled the broader solidarity movement around the zone, which was dying\/dormant, and unified once more the occupiers (who are not all ideologically similar, have different understandings of how to go forward, etc. The zadistes aren't the main group in the zone itself tbh). Further, the state is not just dealing with the ZAD right now, but also with students occupying their universities, and a relatively broad strike by public workers, if these movements continue unifying, the state will have to concede somewhere down the line IMO.\n\nSo ya, I think there is still hope now.

Without some form of markets, dynamic resource allocation (allocation of resources towards new projects). In a decentrally-planned economy, these allocation decisions are too local and thus they can take into account more efficient uses of resources that are non-local as there is no motivation for why a commune wouldn\u2019t decide allocate those resources locally. Most communes wouldn\u2019t choose to keep informed with the best opportunities and innovative new ideas that are non-local to gift to. With central planning, there are mechanisms for resources to move from one area where they are produced to where they are most efficiently used. However, central planning suffers from information problems as well. The central planning committee simply cannot be as informed as local actors because knowledge is local and the particular context of it is local. There is a diversity of areas of study, so it seems unlikely that central planners will be able to make rational allocation decisions in all these areas while weighing all the possible local stipulations, risks and potential.

Personal choices in consumption aren't going to bring down the system, and even if you completely abstained from technology there are other things, like working a job, upholding gender norms, that also reproduce the current system. They must be tackled altogether because they are woven together in the fabric of society. At the same time, I think it's important to foster the skills and mindset to become independent so that when ruptures happen, or are made, you will not be clutching to hold onto the status quo, and one way to do that is to practice living differently as much as you can in present.\n\nFurther, I think there are a ton of problems in thinking about things in terms of sacrifice and reward and letting ideology guide your actions. It's not so different from Judeo-Christian ideas of sacrifice, the work ethic, and the ideology of Progress, and if we wish to break with this society, it's necessary to break with the thinking behind it.

{"author":"fiskiligr","body":"\"Liberal\" often means someone who supports \"capitalist representative democracy\" or \"republics.\" See *Homage to Catalonia* by George Orwell for an example of \"liberal\" being used this way. He talks about the liberal bourgeoisie who supported squelching the anarchist revolution in favor of re-instating the republic. An even better of this term comes from *[Anarcho-Syndicalism](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/rudolf-rocker-anarchosyndicalism)* by Rudolph Rocker, in which Rocker clarifies the relationship between liberalism and anarchism: \n\n&gt; Liberalism and Democracy were preeminently political concepts, and since the great majority of the original adherents of both maintained the right of ownership in the old sense, these had to renounce them both when economic development took a course which could not be practically reconciled with the original principles of Democracy, and still less with those of Liberalism. Democracy, with its motto of \u201call citizens equal before the law,\u201d and Liberalism with its \u201cright of man over his own person,\u201d both shipwrecked on the realities of the capitalist economic form. So long as millions of human beings in every country had to sell their labour-power to a small minority of owners, and to sink into the most wretched misery if they could find no buyers, the so-called \u201cequality before the law\u201d remains merely a pious fraud, since the laws are made by those who find themselves in possession of the social wealth. But in the same way there can also be no talk of a \u201cright over one\u2019s own person,\u201d for that right ends when one is compelled to submit to the economic dictation of another if he does not want to starve.\n\n&gt; Anarchism has in common with Liberalism the idea that the happiness and prosperity of the individual must be the standard of all social matters. And, in common with the great representatives of Liberal thought, it has also the idea of limiting the functions of government to a minimum. Its supporters have followed this thought to its ultimate logical consequences, and wish to eliminate every institution of political power from the life of society. When Jefferson clothes the basic concept of Liberalism in the words: \u201cthat government is best which governs least,\u201d then Anarchists say with Thoreau: \u201cThat government is best which governs not at all.\u201d\n\nI tend to agree that we should see liberals as people with some common values that we should be building bridges with and showing the light. I also agree that history shows over and over how liberals throw anarchists under the bus (just like Stalinists who call themselves Marxists, or other authoritarian communists). It doesn't help that often liberals tend to support the police in ways that really alienate anarchists and also tend to be in positions of privilege in society such that they are fundamentally opposed to actual, radical change (and so they tend to be more likely to radicalize towards reformist [social democracy](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Social_democracy)).

{"author":"GreenGones","body":"The ZAD originally is a 70's administrative acronym that stands for Zone d'Am\u00e9nagement Diff\u00e9r\u00e9 (Area of delayed development) that was supposed to be the location of a new airport on the oceanic coast of France (in Notre-Dame des Landes, or NDDL), that would have huge consequences : destruction of the wild life and expulsion of the local farmers. It became an area of social experiment and resistance, or Zone A D\u00e9fendre (Area To Defend). The people there started experimenting some sort of alternative society, and got a lot of attention from anarchists from France and Europe, and some migrated temporarily when police tried to crush them (and....failed &lt;3). Check out Op\u00e9ration C\u00e9sar (name of the failed police operation) if you want to know more.\n\nIn the more recent years, the debate surrounding the area heated as many legal battles were coming to an end. A rigged referendum (I can explain why it was rigged) allowed the airport by a small margin, but the resistance on the spot stayed strong. Last year Macron was elected president and his government announced a couple of months ago that they were dropping the airport project. But now, in a midst of big social changes and activism, they decided to expel the area with BIG means (the gendarmerie a civil branch of the military, assault tanks and assault riffles). The expulsion is still going on is very violent.","created_utc":1524072707,"score":20,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"azucarleta","body":"Honestly I think it's no more radical than preferring an honest-to-goodness \"reformatory\" to a \"penitentiary.\" Notice that he stuck in the weasel word \"truly\" in the phrase \"truly to blame.\" Let me explain. \n\nI don't think determinism is the only way to escape responsibility\/free will.  Absolute determinism defeats the ideas of responsibility and free will absolutely.  But I think this is something far short of the claim of ultimate determinism. He really only problematizes and complicates responsibility -- not destroying it completely the way determinism might. \n\nAside: His idea is not determinism.  It's more like chaos theory (Which, I'm no physician, so maybe those two things are more easily wedded than I imagine, but to me they seem like opposites). As he says, how you will react to stimulus is determined by your brain synapses, genetics and conditioning -- and even your brain synapses were wired by interaction between genetics and conditioning, without your consent or input. None of us had any say into which genetics or environment we would grow in -- it was all random, and ongoing stimulus was likewise random -- we all agree with that. We did not consent to this! lol.  \n\nSo the conclusion -- that responsibility AS WE USUALLY THINK OF IT is a myth -- is a tiny little logical leap from those premises.  And I think we still have a will, but it's not as free as liberals like to argue that it is. \n\nI think tho that we can still shake out some room for something like personal responsibility here, but I don't think that it could ever be quite so judgmental and punitive as the traditional regime of responsibility has been.  I think all he's trying to get at is applications, like that any facility where we house dangerous people really truly ought to be comfortable and provide opportunities for realzy correction and restoration--like really great therapy and educational opportunities ought to exist for folks who are on a time out (because we're not gonna put people in cages after the rev). Liek humans are not inherently responsible for their crimes.  But humans who can live peaceably and socially with one another must accept and assume responsibility for the peaceable interaction within the social system of their selection.  But let's not assume that everyone is immediately responsible for their sociality or lack thereof. We must consent to any responsibility we hold. \n\nTell me if I'm wrong.

What happens when different cultural groups simply can\u2019t reach a consensus on something, such as the rights of women to self-determination? Should the polity respect those who disagree because of multicultural acceptance, or should the polity act to dismantle that culture\u2019s beliefs towards women? How should it proceed when both positions seem to impose some oppressive values on another group? That\u2019s a very basic criticism. How can Rojava\u2019s adherence to Jineology interact with other anti-imperialist traditions in the region? Something to consider.\n\nIn practice, Rojava has been criticized\u2014unfairly, in my opinion\u2014for receiving help from state entities during the fight against ISIS.

{"author":"meangreen2018","body":"&gt;Many of you are wondering what is happening here, wanting to listen at the doors of our cabins, our trucks, our rooms, our houses, our tents and makeshift shelters .\nAs spring brings the renewal, in our lives it\u2019s still winter.\nBoth the cold breath of internal battles within our beautiful Zad and the winds of the battles to come against the world closing up on us are blowing strong.\nI had a dream of unconditional solidarity between all those who fought against the construction of this airport. Just like two friends ready to take a blow for each other, even when in disagreement with each other.\nThe end result is well below my expectations.\n\n&gt;We find ourselves divided even within the occupation movement. Various setbacks have happened. Pressure blows, overriding of rules, confiscation of collective communication tools (inter-committee contacts, press contacts); attempts of uniforming the movement; centralization of relations with the other components of the movement, decisions bypassing collective processes; violent and authoritarian political policing.\nIt now seems necessary to take back what we fought for. To reaffirm our identity against the fascist actions of those who used to be our companions or comrades in struggle.\n\n&gt;Almost all of us arrived here with a marginal status that makes us ungovernable, mysterious, disorganized, unknowable and wary of power and its centralization. We applauded each initiative from the most violent to the most inefficient without dissociating ourselves, without individualizing the actions.\n\n&gt;Most of us were Camille, we were all Zadists.\n\n&gt;We mainly legitimized and explained the political acts of ours equals rather than condemning them. We accepted the chaos and lack of control we had over our neighbours.\nToday for me this is no longer true.\n\n&gt;Some people have emerged over the years as amazing strategists, bureaucrats, politicians and journalists. Many of us are now the good little soldiers for the political strategies of these groups. We must stay in the rank and file so as not to disturb their tactics and their communications. We must obey and not speak too loudly, or expose ourselves to the threat of being despised or of ending up in a car\u2019s trunk.\nI am not against the idea of building a united, shared and resilient political future with other components of the movement. It\u2019s even my greatest hope. But it will not happen at the cost of what I am.\n\n&gt;Many of us want the Zad to remain a front line against liberal and patriarchal thoughts, while persisting to be a zone of political, social and peasantry experimentation.\n\n&gt;For we have arrived damaged, marginal, impulsive, borderline, pirate, teknohead, druggy, syndicalist, in psychological distress, hypersensitive, engaged, primitivists, drug addicts, alcoholic, hippy, punk \u2026 or just fragile.\nSome of us are still so, and we will not dress up in a certain way in order to give an \u201cacceptable\u201d image.\nMany of us are ready to wage an internal and silent war against those who impose their collective vision or tactics over individual freedom of action and opinion against those who make use of psychological or physical violence for politicians.\n\n&gt;In my opinion, the formal groups of the Zad (chips, cmdo, pomps) should officially dissolve, no longer publish texts and no longer come to the assemblies on the Zad as a composant of the movement but as individuals.\nToday we see the result of this group-based sectarianism in the minds of each and every one of us, and in this way we are moving away from the humanist values of sharing and solidarity. It drowns the individual and makes them question everyday: Am I legitimate to give my opinion in front of this group of people strongly united to block? Do I have enough affinity to go to such an appointment or assembly? Is this project open if it\u2019s this group that is carrying away with it? Will I be despised by this group of people when I have a contradictory position? Will I be supported by my own group?\n\n&gt;The peculiarity of the group is the unified language, the group airs its concerns. Ironically the group often agrees to despise the same thing or the same person, while on the other hand the group can itself be despised without taking into account the individuals that compose it.\n\n&gt;I don\u2019t deny the usefulness of federating to carry out a job, a battle, an action. But the group should appear and disappear according to circumstances. It is ephemeral, it must not be named or coagulate, if it is formed, it is already too late. It must change to avoid collapse. If a group is created in the group then it is dead.\nAnd especially if the group silence its individualities then it no longer exists.\n\n&gt;The Zad is not a group, it is a territory. The Zad is only a group when it has to organize its daily life, defend itself, communicate, gather or talk about itself. And in these moments it can not bear yet another group acting on its behalf, even from within.\n\n&gt;The Zad is a palette of individuality with all colours as rich as each other with a common front.\nIt is useless to deny the differences which compose it nor to hide them under the sacrosanct concept of unity.\n\n&gt;I affirm my desire, as others do, to deconstruct power wherever it is and wherever it is born . Whether it\u2019s a person or a group of people.\nIt is a daily effort on power that one incarnates or that the other person embodies. As tiring as this work is, it is the foundation of our individual liberties.\n\n&gt;I advocate a diversity of tactics, choices and political views, ways of life, past or future experiences, as long as they do not impose themselves on us individually and they do not harm our daily life. (It appears necessary to clarify this: If an isolated political action provokes a repressive state answer on each and every one of us, our values advice us against dissociating ourselves from it. Even if it is it contradicts with our tactics and general opinion. It seems easier to applaud a burnt police car burnt 300 km than to support a smaller action near home.)\n\n&gt;That is to say, I would fight to defend those who will become in necessity of defense, without distinctions, so that we can continue to make exchanges relative to conflicting issues and to the convergences that drive us forward.","created_utc":1524090507,"score":5,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Depending on who you kill or rape, you will have a different level of restitution. If you kill a family's high-earning breadwinner, you will have a very high fee to work off. If you are unable or unwilling to work off your debt, you (the criminal) become the property of the victim or victim's family. They may choose (this is going to sound barbaric, but we're just brainstorming, right?) to harvest your organs and get what they can from you.

I'd classify myself as libertarian socialist with a desire to go as fully anarchist as humanly possible. \n\n I'd seen the idea of \"just banish them\" in response to offenses more than once in anarchist circles as an alternative to prison, so this is my attempt to follow that out to its logical conclusion (particularly what happens when the majority of locally organized communities decide they want nothing to do with you).\n\nNon exile solutions would come first and I brought a few up, I didn't discuss them at length in this post because it's easy for non-anarchists to grasp more peaceful and authoritarian ways of resolving many disputes, their objection always lies with the real real bad ones where a person is an active danger to those around them. \n\nNo, I don't think someone should receive harsher punishments for murder in a society where the intent is to treat every life as an equal. I don't think *punishment* is even the right way to think about - the goal is to actively better the community and to defend the community, it's not about revenge or justice, but whatever solution best resolves the problem while preserving individual liberty.\n\n&gt;There won't be a fixed fee established by the state\n\nthere also wouldn't be a state\n\n&gt;become the property\n\nWho's enforcing your claim to own another person? It's not going to be other anarchists that's for damned sure. \n\n&gt;sell you to the highest bidder \n\nCongratulations you just advocated to re-open the slave trade.

But just because an individual has the ability and the right to have a kid, that doesn't confer upon them the authority to be a parent. I'm not advocating for some state-run child rearing facility or anything, but at present some people are allowed to do a lot of harm to their children wielding the authority that comes from legal guardianship. This harm could be physical, as we see with people who refuse to vaccinate their children, or it could be mental, as we see with parents who take their queer or questioning kids to conversion \"therapists.\"\n\nI think that the idea of \"parental authority\" needs to be destroyed or at least fundamentally changed. I don't have an exact answer, but the solution, to me, includes listening to and trusting kids more, being less afraid as members of communities to intervene when we see people doing harm to their kids, and publicly and loudly condemning anyone who profits from facilitating the abuse of kids, like conversion \"therapists\" or any doctor who condones not vaccinating kids or boot camps and fat camps.","created_utc":1524158125,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Montessori doesn't work for social children, and Waldorf is a communistic cult. The Democratic approach seems like it wouldn't work for economically challenged children.\n\nAlotta these systems wouldn't work for *economically challenged children.* As shitty as the modern education system is, it's sadly kinda appropriate for preparing the average, not rich, person for the modern world. They get used to being bossed around, given a system and acquire the basic skills they need to get into Uni or what have you. But again, there are actual school systems that try to turn your kids into Ibn al-Haytham or Leonardo Da Vinci but they sure as heck aren't most schools nor would it entirely make sense for most schools to try and do that.\n\nI'd personally only advise something like Democratic if you already live in a society that's similar to it... Where people don't have to work to survive, where things are democratically run, where their basic needs are handled, where whatever work they'll be doing when they grow up will **truly** be of their choosing and of a rather intellectual nature. That being said, I've heard Dem students tend to keep up quite fine with normal students in other schools when they do end up taking final exams and stuff to go to college... \n\nBut yeah, if it were me, and I had the free-time, I'd probably just home-school my kids in a manner similar to how user *Fark0* described their childhood [here.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/comments\/67v04e\/how_did_you_become_an_anarchist\/) Give them plenty of free-time and encourage learning whatever they want whilst emphasizing the mandatory learning of certain things like basic arithmetic and, of course, reading alongside a basic grasp of the sciences. I do think the relationship between parent and child is something of a *justifiable hierarchy* given the child's far less developed brain and, well, the fact that you chose to bring them into this world, so you have to take charge to a certain extent but not be imperious and break their spirit.","created_utc":1524219366,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

If you genuinely care about democracy and survival of this planet you should be critical and question this.\n\nYou hold an immense power within yourself alone being at such an event, this is only multiplied by the many others also at the same event frustrated about the current situation or issue at hand and physically going out to do something about it to make change.\n\nYou have to be extremely careful too. I've come into contact with some people who are purely drawn for a kick and a love for violence, these are dangerous people who can get you into trouble. If you do go to a protest or event you should go with people who you trust and can rely on or build upon establishing more people who you can.\n\nIn Germany this is the case where I've never seen the same level of organising:- Many people from their community and estates come out together on protests who know each other personally. Just by building your own connections with people who share some similar beliefs or are part of marginalised, minority groups is something you can easily do which is valuably worth working and building toward. 'Without people, you're are nothing.' - Joe Strummer\n\nI've come to a sober realisation too as I've grown more what such conflict entails which history shows to be fatal. The State is unforgiving and merciless in their pursue to establish power and those who challenge it. People have been jailed, beaten and murdered who have stood up to challenge this very order such as the likes of Fred Hampton as a prime example. \n\nAnswering your question, I don't think anyone asked to suffer or to starve  in this world for not having money. I don't think ordinary families and civilians wanted to rebel or fight and stand in the way of Authority and Police who hold weapons and trunctions which could kill them. \n\nWe have lives to live, happiness to seek and so much positive and wonderful things to be grateful for in this world right now.

{"author":"fiskiligr","body":"Lifestyle anarchism is sorta unrelated. Lifestyle anarchism is more like being all talk but no action. You listen to radical music, wear clothes with radical messages, but you still get coffee from Starbucks every morning and go to the movies to watch *Avengers* films on the weekend, etc. Where your values are completely out of sync with your actions.\n\nI think \/u\/ocherthulu is talking more about living in a way that helps create equality every day. You build independence by growing your own food. Instead of buying furniture you make it. Stop consuming, stop giving money and power to the powerful. Maybe you choose to only buy things from co-ops, or maybe you join and advocate for an industrial union at work. Maybe you join a collective of people who have shared values - volunteering at a local community farm that is focused on food justice, or helping with a Food Not Bombs chapter. These *build* the revolution rather than focusing on tearing down society (which will only alienate the exact people who would otherwise make anarchism possible). \n\nRevolution will be necessary, just like it was in 1776. [As Lincoln said](http:\/\/hd.housedivided.dickinson.edu\/node\/40532):\n\n&gt;  Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right to rise up, and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them better. This is a most valuable,---a most sacred right---a right, which we hope and believe, is to liberate the world. \n\nBut it will not happen until a majority of people have embraced human equality and the values of anarchism. The police and military traditionally have been important tools in making these revolutions possible, and we should be thinking about how to reclaim this potential. Even in the West Virginia Mine Wars, cops turned against their government to defend the striking workers against the mining company's armed guards. It is a major failure of anarchism to see cops as sub-human traitors instead of seeing the potential for these people to make an anarchist reality possible. Even so, the violence of revolution must be purposeful, necessary, and cold. One should never desire rioting. One should never desire violence.

An able bodied person can do many more forms of labour than a person without use of their legs. This is inherent to capital. Hierarchy production is also inherent to science, and our scientistic system accelerates that like capitalism accelerates wealth gaps. \n\nIf you cannot extend a criticism of capitalism to its source, then you are a blind liberal.","created_utc":1524246923,"score":-2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"trigwarn","body":"Reputation is the aggregate of one-to-many social relationship. There is no single ideology, but sum of whatever each individual thinks.\n\nI use this simplification of relationships into reputation because the outcome is that if many don't like an individual (and each can have their own personal reason for that), that individuals reputation will be low, and we don't need to care exactly why.\n\nIn a society with bottom up governance, that directly translates to people being treated according to how the majority feels about them, as there is no other system in place to force em to act in discord with that disposition of majority. Sure that reputation market is, ultimately, still a collectivized power system, what I'm trying to do is figure out least coercive one (this one is, more or less, democratic up to certain distance in social graph).\n\nAs I outlined in OP, basic human empathy is generally enough for effective affirmative action for the less abled, especially if there is no material cost incentivizing sociopathy - when the system of exchange is based solely on reputation, people are in fact incentivized to \"show their good side\" as that is one way to \"earn reputation\", a bit like how christianity does it.\n\nConversely, if you put in a top-down dictat about how somebody should be treated, you need an uniform system to enforce that dictat. Simply put, i pose that empathy, both genuine or peer pressured is fine, but designing top-down systems with comissars to help less abled implies a structure of patronizing control.\n\n&gt;Or workers in areas which for reasons of capital availability\n\nCapital is reputation based, so there's no shortage. Poor stay poor and rich get richer may still apply though, generally as a matter of human bias towards idolatry. It could be argued that \"from zero to hero\" is far easier in terms of reputation as opposed to hard money capital, but this is flimsy ice.\n\nIgnoring biases, the disparity problem seems to exist only purely as a matter of productivity. The issue with less abled having lower productivity works out if they are dispersed in generally productive population, but indeed the problem I'm running into is when they clump up together as clique and they don't have enough direct reputation links for the aggregate safety net to form. Worse, that sort of initial isolation could foster further us-vs-them tribalism, which just worsens their isolation and lack of social (now pegged to investment) capital.\n\n&gt;natural resources\n\nIn ideal markets, cost of natural resource is only that of extracting it, and anyone must be allowed to do so. If you privatize natural monopoly commons, all market models for that fail utterly. Same goes for capital ownership in form of cummulative advantage+winner takes all of zero sum money supply.\n\nHowever your point stands on matter of cost of transporation - it's cheaper to manufacture product at place of resource extraction, and then transporting the finished product. As opposed to, exporting the raw resource, provided all the local labor can cover all extraction capacity of the raw resource. To how much degree this effect is a problem is still something I'm trying to quantify.\n\nThe trick with elastic-supply reputation (as opposed to zero-sum accumulated capital) markets is that ruthless behavior of stereotypical capitalist will be popularly disliked, so whatever they earn through exploitation, is to be sapped away by their low reputation on the other end. Better be (or at least convincingly pretend to be) the good guy, or pay high taxes. \n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nudge_theory\n\n&gt;Talking about these imbalances in terms of \"debt\" and \"freeloading\" risks moralizing these issues\n\nThose are indeed loaded terms for some. To clarify, freeloader deterrence as characterized in OP actually *depends* on the surroundings passing that judgement - by refusing to accept IOUs from somebody they suspect to never pay the collective back (not even according to their ability). The judgement, on average, will then simply reflect aggregate politics (as well as spare resources) of that social clique, as well factoring in social circumstances - tolerate a couch rider longer in apartment if they're fun to be around.\n\nIt should be noted that reputation must never be tracked explicitly via some upvotes or somesuch (that's a quick road to hell for obvious reasons). Reputation is merely reflected in how much credit we extend to each other, and anyone is free to tailor the credit line according to the circumstances of their individual relationship. On aggregate, reputable people (for whatever reason) will secure more credit that on average less reputable people (for whatever reason), hence the equivalence reputation = credit.\n","created_utc":1524273028,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

The American government rejecting segregation didn't end racism, even when it sent the national guard in to protect civil rights marchers from the klan. Nor did the destruction of Czarist Russia and Nazi Germany cause the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories they fostered to vanish. \n\nWhat would a reputation-based market system mean to a trans person, or other minority who's not terribly popular with large parts of the majority? A substantially reduced income and drastically curtailed economic opportunities? How would you prevent that?\n\n&gt;Capital is reputation based, so there's no shortage.\n\nEven if you replaced all money and economic transactions with a reputation-based market tomorrow, we'd still be starting from a massively unequal distribution of physical and intellectual capital. Simply put, a single person in an industrialized nation using advanced technologies can often produce more than entire village in the third world. That means people from wealthy areas are going to have a lot more to give, and will in turn mean they accrue a good reputation far faster than the poor. How do you avoid triggering a concentration of wealth this way?\n\n&gt;In ideal markets, cost of natural resource is only that of extracting it, and anyone must be allowed to do so. \n\nIn that ideal market, the ecosystem is doomed.

Having river systems appropriate for hydro power, rich mineral deposits or a favorable climate for agriculture are going to grant some people in this system a massive advantage.\n\n&gt;However your point stands on matter of cost of transporation - it's cheaper to manufacture product at place of resource extraction, and then transporting the finished product. As opposed to, exporting the raw resource.\n\nIf this were true all of Africa would look like Wakanda. In real life, manufacturing rarely happens near resource extraction, to the point where they embody two different kinds of economy - primary (third world) and tertiary (first world). There's a whole pile of complicated reasons this happens, but generally resource extraction tends to take place in areas without a lot of people whereas manufacturing takes place where there are (also near other manufacturing, education, and with closer proximity to end-users). \n\nIn general, I like your approach and wholeheartedly agree that anarchists need actual answers on economic questions, not just vague handwaves.

People who are distant socially have very little power over me with their actions, opinions or ideology. This is natural outcome of bottom-up governance.\n\nThe way one ends up in situation you describe is abrubt revelation of some identity (\"Mom, I'm transitioning\"), and majority may not be comfortable with it for one reason or another (\"Mormon family\").\n\nI think if we had solutions to the ensuing rift in relationships, we'd have a silver bullet to help *a lot* of people who get estranged from their friends and family *now*. I'm afraid the outcome will be same as with intolerant friends and family - you either convince em to change their ideology, or get estranged and migrate to more accepting clique: an exile is usually the cost of stark non-conformance in any group.\n\nThe thing we're only trying to deal with is systematic oppression: stranger-on-stranger conflict on basis of contrasting identity and\/or ideology.\n\n&gt;Even if you replaced all money and economic transactions with a reputation-based market tomorrow, we'd still be starting from a massively unequal distribution of physical and intellectual capital.\n\n\"reboots\" of humanity with *radically* different social systems in place are not all that uncommon. As far I know, it's the *only* known way of massive equalization of wealth in recorded human history, too.\n\nHistorically, collapses of empires involve bloodshed in the process of dismantling status quo. An interesting line of inquiry is whether this is inevitable, or it was because past revolutions were generally variation of same patriarchal tune, and less violence would happen if violent masculinity was systematically discouraged from the get go as the new system filling the opening in the power vacuum. There are some rare examples of this - Rojava, for instance, managed to avoid most of ingroup violence endemic to the region with carefuly tuned semi-anarchic ethos in certain aspects.\n\n&gt; I'm not necessarily against markets, but I feel like this proposal needs more socialism, if only to guard against the formation of new clusters of wealth and power.\n\nThere are many failure modes to easily tear this apart. Because the approach only attempts at arriving to economically sound, but utterly idealistic model, where only basic human driving forces are accounted for.\n\nThe idea is that once one has that model in place, it could be relatively easy to \"plug\" holes in it caused by concrete physical realities of the world, ie making the model non-idealized but still striving to some paragon ideal of a sound system, as opposed to completely unsound utopias.\n\nAs for socialism, I'm handwaving it at the moment and putting it into framework of mutualism of classical anarchists - anything deemed a natural monopoly, be it means of production, land or raw resources has a public commons covenant. Markets serve only exchange of labor and personal property, but embody no monopolies (I consider mutualist market as \"ideal\" as no monopolies can arise in there).\n\n&gt; If this were true all of Africa would look like Wakanda\n\nIf we are to cherrypick, try lithium - the sources are far and between, and raw ore is generally too costly to ship off-continent.

It gets quite a bit more morally ambiguous in war, of course, since you're dealing with not only enemy combatant's, but innocent civilians as well, and justifying civilian deaths becomes an onerous proposition.\n\nIn general, I think for any moral action, one has only to look at the predictable consequences of that action in order to decide whether it's right or wrong, In war, this is obviously difficult, but in personal situations it becomes quite a bit simpler. If someone attacks you personally, or is attacking someone else, I think it's not to justify defending you or others with violence. However, in peacetime it becomes very difficult to justify attacking someone without provocation, in my view, no matter what sort of uniform they have on. And the reason is that the consequences are usually an increase in reciprocal violence, a deepening of hatred for the attacker and deeper commitment to his principles, a negative public reaction, or I suppose a reduction of violence out of an instillation of fear or respect.

The CNT as the oldest organisation should really take some responsibility for just throwing their toys out of the pram instead of trying to fix the IWA from within. Because of the respect due to them it was rare to have any of their motions fail and they basically ran the IWA for a while.

You can battle illness all you want, you can try your fucking hardest to find other planets to colonize and make a home (because the earth, one of these days, is gonna be *fucked*) but time will always keep on keeping on, and we will grow old whether we want to or not.\n\nDeath is coming for you my friend. Recognize it. *Embrace* it! Whether you want death or not is not the question you should be asking yourself. The question should be asking yourself how you are going to take this truth. By running away from it via attempts at immortality and longevity? If this is the case, when death finally takes you into its arms, you will only feel fear, loathing, and failure. Is that any way to go into death?\n\nYou're too good for that. You're better than that.","created_utc":1524332019,"score":7,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"trigwarn","body":"&gt;A tremendous amount of systemic oppression happens this way now. You don't need any prior relationship to preferentially hire white people over black folk. \n\nHonestly, I have no good answer how to tackle race\/identity\/other based tribalism. My pet theory is that the more we're estranged and alienated from each other, the more breeding ground for tribalism. One could hope that less reliance on state and capital, and more reliance on making connections would reignite a \"melting pot\" of culture, instead of more segregation.\n\n&gt; As long as reputation can be used to gain resources and vice versa, peole will be able to game that system.\n\nThe incentive *is* to \"game\" the system. If I give away \"free\" gifts (accept \"worthless\" IOUs), I gain reputation. I repeat again, **reputation is not an absolute value**, there are no upvotes. It's a collective opinion, but an imaginary metric - what really does exist is point-to-point quantified relationship (credit balances), and absolute reputation value is derived if you evaluate social graph - you get slightly different result from differing graph node perspective in a clique, the further away from the clique the less trustworthy result one gets.\n\nThe rationale for this borrows heavily from gift economies, with attempt to scale it up to global social graph by aggregating social standing in a clique.\n\nComplete strangers are simply two people with no reputation standing between each other and can't interact whatsoever in this system - they first need to be introduced on friend of a friend basis, which is how we transcend the tribal isolationism.\n\nAs complete strangers can't really interact on their own, there are certain complexities to how such a system is built - what you end up with is that each clique has a \"rating agency\", or \"emissary\" as a member. Those specialize in bridging cliques and relay reputation opinion about a stranger from distant cliques - and in turn, vouch for that stranger.\n\nAnother \"relay\" on the other end of the stranger, does the same. Their job would pretty much amount to stalking other cliques they barely know and trying to guess how trustworthy they could be, on behalf of their clique of friends and\/or clients.\n\nIf a stranger turns out to be douche anyway, the \"credit rating agency\" loses their reputation in the clique. This mechanism is again, in common use in modern capital markets. Because the reputation metric is expressed as aggregate credit line available, more tricky financial instruments can be deployed - reputation insurance, futures, options etc.\n\nAll of the above can be heavily automated in the context of futuristic social networking software. My dabbling into decentralism\/anarchy is trying to figure out how exactly could such a thing would work in terms of socio-economics.\n","created_utc":1524332223,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Why? Because it\u2019s a controversial method that many in this sub are obsessed with. And it could be quite dangerous to encourage it.\n\nFor instance, what if some member of antifa felt compelled , after reading this thread, to head over to Motel 6 last night and punch one of the nazis meeting there. Suppose he died because he hit his head as he fell or something. Such an instance could spark public and state anger towards, and result in a crackdown on this sub and any other group associated with \u201canarchism.\u201d It would only be bad news as a consequences.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not as far-fetched as you might believe. A neo-Nazi (who was more or less rogue, although there were others online advocating for using cars to run over people) murdered Heather Heyer and this resulted in irreparable damage to the alt-right.  Furthermore, historically anarchists have been persecuted after rogue members threw bombs at public officials. You do *not* want anything remotely similar to any anarchist movement today.\n\nThat\u2019s why I think it\u2019s extremely irresponsible to encourage random violence against others.

{"author":"cand86","body":"No, Planned Parenthood was not created by the federal government.  Planned Parenthood began in 1916 as the \"American Birth Control League\" and was a clinic distributing birth control, birth control advice, and birth control information at a time when doing so was illegal (said information and devices were considered \"obscene\").  They later on became Planned Parenthood and, upon the legalization of abortion, provided abortions as well.  Federal funding for Planned Parenthood started in 1970, when Nixon signed into law the Family Planning Services and Population Research Act, whose Title X provides funding for family planning services.\n\nAnd no, Planned Parenthood was not used as population control on people of color.  (In fact, one of my favorite little tidbits of knowledge is how Teddy Roosevelt opposed birth control for racist reasons, writing: \" . . . the man or woman who deliberately avoids marriage and has a heart so cold as to know no passion and a brain so shallow and selfish as to dislike having children, is in effect a criminal against the race and should be an object of contemptuous abhorrence by all healthy people.\"  In response to Roosevelt's claims of birth control being suicide of the white race, Planned Parenthood's founder Margaret Sanger responded: \"There is all this talk about race suicide . . . I say the race ought to commit suicide unless it can take care of its children better.\").\n\nBlack leaders have long worked with Margaret Sanger and Planned Parenthood, including W. E. B. Du Bois and Martin Luther King, Jr., who was given an award that his wife accepted on his behalf, reading out a speech he had written.  There will probably always be some accusations of bias, as the rates of unintended pregnancy are higher in communities of color (in and of itself a function of racial disparities in poverty and education), so that a higher number of abortions, or clinics located in those communities, may lead some to believe they are being \"targeted\" even though it's merely meeting the demand.  Planned Parenthood doesn't force anybody to have abortions or get birth control- the women who choose to go there are making a decision for themselves.\n\nThe federal government has most certainly been behind some awful, racist and eugenic reproductive rights violations ([for example](http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/opinion\/editorials\/la-ed-eugenics-california-20170122-story.html))- but Planned Parenthood is not part of the federal government, and it about the worst thing folks can level at it are twisted conclusions based on it being founded in a time period where eugenics was all the rage, and by meeting the need of its communities of color currently.","created_utc":1524346964,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Zaratustash","body":"Well in general what people on the far\\-left mean by idealism is usually taken from philosophy: idealism is the thesis that ideas change matter, it can be a form of dualism in extreme cases, like what you would see in Ancient Greek and eventually Christian ontology, well into Descartes but also it can even be a form of idealist monism, like people such as Fichte or some German Idealists of the 19th century, in which the only thing you can be sure exists is thought and self\\-consciousness.\n\nWhen MLs\/MLM left uses it, it is used to critique people who think change occurs solely via thought and ideas: people who think for example that a correct ideology \/ morality \/ whatever, and people spreading it is what will change the material base of society \\(which is hypocritical because they think exactly that when it comes to their specific twisting and deformation of marxist analysis, may it be ML or MLM\\), which is incorrect because ideology\/ideas\/modes of politico\\-cultural thought is part of the \"super\\-structure\" of a given society, which stems from the concrete material base of society \\(the mode of production\\). What's funny is that they forget the second part of the theory, developed by \\(smarter\\) MLs and orthodox marxists like Gramsci, Althusser, or in the case of anarchists, Debord: the superstructure is not just a category entirely dependent on the base, with no impact on it: it also serves to reproduce \\(or disrupt\\) the base itself, so in that sense, ideas can most certainly have a material impact, they are just limited to the given socio\\-historical situation of the material base, and balance of forces at a given moment as to the control of the superstructure.\n\nSorry if it is verbose, feel free to ask for clarifications.

{"author":"NeedYourTV","body":"Leninists use the word in a couple of ways. The more orthodox, formal way is that an idealist philosophy is one that points ideals before material conditions. \n\nFor example, a group of slaves thinking that if they can convince their master that they are human that he will let them go. The basis of this action being that once the master recognizes them as people, his empathy will lead him to releasing them. This is idealist because even if they were able to convince him of that, there exist many physical reasons for him to deny them their freedom that trump his empathy (financial concerns, legal concerns, etc). While it is possible that he let's them go regardless, it is so unlikely as to be suicidal.\n\nLeninists apply this idea to anarchists because they view anarchist praxis to consist of equally powerless appeals to morality. They believe that the revolution necessitates a rigid heirarchy and concrete structures in order to take power and retain it long enough to oust the global bourgeoisie. They see anarchist support of fluid relations and impermanent heirarchy, if it is tolerated at all, as impotent and ultimately counter-revolutionary as it leads to conflict against their own, supposedly necessary, formulations. The support is not seen as being done for physical, material reasons but out of a devotion to anarchist ethics, for the ideals of Anarchism, and is thus *idealist*.\n\nThe other, informal use of the word that I've seen is just as a pejorative to say you're ideas are non-materialist, ie religious, and have no basis in reality.\n\nedit: non-instant communication was a mistake","created_utc":1524357105,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

How would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up?

{"author":"DenverHoxha","body":"&gt;Honestly, I have no good answer how to tackle race\/identity\/other based tribalism.\n\nThis stuff isn't just a matter of tribalism tho, especially in the context of an economic system. At the risk of sounding Marxist, they're heavily entrenched in the social relations that surround production (including social reproduction, ie: having and raising kids). It isn't just a matter of groups self-segregating - it's about certain groups that have managed to find positions which grant them an economic advantage, which in turn can be translated into the political power to keep it going. \n\n\n&gt;The incentive is to \"game\" the system. If I give away \"free\" gifts (accept \"worthless\" IOUs), I gain reputation. I repeat again, reputation is not an absolute value, there are no upvotes. It's a collective opinion, but an imaginary metric - what really does exist is point-to-point quantified relationship (credit balances), and absolute reputation value is derived if you evaluate social graph - you get slightly different result from differing graph node perspective in a clique, the further away from the clique the less trustworthy result one gets.\n\nIt doesn't really matter if these metrics are absolute or relative. One's class position under capitalism is notoriously difficult to objectively measure, but there's little doubt that it has a massive effect on your life and economic\/political prospects. If, under the system you propose, \"reputation\" matters enough to make economic decisions, then it matters enough to present a risk of creating new centres of power. \n\n&gt;As complete strangers can't really interact on their own, there are certain complexities to how such a system is built - what you end up with is that each clique has a \"rating agency\", or \"emissary\" as a member. Those specialize in bridging cliques and relay reputation opinion about a stranger from distant cliques - and in turn, vouch for that stranger.\n\nThis, I suspect, is where trouble would arise. What it creates is, in effect, a class of economic specialists who act as gatekeepers for crucial economic bottlenecks, much the same way bankers do today (or the Soviet bureaucracy in the USSR). This power will only grow as they accrue more resources and the system gets more sophisticated, especially if they aren't constrained by the kind of regulations markets see today. Would you vote against someone at your local neighbourhood council who has the power to veto all your economic contact with the world outside your community, even on an insignificant or unrelated issue? \n\nDecentralized systems can recentralize themselves pretty quickly if you're not careful. The real challenge with any revolution is not only to resist the power structures of today, but also those which might arise tomorrow. When they overthrew feudalism, nobody thought merchants had the potential to become an even more powerful ruling class. When Bakunin and the anarchists tried to warn Marx about the dangers of a \"Red Bureaucracy\" they got laughed right out of the First International.

There are irreconcilable economic interests between, say, the slavemaster and his slaves, or between the capitalist and the workers. For one to win, the other must lose.\n\nMarxism considers itself a materialist theory, that understands history as being the record of conflicts between social classes. It disdains idealism. \"Idealist\" is basically a slur that Stalinists throw around at everyone they dislike. They have a tenuous grasp on what they're talking about.

You don't want total obsession with life either, because when you do finally die, you'll be certain to suffer. You want to give life value, and do the deeds that come easily and naturally to prolong it, but realize that at a certain point the value and dignity in death outweighs the life that's being lived.

(Undiagnosed autism, I'm expected to pick up proper behavior by observing through a sense that I don't have.  It results in being unintentionally insulting when I get it wrong.  I don't have the energy to be that hypervigilant all of the time.)  However, treating them any differently is bad.

I am against funding schools locally because it's a cycle of under-educated parents not being able to support their children's education properly.\n\nThe fear part comes from other things that are further down.

{"author":"eliaspowers","body":"&gt;I'm not participating in or contributing to white supremacy by making an off-color joke within my group of friends. \n\nAs \/u\/Kelekona notes, jokes smuggle in claims about the world as well as moral claims, as they require you to accept certain premises as true in order to get the joke. The result is that such jokes allow people to tacitly assert and spread racist ideas, all without having to explicitly endorse the view. So, when you tell your friends an \"off-color\" joke, you are often going to be asking them to hold in their minds, at least temporarily, the thought that the racist premise in question is true. The worry is that this mimesis takes route and actually shifts the way they think about the targeted group. Roughly, you are temporarily pretending to hold a racist idea in your mind, but if you pretend you think something for long enough, sometimes you actually start to think it.\n\n&gt;The left is never going to be a force to be reckoned with if we try to wage a war on humor.\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that there are other forms of humor besides racist humor! Opposing racism and being funny are actually compatible! Wow!\n\nMore generally, I would note that whether or not the left succeeds is almost certainly not going to turn on criticism of racist jokes.\n\nIn general, this post reads like a psychological defense mechanism. You saw something on a racism chart that you do, but you don't want to accept that you participate in a racist practice. Thus, the chart must be wrong!\n\nPerhaps, the better thing to do then reflexively reject ideas that call your self-conception into question is to do a bit of critical self-reflection where you actually entertain the idea that you might be participating in a harmful practice. After all, I'm sure you admit that we live in a racist, generally fucked up society where people have all sorts of pernicious attitudes. But, given that you were raised in this society, why think that you are entirely immune from such attitudes? ","created_utc":1524459031,"score":16,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Imposing a particular economic system or philosophy on people doesn't really make sense in that context; I think it ends up ignoring those things, as well as material conditions.\n\nI think greater tolerance, dialogue, and cooperation between different anarchists is more productive than being at each others throats or being suspicious of each other too. I see this all the time. The idea that mutualists are secretly capitalists or that ancoms are a step away from becoming MLs, when there's no evidence of either, frustrates the hell out of me. What does any of that *do* for people?\n\nDogmatism and paranoia not only keep the classical schools divided, but it pushes away the new. I think one of the reasons why some people of color have misgivings about anarchism is because it seems insulated in 19th and 20th century Europe. And with the rise of genuinely opportunistic shit (anarcho-capitalism, national-anarchism, etc), this has gotten worse. Decolonial, indigenous, and black anarchism are ignored or lambasted by traditional class-struggle-anarchists for being \"nationalist\", even if authors from these groups point out that they aren't nationalists or that nationalism isn't sufficient. Again, what does any of that *do* but turn anarchism into a stale, useless thing?\n\nA more clear focus on anarchy, rather than the adjectives, would also go a long way in accurately dispelling authoritarian opportunism. If anarchism is against authority, it's not very difficult to see why anarcho-capitalism or national-anarchism aren't anarchists --- they leave room for authority. If we're going to have a litmus test for who is and isn't anarchist, that's all we need.\n\nBut more than all that, I think anarchism must be [synthetic](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/voline-on-synthesis). All these schools and all these ways of viewing the world not only attack authority at different angles, but also say very important and very real things. People are individualist. People are communal. People are atheist. People are spiritual. People like trade. People like gifting. People like technology. People like the wilderness.

{"author":"monsantobreath","body":"I'd say tactically it certainly can be relevant, but lets bear in mind this is I think clearly a liberal chart. It makes no mention of capitalism explicitly, only things liberals consider bad about its effect. Mentioning \"predatory lending\" implies a non predatory way to carry out business and that its not the entire system doing it. Chasing down the origins of this chart are sort of obscure but reveal the sort of sloppy way the internet works to create its library of motivational political images.\n\nSo starting with nothing but the source credit at the bottom I searched it out:\n\nIt was an image adapted from some organization called Safehouse progressive alliance for nonviolence. It was originally posted to their facebook page but I can't chase it down as apparently it was from 2005? SPAN as they call themselves is I think a pretty clearly liberal organization. Its a local community non violence and transition house operating in Boulder Colorado. Maybe they were more radical in 2005 but as of today they seem pretty standard reformist liberal 'work with local business leaders and politicians to effect change' types, on top of whatever other services they provide.\nhttp:\/\/www.safehousealliance.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/March-2018-Newsletter.pdf\n\n&gt;37th ANNUAL\nChocolate Lovers\u2019 Fling\nOn February 3rd, 2018 over 275\nSPAN supporters gathered at the Omni\nInterlocken Hotel and Resort to celebrate\nthe 37th Annual Chocolate Lovers\u2019 Fling.\nThis year the Fling raised nearly $200,000\nthe largest fund raising effort in the 37 year\nhistory of the event.\nDuring the evening guests enjoyed a\nwonderful assortment of local chocolates,\nsupplied by many long time supporters of\nthe Fling such as Chocolove, Breadworks,\nLift chocolates, Cholaca and many more.\nEach year, businesses and individuals\naround Boulder and Broomfield Counties\ncome together to support the Fling by\ndonating funds, items for the auction,\nproducts and services. The night entails a\nlive and silent auction, survivor presentation,\ngourmet dinner, dancing to the Mark\nDiamond Band, and LOTS of chocolate!\nIn one of his last public speaking\nengagements, attendees heard **District\nAttorney Stan Garnett** describe SPAN\u2019s\nwork in the community as \u201csupporting and\nchanging the lives of victims of intimate\npartner violence.\u201d\n\nhttp:\/\/www.safehousealliance.org\/about-span\/\n\n&gt;SPAN is a human rights organization committed to ending violence against adults, youth and children through support, advocacy, education and community organizing. SPAN began providing services in 1979 and is crucial to the network of support that offers critical \u201csafety net\u201d services to vulnerable, low-income and at-risk populations. It is the only organization serving Boulder, western Broomfield, smaller towns and unincorporated Boulder County designed to provide shelter and advocacy for victims of interpersonal violence at a time when our community is experiencing higher domestic violence rates than national and state averages.\n\n&gt;**SPAN\u2019s organizational goals are:**  \n**\u2013 Foster organizational excellence**  \n**\u2013 Provide meaningful and effective support and resources to adults, children and youth impacted by interpersonal violence**  \n**\u2013 Implement violence prevention initiatives that promote safety, dignity and liberation for all people**  \n**\u2013 Engage individuals, groups, policy makers and the community at large in efforts that promote economic, racial and social justice.**  \n\nNow back in August last year some woman named Ellen Tuzzolo posted the original chart to facebook. She seems nice enough but is just a small fry political activist white woman from RI doing local community work who seems to have emphasis on violence, justice, and race issues. Probably the more self aware end of white liberal politics I assume. Still not revolutionary. However it did apparently get noticed by some people and it ended up in an article in the HuffPost.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/entry\/how-does-white-supremacy-survive-an-education_us_59989344e4b033e0fbdec4ad\n\nAn alright mainstream article by a white teacher that doesn't touch again on anything to do directly with capitalism itself posted in the aftermath of Charlottesville, just mentions things like the issue with outcomes reinforcing racist assumptions, standardized testing, and denying the meritocracy nominally under a racist structure (not referring to actual economics directly). Makes no mention of the benefits of political engagement but again this is a white perspective. Repeatedly actually the chain is showing white people as the promoters of this chart. \n\nLastly the current incarnation of the image, reimagined to increase the controversy factor and extend the chart from simply contrasting overt and covert white supremacy into some kind of stratified 'leveling' of things, shows up here, with an adorable radical sounding vague quote:\n\n&gt;In a pyramid, every brick depends on the ones below it for support. If the bricks at the bottom are removed, the whole structure comes tumbling down.\n\nhttp:\/\/thesociologicalcinema.tumblr.com\/post\/169981461260\/pyramid-of-white-supremacy-in-a-pyramid-every\n\nNotice again the reimagined chart still lacks mention of capitalism. Apparently that foundation of racism is not relevant to ending white supremacy. So checking who posted it again the blog says: \n\n&gt;We're a ragtag team of three public sociologists hell bent on promoting video &amp; pop culture to teach sociology. Visit us at www.thesociologicalcinema.com.\n\nOkay so I did. No surprise they're white again. I think at this point we can safely ignore this chart as relevant to our particular outlook or really any anti capitalist one or to the radical end of black liberation either.

It happens to all living things and always has. It makes the continuation of a cycle of life happen by giving room for new life to blossom. As life takes from the universe, death gives back to it. You need death in order to live. \n\nWhat I also wonder about your prevention of death policies is how you incorporate new life to exist. Because surely if you really were wanting to extend life for so long, and so long to a point where people still felt relatively young, you'd need a mechanism to help control the birthrate. Just because people are old doesn't mean they don't want to stop having sex, and I'm sure that you wouldn't want to put a limiting mechanism in place for that. People will always want to have children, it's hardwired in their biology. The population would be all sorts of out-of-whack if no one or very few people died. That's not how you maintain an ecosystem - you have to give back to the area you live in somehow for it to be sustainable, otherwise you'll just collapse under your own weight of being.\n\nLike I said, you need death in order to live. \n\nThere comes a reasonable point where one can recognize that they have lived enough, fulfilled their purpose, and are ready to go.

The money raised can go to anything that is not a teachers salary: computers, sports equipment, building repairs or additions, supplies for students, extra curricular events\/activities, enrichment programming, libraries, maybe extra training for teachers, etc. etc. \n\nThis fundraising can be done by students, adminstration, parents or concerned members of the community (usually alumni, sometimes philanthropists). The targeted donors include parents, alumni, philanthropists, foundations and corporations. \n\nFor all the obvious reasons, schools with wealthy student populations are going to be much more successful at this sort of fundraising.\n\n(2) As jobs open at different schools, teachers move around. Experienced and talented teachers can be selective with where they teach. So, over time, quality of teachers can increase at wealthier schools because high quality teachers will migrate there. (I'm not sure why they do this... perhaps there are non-salary perks, perhaps they believe the work will be lower stress, perhaps (like a majority of the liberal middle class) they feel more comfortable and at-ease around wealthy and middle class people than poor and working class people).\n\nThe limited evidence I have suggests that this is not a huge factor (not nearly as big as #1 above), but it is a factor.\n\n(3) The adminstration's and parents of wealthy neighbourhood schools are very good at taking advantage of the plutocracy, patronage and cronyism that runs Canadian provincial governments.

{"author":"Aldrenean","body":"\/u\/assassinationmarket is correct about space exploration, specifically planetary terraforming and colonization, solving most of those problems. But there are also realistic ways to deal with the issue of overpopulation on Earth. \n\nFirst of all, we're not really that close to the carrying capacity of the planet, so long as we do things a lot more efficiently. If we moved the population mostly into arcologies, we would vastly increase efficiency while decreasing our environmental impact. New technologies like hydroponics and solar power would obviously be critical to success here. \n\nSecondly, *education solves for overpopulation*. This is true across the globe: the more well-educated a populace is, the lower their birth rate drops over time. This is why there's negative population growth in places like Japan (though Japan itself has some specific cultural factors also contributing). Now, will the desire to reproduce ever go away? I certainly hope not. But we already see the most educated people in first-world countries having a really small amount of children, and I really think that that birth rate would be sustainable, especially if a decent number of people voluntarily die every year -- a facet of this fantasy that you seem to be repeatedly ignoring: suicide would almost certainly be commonplace, destigmatized, and painless.\n\nMy point is that these hypotheticals are going to become less and less hypothetical moving forward, and there will come a time, maybe not during your life, when people really have the choice to stop aging and become immortal in a sense. My concern is how we will deal with that, which I consider a more useful view than \"death is natural and thus good\". As I said a few comments ago, something being natural is no indication of its moral worth. It is natural for males in the animal kingdom to eat the young of other males. It is natural for human males to physically dominate human females. It is natural for the strong to inherit the earth, and the weak to be driven off and die. None of these things are what I would call \"good\", and I strongly doubt you would either, as you're posting on \/r\/anarchism. ","created_utc":1524503811,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"HeloRising","body":"Nuclear energy has a few key problems from my perspective.\n\n1. Non-zero probability of an accident. Anything built *will* fail given enough time. Anyone telling you different is lying. I will agree 100% that nuclear energy has a generally safe record when it comes to actual loss of human life. However, even with such a small potential for disaster the actual outcome of that disaster can be quite catastrophic. Failure states for renewable sources are not even remotely as catastrophic.\n\n2. Proliferation of nuclear materials. We still live in a world bent on conflict and nuclear material is a component that can be utilized for peaceful power generation or to destroy. Even spent fuel can be utilized to manufacture deadly explosives or depleted uranium shells. I'm not comfortable having more of that gallivanting around especially when we've proven so clearly that we can't keep it safe. Proliferation also increases the chances of industrial accidents along the lines of Fukushima. The more material we've got moving around the greater chance there is for something to go wrong with it and for it to end up in a major source of drinking water or river source.\n\n3. Lack of storage\/recycle options. We can recycle a good deal of nuclear waste but there's still a lot left where our best guess at what to do is [dig a big fucking hole in the ground and bury it.](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository) That's not exactly responsible ecology. It also feeds into the proliferation problem.\n\n4. We don't fucking need it. Look, renewable energy is hard but we *can* satisfy our energy demands if we stop this pretense that we can save ourselves with \"clean\" coal. I don't have the energy to do the math at the moment but if we took renewable energy seriously, reduced the cost of solar, allowed for greater use of other methods, we could feasibly eliminate our need to have other sources except for emergency backups.\n\nWhy would we choose a method of energy generation that produces toxic waste that we can't treat and has the potential to have a serious accident that could, at best, contaminate huge swathes of land and water, not to mention be turned into a weapon when we could utilize renewable energy?\n\nI realize it's more complex than that but that, in a nutshell, is why I'm not for the use of nuclear power.\n\nWe also need to keep in mind that much of the energy demand we have today is driven by the existence of a capitalist society that is so zealously over-consumptive as to be wildly unsustainable. When that is corrected, I think we may find our energy needs will adjust.","created_utc":1524568404,"score":4,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Of course, the federal structure of the IWW is there to provide help and advice, and the same goes for branches close-by or across the world (the IWW is growing strong in the UK and Germany as well, for example).\n\nWhat people are doing is that they are either joining general membership branches as lone members, the one in their city or their general geographic area.

{"author":"KnaveBB","body":"Anarchism has no laws. There's no private property so there can be no theft. Everyone has access to what they need or want, and if they don't have access they are empowered to create the means of access cooperatively. Nobody has authority over anyone else, so a court system has no place in an anarchist system, it wouldn't make sense. We first need to examine what would even constitute a crime in such a society. \n\nAs it exists today, our society is a perfect chemical reaction to breed violence. Sexual violence, class violence, structural violence etc. So much of what makes people lash out is the lack of resources and triggering stressors such as poverty, lack of nutrition, lack of medical care, poor housing, poisonous elements in the air, water and food supply and so forth. Give everyone what they need, along with agency and true freedom to self-actualize and you will immediately do away with most \"crime.\"\n\nSome will argue that human nature is brutish and violent and you'll always have \"bad apples.\" I would disagree, but let's look at violence in an anarchist society, just for argument's sake. If a member of a community enacts violence against another member, there is no reason to disbelieve the survivor. They have no incentive to lie. There is nothing to be gained, since everyone has equal access to all resources. Everyone is free to associate or not with whomever they choose. So it's up to the community to decide what to do. They can engage in transformative justice, whereby the healing process of the survivor takes precedence instead of the punishment of the aggressor.\n\nWhat about murder? What if, for whatever reason, someone in an anarchist society wants to become a serial killer? First, it's unlikely as they have no incentive and the stressors that trigger most serial killers don't exist. Every benefit is available to all members who wish to participate cooperatively. But for sake of argument we'll say someone is killing people. \n\nIn an open, borderless, shared society, it's actually much more difficult to get away with that kind of thing anonymously. Instead of atomized strangers in a defensive, self-centered capitalist system, an anarchist system encourages mutual aid, cooperation and solidarity. People know each other and interact regularly if they choose. People are sociable by nature, and an anarchism gives us the freedom to be fully and truly social.\n\nAny murderer would be hard pressed to go on a rampage and get away with it. If a person proves themselves to be a dangerous individual with nothing but murder in their hearts, direct action allows a group to just get rid of them if they want. No laws means a community can take care of itself in an equal and transparent way.","created_utc":1524576602,"score":7,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

This is libertarian (the bad, US kind) morality. Just because we're anarchists doesn't mean we need to forget about class politics and collectivism. We will NEVER defeat the ruling class and transform society if we act as individuals; we MUST unite to win. This requires a transformation not only of our tactics and organization but also of ourselves as people-- we must become collective in spirit.\n\n&gt;Folks should come together only when they agree on the reason. If there's a substantive split the answer is not to force the minority to submit, but simply for the group itself to split and for folks to go their own ways.\n\nAnarchists can come together collectively as anarchists, with the common goal of abolishing hierarchy in all its forms. There can still be disagreements about tactics, planning, and even long-term strategy, but decisions will have to be made and carried out by people appointed collectively, within, e.g. one of these shifting collectives you're talking about. This does not necessarily imply non-consensual governance, it just means that anarchists should weigh their grievances with a particular strategy against the need for collective action. If someone proposes something that is against the core spirit of anarchism in a general assembly, of course that should denied. But if the assembly appoints some people to carry out a task like, say, acquiring materials to build a greenhouse, and these people buy some materials that piss off 20% of the group, this kind of disagreement has to be weathered. *There must be avenues for dispute resolution beyond splitting and leaving*. Splitting off will only create a weak, fractured movement.\n\nBasically, I'm all for shifting collectives united through association. But these collectives must be big enough to dominate the politics of a given locality, in order to defeat capitalists, fascists, and Marxist-Leninist types. Sure, general assemblies in New York could be broken into an assembly for each neighborhood, which might each be the size of a single general assembly for a small town in Ohio.  Within these assemblies, you can have several or many smaller groups working on different things, but it is important to have the larger level of organization. \n\nIf anarchists are to win, we need to be able to coordinate things on all scales-- at the global level, regional level, and local level. Individualism and constant splitting will never deliver the kind of society we want to see.\n\nThis doesn't mean democratic centralism, which I vehemently oppose. It means figuring out ways to collectively act that do not create hierarchical and oppressive structures.\n\n*when the union's inspiration through the worker's blood shall run \/ there can be no power greater anywhere under the sun \/ and what force on earth is weaker, than the feeble strength of one? \/ but the union makes us strong!*","created_utc":1524583065,"score":24,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

U-232 has a decay sequence that includes the hard gamma-ray-emitting radioisotopes bismuth-212 and thallium-208. Indeed, the half-life of U-232 is short enough that this decay chain begins to set up within days of the purification of the uranium, and within a few months that gamma-ray flux from the material is intense. **These gamma rays destroy the electronics of a nuclear weapon, compromise the chemical explosives, and clearly signal to detection systems where the fissile material is located.** This is one of the key reasons why no operational nuclear weapons have ever been built using uranium-233 as the fissile material.\n\n-----------------------\n\n&gt;You want to pollute the ocean with vitrified radioactive waste.\n\nThe Kola Superdeep Borehole would work as well. \n\n","created_utc":1524592259,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"CosmicRaccoonCometh","body":"I think you are misunderstanding Stirner. It isn't so much that Stirner was against revolution as much as he didn't believe that revolution was capable of fixing the issues of mass society. Stirner's ideas are a challenge to the structures upon which any mass society rests, including a so called \"revolutionary\" one. His interest isn't in protecting society from revolution, but in warning people about the dangers of seeing a \"revolutionary\" society as inherently different than other societies. It isn't a philosophy of inaction, it is one of immediate and unending action based on one's unique desires, rather than allowing oneself to be shaped by faith and belief in the constructs upon which mass society always rests. \n\nAlso, the assertion that Nietzsche and Stirner were the precursor of Rand is kind of shaky -- but, even if they were, they were also the precursor of Wolfi Landstreicher and Novatore (as well as many others) -- and pointing out how one person interpreted or used their ideas is not an argument against them.

{"author":"Jouissance_juice","body":"Okay, everyone ITT who is not knee-jerk condemning blockchain is getting downvoted to oblivion. So allow me to walk into the gauntlet.\n\nBlockchain is incredibly subversive. while currencies like BTC and ETH have been allowed to exist, as it is not *illegal* to operate parallel currencies within our economic model, they have been both acquired for control and marginalized by the banking cartel. JPMC, CapOne and BofA come to mind as banks that have restricted purchase of Crypto products on major platforms such as Coinbase. Why?\n\nThe reason is, a bitcoin has less in common with a dollar than it does win an actual bank. Eth can even carry out automated transactions and create it's own currency like a bank. If implemented correctly, blockchain technology could be used to subvert the banking cartel. \n\nUp until this point, Crypto has been sort of a gross capitalistic cash grab. But that doesn't take away it's subversive potential. People are just ignorant as to what it is and how it should work to bypass centralized banking, if for no other reason than it is decentralized. \n\nI haven't looked into this OSG project, but I will. Personally I think blockchain has the capability of overthrowing the centralized banking system. Whether that potential is actually realized is yet to be seen.","created_utc":1524616163,"score":-2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}
{"author":"CosmicRaccoonCometh","body":"These examples are kind of interesting here, because some of them are quite different than the others, and I'm interested how you think some of these would play out. \n\nLike, the garbage pickup thing. So, if a certain area votes a certain amount of garbage pickup, then what? Are the one's voting for it going to do it, or are they going to compel certain individuals to do it? And by what mechanism are they going to compel the individuals to do it? And if they aren't compelling any body to do it, then what is the need of the vote at all? \n\nOn the environment, my main thought is that any central mechanism for protecting the environment is something I would advise against, since that is something that is so prone to becoming caught up by regulatory capture to become a mechanism of defending polluters against environmental activists, rather than the other way around. I think less restrained activism would be a much stronger incentive to get people to be willing to seek cooperative environmental standards with those they share an area with. \n\nSomething like displacing people in for infrastructure projects is tough. What I imagine is that whoever is doing and supportive of the project try to come to an understanding with those they are displacing, and I think  if there is a willingness on the part of the people doing the project to strive for understanding, that more often than not one could be reached . But if, at the end of the day,  the price for not having centralization is less large scale infrastructure, that's a price I would be happy to pay and which I think is much more conducive to a hierarchically resistant way of life. \n\nI guess overall I have sort of a taoist perspective that trying hard to create and impose a systemic solution to issues is actually counterproductive to finding solutions to those issues -- or, put another way, that the process and mechanisms created in order to have a sense of security in being able to attain solutions creates conflicts and relations that produce a dynamic that itself becomes the most substantial barrier for attaining the conditions where solutions are possible.

But this is not a picture of a community police force (even if it's all the same guys you would regularly see walking around town helping old ladies cross the street).\n\nOfficer friendly is nowhere to be found in that crowd. There are a number of dark, powerful forces at work in the human psyche that will allow otherwise \"good\" human beings to commit horrible acts of violence and cruelty without remorse when conditions are right. And here we have a perfect storm of the top three.\n\n1. Anonymity, freedom from social repercussions against the individual. Their faces and figures are obfuscated by tactical gear, they may have name tags or p-numbers on there somewhere, but in a crowd, with smoke, potentially behind shields, no one is going to catch that.\n\n2. Uniformity, similar to and interconnected with (but also distinct from) item one. The uniform creates an \"in\" group, and where you have an \"in\" group you have an \"out\" group. Which in this case is anyone not wearing black tactical gear. And let's be candid, we don't so much mind when a member of an \"out\" group meets a violent end... As an aside, having spent a number of years living in rural towns with just a local sheriff and a few deputies, I can tell you that you don't need a uniform to spot LE. A star and a gun will do.

But where I'm in perfect agreement with these gentleman is that an \"active\" military force (not the men who don the uniform, but the unit) has no place among the citizens they are bound too.

The money supply is something that can be attacked, and it's one less weapon you can be attacked with. Blockchain is utilized incorrectly by capitalism, which is why a lot of people on the left are justifiably skeptical of it. But capitalism values everything wrong anyway.\n\nLet me ask you a question. Is a sufficiently advanced society possible without a ledger of some kind? Some record of tracking where goods came from, and where they are going? At the very least this can be accomplished with blockchain without relying on banks to finance a venture or a government to manage it. It decentralizes sophisticated financial tools, that may be valuable for social applications other than capital accumulation.\n\nIs there a potential for abuse? Yes. Just like everything else. My point is that if you are thinking of blockchain like money then you are thinking of it like a capitalist. \n\nAnd just to be clear, I don't own a single Bitcoin, or Etherium or anything, I'm skeptical of those devices for their corruption by or association with capital that I think is baked into the DNA of those particular devices. But the technology exists now, it's basically the internet of the 1980's, it has overwhelming potential, it's just Noone \nappreciates it.\n\nEdit I guess my point here is: if you're being economically oppressed, stop using their economy. Better yet, use a more advanced economy.

Personally I think coordinating our efforts with interuptive technologies could be a means to achieve that. But I think I'm in the minority.\n\n&gt;Also, regarding terminology, \"commodifying\" things is basically about giving them a value, so that they can be traded as a commodity.\n\nRight, giving them a monetary value. But what is the value of a commodity? Does steel get it's value from its extrinsic worth? Or does it have a social value as a resource? A ceramic cup might only be valued at a few dollars, but its social value is measured in its ability to hold liquid for consumption. This is the crux of what I'm trying to get it: I don't care what a crypto currency is valued in trade, in which instance it becomes just another financial tool, a bourgeois means of extracting capital.

{"author":"Tefal","body":"&gt; As a trans girl leninist this is one of the worst comments I've read in a good while. First of, we should not give a platform to people who are actively transphobic and to pedophile rape role-players.\n\nAgreed on the idea of not giving a platform to the propagators of transphobia, doubly so if they do it as part of their public discourse like Jason does IIRC. As for FinBol, considering what little I could read of the circumstances, calling him a pedophile over some *seriously weird* but apparently consensual tankie ERP with a girl in her late teens in a semiprivate channel on Discord, with him being in his early twenties, is pushing it very far. Looks to me like it's about making an eyebrow-raising, ethically questionable thing into moral outrage.\n\n&gt; It's not about purity(anyone who accuses people of wanting \"purity\" is a nitwit), it's about keeping community members safer.\n\nYou might not be calling it purity, yet it is a similar concept: expecting comrades to speak and act in an ideologically and morally correct manner at all times, both in public and in private. Offenses are replied to with moral outrage; the uproar over Chelsea Manning hanging out with alt-rightoids is a good example of this. Repeat offenders are ostracized and traces of their existence often removed as a sort of [damnatio memoriae](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Damnatio_memoriae).\n\nI believe this expectation to be unrealistic. As it goes, we are all human with our faults and all engage in problematic behavior at one time or the other; in my opinion, those that appear \"better\" in discourse and behavior do so mostly because they manage to hide their fuckups better than others. FinBol's case is an absolute failure in doing so.\n\nThe people within the left causing issues ought to be vigorously called out, engaged with, encouraged to self-criticize and better themselves. That includes not giving them a platform and\/or not unconditionally trusting them as required, but notice the difference between this and moral outrage followed by banning and ignoring: the latter is an extremely divisive tactic that leads to massive splintering and the decomposition of any community into a number of splinter groups with the characteristics of both an echo chamber and a cult.\n\n&gt; Second of all, you are clueless if you think they give an accurate picture of the \"Bolsheviks and the Soviet Union\". They are both Stalinists known to quote mine to fit their own narrative. Just read a book or two instead of waiting for some dudebro on youtube to spoon feed you with false information.\n\nI don't want to be spoon-fed anything by FinBol, even less by Jason and *expect* them to quote mine and push their narrative. That is exactly what I want when I listen to them. They provide insight on the way tankies think and, in the case of FinBol, the inner workings of authoritarian M-L states from their internal \"official\" perspective. That is not exactly usable as life guidance, but pretty useful - I'd like to understand why and when the USSR and the various others M-L states failed and contrasting the various perspectives on what went wrong, even the one from the guys saying it all went *right*, is good.\n\nIn short, I do not think that Jason and FinBol should be promoted or endorsed, but acknowledging their existence and the issues surrounding them is a matter of honesty.","created_utc":1524655122,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

They're putting faith in trustless audited code.\n\nIf the Apache nation people want to create an isolated sub-economy based on Ethereum contracts, they must go about it in one of two ways:\n\n1. Buy a bunch of computers, buy networking infrastructure, and buy electricity (or power plants) to run a large number of Ethereum nodes on the network, and then program the Dapps that define their economy. That is a large initial investment of fiat currency required on their behalf, and the upkeep for all this technology isn't free either. Not to mention the large cost of gas to write the Dapp to the blockchain.\n\n2. If they can't afford that, they need to buy Ethereum services from brokers who can run all the technology for them. But without the expertise to verify that their contracts are being executed correctly, they have to **trust** that the brokers are honest and not ripping them off.\n\nIf they go with strategy #1, they don't need to trust anyone, but the cost of operating the network will be very large. Computers break down and need to be replaced. (Will they buy computers with Ethereum?) People need to be trained to understand the software, to apply patches as upgrades come in. People need to be trained to write and maintain Dapps. All this expense for what? What advantage does it have over a much cheaper and simpler paper-based economic island?\n\nBut it was *you* who said that computers weren't necessary for this form of economy. So without computers, how do you participate in a cryptocurrency network? Like I said, the code has to run on someone's computer. So that would be strategy #2 above: relying on **trusted** brokers to participate in the Ethereum network on their behalf. But obviously that defeats the purpose of using a trustless blockchain to begin with.\n\nWhich means the original questions I asked haven't been answered yet: what is the point of using a blockchain at all?","created_utc":1524655995,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"leftcommunists","body":"&gt;Agreed on the idea of not giving a platform to the propagators of transphobia, doubly so if they do it as part of their public discourse like Jason does IIRC. As for FinBol, considering what little I could read of the circumstances, calling him a pedophile over some seriously weird but apparently consensual tankie ERP with a girl in her late teens in a semiprivate channel on Discord, with him being in his early twenties, is pushing it very far.

As it goes, we are all human with our faults and all engage in problematic behavior at one time or the other; in my opinion, those that appear \"better\" in discourse and behavior do so mostly because they manage to hide their fuckups better than others. FinBol's case is an absolute failure in doing so.\n\nIt's not unrealistic, like most people manage to not play out rape fantasies through ERP, most people manage to not be raging transphobes, most people manage to not hang out with a bunch of alt-righeters(and then lie about why!) and so on. \n\n&gt;In short, I do not think that Jason and FinBol should be promoted or endorsed, but acknowledging their existence and the issues surrounding them is a matter of honesty.\n\nIt is a very online thing to say that we need to remember them or say that they exist.

{"author":"RetroLovejoy","body":"No it isn't, it doesn't seek to glorify anyone, and it seeks to empower the oppressed. When industrial work was the major form of production in the Europe\/US was when syndicalist movements focused on industrial workers (hence the I in IWW) because they a were large and explicitly exploited group at the time. Note that workers in other aspects in life were largely ignored, and other anarchists focused their efforts elsewhere (like in education and the condition of immigrants). The criticism was sarcasm in response to the fact that the poster above me received a large amount of downvotes for pointing out that fetishizing the concerns of past movements, and certain classifications of people ('worker') misses the point of anarchism by being so narrowly focused. My sarcasm was in agreement pointing out that we should focus on freeing ourselves from the conditions of labor and the identity of worker. Said identity has had the problem of being idealized by anarchists and marxists who look on the past with rose tinted glasses and think the contemporary situation of economic production and social existence is that same as it once was, dogmatically following the words and critiques of the dead without conceiving that things might now be different.\n\nThe 'not really' in above's post is in regard the the fact that Catalonia not only failed badly, but was also heavily compromised, resulting in only a few instances of anarchism in line with itself that ultimately were underwritten by the plays of violence and power. The second half of above's post concerned work - the main focus of the Catalonian movement (being that it was mostly syndicalist) - and whose content consisted of a critique that says you shouldn't glorify the worker (which labor movements do). In this there is the implication that said glorifying raises (which is was glorifying does) the worker categorically above anyone that doesn't fit in with that category. This creates a dominant form of being and a subservient other resulting in the reformulation of hierarchy (the subversion of which is actually what anarchism wants to do). Which itself is a critique of the Catalonian movement due to its focus.","created_utc":1524672573,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"DenverHoxha","body":"&gt;Right, giving them a monetary value. But what is the value of a commodity? Does steel get it's value from its extrinsic worth? Or does it have a social value as a resource? A ceramic cup might only be valued at a few dollars, but its social value is measured in its ability to hold liquid for consumption. This is the crux of what I'm trying to get it: I don't care what a crypto currency is valued in trade, in which instance it becomes just another financial tool, a bourgeois means of extracting capital. I'm concerned with how it can be used to build social value, without relying on capital.\n\nCryptocurrencies are currencies. They value things exactly the same way markets do under capitalism (give or take some fucking legendary levels of fraud and market manipulation). It's just another kind of money. It doesn't introduce any socialist elements into an economy whatsoever. \n\n&gt;My point is, banks are just data entries, a complex set of ledgers. \n\nAgain, this is just wrong. That's not what banks are and it's not what they do. Banks use ledgers, but so do every other corporation, and neither could be replaced by an elaborate spreadsheet. A blockchain cannot lend you money, operate a savings account for you or facilitate debit\/credit card networks - to do that you need whole other systems which add a whole other degree of cost and centralization to the system.\n\n&gt;As to your last point, you make my point. I think we have a fundamental disagreement about the necessity of banks. The monetary system is strangling society. It is the heart, pumping the black blood of capitalism. I mean, you're on an anarchist sub arguing for the need of financial service providers. Is this your first day? \n\nWhoa bud. You might want to learn what a bank is before you decide to get all condescending about it. My point was that an economic system based on blockchain is going to need financial services just like one based around traditional money. I'm not saying \"I like banks\", I'm just not delusional enough to think that a monetary system is going to function without them, or something very similar. Capitalism is not awful because of banks, banks are one of the many awful parts of capitalism. \n\n&gt;The experiments that are being run with crypto are worthy of analysis. The vanguard of any capitalist venture will have blood on its hands, that's what it does. If capitalists lose capital as a result of shady financial dealings, that is not my concern. But the idea that they can be used to track the economic activity of an advanced society without the use of traditional currency is what I find interesting and subversive.\n\nThe crypto world absolutely should be studied. I follow it compulsively, and there's a lot to learn from it. The entire endeavour has been a spectacular failure in just about every regard and anarchists should probably understand why, if only to help guard against similarly half-baked ideas in the future.

However, your understanding of anarchism is a completely off the mark. Anarchism opposes the institutionalized or socially accepted use of power to make decisions, give orders and enforce obedience. We're against the active use of power to dominate others as opposed to the reactive use of violence in *self defense* or the pursuit of justice.

Now you're changing it to \"enforcement of social norms on unwilling adults is government,\" which is also false. A group of people who capture a murderer and prosecute him is not a government. Similarly, a group that fights against authority and \"enforces\" an environment where the active use of power to dominate others is curtailed through force cannot be called a government. Certain social norms such as *a priori* property rights require a government to enforce, but not all enforcement is carried out by governments. You're making a logical mistake. \n\nA government actively manages the day-to-day lives of people. The definition of government is: the group of people with the authority to govern a country or state; a particular ministry in office. Anarchists propose that no single body govern individuals and would instead advocate for decentralized self-governance without a supervisory body to make give orders and enforce obedience with a few exceptions for those who attempt to harm others or subjugate others, which can be justified as self-defense.\n\n&gt;Trial by jury? Well, that's a government. \n\nNo it isn't. You actually do seem to think that all structure is a government.\n\n\n\n","created_utc":1524710211,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

It is just like Bitcoin (less a few mathematical details) but has an added feature that basically lets you store a computer program into the blockchain, and then pay an amount of money to have the entire network execute the program for you and store the result into the blockchain, ensuring that the result is correct, tamper-proof, and public for all to see. The amount you pay is proportional to the computational complexity of the program, and although the way complexity is measured is somewhat arbitrary, it's fair enough.\n\nSo as a result, you can program things like fully peer-to-peer, decentralized casinos where cheating is practically impossible. You can also do things like online voting. **Any system** where a public, tamper-proof computer program needs to run in order for it to be trusted, Ethereum can do it for you.\n\nThat said, blockchain technology still has some major technical hurdles to overcome, namely the amount of electricity it is consuming, and it is a problem that the size of the blockchain data grows without bound, if slowly. Also there are economic challenges, namely the problem with speculative bubbles. If these issues can be addressed, I think the technology will be here to stay.\n\nBut people talking like blockchain technology can replace government is just about the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. Government is by people for people, it is not by *computers* for people, or by *the technocratic elite* for people.

Libertarian socialists advocate for decentralized structures based on direct democracy and federal or confederal associations such as libertarian municipalism, citizens' assemblies, trade unions and workers' councils.

I brought it up because it is a system you are personally more seperated from, and I was hoping you'd be able to see it more clearly than how you see the one you are actually a part of\n\nYet you did not present it as an analogy to consider. You very clearly wanted me to answer your rhetorical question. However the system is not the analogy, so while I did consider the ramifications of any answer I gave to other situations, I decided that the analogy did not accurately or fairly portray the conditions of the matter at hand. In other words, it was a leading question which I felt no obligation to treat as an honest question.\n\n&gt; No one has to be a **worker**. Not one person ever had to be a **worker** or starve. Never.\n\nI would just like to point out that this is demonstrably false. You would be surprised with how poverty can push people into undesirable jobs.\n\n&gt; because you are either a cop trying to rationalize what you do, or you are just a boot licking apologist for cops for other reasons\n\nMy \"other reasons\" is that I recognize the difference between people and systems. Systems create the conditions necessary for the outcomes that we see more than individual actions do. Consider how these people, police officers, wouldn't be police if they had been born under different conditions, like say in an anarchist society. To say that these people are bastards is to ignore the difference between the person and the system that molded them. If we don't like these actions, getting mad at the individuals or groups of individuals does nothing to change the system and shifts our focus away from societal action to individual action. In other words, if we change the system we change behaviors, thus getting upset at behaviors in and of themselves is pointless and counter-productive.\n\nI also found your attempt to just try and pass off disagreement as one side being objectively right and the other as being necessarily biased is intellectually dishonest and argumentatively lazy.

{"author":"backwardsmiley","body":"&gt;why have they never lived without hierarchy?\n\nNope, this is just more of your ignorance on the topic coming through. As I've already pointed out there are numerous examples of societies that have been and currently are based on anarchist principles including the Zapatistas in Mexico, Rojava, Revolutionary Catalonia, Israeli Kibbutz, the free software movement, the Free territories in Ukraine, the Shinmin prefecture in South Korea and Zomia (a region with 80-100 million living in uplands South East Asia). There are multiple indigenous societies that organize non-hierarchically including the !kung, the San people and hundreds of others tribes from Madagascar to Polynesia. These people tend to avoid conflict since each individual in society is unwilling to die for abstract goals. As I have already said, the anthropological consensus is that hunter-gatherer societies were largely anarchistic, which means that we lived according to anarchist principles for most of our history. Finally, there are hundreds of anarchist squats and temporary autonomous zones around the world from ZAD to Exarchia, often housing hundreds of people all organizing without coercing each other.\n\n&gt;Why do the apes from which we come never live without hierarchy?\n\nBecause humans aren't chimps. Making distinctions and avoiding false equivalences has proven difficult for you so I understand that you might not be able to see the difference.\n\n&gt;Who performs the specialized forensic analysis to determine if the suspect is a murderer? Well you probably need to train someone very well. Suddenly you have something very much like a government role. \n\nNeither training nor forensics requires a government. In the early US detective work was carried out by the Pinkertons. Small communities had no need for police and delegated defense needs to associations of workers.\n\n&gt;I guess the fundamental difference between you and I is: you think people can become much closer to perfect in their behavior and intents, much more compliant and less selfish. \n\nAnarchism is the exact opposite of compliance. It's about individuals taking back control over their lives from the state and capital.\n\n&gt;And also Unachievable Human Cooperation. If humans were inclined to cooperate without competition, why have they never lived without hierarchy?\n\nHierarchy is not contingent on competition, you're making another false equivalence. Competition does not lead to government and could exist under an anarchist framework. Elinor Olstrom, a recipient of the nobel prize in economics, demonstrated that people with a shared interest in maintaining the commons typically derive and hold each other mutually accountable to set of rules regarding the management of the commons without the use of violence. The people making these rules could be competing with each other in a free market of working cooperatively to utilize the commons, but the same principle applies. Conversely a private corporation is protected by the state and cannot be held accountable for it's actions by local communities, leading to the tragedy of the commons.\n\n","created_utc":1524738542,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

The Years of Lead are considered to have begun with the death of the policeman Antonio Annarumma who was killed in a leftist demonstration in November 1969, and the Piazza Fontana bombing in December that year, which killed 17, both in Milan.\n\nThe term's origin possibly came as a reference to the vast number of bullets fired during the period, or a popular 1981 German film Marianne and Juliane, released in Italy as Anni di piombo, which centered on the lives of two members of the West German militant far-left group Red Army Faction which had gained notoriety during the same period.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1524750911,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

The bourgeois revolutions that established the principles of liberalism effectively replaced the superhuman recognised in monarchs with the \"nation\" in which we are all \"citizens\", whose every right can only be granted by the superhuman state. Under liberalism we are all bound to the state, the individual can only be recognised in its relation to it, that of a citizen who must obey laws.\n\nCops don't protect people, they protect the superhuman above them, the state, they protect \" law and order\", as defined by the state, if \"the people\" are committing a crime the police will be deployed to stop them, killing them if necessary. \n\nWhen they arrest shoplifters or squatters they are enforcing laws that protect individuals based on rights the state grants to those who own property. If you own a sweatshop and the workers strike and seize your factory the cops will quash the strikers for you, because all of that is recognized as your property by law, by the state who holds a monopoly of violence over all of its citizens.\n\nAny institution that enforces \"laws\" in a society describes an authority coercing individuals into adhering to its rules, it is necessarily coercive and not anarchist. We don't need laws to know what's right and wrong despite being told so, just like the catholic church would tell us we need religion as a value system to know what's moral, but we don't, people know rape, murder, and theft are wrong, with or without law.

There are certainly some messages about how the movement has evolved, but I don't think the author's intention was to say that they were two wholly separate movements. I think that sentence is simply saying that there is no 'historical connection', meaning you cannot trace an unbroken line of leftist anti-fascist collectives from one movement to another. He seems to indicate that the movements have the same goals, symbolism, and essential make up:\n\n&gt;Antifascism has surged to the fore of debates on the American left under Trump\u2019s presidency, and many of the tactics and visual styles of the German Antifa can be seen emerging in cities like Berkeley and elsewhere. Some argue that with the arrival of European-style neo-fascist movements on American shores, it is also time to import European Antifa tactics in response.\n\n&gt;Yet the Antifa of today is not a product of a political victory from which we can draw our own strength, but of defeat \u2014 socialism\u2019s defeat at the hands of Nazism and resurgent global capitalism, and later the exhaustion of the autonomist movement in the wake of the neoliberal turn and the sweeping gentrification of many German cities.\n\nIn this passage he strongly ties today's American antifa to the *entire history* of leftist struggle in Europe, tying a clear line of goals and describing how the movement has evolved through its own success and defeats to become what it is today.\n\n&gt;Of course, the Antifa\u2019s experience in 1945 offers us equally few concrete lessons for how to fight a resurgent far right in the Trump era. Looking back at the history of the socialist left is not about distilling victorious formulas to be reproduced in the twenty-first century, but rather understanding how previous generations understood their own historical moment and built political organizations in response, in order to develop our own (hopefully more successfully models) for today.\n\nAnd again, here, he refers to one antifa, learning from its experience in 1945 to grow current, better models for today.\n\nI might be interpreting what I want, but I believe that a movement that uses the same symbols, has the same goals, has the same name, uses similar tactics, and is made up of similar-minded leftists doesn't need a complete unbroken history to be the same group.

{"author":"Siantlark","body":"I formatted it for easy reading. Here is some background for people out of the loop. [South China Morning Post](http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/china\/society\/article\/2143204\/chinese-students-push-back-against-peking-university-metoo), [The Telegraph](https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/2018\/04\/09\/chinese-professor-sacked-sexual-assault-claim-chinas-metoo-struggles\/) or [Xinhua](http:\/\/www.xinhuanet.com\/english\/2018-04\/08\/c_137095959.htm). \n\nBasic jist of what happened is that it recently came out that a professor sexually assaulted a student in 1998. The student committed suicide as a result, but the professor was allowed to keep teaching and the incident was swept under the rug. The response from students, understandably, is one of outrage and horror. \n\nHere's the actual blockchain letter: \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nPeking University teachers and classmates:\n\nHow are you!\n\nI am Yueluo from the 2014 Foreign Languages Institute. I was one of the eight students who submitted the \u201cInformation Disclosure Application Form\u201d to Peking University on the morning of April 9. I dragged my tired body and wrote this text to illustrate some of the things that have happened to me recently.\n\n\n  After April 9th, I was constantly interviewed by faculty members and leaders of the college, and it continued twice until midnight or even \n  During the conversation, the student teacher repeatedly mentioned \"Can you graduate successfully,\" \"Do what your mother and grandmother do,\" and \"Student teacher has the right not to contact you directly by your parents.\" While I was preparing my graduation thesis recently, frequent interruptions and subsequent psychological pressures severely affected my thesis writing.\n\n At noon on April 20, I received a reply from the school. The Secretary of the Party Committee of the School of Foreign Languages, the teacher of the Xuegong and the head teacher were present. The secretary of the Party Committee read to me the answer to the open information application of the school:\n\n&gt;1. Discussing that Shenyang Shide's meeting level is not enough\n\n&gt;2. The investigation results of the Public Security Bureau are not in the scope of school management\n\n&gt;3. The content of the public review in Shenyang was not found due to work errors in the Chinese Department.\n\nThe result of this reply disappointed me. However, the submission of graduation thesis will soon be closed, I can only focus on thesis writing.\n\n\nAt about 11 pm on April 22, the counselor suddenly called me, but because the time was late, I did not receive it. At one o'clock in the morning, the counselor and his mother suddenly came to my dormitory and forced me to wake up and asked me to delete all the information related to the information disclosure incident on my mobile phone and computer. After dawn, I went to the teacher to make a written guarantee Involved in this matter. Students on the same floor can testify. Later, I was taken home by my parents and I can't return to school at the moment.\n\nMy mother and I were awake all night. Schools misrepresented the facts when they contacted their mothers, causing mothers to be overly frightened and emotionally collapsed. Because of the unreasonable intervention of the school, my relationship with my mother was almost broken. The current action of the college has already broken the bottom line. I feel fear and anger.\n\nWhat is the crime of applying for information disclosure? I did not do anything wrong, nor would I regret having submitted the \"Information Disclosure Application Form\" to exercise my honorable rights as a college student in Beijing.\nTwenty years of envy, I love my mother. In the face of her sorrowful cry, self-sacrifice, kneeling requests, and threats of suicide, my heart is bleeding. In her plea, I can only return home temporarily, but I can't stand back from principle. Compromise can't solve any problems. I have no choice but to write this statement and state the story.\nEmotional, please forgive me for being incoherent.\n\n\nHere, I formally submitted the following demands to the School of Foreign Languages \u200b\u200bof Peking University:\n\n1. The School of Foreign Languages \u200b\u200bof Peking University should openly state in writing the rules and regulations on which I have pressured parents, forced me to interview me in the morning and asked me to delete the relevant information on the disclosure of application information. Illegal and non-compliance operations should be clearly defined during this process. And take measures to prevent such incidents from happening again.\n2. The Peking University School of Foreign Languages \u200b\u200bshould immediately cease all acts of pressure on my family, formally apologize to my already frightened mother, clarify the facts, and help repair the family tension caused by the incident.\n3. The School of Foreign Languages \u200b\u200bof Peking University must make an open written guarantee that this matter will not affect my graduation and will not continue to interfere with my dissertation writing process.\n4. The School of Foreign Languages \u200b\u200bof Peking University is responsible for eliminating all adverse effects of this matter on my studies, future employment and family members.\n5. The School of Foreign Languages \u200b\u200bof Peking University should make a clear written response to the appeal and give it to everyone concerned.\nI will retain all legal rights to further investigate the responsibilities of relevant individuals and units, including but not limited to reporting to Peking University and higher authorities the serious violation of school regulations by the Foreign Language Institute.\n\nPeking University School of Foreign Languages\n\nApril 23, 2018\n\n&gt;

Because property includes the means to sustain life, control of it is control of the people who need to use it. Amassing more property is amassing more control.\n\nSince even good, 'lawful' people will choose to violate private property norms in the face of starvation and death, to absolutely control property beyond your personal sphere of awareness means to hire additional force to keep people off. This requires an apparatus parallel to the state.\n\nMoreover, because property is amoral, property earned with misdeeds spends just as well. The capitalists who squeeze workers the hardest and cheat the best outcompete the ones who treat workers kindly because they have both 'ethical' and 'unethical' revenue streams, and there's no backlash that can reach them because they control the means of sustaining life through a violent hierarchical apparatus.

{"author":"Anarcho_Cyndaquilist","body":"Anarchism is a way of organizing society in the most democratic way possible. \n\nFirstly, an anarchist society would likely have an education system built to actually educate people on how to behave in a pro-social, cooperative manner and solve disputes amicably and without the use of violence. It might have media that promotes pro-social values and equality between the sexes. It would certainly have an economic system that ensured no one would need to steal to survive or afford the necessities of life. These factors would likely contribute to a society where things such as murder, rape, and theft would be far less prevalent. \n\nHowever, it would be foolish to assume that such crimes would disappear completely, or even be reduced substantially overnight, \"after the revolution\". If a community felt threatened by pervasive occurrences of anti-social behavior, they could vote to form a police force, if they felt it was necessary and would be beneficial to the community. \n\nSuch an organization would likely be overtly democratic in nature, with elected officers and total accountability to the people. Officers could be suspended or recalled for use of force that was questionably justified. A truly independent, third party oversight body could be established to monitor all activities, records, and locations under the authority of the organization. Total transparency of operations, total democratic accountability, and policies shaped directly by the citizens themselves would likely be the cornerstones of any such organization in an anarchist society. \n\nThe people themselves would shape the policy of such an organization, directly outlining the goals and methods of the officers. What they are authorized to do, in the name of the community, how and when to use force, etc. A similar approach would likely be taken when establishing any sort of criminal justice system. A concisely written set of rules for the community could be voted into effect and be enforced by elected officers. Different communities may deal with murderers and rapists in different ways. Some may choose to isolate them from the rest of society, to prevent them from causing further harm. Some may restrict them to their homes, some may mandate some form of behavioral or cognitive therapy, psychoanalysis and mental health treatment, or even medication. \n\nThe only thing that must be a constant is the democratic process. Anything that follows from that, the will of the people, would be consistent with anarchist values, assuming that whatever decisions they make followed the basic principle of respecting human dignity and whatever other inviolable principles such an anarchist society would have enshrined in their founding documents, if applicable.

{"author":"JumpJax","body":"I think the reading of the situation becomes too individualistic at a point though. The capitalist system may imbue the police force with a certain amount of power above what is normally given, but that power is not their own. The police are only a functionary of capitalism. The system has molded people as subjects with specialized roles with no alternative other than to obey. Those who don't obey end up in prison.\n\nSo I don't think there's an individualist responsibility or individualist solution to our society's problems. If any one of us had been born into different circumstances, we would have been different people. So, since we all contribute to that unjust society, we all must contribute to creating a better alternative and not look down our nose at people who would have lead different lives except for a quirk of fate.","created_utc":1524800783,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Four years after publication, Manufacturing Consent: The political Economy of the Mass Media was adapted to the cinema as Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media (1992), a documentary presentation of the propaganda-model of communication, the politics of the mass-communications business, and a biography of Chomsky.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1524828619,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"yanofero","body":"&gt;I don't have to lay out a comprehensive plan for tackling sexual assault in China to make that point.\n\nI was referring to your point that anything can be stored in blockchain, not sexual assault. What I'm getting at is that any avoidance of blockchain has no effect on anybody else's ability to store data in blockchain.\n\n&gt;Yeah, it is. It's a fad based on hype that people are quickly wising up to. Usage is already falling, and every additional scam, project failure and vaporware utopia is only likely to accelerate that.\n\nSo your main concern was the open ability to store data in blockchain, but you think blockchain's going away...? Then what are you worried about? Regardless, I think you might be missing an understanding of how blockchain works from a technical standpoint.\n\nThe data you're concerned with does not disappear because blockchain isn't popular enough. You would have to delete every single copy of whatever blockchain holds the data you want to erase. It's decentralized, meaning there are exact copies of them stored simultaneously all over the place. Even if you halted all mining\/processing and no new blocks were added, copies of the data would still be available.\n\n&gt;There's no practical reason to use them.\n\nI'll address this below.\n\n&gt;You can cryptographically sign things without a blockchain.\n\nYes, you can sign things without blockchain. What blockchain provides is a location for *storing* that signed data where it cannot be tampered with. Authorities can still tamper with or delete signed data-- It's just that the readers would *know* it was tampered with. Blockchain circumvents censorship, digital signatures do not. (Even if someone can't download a copy of the blockchain, the data can be extracted and sent in some other censorship-evading mechanism.)\n\nThe other advantage of blockchain is timestamped transactions. If I wanted to sign some of my data, putting a date in the contents is not enough. What's to stop me from just resigning the message later with a different date? If nobody had the original copy (to notice a changed signature), they would have no reason to believe the contents were as they were on the original date. If I wanted to achieve this without blockchain, I would have to depend on a trusted timestamping authority (a corporate 3rd-party).\n\nBoth are examples of practical applications of blockchain. Revolutionaries cannot depend on centralized authorities, especially in the sphere of the Internet.\n\n&gt;Even if you couldn't, there's the question of how you authenticate whoever signed it as a trusted (without landing them in a jail cell).\n\nThis is a problem regardless of blockchain. It's the classic question of how you know a keypair belongs to the person you think it does. It's not an unsolvable problem, but blindly trusting keys on the internet is dangerous.\n\n&gt;All authorities have to do is affect the signal-to-noise ratio - fill the blockchain with almost-identical posts and it becomes very difficult to tell which one is real.\n\nI'm not sure I understand the value of this attack. So is this assuming the data in question is not being authenticated with a signature (whether through the account that made the transaction or a signature tacked on)? If the attacker is just duplicating already published data, then just look at first version published.\n\n&gt;People could still share links to the correct one, of course, but if you already have a reliable way to send that information (email, texts, etc) why not simply send the whole post that way? \n\nI'm not proposing we put all of our comms into blockchain, that's ridiculous. It's more like there are niche circumstances in which it can be very valuable for revolutionaries to have a decentralized, tamper-proof mechanisms for storing data. Even if we don't want that, it's still going to be there anyways, might as well use it when it suits us.\n\n&gt;Soon there would be little reason to participate and a massive advantage to any similar network (blockchain or otherwise) which found a way to accomplish the same task without pissing off the government in question. \n\nI'm all for alternative forms of tech, but I think the concerns you raised stem from us living in a surveillance state in which networked infrastructre is controlled by the state. I don't see what makes blockchain any more threatening than similar approaches to the same end (storing tamper-proof data publicly).\n","created_utc":1524851027,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Sort it through ahead of time and try to sense how it will be. If their response is positive, you do not have to do much more than feel good and celebrate. (Though an initial positive response is often followed by a later shock wave of caution, question, and homophobic doubt. They have lived a long time in this society, too!) Another weight has been lifted from your back if the response is generally positive. If they respond negatively, hopefully you will find your own anger, hurt, sadness, and loneliness. These feelings were there all the time hiding behind the invisible catastrophic fantasy of how your parents might respond.\n\n&gt;You have not lost your parents at this moment of disclosure. You lost them long before. They did not love *you*, they loved a two-dimensional image of you that they and you invented together. Confronted with the real you, they admitted their unavailability as parents to the person you are by nature. All of your feelings are part of mourning the loss of your parents who were lost long before you confronted them with the truth. Loss is difficult. Pretending to have parents when they were lost long ago is an energy drain that ties you down and does not permit you to move along with the flow of life.

We've basically got the technological capacity to make things so cheaply that it is more efficient to pay at the point of production rather than consumption.  So we could have a society where there is a social expectation that people will put in a few hours or so a week to keep the the system running, and everyone gets all the things they want.  From each according to their mean, to each according to their needs.\n\nAnarchism.  To get to communism we're going to need to build a movement where the majority of people want it.  That means breaking down the structural barriers to co-operation.  Capital, patriarchy, nation, and every other unjustified form of oppression.\n\nSyndicalism.  Wage labour is the most common form of shared oppression people have.  Its also one of the points where we have the most power.  By withdrawing our labour we can bring down all or part of the system.  The workplace is one arena where we can have the little victories that allow a movement to grow to the point where we can have big victories.\n\nPlatformism.  There needs to be a specifically anarchist organisation to advocate for anarchism.  Especially if you are building mass organisations like labour syndicates.   There have been a number of cases where anarchist projects have been taken over by reformists and the anarchists expelled.

Meanwhile, our employers are all too happy to exploit this, and many well-established unions consider us largely \u201cunorganizable\u201d. Nevertheless, we\u2019ve shown that we\u2019re here and we\u2019re organized! Two years after going public, the Burgerville Workers Union has undergone incredible growth and transformation. We went on the biggest coordinated fast food strike in U.S. history this February and just won an election to make the store on 92nd and Powell the only legally recognized fast food union in the nation as well!\n&gt; \n&gt; This is all thanks to the hard work, skill, and ingenuity of Burgerville workers, but we also know that we could not have come this far without community support. Because the BVWU is not a dues paying organization and the IWW is almost entirely volunteer run, we are fundraising to create stipends to support dedicated organizers of color at the frontlines of our movement. We are looking to community supporters to help make this incredible organizing work sustainable and accessible for people of color, especially women and gender non-conforming folks, who face barriers related to discrimination and structural inequality on top of living paycheck to paycheck. People of color are subject to oppressive application of policy, harassment, and less opportunity for advancement in the workplace, and this is no less true at companies like Burgerville that boast progressive practices. There\u2019s nothing \u201clocal, sustainable and fresh\u2019\u2019 about poverty wages and racism.\n&gt; \n&gt; We, the workers of Burgerville believe all workers deserve wages and benefits that don\u2019t make covering rent and groceries mutually exclusive. From planning a delegation or a picket, to going on strike or entering contract bargaining, one thing is clear: workplace organizing takes energy, resources, and skill. In order to make a direct material difference in the accessibility of volunteer organizing, we need your support. The money we are fundraising will go directly towards leadership and skill development for workers of color organizing in the BVWU. It will help offset economic and material barriers to organizing that folks of color disproportionately face, and help us create access to this work where historically there hasn't been much.\n&gt; \n&gt; We at the BVWU believe the labor movement must also be a racial justice movement.

{"author":"DenverHoxha","body":"&gt;I was referring to your point that anything can be stored in blockchain, not sexual assault. What I'm getting at is that any avoidance of blockchain has no effect on anybody else's ability to store data in blockchain.\n\nYes, but the fact that this medium is very much a double-edged sword is relevant to the discussion. There's a reason places like 4chan aren't known for helping our cause(s) - unbridled free speech ain't always our friend.\n\n&gt;So your main concern was the open ability to store data in blockchain, but you think blockchain's going away...? Then what are you worried about? Regardless, I think you might be missing an understanding of how blockchain works from a technical standpoint.\n\nNo, my concern is that this is a shitty strategy for a hundred different reasons, including those two. \n\n&gt;The data you're concerned with does not disappear because blockchain isn't popular enough. You would have to delete every single copy of whatever blockchain holds the data you want to erase. It's decentralized, meaning there are exact copies of them stored simultaneously all over the place. Even if you halted all mining\/processing and no new blocks were added, copies of the data would still be available.\n\nYeah, but if all mining stopped we also wouldn't be able to store any more data on it. Furthermore, existing copies of the blockchain would become a lot less accessible really quickly - why host gigabytes of data if nobody's using it? \n\n&gt;Yes, you can sign things without blockchain. What blockchain provides is a location for storing that signed data where it cannot be tampered with. Authorities can still tamper with or delete signed data-- It's just that the readers would know it was tampered with. Blockchain circumvents censorship, digital signatures do not. (Even if someone can't download a copy of the blockchain, the data can be extracted and sent in some other censorship-evading mechanism.)\n\nYou can archive data in a whole bunch of places and verify it with cryptographic hash functions without a blockchain. \n\n&gt;I'm not sure I understand the value of this attack. So is this assuming the data in question is not being authenticated with a signature (whether through the account that made the transaction or a signature tacked on)? If the attacker is just duplicating already published data, then just look at first version published.\n\nWorks the first time, but with any kind of ongoing publication involving multiple users, flooding the network with similar content wouldn't be hard (this is already a massive problem with other online venues). How do you know an update from a new user (\"they're raiding the blockade\" etc) is real if it might not be the first of dozens that came out? \n\n&gt;I'm all for alternative forms of tech, but I think the concerns you raised stem from us living in a surveillance state in which networked infrastructre is controlled by the state. I don't see what makes blockchain any more threatening than similar approaches to the same end (storing tamper-proof data publicly).\n\nIf the blogger in question didn't live in a surveillance state that practices totalitarian control of the net, her post would have stayed up and this wouldn't be an issue. Regardless, I don't find blockchains \"threatening\", I just find them over-hyped, inefficient and generally a waste of time. ","created_utc":1524886271,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

If you need them to know you wrote it, you would be authenticated by the user you used for the transaction (or you could sign it if for whatever reason that's not sufficient).\n\nIf you can securely and reliably transmit the address on the blockchain, you can securely and reliably transmit the data itself.

That a deregulated (not *un*regulated) market can lead to immoral actions is not proof that it is not the most efficient mechanism possible.\n\nFurther, within the context of a mutualist society, there is no state to protect polluters and to force consumers to allow immoral actors to externalize their costs onto them.

You will look like a clueless idiot if you abstain from that for too long, especially if you are openly calling yourself an anarchist to other people. \n\nI can give a succinct explanation of the Conquest of Bread. First thing to know is that all our actions ripple around, nobody can claim sole ownerhip or even majority ownership for anything really. We are all weak and do nothing on our own. Property can be someone's to use, but to own? Who made it? Did everyone decide to help make that thing you own? How can you track this? How can we allocate a certain amount of credit to any individual in a denomination and regulate your participation in society by this credit, also called money? \n\nThe solution is to not charge anyone for services. We can ration things out in times of crisis, but this isn't an allocation based on how much you cause the commune to earn, but on how much there is to go around. All of society must be turned into democratic cooperatives and communes, simply giving any one part of society a free pass and it will be used as an obstacle to the whole process, often as part of a reactionary forces. \n\nA cooperative and commune can ensure that people do the work that needs to be done by simply having members either work reliably at the democratically determined quota of time (not units produced or money earned). So long as you do so, you will get all of society's benefits and if other resolutions fail, then expulsion from the commune and cooperative is required. This is how anarchist communism works in a nutshell and avoids the issue that many capitalist ideologies suggest that people will never work without monetary incentives.\n\nThat said, what you can do now is direct action, and the things you want to do like food not bombs are valuable even in their own right, not even just connected to anarchist philosophy and solutions. \n\nI know the same feeling of being a white male and wanting others to have the same rights as I do, to not get shot by the police for doing nothing at all, I want to be able to talk with a black man at the front of a bus, I want others to be able to live lives of peace when they are drafted into armies today. I get outraged at the Swedish government for reintroducing conscription, by definition an expression of the idea that a state owns you and your life.

But the certainty with which you dismiss something that it is pretty obvious you're not really familiar with, sounds more like trying to confirm your own bias. The idea that Marx's LTV is supposed to be an \"economic predictor\" that is useful for mainstream economics just underlines this. *It is not a theory of prices*, which is pretty much all mainstream economics care about today. It is an ideological, qualitative difference.\n\nAnd the reason the LTV is very hard to \"disprove\" is that as a consequence it is heavily reliant on the *abstract* definition of value (which is far from the same thing as price) which is very hard to confirm or deny with certainty empirically. It deals with underlying tendencies and counter-tendencies, and not primarily with surface phenomena like orthodox mainstream economics. Still, there is not an insignificant amount of people relying on a Marxian analysis to draw interesting and credible conclusions in the sphere of economics, like, say, Andrew Kliman.\n\nIf you actually want to look into the theory in earnest, you could look at an accessible youtube series like [this one](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dGT-hygPqUM&amp;list=PL3F695D99C91FC6F7).\n\nThe problem with some marxists is that they take Marx's findings as The Truth(tm), and not a conceptual set of tools among others that are not perfect but can be rather useful.

Yet it's really difficult to carve out a space where my tribe can be safe and happy and sustained (and the people I care about the most all struggle with mental illness and past abuse, and many of them are on welfare or broke) because the world will not let that happen. Also, I wish I saw more really fresh and modern takes on anarchism in the current age, because most of the stuff I see feels dated and stale (despite anarchism being timeless). The 20th century was about grand ideologies, and I want to see anarchism mutate into something that catches me completely off guard. Also, I think the most interesting stuff is not happening where I live in Canada, but the change I want to see is in my own community. So yeah, I'm stuck in a rut doing what I can for people that are important to me and to improve my community through my job, but I'm keenly aware it's not dealing with the root of what makes our society perverse.\n\nDon't let anything I'm saying stop you though.
