{"author":"hectorgrey123","body":"Those anarcho\\-capitalists who are definitely not alt\\-right are, in my honest opinion, misguided.  Capitalism is inherently hierarchical \\- it puts those who own the means of production over those who do not.  This is unavoidable \\- if you do not own the means to produce your own food, you have to serve those who do own the means to produce food in order to survive.\n\nThe current capitalist hierarchy gives 8 people access to more than half the world's wealth.  That doesn't mean that the richest 8 people have more wealth than half the world's population, just to clarify, it means that the richest 8 people have more wealth than everybody else on the planet combined.  If we remove the state, what makes you think that they couldn't and wouldn't just divide the world between themselves?  I mean, there would be a lot of unemployed soldiers with nothing to sell but their ability to kill people.\n\nHell, let us assume that as well as smashing the state, we also redistributed the wealth such that everybody on the planet has an equal share, and in some small corner of the globe they go with capitalism as a means of survival.  Capitalism means competition, and when people compete, somebody has to lose.  Eventually, in that one small area, you're going to have a minority own basically everything, while the majority must serve to survive.  Either that, or they must leave and find somewhere else to live where stuff isn't already owned by people, or they must take the stuff back by force.\n\nTo prevent either of these things from happening, those who own everything would have three options: use the threat of violence \\(which they would need the means to back up\\) to prevent revolt or desertion unless truly desperate, expand to make sure that while they have the lions share of everything, everybody else has just enough to keep them content, or ideally both.  The wealthy in this case become a de facto state, and the fact that they need to expand in order to prevent revolt will inevitably bring them into violent conflict with other groups of people, where they must either impose capitalism by force or risk revolt\/desertion from those already on the bottom of their current socio\\-economic hierarchy.\n\nThat is not to say that market\\-based economies inevitably end up like this.  You can have a market based economy where the workers share ownership of the means of production; this is not capitalism.  Ultimately, the state exists to protect capitalism \\- it does so by preventing the worst excesses in order to ensure that people do not become too desperate and by threatening the use of violence upon anybody who would threaten the interests of the ownership class.  Capitalism, deprived of the state, would simply create a new state out of necessity.","created_utc":1527860995,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Klupa","body":"Not OP but you basically have it right. Salafism was a reaction to the development of distinct schools of thought in Islamic jurisprudence as well as the general acceptance of certain philosophical and theological beliefs in later years. It prioritizes adherence to the Quran and Sunnah as interpreted by the earliest communities of believers (the *salaf*). It predates the movement of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, and is a broad enough term so you have sections within the movement that have traditionally been quietist, supported by the Kingdom, and focus on adherence to scripture on a social level, as well as Salafi-Jihadis, a more recent militant current that developed out of the experiences of various early insurgencies in Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Chechnya, and is inspired by figures like Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, Abu Qatada, and others.\n\nWahhabism is harder to define and I'm not a fan of the term because it is essentially derogatory and has become even more politicized than Salafi. You're absolutely right in that Wahhabism is obviously more closely tied to the beliefs and methodology of a single person and the movement he led in the 18th century, in alliance with the House of Saud. I guess when people use the term, they are referring to a variant of Salafism that developed in the Arabian peninsula as a reform movement and exists today as the official interpretation of Islamic teachings as understood by the Saudi state and clergy.\n\nMost Muslims indeed do not identify as Salafi and no one, to my knowledge, actually calls themselves a Wahhabi, but that doesn't mean large numbers of Muslims don't hold views we would call conservative. It would be a mistake to think Salafi equals fundamentalist, and that anyone who falls outside of this label is therefore \"moderate.\" The Taliban for instance, with all their repression and austere interpretation of Islamic law, are actually not related to the Salafi movement at all and come to their conclusions through following a completely separate tradition within Sunni Islam.","created_utc":1527865885,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"HaLoGuY007","body":"&gt; Ten men and women facing various felonies related to Inauguration Day protests against President Donald Trump had charges against them dismissed on Thursday, after unconstitutional and untoward behavior by the prosecution was discovered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Kerkhoff and her team appeared to have hid 69 recordings from the defense. Those recordings include 66 videos and three audio samples of the defendants originally made by employees at undercover media outlet Project Veritas.\n&gt; \n&gt; The recordings reportedly show the defendants discussing methods to de-escalate tense situations and reveal their intent not to initiate violence with anyone else at the protest, a far cry from what the government has alleged in the case. Kerkhoff previously told Judge Robert Morin that no recordings existed from the meetings where those 69 recordings were made. In fact, at least 35 of those newly-revealed recordings were made at the meetings in question.\n&gt; \n&gt; Defense attorney Andrew Clarke noted the alleged malfeasance in an overnight filing with the Washington D.C. Superior Court on Wednesday. He wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; *The Government has succeeded in misleading over 200 co-defendants, their attorneys, and three Honorable Superior Court Judges to believe there were only seven videos in its possession from Project Veritas. Only by Order of the Court and more recently, its own disclosures, we now know the truth, that the Government withheld 69 additional recordings by Project Veritas and altered others.*\n&gt; \n&gt; Clarke\u2019s motion continues, \u201cAs the government admitted in its May 30, 2018 email to the Court, many of these videos from the action camp at American University involved discussions of de-escalation tactics. So if [a police officer] did see co-defendants at the action camp, it is disturbing that the government is taking the position that videos showing co-defendants teaching other codefendants how not to engage in violent protest is irrelevant to a case about violent protests.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Such evidence, Clarke noted, is \u201crelevant, material, and exculpatory.\u201d While hiding said evidence and performing subterfuge in front of a federal court to conceal said evidence, Kerkhoff has spent the past several months arguing that the defendants played direct and key roles in an alleged conspiracy to riot.\n&gt; \n&gt; Judge Robert Morin agreed with the defense, saying, \u2018\u201cI do think it\u2019s a serious violation.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Kerkhoff originally indicted in excess of 200 journalists and activists on those and related charges. After losing outright in a case against the first six defendants last December, Kerkhoff dropped charges against all but 59 individuals. Some of those individuals are going free on Thursday or soon thereafter. As noted by First Amendment attorney Chip Gibbons and others, however, multiple defendants still remain in other cases nominally related to those anti-Trump protests. The impact Wednesday\u2019s disclosures will have on those cases is presently unclear.\n&gt; \n&gt; This isn\u2019t the first instance of prosecutorial misbehavior in the present case. Last week, Kerkhoff\u2019s team admitted to hiding a 55-minute-long video and purposely misrepresenting edits made to a different video. In sum, the 71 altered or hidden files suggest a wide-ranging conspiracy to conceal potentially exculpatory evidence in order to secure convictions. In federal law, that\u2019s known as a Brady violation.\n&gt; \n&gt; The other Assistant U.S. Attorneys who took part in the government\u2019s prosecution of the #J20 journalists and activists are AUSAs Ahmed Baset and Rizwan Qureshi. Law&amp;Crime repeatedly attempted to discuss Thursday\u2019s dismissals and the government\u2019s bad behavior leading to said dismissals. Neither Qureshi nor Kerkhoff responded to multiple voicemails.\n&gt; \n&gt; Baset answered his phone but declined to comment on the case, saying, \u201cI cannot take any media inquiries.\u201d When further pressed as to whether he personally took part in the apparent evidentiary cover-up, Baset replied, \u201cI cannot answer any questions.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; On Baset\u2019s request, Law&amp;Crime then followed up with the public affairs line for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia.

What is scary about denying any group of people the ability to demonstrate is that sooner or later it is you who is denied the ability to demonstrate openly. \n\nAs an anarchist yourself, you are certainly perceived by the majority of people as all the negative connotations associated with anarchism, albeit untrue; violent, chaos, destroyer of society, etc., and if everyone went around believing their own moral compass is absolute for all, anarchists would be one of the first groups of people oppressed and denied the right to free speech. \n\n\u201cFighting\u201d these people is possible with words, ideas, and living your truth. Unfortunately, even in so called anarchist groups, many individuals would rather attack you as a person for having a different perspective rather than try to teach you or possibly even learn something from you. \n\n\nWhen it comes to violence, by all means defend yourself with physical force. But when it comes to the right to peaceably demonstrate, why not treat them like you\u2019d want you and your fellow anarchists to be treated?

As long as there is still room to talk to people and enlighten them of the err of their ways then violence will only beget more violence, including against you and the people you are trying to protect. \n\nThis is my 2 cents and looking a little bit into human and animal psychology will show the need for an approach other than punching people who are \u201cother\u201d, even if they are dumb as fuck and weak minded.

{"author":"Sergeant_Static","body":"It obviously depends on the circumstances leading up to the punch, but I'm generally opposed to it for a few reasons:\n\nThe first reason is that perpetuates the popular mainstream narrative that the left is anti-free speech and is dangerously violent, and thus more police and harsher law enforcement methods are needed to keep these radical leftists under control. It plays into people's attempts to discredit leftist activists and movements, and convince \"average Americans\" to ignore such movements as being out of touch. Nazis become seen as peaceful protesters using their freedom of speech and leftists become seen as trouble makers threatening everyone's safety.\n\nThe second is that punching Nazis further entrenches them in their victim hood mindset of someone facing political persecution. They are in a sort of political, social and cultural bubble that's very difficult to get out of. Now, this isn't to say that engaging in civil debate with Nazis is likely to get you anywhere, in some cases it's an exercise of futility, but it's important to remember that they are all humans who found an appeal in an extreme, violent ideology for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is white men feeling like they're losing their privileged status in society. Nazis, and other groups like them, intentionally recruit people who feel lonely, helpless, frustrated or ignored and make them feel like they have a sense of community. I don't want to do anything that may drive them further into that community by making them feel like there's no escape from it.\n\nThat said, there's a very real threat to letting people openly organize in favor of ethnic cleansing and state sponsored terrorism against ethnic minorities considered incompatible with their ideal fascist state, and we can't pretend that the absence of an explicitly fascist party in the United States means we can't still have fascist government policy. Sometimes, in order to protect people who need protection, you gotta punch a Nazi or two.","created_utc":1527954347,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

After asking the protesters to leave several times, university police pepper sprayed a group of demonstrators as they were seated on a paved path in the campus quad. The video of UC Davis police officer Lt. John Pike pepper-spraying demonstrators spread around the world as a viral video and the photograph became an internet meme. Officer Alex Lee also pepper-sprayed demonstrators at Pike's direction.\n   \n&gt; John Pike was subsequently fired, despite a recommendation that he face disciplinary action but be kept on the job. As of August 2014, Alex Lee was no longer listed in a state salary-database as working at UC Davis.\n    \n&gt; In October 2013, a judge ruled that Lt. John Pike, the lead pepper sprayer, would be paid $38,000 in worker's compensation benefits, to compensate for his alleged psychological disability. Apart from the worker's compensation award, he retained his retirement credits. The three dozen student protestors, meanwhile, were collectively awarded US$1 million by UC Davis in a settlement from a federal lawsuit, with each pepper-sprayed student receiving $30,000 individually.\n   \nAfter the incident, large protests against the use of pepper spray occurred on campus.

These systems are not our bodies, but they can be fundamentally intertwined. For example, in my view, language and memory are technologies.

Things are technologies only in a phenomenological sense, when we interact with them as things-for-us. By themselves, they're not technologies. I also focus on mediation to emphasize the bounded nature of technology and to express that things are as they are because we, or someone, chose for it to be this way. By way of example, English is the most-dominant language not because it is inherently superior to other languages but because British and American imperialists imposed it on their subjects.\n\nThis definition also removes \"science\" as a requirement.

Pottery is one of the oldest human inventions, originating before the Neolithic period, with ceramic objects like the Gravettian culture Venus of Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice figurine discovered in the Czech Republic date back to 29,000\u201325,000 BC, and just to preempt any denial on your part that this constitutes \"culture\", I'd like to inform you that anthropologists use a respective people's form and style of pottery to classify and title their Cultures, e.g.  In Japan, from about 14,000 BCE, the \"Jomon\" culture was named after the decorative technique of leaving impressions on the outside of the pot, by pressing rope into the clay before firing it.\n\n**\\(3\\)**  \\(*I'm hesitant to even do this, as I don't want my informed and researched response to give your \"response\" any unearned legitimacy*\\), Homo Sapiens \\(Modern Humans\\) have had the same exact, identical physiological capacity and capability for intelligence for the last 200,000 years that we have presently.  \\(many anthropologists would argue even longer than that \\(e.g evidence strongly suggests that Homo Erectus used fire upwards of 1.7 million years ago\\).  \n\n**\\(4\\)** I guess you've taken a shortcut to thinking and contrary to informed understanding, have assumed that \"technology\" is exclusively synonymous with modern electronics.  This is wholly incorrect. The very first form of Human technology \\(and even older, Hominid technology\\) are stone Tools which were developed by our hominid predecessors long before homo sapiens emerged 200,000 years ago.  The oldest stone tools discovered so far are the Oldowan tools found in Gona, Ethiopia, and created by yet to be determined hominid ancestors approximately 2.6 million years ago.  To put it simply, technology has existed 13x longer than our species has.\n\n**\\(5\\)** Following this exercise, now I'm not sure if you even understand your own comment.  Regardless, I would like to point out that for approximately the first 140,000 years of our existence, our species didn't feel the need to create art, and that for 190,000 years of our existence, we didn't feel the need to create civilization, so it couldn't have been unfulfilling.  There's also the fact that indigenous hunter\\-gatherers, living identical to that of Paleolithic humans, **still** exist in the present, and they still have not chosen our civilized way of life in spite of it's flashy and shiny toys.  Perhaps most demonstrative is that in the history of the European expansion into the Americas beginning at the end of the 15th Century up until the American Government's genocide of Native peoples, there is not a single instance or example of an indigenous person** WILLINGL**Y \\(under their own volition\\) going over to the European \"side\" and adopting European culture and their lifeway, while on the other hand, there are, for all intents and purposes, enumerable examples of European settlers, explorers, etc willingly defecting and adopting the uncivilized lifeway of the indigenous peoples they encountered.

{"author":"Anarch0Primitiv","body":"Not exactly sure what you're final question is asking, and I can't speak to what others believe, but I can speak for myself.  Anarcho\\-Primitivism is predominatnly predicated on what can be considered the conclusions and consensus of mainstream, modern anthropology, namely the follow:\n\n1. Civilization cannot exist with agriculture because civilization is defined by division and specialization of labor, institutional hierarchy and authority.  Agriculture produces surplus, which means other people are freed from having to work for their own survival, and are therefore able to become Despotic rulers, Religious authorities, Police\/Soldiers, Slave Masters, and all the other \"progresses\" achieved by civilization.  Based on all the archeological and climatic evidence we have uncovered, Anthropologists support the hypothesis that agriculture, whether implemented with zero modern technology, or all of it like at present, is inherently environmentally unsustainable and that soil, with respective to its productive capacity, is a nonrenewable resource.  For example,  the soils of the Mediterranean basin were largely destroyed by 2,000 years ago, and they remain wrecked today. They are quite likely to remain wrecked for many, many thousands of years.  The soil of the once, Fertile Crescent was completely destroyed withing a thousand years of humans beginning agriculture and the area remains a desert to this day.  **So, based on the overwhelming evidence, and the complete absense of evidence demonstrating the contrary, we can conclude that agriculture is inherently unsustainable and therefore, civilization is as well.  Historically speaking, since the emergence of civilization, every single previous civilization, without exception, has collapsed and largely, if not predominantly due to environmental degradation.**\n2. **Wait for the Collapse or foment it?** I suppose this is what you're asking, whether there is an internal division among AnPrims on waiting for the collapse or bringing it about.

Furthermore, unlike all other forms of anarchism, AnPrim is the only one basing their vision of a free and meaningful existence on a real part of our species history, in fact 95&amp;#37; of our species history, and in that respect, it's much more realistic than any other form of anarchism which proposes something completely hypothetical and then, like religion, demands a certain degree of \"faith\" in its adherents.  It's based on have the spine to openly say that this modern world does not work for me or us as a species, that it's unfulfilling, and that I'm unhappy in it....and that does take a lot of spine because for some reason in our modern society, people are more willing to admit to being an addict than they are to being depressed or unfulfilled by this vapid existence, which is crazy.  And when someone does say such things, the majority of people respond to it as though they're personally offended for some reason.\n\nGoing to an unfulfilling, soul crushing job, regardless of whether the workers' self\\-managed it or not, sounds like the same depressing existence of modern capitalism, with the only difference being a change in management.  And, even if you are self\\-managing, you're still sacrificing your time, labor, and your very being on something other than your own direct survival, and that's why it's alienating.  Personally, I would never be unhappy knowing that all my labor goes directly to my own subsistence, and I'd be happy to accept the fear of wild animals, accidents, etc, which are worries that as a hunter\\-gatherer you can directly address and prevent, than the abstract, existential worries and crises of modern civilization, like an existence with no real purpose, absence of any real sense of community, having control over your life be in the hands of your boss, or landlord, or bank...if my choice is that or the tiger, I'll take the tiger everyday.  There's a reason why many indigenous, hunter\\-gatherer peoples still extant have no conceptual or linguistic differentiation between \"work\" and \"play\" \\(like the Papuan people\\), it's because what we would call \"work\" to them isn't alienating, unfulfilling and soul crushing.  There's a reason that the World Health Organization predicts that Depression will be the most diagnosed disease in the world by 2030, while instances of mental illness among indigenous Hunter\\-gatherers is exceedingly rare or non existent.  There's a reason why in all the history of European expansion into the Americas from 1492 to the present, there are enumerable examples of Europeans defecting to the indigenous lifeway and completely abandoning civilization, while there is literally not a single example of a Native\/indigenous person **willingly** adopting the civilized, european lifeway.","created_utc":1528102369,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

These fields include astrophysics, which has revealed how planets and stars form, interact, and die; particle physics, which has revealed how matter behaves at the smallest scales; evolutionary biology, which predicts how life will evolve over time; and plate tectonics, which shows how continents shift over millennia.\n\nAll projections of the future of the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe must account for the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must increase over time.

{"author":"QWieke","body":"I haven't read all that much transhumanism, I mostly encountered it tangentially through the courses I followed at university (I've studied artificial intelligence). \n\nOne of the things that did solidify my belief in transhumanism was [this lecture by Anders Sandsberg](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Etrl4Z-9tfc) (fun fact, I'm visible in the audience). He has a [website](http:\/\/www.aleph.se\/Trans\/) with a lot of interesting texts, I'd say the text on [Morphological Freedom](http:\/\/www.aleph.se\/Nada\/Texts\/MorphologicalFreedom.htm) is probably the most relevant one for Anarchists (haven't read everything yet). Granted he's not an anarchist and this shows in his works.\n\nNick Bostrom has a couple of interesting books. [Superintelligence](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies) is probably the most well known (it's the book that got all the techbro billionares worried about AI). [Global Catastrophic Risks](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Global_Catastrophic_Risks_(book\\)) which is also quite interesting (it even has a chapter on totalitarianism as an existential risk). Finally he also has a book on [Human Enhancement](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Human_Enhancement_(book)) which I own but haven't gotten around to reading yet.\n\nAnother interesting one might be the [Human Iterations](http:\/\/humaniterations.net\/) site of William Gillis (a anarcho-transhumanist). He has a lot of texts on a lot of topics and I haven't gotten around to reading it all, but the ones on transhumanism and the ones on science (especially [Science as Radicalism](http:\/\/humaniterations.net\/2015\/08\/18\/science-as-radicalism\/)) are all pretty good. He has a rather unapologetic anarchist tone that I rather like (eg [The Floating Metal Sphere Trump Card](http:\/\/humaniterations.net\/2011\/09\/21\/the-floating-metal-sphere-trump-card\/)).\n\n---\n\n&gt; Another side of the problem or at least matter is that actually transhumanism is personified by the silicon Valley. And as such it's deeply capitalist. It's not anti racist nor anti sexist. \n\nI kinda feel like there are roughly two camps in transhumanism. \n\nOne camp that focuses on the technology. They're basically a bunch of techno-optimist cheerleaders who mostly ignore the social aspects of the issues and assume it will all just be good for them individually. These are the ones I associate with Silicon Valley and all the tech-bro billionaires. \/r\/Futurology is full of them.\n\nThe other camp focuses on liberation. The ones that want to use technology to liberate us from our biological limitations and explore states of being that are better and more interesting than we can reach now (like Sandsberg and Gillis). Granted this group seems to be a lot smaller, or at least not as well represented in media (for obvious reasons), and seems to be limited to universities and political radicals.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: Heh, just noticed that Gillis is probably the creator of the r\/anarchotranshumanist\/ subreddit. (Assuming his reddit handle and twitter handle are the same.)\n\nEDIT2: Apparently Gillis recommends this text [Anarcho-Syndicalism, Technology and Ecology](http:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/graham-purchase-anarcho-syndicalism-technology-and-ecology), though [there are no good books on anarcho-transhumanism](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DebateAnarchism\/comments\/1z9l24\/anarchotranshumanism_ama\/cfs81fm\/).","created_utc":1528132791,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

The US federal government doesn't officially designate any organisation as domestic terrorists as the State, Defense, Justice and Treasury departments do with foreign groups and states, there simply isn't the legislation or mechanism to do so. (confirmed when a 300 thousand signature poll in the We the People site called the Obama to designate antifa as a terror group and the white house had to say that that process doesn't exist). I belive it relates to free speech laws. Upon designation as a terror group it can be illegal for a US citizen to support, promote, fund etc that group, however to apply these sorts of laws within the US could be considered unconstitutional, and at the very least difficult to get through Congress due to the propensity for Americans to get very excited about free speech. \n\nHowever, the US government clearly obviously does discuss domestic terrorism. The FBI particularly . In testimony, reports and briefing us government agencies will reference domestic terrorism and label or relate various ideologies, movements, groups etc to domestic terrorism. However, no domestic groups are designate terrorists and so for example there are no federal laws against supporting antifa as there may be if you were to be supporting al-qaeda.

We are forming connections with lots of groups which do the same. To a lesser degree we stay involved in other local political causes and are slowly getting the idea of supporting worker cooperatives to be a high priority issue for socialists, progressives, and even standard democrats.\n\nI personally see cooperatives as a seed institution around which a broader revolutionary front can grow.\n\nEdit: oh and i've done some black blocking but thats just for fun ;\\)\n\nEdit: one last thing, when I can I donate to important causes like the Anarchist legal defense fund and various economic projects in the communes of Rojava.

In existentialism, authenticity is the degree to which one is true to one's own personality, spirit, or character, despite external pressures; the conscious self is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces, pressures, and influences which are very different from, and other than, itself. A lack of authenticity is considered in existentialism to be bad faith. The call of authenticity resonates with the famous instruction by the Oracle of Delphi, \u201cKnow thyself.\u201d But authenticity extends this message: \"Don\u2019t merely know thyself \u2013 be thyself.\"\n\nViews of authenticity in cultural activities vary widely.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1528173680,"score":4,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

For search, as [u\/Funeoz](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Funeoz) noted, try DuckDuckGo instead of Google. Proton Mail and [tuto.io](https:\/\/tuto.io\/) are good options for mail. Use Linux instead of Windows if that's something you're comfortable with. Linux is extremely easy to install and use these days, and your computer will be more responsive. The best thing, obviously, is no digital communication, but that's not really possible for the day to day in 2018.\n\nIf you plan to use tor, you need to do some research or you may end up inadvertently making yourself more conspicuous. I'd recommend running [Tails OS](https:\/\/tails.boum.org\/) and reading up on exit relays.\n\nUsing any VPN is a leap of faith. If they want to, they can see and log *everything* you do. This has happened before and there's always a non\\-zero chance that they're keeping logs. Do a lot of research before you pull the trigger. If you're broke, Proton Mail came out with [ProtonVPN](https:\/\/protonvpn.com\/), which has a \\(seemingly legitimate\\) free tier that you can use to connect through the Netherlands. I'm using it right now. Again, research it first. That One Privacy Guy is a site that has [detailed comparisons](https:\/\/thatoneprivacysite.net\/vpn-comparison-chart\/) of every VPN.\n\nAnother thing to try is [pi\\-hole](https:\/\/pi-hole.net\/). It runs on a Raspberry Pi, serves DNS \\(domain name system\\) on your local network, and can block ads and telemetry \\([DietPi](https:\/\/dietpi.com\/phpbb\/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=5) is a great lightweight OS for Raspberry Pi\\). Mozilla has a good [article](https:\/\/hacks.mozilla.org\/2018\/05\/a-cartoon-intro-to-dns-over-https\/) that explains DNS in a really understandable way. DNS is the easiest and most likely \\(but not only\\) way that your ISP records your traffic, and it's now easier than ever to [encrypt](https:\/\/bendews.com\/posts\/implement-dns-over-https\/) using pi\\-hole with Cloudflare's DNS\\-Over\\-HTTPS service \\(it does collect anonymized data though\\).\n\nAs for your phone, I don't know all much about securing it. Other folks may know more. AFAIK the best course is a pre\\-paid flip phone. That's what I use. Moxie Marlinspike's Signal messaging app has a good balance of security to usability, with, as always, some caveats. Try to find apps with the most restrictive permissions. On Android, use the [F\\-Droid store](https:\/\/f-droid.org\/) whenever you can find an appropriate app. You can use a VPN but there will be things you can't hide, like call metadata and physical location.\n\nedit: a word","created_utc":1528205413,"score":24,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"HeloRising","body":"Maybe 10-12 years ago I had *massive* debt from a hospital visit (America healthcare #1!!1!!) that ammounted to about $50,000. I worried about it daily because I was making next to nothing at the time and just to keep the amount steady and not have it go up because of the interest I'd have to pay something like $200 a month. This was back when I was working with ~$20 *per month* for groceries.\n\nThere was no possible way I could pay it off or even just stay ahead of it and I felt absolutely despondent because I figured I'd fallen into a trap that I wouldn't get out of for the rest of my life.\n\nWhat turned that around was a phone call with the collection agency.\n\nI'll paraphrase as best I can, this was a long time ago.\n\nCA= Collection Agent\n\nMe= Well...me.\n\nCA - \"Hi there this is Alan Smithee calling on behalf of \"We Want Our Fucking Money, You Peasant\" Medical for HeloRising.\"\n\nMe - \"Yeah, I know. Look...I don't know what to do. I'm on food stamps, barely making rent, I went to the ER because I had a sinus infection I couldn't afford to get antibiotics for. There's no way I'll be able to pay this off.\"\n\nWe went back and forth for about five minutes, payment plans were suggested, etc. I asked what would happen if I failed to pay.\n\nCA - \"Well, sir, the interest would continue to accrue and you'd be hit with financial penalties for non-payment.\"\n\nMe - \"Yeah, I get that, but what would you actually *do?*\n\nCA - *silent for a second* \"Well...we would...continue to contact you and do what we legally could to assure collection on behalf of our client.\"\n\nMe - \"Ok...but what can you legally actually do to me?\"\n\nCA - \"We...can in fact take you to court for non-payment.\"\n\nMe - \"This is a civil matter so the only thing you could do is get a judgement against me to pay you more money. Since that obviously isn't going to work because I can't pay you money I physically don't have....\n\nBy now it's starting to dawn on me that their cards are pretty limited. They can bluff and yell at you all the want but it's starting to sink in that their actual ability to fuck with you is not as great as they say it is.\n\nCA - \"We could apply to the court to garnish your wages and it would negatively affect your credit score.\"\n\nMe - \"First off, garnish all you want the money isn't there and if you somehow manage to get a court to sign off on that, you're virtually guaranteeing that I'll end up losing my place and then my job, ensuring that, again, you get nothing. Second, my credit score is fucked anyways and that score only matters if I want to do something like buy a new car or a home, things I won't be able to do anyways because I have no money. So what ultimately I'm hearing is that literally everything you can legally do results in you not getting paid and in fact guarantees that.\"\n\nCA starts repeating their schpeal about credit scores and responsibility and on and on. By this point, the whole thing falls apart. There's nothing they can do. They can just keep adding to their spreadsheet and calling but...beyond just bugging the shit out of me, they're kinda hosed.\n\nAt this point I just start having fun with it. Whenever an agent calls and I have the time I keep them on the phone as long as humanly possible. Every minute they spend dealing with my shenanigans is another minute they aren't screaming at some working single mother.\n\nMost are pretty professional but I did have to remind one or two of them that I did in fact own firearms and if they wanted to press the issue in person that I would consider it a threat on my life and respond accordingly.\n\nThis went on for about five years. It did get kinda old after a while so I just blocked their numbers or hung up on them. I'd also just pass the phone to a friend and let them have fun with it. Our record was keeping one agent on the phone for three solid hours.\n\nAfter a while the actual amount I owed dropped. At the five year mark they were basically begging for $5,000. Debt collection agencies are a business and they'd rather make pennies on the dollar from you rather than get nothing at all. \n\nYeah my credit score was trashed and it took a few years to recover it but it was trashed at that point already so I didn't really lose anything.\n\n---\n\nSome notes before anybody thinks about trying this. I live in California which has some pretty strong debtor protection laws and pretty stiff penalties for debt collectors who break those rules. Things like my car and my property were protected so they couldn't be seized either by the agency or the courts. I also never made a payment. The second you make a payment, you're agreeing that you do owe whatever they say you do and now you're on the hook.\n\nResearch your local laws *hard* before you decide to flip debt collectors the bird because there are states where they can go after you a lot harder than in CA.\n\nGeneral tip when dealing with debtors: **Make sure the debt is legit.** Ask for written proof that you actually owe them a debt. A lot of places that buy debts (yes, this is a thing, welcome to Capitalism) don't actually acquire proof along with them so all they have is your name and what you owe on a spreadsheet which is not legal proof that you owe them anything.\n\nIf they can't come up with any proof, proof that you can see and touch, then you can tell them to pound sand. Debt collection agents will lie to you. Treat them like cops; say nothing more than you absolutely have to and always assume they're lying to get what they want. If they present a \"deal,\" get that in writing with someone's signature before you accept it.\n\nIf your state allows it, record *every* call they make with you. If your state requires notification then notify the agent and tell them talking with you is only possible if you are recording the call. They won't like it but you can remind them that if they're following the law they have nothing to worry about.\n\nThe key thing is to try and not let them get to you. Remind yourself there isn't much of anything they can actually do to you. They can't hurt you, they can't break into your home. They can take you to court but debt is a civil matter, not a criminal one and thus you cannot be jailed for debt to a private entity. If they start yelling at you or threatening you, hang up. \n\nWage garnishments are a thing but courts can and will overrule them if a garnishment seems too severe and you can remind the court and the agency that a garnishment would likely mean you losing your job and then nobody gets any money.","created_utc":1528225078,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"_shoohs_","body":"I'm a former ancap (10 years). \n\nI'll tell you the genuine truth of the matter. I was brainwashed. \n\nI was brainwashed by the Mises Institute, by the Cato Institute, and every other institute that is funded by multimillionaire corporate elites. I was deluded into believing that the most moral thing I could do to help mankind was to divide it, to tear it apart, to segregate, to stratify, to conquer others. And I believed it with every fabric of my soul. It's a world built on hate, it's a world powered by envy, by suspicion. A world where the the top of the social structure dictate to the bottom.\n\nI don't necessarily think they're bad or evil people. Usually, there are three kinds of ancap\/american libertarian. The first are normal people that are just grossly misinformed, mislead, manipulated into advocating and supporting a system that is stacked against them, that works against them. These ones are not too informed on the in's and out's of the philosophy, the economics, the literature, the history etc....they're usually just \"blow in's\"....here today - gone tomorrow kind of folks. The second group are just ordinary people that the current system just let slip through the net sadly. They felt isolated, ostracized from society, lonely, hurt etc. When you feel like this you start to look around for answers to your problems and it's these people in particular who are easy targets for the likes of the Mises\/Cato Institute which teaches them (and me for a time) that it wasn't the men and women that fought for their rights such as an eight hour workday, that it wasn't the protests and the riots and the endless negotiations and conflicts that won basic decent living standards....but rather it was those atop the social structure that felt we deserved an eight hour day. They start to blame the government, the poor, the helpless, minorities, foreigners, for their problems. As far as I was concerned, I knew it all and everyone else who dared to question the Mises Institute or it's corporate loving cronies just didn't understand economics. It's a cult. The last group of people were not ancaps originally per se but have swept into the movement because it offers them an opportunity to espouse their social conservatism and authoritarian tendencies through the *sanctity of private property rights*....in others words, these people are just waiting for an opportunity to dictate to a black man to \"get out of his community\" for the sheer sake of it. \n\nThe last time I visited their sub one of the top rated comments was along the lines of \"we can't have immigration....they're bringing feminism here\". It's astonishing to think equal rights for women is such a controversial issue over there. And if you think someone shouldn't have to declare bankruptcy having been diagnosed with cancer then you're literally Stalin. Literally. Stalin. .......Literally.

Capitalism as the system that invented propaganda does propaganda of itself very well. \n\n&gt; By the 1980 the economy inside the Kibbutzim started to rapidly deteriorate leading to the [Kibbutz crisis](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kibbutz_crisis),  where the debt levels of the Kibbutzim ran out of control, and they  struck a negotiation with their creditors to delete some of their debts,  but with conditions to restructure their economy as the current model  was unsustainable. \n\nIf they owned someone money they were part of the Capitalist System, and as such not a Anarchistic or Communistic Commune.

{"author":"va_str","body":"What you need to wrap your head around is the fundamental difference in distribution and what determines the value of goods under such an economic setup, and how people live together in a community. Bread only has a use when it's being eaten, for example. If no external value is assigned, one does not make bread if there isn't someone who needs to eat. The motivation for the production of bread then comes from people wanting to eat. To have enough food, a community will organise joint efforts to produce it. This has always been the case, and long before capitalist modes of production and value-form exchange were around. \n\nNow who determines whether someone is doing their part in this joint effort? The people they live with in the community, of course. And it's easy to proclaim that some people will be lazy and attempt to weasel their way out of it, but that simply isn't what we see in the anthropological record. The problem of discontent with contributing labour is tied to the disconnect between what you produce and how it is used (as in it's being stolen from you for mostly peanuts and used by people you've never heard of). There is a powerful evolutionary trait in humans that is thoroughly denied by this economic setup. As a silly little example, I used to live in an old factory building outside town with a bunch of other people, and some guy and myself made a big table for the communal eating space. That was the first time I made a contribution of my labour to a community, and the profound sense of satisfaction when people sat down to eat and have a laugh every day literally made me a communist. \n\nThe problem here is that at this point, society has all but lost this insight into how our very nature drives and rewards cooperation. If you see economics only through the lense of capitalism, these ideas seem utterly naive and utopian. But capitalism is thoroughly breaking us, and to regain any semblance of freedom, we need to reclaim our labour and the social value it could have.","created_utc":1528304331,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"content404","body":"Firstly, I agree with you that guns are not the problem and that the reasons people commit suicide are much more important.  That being said:\n\n&gt;People don't kill themselves at random, they have reasons. Reasons that don't go away just because the means are less convenient.  I guess I just think people have the right to end their own lives.\n\nThe problem with this is that a huge number of suicide attempts are impulsive, not decisions which are rationally thought out.  [This study](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/11924695?dopt=Abstract) found that 24% of people who attempted suicide made the decision less than 5 minutes before the attempt and [this study](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4965648\/) found that 48% of suicide attempts qualified as impulsive.  Guns make it much easier to act on suicidal impulses precisely because they can make for a quick and painless death.  We cannot dismiss the connection between suicides and guns.\n\nI think suicide rates would be drastically lower if we had a truly socialist society, much more so than if we just banned guns, but a healthy society is a long ways away.  Preventing people that have attempted suicide in the past from having access to guns would be a reasonable policy I think, but if we do not address the connection to suicides then the question we really have to ask is whether a higher suicide rate is a price worth paying for fewer restrictions on gun ownership.  That's not an easy question to answer but I do think there are ways we can reduce gun suicides without dangerously restricting gun ownership.\n\nMy only point here is that solely focusing on the roots of mental illnesses disregards actions we can take much sooner to reduce suicide rates.","created_utc":1528415643,"score":6,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Even at that time, the date was known to be wrong, there was evidence of indigenous presence in the Americas as far back as 50,000 years ago, and probably much longer, and entrance by many means across the Pacific and the Atlantic \u2014 perhaps, as Vine Deloria jr. put it, footsteps by indigenous Americans to other continents will one day be acknowledged.*\n\nThis isn't really true. Native-Americans from all over the Americas have recently been shown to originally be from around what is now Siberia as a mixture between [*Ancient North Eurasians* and something distantly related to modern East-Asians (probably around 40-60 respectively for most ethnic groups).](https:\/\/anthromadness.blogspot.com\/2017\/01\/human-genetic-diversity-discrete-or.html) See [here](http:\/\/www.sci-news.com\/othersciences\/anthropology\/article00463.html) too, I hate linking to news articles when it comes down to science but it gives people who are not too familiar with population genetics a rough gist. This mixture probably didn't occur any earlier than 30,000 years ago in Eurasia and most Native-Americans (especially south of Canada, as the prior article imparts) trace the entirety (or near entirety) of their ancestry to a bottle-neck that likely occurred when their ancestors crossed the Bering Strait sometime between 10,000-20,000 or so years ago. Any evidence of earlier Human habitation likely isn't evidence of peoples who survived to the present or even the Early Modern Era. \n\nThat being said, it doesn't take much away from the Professor's point. Even if you could frame the Natives as *immigrants;* they didn't remotely settle the Americas in a way that resembles the way Europeans did (or how West-Central Africans were brought there forcefully as slaves) so it is still very disingenuous to say *A Nation of Immigrants* as though the way everyone hit up the Americas was somehow *equal.*","created_utc":1528541660,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"sockhuman","body":"There are two major groups that are sometimes being called African Jews\\- the Oritawy, and the Plashmora. Both of them originate from Ethiopia, and therefore they are usually referred to in Israel as Ethiopians (although, a more accurate name would be Beita Israel). The main difference between them, is that the Plashmoras were forcibly converted to Christianity in the nineteenth century, and the Oritawy weren't. \n\nIsrael, is according to itself, a Jewish state, and the official line is that Judaism is a nationality. However, there is no consistent definition in law regarding who is considered a jew, partly because of the strong political power of Ultra\\-Orthodox Jews, who refuse to accept any non Orthodox as Jews, and require an overwhelming standard of evidence to accept the Judaism of someone, and they generally claim that Beita Israel haven't met this standard of evidence. (Tobe clear, not all Ultra\\-Orthodox Jews are like that, but those who aren't, are usually anti\\-Zionist, and refuse to vote, so they don't really count for political purposes)\n\nWe have a law in Israel, that is named \"The law of return, Which allows every Jewish person the world to relocate to Israel, and get an Israeli citizenship. In this particular law,a jew is defined as \"Someone who was born to a Jewish mother, or converted to Judaism; and is not a member of a different religion\". \n\nMost of the African Jews relocated to Israel, as a result of religious prosecution. However, today, the minister of the interior, who is an Ultra Orthodox, says, that the Plashmoras should not be considered as Jews according to this law, because they converted to Christianity, and therefore, the should be considered as \"Members of a different religion\". As such, the minister claims, they should be considered non\\-Jews according to this law, and therefore, they got citizenship based on a lie, which means their citizenship should be revoked, and they should be deported. The Plashmoras, however, Claim that they were converted forcibly, and thus, it doesn't really counts as a conversion, and therefore, they are to be considered as Jews according to this law. That means, that we have something similar to ICE in Israel now.\n\nMost people i know, side with the Plashmoras on that issue, but there isn't anything they can do, No one can have a government in Israel without the support of the Ultra\\-Orthodox parties in Israel.\n\nI believe, that it doesn't really matters whether or not they are Jewish, It's not Okay to deport people.

{"author":"sockhuman","body":"About half of the Jewish population in Israel are Sephardi. You probably don't know about them, because unlike Ashkenazim Jews, which a majority of them are American, there are not that many Sephardi Jews outside of Israel (most of the non Israeli Sephardi Jews live in France today). \nHere is an oversimplification of the issue-\nUntil the late seventies, There was only one ruling party in Israel- Mapai. They were Socdems, and heavily supported the Kibbutzim and Co-operatives (which were called- the working settlement).\nBefore The establishment of Israel, the Vast majority of Sephardi Jews lived in Muslim countries. However, as the Zionist movement grew, and eventually established a state (which claimed to represent all Jews), People across the Islamic world have began to associate Jewish people with Israel and Zionism, and therefore, a lot of Jews suffered from violence and discrimination. Those who could, moved to France, but the majority, had no choice, but to move to Israel, most of the times, they were unable to bring their money with them, and therefore they became poor. However, Israel was back then, predominantly Ashkenazi, and the Ashkenazi Establishment, with Mapai in its head, looked at them as second class citizens (Higher in the hierarchy then Arabs, but worse then Ashkenazim). They couldn't be accepted to a Kibbutz or a co-operative, and that's where the establishment gave the money. The government didn't even helped them find jobs (unlike the Ashkenazim). Furthermore, the government tried to erase their identity, and make a part of a unified Jewish culture (which was essentially Ashkenazi culture).\nIn the sixties, some of them got inspired By the Black panthers movement of the US, and made a movement with the same name in Israel, in order to fight for their rights (Sephardi Jews usually have darker skin the Ashkenazi Jews, and back then, there were almost no African Jews in Israel yet, so they were the blackest people here). This ultimately failed, and just made them more resentful about Mapai (totally justified). The establishment's reaction is best captured by this quote, from then Prime Minister Golda Me'ir \"They [the black panthers] aren't nice\".\nLater, in the seventies, the Veterans of the Black Panthers changed strategy, they ran to the Knesset (the Israeli Parliament) as their own party. However, they did not get any sits, because The right wing Likkud, which was  headed by former head of the fascist Etsel militia, from the British rule era, that he will work for their interests. with the Sephardi support, he won the 1977 election (after personally losing every elections since 1948, and still remaining the head of his party), and became prime minister. As prime minister he did not improve their situation, but instead, made the situation worse for the palestinians, and showed the Sephardi Jews that they are not in the bottom of the Hierarchy. and it worked. since then, the Likkud party lost only three elections. Meanwhile, the veterans of the black panthers movement have begun to run to the knnesset together with Makki (The communist party of israel, a mostly arab, although it contains jews, Leninist party. Even though they are Leninist, they are not such bad), and for some times, one of them was a member of the Knesset.\nToday, our current Prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, of the Likkud party, keeps using those racial tensions to remain in power since 2009, (He was also prime minister in 1996-1999), And he still doesn't do anything for the Sephardi Jews, apart then putting a Sephardi minister of culture, which made radio stations put more Sephardi music (she also took the governmental support from anyone who is against the policies of the government, so don't hold to much from her, she is a fascist, and she is incredibly racist against Arabs and Refugees). Sephardi Jews are still poorer then Ashkenazi Jews, and are still suffering from discrimination.\nThere obviously needs to be a change in this area, but the Likkud doesn't provide it, and instead, they just use the Sephardi Jews, and make life harder for Arabs.","created_utc":1528562132,"score":10,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Given that free societies tend to have community service or exile as their only two punishments, I'm pretty sure my logic is empirically vindicated.\n\nGiven that a large chunk of murders are essentially crimes of passion (i.e. bar fights gone wrong, ect) we can generally assume that they weren't going to be repeated *anyways*, but you've still gotta disincentivize it and prevent bloodfeuds (which is what seems to happen in societies where murder has *no* formal punishment).

{"author":"comix_corp","body":"It's not clear cut that the US completely lost the war in Vietnam. They fully achieved some of their main goals: destabilising the entire region, obliterating the economy of both the south and the north, and basically destroying Vietnamese society.\n\nChomsky explains this well:\n\n&gt; In Vietnam, the US had no particular interest in maintaining control over Vietnam, quite unlike Iraq.\nThe goal in Vietnam, the basic war aim in Vietnam was to destroy the country and for good rational reasons which they explained in places like Harvard and MIT. \n\n&gt; The problem was that they were concerned that an independent Vietnam might undertake a course of development that would become a kind of a model that others in the region would want to follow. It\u2019s what\u2019s called in internal documents a \u201cvirus\u201d that might infect others. And if we have virus that might infect others, we have to destroy the virus and inoculate the others. And that was what was done, the virus was destroyed, never going to be a model to anybody and the potential victims were inoculated like in Indonesia with staggering mass slaughter that was a \u201cgleam of light in Asia\u201d and the same in surrounding countries: Marcos in Philippines and so on. \n\n&gt; And the concern about spreading infection was very deep. So, George Kennan, for example, was afraid that, he was one of the top planners, that infection in Indonesia [Communist Party of Indonesia] might spread throughout all of south Asia even threatening the US position in the Middle East, a crucial area where the world\u2019s energy is. \n\n&gt; And it was feared that Vietnamese virus might extend as far as Indonesia. And if that happened, Japan\u2014John Dower here described Japan as the super domino\u2014Japan might have to accommodate to the Asian mainland, becoming its industrial and technological center in an independent area; that would, in effect, recreate what Japan was trying to achieve during the World War Two. They called it \u201cco-prosperity sphere,\u201d which would mean that the US would have lost the Second World War. And the United States, the government was not prepared in the late 1940s to lose the Second World War. \n\n&gt; And Vietnam, as John F. Kennedy put it, was \u201cthe keystone to the arch.\u201d I mean if that one fell, as it was called, that is move towards independence, the rot would spread and the virus would infect others and you\u2019d get\u2014it could turn out to be terrible. \n\n&gt; Kennan incidentally had no objection to restoring to Japan what he called it \u201cEmpire towards the South.\u201d It\u2019s co-prosperity sphere and the United States in fact did that. But this time, it was under US control, so it was OK. That\u2019s why Kennan supported reconstructing the Japanese world order but, of course, under US control.\n\n&gt; And Vietnam was regarded as \u201cthe keystone to the arch\u201d for that. You know, by 1968, it was pretty clear to anyone with eyes open that Vietnam would be lucky to survive; it wasn\u2019t going to be a model for anyone. The virus was destroyed, the region had been inoculated so the world became, as McGeorge Bundy later said\u2015former Harvard dean, he was national security advisor for Kennedy\u2014he said after 1965, with staggering mass slaughter in Indonesia, he said the US war in Indochina became \u201cexcessive.\u201d In other words, it was costing us too much. So it was kind of like a bad tactical decision to keep going after basic war aims had been won. \n\n&gt; That\u2019s the core of the issue. I think that\u2019s why business had turned against the war by 1968 and a year or two later at the extreme dissident left of intellectual opinion, you are allowed to call the war \u201ca mistake\u201d that began with \u201cblundering efforts to do good\".","created_utc":1528630735,"score":9,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"dumsaint","body":"All your points are the reasons why I refrain from listening to him nowadays. I first heard of him around the same time that bill became something for him to pounce upon.\n\nI didn't care for that path but his talks on the Jungian archetypal plane was fascinating. \"I'm spiritual, but not religious,\" (I died a little inside) and so his talks, somewhat McKenna-esque, on the psyche was interesting. McKenna also spoke of these archetypes so Peterson's videos were recommended. McKenna brought me to him but his popularity was rising in the same time frame. And I like Peterson when he discusses things akin to what McKenna would discuss. It's playful stuff.\n\nNow, I studied religion and philosophy in university so it was up my alley. I'm also a meditator so consciousness and its consequence and meaning fascinated me. Mind you, I watched some clips here and there but I was never pulled in by his density as some seem to be today, and this was prior to all this hoopla about and for him. If there had been hoopla when I began listening to him I didn't register it cause I can be dumb.\n\nSo it was an unfortunate thing when his hitherto unknown religiosity became too much for me to take him seriously; itself quite an aside from his political\/sociological leanings which I never thought to receive as something profound. Watch [this](https:\/\/youtu.be\/FmH7JUeVQb8) debate he had with Matt Dillahunty and you'll see how he can sound reasonable up to a point- in regards to supraluminal ideas- until he washes it all out in religious apologetic nonsense.\n\nAs a bonus, Matt slowly chips away at his mechanism of appeal throughout the debate.  It's slow to come but it happens and it's a well needed gut punch to Peterson's lofty sense of his own peerless righteousness. In particular, his moral kung-fu that an atheist would inherently be immoral, and thus an atheist can't exist cause Matt was moral. This begins at 1:32:30 in response to Peterson's answer of an audience question at 1:27:50. I was gobsmacked. Jebus! The man can speak, and speak without saying much. And if he says something I'd dare say his maze-speak is wondrously cultist.\n\nThe thing is, I'm fairly old enough to appreciate when my OS is being infected by a slowly downloading virus masquerading as a Jeri Ryan photo (4 Kb\/s!) but his younger, angrier and less critical audience won't. The issue becomes the more you find out who he is as he speaks, and his words become less tangled in personal subjectivity, the more of a left\/right dynamic his positions become, and the more he pools himself in a bucket of anachronistic ideals you've elucidated beautifully.\n\nIt's odd. I wished him well on his journey of personal transformation a l\u00e0 McKenna or Watts or other western intellectual *tryers* of the path but he eventually subsumed everything I liked about him under the arch of everything the path of the *tryer* negates.","created_utc":1528633551,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

But ask any lower class person and most will say that pride represents LGBTQ issues. Like it or not, that's the perception held by most of society. Pride can show LGBTQ folks that they aren't alone, and show people who wish to harm them that their opinons are not the norm. Like I said, I can stomach a little elitism if it means some people get to wake up the next morning instead of being killed or driven to suicide. \"Obstructing the normalization of marginalized people to own the libs\" is not good praxis.\n\nFrom the perspective of the anarchist movement, many people (edit: non anarchist people that is) would interpret being anti-pride as being anti-LGBTQ. Anarchism benefits from winning people over and that kind of thing isn't a good look for us. Think about the anarchist position on the US gun debate. It's not that we're \"pro gun rights,\" this just makes people believe that we agree with the right wing nutjobs anyway. It's not like we all want to grab AR-15's and go head to head against the National Guard. It's more that anarchists oppose the government holding a monopoly on violence. Same thing with pride, I don't think it makes sense to be anti-pride because the average Joe perceives this as though we are anti-LGBTQ, we should state that we oppose something more specific like \"fake pride\" or \"the corporatization of LGBTQ issues\" or something like that, ya know what I mean?\n\nI wanna emphasize that ultimately I agree with you and I can empathize with your feelings about the situation.

The official exchange rate is something like 80,000:1 but on sites like dolartoday you can see rates up to 2,000,000 to 1.\n\nSo I asked one of the contestants to take $10 of bananos and convert it to bolivars.

Bananos are tanking too vs the dollar so it\u2019s interesting to see if her salary has not buying power or less.\n\nSo, to address the video:\n\n- If $1 of crypto pays a weeks wages, everyone in Venezuela is poor. Upper class or no. Doesn\u2019t matter who supports the govt rich or poor, they are all poor by us standards.\n\n- some foods are unavailable, meats mainly. Some are fine.

{"author":"DenverHoxha","body":"Ok lets see...\n\n~2:00 - Standard Chavista claim that those \"sectors\" opposed to Maduro are all middle\/upper-middle class, backing it up with the location of protests. Problem is, protests have broken out in the poorer parts of Caracas and elsewhere in recent years, which is one of the big reasons people have suggested the current crisis goes beyond the status quo of reactionary opposition to Chavez. Also, it totally avoids any actual discussion of whether or not hunger is actually a growing problem in Venezuela today.\n\n~8:00 They drop a lot of impressive statistics here, but avoid the obvious context of an exploding global price for oil. \n\n~9:30 \"The vast majority of Venezuelans love and revere Chavez\". Umm...wew lad. Source please? \n\n~11:00 Talks about all the corporate sponsors of Transparency International, ignores TI's American branch getting its accreditation stripped by the global org for taking donations from those same corporations. Also conveniently ignores the question of whether corruption is a problem in Maduro's regime (spoiler: it really is).\n\n~12:00 Claiming that diversifying Venezuela's economy away from oil has been an explicit Chavista goal since the beginning - technically true, but in the end only makes the failure to do so that much worse. \n\n~13:30 - \"Social investment has gone up while revenue went down\". Uhh...yeah. That's exactly the point all their critics are making. \n\n~15:00 \"70% of the country's inflation is due to the rate of exchange with the US dollar\". This is either blatantly dishonest or these people have no idea how economics works. Exchange rates are not set by \"superpowers\", they're managed by markets and the reality is that there's very little demand for Venezuelan currency. \n\n~15:30 - This totally ignores the role of government policy, which has been a disaster. They set a program to distribute US dollars from oil sales so that local businesses could buy goods and resources from abroad without anywhere near the kind of safeguards needed to avoid abuse, and businesses took advantage of the ability to get piles of free money. Instead of fixing the problem, the government then opted to re-name the department and shuffle the same board-members multiple times in a row. \n\n~16:30 Ranting about the evil corporate monopolies that run the economy. These guys are awful, I'm sure, but if the reason your \"socialist\" system doesn't work comes down to the capitalists in control of your economy, then, well...\n\nI could go on, but I've already wasted an hour of my night and I don't expect a lot else. This is all exactly what you'd expect from a show expressly set up by the propaganda arm of the Venezuelan government. The central complaint seems to be that Oliver is framing the issue in a one-sided way, but the video itself is so cartoonishly one-sided that it's obvious their actual problem is that Oliver didn't pick their side. Definitely not what I'd call a reliable source.\n\nVenezuela is really complicated, but as a general rule you can usually write off perspectives that chalk it all up to the failures of socialism or nefarious American plots. What began as an inspiring revolt against American power in the region has turned into a comprehensive list of what not to do when trying to build socialism, and ignoring these problems isn't going to get us anywhere. \n\nFor further reading, I recommend [this thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/comments\/6rdxcu\/what_is_ranarchisms_opinion_on_venezuela\/) from last summer that turned into an impromptu AMA with a Venezuelan comrade.

Basically, anyone accepted can join for free and live here. Any big decisions will be decided as a group.\n\nI found this 3500m2 land, it's on a slight slope. It's literally in the middle of nowhere in the region of Auvergne in France. The view is amazing, surrounded by forest, and there is a rather crappy (for now) shelter that will be just fine during summer time to house a few people.\n\nAn association will be created, therefore the land won't belong directly to me but to a recognized organisation. Every decisions regarding our actions and what the land will be used for will be decided by the people living on it.\n\nMy personal goal with it would be to self\\-build a big house so we can get up to 10 people living there full time. I think we should also aim for self reliability, growing our own food, I'd also like the community to be 100&amp;#37; vegan as it make sense politicaly to be that way as anarchists (in my opinion).\n\nWe should also engage politicaly with our surroundings, one way or another, I'd personnaly love to create some kind of animal refuge or something like that. But again, this is open to discussion.\n\nIf you are interested feel free to PM me or just comment here. Also feel free to use this post to share your thoughts over this project or similar ones.\n\nThe land will be ready to accept new arrivals end of August 2018.\n\nEdit:  Forgot to add that to the post but I don't want people to feel like they are commiting for a lifetime, if you just want to spend a few weeks with us and decide to move on it's perfectly fine.\n\nEdit2: Truly amazed by the massive response from this sub, I seriously wasn't expecting such a high number of people wanting to join a project like this where everything has to be done. I've tried to answer to most people when I could, but you can be sure I'll go through this post and all the PM i've received to keep everyone that expressed some interest to join us updated on the situation.

{"author":"quatervois","body":"Milk requires forcibly impregnating cows and taking away their calves to take the milk the calves would have used themselves. The calves either become veal or grow up to become dairy cows. Once cows are no longer able to get pregnant (usually when they are around age 5, natural cow lifespan is 20 years), they are slaughtered for meat because they can no longer produce milk.\n\nLayer hens produce at least one egg every day - their wild counterparts tend to produce 12-20 eggs a *year.* As a result, their bodies lose a ton of calcium they're not exactly designed to lose, resulting in extremely brittle bones and other health issues. Chickens will often eat the eggs they've layed if they don't hatch, shell and all, to regain this calcium - obviously this isn't an option if humans are taking their eggs away.\n\nWhatever way you look at it, breeding these animals and benefitting from their bodies and their suffering is absolutely continuing hierarchies. Cows wouldn't give their milk to humans if given a choice between humans and their calves and chickens wouldn't choose to have broken legs so we can eat their eggs.","created_utc":1528725883,"score":14,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Ahhuatl","body":"That is in a nutshell why I found this piece to be totally uninspired.  The researcher in question cannot see beyond his society's own doxa and just runs with the notion that Americans are individualists because they surficially talk about social issues in personal terms.  That method of interpreting the world is not inherently indicative of an individualist mindset - quite the contrary, I think it is to be expected when you're dealing with people who frequently lack a higher education and thus lack the conceptual framework to deal with complex social issues in non-personal terms.  \n\nThe overwhelming conclusion I got from this piece is that his subjects were clearly *not* individualists.  Each individual was willing to accept their suffering as a necessary, albeit unfortunate, outcome of a system that is necessary for the continued success of the whole.  The fact that they find strength in the \"greatness\" of their country despite their low socio-economic standing couldn't more clearly demonstrate their priorities.  A person whose sense of worth is tied solely to personal accomplishments doesn't find solace in the success of others.\n\nHell, even the author's attempt to subtly check the privilege of the interviewer here:\n\n*\"What is a puzzle for you and me is actually not a puzzle for them at all. It is, in fact, the opposite. It is precisely because so many things have gone wrong for them that they get so much mileage out of being an American, which still happens to be a very prestigious national identity. One could argue that in a way it gives them a sense of identity like nothing else. They\u2019re hanging on to it precisely because they have nothing else to hang on to.  Saying they are possessed by false consciousness is actually a condescending take.\"*\n\nFalls flat.  \n\nThe reason why the patriotism of the American poor is so **puzzling** to liberal intellectuals is because the liberal view of the matter is built on a condescending false premise: \"American propaganda is filled with individualist non-sense and the poor are too stupid to do anything other than parrot propaganda, therefore the poor must be individualists too.\"\n\nSo unfathomable is the notion that they are wrong about the poor to the liberal intellectual that it never occurs to either the interviewer or the researcher that this situation is only puzzling to them because of their own preconceptions about the poor.  The moment one sets aside their prejudices about the poor and looks objectively at their behavior, this supposed puzzle disappears and their patriotism is rendered perfectly comprehensible.  If I could write the researcher, I would say nothing more than \"They behave as collectivists because your individualist hypothesis is wrong, dumb ass.\"  \n\nCollectivism provides stability in times of crisis, support in times of hardship.  It provides meaning, comfort, purpose, and a sense of belonging in ways that the material never can.  The fact that the poor place so much emphasis on the collective is not because \"they have nothing else\" but rather because in their own lives the collective has been proven time and time again to be a reliable means of surviving that must be defended.  The fact that the researcher can only envision a collectivist inclination as an act of desperation and hopelessness speaks to their own privilege and how to hopeless backward the American Left has it.   It is easier for them to conclude that these people are just entirely deluded, that in fact everyone everywhere is is deluded (see that Denmark nonsense) than to admit their premise is wrong and that is why it can't explain the behavior of huge swaths of the population.\n\n*sigh* That is what you get when you send a Sociologist to do an Anthropologists job.","created_utc":1528756861,"score":9,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I'm not sure what you know about it's origins, but it's a pretty horrific tale from the beginning to what is hoped to be nearing the end.\n\nBasically, Syria was under an extremely authoritarian regime and had been for decades under Bashar Assad and his father Hafez, who controlled the equivalent of the Syrian FBI called the Mukhabarat. Anyhow, effected by the Arab Spring movement, in 2011 some political dissent started to flare up. In one case, several young boys were arrested for writing graffiti condemning Assad. The regime tortured the young boys. This triggered large protests in Damascus and Derraa, which soon spread to other cities. Assad's response was to open fire on protestors in several cases. A 13 year old boy was tortured and killed. This only fanned the flames.\n\nBy late 2011 many were openly calling for the end of Assad's regime. Many groups were taking up arms to achieve this aim, which was aided by several Syrian soldiers defecting to form the Free Syrian Army (FSA). Meanwhile, jihadist groups were forming as well to overthrow Assad, and many of them were being armed by countries such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United States.\n\n*This is the part anarchists should take note of:*\n\nDuring this time time, many activists continued to work to establish Local Coordinating Committees (LCC) in liberated cities and neighborhoods. The idea was to provide a decentralized political leadership, and to work with brigades to defend against the regime. Activists should as Razan Zaitouneh and anarchist Omar Aziz worked bravely to coordinate the committees as well as to document attrocities by the regime and by rebel groups.\n\nBy 2014, Omar Aziz was dead and Razan Zaitouneh as well as four other activists known as the Douma Four were kidnapped and never heard from again. It is suspected that they were taken by the jihadist group Jaish al Islam because they (especially Razan) were reporting on atrocities by both the regime and by Jaish. The stories of Omar Aziz and Razan and the other Douma 4 are incredible and heartbreaking, and I highly recommend reading about them.\n\nBy this point the revolution was effectively dead (ignoring the Rojava Revolution in Northern Syria). And here I'd like to finally get to my point: **in a chaotic and violent situation such as revolution, the violent will always win.** This is exactly what happened when the externally-funded jihadist groups took over the rebellion, and Assad eventually took them over with international backing from Russia and Iran.\n\nThe lesson is that revolutions are dangerous. In the case of Syria, it was a complete lose for those activists involved, and for Syria it has resulted in half a million dead (before they stopped counting) and over 10 million displaced.\n\nOne should seek to avoid a violent revolution at all costs.","created_utc":1528789390,"score":5,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

You probably rushed into it and didn't think things through. I know \"This is an experiment\" and \"We learn from mistakes\" but there's also \"Rien ne sert de courir ; il faut partir \u00e0 point.\"\n\n* Your land isn't appropriate for a complete permaculture project, it's too small, even if it was just 1 person living on it, forget about getting autonomy for 10. At best you could use the forest surrounding your land, but I'm not sure that'll help as much as having one on your own land.\n\n* How much vegan are you planning to be ? There's rational veganism and radical veganism. If you want to do permaculture, animals will most likely be necessary, vegan or not. Let's take chicken as an example, they're not just meat and eggs, they have feathers, they shit everywhere, they're warm, they eat, they scratch the soil, all of these are helpful in permaculture. You can use the feathers for your bed, you can use their warmth by putting their shelter in a greenhouse to help prevent crops freezing, poop is the best fertilizer, they can protect fruit trees from bad insects by eating them and you might even consider eating eggs instead of throwing them away, when you'll be starving. All of that without killing any of them and without eating them (unless your plans have gone very wrong and you're starving a lot).\n\n* The only projects you've been talking about are an animal shelter and a dope underground house. Let's talk about that animal shelter. I've already mentioned how hard (or impossible) being autonomous on that land you own with 10 mouths to feed would be, and you're planning to add even more mouths there ? If you don't consider carefully how each animal you take in could help you, instead of taking in all the misery of the world and letting them do whatever they please with your land and food, full-autonomy will go from impossible to impossibler. You own a 3500m2 slope, not a country.\n\nAnyway with all that said, good luck and I hope for you (and the rest of the world I guess) that you'll prove me wrong.\n\nEdit: According to some research from a friend, you'd need between 1000 and 1500m2 of culture per person on your land.\nNot 1000m2 of land, 1000m2 of culture.","created_utc":1528792527,"score":12,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

The real battle against fascism, as with capitalism in general, is ideological and we have got to act conscious of that fact if we want to win it. \n\nThe Nazis of Golden Dawn didn't win substantial support by a campaign of punching anarchists-- they organized food handouts during a Great Depression. Of course, they made it despicable by making it \"Greek nationals only,\" but that wasn't the important part to the hungry people receiving food. If we aren't the ones providing these kinds of services then they will be. And on the flip-side, when Golden Dawn murdered antifascist Greek rapper Killah P, there was public outrage-- even the Greek media, who had given them a spotlight, started demonizing them as what they are-- a Nazi party. \n\nBut then, lo and behold, a while later some masked left-wingers shot and killed two Golden Dawn members, and a significant part of the public became sympathetic to them. They became martyrs and the left was painted as just as extreme and thuggish. \n\nGreece is just the example on my mind, because I just watched an excellent documentary following the rise of Golden Dawn (Golden Dawn: A Personal Affair, which you can stream for free on its website), but this is a universal reality. It's inconsequential whether you or I think there's a moral difference between violence against fascists and violence against antifascists. What matters in the big picture is the consequences that these actions have for the social forces the actors represent in the eyes of the public. I encourage all anarchists to consider that before they decide to punch out some alt right idiot.

{"author":"cmagnificent","body":"Okay, so let's break this down piece by piece.\n\n&gt;What the goal for a society is order...\n\nSo first, without defining what you mean by \"order\", directly in the context of social organization and human behavior, this statement is almost meaningless.\n\nSecondly, I would generally disagree with the idea that the goal of society is order, partly because \"society\" doesn't really have goals in the same way that individual people have goals. \"Society\" is just kind of an empty way of saying \"a group of people\" and unless that specific group of people chose to organize with each other with a specific end in mind, talking about a \"goal\" for the general case of \"society\" as an abstract concept, doesn't make any sense.\n\nMoving on from there, you give an example of evolution by natural selection to illustrate an idea of \"ordering\", what's really interesting is that first, even if I accepted this example at face value with no deeper consideration, you yourself just supplied an example of ordering that requires no institutionalized power structure basically admitting that for billions of years mother nature has proven that you don't need governments or economies to establish some kind of order. Interesting.\n\nHowever, I don't accept this analysis of evolution by natural selection because in your example you completely neglect interspecies (mutual aid) and intraspecies (symbiotic mutualism) cooperation which pretty much every evolutionary biologist recognizes as essential to the health of both individual species as well as entire ecosystems.\n\nLastly, Anarchism doesn't mean, \"no order\" or \"no organization\".  Proudhon, one of the first people to identify as a political Anarchist (1) had his saying, \"anarchy is order.\" Anarchism is the observation that people and communities are perfectly capable of organizing and working together amongst themselves, without coercion by an institutional power structure. In fact, some Anarchist theorists have observed that the human race for the majority of its existence organized itself in this way, along local, communal lines, without a formalized codified governmental or economic structure. So if you look at the big picture of the history of humanity, the hierarchical and coercive societies that started to develop a few thousand years ago are actually a bit of an aberration in the 200,000 odd years homosapiens have been around.\n\nFor immediate real world examples of this same thing, look at the aftermaths of natural disasters, especially ones where there's a catastrophic failure of government in managing the situation.\n\nLike, in my home country, in the United States, after hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and the complete failure of the Bush administration to adequately handle the situation, you had individual people hopping in their boats, running supplies to each other across rooftops and shelters. A bunch of regular people, in a bunch of aging motorboats were able to do what the United States Federal Government couldn't.\n\nAnd that's where the critical breakdown in pre-understanding of the issue of Anarchism comes in. Because again, Anarchism is just the observation that people are perfectly capable of organizing and coordinating themselves without any kind of formalized, codified government, or any kind of capitalist profit motive.\n\nIf you're interested, I can put together some reading materials on all of this.\n\n(1) - It's worth noting that there have been arguments that government is superfluous, immoral, and unnatural for thousands of years. However for the most part, these remained largely philosophical and\/or spiritual considerations, with only a small handful of examples of it being put into action, and it really wasn't until around the time if the French Revolution and its immediate aftermath that modern political Anarchism as we would recognize it today emerged.","created_utc":1528805050,"score":5,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

In fact, I suspect that a lot of people become cops because the want the chance to do those sorts of things. Or, at the very least, they want the opportunity to wield some amount of power over others.  \n\nI fully expect that no matter what tactic we use to bring down the system (and police forces along with it), be it peaceful or reactive in nature, the killings and beatings will become more intense. I don't pretend that having a one\\-on\\-one conversation with a cop will bring about some sweeping change, but maybe it could help save one person, one time and, frankly, that's enough motivation for me to do it. But screaming ACAB at a line of officers at a protest definitely isn't going to keep them from shooting anyone.  \n\nPeople talk a lot about how cops need to learn to deescalate situations in order for them not to become violent. I'm not interested in escalating a situation, or providing a source of stress that will help escalate a situation later. Yelling at a cop at a protest might not get *me* shot or hit, but it could be a factor in tipping that over later. Cops don't care about their public image. They care about enforcing their sense of order and control.\n\nThe cops, as an institution, have one role: domestic enforcement of systematic norms through violence.

{"author":"Fionnoh","body":"&gt;Okay, so let's break this down piece by piece.\n\n&gt;What the goal for a society is order...\n\n&gt;So first, without defining what you mean by \"order\", directly in the context of social organization and human behavior, this statement is almost meaningless.\n\nMeaningless? quoting Google here \"the arrangement or disposition of people or things in relation to each other according to a particular sequence, pattern, or method.\" \nTo arrange things in a particular sequence or way.\n\n&gt;Secondly, I would generally disagree with the idea that the goal of society is order, partly because \"society\" doesn't really have goals in the same way that individual people have goals. \"Society\" is just kind of an empty way of saying \"a group of people\" and unless that specific group of people chose to organize with each other with a specific end in mind, talking about a \"goal\" for the general case of \"society\" as an abstract concept, doesn't make any sense.\n\nA society is a group of people who arrange themselves in a certain way. E.g with jobs like farmers and bakers. They form a group to trade, communicate, protection and to breed which can all be summed up with surviving. These are the main reasons or \"goals\" they gather together as these goals are better accomplished when they organise themselves in a group like this.\n\n \n\n&gt;However, I don't accept this analysis of evolution by natural selection because in your example you completely neglect interspecies (mutual aid) and intraspecies (symbiotic mutualism) cooperation which pretty much every evolutionary biologist recognizes as essential to the health of both individual species as well as entire ecosystems.\n\nWell I didn't really go very deep into the different aspects of natural selection and evolution.\n\nI can only really explain these things by taking examples as that is the easiest way to explain it rather than taking abstractly.\nThe relationship  between a bee and a flower. The flower provides nector the bee pollinates. Neither are aware of what they are doing they evolved over time to do so by chance with the guidance of survival\n\nThe bee is just looking for food and accidentally pollinates the flower. The flower slowly over time by chance discovered that the sweater and more colourful the flower was the more likely it was to be pollinates so it became more colourful and produced more nector after each generation. This was guided not by the bee wanting to pollinate or the flowers goal   to feed the bee. They were both driven by the goal to survive. This is a trade like in all markets it is not done out of the kindness of the person but rather the need to survive and get the other object to benefit them.\n\nYou go on to argue and compare society to charity organisations that help people in need in natural disasters. And how if they can work together out of kindness rather  than selfishness.\n\nI have no doubt that a group can work together  selflessly for a selfless goal, but can a group work selflesly for a selfish goal.\n\nI don't think a group can work selflesly together for a selfish  goal like the survival of each individual. \n\nLets say theirs a pile of goods everyone does their jobs and puts their produce in the pile and takes what they need. \n\nThis is a very dumbed down version of what I think your idea would be if it's wrong then elaborate after.\n\nIf I take more than I need it helps me towards my goal of survival more than if i don't  so I would. Then someone sees that I'm taking more and they take more and the system breaks.\n\nMy argument against this is that I don't see how you would deal with people that take advantage of the system. I'm saying that in a reap what you sow money based system you can't reap if you don't sow but in this system someone could not sow as much because it's hard and reap more because it benefits their survival more with no repercussions as their is no governing system  to stop them or a money system to incentive them.\n\n","created_utc":1528811928,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

As I continued to analyze my politics, I realized I'd never considered economics (mainly because I at the time mistakenly conflated economics for finance, the latter of which is a soul-destroying thing).\n\nInitially, I was a social democrat because capitalism has a cult of personality in the US. But as time went on, and I started listening more to the far-left (shoutout LSR &amp; Badmouse), I became in every way except nominal a socialist. But I still denied it to myself and thought \"Surely, there's a way to fix this\".\n\nThen two particular far-right instances happened. The first was Brexit. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not gonna defend the EU, but the immediate fallout AFAIK was a spike in reactionary activity as well as the general death of social democracy in Europe, where it otherwise held somewhat firm ground. The other, and the more important one, was the election. Looking at it, it came down to neoliberalism or crypto-fascism. And at this point, the capitalist in me was broken.\n\nI realized \"There is nothing wrong. The system is behaving normally. All of this is normalcy\". And if this is the norm, then this is awful and must be done away with.

In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.\n\nMajor General Smedley D.

He has faced no consequences for the tweet, and the leaders of his party have so far remained silent.\n\n&gt;Mark Collett, whom King retweeted, isn\u2019t quiet about his beliefs. According to HuffPost, he\u2019s called himself a Nazi sympathizer, expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler and was the subject of the 2002 documentary \u201cYoung, Nazi and Proud.\u201d\n\n&gt;A year ago, he joined former KKK grand wizard David Duke for an hour-long discussion on, per Duke\u2019s website, \u201cthe massive violence that continues to be inflicted on the world by the Jewish dominated left.\u201d\n\n&gt;Last month, Duke joined Collett for the 50th episode of a YouTube chat show Collett hosts, \u201cThis Week on the Alt Right.\u201d Collett addressed Duke\u2019s critics on the show: \u201cAre they going to sacrifice everything to try and save their race, like David Duke has? Because that is the measure of a great man.\u201d In 2016, according to a Daily Mail report, Collett campaigned for Brexit in the UK alongside his swastika-tattooed girlfriend, Eva Van Housen.\n\n&gt;And yet the Republican Party maintained its silence Wednesday: TPM\u2019s requests for comment to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), the National Republican Campaign Committee and the Republican National Committee all went unanswered. None have commented publicly on King\u2019s retweet. King\u2019s office did not respond to TPM\u2019s questions.\n\n&gt;The amplification of a neo-Nazi is the latest in a years-long stream of similar actions from the Iowa congressman. In December, he tweeted \u201cDiversity is not our strength\u201d and attributed a quote to the right-wing Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban: \u201cMixing cultures will not lead to a higher quality of life but a lower one.\u201d Following President Donald Trump\u2019s January State of the Union address, King told TPM \u201cthe Congressional Black Caucus took a knee nearly all night.\u201d\n\n&gt;In March of last year, King was able to garner a rare response from his Republican colleagues when he tweeted \u201c[Anti-muslim Dutch politician Geert] Wilders understands that culture and demographics are our destiny.

{"author":"HaLoGuY007","body":"&gt;When Tommy Robinson, founder of the extreme right-wing group the English Defence League, was jailed recently, he was sentenced for breaching very clear and specific laws restricting what can be reported about ongoing legal proceedings. But the high-profile campaign that has sprung up to call for his release revolves around something quite different. It\u2019s all part of a well established, and highly effective, narrative of right-wing politics, which depicts people like Robinson as victims of a repressive state.\n\n&gt;Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley Lennon, was sentenced to 13 months in prison for live streaming outside a court where a rape trial was taking place. He did this despite a court ban on reporting details of the trial.\n\n&gt;Protesters held a rally in central London, waving British flags and carrying banners emblazoned with Robinson\u2019s face and the words \u201c#Free Tommy Robinson\u201d. They scuffled with police officers and some were arrested. The highlight of the rally was a speech by Geert Wilders, leader of the far-right Dutch Party for Freedom. Wilders told the crowd they were \u201call heroes\u201d before declaring Robinson the \u201cgreatest freedom fighter in Britain today\u201d. Hanging on the podium from which Wilders preached hung a banner showing Robinson in combat fatigues. The message was clear \u2013 Robinson is a hero and the victim of state political oppression.\n\n&gt;This narrative has gained significant traction thanks to the concerted efforts of the far right. Robinson\u2019s arrest sparked a highly stylised campaign, both on and offline, portraying him as merely exercising his right to free speech when he broadcast outside the court. He was protecting the public by \u201cexposing Muslim paedophiles\u201d \u2013 presumably a reference to the defendants in the case, who are innocent until proven guilty under UK law. The exact details of the case that Robinson was disrupting are at the moment unclear, due to the reporting ban \u2013 the ban that Robinson breached. However, Robinson likes to portray himself as a crusading journalist who \u201cexposes\u201d Muslim crimes.\n\n&gt;Depicting Robinson as a victim who was simply exercising his right to free speech is a strategic construction and an entirely false narrative. The facts regarding Robinson\u2019s imprisonment have nothing to do with free speech. He was jailed for contempt of court and for breaching a previous suspended prison sentence, also given for contempt of court (for filming inside Canterbury Crown Court during another rape trial).\n\n&gt;The remarks he made on the live stream outside Leeds Crown Court, according to the trial judge, were \u201chighly prejudicial to the defendants in the case\u201d and had the potential to cause a mistrial. That could potentially have cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, as well as forcing the alleged victims to have to go through the stress of another trial. Robinson pleaded guilty and expressed his \u201cdeep regret\u201d about his actions. His imprisonment was nothing to do with freedom of speech. It was to do with preventing a fair trial.\n\n&gt;**The cult of the victim**\n\n&gt;Far from being a new strategy, the cult of the victim is a major part of far-right identity construction. Robinson is particularly adept at playing his role as an idealised victim \u2013- a trope around which a range of dissatisfied individuals can coalesce with their complaints. The strategy pits the \u201cvictim\u201d against a perpetrator \u2013 in this case, the British political establishment.\nRobinson streams outside a court in April 2018. PA\n\n&gt;The construction of a victim identity is evident in the highly stylised online material that has been circulating on Facebook and Twitter since Robinson\u2019s imprisonment. A cover of the song \u201cHallelujah\u201d, produced with alternative words including \u201cpaedophiles are celebrated, Tommy Robinson is incarcerated\u201d, attacked the government and called for Robinson\u2019s release. The binary here is simplistically clear \u2013 either you are a Robinson supporter or you are a paedophile supporter.\n\n&gt;Ultimately, what lies behind the narratives of Robinson\u2019s victimhood is pretty standard Islamophobia. As the \u201cFree Tommy Robinson\u201d petition that has so far been signed by over 600,000 people tells us, \u201cTommy Robinson has been arrested and jailed for reporting on Muslim grooming gangs \u2026 informing the public of all the wrongs committed in the name of Allah\u201d.\n\n&gt;**Been here before**\n\n&gt;Supporters have campaigned against Robinson\u2019s imprisonment before. In 2012, when he was jailed for travelling to the US on a false passport, far-right supporters demonstrated outside Wandsworth prison wearing Tommy Robinson face masks and hailing him a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d. Back then, the narrative of Robinson as victim didn\u2019t secure much traction. It has found greater success in 2018 because Robinson\u2019s victimhood is contrasted with the predatory paedophilia of what the far right terms \u201cMuslim grooming gangs\u201d. The fact that the alleged real \u201cvictims\u201d in the Leeds case may have been forced to go through a retrial as a direct result of Robinson\u2019s actions is a point that is apparently lost on him and his supporters.\n\n&gt;Robinson and his fellow far-right supporters are aware that a sense of victimhood is a powerful tool for attracting support and encouraging collective action. In his biography, Enemy of the State, Robinson actually acknowledged the importance of being seen as the \u201cvictim\u201d. He enjoyed being in the minority during television debates because he knew that \u201cthe whole place was going to gang up on me and that I would come off as the victim \u2026 it was exactly as I wanted it to go\u201d.\n\n&gt;So Robinson\u2019s deliberate and sustained breach of court orders needs to be called out for exactly what they are \u2013- a calculated strategy rather than heroic self-sacrifice. Robinson and his allies in the far right have got exactly what they want \u2013 a martyr who will bring people together within an antagonistic discourse in which Robinson\u2019s suffering is contrasted against the alleged crimes of Muslims and the perceived politically correct totalitarianism of the British state.\n","created_utc":1528931213,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

The entire fucking movie is framed to show the horror of their rise to power, how they're no different from the original Nazi party, how they use lies to create fear of immigrants and terrorism to make immigrants afraid to live in Greece... How in the fuck do you imagine that to be \"a propaganda film by Golden Dawn?\" So arrogantly presumptuous. \n\nAs it happens, I am NOT opposed to all militant direct action. There is certainly a time and place for it. My point was that ALWAYS and IN THE PLACE OF CONSTRUCTIVE ORGANIZING is NOT the time and place for it. Giving one example of a violent action which was not productive =\/= some kind of pacifistic position where I condemn all violent actions, and it takes the same level of presumptiveness to assume that as it takes to assume that a clearly anti-Golden Dawn film (made by a heroic antifascist documentarian who put her life in danger to obtain the footage that she used to make the film) is \"pro-Golden Dawn propaganda by them.\" \n\nNo one on this planet would consider me a pacifist (I defend virtually every militant left-libertarian group in history). But you have to be smarter than that. Yes, militant opposition to fascism is anarchist and is a good thing. But that *does not mean* that shooting someone in the head or throwing a bomb or punching someone in the face is ALWAYS the right move in EVERY circumstance. Sometimes it is constructive, sometimes it *hurts our cause* in the bigger picture. If you actually care about the human consequences of the actions you're proposing, and not just feeling like a cool bad ass, then surely you agree. There are circumstances where committing a violent act against fascists could (a) fail, (b) put workers in immediate and unavoidable danger, (c) hurt the cause longer term and give fascists the upper hand. I don't think I'm \"against militant direct action\" for pointing out that basic strategic reality... Supporting militant action is necessary, *but not sufficient.* We need a lot more in our corner than a willingness to fight.\n\nAnd seriously.

Anarcho-communism is my utopia and this is true for many\/most\/maybe all? MLs. We believe in a strong dictatorship of the working class to set up the prerequisites for such a society before dissolving.\n\nThose prerequisite tasks are things like getting rid of class distinction by abolishing private property rights, redirecting labor from capitalist industries like marketing to useful industries like _anything else lol_ and facilitating that change, making the law actually fair, directing research towards things that will help us like automation, formulating plans to achieve full earth sustainability and facilitating that - the list goes on - ALL the while whilst juggling antirevolutionaries (like the flippin USA) trying to fuck your shit up and take power themselves.\n\nI will admit i have to read some more anarchist literature but it just seems unreasonable to me that anarchist groups, for all the amazing good stuff i do see them doing, are going to win a global war against capitalism.

Most of the rest of anarchist groups generally support the other anarchist ideologies and the differences are based on preferences\n\nThere are several anarchist groups that aren't an economic proposition but rather a social ideology. This means they are not mutually exclusive. Someone can be Anarcho-Pacifist, Anarcha-Feminist, and Queer-Anarchist simultaneously while also being for a specific anarchist economic system.\n\nI just generally call myself an anarchist. I'd be open to living in most anarchist economic systems and would happily live in any that came into existence. \n\nAs far as viability, Anarcho-Syndicalism seems to be a likely candidate because it has historical precedence (noteably 1930s Spain). It also is probably the most similar (as far as infrastructure) to our current system, being that it is industrial. Essentially the industries would be taken over by the workforce and federated, controlled in a democratic fashion.\n\nAnarcho-Primitivism is also personally appealing to me because life would be much more small scale and communal, and the effect that humans have on the planet and climate would be drastically cut. Essentially, humans would deindustrialize and form tribes living simply in nature. The historical precedents would be the many tribes of human history which were often egalitarian. While the lifestyle is appealing, I have reservations on medical care and also worry that it won't be well suited to my trans comrades.\n\nCommunalism I've only recently started looking into but it sounds appealing as well.\n\nSo basically anything anarchist and not capitalist I'm good with.

{"author":"BloodyCoast","body":"Anarchism is the idea that all government - all coercion - is undesirable and harmful and that it should be replaced by voluntary organizations. Anarcho-communists prefer entirely cooperative organizations. Anarcho-capitalists prefer competitive organizations. (It should be stated that anarcho-capitalists [or, Murray Rothbard, really] were stupid to call their system \"capitalism\"  because to socialists that just sounds like the present exploitative class system minus the welfare state, but that's not really what they mean by it.)\n\nPersonally I am a pan-anarchist. At this juncture of history, anyone who sincerely wants to abolish the state might as well be my brother. Almost every human believes in the legitimacy of government. Those of us who don't believe in it wish to replace coercive human social organization with all sorts of things... With the solidarity of a union of workers united against the stupid brutality of their exploitation.  With the camaraderie of shrewd business people who've determined never to be shoved around again. With the freedom of a wild tribe of hunters and gatherers who never want to see a clock again as long as they live. With the immense and intense solidarity of a particular cultural or ethnic group. Karl Hess had it right; anarchism is the hammer, smashing the chains; liberty is what results.\n\nHere's Karl Hess on the subject:\n\n\"There is only one kind of anarchist. Not two. Just one. An anarchist, the only kind, as defined by the long tradition and literature of the position itself, is a person in opposition to authority imposed through the hierarchical power of the state. The only expansion of this that seems to me to be reasonable is to say that an anarchist stands in opposition to any imposed authority.\nAn anarchist is a voluntarist.\n\n\"Now, beyond that, anarchists also are people and, as such, contain the billion-faceted varieties of human reference. Some are anarchists who march, voluntarily, to the Cross of Christ. Some are anarchists who flock, voluntarily, to the communities of beloved, inspirational father figures. Some are anarchists who seek to establish the syndics of voluntary industrial production. Some are anarchists who voluntarily seek to establish the rural production of the kibbutzim. Some are anarchists who, voluntarily, seek to disestablish everything including their own association with other people, the hermits. Some are anarchists who deal, voluntarily, only in gold, will never co-operate, and swirl their capes. Some are anarchists who, voluntarily, worship the sun and its energy, build domes, eat only vegetables, and play the dulcimer. Some are anarchists who worship the power of algorithms, play strange games, and infiltrate strange temples. Some are anarchists who only see the stars. Some are anarchists who only see the mud.\n\n\"They spring from a single seed, no matter the flowering of their ideas. The seed is liberty. And that is all it is. It is not a socialist seed. It is not a capitalist seed. It is not a mystical seed. It is not a determinist seed. It is simply a statement. We can be free. After that it\u2019s all choice and chance.\n\n\"Anarchism, liberty, does not tell you a thing about how free people will behave or what arrangements they will make. It simply says that people have the capacity to make arrangements.\n\n\"Anarchism is not normative. It does not say how to be free. It says only that freedom, liberty, can exist.\n\n\"Recently, in a libertarian journal, I read the statement that libertarianism is an ideological movement. It may well be. In a concept of freedom, it, they, you, or we, anyone has the liberty to engage in any ideology, in anything that does not coerce others, denying their liberty. But anarchism is not an ideological movement. It is an ideological statement. It says that all people have the capacity for liberty. It says that all anarchists want liberty. And then it is silent. After the pause of that silence, anarchists then mount the stages of their own communities and history and proclaim their, not anarchism\u2019s ideologies - they say how they, how they as anarchists, will make arrangements, describe events, celebrate life and work.\n\n\"Anarchism is the hammer-idea, smashing the chains. Liberty is what results and, in liberty, everything else is up to the people and their ideologies. It is not up to THE ideology. Anarchism says, in effect, there is no such upper case, dominating ideology.\n\n\"It says that people who live in liberty make their own histories and their own deals with and within it.\n\n\"A person who describes a world in which everyone must or should behave in a single way, marching to a single drummer, is simply not an anarchist. A person who says that they prefer this way, even wishing all would prefer that way, but who then says all must decide, may certainly be an anarchist. Probably is. Liberty is liberty. Anarchism is anarchism. Neither is Swiss cheese or anything else. They are not property. They are not copyrighted. They are old, available ideas, part of human culture. They may be hyphenated but they are not in fact hyphenated. They exist on their own. People add hyphens, and supplemental ideologies.\n\n\"I am an anarchist. I need to know that, and you should know it. After that, I am a writer and a welder who lives in a certain place, by certain lights, and with certain people. And that you may know also. But there is no hyphen after the anarchist.\n\n\"Liberty, finally, is not a box into which people are forced. Liberty is a space in which people may live. It does not tell you how they will live. It says, eternally, only that we can.\"","created_utc":1528951309,"score":9,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"c0ldcut","body":"Personally I think you should vote. I guess this is an unpopular opinion here. I feel like even if it legitimizes the system to some extent it\u2019s better to have some say in your rulers. Especially on a local level, where you can vote on things that will effect you more directly. Way I see it\u2019s better to vote for a candidate or policy you like even if your vote isn\u2019t the deciding vote. Politicians on some level need to try to win your vote over, even if they\u2019re more loyal to the dollar. If a large enough portion of the voters change who they\u2019re voting for politicians will try to change policies to win you over. If farmers make large portion of your base you need to make laws to appease them. If a large portion don\u2019t vote then politicians don\u2019t have to worry about their issues. This isn\u2019t always the case though. Sometimes not voting can be a way to show your political views. For example the people in have Puerto Rico boycotted the vote on whether or not to become a state. The low voter turnout made it so they couldn\u2019t count the vote as legitimate. But most cases where you don\u2019t vote you aren\u2019t seen as boycotting you\u2019re seen as being to lazy to vote. A boycott is organized and the reason for you not voting is clear. You can also protest the vote to make your voice more heard. But, not voting isn\u2019t going to make change unless to participate in other forms of making your voice heard in their stead. Politicians need to earn boycotted votes but not lazy ones. I know that a lot of anarchist disagree, but I really do think that simply ignoring one of your main ways to be heard isn\u2019t a good way to achieve your ends.

{"author":"PermanentTempAccount","body":"To be clear, I don't want a death penalty because I don't want a court system. If your model of justice looks like cops and judges and juries it's gonna act like cops and judges and juries, and all that's gotten us so far is a deeply racist criminal legal system built from the ground up to facilitate the exploitation and disposal of unwanted (poor, black, mentally ill, etc.) people. \"Innocence\" and \"guilt\" are concepts tied to the carceral system and they primarily serve to facilitate the dehumanization needed to support that system. As such, they are ultimately not just unhelpful but basically anathema to the world I want to help build.\n\nPrisons are just an imitation death, a kinder, gentler way of removing someone from your community with little regard for how it impacts that person and even less regard for how it impacts the people who live wherever that person ends up--not to mention the practical truth that it throws them into the jaws of the prison-industrial complex. What I'm suggesting is that if we got rid of that abstraction, that veneer, that layer of plausible deniability that lets us pretend prison isn't just slavery-and-death-by-other-names, if we actually required communities to take responsibility for how they treat people who cause harm, and to pull the fucking trigger themselves if they truly determine a person cannot help but hurt others, then we'd be *less* likely to throw people away like we do now. We'd be more likely to sit with people who cause harm, work with them to figure out why, and help change both themselves and the communities that lead them to behave that way.\n\nIn the end, I'm not willing to take killing off the table entirely because I think communities have a right to defend themselves against existential threats. But I do think if we treated killing, and its \"civilized\" surrogate exile, with the gravity they deserve, we'd be more able to see one another as human beings capable of (and responsible for) both harming and helping others. That basic humanization is a necessary part of building any functional anarchist community, and it's all but impossible while prisons exist to short-circuit our capacity for empathy.","created_utc":1529034497,"score":6,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"PuroKaos","body":"Well, the most important thing I have to say is that the first month is the hardest part. Once you make working out a habit, it will be much easier to maintain it, and you will even feel bad if for some reason you cannot work out in the day and you have to miss a session. So make the creation of this habit your main project for a month. If you manage, things will get easier.\n\nAlso, try to do something that is fun for you if possible. I find lifting weights boring as hell, and now that I don't compete in any sport anymore, I quit doing that. Now, I alternate between doing functional workouts, swimming, running, doing bag-work and climbing, so I have some variety and some fun. I also do a lot of things in my routine that help me to keep in shape anyway (chopping wood, carrying heavy stuff, walking long distances, etc)\n\nIf you are sedentary, take it easy at first. Start with something light and make it part of your routine, and build up from that. If you try to go too heavy right at the beginning, your performance will drop heavily after a few sessions and you might get hurt. You might also become frustrated because you cannot keep up with your initial goals. Also remember to focus on form  when exercising, and to try to find the correct form for  given exercises if you have no experience with it. This will make a huge fucking difference later on, and I cannot stress that enough.\n\nAs for motivation, I recommend watching a series or reading a book that motivates you somehow during that first month. In my case, I watched a series about boxing when I began to exercise again after being almost sedentary for a few years, since I'm really into martial arts. It really motivated me to train and get in shape. It has to be something that resonates with you though. Either way, good luck!

A smart person can score highly an abstract reasoning test even if they are anti-authoritarian, and a smart and hard-working\/dedicated person can do well on a skills\/knowledge test even if they are anti-authoritarian.\n\nYou can't get good grades unless you suck up and obey. Grading rewards blind obsequious submission and punishes independent thought and action.\n\n \u201cWell, that's pretty much what the schools are like, I think: they reward discipline and obedience, and they punish independence of mind. If you happen to be a little innovative, or maybe you forgot to come to school one day because you were reading a book or something, that's a tragedy, that's a crime\u2015because you're not supposed to think, you're supposed to obey, and just proceed through the material in whatever way they require.\nAnd in fact, most of the people who make it through the education system and get into the elite universities are able to do it because they've been willing to obey a lot of stupid orders for years and years\u2015that's the way I did it, for example. Like, you're told by some stupid teacher, \"Do this,\" which you know makes no sense whatsoever, but you do it, and if you do it you get to the next rung, and then you obey the next order, and finally you work your way through and they give you your letters: an awful lot of education is like that, from the very beginning. Some people go along with it because they figure, \"Okay, I'll do any stupid thing that asshole says because I want to get ahead\"; others do it because they've just internalized the values\u2015but after a while, those two things tend to get sort of blurred. But you do it, or else you're out: you ask too many questions and you're going to get in trouble.\nNow, there are also people who don't go along-and they're called \"behavior problems,\" or \"unmotivated,\" or things like that. Well, you don't want to be too glib about it\u2015there are children with behavior problems but a lot of them are just independent-minded, or don't like to conform, or just want to go their own way. And they get into trouble right from the very beginning, and are typically weeded out. I mean, I've taught young kids too, and the fact is there are always some who just don't take your word for it. And the very unfortunate tendency is to try to beat them down, because they're a pain in the neck. But what they ought to be is encouraged. Yeah: why take my word for it? Who the heck am I? Figure it out for yourself.

{"author":"Telkk","body":"Actually, it's racist not to say black people.  The only people who say African American or people of color are either white people who don't wish to offend, college kids who know nothing about the World, and black people who feel awkward saying black in front of white people because they're afraid of offending.  Every close black friend of mine including my family from the hood insist that I use the word black and they only say those pc words when they're in a formal setting because they're afraid of offending.  The irony is too much!\n\nThe word itself is exclusionary to black people and inaccurate when describing most black people in America.  Again, i know this because they tell me this.  Not educated rich black kids.  Actual poor black people living in the worst areas America has to offer.  Calling someone African American or person of color is automatically creating a label that separates them from this Country.  Oh, no they're not Americans with black skin.  They're African American, as if Africa is a Country and they're actually from it.  And people of color?  Well, that's dumb because everyone is a person of color!\n\nIt's shameful to call them anything but people who happen to have darker complextions because anything else means you're putting them in a politically charged category that they don't even want to be a part of.  And again, how do I know this?  Because I actually lived with poor black people for a very long time and every single one of them, other than college kids were secretly offended by those words.  But you'll never hear that conversation because they won't tell that to white people because they don't want to come off as that asshole who has to correct the pc culture.  \n\nAlso, how is my post wildly incoherent?  When I mean scientific approach I mean examining the psychological effects of hood life and suburban life and closely examining how and why individuals respond in the way that they do on both sides.  I mean have you ever wondered why racism exists in the first place?  Have you ever seriously wondered why hoods still exist when we clearly created equal opportunity for blacks?  I mean, seriously.  Name one institution or person who is emphatically using racism to further entrench black communities in poverty?  And I mean a concrete analysis that genuinely proves that racism is the main driver, not, \"Oh well I can't understand why they're hurting black communities so it has to be racism\".  Hurting black communities does not necessarily equal racism.  It could mean many things and unless We're willing to carefully examine the situation, which We're not, then we'll never be able to solve these issues.   \n\nIt's embarrassing that we still have poor black urban areas, but its even more embarrassing when the solutions are hitting us right in the face and we don't even see it or acknowledge it.\n\nWe need gentrification in these areas, but it needs to be done right.  The government should give tax credits to businesses developing in these areas while barring them from raising prices, so that the original inhabitants can reap the benefits of living in a good area instead of being forced to leave.  We need to also subsidize contractors pay and favor employing residents over outsiders to build it.  Doing so will create employment opportunities and by subsidizing contractors pay we can keep labor costs down for businesses looking to develop.  \n\nBut that's not what's most important.  Creating an infrastructure for economic and social development can only sustain itself if we have educational institutions that not only teach the basics, but also things that are practical for poor people living hand to mouth.  After all, these areas can't be artificially sustained by government intervention for the indefinite future.  At some point these areas need to sustain themselves and I believe the key is in how we educate people.\n\nBasically, we have an education that doesn't make much sense for a kid in the hood.  He's forced to either live in poverty or figure out how to secure hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans to go to a school that will teach them nothing about how to thrive in the real world.  \n\nThen, they go to the interviews, but they dont get jobs and thats because the person sitting across from them doesn't understand him and vis versa.  And because the kids not only a victim of impoverishment but also culturally different from the interviewer, communicating and understanding one another will be difficult and this is even more challenging because we continue to give credence to race, so naturally we use it to foster differences, which means both individuals will hold a certain bias opinion of the other due to actions from pc culture.\n\nSo, basically if you really think about it, the biggest culprit is money due to our economic system.  We have a whole new system right in front of us everyday and every kid in the hood has one.  It's a smart phone.  And with a smart phone you can get yourself out of poverty.  You just need to know how to use it.\n\nKids only know social media and entertainment.  They don't know how to start their own business online or sell a service that they're personally interested in.  My dad bought a camera flash for four dollars and sold it online for 100.  All he had to do was go to a thrift store.  My brother with only a few hundred dollars started a beard and mustache wax company that he sold for thousands and that was only because it was growing too big and he wanted to move on to something else.  Another friend of mine, a \"person of color\" is a professional poker player whose self taught.  Another friend of mine taught himself graphic designing and is making thousands every month.\n\nIt's called the internet and if we can teach kids how to make money right now by doing what they want, they don't have to go to college or assimilate in this white world.  And even if they don't know what they want to do, just by teaching them how to discover what they want to do, you can free them from having to choose between being poor and assimilating in a foreign culture.  \n\nBut that only happens when we get them out of poverty so not only do we need infrastructural changes but overall minimum wage across the board needs to increase so we have a much higher safety net and we need to expand our welfare programs so that they don't have to worry as much.  \n\nI think if we start taking these steps we can begin to solve these problems once and for all.  They need our help, but they don't need to be politicized as a race.  That's what assholes do.  It would be interesting to hire the greatest minds across the world to come together and study this problem as deeply as humanly possible so that we can form an accurate policy that's practical, easy on the wallet, and one that will alleviate the crisis instead of furthering the divide.  \n\n\n","created_utc":1529072618,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Race is just a man made concept, so it's not actually a real thing in and of itself other than to describe how we've categorized and apparently still continue to do so.\n\nBut to answer you question as clearly as I can, statistics are only data.  There isn't any meaning behind it, which means its subject to being misunderstood unless we carefully examine and consider the nuances at the ground level so that we can create an accurate explanation for why the data exists.  \n\nIf we say its racism then we're doing a disservice to ourselves because we're choosing to assume that the data means institutional racism when it could in fact mean something entirely different and more complicated, but none-the-less important to understand.  \n\nAnd that's why my approach would work because I don't think we're examining the nuances as carefully as we should.  I'm not saying I have all the answers.  Hell, I just have a rough framework and its not even that unique.  There are many who share these thoughts.  But I do know that if we listen to science instead of political bullshit we'll see that we're all a bunch of stupid monkeys fighting each other over problems we can't even comprehend because we don't have the mental tools to help us understand why its a problem to begin with.\n\nFor instance, do you know why Europeans really decided to become racist and commit the worst genocide in modern history?

If we can understand why all of us have the capacity for hate, among other human emotions we can understand why things like the hood exist.  We can solve all of our problems if we look within ourselves and understand the meta cognitive processes that motivate us into conflicts because by understanding the problem at that level, we can begin to consciously shift ourselves out of this hell hole because we'll have been provided with the mental tools to regulate ourselves better.","created_utc":1529075828,"score":0,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

So make the creation of this habit your main project for a month. If you manage, things will get easier.\n\nDefinitely true in my personal experience. I used to be borderline obese about 8 years ago when I was about 15 when I decided to completely give-up junk-food and religiously go to the gym. I went pretty much every day for 4.5 years. I'd only missed the **very** rare day and even made sure to *double out* the next day so that my missed day *didn't count.* I know, that was excessive... But, I was eventually about 2 years into university and just started missing days, eating the occasional sugary cookie, eating bigger portions of the meals I used to have, and getting slightly depressed overall because I'd started disliking my degree program and it was getting demanding. It even got to a point where I'd more or less stopped weight-training for about a year (although, I did cardio on and off).\n\nNevertheless, I managed to get my shit together over the last 1 year or so and dropped the 10 excess kgs I'd gained and went back to going to the gym religiously, this time with a somewhat altered and slightly more lax routine and an even better diet than during those 4.5 years and it's been great but my main point is that, when I started falling out of working out 2 years into Uni for about 1-2 years; it was really grueling. I'd weirdly start getting very oily skinned when it was the time of day for me to normally workout (I'd sometimes even sweat a bit despite not exerting myself), I'd also get these slight headaches and become irritable. It was seriously like my body had gotten so used to working out that I was suffering pseudo withdrawal symptoms. Not to mention the guilt... One will definitely become pretty attached to going once they make it enough of a habit, I think.\n\n_____\n\nAs for advice from me...

Try to cover your bases from the start. Watch useful YouTube videos about the proper ways to eat and workout. Hell, even read books... Don't auto-pilot it like I originally did where I just sort of used *common sense* to grasp what was healthy and not healthy and then just worked out and figured it out as I went. I did get into decent shape back then but, looking back, there was a lot I could've improved if I'd done some proper research beyond the occasional YouTube video for so and so muscle workout. I could've avoided a lot of my fear as well.\n\nTry to become knowledgeable early, and jot down a proper path for yourself because once you know what must be done and how to do it; all you'll need is that sliver of motivation (and time) to get it done and, frankly, having a **very** proper path set out in your head probably will help with that motivation problem.

But the outside help that's providing is horribly misguided and dare I say, patronizing and ultimately seeks to undermine black development by trying to assimilate them in a system that's broken and antiquated.\n\nSecond, let me expand on your history lesson so that we can better understand the situation.  Let's go back further.  I'm talking millions of years ago.  Most white people from Europe developed into more advanced and industrious societies not because of race superiority but because of geological reasons.  We happened to live in an environment where there was more fertile land to grow crops, we had loads of wheat, and even animals to domesticate, so it was only a matter of time before we grew into more complex systems.\n\nBut what about Africa?  Well, they didn't have as much fertile land nor animals to domesticate or large quantities of crops to sustain large complex societies and even though kingdoms formed, they were limited in growth and division of labor due to geological reasons.  \n\nSo what does that mean?  It means different cultures formed as a consequence of environmental factors so when white people who were technologically more advanced came across Africans they wondered what was going on and why they were so wierd and strange and why do they seem to be inferior to them?  Why were they not as technologically advanced as Euopeans.  This plagued intellectual thought for some time and with misconceptions from science we developed racism as the explanation for such differences and since they were seen as genetically inferior, they could and should be morally enslaved so that they could be put to good use.   I don't think this, of course, but racists back in the day did.  \n\nSo we pretty much used them as free labor for hundreds of years and that created a lot of complex consequences that We're still seeing and feeling to this day.  We ended slavery about 150 years ago and we're just now learning how to not be racist.  We opened up the gates and told people whom have been obsessed for generations to go out in the white world and assimilate.  And many did, but there are many who still remain in the ghosts of past injustices i.e the hood.\n\nSo yes, racism created inner cities, but does racism sustain those inner cities, today.  I'm not quite convinced that it's as simple as that.  I think it's fuel for people to justify their sentiments against poor black people and to say, \"well, if they can't fix their problems then good riddance.\"  And that's a horrible outlook, but is that racism or simply ignorance and the sense that nothing can be done?  \n\nAll I'm saying is that if we view it through the scope of oppressors and victims, then a lot of people are going to be hurt mentally and physically.  But if we examine it carefully, we can develop real pragmatic steps to end this bullshit.  ","created_utc":1529082797,"score":0,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"SocialJusticeBrawler","body":"&gt; \nBut to answer you question as clearly as I can, statistics are only data. There isn't any meaning behind it, which means its subject to being misunderstood unless we carefully examine and consider the nuances at the ground level so that we can create an accurate explanation for why the data exists.\n\nThis examination is a fundamental part of doing statistical research. Nobody in the world produces purely data statistics, researchers are constantly interpreting their data in exactly the way you're \"proposing\" here. Racial bias is a huge thing to conclude and usually requires overwhelming evidence to be taken seriously.\n\n&gt; if we say its racism then we're doing a disservice to ourselves because we're choosing to assume that the data means institutional racism when it could in fact mean something entirely different and more complicated, but none-the-less important to understand.\n\nYeah, you know there's lots of well-ground research demonstrating it is institutional, right? People don't just examine the number of, say, imprisoned black people and go racial bias, they examine arrest, and sentancing numbers (and much more) to acheive a full insitutional picture. Once again, you're just assuming nobody is doing the kind of reseach you think is right, but they totally are - are you a professional statistician? If not, where are you getting these assumptions about how data is used and interpreted?\n\n&gt; And that's why my approach would work because I don't think we're examining the nuances as carefully as we should. I'm not saying I have all the answers. Hell, I just have a rough framework and its not even that unique. There are many who share these thoughts. But I do know that if we listen to science instead of political bullshit we'll see that we're all a bunch of stupid monkeys fighting each other over problems we can't even comprehend because we don't have the mental tools to help us understand why its a problem to begin with.\n\n&gt; I don't think we're examining the nuances as carefully as we should\n\nOnce again - why not? You're assuming the quality of discourse on race on the fucking Internet represents the the status of empirical research, which, shocker, it doesn't - big whoop. Everything in this post indicates that you don't really know anything about this stuff - why no references to existing racial research? Why not apply your idea that existing research is too emotionally driven on research that already exists? Because you don't know any of it, but are comfortable assuming that racism basically isn't real and is just emotional race-baiters. Trust us - not everyone is making nonstop references to cutting-edge research on race, but that's a factor of the Internet being shitty, not the research not being done.\n\n&gt; For instance, do you know why Europeans really decided to become racist and commit the worst genocide in modern history? Read Jared Diamond. The truth is much more bizarre and complicated than white people being bad and hateful. If we can understand why all of us have the capacity for hate, among other human emotions we can understand why things like the hood exist. We can solve all of our problems if we look within ourselves and understand the meta cognitive processes that motivate us into conflicts because by understanding the problem at that level, we can begin to consciously shift ourselves out of this hell hole because we'll have been provided with the mental tools to regulate ourselves better.\n\nJared Diamond is a fucking joke and a hack who should keep his worthless, unfounded fucking opinions out of a decent field like history. There are several answers to this on the extraordinary \/r\/AskHistorians (https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/2mkcc3\/how_do_modern_historians_and_history\/). It doesn't surprise me in the least you're a fan, but trust me when I say Diamond is not someone you should be looking to when it comes to history.\n\nHonestly mate, I'm done here - nothing you say seems based on anything but your willingness to assume bad faith and bad research on the part of anyone supporting the premise that there might be racial bias in institutions - something you've done absolutely nothing to meaningfully criticize, other than insist - without evidence - that all existing research is wrong and bad. You do not have to expertise to claim literally any of the things you claim here. Feel free to respond with more platitudes about human nature and how understanding each other will destroy the hood and shit, though.

{"author":"Throwaway18384018308","body":"Ex-Christian Communist here (not sure if I was what you had in mind but gonna comment anyways) and will answer accordingly:  \n\n\n1a) I left because I remember when I was in high school when I happened upon *God on Trial* which is the story of how in Auschwitz a group of Jews put God on trial for violating his covenant with the Jewish people. And it really stuck with me because, my country\/culture was one of the first to accept Christianity (I am Ethiopian) and yet we have been brutalized by imperialists and conquerors with suffering without end. And I realized \"If this is how god treats people who had prayed and worshiped and begged for help for centuries and received nothing, he's either unbelievably cruel or not worth worshiping because he's ineffectual\". After that, the idea of praying to a god who's at best unable to help and at worst unimaginably cruel left a bad taste in my mouth.   \n\n\n1b) My inspiration to become a communist was seeing how so many people in South America, Asia and Africa are being exploited and there really is no way to continue this without a major shift in how the world operates: Since I live in America I realize yet have visited my family who still live in Ethiopia, I realized that I no more of a right to the life of comparative luxury and ease and I got it because I was frankly born lucky, so the only way to make things right is to make things equal (returning the means of production to the people, making sure that they have just as much of an equal footing as I do).  \n\n\n2) I don't think they are mutually exclusive, it depends on one's interpretation (I can't speak to Hinduism and Islam but I can speak to christianity). If one sees The Bible not as the actions of a vengeful god and a warning to those who incur his wrath but rather as stories and fables to encourage how to live one's life (love thy neighbor; always practice charity, etc.) and recognize that its a book that's thousands of years old and parts of it have no place in modern society then there is absolutely a place for it in communism and anarchism. Thinking to Martin Luther and how he revolted against Catholic excesses and tried to create a system that encouraged individuals to seek their own interpretations of the Bible and other holy texts as a more individualistic, decentralized religious structure that seems more in line with my views imo (one's faith is between them and god imo and no one can get in the way of that).  \n\n\n3) I don't have much knowledge of religious anarchist movements tbh, but I have a limited understanding of Liberation theology and they seem like a group of people I'd be willing to work with for a better future for everyone because they espouse the better ideals of christianity\/other religions: the communal aspects such as caring for one another and trying to create a better future.  \n","created_utc":1529124132,"score":5,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

The Bazacle dam was upstream of the Daurade dam, and had illegally built their dam higher than allowed--this meant that none of the mills at the Daurade dam had enough water power to work properly. Daurade went to the courts, and actually won their initial action. The owners of the Bazacle dam were ordered to pay considerable damages and lower the height of the dam.

But I think there is effectively enough crossover for me to contribute to discussion.  \n\nI never really left Christianity  (I mean, I don't go to church and haven't for a while, but that is a miniscule secondary facet to Christianity imo). I think my break from religiousness though began when I realized that many of the social rules upheld by the church had zero basis for practice from the Bible itself. For instance, using curse words, male\/female roles in church, wearing \"nice\" clothing out of \"respect\", and when I was older realizing drug and alcohol use doesn't make you a heathen. Additionally, when you have the rules that one must do xyz to get to heaven, I began wondering what happened with the generations of people around the world who weren't exposed to Christianity for geographical reasons. Did centuries of people go to hell just out of an innocently pure ignorance? This seemed more a problem with the xyz prescription of Christian practice to me than the actual theology itself.  \n\nI came to the conclusion that socialism is actually more compatible than capitalism with regards to the teachings of Jesus. It was more or less because of Christianity that I found myself becoming a leftist. Subsequently, socialist flirtation morphed into anarchist conclusions. \n\nMy religious nihilism is more or less thanks to Kierkegaard. I have essentially come to the conclusion that the question of whether or not God exists is irrelevant because there is no material or epistemological reason for me to tell if something happens because it was a divine intervention or the will of God. For me, if God created the universe, the laws of physics, humans and their rational capacities, then he can't possibly be limited by these factors in the same way humans are. My conclusion is that God is unknowable from a human perspective, and I can't possibly recognize whether something occurs as an act of God. To continue to believe in this God seemed to be a more radical degree of faith than those who fool themselves into believing that they hear God's voice or see God \"moving in their lives,\" thus giving themselves madeup proofs of his existence to desperately sustain their \"faith\". I simply cannot recognized God in anything material and see zero proof for believing in his existence, yet I chose to believe based entirely on pure faith. But it is a belief, in my opinion, that leaves me with a completely open field of option in terms of my actions: I am free to do whatever I want. My belief in God is my own personal choice and I couldn't give a shit what anyone else chooses to believe, i.e. I'm not someone who converts others.

He's a liberal and a thoughtful, compassionate guy who hoped that he could be a positive influence in the force.

They destroyed the house, arrested all who were there and held them without charges until the Monsanto summit was over. Mike arrested a few people because of the vitamins in their vehicle and was part of a force that was rounding up weirdos on bikes around town, locked them up and destroyed the bikes. I could go on with more ridiculous stories of those two days, but suffice it to say that they acted illegally and eventually the department lost a large class-action law suit brought by those arrested.\n\nMy point is that no matter how conciensious an officer is, they are a tool of the state who's primary objective is to protect wealth and to scapegoat the poor.

{"author":"MsExmusThrowAway","body":"I'm an ex-Muslim tankie but I'll answer you anyway.\n\n1. I had strong doubts about Islam all throughout my teen years. My parents, especially my father, were very right-wing, not \"fundamentalist\" per se, but definitely traditional to the point of tyrannical. I left my parents' house at 18 and never looked back, went to college, got a job, lived on my own, got a BA degree. Marxism appealed to me a lot, because it gave me answers Islam couldn't. I was taught my whole life to rely on faith alone, that Islam was perfect, that all the answers where in Qur'an and Hadith, etc. But deep inside I knew it wasn't true. I discovered Marxism while in college and never looked back.\n\n2. From a Marxist perspective, no, Islam is not defensible. Islam has a very strong class character, supports property \"rights\", allows for exploitation, never condemns wealth itself (only hoarding wealth), relies on top-down methods for dealing with social inequality, believes in a static political entity (Khilafah), holds an idealist and outright undialectical view of history, and upholds a fucking warlord who did all sorts of fucked up things. Marxism and Islam are like day and night when it comes to epistemology. I've heard \"apologists\" make the claim that Qur'an is written from the point-of-view of historical materialism as it (allegedly) describes class struggle. *However* the kind of struggle which the Qur'an talks about is not at all related to class, but related to believers vs. non-believers. Islam does not believe in class struggle at all. Poverty is dealt with through zakat (charity) not workers rising up and seizing the means of production (which is considered haram as Allah allows for exploitative property ownership). Family is another big issue: Marxists understand the nature of the family to be related to property ownership, whereas Muslims understand the family to be something Allah demands. Gender roles are extremely rigid as well.\n\n3. I don't understand what you mean by similar or different. Historically speaking, religious Muslims sided with communists and anarchists only out of convenience, i.e. they were fighting a much larger enemy (Christian monarchies, colonialism, Israel); I highly, highly doubt religious Muslims would side with comrades over a Khilafah. Many of those Arab secularists with socialist leanings were educated in the West. The Muslim communists who I know personally are either more one or the other. For example, the more \"communist\" Muslims practice Islam in a pretty liberal fashion, to the point where I doubt any devoted Muslim would consider what they practice \"Islam\". The more \"Muslim\" types are, like I said, pretty much socialists only because they like the anti-war and pro-Palestine stuff and not because they adhere to any scientific understanding of socialism.\n\n4. I can't think of any Marxist critiques of Islam off the top of my head but there has to be some.","created_utc":1529205367,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I'm a parent, and as most parents will attest, we will do anything to ensure our kids are healthy, happy and well loved.  Can you imagine what you would do &amp; sacrifice to help a sick child or another loved one heal and get better?\n\nThat said, I feel that this post lacks direction or constructiive advice for anyone who wants to experience more freedom in their lives.  As a self-proclaimed Anarchist myself, I personally feel that Anarchism as a movement will never take root without other positive anarchists constructively providing good examples of how to live a better life with more personal freedom.  Most (not all) of all the anarchist posts I read seem to be whining about how \"unfair\" the current capitalistic system is, and usually never proposing a realistic solution to help others potentially enjoy a better life.  Rarely do these posts offer real life examples of successful practices put in to action.\n\nDestroying small businesses, smashing windows, and spray painting anarchist symbols &amp; slogans on walls doesn't do anything positive for anyone, other than alienate most people from the idea that there could be a better way to live together in peace.\n\nInstead of acting angry and aggressive with what is essentially a failed political theory, I would suggest sharing anarchist ideologies with humor, friendliness, love, and most importantly real life solutions.  Try to make people who don't know anything about Anarchism comfortable asking more questions.  Make them more curious about your political ideologies by showing them how happy you are to be living and practicing your beliefs.  Be positive and show others that there is actually another way to live that provides more personal freedom and happiness for your personal life.   Show them that you live a great lifestyle.\n\nYes, others are suffering terribly all over the world, but anarchism is not about protest or fighting the system.  Protest is an act encouraging change, but it's not anarchism.\n\nRegarding fellow anarchists discussing how waged employment is basically another form of slavery --- I don't necessarily disagree.\n\nOne workable solution is to promote self-employment or self-sufficiency.  I've worked for people &amp; corporations in the past and absolutely hated it.  It was soul crushing.  I eventually started working for myself....and for the first 5 years, it ended up requiring 10 x the amount of work I ever gave to my employers....though it was far more fulfilling to me.  I would often work from 9am - midnight+, 7 days a week.  In the end, this endeavor was just a stepping stone to a more sustainable freedom.  I now work for myself and have no employees.  I have lots of free time and live a happy, fulfilling life.  When someone is interested and asks me about my thoughts on Anarchism, I try to share my ideas -- even though I am admittedly not very eloquent....though I think they see that I am happy and fulfilled.\n\nIf one doesn't like working for other people, then why not work for yourself?  Most of us are free to choose.  Lots of self-motivated people do it everyday and are quite successful at it.  With the advent of the internet, it's even easier today to be self-employed and to live without borders.  In fact, I do know quite a few anarchists that do just this and float between countries each year.  I would like to see it discussed (or even promoted) more often as an alternative to working as an employee for someone else.","created_utc":1529206151,"score":-3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

But the understandings of the greater part of men are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments. The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects are perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become.\n\n...\n\n&gt;It is otherwise in the barbarous societies, as they are commonly called, of hunters, of shepherds, and even of husbandmen in that rude state of husbandry which precedes the improvement of manufactures and the extension of foreign commerce. In such societies the varied occupations of every man oblige every man to exert his capacity and to invent expedients for removing difficulties which are continually occurring. Invention is kept alive, and the mind is not suffered to fall into that drowsy stupidity which, in a civilised society, seems to benumb the understanding of almost all the inferior ranks of people.

If anything it's discriminatory to take him off death row just because he's gay.\n\nIn addition, whether he is gay or not isn't the issue. He murdered someone, as a fact. Death row was already on ther table for cold-blooded murder. Your original point, if may quote you, was \"*He was put in a position to be forced to take a life in order to survive*\". That is factually incorrect. He did not kill in self-defense. The worst case scenario if he DIDN'T murder the guy, was jail. Instead he got death row for murdering a guy. It's that simple. He was not forced to rob his employers, he was not forced to kill a man, he did it because he's a fucking scumbag, a boil on the skin of society. It has nothing to do with him being gay, he's a bad fucking person. \n\nEdit: Oh, and after looking through your comments, you have said very little on the topic of justice in an anarchist society... So I will ask again, so as to get an actual answer. **What do you do, with murderers, in your ideal anarchist society?**","created_utc":1529254370,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

That's easy.\n\nFrom [this interview](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/books\/booksblog\/2014\/nov\/19\/iain-banks-culture-lives-on-strange-horizons):\n\n&gt;\u201cMany critics and reviewers have claimed that the Culture represents the American Libertarian ideal. Given that this is clearly not the case, how do you characterise the politics of the Culture?\u201d asks Roberts. \u201cReally? I had no idea,\u201d replies Banks. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: unless I have profoundly misunderstood its position, I pretty much despise American Libertarianism. Have these people seriously looked at the problems of the world and thought, \u2018Hmm, what we need here is a bit more selfishness\u2019? \u2026 I beg to differ.\u201d\n\nHe's clearly writing about the world he wants to see, it's not meant to be a critique of the 'post scarcity anarchy' politics he presents, but a promotion of them. These books aren't dystopias.\n\n&gt;He has never used the word \"anarchism\" in the novels. The Culture is only ever presented as \"The Culture.\"\n\nHe uses the words 'anarchy' and 'socialism' and 'post scarcity' to describe the Culture in various writings and interviews (and I only just started digging into this world today). [Example.](http:\/\/www.vavatch.co.uk\/books\/banks\/cultnote.htm) \n\n[This is the article](https:\/\/www.tor.com\/2013\/04\/08\/iain-m-banks-culture-spits-in-the-eye-of-nihilism\/) that first alerted me to the colonialism that his 'anarchist' culture features.\n\nOnly 2 random ebooks were available with seeds on thepiratebay, so I got the audiobooks and have been listening from the first one (Consider Phlebas) highly sped up, while also digging through a wiki that explains the whole world and skimming through the two ebooks I was able to download (Excession and Hydrogen Sonata). I'm not sure what the point of quoting from the books is when you've already asserted it's not a promotion of those politics and I disagree. \n\nHe clearly thinks this is an aspirational model from his interviews and has defended the way of life he presents in the books several times (I read everything I could find about him before even started the books). \n\nThere's little difference between The Dispossessed and these books re: promoting a certain way of life. They both push certain political ideals and the people reading will be influenced by them politically for generations. I've already seen anarchists on this sub celebrating his books as a great representation of anarchy worth aspiring to. \n\nThat being said, I've only just started digging into the books so that could change.

It's a story of a post-coup fascist society of America that is heavily influenced by early Puritanic\/Protestant societies and religious law.  It is told from the perspective of a slave who's sole purpose in this new society is to provide a fertile womb for men of a certain class.  I give it an A+ would suggest it to anyone interested in anarchism\/feminism\/socialism and fiction.\n\n*Concept of the Political* was a bit of a political theory slog by a Nazi jurist\/political theorist.  The book itself was written during the Weimar Republic, and though Schmitt does not advocate for the nazi party at any point, that is unfortunately the route he ended up on later in his life.  The rather long essay focuses on how *politics* as he defines it is at its core a distinction between us and them, what he calls the *friend\/enemy distinction*.  It was a very interesting read that mostly dealt with a critique of liberalism, but from the other side of the spectrum than I think most of us would be used to.  Truth be told I took it on because I had to read it in one of undergraduate theory classes and wanted to have another go at it to see if I could get anything more out of it.  I'd maybe give it a B?  I don't know kind of hard to rate this one\n\n*Theory of Politics and Zombies* is basically perfect companion book to an International Relations 101 class.  The basic premise is, \"There's been a zombie outbreak.  How can we predict how states will act?  Let's use a realist perspective, a liberal perspective, a neoconservative perspective, etc. to investigate.\"  It was an incredibly quick read for me, I knocked it out in 2 days without any difficulty, though someone unfamiliar with basic international relations theories might take a bit longer.  Intellectually I got very little out of it, but it was a fun read and I think fits a very good niche that is filled by other books like *Philosophy and Harry Potter*.

You can't just say no to living or throw yourselves off the cliff because you don't want to harm animals, but these are literally the only means of survival. What would you do then?\n\nTo note this, indigenous people around the world live this life everyday. I remember some vegan anarchists on here said disrespectfully that indigenous lifestyle are 'backward' and 'outdated'. Well, since the military applied these 'backward' knowledge to survival, especially when SHTF, what would you do then?\n\nThis also weight in the privilege of hipster anarchists living in urban or suburban with abundant life while they completely tuned out how different is the rest of the world survive.\n\nI'm speaking as a concern, as an agricultural engineer who spent years in indigenous and refugee communities with WFP and UNHCR.","created_utc":1529266079,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"PoorestPigeon","body":"Which part? \n\nIn the original conception of free speech, it was explicitly meant as a promise that the state wouldn't punish you for criticizing it. It's a negative freedom - a freedom *from*. \n\nThe idea of that freedom-from as being something you should take seriously rests upon your belief that that the state will keep that promise. And, I promise you, the state does not keep that promise. Walk up to a police officer and insult him incessantly - I guarantee that the state, as represented by it's agent, will punish you for insulting it. \n\nAll \"rights\" are similar - they are promises made by the state regarding things that it will or (much more commonly) will not do to you. However, the state is vastly more powerful than you and -for a variety of reasons- cannot be trusted. Therefor, taking it's promises to signify some bed-rock feature of your political reality is the height of foolishness. \n\nWhat you should *actually* be looking at is *power*, not rights - specifically, who was what sort of power over who else. Those competing and (more often) cooperating hierarchies show the *actual* bedrock of your everyday political reality. Therefore, it is meaningless to speak of free speech or unfree speech - no such things can be said to exist; categorizing speech as free or unfree is a category error. \n\nMore concretely, it is even more silly to speak of \"free speech\" as a freedom-*to*, a positive freedom - a freedom to say anything to any party(s) you like (being heard by them) without suffering any negative consequence for doing so. No one in any (as far as I am aware, but I admit that I am neither a historian nor an anthropologist, and would be fascinated to be proven wrong) society has ever been legally obligated to let anyone who wanted use their printing press, radio station, website, or subreddit to say whatever they wanted - further, no one has been obligated to listen to and spend time and effort comprehending messages from *just* anyone who wished to speak to them - and, further, after saying something insulting or otherwise offensive to the wrong person (i.e., their boss, the mayor, ect) they have generally had to -at least- apologize. However, pretty much every society in history has had *some* people who *could* say whatever to whoever and be heard, with virtually no consequence for doing so. This has been and is generally whoever has any appreciable amount of political and\/or economic power (with these being the same thing in many societies) \n\nHowever, modern neo-fascists (and edgy conservatives) often complain about safe spaces, deplatforming, being fired, being banned from internet forums, ect for saying inflammatory and insulting things to those around them - they are complaining, by their statement, that their \"free speech\" is being infringed upon. By this, they evidently are referring to a *positive* idea of free speech, not the more conventionally conceived *negative* free speech. They are demanding that everyone be required to listen to them, and that they suffer no rebuke -not even in the form of responding free speech, such as a counter-protest in response to a rally- for doing so in return. This rhetoric, while something of an interesting development (I believe, though am not certain, that it is fairly recent) is not of much interest to this over-all explanation of anarchist thought - however, it must be brought up to explain why certain aspects of \"free speech\" are difficult to discuss amongst those not already in the thick of things. \n\nHowever, negating any real potential for *citizens\/subjects* of a state, especially a democratic state, is that speech of many, most, or perhaps all sorts is a political act. And, within the context of state, especially a democratic state, a political act is a violent act. If someone is beginning to attempt to initiate violent acts against you or those you care about, you can't allow such attempts to go unchallenged. Therefore, if someone says that they will pursue state office, assist others to pursue state office, or organize a paramilitary group to ultimately initiate violence against you, this is a threat of physical harm that you can and must respond to by any means necessary - including by using violence to disrupt their ability to public ally recruit and organize. \n\nWith that pre-amble (yes, a mere pre-amble) completed, I can actually discuss your comments that started this discussion: i.e., the idea that the extra-judicial killing of a dictator or genocider, or perhaps a potential dictator or potential genocider, is an infringement upon free speech. Free speech does not exist and is a non-sensical concept, and someone using state power to harm you or those around you is an initiation of physical aggression that should be met with all force necessary.\n\nAlso, change your flair, you fucking idiot child. You're not a libertarian socialist, you're a liberal using an edgy, radical aesthetic. \n","created_utc":1529349529,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

In this way, anarchism finds itself at odds with many schools of Marxist thought and practice.\n\nMyself, I fall into the former camp.

He wants *all* people to better themselves. He's driven by helping everyone. His philosophy is very inclusive. The \"test\" to get into the project mayhem collective isn't meant to be exclusive or hard to figure out. He wants people to pass, and he has people go out and drop hints to anyone that's struggling.\n\nHis intense desire to help everyone is shown by the absurd scene where he pulls a gun on a gas station cashier, takes him out back, and asks him what he really wanted to do with his life. The guys says \"veterinarian\", and Tyler says if you're not on your way to becoming a veterinarian by the time I come back in a few months, I will kill you. The poor guy is crying and scared shitless. But after they leave, the main character (unnamed) says that wasn't cool, and Tyler says \"tommorow will be the best day of his life.\"\n\nThis scene really shows his character well. He really does care about everyone, it's not darwinistic at all. He's willing to go to absurd extremes to help everyone to succeed. But he throws normal concepts of morality out the window while doing so, and that's what makes his character so interesting. You can't help but wonder whether or not he really made that gas station clerk's life a bit better.\n\nAnyway, His goal is to help as many people as possible, and I think that even though he appears to be nihilistic on the surface because of his extremely violent methods, he's actually doing it for altruistic reasons.","created_utc":1529384476,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I mostly avoided the main UU bureaucracy and hierarchy and instead organize autonomously within it.  \n  \nOne good thing I've seen practiced at a UU church is providing meals to houseless folks every Saturday. Also I've seen spaces created for immigrant organizing in UU churches, and also a room reserved for religious minorities who could not afford a full-on temple but instead borrow a room once a week (e.g. Sufi folks). Also community gardens, space permitting. One of the best programs UU's do is \"OWL\" (Our Whole Lives) comprehensive sex ed, those programs are very important, maybe your spot already has one but it's always good to encourage more.  \n  \nThe main thing with UU's is most of them, in my experience, are lots of talk and feel-good buzzwords but rarely do radical stuff. The demographics are largely older, educated, white, and wealthy. Fundraising can be a good direction. I think a lot of younger folks would be interested in moving beyond symbolic protest and electioneering provided it is not an either\/or situation (i.e. don't bash liberals, just provide radical stuff and they will often partake).

That is the real conflict in the movie.\n\nThe more you re-watch fight club, the more you realize that Tyler Durden is actually a fascist. He's constructed a militant, male only club with no names that wears black military clothing. He sees woman as sex objects. In fact, Marla starts the movie as equal to jack the narrator. In the same boat, burnt out on society. Through out the film, Tyler de-humanizes her into a mere sex object for himself and his alter ego. It gets restated this is no accident by project mayhem and fight club itself are \"boys only\". This is very explicitly stated, repeatedly.\n\nFurther developing the character of motivations of the tyler\/narrator, you see that it is not poverty, not class status, that drives this. Tyler\/Narrator are &amp;#37;100 mainstream white Americans that came from an upstanding background. There is literally no class, race, gender, etc.. conflict. The movie came out shortly before 9\/11, but you could obviously see there where in reality a great many conflicts in the US. Its just he's either oblivious or doesn't care. Not only is he a white mainstream rich american yuppie, but he's oblivious to everyone else.\n\nFight club has no objective but glorifying casual male violence. Not merely a boxing club, but encourages people to start fights in public, for the sake of well, fighting in public. His appeal is not against class or hierarchy, but the boring tame \"anti-maleness\" of modern society and the lack of a great war or other conflict to fight and define him in. \n\nHis specific beef seems to be against money lending corporations(oh where does this sound familiar from), and overall appears to be more third position anti-capitalist, then legitimately socialist\/anarchist.\n\nThe Narrator is counterpoint to Tyler. In the end he shoots himself in the mouth to realize he doesn't need Tyler, doesn't need facism, and doesn't need his own debased fantasy on masculinity to be a man to win over Marla.\n\nRorschach, is a very real Charles Bukowksi-esque shade of grey.","created_utc":1529392238,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Intellectual1998","body":"The primary principle of Anarchism, is the challenge and test of authority to prove its legitimacy, and the dismantling of those structures and positions of authority if they fail to meet that challenge. If I\u2019m walking with my child on a side walk, and he\/she begins to run into a busy road and I grab them  and pull them back... well that\u2019s a very physical exercise of authority. But if I was challenged, someone said \u201cWhy did you put your hands on that child\u201d I could reasonably explain and prove that the child\u2019s life was in danger and so I had to exercise authority or they\u2019d have been killed. That is legitimate authority, you have to prove your legitimacy and it\u2019s the responsibility of the perpetrator to prove it. It should be the same for every person, weather you are a police officer, a judge, a congressmen, a father, a manager, or any position or structure of power and authority... authority is rarely legitimate. There are other ways to legitimize authority, like through a fair democratic vote. This principle encompasses many forms of anarchism (excluding anarcho cap), but also many movements which are not usually defined as being anarchist. Like the civil rights movement, the feminist movements, the gay rights movements, the labor movements of the 18th century and many, many others. Anarchism doesn\u2019t care if you are a \u201cliberal\u201d or a \u201cconservative\u201d it cares if you wield illegitimate authority.\n\nNoam Chomsky has some brilliant interviews and speeches about anarchism that are immensely helpful, typing \u201cChomsky on Anarchism\u201d into your YouTube search field will help you find them\n. \nA Peoples History of the United States by Howard Zinn is also an invaluable resource if you want to understand these principles through history.

I think:\n1. capitalism turns people into dollar signs. Right now, in America, the american cancer society for one is more interested in treating cancer than preventing it in the first place. this is because they make money off the victims. Trump cares about keeping illegal immigrants out because they don't pay taxes, instead of worrying about their well-being and quality of life. capitalism takes the humanity away from humans if they're below the presidental or \"higher up\" level.\n\n2. capitalism only is good for the rich. people with a lot of money can get good healthcare, fun luxuries, and bail their children out of jail. simply because they have a lot of money. the poor family can barely afford food, has to work many minimum wage jobs because their skills aren't \"valuable\" to that society. it leaves the poor out to suffer and die because they're not fortunate enough to climb out of their hole. \n\na gift economy is leader-less and without capitalism. everyone takes or makes what they need, then give the excess to those in need. for instance, a family has a huge turkey for dinner. they can only eat part of it, so they give their leftovers to their neighbors. this good deed would encourage this neighbor to repay them not out of obligation, but out of kindness. this neighbor then mows the families' lawn in the summer one night. this encouragement of human good and charity removes \"rich\" and \"poor\", and instead fosters love and equality. \n\nShould someone want a fancy sports car, perhaps they make friends with a mechanic and learn to fix up cars and make their own. This man then gained the mechanic skill, and will later do good by their friend, perhaps by sharing the car with them.\n\nmoney doesn't help anyone. in the soceity we live in now, of course i want to get rich. i want to get rich to actually live comfortably and happily, and help others in need. this is the only good use of money in this capitalistic society, which is to get money and then help those that do not have it.","created_utc":1529435730,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Anarchists are not inherently left or right, as left vs right is the economic scale and authoritarian vs anarchist is the social scale. However, it seems that most anarchists fall into the left side of the economic scale because right tends to be more related to capitalism, which is in and of itself a system that creates and supports unfair hierarchies of authority. Libertarianism does not seem to be an anarchist ideology, as liberals tend to be nonviolent centrists.

Supporting politicians who are corrupt just like the liberals are doing?  \n\nThis is the definition of fascism:  \u00a0a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.\n\nThis element exists in America.  It has for a very long time.  But that's not your average conservative.  They just want to maintain traditions and yes, I know Hitler was a traditionalist, but there's a spectrum of conservatism and not all in fact most conservatives aren't hardcore believers in fascist behavior just like not all liberals are radical Marxists.\n\nI wouldn't be screaming about this if it wasn't for the fact that I've studied and lived among radicals from all walks of life and I know how dangerous these thoughts, which are being expressed on this subreddit can be.  If you think most conservatives are fascists and don't deserve to live or have a voice then you will create the very enemy you sought to eliminate and you will suffer and cause many innocent lives to suffer because you didn't think things through.

Instead we need to fight them politically and we need to engage with them in genuine intellectual discussion so we can get at the root of the problem and figure it out, so that both sides can feel okay with our policy directions.  \n\nBut sure, let's just say fuck it and kill all the conservatives.

Hegel, Herbert Mercuse, Alice Walker.  You name it.  But, of course, I'm also fascinated by other intellectuals who fall more into the science camp like Steven Pinker or James Gilligan.  Social science only has merit if it can incorporate how we literally function because all systems and individual behavior is heavily influenced by our biological makeup.  Doesn't mean things are deterministic, but to understand these big questions like the phenomenon of oppression we have to dig deeper than merely forming logical conclusions based on case studies.  \n\nNot to discount the social sciences.  I think there's a lot of valuable and credible information we can take away from these fields.  But, I also am not convinced that it will give us the whole picture.  I think the answer lies in the hard sciences and no that doesn't mean to say that we should be oppressive because some people have better genes or that higharchy and patriarchy are natural proclivities that manifest from our natural differences between men and women and therefore we should adhere to them.  Rather we need to de-construct these phenomenons that have been seen across time to better understand how we can avoid being oppressive to one another.  We can't avoid being oppressive unless we understand why we're oppressive.  But instead it's chalked up to it being an inherent flaw in our system or it's just simply one group or another who are purely motivated by hate and fear and that's it.  Really, dude?  Come on.  You know it's more than just a system or a group issue.  There's real biology and nuanced psychology that's taking place to justify acts of violence.\n\nAnd I think if we can develop and easy-to-underatnaf explanation for these things we can better mediate our differences because really at the end of the day most conservatives aren't motivated by hate.  They're motivated by order so if you can give them a well-defined reason as to why They're wrong that goes beyond the argument that it's inhumane, then you might just convince a conservative to not be so oppressive.

So instead, I have to try and understand what they're saying and why they think their ideas are better than mine, so I can take the golden nugget that exists within their ideas and merge it with my little nugget of truth to create a more powerful idea.\n\nAnd that's exactly how new and better ideas are formed.  I definitely believe that a new system will inevitably need to be adopted if we are to survive.  Is it anarchism?  I don't know.  I think some variations of that are in order, but again, I don't know and I'm not entirely sure anyone really knows, but if we set the intellectual discourse straight, we can begin to solve these issues instead of believing that the solution is to wipe out one group over the other.\n\nThere is hope for us, but we need to learn how to better engage with others who are different from us if we want to avoid the same catastrophe that our predecessors created for themselves.  This isn't a liberal or a conservative thing or even an anarchist thing.  It's a human thing.  If we go down the path we're going down now, we will kill our family and we'll have to live with that, and that's a very hard thing to live with.  I've hung around people who have killed before and its not something you can forget. ","created_utc":1529467102,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Conservatives just want to move on and keep everything as it is, but that's not right because there are major faults that we need to address, which do indeed propagate acts of oppression and injustice.  but Liberals want to change those facets that oppress us without realizing that those facets aren't inherent flaws in the system or groups of people....It's individuals.  Individuals are flawed.  Individuals are racists.  Individuals  are oppressive and these individuals exist everywhere in every political group.

{"author":"monsantobreath","body":"&gt;But instead it's chalked up to it being an inherent flaw in our system or it's just simply one group or another who are purely motivated by hate and fear and that's it. Really, dude? Come on. You know it's more than just a system or a group issue. There's real biology and nuanced psychology that's taking place to justify acts of violence.\n\nThe structure interacting with the individual is clearly part of the analysis, or else the criticism of power structure and how it shapes individuals and groups wouldn't be relevant to the left particular the libertarian end of the socialist pool. And frankly if you're looking for hard science Pinker's work is not where I'd begin given how shabby so much of his extrapolations are.\n\nTo pretend that leftists have no thought as to the psychology of individuals and the effects the system has on them is rather odd as that underpins a great deal, especially within radical feminist analysis. Portraying leftism as merely obsessed with a system separate from the individual is disingenuous.\n\n&gt;you might just convince a conservative to not be so oppressive\n\nArguing that oppression is a product of psychology to the extent that we can meaningfully alter oppressive systems without altering the system itself is rather far fetched but certainly appealing to liberal reformism who love the idea that there's power in the individual's ability to be a better person in revolutionizing the world. You can't convince oppressors to stop being oppressive if their entire social order is built on it. Its not an individual question. That's instead a feature of exploring how we reconstruct a society once we've extricated ourselves from the oppressive structures that ensure that regardless of how you feel or think that the material reality is people are going to be disempowered. In the end no measure of extending and radicalizing the former social norm of a _oblige noblesse_ could ever change the dynamics and structural inequality of a feudal land system. You don't convince nobles to be less oppressive, you simply end the entire structure of nobility and feudalism.\n\nLeftism is concerned with power and where it flows from. Psychology however relevant still has to be grounded in the appreciation of this. The psychology of where power flows from cannot be divorced from the material reality that concerns leftists and which seems to make liberals balk except when they want to talk about technocratic notions of quality of life, ie. enter Pinker and his ilk.","created_utc":1529468680,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

This action is dedicated to our dear comrade in jail; Sven.\n\nSomewhere in the Netherlands, in the darkest hours of the night, we gathered up near a chicken farm. Carefully moving forward, there were wild animals all around. Guided by their sounds and movement we approached our target. At the farm they probably saw us passing the bins with dead and decaying chickens and disappearing in the stables. Here, we were greeted by a view that could have been taken right out of a horror movie. Huge amounts of these intelligent birds all crammed into little cages, row upon row as far as the eye can see. Living in their own filth with metal bars all around them producing egg after egg. If hell exists, we entered it right now\u2026\n\nA cage-door opens while many eyes look terrified in our direction. Carefully the chicken (who we named Sven, although she is a girl ;-) ) is lifted out and she could feel the warmth of our bodies touching. For the first time in her life she is greeted with love, with a feeling that she t\u00f3\u00f3 matters. The chicken who we named Natasha came out of a different cage and she was met with a gentleness and love that she will have never thought was possible from a human being. it\u2019s all we can do for the others that we have to leave behind, give them a little bit more space to move around. Sorry girls, we wish we could have taken all of you. We will never forget you and we will grieve the day you die\u2026 May your rest and peace come soon and without pain.\n\nWhile we moved outside and let our 26 new friends taste the fresh air for the first time in their lives we can\u2019t help but think about this fucked up system that is destroying so many lives every day. All we can do is fight it as hard as we all can! More and more people are standing up to resist and we will be no exceptions. Our struggle goes on until every cage is empty and until every slaughterhouse has been closed down. So pardon us for smiling when their oppressive system comes crumbling down, we know that from the ashes we can build a new society based on equality and freedom; the aim is nothing less than a vegan society!\n\nSven and Natasha; stay strong during these times! Without you being who you are these girls would have never gotten away from their prison. They will live their lives in as much freedom as possible, with a lot of grass and mud to roam around on. We hope that Sven (the human one ;-) ) will get out of his cell as soon as possible and we call upon all people to show Sven all the support he can possibly get!\n\nFREE SVEN!\nFREE THE ANIMALS!\nUNTIL EVERY CAGE IS EMPTY!\n\n&gt;\u00a0https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/freesven\/\n\n","created_utc":1529496809,"score":7,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Awale-Ismail","body":"It doesn't really matter how *good* any given police force acts and seems. It's the very fundamentals of their institution that's the problem. When the chips are down, the cops aren't truly there to protect and serve the *common man;* they're there to maintain order. Maintain what *order?* The order of modern Capitalist societies... That's why they'll target the poor and disenfranchised for drug charges more than people who live in *upper class* neighborhoods. That's why they'll help in evicting some poor family that's having its lifeblood sucked away by some greedy landlord. That's why they'll sometimes violently disperse peaceful protesters who are disrupting the flow of the daily status quo in someway (i.e. badly hounding some big Capitalist establishment). Do they take down some serial killers, rapists and such? Sure, but that doesn't absolve them of what they stand for at their core. The police and the military are the arms and legs of any modern capitalist nation... If and when any sort of *revolution* strikes; they'll be the ones on the front lines for the state's side. They are always the enemy as such. \n\nAll that being said, it's not like all cops join to oppress people. I'm sure many joined their respective force genuinely believing they'd be helping society in some way, just as some poor sods actually join military forces like that of the US because they seriously think they're *defending Americans* by fooling around in Afghanistan or Iraq or wherever else. Much like many police officers, they don't truly see that they're being used as the foot-soldiers of a heinous hierarchical society.

It's not like we have the means of revolt or fighting back - we are forced into a dialectic to improve anything, since we are already disempowered.

Is it anarchism? I don't know.\n\nOne could even say anarchism is a descriptive state of humanity: we are all equals and only artificially placed into arbitrary hierarchies based on artificial constructs like inheritance, capital \/ private property, divine rights, etc. and then enforced through armed guards, police, etc. \n\n&gt;  I don't know. I think some variations of that are in order, but again, I don't know and I'm not entirely sure anyone really knows, but if we set the intellectual discourse straight, we can begin to solve these issues instead of believing that the solution is to wipe out one group over the other.\n\nNot sure anyone is suggesting wiping out one group over another. \n\nAnarchists sure hate cops since they represent the physical and violent force that enforces the arbitrary and unjust hierarchies we live in. The people behind the badge are comrades too. George Orwell was a policeman for a while, police in the Virginia Mine Wars helped the anarchists fight back the National Guard (and fellow police) to protect the miners against the company-hired guards. \n\nIt's not really about groups of people fighting for dominance - anarchists want a revolution to end hierarchy, all hierarchy. Not to start a new hierarchy (unlike Marx and his Tyranny of the Proletariat, in which he thought a temporary state was necessary where the proletariat would be in hierarchy above the rich). \n\nThe anarchists are not calling for wiping out one \"group\" - they are calling for equality and mutual aid. Self defense is necessary for that, since the police are aggressors against people attempting to engage in mutual aid - mostly because people think they own the land, the air, the rivers. Still, it seems your understanding of anarchism comes from a weird place... Maybe you could (in true dialectic form) talk about your experiences with anarchism and how you came to think the proposition was \"to wipe out one group over the other.\"\n\n\n&gt; There is hope for us\n\nThat's a bit bold. I guess we *must* hope, even if there isn't hope. \n\n&gt; but we need to learn how to better engage with others who are different from us if we want to avoid the same catastrophe that our predecessors created for themselves\n\nAnarchism is about the equality of people - of course differences must be accepted as a part of this - it's an inherently pluralistic philosophy. \n\nStill not sure where you're coming from... probably just that aggressive assholes who call themselves anarchists really just like to bitch about liberals and hate cops and get wrapped up more in the loathing than living according to anarchist principles of recognizing the inherent equal rights of man... \n\n&gt; It's a human thing. If we go down the path we're going down now, we will kill our family and we'll have to live with that\n\nI think [we've already killed so much family](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/thetwo-way\/2018\/04\/19\/604031141\/new-study-says-ancient-humans-hunted-big-mammals-to-extinction)\n\n&gt;  I've hung around people who have killed before and its not something you can forget.\n\nYeah, killing is pretty bad. Not even Gelderloos's *How Non-Violence Protects the State* suggests we should just go around killing cops. It requires a populace uprising before something like revolution is possible - anarchists don't support [vanguardism](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vanguardism). \n","created_utc":1529520818,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Now communists were to join with moderate socialist and liberal groups in \u201cpopular fronts\u201d against fascism. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/Third-International\n\nIt was also in 1935 that the Jews lost their citisenship. Furthermore USA had their own problems with segregated society\n\n&gt;The Nuremberg laws, enacted in 1935, stripped the Jews of their citizenship and made it a crime for Jews to have sexual intercourse with Germans. Jews were excluded from many jobs and government positions, and they were not allowed to ride on street cars or sit on park benches reserved for Aryans. The rest of the world, particularly Americans, ignored these early warnings; at that time America was a segregated country with institutionalized racism, and there were many restricted neighborhoods where Jews were not allowed to buy a home. American universities had quotas for Jewish students and numerous clubs and organizations did not allow Jews as members. While the Nazi racists were encouraging 300,000 Jews to leave Germany in the 1930ies, the American government was handing a one-way ticket to Mexico to 500,000 Mexican immigrants and Mexican-American citizens during the same time period.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.scrapbookpages.com\/Sachsenhausen\/introduction.html\n\nSo you could say in 1935 supporting Nazism over USA (if u take USA to be an example of capitalism) was not big a deal cause they were both bad.","created_utc":1529526444,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

All the while, border patrol had their surveillance on me. Vans would drive by me with side doors open and them just staring at me as they slowly drove by. They have that shit on lockdown. I also was forced to pull over and had a drug dog \"hit\" on my car. I had no drugs at all, but they searched all through my vehicle while interrogating me. They had no right to search me, but, technically, they did as I was within 100 miles of the border. It's a lawless area.\n\n&gt; I trekked a good ways out there and could just feel the misery these immigrants have to go through. I couldn't imagine trekking through that desert without a pack mule... You could just feel this negative energy in the air out there. Just a pure feeling of death.\n\n&gt; The fucked up thing is border patrol wants immigrants to cross through the desert. They know many will die, but they want that. They see the desert as a natural deterrent and, thus, do not patrol the border directly in the desert. What they do instead is have the border on the edges of the desert on lock down. Secure as all hell. This kinda herds the immigrants into the desert. There, many will die. Others will be so physically and mentally exhausted that they are easy to catch and spot. It's more economically efficient for border patrol this way.","created_utc":1529626535,"score":15,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

They were so thoroughly emasculated by the stereotype that they seemed harmless and pathetic, but frankly that's probably why it's metastasized into the current conception. Systems of oppression are parasitic hierarchies that turn their victims into their champions.\n\nGrognards were just tabletop gamers yeah, but they were such aggressive gatekeepers of the hobby, especially before it became more male by design, that the term always had a bit of an acidic aftertaste.\n\nI think once we survive the sugar high of nostalgia we're in now, the emergence of the 80s nerd subculture may get a deconstruction along the same lines that modern nerd culture has started to. There's a rich history there, and a chilling story of a bunch of social nobodies quickly reorganizing their inherited white patriarchy as soon as there was social capital to fight for.\n\nIt's not uniform though. It's just super unfortunate how uniformly the systems were adopted. Within our lifetime nerds went from jokes to the masters of mankind, to use Adam Smith. But even before that, we saw a lot of really terrible deplatforming of minority creators, let alone fans and representatives.\n\nThe essential nature of nerd culture is how independently it operates from real culture. The was the appeal. It was a parallel validation scheme with a bedrock suffused with victim hood narratives, appeals to meritocracy over popularity, and fantasies.\n\nIt's also innately commodofiable because it's escapist consumption focused.\n\nIt's fine when you're just the kids from Stranger Things, but it's a stew that presents people with hero narratives and worlds full of white male author surrogates where merit triumphs.\n\nEven stuff that I love like The Last Starfighter is unfortunately prepping some poor kid to accept some of the competitive hero savior narrative that fascists use to attract kids feeling alienated from their societies, families, communities, and labor.\n\nEnemy Mine is a good companion piece to that though.

The injunction, Cain continued, \"requires that individual to refrain from coming onto any and all Extraction property or sites in the state of Colorado going forward.\"\n\nCullen Lobe, 23, was arrested on March 8 and charged with misdemeanor trespassing after he locked himself to a bulldozer at the Extraction Oil &amp; Gas site in the area of U.S. 34 and E. 20th Street using a PVC lock box. Members of an environmental organization advocacy group that disagrees with oil and gas development near the school looked on. Extraction Oil and Gas filed a civil lawsuit, naming Lobe and four others as defendants in the case.\n\nLobe told Denver Channel 7 that he had been involved in previous protests at the site near Bella Romero Academy, but felt their actions were falling on deaf ears, which is why he locked himself to Extraction's construction equipment.\"\n\nHe also told the Denver TV station that he expected there would be consequences for his actions, but he didn't think Extraction would sue him over the protest.\n\nJason Flores-Williams, Lobe's attorney, said Thursday by phone that the plea agreement for the civil suit was the outcome he and his client had hoped for. \"First off, we didn't have to use any more of the court's time; secondly, we protected the First Amendment concerns of the case by not disclosing communication records; and thirdly, it takes a young man concerned about the world and puts him back where he can return to his studies and follow new directions.\"\n\nAlthough the civil case is settled, the criminal case is still going forward, Flores-Williams said, but a resolution is pending.\n\n\"It will probably end with community service or something like that,\" he added.\n\n\n","created_utc":1529670634,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"nultrasol","body":"So, I went through your prior comments, and I see you\u2019re not American. So, I\u2019ll explain the best I can.\n\nWhiteness was only developed as a means of oppression. When racism became a social construct, it only came into existence as a means of power dynamics. Being proud of ones race was only rooted in oppression. There were no people proud of being white prior to racism as a construct. Being proud of being white only emerged as a racial construct to oppress non-whites.\n\nSo: pride in being non-white is being proud of a racial category that\u2019s currently and historically oppressed. Pride in being white, at its origins, was always about oppression and never being white. You can be proud of your cultural background, but most white Americans don\u2019t have a culture beyond white America.\n\nWhiteness only originated as a tool of oppression.\n\nAs a white person, you shouldn\u2019t need to be worried about being proud of your skin color because the only white pride was used to be oppressive. White people should be critical of their race and not seek any pride in it. To be honest, I feel like white people who aren\u2019t comfortable with identifying white as a privilege and source of oppression are pretty fragile with low self esteem.\n\nI\u2019m white and even the notion of somehow defending or being defensive or finding pride is ridiculous. I\u2019m white because my non-white ancestors pushed for us to assimilate and destroy what cultures they had to be accepted. So here I am with no attachments to said culture even though I\u2019m somehow raised in it. Any criticisms of it, I accept, and continue forward. Any person I\u2019ve seen try to be defensive or being like being white is a bad thing is like... just stop. The insecurity is clear as day.\n\nThis is in the American context, which shaped a lot of racism within the rest of the world. \n\nBeing proud of being white is like being proud of being born into wealth or being proud to be born a man. Why? The identity has only existed for a long time now as an identity of oppression. Or proud of being straight. Being proud of something used as a status quo to oppress others is.. yeah hell no.

{"author":"HaLoGuY007","body":"&gt; Right-wing extremists are making their presence felt in mainstream American politics. Whether they are running for high-profile offices themselves, or aligning themselves with candidates in races around the country, members of the extremist right \u2013 and their racist, anti-Semitic views \u2013 are experiencing more exposure today than at any time in recent history.\n&gt; \n&gt; While extremists\u2019 involvement in politics is not new, the country\u2019s major political parties have historically kept fringe candidates and their ideologies at arm\u2019s length.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Holocaust Denial**\n&gt; \n&gt; In one case, the Holocaust denier himself is running for office. In Illinois, former American Nazi Party head Arthur Jones will be the Republican nominee for US Representative for the state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District after running unopposed in the primary. The vocal white supremacist and Holocaust denier will face incumbent Representative Dan Lipinski in the general election.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jones and his wife are founding (and possibly sole) members of the neo-Nazi America First Committee, which operates under the Nationalist Front umbrella. He often attends events organized by the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement (NSM), including the April 2017 rally in Pikeville, Kentucky.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jones has repeatedly run for office, always unsuccessfully, since the 1970s.\n&gt; \n&gt; While few believe Jones has any chance of winning the 3rd, where voters have elected a Democrat in 24 of the last 25 Congressional races, as a major-party candidate for a statewide seat, Jones will have a significant platform for his hateful views. The candidate\u2019s website pairs \u201cAmerica First\u201d language with outright Holocaust denial, including a \u201cHolocaust Racket\u201d diatribe that blames \u201cOrganized World Jewry\u201d for perpetrating \u201cthe biggest, blackest lie in history.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Responding to Jones\u2019s candidacy, Tim Schneider, chairman of the Illinois Republican Party, issued the following statement: \u201cThe Illinois Republican Party and our country have no place for Nazis like Arthur Jones. We strongly oppose his racist views and his candidacy for any public office, including the 3rd Congressional District.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; In California\u2019s 11th congressional district, Republican and virulently anti-Israel conspiracy theorist John Fitzgerald won enough votes in the state's June primary to advance to the general election. CA-11, which encompasses a swath of the East Bay, has elected a Democrat to its House seat in the last three elections. Fitzgerald, a small business owner and perennial (unsuccessful) candidate for this seat, is a 9\/11 conspiracy theorist who often \u201cquestions\u201d facts about the Holocaust and defends Holocaust deniers. Staunchly anti-Israel, Fitzgerald also makes frequent (false) references to Jewish Americans having \u201cdual citizenship\u201d with Israel, which is a common anti-Semitic trope. He promulgates some of the most common right-wing conspiracy theories about chem trails, the Federal Reserve, internment camps, vaccines and GMOs, and believes that Planned Parenthood is working in concert with the United Nations to \u201csexualize\u201d the nation\u2019s public school children.\n&gt; \n&gt; In other cases, major party elected officials are providing Holocaust deniers a public platform (and public validation).\n&gt; \n&gt; In October 2017, U.S. Representative Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) hosted Holocaust denier Chuck Johnson at a meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Johnson has questioned the number of Jewish victims of the Holocaust, and has theorized that the Auschwitz concentration camp and gas chambers never existed.\n&gt; \n&gt; In February 2018, U.S. Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL) welcomed Johnson as his guest at the State of the Union address. Even after he was provided with background materials on Johnson, Gaetz declined to rescind his invitation.\n&gt; \n&gt; **Anti-Semitic Media Outlets**\n&gt; \n&gt; Anti-Semitic media outlets are also getting in on the act, providing controversial candidates with potentially valuable publicity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mississippi state senator Chris McDaniel made a January 2018 appearance on Ian Trottier\u2019s radio program, ostensibly to discuss his new book. Trottier is a known anti-Semite and enthusiastic conspiracy theorist, who believes 9\/11 may have been perpetrated by the \u201cWorld Zionist Organization.\u201d McDaniel has denied that he knew anything about Trottier\u2019s beliefs or previous statements. This is not McDaniel\u2019s first brush with extremist ideology; he spoke at a 2013 neo-Confederate event and retweeted a white supremacist\u2019s message in 2014.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Arizona, U.S. Senate candidate and former Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio has given five interviews since 2014 to the American Free Press, a longstanding white supremacist, anti-Semitic \u201cnews\u201d website founded by Holocaust denier Willis Carto.\n&gt; \n&gt; When a reporter from the Arizona Republic asked about the interviews, Arpaio, who was convicted of criminal contempt (and later controversially pardoned by President Trump) for defying an order to stop racially profiling Latinos, asked, \"What am I supposed to do? Investigate every media outlet to see what stories they write?\" Later, he released the following statement: \u201cIt was brought to my attention I gave interview to publication that supports antisemitism; I was unaware and don't support that view point\u201d (sic).\n&gt; \n&gt; Back in 2006, Lou Barletta, then-mayor of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, and current U.S. Senate candidate (R-PA), granted an interview with the American Free Press, promoting his hardline anti-immigration policies. Barletta also headlined a 2007 rally alongside Paul Topete, a musician known for promoting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.\n&gt; \n&gt; **White Supremacist &amp; Anti-Semitic Bile**\n&gt; \n&gt; Meanwhile, Paul Nehlen, a Wisconsin Republican who hopes to unseat House Speaker Paul Ryan, is increasingly touting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and unapologetically racist views from his official Twitter account and on white supremacist podcasts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nehlen, a businessman with no political experience, continues to post overtly anti-Semitic, racist and anti-immigrant messages, many of which have been promoted widely by accounts linked to alt righters and other white supremacists, including Richard Spencer and David Duke.\n&gt; \n&gt; In June, a video surfaced of Corey Stewart, Virginia's GOP candidate for U.S. Senate, referring to Nehlen as one of his \u201cpersonal heroes\" at a political event in February 2017.  In a video obtained by CNN, Stewart praised Nehlen again in November 2017, after Nehlen had made his anti-Semitic, white supremacist positions public. In the exchange, Stewart expresses support for Nehlen\u2019s candidacy and refers to him as a \u201creal conservative.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; Stewart, who is running for Democrat Tim Kaine's seat after an unsuccessful 2017 bid for governor, was an outspoken supporter of the white supremacist Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, and has appeared publicly several times with its local organizer, Jason Kessler. A recent Stewart campaign email praised \u201cvolunteer of the week\u201d Ian MacDonald, whose Facebook page includes memes of American Nazi Party founder George Lincoln Rockwell.\n&gt; \n&gt; In California, outspoken anti-Semite and Republican Patrick Little hoped to challenge Democrat Dianne Feinstein for her U.S. Senate seat, but won just 1.4 percent of the vote (or about 61,000 votes) in the state's June 5 party-blind primary. The day after the primary, Little took to social media to demand a recount, claiming that he'd come in first or second, but that votes were being suppressed by \"Jewish supremacists and Zionists.\" \n&gt; \n&gt; Little, who attended the 2017 Unite the Right white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and told Newsweek he \"admires\" Adolf Hitler, has been publicly denounced by the California Republican Party. \n&gt; \n&gt; Little\u2019s Gab (social media) account is littered with anti-Semitic comments, including his oft-repeated pledge to help create a government \u201cfree from Jews.\u201d\n&gt; \n&gt; In a local Tennessee race, Keith Alexander, who served on the board of the white supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens (CCC) and has co-hosted the right-wing extremist radio show \u201cThe Political Cesspool,\u201d was on the ballot May 1 as the Republican candidate for Shelby County Assessor. (Alexander lost the primary, earning 38 percent of the vote).  A member of the local GOP denounced Alexander, who told the Commercial Appeal newspaper, \"I don't believe in racism or white nationalism or any of those things. OK? ...The idea of having any racially homogeneous nation, that ship has sailed.'' \n&gt; \n&gt; Alexander claims he\u2019s no longer associated with the CCC, which he characterized as \"probably too extreme,\" or with his former \u201cCesspool\u201d co-host, the well-known white supremacist and anti-Semite James Edwards. Alexander last co-hosted the show on December 30, 2017, according to the Commercial Appeal.\n&gt; \n&gt; In June, white supremacist activist and Identity Evropa member James Orien Allsup went unchallenged in his campaign to become a Whitman County (Washington) Republican Precinct Committee Officer. The local GOP immediately denounced Allsup and are reportedly examining their bylaws for a way to remove him from the position. \n&gt; \n&gt; Allsup is best known for his far-right podcasts and as the former president of the College Republican chapter at Washington State University. In March 2018, Allsup spoke at Identity Evropa\u2019s national conference in Tennessee. In 2017, he participated in the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n&gt; \n","created_utc":1529681323,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"russinista","body":"Thank you for taking the time to actually reply in a way that explains things a bit more. I will reread your post in the coming days to better try to understand, here are some quick thoughts to try and get another reply from you or others to get as much information as possible about this wow it's fresh. \n\n (I was honestly baffled by the dismissal and non-response it got in this sub as anti-fascism and anti-racism seem to be common topics) \n\n&gt;So, I went through your prior comments, and I see you\u2019re not American. So, I\u2019ll explain the best I can.\n\nThank you, I forget how US-centric reddit is sometimes. (I assume you mean USA when you write America.)\n\n&gt;Whiteness was only developed as a means of oppression. When racism became a social construct, it only came into existence as a means of power dynamics. Being proud of ones race was only rooted in oppression. There were no people proud of being white prior to racism as a construct. Being proud of being white only emerged as a racial construct to oppress non-whites.\n&gt;\n&gt;So: pride in being non-white is being proud of a racial category that\u2019s currently and historically oppressed. Pride in being white, at its origins, was always about oppression and never being white. You can be proud of your cultural background, but most white Americans don\u2019t have a culture beyond white America.\n\nThese are great points, and I guess I can not fully understand how lacking in culture white US:ers are.\n\n&gt;Whiteness only originated as a tool of oppression.\n&gt;\n&gt;As a white person, you shouldn\u2019t need to be worried about being proud of your skin color because the only white pride was used to be oppressive. White people should be critical of their race and not seek any pride in it. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to find here is a way to be white, critical of racism but not go into self-loathing. I think it's dishonest to not aknowledge that I'm white, that that has a certain meaning in this point in history that I don't want that.\n\n&gt; To be honest, I feel like white people who aren\u2019t comfortable with identifying white as a privilege and source of oppression are pretty fragile with low self esteem.\n\nI agree with you here, and I want to talk about taking the next step as a white person. \n\nI'm trying to draw parallels to the feminist movement and how it in some places has evolved to a place where we now can talk about 'yes, men are a privileged group, that has to stop. This does not mean that men should use their privelige to save women, there are other more reasonable ways to be allies. We can also start talking about how men are mistreated and how that is harmful to men and helps to uphold the opression of women'\n\n&gt;I\u2019m white and even the notion of somehow defending or being defensive or finding pride is ridiculous.\n\nI guess this is an important point, I'm in no way wanting to defend whiteness or anything about how white people invented racism or is upholding racism today. To me that has nothing to do with the kind of pride I'm trying to talk about, but maybe I'm trying to find a concept that is impossible to find. \n\n&gt; I\u2019m white because my non-white ancestors pushed for us to assimilate and destroy what cultures they had to be accepted. So here I am with no attachments to said culture even though I\u2019m somehow raised in it. Any criticisms of it, I accept, and continue forward. Any person I\u2019ve seen try to be defensive or being like being white is a bad thing is like... just stop. The insecurity is clear as day.\n&gt;\n&gt;This is in the American context, which shaped a lot of racism within the rest of the world. \n\nWell, I'm not so sure about that, I'd say that European countries had a big hand in this too. Both as the originators of todays racism back in the colonial era and later on with the development of phrenology, crainometry, etc\n\n&gt;Being proud of being white is like being proud of being born into wealth or being proud to be born a man. Why? The identity has only existed for a long time now as an identity of oppression. Or proud of being straight. Being proud of something used as a status quo to oppress others is.. yeah hell no. \n\nI guess I'll have to ponder and talk about this more, because I don't fully understand how I can be 'not proud' of myself as (among other things a white man) in a way that does not include negative sentiments towards myself.\n\nI think I maybe tie dignity to pride in some way that is confusing for me.\n\n(Also, English is not my best language and I'm not an US:er so ofc some nuances and cultural meanings messes things up)","created_utc":1529692583,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"nultrasol","body":"That\u2019s what I figured, as to language and culture. I would\u2019ve jumped on you otherwise, but I figured there was huge cultural and language differences in how we understand this.\n\nI think it\u2019s important to have pride in you as a person, but you don\u2019t need to have to have pride in identities that are rooted in oppression. I can be proud, I can be proud of my beliefs, and who I am as a person. I don\u2019t find pride in my identities because I came from a position where either the identity was oppressive or simply that isn\u2019t a source of pride for me. \n\nI think that\u2019s a vital part is a lot of folks take shit personally. \n\nI\u2019ll use a case in point:\n\nI grew up pretty poor. I managed to push myself in a way that I\u2019m now the lower end of middle class, I\u2019m the only kid from my family generation to have gone to college, and I\u2019m living decently.\n\nI\u2019m not proud of the money, I\u2019m not proud of how I got here, and in many ways, even though I still live in a poor household and I provide for members in said household, I am a part of the racial aspect of gentrification because I can\u2019t afford to live in a lot of places.\n\nIf someone identifies me as a gentrifier, I\u2019m not going to get defensive or into the analysis. I accept their critique and I do my best to do good work and survive and be as radical as I can.\n\nI\u2019m proud that I don\u2019t struggle like I use to, I don\u2019t struggle like my family has, and I can provide for those in need, but that\u2019s where I draw the line in my pride. I\u2019m not proud of my family or my community I was raised in or much of my identity. I\u2019m proud of me as a whole and I leave it at that. \n\nIf I was to emphasize I\u2019m proud to have moved classes, I\u2019m proud of my racial background, I\u2019m proud to be in a position of financial leverage, I\u2019m proud to have moved on up academically, etc.. I\u2019m expressing pride in power structures I fundamentally disagree. I\u2019m proud I got through college cause it was a struggle, but I\u2019m not proud to be a college graduate as a status symbol. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of nuance and understanding on that.\n\nSo in the US, we have groups called SURJ. They\u2019re basically white people who work on trying to be better allies while critiquing themselves. Each chapter is different, there\u2019s good ones and terrible ones. But it\u2019s the notion of simply accepting that whiteness as a construct is an oppressive, privileged identity, and how that can be used as a way to weaponize its inherent power in fighting racism as an ally or by utility of non-white communities. This is best done by asking what the community needs and providing for it. ","created_utc":1529693655,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Western Europeans and Americans largely developed race as we know it as a form of oppression and most Americans don\u2019t even know full well how race in particular developed.\n\nWhen Americans were enslaving Africans, it was okay on the basis they weren\u2019t Christian. When slaves became Christian, Americans needed a new excuse. Racism basically began to develop out of that and what we know as the white identity emerged from looking for an excuse to keep people enslaved. \n\nIf you google, there\u2019s a poem called the White Man\u2019s Burden. It\u2019s peak example of how white Americans saw themselves. That white men, being superior, had the \u201cburden\u201d of authority and power to argue for colonialism. This wasn\u2019t a bastardization of the white identity rather this was a direct implication of being white as a social construct. \n\nKipling wasnt even American and wrote the poem, read aloud and used in an argument to colonize the Philippines.\n\nIn Latin America, they built an entire caste system on being white, and if you were mixed or mostly or all white (by their weird standards) you had more privileges.\n\nNot at any point historically has whiteness not been about oppression which is important to understand.

{"author":"gnomegorsky","body":"To use the Supreme Court as a moral righteousness is an extremely flawed argument and a crutch for poor intellectual thinking. The Supreme Court has supported the oppression of black people, of women, or gay people, and other people institutionally vulnerable in our society. The Supreme Court continues to support unjust laws while the government, to witching the Supreme Court is a part, consistently violates the declaration of human rights set forth by the United Nations. But either way, even if the white male cop who killed a little kid while he was running away is legally right, is it morally, ethically? Now most people would call a man filled with torture instruments and a gun killing a kid running away in fear a coward, a wimp, pathetic. We will withhold such reservations. What we know is that anyone who would discharge their weapon at a kid running away is far from righteous, and lacks any form of empathy and compassion towards fellow humans. As this situation continues, we will find out, I am confident, that this cop, who I suspect is a white supremacist who enjoys lynching black peoples (I suspect) will Be found to be a violator of human rights, and just another cop who murdered an unarmed black person. As for you, we know what you are, we know whose side you\u2019re on, and it\u2019s the wrong side of history. Good luck with that.\n\nTo your last point about unarmed people getting shot, Mike Brown comes to mind immediately. Also Charles Kinsey, a therapist to an autistic kid who kept his hands up and was still shot. And these are not isolated incidences. The black community has been complaining about this for decades. Of course, I also assume from your previous comments, that you would discretos this community in support of authority, to which you seem to hold a strong liking to.\n\nThe police in the United States do not police actual crime, they police the poor. If you look at 90% of all killings and financial loss, this is committed but the political and economic elite. Street crime accounts for only about 10% of killings and financial loss in our society. Yet, the policial and economic elite are not policed and often ignored in criminology classes across the US. So, police, and the institution of law enforcement largely ignored 90% of the crimes in our society while targeting the small percentage of people that commit street crime. While the numbers you conjure are questionable, these numbers are right on. Again, we know whose side you\u2019re on. You support the dominant society attacking those people of color that commit far less violent crime and financial theft than the white, political and economic elite that destroy the lives of tens of thousands of Americans. In every society, once the empire faces decline, hardcore, radicals supporters of hypocrisy and establishment rise to power.

{"author":"GCAlex","body":"You have to be trolling (White supremacist, enjoys lynching blacks people, torture instruments). But I\u2019ll play along. \n\nI NEVER stated anything about the morality of the officer\u2019s decision. I spoke solely from the legal aspect. We can discuss morality, and I think it could be a very interesting conversation, but when judging the actions of a police officer acting in the performance of their duties it\u2019s important to discuss both sides, the moral and the legal. The problem is that  NO ONE is discussing the legal side, everyone is speaking about morality and feelings. The police HAVE to be able to act based on legal precedent, that gives them the ability to act and respond decisively when it\u2019s needed. Was deadly force needed in this case? Based on the facts that we know now (e.g., the guns were in the car), no. But the officer could not have known that at the time, but he had a reasonable belief that they had guns on their person as they ran. That covers the legal aspect. Morally speaking, this is a much more difficult question to answer. Have fleeing criminals hurt innocent bystanders in the past? Absolutely. Would that have happened here? Probably not, but how could the officer have known that at the time? Police officers are there to protect the community at large, and I\u2019m willing to bet that is what the officer was thinking when he shot Antwon: he had a person fleeing from a car that was strongly suspected (based on the bullet holes and matching vehicle description) as being involved in a drive-by shooting 15 mins prior; it is not unreasonable to think that he may still have a gun on his person and may cause harm to more people in the impending chase. \n\nHow are the numbers that I posted \u201cquestionable?\u201d The statistics are the statistics. Also, Michael Brown DID NOT have his hands up when he was shot; that lie has been debunked by African American witnesses of the shooting. On the other hand, Charles Kinsey was a HERO who was trying to help out a person in need and definitely SHOULD NOT have been shot. But that situation is different that what I was talking about, and you know it just as well as I do...he was shot because the officer missed his target. The officer was (wrongfully), trying to protect Kinsey from the \u201csuspect\u201d (who we later learned...and who Kinsey was trying to explain to police at the time, has Autism) and missed. But, just so we\u2019re clear, the Hispanic police officer didn\u2019t intentionally shoot the unarmed black man in this instance, he 1) made the wrong decision to shoot, and 2) missed his intended target. The officer has been charged with attempted manslaughter and negligence, however I cannot find results of the case yet. At a minimum, I think he should be found guilty of something, attempted manslaughter might fit, but I don\u2019t know enough of the circumstances to decide. Side note, all of the videos of the shooting that I can find don\u2019t show the actual shooting, but only the beginning (with him laying on the ground with his hands up, trying to explain the situation to the police) and then the aftermath of the shooting. \n\nYour statement that POC commit far fewer violent crimes than white people are false. The FBI UCR is very clear on this point, not only per capita, but just outright numbers, POC commit more violent crime than white people do. \n\nBTW, your statement that you suspect the cop is a white supremacist who enjoys lynching black people is a pretty vile thing to say about someone that you literally know zero about. You have immediately judged his character based on an incident that appears to be legally justified and that some could argue is morally justified in order to protect the public from a fleeing violent actor. I\u2019m sure that you believe that my position is vile as well, but the difference is that at least I have supported my position with facts.

{"author":"JackONhs","body":"I know this isn't going to be a popular opinion here, but I'm going to say it regardless. I'm strongly against cops using deadly force when not needed. I am strongly against the shooting of animals when not justified. However, saying he would have been just fine if that dog did attack him is just being ignorent. \n\nDogs can be dangerous. They can kill people, and very quickly at that. Us human beings have this thing called a throat, and if at any point something sharp is to enter it, such as a dogs teeth, we very much can die. Even a dog this size could knock a man over and get at his throat. \n\nI have a hard time trying to figure out what I would have had done differently here. There was a man who was sucidal, he obviously needed help. Taking away the firearm in the house for the family's safety also sounds like the right call. Where things went wrong was when the dog surprised the officer. Yes, there is a solid chance this dog wouldn't cause major harm. And yes, shooting a dog and near children is obviously something we would all rather not have happen. Ever. But the fact remains that the officer was in danger. This wasn't some lap dog growling, or a family pet saying hello. In this moment that is a large animal with a lot of teeth lunging at you. \n\nWas shooting the right call? Almost definitely not. There was an unsafe backdrop, and doing so harmed an innocent child. However this man had about a quarter second to react. The dog went from 1 to 100 very suddenly. If there was time to think, then this would have been absolutely unforgivable. But there wasn't. This was human error. And human error that I believe anyone could make in this situation. \n\nI think what the officer did was wrong, but reasonable. I don't think there should be punishment for what happened. An investigation and additional training, maybe. My issue here isn't with what this cop did. Its with what we let happen to society where this can happen again. \n\nThe times we could have avert this from happening safely where way before the officer was attacked. But mental health care could have stopped this situation from reaching the point of someone being a danger to there own life. Or better yet, we could live in a society where the need for owning a gun for home defense wasn't a thing. There are plenty of places where the government didn't actively try to screw the lives of its citizens. But not this one. I'm gorwing tired of people always blaming cops when something horrible like this happens. Fuck that guy, he's just trying to do what he thinks is right, even if he is wrong. He's not the one we should be angry at. Its the people who built countries where cops are the bad guys that I feel like we should hate. The people who took kind hearted men and women and warped them into weapons to keep themselves in power. The people who could care less about a human life if it put more money in there pockets. \n\nBut no, it's the cops fault we all cry. And so we band together and say fuck all cops, we chose the smallest fucking hill for a movement to die on.

{"author":"Kill_Billionaires","body":"I'd just like to share some recent strike action and organizing that's been happening in Ireland over the last while. This issue has been gaining quite a bit of traction in the media over here and gaining public support as far as I can see. Aside from this particular issue Mandate and related groups have been traveling around the country organizing, hosting talks and inviting workers from the bar and retail industry who are on precarious zero hour contracts or whose employers dock wages when tills are short etc. \n\nHere is the article pasted from the link: \n\n\nLLOYDS WORKERS THANK PUBLIC FOR SUPPORT\nMandate Trade Union has criticised management in Lloyds Pharmacy for leaving their workers with no option but to participate in a two hour strike today (Friday, 22nd June 2018) from 10am-12noon in 34 stores across Ireland.\n\nLast Thursday 29 Lloyds Pharmacy stores took industrial action for one hour after their company refused to accept a Labour Court recommendation and negotiate with their trade union Mandate.\n\nToday up to 230 workers are escalating the strike with an additional five stores joining the picket lines for an extra hour. This brings the total striking stores to 34, along with delivery drivers.\n\nMandate say the company has left the workers with no alternative but to strike.\n\nGerry Light, Mandate Assistant General Secretary said:\n\n\u201cOur members do not want to be out on strike today. No worker wants to take industrial action. But the Lloyds workers are extremely frustrated because they know all it would take to resolve this dispute is for the company to sit down and negotiate with their trade union.\u201d\n\nSamantha Lennon, who has worked in her pharmacy for 8 years thanked the public for their support:\n\n\u201cThe support we\u2019ve received so far from the public has been overwhelming. We had lots of people come down to the picket lines last week to say well done to us for sticking up for ourselves. It\u2019s great to hear that from customers you\u2019ve been serving for years. They know what our issues are and they\u2019re 100 percent behind us.\u201d\n\nCommenting on taking action for a second time, Ms Lennon said:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very disappointed it\u2019s come to this. We had hoped management would contact our union before today so that we wouldn\u2019t have to go on strike. We\u2019ve been to the Labour Court and they agreed that our company should engage with us through our union. Sadly this hasn\u2019t happened so we\u2019ve been forced to go on strike again.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWe\u2019re very sorry to inconvenience our customers. They know how much they mean to us and we always do our best by them, but we cannot continue to allow this level of disrespect to continue. All we are looking for is the rights that workers in other pharmacies like Boots have.\u201d\n\nAddressing claims by the company that they do not operate zero hour contracts and that the company is discussing conditions of employment with the company\u2019s internal staff committee, Mr Light said the company\u2019s arguments are misleading and disingenuous.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve published two zero hour contracts offered by Lloyds Pharmacy and yet Lloyds continue to say they do not offer them. This is misleading, at best, and is exactly why our members do not trust the company and want independent representation.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe company keep referring to progress being made with their \u2018CRC\u2019, which was established by management and is funded by LloydsPharmacy, as the company confirmed to the Labour Court. It has no legal status. It has no negotiating license and is simply a sophisticated anti-union tactic imported from the United States in order to ensure workers do not have the right to independent representation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur members are not stupid, they understand exactly what the company are doing,\u201d said Mr Light.\n\n\u201cInstead of putting so much energy and resources into union busting and insulting their workers\u2019 intelligence, Lloyds Pharmacy should do the decent thing by their employees and by the public by picking up the phone to Mandate Trade Union today,\u201d concluded Mr Light.\n\nThe Labour Court recommendation stated: \u201cthe Court recommends that the parties engage in order to seek agreement in relation to the matters raised by the Trade Union.\u201d\n\nThe strike relates to a claim by Mandate Trade Union on behalf of its 230 members employed by LloydsPharmacy which includes:\n\nA pay increase and incremental pay scales;\nThe introduction of a sick pay scheme;\nSecurity of hours and the elimination of zero hour contracts; and\nImprovements in annual leave entitlements and public holiday premiums.\n\nNOTE\n\nLloydsPharmacy is Ireland\u2019s largest pharmaceutical chain operating 88 stores across the country with approximately 800 workers employed in their pharmacies.\n\nLloydsPharmacy is owned by the McKesson Corporation which is the largest pharmaceutical company in the world with revenues of \u20ac169 billion in 2017 \u2013 more than double the revenue of the Irish state.\n\nMcKesson also own UDG Healthcare (formerly United Drug) which is headquartered in Ireland, and where the workers are afforded their right to trade union representation (SIPTU and Unite represent staff in Ireland).\n\n","created_utc":1529788575,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"KangarooJesus","body":"&gt;Dogs can be dangerous. They can kill people, and very quickly at that. Us human beings have this thing called a throat, and if at any point something sharp is to enter it, such as a dogs teeth, we very much can die. Even a dog this size could knock a man over and get at his throat. \n\nLots of things can be dangerous which usually are not. This dog was not trained to kill or ordered to attack anyone like a police dog would be. He was barking at someone he doesn't know entering his house. Pizza delivery guys are put in this situation daily and don't have to shoot any dogs. Same thing with emergency medical personnel, and just like any regular person entering a house with a protective (or even aggressive, which this dog was not) dog. \n\n&gt;In this moment that is a large animal with a lot of teeth lunging at you. \n\nWatch the video. \n\nThe dog doesn't even move towards the cop before he fires two shots. They bark twice without moving, and the cop gets \"scared\" and fucking shoots in the direction of a dog and a child, hits neither, and the ricochet wounds both.\n\n&gt;I think what the officer did was wrong, but reasonable.\n\nHe made several mistakes, and reason was involved in zero of his decisions. \n\n1) Thinking the situation gave him license to draw his weapon\n\n2) Thinking the situation gave him license to fire his weapon\n\n3) Not caring for collateral damage, and failing to actually aim for his target\n\nAfterwards the policeman is asked what happened and he says \"dog attacked us\" (which it didn't) and that he discharged his gun. He doesn't explain why there are now children screaming or that he injured a civilian. Clearly this man is sharp enough for the liberal ideal of the job. \/s\n\n&gt;I don't think there should be punishment for what happened.\n\nHe scarred some children for life, and injured one (possibly permanent damage to the kid's vision). Don't know how well this family pet that didn't attack the officer is doing, it doesn't seem to have died, but it may have afterwards. Getting the dog to the vet and getting the child medical treatment is going to cost some money as well. \n\nAll because of that officer's poor judgement.\n\n&gt;My issue here isn't with what this cop did. Its with what we let happen to society where this can happen again.\n\nYes, a society where police exist and a great many people are driven to commit suicide is the root of the problem here. As an anarchist I agree. However I also don't think that you should shoot at dogs and children for no reason, and recognize that all police are complicit in evil as their very position is a social malice. \n\n&gt;But mental health care could have stopped this situation from reaching the point of someone being a danger to there own life. Or better yet, we could live in a society where the need for owning a gun for home defense wasn't a thing.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\n&gt;I'm gorwing tired of people always blaming cops when something horrible like this happens. Fuck that guy, he's just trying to do what he thinks is right, even if he is wrong. He's not the one we should be angry at.\n\nYes, fuck that guy and his ignorance. We can't get anywhere without holding people accountable for their actions. Everyone in the world is \"trying to do what [they] think is right\", but some people in doing so are actively ruining the lives of others, and contributing much much more to the social woe than the social weal. They don't get off Scotch free for that. Saying \"he's just doing his job\" is reductive and skirts around the issue, you can't get rid of that job without treating it as it is. Yes some cops are \"good people\" as individuals or at heart or whatever, and I'm sure some of the men enlisted in the fascist war machines of the earlier part of last century were too. But if we had kept blabbering about how they were good people, we would've not recognized and been able to tackle their horrible deeds. People should be judged for their actions, even if it's not their fault ultimately, because ultimately no one gets to choose their lot in life. \n\n&gt;Its the people who built countries where cops are the bad guys that I feel like we should hate. The people who took kind hearted men and women and warped them into weapons to keep themselves in power. The people who could care less about a human life if it put more money in there pockets. \n\nYes, but cops exist specifically to fill that role. The cops aren't going to turn their weapons against the bourgeoisie lest they stop being cops. Fuck the police. \n\n&gt;But no, it's the cops fault we all cry. And so we band together and say fuck all cops, we chose the smallest fucking hill for a movement to die on. We sit here and complain about a symptom, when we should be about fighting the disease. \n\nThe cops are part of the disease. Symptoms of the disease would be poverty, actual disease, ignorance, etc. The police force is actually a fundamental apparatus of the state and of capital; what you're saying is nonsensical. \n\n","created_utc":1529791961,"score":8,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"gnomegorsky","body":"The moment the white cop decided to withdraw his weapon, look at a young black kid running away from him, and pull the trigger, ending his life, is a defining moment. He made a choice at that moment to become a killer. To end another human being\u2019s life. Call it legal, call it criminal, a rose is still a rose by any other name. That cop became a murderer that day, a cold blooded assassin. All this within the historical context of an American caste system that has subjugated black people and continues up to this instant to its practices of lynching and brutality. Your use of the law as a crutch, and to provide justification for murder is weak and lacks moral and ethical conviction. Further, your peculiar fancy for authority and police seems counter to the basic principles of American society, a society that celebrates rebellion, anti-authority, refusing to succumb to power and domination, and to engage in transgressive behavior in the face of hostile authority. Your legal argument grasps at straws and seems like a desperate attempt to hold onto some vanishing fundamental principles in the wake of a law enforcement institution that grows increasingly illegitimate. And that is where we stand now. Many people are beginning to realize that the criminal justice system and its enforcement agents are no longer legitimate. Your so-called legal argument and touting of false facts that black people and people of color are somehow more violent or commit more violent crimes are the absurdities that justify illegitimate institutions. When cops murder, they are no longer credible. When nation states terrorize, they are no longer credible. When the contradictions expose the gaping holes of hegemony, only a willful ignorance and absurd legal arguments serve as the veil to keep safe, orthodox unreality real.\n\nLook into who has been more violent in the past two centuries. Who has violently killed more people? The answer is not among the black and brown folks, but those who command our most powerful institutions that has wreaked the most havoc, and caused the most destruction, ending human life and robbing the living of their wealth. Those who write history and create false narratives (and memory holes) to justify endless torture, genocide, rape, and destruction of the people, the animals, the planet. To not see this is not only to deny your own agency, but to deny a reality slapping you right in the face. Perhaps willful ignorance will hold this country together, but the clock is ticking. \n\nAs far as empathy is concerned, the Christian theologian argued Kierkegaard that the separation of empathy from the intellect is the mark of civilization\u2019s decline. It is clear that this civilization is in decline and you are on the wrong side of history. I stand with the institutionally vulnerable and oppressed classes.

Tolkien portrays monarchies as just and good (e.g. Gondor) whilst also romanticising decentralised rural living (e.g. the Hobbits).

He's interested in ways of organising society that are virtuous and accord with some greater, religious-inspired hierarchy. \nIt should be a big clue that in the Tolkien fiction universe, social justice does not involve a *progression* to a better society, it involves a *restoration* to a golden past: Aragorn ascends to the throne and restores the original monarchy.\n\n[I wrote about this in a comment on r\/Arabs a while ago](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/arabs\/comments\/8atcxo\/if_middle_eastern_nationalities_were_fantasy\/dx23vvb\/) if you're interested in reading.","created_utc":1529853343,"score":8,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

To not look at those things as exploitable is in my opinion a tactical error, considering much of the energy generated by fascists was built on a weaponized and easily memed irony that the left frankly had absolutely no counter to due to a sort of \"humor brain drain\" precipitated by circular firing squads operating on pop culture purity tests. We eat our clowns alive as soon as they step out of very narrow parameters or, God forbid, turn their satire inward.\n\nHolding oneself to maintaining a moral high ground in the face of rampant immoral violent oppression is a fool's errand. Stokely Carmichael said \"appealing to your oppressor's conscience only works if your oppressor has a conscience.\" I'm interested in living in a world where we are universally kind to each other. That world doesn't exist yet, and the people standing in the way of it are laughing as we wring our hands over language instead of taking action. Much of this debacle could've been avoided had we called a pig a fucking pig, skewered the sexual dysfunctions of the incels rather than tried to understand them, and not become shrunken violets every time Stephen Crowder or Jordan Peterson chastised someone for being rude or interrupting. Respectability is over, and these people deserve absolutely no quarter or place in the discourse. Until the (US) anarchist movement puts a knife in its teeth and stops navel-gazing about identity politics and marketability, I don't have a ton of hope it will shed its image as uptight, stuffy, and humorless, leading the youth and lower classes to continue partying with the reactionaries.\n\nJust as \"violent\" direct action might not be for all of us, I'm not advocating everyone to get ready to sling mud like they're Doug Stanhope. Anecdotally, I can recall several times friends \"let me off the leash\" so to speak and how effective it was in terms of shutting down enemies. Those friends had known me as an organizer for years and years, always knowing where my empathy falls, and rarely took it personally if I skirted outside the realm of the standard definitions of political correctness to wound someone that wouldn't think twice to use *legislation*, much less slurs or threats, to hurt them.\n\nUnfortunately, I believe the time to have this discussion was like five years ago. I see encouraging developments in the more radical side of the podcast scene and several egoist writers. I just can't believe I see this post about not calling cops pigs just about every week on this board, which I've always maintained was A LOT more liberal than most anarchists I've known IRL. We should be far passed these kinds of discussions, as there are concentration camps on the borders, Nazis marching in the street, and cops murdering POCs on an almost daily basis. Policing language and haranguing the few comedians we have left should be the last thing on our minds.","created_utc":1529898471,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Citrakayah","body":"&gt; The article Trolling_Hamster shared with me (https:\/\/www.cabi.org\/isc\/datasheet\/74428) claims that the sustained presence of otters in the UK is a major barrier to the spread of mink, and recommends recovering those populations elsewhere across Europe. The trend of greater biodiversity increasing an ecosystem's resiliency to invasive species is well understood, as the presence of competitors and natural enemies becomes more likely. The ecosystem of western Europe is by and large already collapsed.\n\nIt's well-established science is that greater biodiversity mitigates the impact of an invasive species, yes. However, that is a long way from saying that most invasive species are only able to colonize because humans wiped out a native species that would compete with it.\n\nRegarding mink, while the presence of otters may drive down their population and alter their ecology, the species that is closest in ecology isn't the European otter, it's the European mink, and the [same paper](https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1080\/03014223.2003.9518350) you're citing argues that American mink outcompete European mink.\n\n&gt;  Google trophic cascade and consider that insect populations have declined 75% in Germany in the last 30 years. (https:\/\/phys.org\/news\/2017-10-three-quarters-total-insect-population-lost.html)\n\nI'm aware of it, but that has more to do with habitat destruction and insecticide use than global climate change.

{"author":"TheNotoriousAMP","body":"Fighting back against what?\n\n (Tl;dr: toys r us was already declining in the mid 2000's, meaning that Bain likely bought a solid near decade or more of employment for Toys R Us workers compared to letting it stay public and likely face stockholder liquidation during the late 2000's financial crash).\n\nBain capital didn't pay a ton to buy a company with the goal of destroying their asset and not make money. They bought a struggling company in the mid-2000's that was hemorrhaging market share with the hope of turning it around. The debt they loaded it with was necessary to gain control of the company (you take a company private because of the limitations that shareholder rights place on your freedom of movement--especially in regards to major changes to the company) in order to turn it around. It's like mortgaging a property with the hope of making it good by renting it out. In this case, sales weren't enough to pay the interest taken out to buy it in the first place.\n\nThe problem isn't Bain, it's that the retail market has strongly shifted. Wal-Mart passed Toys R Us in toy sales in the late 90's, meaning it was locking down the impulse in store buy aspect of the market, while Amazon basically started capping the planned out \"toy of the year\" market. Toys R Us had more of a niche than most retailers, but it was a collapsing one.\n\nHad the buy out not occurred, and Toys R Us remained public, it would have been liquidated in the late 2000's as stockholders tried to get something for their value. Likely they would have accepted a cheap buyout from a raider\/demanded valuations and fair market value for their stock in a forced buy back when the company tried to make major reforms. This would have put everyone out of work nearly 10 years ago.\n\nThe workers are free to organize, try and get a leadership structure together, raise the capital needed and purchase the company. It's just really unlikely to happen, and would be a colossal waste of their money.\n\nAlso, before the bonuses are brought up, they weren't paid. The bankruptcy code prevents bonus payment to executives of companies in bankruptcy. The judge approved performance incentives for a target that wasn't met, meaning no one got paid.","created_utc":1529963919,"score":-4,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Even after bodies were discovered.\n\nThese white people &amp; journalists talking about being civil? These were the rich people, the Fil-Chinese, the mestizos in the Philippines who knew they won't be affected by many of Marcos' policies, and therefore could ignore them even as the killings started.\n\nMarcos was also adept at convincing regular Filipinos that \"as long as you don't commit crimes I won't come for you. I'm only getting rid of the 'filth'.\" He lied, of course. He jailed his most vocal opponents, people whose businesses he wanted to confiscate for his use.\n\nBut Filipinos have always been susceptible to strongman personality cults, just like your Republicans.\n\n(Yeah don't @ me on this one, Repubs still singing Reagan's praises despite the fact he was FRIENDS with Marcos and helped him retain power, making it 1000x worse for us.)\n\nWhite people, journalists who insist on civility- you seem to think civility is a common ground you share with opponents like Trump et al. Here's a clue - whenever you offer these assholes middle ground, they will invade that space &amp; then claim you never gave them ground at all.\n\nMarcos kept pushing. First it was all protesters were communists. All student protesters. Then it was the free press. Then it was the people with businesses he coveted. And then it was anyone who looked at Imelda Marcos or his daughter, Imee, wrong. Arrested, raped, murdered.\n\nAnd every step of the way there were the same kind of fuckwits here twittering on about how people should be civil, SURELY Marcos wouldn't go that far, the economy is flourishing surely it can't be THAT bad.\n\n\"It didn't happen to ME, so it must not be bad.\" up till Martial Law.\n\nWhite people asking for performative civility do the same thing they did, for the same reason - they're afraid. You've never been raised to fear discrimination or prejudice against a system that has always been built in your favor for centuries.\n\nYour argument for civility is a terrified lashing out against an uncertain future that your ancestors \/ fellow white people have subjected people of color to for centuries. It's built in POC culture to learn how to cope with this. You've had none, because you've never needed to.\n\nBecause regardless of whether you want it or not, status quo benefits white people best. In any upheaval, white people have the least casualties. That makes them the last demographic wanting to rock the boat, even if the boat is full of Nazis steering it straight into Auschwitz.\n\nBecause you know Auschwitz isn't going to be for you. It's gonna be Auschwitz for a lot of people in that same boat you're on, but you know that's not for you. And that's why you can afford to be compliant.\n\nAnd here's the kicker: YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT CIVIL. That's why it's the liberals you keep appealing to for decorum and politeness. You know you're not going to get most Trumpsters on board anything amounting to basic decency.\n\nSo you shift the goalposts, and you enable the gaslighting, even if inadvertently. \"Maybe if YOU hadn't been so rude they wouldn't have done that.\"\n\nBullshit. You KNOW they'll do it anyway because again, your goddamn status quo.\n\nPeople invested in putting kids in cages don't want your civility. They don't want you to extend them the same courtesy they never had - and never wanted - from you. What they want is for you to retreat.\n\nAnd every ground you grudgingly give, hoping that they'll construe that as some good faith on your part, is only an incentive for them to push harder until you have no ground left.\n\nThen they're going to tell you they've owned the land all along.\n\n\"So much for the tolerant left.\" This is why they say this all the fucking time. This is the bait they expect you to fall for. Your required \"tolerance\" for the things they do, even as they do the exact opposite to you.\n\nThe first requirement when approaching any discussion with civility is that both sides must come to the table with it. The side that advocates putting kids in cages and are now thinking of stripping citizenship from legal green card holders, never had that to begin with.\n\nNow: if you are REALLY invested in still keeping civil after this, there are countless unaffiliated Red Hen places in the US (+one in Canada) being egged, getting death threats, etc.\n\nTry discussing \"civility\" with those people this time, &amp; see how well that works out for you. - Rin Chupeco","created_utc":1529997787,"score":8,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Why is food supply crippled? Where have the millions of homeless sprung from? How are immigrants displacing homeowners? How are poor immigrants outcompeting American renters? Why isn't real estate in South America becoming cheaper to compensate and enticing people not to move away? Why are people starving? Who? The immigrants? Why are they moving to be homeless and starving? \n\n&gt;Which would result in labor becoming devalued even more than it is now, wages collapsing, many out of work, etc.\n\nUnemployment, wages, exploitation etc are not linked to population. World population has exploded in the past 150 years and this is not linked to an explosion in unemployment or implosion of wages. In the US, since world war 2 real compensation per hour [has tripled](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/COMPRNFB) while population has pretty much doubled.\n\nAn increased labour force [increases demand for goods and services](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lump_of_labour_fallacy), thus creating more jobs. [This paper](http:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w21123) estimates that each immigrant actually *creates* 1.2 jobs through stimulating demand.\n\nStudies of the Mariel Boat Lift, where a large number of Cuban immigrants all joined the Miami labor market in a short period of time, increasing labor supply by 7% very quickly, found that there was [practically no impact on wages and employment for locals](https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/2523702?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).\n\nThe most comprehensive recent study on the impacts of immigration, the behemoth [500 page report](https:\/\/www.nap.edu\/read\/23550\/chapter\/1) from the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, a joint effort from 14 economists, demographers and other academics reviewing several decades of data on immigration and its impact concludes:\n\n* When measured over a period of 10 years or more, the impact of immigration on the wages of native-born workers overall is very small. To the extent that negative impacts occur, they are most likely to be found for prior immigrants or native-born workers who have not completed high school\u2014who are often the closest substitutes for immigrant workers with low skills.\n* There is little evidence that immigration significantly affects the overall employment levels of native-born workers. As with wage impacts, there is some evidence that recent immigrants reduce the employment rate of prior immigrants.\n* Evidence on the inflow of high-skilled immigrants suggests that there may be positive wage effects for some subgroups of native-born workers, and other, wider benefits to the economy more broadly.\n* Immigration has an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the U.S.\n* In terms of fiscal impacts, first-generation immigrants are more costly to governments, mainly at the state and local levels, than are the native-born, in large part due to the costs of educating their children. However, as adults, the children of immigrants (the second generation) are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the U.S. population, contributing more in taxes than either their parents or the rest of the native-born population.\n* Over the long term, the impacts of immigrants on government budgets are generally positive at the federal level but remain negative at the state and local level \u2014 but these generalizations are subject to a number of important assumptions. Immigration\u2019s fiscal effects vary tremendously across states.\n\nIt is consensus that both [high-skilled immigrants](http:\/\/www.igmchicago.org\/surveys\/high-skilled-immigrants) and [low-skilled immigrants](http:\/\/www.igmchicago.org\/surveys\/low-skilled-immigrants) are net economic gains. And although controversial, immigration may [positively impact poor\/unskilled native wages](https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/jeea\/article-abstract\/10\/1\/152\/2182016).\n\n&gt; in the period from 1990 to 2006 immigration had a small effect on the wages of native workers with no high school degree (between 0.6% and +1.7%). It also had a small positive effect on average native wages (+0.6%)\n\n[Here is another study (PDF)](https:\/\/www.econstor.eu\/bitstream\/10419\/110686\/1\/dp8961.pdf)\n\n&gt; We find that an increase in the supply of refugee-country immigrants pushed less educated native workers (especially the young and low-tenured ones) to pursue less manual-intensive occupations. As a result immigration had positive effects on native unskilled wages, employment and occupational mobility.\n\n[Another](http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/ecoj.12077\/full)\n\n&gt;We find that immigration had a positive effect on the wages of less educated natives and it increased or left unchanged the average native wages. \n\n[Here](https:\/\/wol.iza.org\/articles\/do-immigrant-workers-depress-the-wages-of-native-workers\/long) is a lit review that finds\n\n&gt;Short-term wage effects of immigrants are close to zero\u2014and in the long term immigrants can boost productivity and wages\n\n*Illegal* immigrants *are* at greater risk of [exploitation](https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1111\/j.1533-8525.2011.01221.x) - so the solution is to open the borders and make all immigration legal.\n\nFree immigration is one of the most liberating policies possible, and is an [enormous economic boom](https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S1094202512000415) which will in the end benefit everyone.","created_utc":1530008798,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Nonfiction-wise I think Ehrenreich's \"Nickle and Dimed\" would be better for young readers then many of the other suggestions (due to it's being a memoir), though \"Bait and Switch\" is probably a better skewer of capitalism (and focuses on educated white-collar folks -- i.e., those who, according to the cultural narrative, should be above the indignities suffered by \"the poors.\" A good lesson in \"no one is safe from capital\").\n\nInstead of presenting a politics or critique that may offer an uncomfortable challenge to the worldview, simply get them to start asking questions about the gulf between the American Dream and the American Reality.

It's something of a trap when you start basing your actions on what other groups think is *acceptable.* Suddenly, you'll find yourself doing things like trying very hard to show how *nonviolent* you are in order to appease liberals or whatever to a point where you've essentially become a very effectively domesticated group of people who will not indulge in any kind of effective direct-action, including defensive acts.

{"author":"brother_beer","body":"&gt; Secondly, it suggests that this subreddit's community has a problem distinguishing ignorance from apathy from disdain.\n\nI think this is a point that should resonate with a lot of us who often find ourselves having to combat stereotypes attached to the names of leftist positions, especially in the United States. Anarchy does not mean chaos, socialism does not mean government-issue toothbrushes, and communism doesn't mean Stalin.\n\nWe are careful enough to know when to assess whether or not *our* words are being used in ways consistent with what we mean when talking to those to our right so communication can occur. But when someone calls themselves a liberal, can we really trust that they are using the word in the way we would use it, and don't we owe them at the least generosity enough to determine exactly what they mean?\n\nIt's probably a fair characterization to say that \"liberal\" and \"conservative\" are roughly equivalent to Democrat and Republican when used by the majority of people from the States. So if you find that you're disgusted by Republican policies and associated rhetorics, then I guess you must be a liberal. This is a problematic thing for those of us on the left for a lot of reasons, including but not limited to:\n\n* Reduction to a binary (albeit one that goes beyond rhetoric and is logical outcome of the electoral system at present.\n* Misuse of terms. (What is a liberal? -- US vs. EU uses, historical origins of the words, associations with managerialism, etc.)\n* The implicit assumption that capitalism is beyond question (since everyone \"respectable\" is either a liberal or a conservative, and reinforces the binary; liberals being referred to and embracing being \"leftists\" despite history or international comparison). \n\nThis last one is pretty deep. In addition to being fed propaganda about leftist tendencies, consider that a lot of young liberals have known no other world than one that has seen the rotten corruption of individualism under the neoliberal policies of Reagan\/Thatcher. Mass movements such as the Civil Rights Movement in the US in the 1950's - 70's are lauded as successful, despite being violently quashed once King started talking about class. The entire story isn't being told, and what remains is a model of resistance that does not acknowledge class and serves as a framework not only in a strategic way but in an ideological one, too: (nonviolent protests work, and only essentialist\/individualist topics allowed). We can march about black people. We can march about gay people. But we can't march about poor people because no one is born poor. And god help you if we decide your rally is getting out of hand.\n\nSo you're born in the US, and you're average (and probably white, let's be honest) and you go to an average school and you live in an average town and half the doctor's office lobbies have CNN on the TV and the other half are tuned to Fox News. You think it's wrong that the police are killing people, and that it's wrong to harass LGBTQ folks, and it's wrong that the minimum wage isn't high enough for a parent to support her children, and it's wrong that people in need of medical care have to choose between that and paying their rent. And the people on the news, in the papers, at the podiums who share your contempt for these things -- all liberals. So now you're a liberal.\n\nAt no time did you enthusiastically support or defend markets. You think police who kill innocents should be locked up, but you never think about how the justice system is structurally incapable of handling itself and ACAB is true because they aid and abet that system. You're pro-gay marriage and in favor of extending federal protected classes to include LGBTQ folks, because then those individuals wronged can seek redress in court. You're pro minimum wage because money exists and always has existed, and how else do you get it except by working for someone else so at least it should be fair, right? You're pro universal insurance coverage, which you admit isn't as good as free-at-point-of-service models (though we should totally cover the poor anyway (who are they again?)) because both your lauded liberal leaders and the crafty conservative cretins say it's unrealistic.\n\nBut there are things you've seen online about anarchists and socialists supporting the same ideas as you do. And you're bright enough to realize that there's probably more to these ideas than Stalin and gulags as the imperial narrative alleges. And you see them getting mad at liberals. \n\n*Is that me? Maybe not -- I recognize that some Democrats are \"not as left\" as others. Bernie Sanders! Gee, some of what they say sounds good. But some of it sounds ridiculous. No state? How do we roads!? I'd like to see what's up. They say a lot of smart stuff, so I think I could talk to them...*\n\n\"Hi anarchists, liberal here, and I'm curious abo--\"\n\n\"Fuck off, bootlicker.\"\n\nI mean, plenty of people call themselves \"capitalists\" when really they are just wage slaves like me. They don't own capital and use others' labor to power it. Maybe they have a 401k, but that's it.\n\nFuck liberals, sure.

{"author":"CheGuevaraProject","body":"Graeber is talking about money as a medium of exchange (coinage) was essentially a government enterprise: \n\"So the real question is not how does barter generate some sort of medium of exchange, that then becomes money, but rather, how does that broad sense of \u2018I owe you one\u2019 turn into a precise system of measurement \u2013 that is: money as a unit of account?\n\nBy the time the curtain goes up on the historical record in ancient Mesopotamia, around 3200 BC, it\u2019s already happened. There\u2019s an elaborate system of money of account and complex credit systems. (Money as medium of exchange or as a standardized circulating units of gold, silver, bronze or whatever, only comes much later.)\n\nSo really, rather than the standard story \u2013 first there\u2019s barter, then money, then finally credit comes out of that \u2013 if anything its precisely the other way around. Credit and debt comes first, then coinage emerges thousands of years later and then, when you do find \u201cI\u2019ll give you twenty chickens for that cow\u201d type of barter systems, it\u2019s usually when there used to be cash markets, but for some reason \u2013 as in Russia, for example, in 1998 \u2013 the currency collapses or disappears.\"\n\nand\n...\n\"Well historically, there seem to have been two possibilities.\n\nOne is what you found in Egypt: a strong centralized state and administration extracting taxes from everyone else. For most of Egyptian history they never developed the habit of lending money at interest. Presumably, they didn\u2019t have to.\n\nMesopotamia was different because the state emerged unevenly and incompletely. At first there were giant bureaucratic temples, then also palace complexes, but they weren\u2019t exactly governments and they didn\u2019t extract direct taxes \u2013 these were considered appropriate only for conquered populations. Rather they were huge industrial complexes with their own land, flocks and factories. This is where money begins as a unit of account; it\u2019s used for allocating resources within these complexes.\n\nInterest-bearing loans, in turn, probably originated in deals between the administrators and merchants who carried, say, the woollen goods produced in temple factories (which in the very earliest period were at least partly charitable enterprises, homes for orphans, refugees or disabled people for instance) and traded them to faraway lands for metal, timber, or lapis lazuli. The first markets form on the fringes of these complexes and appear to operate largely on credit, using the temples\u2019 units of account. But this gave the merchants and temple administrators and other well-off types the opportunity to make consumer loans to farmers, and then, if say the harvest was bad, everybody would start falling into debt-traps. \"\n\nWhere does he say that money as a universal medium of exchange ever existed without government?","created_utc":1530158705,"score":-1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

But the Rocker reference I made above states:\n\n&gt; Their organisation is accordingly constructed on the following principles: The workers in each locality join the unions for their respective trades, and these are subject to the veto of no Central but enjoy the entire right of self-determination. The trade unions of a city or rural district combine in a so-called labour cartel. The labour cartels constitute the centres for local propaganda and education; they weld the workers together as a class and prevent the rise of any narrow-minded factional spirit. In times of local labour trouble they arrange for the solidaric co-operation of the whole body of organised labour in the use of every agency available under the circumstances. All the labour cartels are grouped according to districts and regions to form the National Federation of Labour Cartels, which maintain the permanent connection between the local bodies, arranges for free adjustment of the productive labour of the members of the different organisations on co-operative lines, provide for the necessary co-operation in the field of education, in which the stronger cartels will need to come to the aid of the weaker ones, and in general support the local groups with council and guidance.\n\nYou may be able to argue that this form of resembles a government, but it is far from being a structure as oppressive as a capitalist government.\n\nFurthermore I'm confused why you are using the word \"nation\". States, governments, borders, languages, and such are usually associated with the formation of a \"nation\", however not necessarily so, but it makes strange associations to use \"nation\" in relation to anarchism.

Some areas may be more right-wing \"libertarian\" and thus maybe be a little uncomfortable with anarchist economics, but generally are more amenable to things like immigration or gay rights; other areas might be more nationalist or fundamentalist, which in that case, you can't find common ground even in the most superficial sense with people. I've had the misfortune of coming across the latter more often, but could just be a regional thing specific to where I'm at.\n\nAs for immigrants communities within the larger rural communities, that's a different story. Of course, you have those immigrants with the \"forget about you, I got mine\" mentality, but for the most part, solidarity and workers' rights are bigger within us Latinos. Anarchism by name in specific, no; but we got each others backs. Most of the work done in my area is workers' rights for temporary workers and immigration resources (non-anarchist, of course). There is also some  other non-profits, charities, and other types of organizations that tend to help out immigrant workers.

Sometimes mass gatherings are an effective tool, though I would argue, overused. The [2005 Toledo Riot](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2005_Toledo_riot) is a good example of effectively doing this right, canvassing and outreach in affected communities rather than in the broader left. Of organizing around a tangible threat rather than coalition building with the usual suspects. I'm not saying that's easy to do, just that it's worth doing whenever possible. It's easier, and much more important, when they try to rally near precarious residential communities.\n\nThe national focus on antifa is, IMO, not a good thing. Antifa would be better served by shutting down fascist organizing while keeping themselves, and by extension the fash, off of the evening news. Fascism has an undeniable mass appeal when liberalism fails, unfortunately. It feeds on attention, and spreads through dogwhistles and plausible deniability that the center won't let itself see. But fascism doesn't really create that many true believers, people that will stick with it when put to a fair fight. It's weak to groups of small, committed, cohesive crews that take the fight to them. This most often looks like outing them individually in their neighborhoods and workplaces, though or course there does need to be a credible threat behind that tactic. Most of them are weak to social pressure when they're kept isolated. Although, that does bring up the problem of how effectively fash radicalize online and how difficult it is to keep them fragmented.\n\nThose are also, as far as I'm concerned, reasons to only go after actual genuine fascists. A strategy of isolation doesn't work so well when they're commiserating with every JP neckbeard fanboy in NA.

Some of those were:\n\n- The confederation reorganized itself within unique industry unions. This strategy, united the workers of every productive branch, in order to become more powerful\n\n- The preeminence of direct action as the main tool to achieve the worker's rights.\n\n- To mantain the sindicalist autonomy towards political parties and parlamentarism in order to not be influenced by the the latters. Professional politicians weren't allowed anymore to represent the organitzation anymore either.\n\n- Boost the female unionization, which was a minority.\n\n- Impulse and promote rationalist schools.\n\nSome other agreements defended the 8hours day-work, minimul salaries set by the unions, the abolition of pay-for-production work, overtime hours and minors exploitation.\n\nThis structure, pushed by workers like Salvador Segu\u00ed, \u00c1ngel Pesta\u00f1a, Joan Peir\u00f3, Mestres and Pallej\u00e0, made possible a hughe growth of CNT in Catalonia (and later on Spain), which developed into a lot more of sindicalist victories, making possible strikes like 1919's canadense strike (so far Catalonia's history most important one), a fourthy-four days general strike, which forced the 8 hours work day in whole Spain.","created_utc":1530288816,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

She is also by far the hardest and most skilled worker. She is worth at least 5 other employees in labor production. The company also donates to local schools, fire departments, and community programs (like 4H, FFA, etc.). It is by far the most moral \"business\" I've seen, because it operates almost as a co-op. She also treats her employees better than herself, there is also very limited nepotism. I am the lowest paid employee despite being arguably the most skilled.

Even legal immigrants cannot access cash welfare assistance for families with children, and also food stamps, Medicaid, SCHIP, and SSI. Even permanent residents with a greencard need to wait five years to be eligible for pretty much any welfare.\n\nAnd immigrants are generally [more willing to work](https:\/\/qz.com\/645033\/illegal-us-immigrants-far-likelier-to-be-working-than-american-men\/), [more entreprenurial](https:\/\/hbr.org\/2016\/10\/why-are-immigrants-more-entrepreneurial), and [harder working than natives](http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/full\/10.1177\/0950017017706306) (until they assimilate into the lazier native population that is!). This is all largely due to the self-selection of being the people willing to uproot their lives and move across the globe - they do not want to languish on welfare forever.\n\n&gt;How many people do you think would come if we had open borders?\n\nAround [1 in 10 people want to migrate](https:\/\/news.gallup.com\/poll\/153992\/150-million-adults-worldwide-migrate.aspx) and around 20% of those would like to move to the US, equalling 150 million. However, this was under ideal circumstances. In reality, people need to think about jobs, they need to think about housing, they need to think about their families. *I* would ideally move to the US, but I'm not giving up my good job to be homeless in the US. I'm not going to leave my partner behind while she finishes her PhD. A quick google says there are only 20,000,000 vacant homes in America and 6,000,000 open jobs, that in itself is going to limit many many people from immigrating.\n\nIf we look for a comparison, German wages are twice as good as Greece's, it has much lower unemployment, less debt, and is generally just better off. There are open borders between them. In seven years from 2010 to 2017, 150,000 Greeks moved to Germany. Roughly 1% of the Greek population and not even 0.2% of the German population.\n\n&gt;Also you haven\u2019t been paying attention to current news if you think illegals don\u2019t get a break on committing crimes .\n\nIs this a large systemic thing, or do you just have a handful of anecdotes?

I posted this reference in another post a couple minutes ago, but Dave Chapelle has this bit about a book he read, *Pimp* by Iceberg Slim\n\n&gt;Iceberg Slim breaks down some of the coldest capitalist concepts I\u2019ve ever heard in my life. He describes in detail how these men break women so that they will give them the money that they make with their own bodies. There\u2019s a story in here so cold, it makes me shudder to think about it. Iceberg Slim is trying to control the woman that he finds uncontrollable. So he asks an older pimp how he can rein her in. And the older pimp says, \u201cOh, that\u2019s easy, Iceberg. All you have to do is beat that bitch with a coat hanger. And then run her a bath. And give her some pills. She\u2019ll be so grateful that you fixed her, that she\u2019ll forget you were the motherfucker that beat her in the first place.\u201d That\u2019s some cold shit.\n\nI wonder about the work that we can ~~do~~ focus on that happens underground that doesn't force the people you're talking about, those that are hungry and homeless, to resort to the state (which then fails them eventually, making them resort to capitalism, which fails them eventually, making them resort to the state, and so on...)\n\nI think Fred Moten's *fugitivity* might be a useful concept here. In the same way that we might capitalize, cynically, on a moment of crisis as a moment to organize, I wonder if we could be equally cynical towards those sutures.

However, it seems you missed the parts of my post which explained that it is very unlikely 150 million people would move to the US. Five million Japanese aren't going to just immediately get on a plane and fly to the United States without a good job lined up. Three million Brits aren't going to sell their homes and choose to be homeless in the United States. Have you never moved before? It's a big feat; just because people say \"oh yeah, ideally I would like to move to America\" doesn't mean they will.\n\n&gt;You don\u2019t live in a border state do you? \n\nI don't even live in America. I live in a country where over 1 in 3 are first generation immigrants, and over 50% have at least one foreign born parent, and we thrash America in metrics such as health, education, poverty, life expectancy, quality of life etc.\n\n&gt;They have WIC and once they have a child they get section 8, welfare and ebt. Also free insurance ...also no 5 year wait here in California.\n\n&gt;They also get tax credit for children even if they contribute nothing.\n\nAnd so what's your point? States can adjust their benefits scheme largely how they see fit. If immigrants are a big drain, why not make them ineligible? Though keep in mind, poor immigrants that are eligible for benefits use them [at a lesser rate than poor natives](https:\/\/www.cato.org\/publications\/economic-development-bulletin\/poor-immigrants-use-public-benefits-lower-rate-poor).

{"author":"anondogolador","body":"Trade has existed before Governments but Trade isn't Capitalism. Capitalism is a phenomenom that appeared in England when the lower classes had their ancient possessions confiscated (enclosure laws) forcing the peasants to leave their ancestral villages to move to big cities to try to survive.\n\nThat situation, plus the developments in mechanics and many cultural transformations, plus the monopoly of capital from the rulling classes created a situation of class division. Two classes were formed back then, the Bourgeois capitalist class who owns the means of production and the proletarian class who sells his own work to the owner of the means of production to survive.\n\nThis division is not, as many right wing liberals like to believe, \"natural\". Historically, the concept of \"property\" and the modern idea of \"private property\" were different concepts, with possession being recognized in pre-christian and medieval european cultures and most pre-industrial societies in some form. Possession meaning \"i own my piece of land where i live and use and my tools.\" The fields, rivers, meadows and pastures belonged to the commons. In the middle ages, there was no concept of private property, the closest thing to it was the authority to rule over lands as a noblemen, but even then, you were more like a ruler than a property owner since the land and the means of production was possession of the peasants and commoners.\n\nThis monopoly of land and production created a deep inequality and poverty in the third world, as traditional governments had to transform the lands that belonged to tribes or villages into private and public property as a way to modernize and industrialize, accepting the capitalist system. This caused massive poverty in the whole world causing \"rural exodus\" which in turn created modern slums in countries like Brazil or subsarahan countries or England way back then during the industrial revolution.\n\nSo, Capitalism isn't something as simple as free trade like american right wing politicians love to imply. Capitalism is historically a pretty unique phenomenom that changed the world radically and Capitalism is based on concepts like roman law Private Property (including absentee ownership and the right to use and abuse the land as the owner pleases) and the division of class (urban workers without land and means of production looking for a way to survive figuratively is what powers the engines of Capitalism)\n\nNow, regardless of the history of private property, why do i say that it is inherently oppressive and immoral:\n\n-It's not a right, it is a privilege that originates in Roman Law not too far from the privileges medieval lords expected.\n\n-The monopoly of land causes deep inequality and subordination. The owner of the land exploits and subjulgates the agrarian workers for their situation (their lack of productive means and their own property) and created the urban proletarian class. This arrangement is not natural, by a product of government intervention (after all, it is governments who created the idea of \"private property\".\n\n-Private property (and specially Absentee ownership) subtracts land from the commons and from productive use. Land is not produced by individuals or by god and given to humans as a right like classical Liberals claim, but was produced by the universe and is a limited resource that humans in general have a right to. By taking it from the commons and from productive use through artificial bureaucratic concepts, it is a theft because you are stealing this finite resource from the commons without their consent.\n\nNow, lastly, is Capitalism and the State intertwined? The capitalist system requires private property and scarcity of property to control the means of production and have a proletarian class to work. The police protects the \"rights\" of the bourgeois class within the capitalist system by protecting their property and their profits. This is the foundation of classical liberalism. What would happen without the police and a state defining and regulating property? Would the urban masses seize back land for their common use to survive or would their cling on ideas of property rights because some rich family that lives 10.000 km away had some paper with some bureaucrats saying they own this or that land?","created_utc":1530377319,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Jan_Janszoon","body":"\"\"If voting changed anything, they'd make it illegal.\" - Emma Goldman a famous anarchist around the time of suffrage\n\nI vote. I am an anarchist. I always vote straight democrat if possible. I voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary, voted for Barack Obama twice and Voted for John Kerry. \n\nWith voter suppression and gerrymandering and brain drain and the absurdly antiquated, archaic electoral college, not to mention the millions of felons denied their right to vote, the Republic is set up in such a way to support the ruling corporate oligarchy and maintain the status quo of corporate fascism. There are an infinite number of types of anarchists, libertarian capitalists who believe in the abolition of the nation-state and the privatization of all government services even like roads and sewer systems and anarcho-syndicalist who believe in worker-owned collectives. Anarchists traditionally don't vote. Emma Goldman did vote. You could argue voting doesn't change anything and we live in a military dictatorship which the working classes are exploited by the billionaire capitalist class. Communists like the Chinese have a very different notion of the role of government and power and who makes the decisions and anarchists believe in people power, that it is the responsibility of the people to govern themselves and decide their own fate and hope to accomplish this through grassroots revolution, strictly speaking anarchists are egalitarians like in a democracy but don't believe in the bureaucracy of the system of government like in America, but to say in a perfect world where we decide what the government will be like is a fairy tale utopia and we live in the real world. I consider myself to be an anarchist but also a progressive so I believe in direct democracy and things like weighted voting and referendums although I view direct democracy as a double-edged sword to be exploited by my sworn enemies the libertarian capitalists. I believe direct democracy is obtainable, and that has implications to municipalism and the role of the federal government. I believe that the current system of government is 'antiquated' to the point that only full-scale revolution and totally change can bring about a more harmonious existence, total disruption to the status quo. But I am a green anarchist and an environmentalist so those are my priorities. \n\nAnarchists and leftists disillusioned with the democratic party would make a formidable voting bloc if they ever got their shit together.\n\nAnarchism means direct action, civil disobedience against the government to disrupt services and injustice perpetrated by the government but this could be considered lifestyle anarchism, not to be so delusional to think we already live in a world where the government has been abolished. But in that instance anarchist believe in mutual aid like the barter system and the abolition of money and communalism and collectivism and consensus, Buenaventura Durruti said that we live in a new world in our hearts, like that Gandhi said that we must be the change we want to see in the world. \n\nI believe that the modern anarchist movement has been overrun by lifestyle anarchist and that that lifestyle anarchism, dumpster diving and hopping freight trains and squatting and starting riots and doing illegal drugs are all perfectly worthwhile pursuits in exercising our civil liberties as Americans, or agorism but what I really believe in is mutual aid networks as an anarchist, but what I am trying to say is that the anarchist movement with its punk rock and hateful self-destruction is sabotaging progressivism, channeling energy that could be spent elsewhere. Anarchism is an unbelievably diverse philosophy and if adopted by leftists could be very useful, leftism is bourgeois, is middle class, anarchists are more working class and have a greater sense of imperative, most anarchists are not non-violent and believe in systems disruption against the techno-pathocracy of technological hyper-consumerism. \n\nWe don't need a president. We don't need a government. That doesn't mean there is no government, that there is no president. \n\nAnarchists are against Zionism as a rule because Zionists are nationalistic, anarchist doesn't believe in the state or borders at all, they believe that poverty is violence and property is theft. Property in terms of land and wealth and capital and ownership so very idea of the state of Israel is absurd, that an ethnic-group could lay claim to any property for any reason is unthinkable to an anarchist, they believe in the global abolition of the nation-state however that would look like. No wars. No masters. No borders. No Gods. There are Christian anarchists and a long tradition of religious anarchism the world over but most 'anarchists' the anarchist properly don't believe in religion so the idea that the Jewish people are entitled to defend themselves by butchering the Palestinians is abhorrent. Anarchists often find themselves in solidarity with Palestinians by means of boycott, the BDS movement. Anarchist Kurds in have a nuanced approach to Israel, the Israelis support the Kurds but anarchists are in solidarity with all oppressed people. No Anarchists do not support Israel. Israel is a symbol of the Judeo-Christian dictatorship that has taken over America. They are an apocalyptic death cult.","created_utc":1530386636,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Discord_agent","body":"Obviously they play a role in violence, but how are they going to be removed from society?  There\u2019s already probably more guns than there are people in the US, so a ban on the sell of weapons won\u2019t disarm the populace that\u2019s already armed.  Criminal elements which play a decent role in gun violence will still get there weapons through the newly created black market for weapons in the event of a weapons ban because let\u2019s face it the US banning guns isn\u2019t going to stop other countries from making them.\n\nThink about who the weapons ban would affect first.  Police, or whatever firearms confiscation department is created, would target impoverished POC first, undoubtedly killing many in the process.  Once that is done they would have to go after the white fanatics, and many of these people would rather die than give them up which means more deaths from guns.  \n\nI don\u2019t really see a non-violent way to ban and confiscate weapons among the populace.","created_utc":1530401870,"score":9,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}
