You know, the ones that claim that fighting against Nazis by suckerpunching one of them is a normal way of acting. Or that that is actually self defense.\n\nSure, hitting Richard Spencer was kinda satisfying, but be honest, no one that isn't an anarchist thought \"wow what a reasonable thing to do\" after that happened. \n\nHonestly, I don't think these things are that bad. I don't condone violence usually, but especially what happened in Charlottesville, to me, is kinda fair. Especially since anarchists basically didn't do any lasting violence in the first place, but if they did, it's not really that surprising since some Nazi actually killed one of us. Regardless of that, what happened at G20 didn't look good on us. \n\nAnd that's where I'm going with this. Opinion wise I'm still a left wing anarchist, socialist libertarian, whatever you want to call it. I just don't think being needlessly violent or offensive is going to get us anywhere. That's what I'm tired off. The abuse people are giving here while crying behind \"well fuck the opressors\". \n\nSome people here are verbally abusing others. I was just called a retarded liberal, unironically. Did we just get brigaded by /r/The_Donald!? A libtard?! Come on. \n\nIt's just going to make us look stupid. Especially the thread about LGBT and their community. [Come on, just look at this link.](https://coinsh.red/p/kz.png)\n\nWithout any warning, the tone of the message. The intent of the message. The use of swear. Emoticons even. \n\nI'm not going to say \"Not all cops\" or \"not all soldiers\". I will tell any cop that the fact that they choose that job without knowing what it means to do that job is just wrong. The idea behind is just wrong, in my opinion.\n\nBut we're not going to change anyone's mind by saying \"I'm not an oil mogul you heartless fuck\". I don't even care that the person this is being said to won't change their mind. They're, in my opinion, already too far gone. Anyone reading that, however, is never going to side with an anarchist saying stuff like this.\n\nFor one, it's unreasonable. Second, it's just rude. Third, there's no arguments being made that will convince anyone. At best you'll get a \"tinfoil hat on\" kind of comment. \n\nPlease. Listen to guys like Noam Chomsky. See what he's doing. Look how he is trying to approach the population. Look how he is trying to convince people of what he believes in. This is the way to go. \n\nThere's a reason he is so polite. There's a reason why he picks his words so carefully. There's a reason for the way he tries to convince others. It's because no one is going to care about what you're saying when you're just screaming at them. It's also because being respectful to people you disagree with is important. But people who are listening to what you're saying aren't going to be convinced by you acting like an asshole.

{"author":"SmallHotdogMan","created_utc":1515652239,"num_comments":17,"score":2,"selftext":"Government was created to protect property rights. The state has always been a tool by those in socio-economic power in order to enforce violence towards those who either threaten power structure itself, power consolidation, or power growth. It is crucial to understand that the state wants to find the most efficient ways to funnel wealth back up to those in power. Feminists threaten the patriarchal power structure, hence why they are constantly demonized in the media. Minority rights activists threaten the class structure, hence why they are demonized by media, and targeted by the FBI. Green rights activists threaten the entire oil and gas industry, hence why the media paints them as crazy hippies. Communists threaten the class power structure. Anarchists threaten power itself, hence why anarchism has a bad name. It is easy to see that all struggles come back to social and economic power structures.\n\nOkay, now we need to understand that people in power do as much as they possibly can to maximize profits and biopsychosocial power(power over how others live, power over how people think, and power over how society is structured). A state will only grant us protections if they absolutely have to in order to ease public outcry, unless you have an ethical politician, but people in power do all they can to discredit and destroy them(like bernie sanders. He is demonized by the 'democratic' 'left' and the conservative right).\n\nNow that these two premises are founded, I would like to present what exactly the alt-right is for. The alt-right's core principles are anti-immigrant and anti-diversity. \n\nPeople in power love immigration. It provides far cheaper labour in developed countries. Immigrants literally built America and there is a powerful reason why, they are easy to exploit for cheap labour. We didn't start immigrating people because we morally decided it was the best, it helped industry grow exponentially. The alt-right could never ever in a thousand years stop immigration. People in power literally NEED it.\n\nPeople in power actually dislike diversity, just like the alt-right. We actually live in the Alt-right's wet dream right now, and we always have. We have racially segregated communities. We have racism psychologically and systematically imbedded in our society. We have the illusion that we have moved on since slavery, and the civil rights movement of the 50s/60s, but a lack of economic mobility and structural violence has kept minorities in disadvantageous positions just like all of history. We jail minorities extensively in order to slave them away to the private sector for usually around 20 cents an hour, hence why racial bigotry and oppression is reinforced in our justice system.\n\nMy point is, the alt-right really has no impact on current affairs. Whatever policy makes the most money for those in economic power will ALWAYS prevail, as history and economic logic has constantly proven. \n\nThis point is controversial, but I want you all to be open-minded. People in power want you all to focus on the alt-right. They understand that if they can demonize a group to take focus off the monsters of wallstreet and the state, that they can more easily get away with shitty behaviours. This has happened with antifa too! It's an easy group to focus on to take eyes off those in power. \n\nThis point is as controversial as the last one. People in power WANT you guys to incite physical violence against people VERY badly. Once they show the public that you want to incite violence on people, you will become the villian and it will be easy for the state to incite violence on you and also discredit your cause. Anarchists are the absolute biggest threat to power, hence why they need to villianize you all. \n\nI think that the argument that 'if we incite violence, less fascists will want to take action' is true; however, I dont believe that it matters wether or not they pursue their goals. The system always favours profit maximization and biopsychosocial power accumulation\n\nI am very open to discussion and I am as fallible as anyone else. Please tell your ideas and how you disagree if you do. I would love to talk about this.\n\nEdit#1:spelling","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Please Read This. Message To All Anarchists."}

Necessarily, each State exhibits this Fascism to varying extents. However, I have concluded that all States are Fascistic to some degree.\n\nIf we look at some of the symptoms of Fascist examples, we see certain consistencies and patterns of shared, general tendency. For example:\n\n* Nationalism. It is virtually impossible to think of a modern nation state that does not promote, reward and showcase nationalism. Some peoples, for many reasons, exhibit more pronounced, or more rabid acts of nationalist patriotism, but nearly all States today promote and celebrate some national identity, shared history and culture.\n\n* Corporate fusion. I know this symptom of Fascism is particularly elusive and transient. However, there are some general patterns. Though the head-of-power can take reversed roles (like the corporate control of the State we see in the West today, vs. the subduing of corporate influence under the state under Nazi Germany- of course I am simplifying), there seems to be a fusing, or perhaps, an alliance, between power interests in the State and Corporate spheres.\n\n* Exclusion. Related to nationalism, the flip side of this is always racism. This, again, exists to varying levels across societies and individuals, though there are always *us* and *them*. Everybody wants to root for their own hockey team. Some fans express more violence than others.\n\n* Militarism. Fascism has expansionist tendencies. From Mussolini, to Hitler, to the American empire and beyond, Fascism is a dominating power structure that seems to constantly expand its influence. This is the nature of (hierarchical) power structures. Not every state is in a position to exercise this aggression, but all states, with few exceptions, perhaps none, that can be attributed to magnanimity. States seeks an expansion of influence within and beyond its borders.\n\n* Dogma. Along with nationalism, there is always a (fictional) narrative surrounding the State, it's culture and history, real or imagined, that the States uses to justify and exalt it's own existence and eminence. There is almost always a process of self-victimization, coupled with the villanization of those excluded from the dominant narrative. This helps justify both the existence of the state, and any animosity or hostility it holds towards *others*.\n\nWe could elaborate further, but I think this picture seems clear enough. I was wondering what you folks think about this argument. I know most of you would agree that the State is inherently exploitative, but you concede that it is inherently Fascist as well?","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"I seem to have come to the conclusion that all States are, not just exploitative, but in their modern form, Fascist."}

Feel free to skip to the TL;DR.\n\nI've been interested in the idea of an anarchist society striving to turn as much productive activity into play as possible to make life easier for everyone.\n\nOne strategy that I've used to cope with work under capitalism is to invent little games in my head that add some fun into otherwise tedious or boring work. Capitalism creates a bunch of useless jobs that are almost impossible to make fun, but in spaces of anarchy, many of these jobs will have no reason to exist. I imagine the work leftover, that isn't automated or enjoyable on its own merits, could be made into games. Obviously, I can see \"forward-thinking\" managers under capitalism (the kind that like to call their staff \"a team\") co-opting this idea to make their workers complain less, but done in a subversive manner under the self-initiative of workers, this can be liberating. Productive activity as play is an aspect of many hunter-gatherer societies that has kept them egalitarian. \n\nOne example from my life. I taught at a democratic school, and as part of our responsibility to our community, all staff and students do a daily chore. One day, the art room was particularly messy and the poor girl who had that chore was more than a little frustrated. I told her I would help and through us talking, we (mostly her) came up with a little game:\n\nAll Out Against The Invaders of the Cleanliness-------\nAn invasion has hit planet earth! Their sole purpose is to make humans miserable by making messes! Today, they have set their sights on the art room, and have manifested themselves in something oddly similar to paint splotches. Young students had a blast providing air support with the windex and spray cleaner for a teacher with a rag.\n\nWithin minutes, a whole team of students who aren't usually excited about doing their own chore, let alone anyone else's, were enjoying cleaning the art room!\n\nI am curious to hear if any of you have found ways to turn manual labor or other not always pleasant work into play, and if you'd be willing to share your stories?\n\nTL; DR Play is liberating and, I believe, encourages people to act non-hierarchically.

They're not on Reddit but I'm sure they'd love to hear your thoughts; I'll happily pass them on. Some of the references may be unique to Australia but UrbanDictionary's got you for that.)\n\nI\u2019ve had a growing feeling of discomfort in anarchist spaces (specifically in relation to class) that I haven\u2019t been able to completely articulate - although, I think I\u2019ve recently began to boil it down to the glaring difference, at least in my mind, between being working class and being poor, and what it means to appropriate poverty.  If you\u2019re familiar with far-left political theory or have participated in the related culture then you\u2019ve probably noticed the emphasis on class politics, and born out of that is an increasing amount of working class pride the further left you go. For those of us who grew up with the culturally enforced shame of our poverty-stricken backgrounds, it\u2019s a breath of fresh air to be able to reclaim pride in that aspect of our identities. However, stemming from that pride comes an atmosphere where admitting any financial privileges is 'uncool' and taboo, which in turn encourages people to emphasise the aspects of poverty they\u2019ve experienced. I find it strange considering that these spaces encourage a huge amount of continual introspection when it comes to the privileges of sex and/or gender, ability, citizenship, race, among many other nuances, and yet conversations about financial privilege are generally relegated to the theoretical rather than the personal. \n\nLook, I\u2019m well-aware that I have a specific and perhaps even gatekeepy perspective when it comes to who did or did not grow up poor, but from where I\u2019m standing growing up in a house your parents owned in the ever-expanding housing bubble of Sydney (and places like it) is bloody incongruous with poverty, you may have been working class as fuck, but povo you were not. This all probably seems petty (perhaps it is), but the reason I think this is damaging is because by not being equally forthcoming about your financial privileges as you are your disadvantages, you\u2019re signalling to those of us who came from less that you\u2019ve suffered all the same roadblocks we have. This then only serves to make the glaring differences between our achievements and learnedness seem all the brighter, which stabs at many complexes people develop out of poverty. This is especially important because the assumed knowledge and academic nature of a lot of the discourse acts to gatekeep working class folk from engaging in the conversations and activism, thus centring the voices of the middle and upper classes. \n\nA phenomenon I\u2019ve noticed from the middle + class, is class code switching and signalling. I\u2019ve never seen a poor person do this, if anything we often feel like we stick out like a sore thumb when class crossing upwards as the imposter syndrome sets in. Middle class people, because of a socialised feeling of entitlement, are generally at ease in working class spaces (e.g. the middle-class hipsters fascination with op shopping), and this only seems to be amplified rather than subdued by an understanding of class politics. Class isn\u2019t a costume or lifestyle, it\u2019s not a choice at all. Adopting lad fashion and speaking in pig Latin is all well and good when you have the privilege of adopting any class signifier you want, but it\u2019s inauthentic as hell when you went to a private school. Appropriation only embraces the elements of marginalised cultures deemed desirable, while negating the context through which that culture was born. \n \nEven more liberal trends such as free bleeding can be a kind of spit in the face to people who haven\u2019t had the luxury of choice. Taking trendy photos of the blood dripping down your found vintage skirt as you roll a ciggie from butts you found at the station, despite being able to call your mum and ask for money at any given time (or you know, move somewhere sightly more affordable than the inner west), is both cringeworthy and insulting to those of us who have lived it for real and carry that shame. Furthermore, the conflation of poverty with a \u201ccool\u201d aesthetic is ignorant of the fact that there are actual social repercussions and disadvantages inherent to being born into a lower class. It\u2019s ironic that the circles that centre class politics are reluctant to cater to the various tendencies inherent to such a background. Damo probably doesn\u2019t have the time or energy to spend keeping up to date on this week\u2019s idpol trends which are often a touch too condescending to be digestible to his demographic. \n \nThis isn\u2019t to say that the experiences of poverty that the aforementioned groups have lived aren\u2019t real or valid; they are. Rather, it\u2019s that they should be just as forthcoming about the financial privileges they\u2019ve benefited from, and that more works is needed from them in order to continually break down class barriers within leftist discourse and activism so we can collectively avoid centring the voices of those that \u2018have\u2019, over those who \u2018have not\u2019.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"The Far-Left and Poverty Appropriation/Tourism"}

The former proletarians are not producing value anymore, according to the LTV.

Then I adopted the oldest diet of all, the diet our indigenous ancestors ate for about 3 million years of evolution: fruits, non-starchy vegetables, nuts and seeds, lean meats and seafood (grass fed, free range, etc), but no grains or legumes or diary, no sugars, no juices, no potatoes, no starchy foods.\n\nThe result within about two weeks: lower cholesterol; consistent, easily sustainable loss of excess weight; well-regulated blood sugar; lower blood pressure; clearer thought processes; increased focus; an end to the constant headaches; the permanent end to the painful inflammation in my knee... in short a far better health profile in all metrics.\n\nSo... while I have been an anarchist for about a decade I may not fit in with today's notions of \"lifestyle anarchism\" and any anarchist who tries to force me to go against my DNA and my evolutionary diet, to conform into their anti-science and their personal dietary choices is no anarchist, but quite authoritarian. We evolved for three million years eating fruits, vegetables, and lean meats. Fighting evolution is what religion teaches. The advent of agrarianism (the agricultural revolution) 10,000 years ago led to division of labor, technology, deforestation, and the resulting climate change that is now causing the 6th mass extinction. At this juncture the only thing that will save us and the biosphere is some sort of technology that will take carbon out of the atmosphere, along with severely curtailing carbon emissions. Ending consumption of cows is fine if that helps, but there are other forms of meat one can eat.\n\nBut one thing is clear: it wasn't eating meat that got us here, but rather it was clearing forests for grains and legumes, and the resulting overpopulation and all that comes with it. The agricultural revolution led us to this horrible outcome. Our time here may be over in just a couple of decades.\n\nThere are thousands and thousands of species that consume animals. Even some plants trap insects for food. To stop all of that consumption (so-called \"speciesism\") would cause the eco-system to collapse. I didn't design the earth's biosphere: evolution and natural selection did that. I wasn't asked for an opinion before I was born. I wish I could wave a wand and remake the universe according to a different design, but I'm not god and nor is anyone else. The cosmos sprang into its existence from the big bang and here we are, warts and all, in this stunningly beautiful but often tragic and appalling universe. My body thrives when I eat according to evolutionary requirements. I get sick when I don't.\n\nImagine some well-meaning but horribly misguided \"anarchists\" going into a hunter-gatherer, pre-agriculteral society or tribe and forcing them under the excuse of \"anarchism\" to eat according to veganism. This culture would have to start clearing trees to create space for enough crops to sustain themselves. This itself causes more carbon to enter the atmosphere (plants that dry up once uprooted release carbon). It also reduces the vegetation that captures and sequesters carbon. That of course is a form of imposing a culture upon an entire society. It is in fact a kind of privilege of a dominant agrarian culture. It is arrogance of a smug intellectual class that determines for the rest, from on high, from above, how people at the \"bottom\" should live their lives, as if so morally superior the so-called \"primitives\" don't have a right to self-determination.\n\nI'm not an anarcho-primitivist, nor am I strongly anti-civ (but I have leanings), because the cat of agrarianism and technology is already out of the bag and isn't likely to return, barring total collapse of modern global society. But we can learn a great deal from these early cultures, and we have largely lost our way with the path humans have taken, leading inexorably in the next three decades (i.e., sooner than people realize) to our own self-destruction.\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"I was vegan for 33 years... before most here were born, very likely"}

But how can America be land of the free and simultaneously have the highest incarceration rate, and most prisoners worldwide? How can america be the home of the brave when the people chosen to protect it are in constant fear for their lives?\n\n   The firsr question is, when was the term \"*land of the free, home of the brave*\" first coined? Well, the Star Spangled Banner comes from a poem written by Francis Key in 1814. Maybe Francis forgot about the entire slave population when he wrote the line \"land of the free\"?\n\n   Even after the Emancipation Proclamation, African Americans Face discrimination and are incarcerated at more that 5 times the rate of whites. There has to be a reason for this, right? Well, according to the 13th amendment, \"Section 1. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, *except as punishment of a crime* whereof the party shall have been duly convicted...\" in other words, slaver is still legal so long as  someone has been convicted. And who better to target than african americans?\n\n   America only represents around 4.4% of the worlds population, yet houses around 22% of the worlds inmates. So how can the \"land of the free\" have the most un-free people? The answer is simple: it cant. The US is not, and has never been the land of the free.\n\n   But what about America being the \"home of the brave\"? The police in America certainly do not seem brave. They have body armor, state backing, tasers, guns, bloodhounds, armored vehicles, and chemical weapons, yet still claim to be in fear for their lives when facing unarmed citizens! There has to be a reason for this, right? Well, there is a reason the police make this claim so much. When the police use fear as an excuse, that \"justifies\" their actions in the eyes of the state. Police apologists will claim that it is a stressful job, or that the police are putting their lives on the line.\n\n   But according to the US Department of Labor, workplace fatality rates for fishermen, loggers, pilots, garbage collectors, iron and steel workers, roofers, among others are all highers than that of the police. But we dont see pilots going around killing people and using fear as an excuse, do we?\n\n   To conclude, Americas prison system is just a front to get unpaid labor, and the police dont protect, but rather terrorize the citizens. These are the dystopian realities of many, and the only way to break free from this man made hell is if we, the people, demand freedom by any means necessary.","subreddit":"AnarchismBookClub","title":"\"Land of the free, Home of the Brave\"""num_comments":0,"score":2,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"\"Land of the free, Home of the Brave\""}

I cannot tell you how many poor people often scoff at the rich business owners because they are just lucky to have been born from wealthy parents. Hell I even see middle class people who are well off attacking the Bill Gates and other successes as lazy imbeciles who are just \"sitting on their butts all day long\" and they are hoarding wealth so it should be distributed.  I seen from the general populace, both poor and middle class, attack the capitalist system because business men aren't really doing hardwork nor are they producing anything of value.\n\nI will admit just for the sake of what I will say in a minute that I am not a conservative. I've been raised in a minarchist household that favors neither leftist nor rightest view but merely view government should have minimal interaction in everything from what movies you watch to visiting a brothel to AK47 owndership. So yes I already have views that are contradictory to conservative idealism.\n\nYet I could never understand the criticism \"business men are lazy because they inherited their richness\" and \"running a business is as easy as 123!\". Even before I started going into the stock market, I already had first hand experience of how running a business would be like via stays at my auntie (who I mentioned in one of the above reddit links, owns a restaurant). In addition to seeing the dangers and difficulties of kitchen cookings, everytime I stayed over I would always hear her at night getting enraged as she spoke on the phone as she was speaking with employees, partners, and other business associates about so many complex subjects such as paying the bills, trying to get a new insurance company's support, difficulties with kitchen equipment, etc. I could always see how stressed my auntie would be everytime she woke up before she drank coffee and took a bath.\n\nMind you my auntie is actually quite a successful business owner. At the time she already had a $1,000,000 (I was 14 when she had that amount) in one of her bank accounts and when I talked to her which was weeks before I tried to get into stocks and bonds recently, she told me she had amassed a little over $10 million in that specific bank account. This is not counting assets, her other bank account savings, etc. But I can see despite being merely 46, she's already full of gray hair (I'm only 22 just to put this into perspective).\n\nSo I was not naive to believe I'll get rich quick when I tried to enter stock market recently as I already know first hand how hard business can be. Yet even I was caught off guard at how simplistic stuff such as comparing different stocks in chart analysis could be.\n\nSo it makes me wonder why the politically left and anarchist as well as poor and many middle class people think running a business and investments is a cakewake? And why many of them think just because Trump was given a lot of cash to start business  by his already rich dad that it was easy as playing video games for him to run his enterprises?\n\nI mean has any one seen how Tom Kalinske left his job as CEO of Sega of America with grey hair just because the stress of company politics got him? Or how medical analysts are saying Steve Jobs had a relatively young death because of his diseases which they theorized was probably caused by being overworked running Apple?\n\nI would like your input anarchists!","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"HOW LEGIT IS THE CRITICISM THAT MANY CURRENT SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMEN AND INVESTORS INHERITED THEIR WEALTH AND/OR COMPANY OR CAME FROM EDUCATED MIDDLE CLASS?

The debate was; if I understood correctly was Chelsea was running to end corporate power and the rich people who run them from influencing the government: a good goal because faceless institutions that exist for profit exercising power over the people is obviously antithetical to anarchism and the problem people had with her and her supporters was that by participating in the institution of government, you were by definition no longer an anarchist and basically it didn\u2019t belong in this sub at best.  I totally get that and semantically it\u2019s 100% correct, in a sense it\u2019s like calling black white.  \n\n But then I wonder if it\u2019s really so black and white.  If there really is a difference between short term and long term goals because long term goals don\u2019t just happen!  They are composed of a bunch of short term goals!    Yes I understand that it would basically be trading in your identity as an anarchist technically supporting a government candidate who is trying to give power from corporations back to the people, but what other means do we have?  \n\n\nI ask this because anarchism is based on voluntary participation.  My only other answer is quite literally physically dismantle the institutions that rule us, but institutions are made of people and isn\u2019t violence even property violonce if done on a massive scale that dismantling the institutions would require: isnt that also antithetical to anarchism because it\u2019s not based on voluntary participation in an anarchistic world?  Wouldn\u2019t we by definition forcing people into our belief system?  That\u2019s not voluntary!\n\nBefore you start replying let me finish my thought please:\n\nFreedom from all systems.  It\u2019s sounds great.  In my ideal world, stateless, small non hierarchical free association  institutions based on voluntary participation sounds like the way to go. \n\nBut how exactly do we plan on getting there? Can we even \u201cplan\u201d such a society at all if it\u2019s all based on voluntary participation?   \n\nThen there\u2019s the nature of power.   How can you get the state and the corporation and the mega rich people that own both to voluntarily give up their power.  It seems fanciful!   \n\nThen there\u2019s realpolitik, which idk, you may or not believe in, and it\u2019s not a perfect way to explain all interactions but I believe it can explain many.  State power doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum.   Not only are other states constantly trying to lower the others power in an attempt to gain power in the vacuum.  But  the bigger problem I honestly see going into the 21rst century are the power of international corporations.  I also believe, that while in in many instances, the states and the corporations power are obviously intricately intertwined, at the same time they are at odds with each other.\n\n\nPower doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum.  I admit this may not be a perfect idea: like I said, my ideas are obviously still forming and I\u2019d just like some feedback.  If we take the word and say x amount of power exists, then removing power from the government means that corporations will take that power.  Anyways, there\u2019s a saying I like: deregulation only means regulation by corporation.  Corporations use their power(money in this case) to remove regulations on the environment, giving the corporation power to salt the earth for profit at the expense of the common man.   Government regulations after union strikes are what led to an end of 6-7 day work weeks, child labor, no minimum wage,unsafe workplaces etc etc through laws passed and enforced by the state.  I mean that\u2019s just two examples of many.\n\nHow can we forever absolve both at that same time and then prevent such entities from forming again in a completely voluntary system?\n\n\nI guess one of my questions is, if the system is voluntary, what entity would exist that would prevent corporations and the rich from colluding at the expense of the worker.  Sure all establishments have been smashed in this example.  But what exists to prevent new establishments from doing the exact same thing?  If said anarchy is established on a state by state basis, what is stopping g the corporation from its exercising power in the next state over?  In such a global world  the global corporate takeover seems inevitable in a world where the corporation is unchecked.\n\n\n\nI suppose you could sum in up as a prisoners dilemma/chicken before the egg before the chicken type deal.  I for example most people can be counted on as good trusting people in an environment of mutual gain and respect.  Hunter gatherer societies prove this.  But all it takes is a few bad apples to take the small nonheirarcheil groups to create a large heirarcheil group that can exercise power.  And if all the small groups banded together to counter the power; then wouldn\u2019t that become a new institution which is antithetical to our ideals?\n\n\nSo yeah, based on my name, I want an end to neoliberalism.   The corporations and the rich controlling the government.  Could I be accused of using anarchy as a means to an end and not being a purist, or even technically an anarchist?

[It's of a book by Karl Hess called Community Technology.](https://ozarkvoluntaryists.org/book-review-community-technology/)\n\nHess calls, in his book, for people to form local community institutions based around principles of direct democracy and voluntary association. He wanted organizations to be structured in such a way that people have a genuine voice, advocating horizontal structures over the representative democracy of the existing government, and direct action over trying to change the State.\n\nHe also argues, and provides evidence, that decentralization of the economy is possible, with neighborhoods and communities relying on local institutions and not needing to be dependent on outsiders to take care of them. Thus, he argues that local communities need not submit to the power or authority of centralized institutions, whether they be governments or corporations.\n\nI think anarchists will have excellent reason to find and read his book. He mentions Peter Kropotkin and his work on decentralism, but for most of the book he talks in terms of direct democracy and community groups rather than explicitly using the word \"anarchy.\" He also avoids the term \"socialism,\" as a descriptor for the institutions he advocates for, even when he praises the successes of worker-owned and managed organizations. But the terminology is less important to me. He defends the philosophy and gives evidence that people can work together without authority structures or centralized control, and that people can meet their own needs well enough that they can be practically free from bosses, governors, bureaucrats, and all the rest.\n\nAnyway, I hope you like my review and read his book.","subreddit":"AnarchismOnline","title":"Book Review: Community Technology by Karl Hess""num_comments":0,"score":4,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Book Review: Community Technology by Karl Hess"}

And when I hear people preaching about the merits of eating vegan I'm just like, \"where do you get the time to care about this?\"\n\nAnd I kind of get it, because I do care about animals rights. I know where I stand on the issue, but I just do not have the time or energy to give a shit where the free chicken i ate comes from. And it's pretty shitty that so many vegans just don't care about humans as much as they do animals and they kind of remind me of liberals in that respect. Like they think humans have some sort of moral responsibility for their horrifying lives.\n\n\nedit- wow. im getting a lot of really shitty insensitive comments and most of you are completely missing my point. My point is that a lot of vegans lack intersectionality and don't seem to give a shit about human suffering. Thanks for proving my point, i guess?\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"My bone to pick with vegans."}

Early 2017 saw many struggles won for the fascists. But the anarchist reaction to it grew. \n\nAfter being beaten mercilessly into late 2017, with disenfranchised right wing men leaving disgruntled, *Charolettesville changed everything.*\n\nAfterwards, infighting ripped apart the previously solid \"Alt-Right.\" Oathkeepers and III%ers vowed to \"stand down\" and never again defend explicitly racist groups and organization. Alt-Right fascists snitch-jacketed each other into profound organizational distrust.\n\nDoxxing of thousands of fascists ripped apart much of the organizing effort. Fascists became scared to attend explicit rallies. \n\nAnarchists were ready more for a fight following Charolettesville than ever before. But their worst enemy has successfully been pushed to the fringe...for now.\n\n**WE STAND AT A CROSSROADS**\n\nThe need for anti-fascist organizing will likely not cease. But we stand at a time where we need to **diversify our struggles and strategies.**\n\n**WHAT NEW STRATEGIES TO LOOK TOWARD**\n\n**Ecology:** we need to stand in opposition to the imminent threat posed by capital. We need to contrast with the reactionary liberalism of orgs like the Democrats, Greenpeace, and the Sierra Club *which wish to strike a bargain between capital and the environment.*\n\nWe can radically bring the fight to save our environment, the key is to start now. Fight pipelines, fight logging. [Start here](http://earthfirstjournal.org/)\n\n**Liberation from Oppressive Gendered Social Relations:** we need to stand against the bigotry of the Right against non-male, non-cis, non-\"straight\" communities. \n\nWe need to contrast with reactionary liberal feminism which seeks to maintain Gendered Social Relations and stuff trans and intersex people into feminine/masculine social relations. These oppressive social relations, along with gender, must be abolished.\n\n**Anti-State/Anti-Cop:** knowledge is power. Building trust and power with communities targeted by ICE and Cops will build the movement. Spread security culture, feed the homeless, start a **Food Not Bombs** chapter, spread zines and posters. Don't talk to cops.\n\n**Animal Liberation:** capital has turned our fellow creatures into commodities, much like ourselves. The oppression that our fellow creatures face, however, can be just as strong, if not stronger than that which we face.\n\nTurning animals into commodities isn't the fault of non-vegan consumers, it's the fault of capital. We need to fight for radical answers in the face of reactionary liberalism of organizations like PETA who believe we can fix this by purchasing differently and maintaining capital.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Moving Past Antifa: Struggles Ahead"}

The following day warden Barry Reddish retaliated against Kevin\u2019s use of his First Amendment rights, ordering that he be given a disciplinary infraction for \u201cinciting a riot\u201d. Further, on January 19th Johnson was thrown in a cold cell, with a broken toilet, no heating, and with a window that will not fully close, allowing cold wind to blow into the cell. The cell has the same temperature as the outside, where temperatures have been repeatedly at or below freezing. We have not heard anything from Kevin since January 19th . Warden Barry Reddish must be held accountable for illegal retaliation and, now, the torture of Kevin \u201cRashid\u201d Johnson.\n\nWe demand that Johnson is moved to a safe and clean cell, with normal indoor temperatures and with a toilet that works. We demand that Johnson be allowed to call his attorneys immediately.

Please use these facts for twitter, FB, social media and, since it appears White House phone lines are currently cut off due to the government \"shutdown\", to write op-eds to your local paper: \n\n- 72 planes flying over Afrin and bombing civilian areas indiscriminately. \n- 2 tanks captured. \n- Terrorists captured speak only Turkish and report they have come to kill all the Kurds. \n- Casualties on both sides \n- Russian forces have withdrawn from Afrin in a move to allow Turkey to directly free reign. \n- Turkey is busing in thousands of terrorists to Afrin and imposing a complete blockade.\n- There is an urgent need for a press campaign: \n\n\"Share the voices coming out of Afrin and Rojava. Speak, share, post, write. Write to your MPs and senators and demand an immediate response to Erdogan's terrorism. Write to your local papers and demand more attention on the plight of the Kurds and other innocent civilians and ethnoreligious groups living in Afrin. Flood social media and make them listen to the voices and the people who stood up against ISIS and humanity and freedom when no one else had the courage or the will.\"\n\nHere is her original message posted to Facebook an hour ago:\n\n\n ****URGENT news from Afrin, Rojava***\nIn the last hour Erdogan's air force attacked and bombarded Afrin. Hevals noted over 72 planes flying over Afrin and bombing indiscriminately. Hevals also confirm that direct conflict with Turkish backed terrorist groups have occurred. Two tanks have been captured by the SDF/YPG/YPJ and many killed and captured from the terrorist groups; but there are a number of injured and martyred on our side too.\nFor well over two years Erdogan's planes have bombarded Afrin provinces, dozens of villages have been destroyed with even more innocent civilian massacred. For weeks now Erdogan has threatened to attack Afrin, and it has finally taken the step to wage a direct war with the SDF/YPG/YPJ forces. Reports confirm that Russian forces have withdrawn from Afrin in a move to allow Turkey to directly free reign. Reports also confirm that Turkey has bused in thousands of terrorist groups to surrender Afrin and impose a complete blockade. It is crucial to remember that Turkey has attacked the center of the city- a direct attack against innocent civlians. An unknown number at this stage have been injured and killed.\nIn Kobane morale is high. We are cheering on our heroes with great confidence; and we believe that against all odds, against NATO's second largest military, against the planes bombarding, against all reason and all logic that the heart of Rojava- its democratic and gender empowering soul- will succeed; as we did just three years ago with Kobane.\nFor Kurds this is a particularly painful and traumatic time as we face another 'Kobane'. But this is not a time to panic. This is not a time to be overwhelmed with the gravity of yet another unwanted war at our doorsteps. This is a time to remember the immensity and the ground breaking courage that shook the world with the force of 10 Richter magnitude scale just three years ago. It is time to remember that our young women withstood the barrage of onslaught of thousands of ISIS fighters armed with the best looted and supplied heavy weaponry- as they liberated thousands of Yezidi women and girls enslaved and smashed patriarchy. It is time to remember the Arin's and Dastina's and Zilan's. It is time to remember that there are families here in Kobane alone that have over 17 martyrs- reinforcing the idea that we will do anything, at any cost to defend Kurdistan, defend freedom, defend democracy and all that is sacred in a world torn apart by fascism, capitalism, terrorism. It is time for courage, self belief, unity and strength. It is a time of an unshakable belief in the success of the Revolution of Rojava and the young women and men who stand between us and the tanks and the planes of the petrified enemy.\nBut this is also a time for action.

The problem is I am opposed to exploitation, and so I must be opposed to taxation (right?), but many ancoms and other anarcho-syndicalists perceive me as a right winger because of this.

But obviously I couldn't just leave her out on the street, so we drove her to an area she was safe and familiar with and I just kinda let her shoot up in my car because I had no idea what else to do.  In hindsight, I very easily could have gotten stopped by a cop and we would have been so screwed.\n\nThis made me realize though that I'm putting myself in at least a little bit of danger every time I let a stranger into my space, whether legal or physical, and I'm a tiny 19 year old with no ability to fight or anything like that and no experience in the criminal justice system.\n\nHow does everyone else here approach keeping themselves safe when it comes to situations like this?

{"author":"kevinfat2","created_utc":1517302177,"num_comments":21,"score":8,"selftext":"Sorry for this big rant but I have no idea what the hell else subreddit would even be relateable to his. I am a software engineer and everyday I come home feeling frustrated with the long day. Yes the work is boring (boring relative to me not for everyone else I'm sure) but I feel like the real problem isn't that it was boring its that I'm mostly glued to this monitor all day long without any of my friends. Its hard to explain its like how homework is so fucking boring and easy if you're doing it alone but with your friends during a sleep over it feels different. The problem now is like my friends feel kind of boring except for like 2. For example, one friend from university use to be really interested in various stuff in computer science and talking to him about that stuff was engaging. Now he is a bore who just plays street fighter 5 which is kind of interesting because he sold his startup and is now a millionaire and could do anything creative. But instead what I see is he getting married after dating a girl for only one and a half years. I haven't told him how dumb of an idea it is to have a BMW and Model S and be picking this girl up for dates and now be marrying her after just one and a half years because there is ZERO chance she cares about him (he is fat and bald). But what is even more fucked up is that because I've known this dude from junior high he tells me stuff like he'll occasionally get depressed. Here I'm thinking WTF you're a millionaire and you get depressed???????? Then I'm putting two and two together and thinking he feels kind of lonely which makes sense for him getting in a rush to get married. He has lots of friends but I mean lonely in the special connection type of sense if that makes any sense. I'm an anarchist he considers himself a liberal but he dismisses the likes of Noam Chomsky can't be bothered to read any of it. We are just different after growing up. So even though we've known each other for a long time we aren't best buddies anymore.\n\nBut anyways after that long tangent I just find adult work life SUCKS shit. Again software development is probably a lot less boring as fuck compared to other occupations. And moreover the pay is way better my salary is $120,000 not counting other stock compensations. I use to work at Google. Now I hear what you're thinking \"dude this guy is talking like first world problems he is doing WAY better than most everyone else and here he is complaining\". I'm gonna straight up admit that I feel frustrated. With my friends I use to play tennis, piano, make video games, play made up games, joke a bunch. Now it feels like everyone is like personality different including me. Its like the 9 to 5 grind changes you in subtle ways or something. Its like everything has to have a career networking monetary return on investment or its a worthless social activity.\n\nYet at work I see some people joking and seem super happy somehow. I don't understand how that is possible. The ones that are married I can sort of get it because at least they have someone to come home to. But like if you listen to their conversations at lunch time its the most generic fluff void of any interesting creative content. I use to have a lot of interesting conversation in university which of course had to do with the context of taking courses. Now at lunch time I have absolutely no idea what the fuck to talk about with anyone except uh like you know that tv show or something uh whatever. Some people seem to have this magical ability to converse without having done anything creative. Of course the 9 to 5 grind makes it near impossible to be creative. I have literally no friend to learn stuff with. I find if I try to learn stuff by myself I never make it which makes sense that we are social creatures.\n\nMy current goal is to make my own software as a service small business. Now I know this isn't going to solve things totally because even if I can successfully get my own business so I don't feel like a worker drone I'll be like ok who the hell do I spend my time with creatively? Like who do you know doesn't become less creative after university? I don't know if like anything I'm typing here rings a bell with anyone else? Like I sort of realized not to try to aim for this social status prestige stuff that is common in the tech industry because I realize its really an underlying feeling of creative social connection sort of like with what Sut Jhally has said about advertisement and friendship. But dude adult 9 to 5 work life SUCKS shit. I guess my problem is like my expectations are way too high. Like my expectations for my best buddy friendships where we are like we are in this life together against all the corporate powers etc is unrealistic because that isn't gonna happen with your friends after university. Ugh thanks guys for listening.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Why do some people seem to enjoy working 9 to 5?"}

I live in a big US city with a diverse population and active antifa presence. We also have a very active and very violent neo-Nazi network in the area, and they have a history of assault, intimidation, and attempted murder of antifascists in this city. I have two warnings for our American comrades in particular:\n\nFirst, the far-right is watching you. The far-right has no qualms about attacking you, especially if they know where and when you get off the bus, where your house is, where you work, etc. It is too easy for any one of the 50 people on that bus to make a note of you, take your photo, follow you home, and doxx you. They could be alt-right, regular MAGA Republicans, or genuine neo-Nazis. PLEASE BE CAREFUL. Read the AFA Handbook at home and keep yourself safe. Practice good opsec. Especially now that the right knows to look for antifa activists, you have to be careful.\n\nSecond, be wary of people who might be trying to trap you or infiltrate you. If you don\u2019t know someone, and they start asking weird questions about antifa or protests or meeting places, they might be a cop, a snitch, or a fash trying to infiltrate your org or doxx you. Just be aware of that kind of thing. I\u2019m not saying the person reading the AFA Handbook on the bus was trying to honeypot anyone, it\u2019s more likely they\u2019re just a little naive, but it\u2019s certainly possible.\n\nBe careful and stay safe, comrades.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Warning to comrades openly participating in antifascist activities \u2014 you are being watched"}
