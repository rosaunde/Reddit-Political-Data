My friend who was a staunch conservative has recently become what he says is an anarchist. He doesn't care about unions or government or anything, he just uses the word as a way to rebel against his parents, and generally be a giant dick. This has evolved to him being publicly indecent (yelling, making a disruption, taking up a whole row on the train, running over roads etc) and it's becoming very concerning. He doesn't listen to his mother or anyone, how do I educate him on what anarchism actually is and get him to stop being such a giant dick?\n\nThanks comrades\n\nSide note: The problem is I'm afraid that he'll spill to his mom that he is an anarchist because of me.

The answer is that popular gun ownership is an essential part of revolutionary praxis, for reasons of power and morality. Many prominent figures on the American social democratic left view guns as useless since the US government is \u201cobviously\u201d too powerful to be fought by \u201cpeople with rifles.\u201d This is to some degree a straw man argument. More importantly it misses the point. If anything, widespread gun ownership is probably most significant in the aftermath of a revolutionary moment.\n\nFirst, though, let\u2019s dispose of the social democratic straw man, the assertion that the American bourgeois state is simply too powerful to be opposed by some gun owning yahoos. This argument elides the entire history of left struggle in the United States. From labor organizers in the 19th and early 20th century, through the Civl Rights Movement of the 1950s/1960s, organizers have faced threats from capitalist oligarchs and white supremacists. In labor struggles, bosses constantly hired goons to beat up workers and attack labor organizers. Walter Reuther, of the UAW survived two assassination attempts, and subsequently had armed security. He is hardly the only one, as countless unknown workers repelled attacks from Pinkertons and other capitalist goons. Today this history is almost lost, as complacent union bureaucrats tremble at anything that might even have the flavor of a Taft-Hartley violation. \n\nIn current historical memory of the Civil Rights Movement, the role of organized self-protection units is similarly missing. This seems more intentional, as the centrist Democrats and Republicans have co-opted Martin Luther King\u2019s memory to stand for boring, yearly commemorations that whitewash Dr. King\u2019s socialist beliefs in full employment and opposition to America\u2019s war in Vietnam. Factually, SNCC\u2019s organizers in the rural South depended on armed volunteers to protect them from marauding bands of white citizens. The idea that SNCC organizers could have depended on the police to protect them is laughable when the police were literally Klan leaders in many towns. Charles Cobb, a participant in SNCC and later a respected journalist with National Geographic has written about this in his book _This Non-Violence Stuff\u2019ll Get You Killed_. Outside of SNCC, Robert and Mabel Williams carried out armed self-protection during their efforts to integrate Monroe, Alabama. Their organization, The Black Armed Guard also protected Freedom Riders during the early 1960s. \n\nMany American social democrats conflate armed self-defense with armed struggle. By blurring these lines they are able to tar every leftist gun use with the failure of the ultra-left adventurists of the Weather Underground and SLA in the 1970s. It is very dishonest and historically inaccurate to do so because it erases the significant contributions of armed self-protection to labor and civil rights struggles. With the current resurgence of fascist organizing, many people have begun to revive the tradition of armed self-protection, indeed, without it how else can one organize in areas dominated by conservative forces often sympathetic to fascists? To do so without the ability to exercise armed self-defense is completely ignorant and ignores the integral part that such armed self-defense played in the last upsurge of significant left gains during the 1960s. \n\nThe wholesale  collapse of abortion availability in the South and Midwest should be a cautionary tale of the power of right wing terrorism. Despite the court room victories of the reproductive rights community, and their overall hegemony within academia, it is all for nought. Right wing terrorists have denied working class women in places like Mississippi access to reproductive health by killing abortion providers, while the organized social democratic/liberal left fled to the coasts and reveled in their moral superiority. \u201cReproductive rights\u201d won in a courtroom mean nothing if people cannot enforce them, and in areas where the security services and state are overwhelmingly opposed to those rights, the rights effectively do not exist. This is bad praxis and morally indefensible because it directly hurts working class women of color the most.\n\nTechnocratic liberals can wave around studies talking about how \u201cgun owners are more likely to be killed than non-gun owners,\u201d and this is missing the point. Even if we take accept studies at face value, it should be completely obvious that reproductive rights workers or radical leftists in conservative areas face dramatically heightened threats compared to the \u201caverage person.\u201d\n\nArmed self-defense in the struggle aside, it is actually after a revolutionary victory that leftists face the greatest dangers, both from the oligarchy and from each other. Revolutionary victory can look like a number of things. The classic one is the moment where a state fails in the face of insurrection, like, Iran in  1979, or Egypt in 2011. In such a moment, it can be certain that former regime security services will make a play for power, as will right wing religious sects. Unarmed and unorganized leftists will be wholly unable to protect themselves and organize. In Iran and Egypt, the left was unable to protect itself. In the case of Egypt, there were a lot of nice liberals with social media accounts\u2026but none of them could protect organizers on the ground from right wing assaults.  Yes, there were soccer fan clubs, Ultras, that organized to protect revolutionaries, but this was inadequate and not really a substitue for a weapons bearing culture on the left. Right wing forces (former state security and right sectarian alike) launched routine  attacks on the the left, and we all know how that ended \u2014 with right wing victories. \n\nThere is another kind of revolutionary victory that seems more likely in the United States, that of an electoral victory. Since 2016, socialist candidates have exploded onto the scene at all levels. It seems plausible that some kinds of social democratic programs could win major victories \u2014 things like Medicare for All, Universal Basic Income, a Jobs Guarantee, and breaking up corporate monopolies are no longer taboo for elected officials and those seeking office. One or more of these programs could make it through Congress. If history is any guide, the capitalist class views socialists who win at the ballot box as an existential threat.  The best example is Allende\u2019s election in  Chile.\n\nSalvador Allende, a socialist pacifist, became president of Chile in 1970. After he moved decisively to threaten the interests of capitalists who commanded the heights of the Chilean economy, they cooperated with the US government to foment unrest. Fidel Castro warned Allende of what was coming, and encouraged him to distribute weapons to his followers. As a lifelong pacifist, Allende refused. The coup came in 1973, and the Pinochet regime that followed spared no expense in murdering leftists, who almost wholly lacked the means to resist thanks to Allende\u2019s delusional beliefs. \n\nUS-based leftists are foolish if they think that socialist wins at the ballot box would not see a sharp response from the right, from terrorist attacks against socialist organizers up to and including a coup. The history of the left in the 20th Century is a history of state socialist forces choosing to suppress right wing counterrevolutionaries by the establishment of all-powerful security services, from the Soviet Cheka to the Cuban DGI. Such a path is antithetical to truly democratic practice and one that most leftists today reject. The actually existing practice of state socialism in the Soviet Bloc made a mockery of the idea of a worker militia, as the \u201cmilitsiya\u201d were controlled by the heavy hands of the Center and not by the workers themselves. \n\nIf we are going to reject anti-democratic practice then we have no choice but to accept that popular gun ownership and revolutionary self-protection is the alternative to state-sponsored counterrevolutionary madness. For the small number of you who are still die-hard apologists for Stalin, you must know that even in the case of a revolutionary insurrection, you can\u2019t be guaranteed that your faction will prevail. Given such uncertainty, why would you support policies that would make you vulnerable to other factions? \n\nAs socialists, we generally agree that the means of production should be controlled by a wide swathe of the population, instead of concentrated in the control of a tiny capitalist class.  All societies wield violence in some way, and guns are the means of production for violence. Therefore, we should ensure that control of those guns is in the hands of ordinary people, in much the same way that we demand worker control of factories and workplaces. \n\nMoreover, from a dialectical materialist perspective, taking guns out of popular hands breeds compliance and subservience.. How could it not? When people are denied the ability to exercise violence  they surrender the protection of their physical integrity to others. Such a material circumstance must necessarily change their subjectivity, as they must now reconcile their basic helplessness by embracing the people who wield violence \u201con their behalf,\u201d in other words, their masters. One have only to look at the wholly servile social democratic parties of Western Europe, and even some still calling themselves Communists, to see the profoundly deradicalizing effect of accepting civilian disarmament as \u201ccivilized.\u201d In the United States, it is no accident that the almost wholly disarmed  professional class liberals of the Northeast corridor worship authority and the security services. By disarming the populace in the urban Northeast corridor, the American elite have created a material environment that assists them in building, reproducing, and  valorizing a subservient subjectivity among the professional class that keeps the elite in power. Disarmed people who believe in the morality of their vulnerability have no power, which is precisely what the ruling class wants. \n\nAs leftists, we must resolutely oppose gun control as it reproduces the material environment of subservience to the ruling class. \n\nIn addition, under our current bourgeois liberal democratic government, gun control laws will inevitably strengthen the hand of the ruling class. As Marx taught us, \u2018\u2019[t]he executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.\u201d In the US that means the rule of white settler colonialism. Any gun control laws implemented will be implemented just like the \u201cWar on Drugs,\u201d with working class people  generally as the primary targets of enforcement. This is just how the system works. Stop and frisk policies in many cities were justified on the basis of finding guns, and a nationwide firearms confiscation program will be the perfect excuse for white supremacist security forces to yet again put working class people of color in the crosshairs. The students protesting for gun control are without a doubt well intentioned and passionate in their cause. They are also deeply misguided because the policies they advocate will only increase the power of the ruling class to hurt working people, a ruling class that is currently strangling the planet. \n\nFor socialists, this puts us into a terrible bind, as public school killings have become omnipresent in the media environment, thanks to the neuroses of professional class liberals in the elite broadcast media. Asking for more police in schools inevitably means more children thrown into the hungry mouth of the white supremacist \u201cjustice\u201d system. Broward County actually made efforts to reduce teen incarceration and suspensions, which was the subject of a 2013 article in the American Prospect, a left leaning magazine. It seems not unlikely that such programs contributed to the lack of law enforcement response to the shooter, even after he had been suspended from school and displayed many warning signs. This is the heart of the crisis of American capitalism.  If we advocate for programs that loosen police powers , we make society more vulnerable to people like the Broward school shooter. But if we advocate for more police enforcement powers we surely will increase the number of working class people of color who are victimized by state violence. \n\nLoosening police powers is something that we as socialists need to think very carefully about. As socialists we must be honest with people. It is doubtlessly true that removing policing from a populace deeply wounded by capitalism will expose many people to serious risk. \n\nIn the case of a general insurrection, it seems likely that the police will retreat momentarily. In such a moment, the prisons will open and many incarcerated people will finally live in freedom. This is a wonderful thing \u2014 however, we also know that many of these people have long been brutalized by capitalism.  As quickly as we may seek to implement caring programs, there are a couple of problems. One, standing up such programs takes time. Second, there are going to be some people who are beyond help. Therefore, citizens must have the means to protect ourselves from those whom we cannot, for whatever reason, reach in time with caring programs. Additionally, we will have to deal with countless numbers of former corrections officers and other former regime enforcers. Many of these people are also traumatized by their experiences and will have a difficult time fitting into a new socialist society. \n\nWe can expect, if the historical example of the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s is any guide, that many of these former regime forces will begin to prey on their fellow citizens as they have few other skills. One options at that point is to recruit a new left wing \u201cspecial body of armed men,\u201d  As discussed with respect to the post-1922 Soviet Union, experience suggests that creating ostensibly leftist professional security forces with a monopoly on weapons has extraordinarily bad outcomes. While it may be tempting for leftists to fantasize about eliminating all white supremacists from the United States, this seems like bad praxis. The only way to do that is to create an enormously powerful security apparatus that will become its own justification, as has tragically been the case so many times in the 20th Century. \n\nAs an alternative to re-enacting the failures of the 20th Century, there is a role for individual gun ownership and non-professional militia formations in a post-revolutionary order. We can think of such a new socialist regime as detente between the forces of the right and the forces of the left. Yes, this will mean that there may be a higher level of localized social disorder. Yes it means some white supremacists will still have access to weapons.  On the other hand, it provides an insurance policy against the very bad outcomes of 20th Century revolutions. \n\nThere is nothing on the capitalist menu that is capable of resolving the contradictions highlighted by school shootings. Instead, we must look towards socialist revolution as the only means of addressing the material circumstances of oppression and despair that creates school shooters in the first place. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","subreddit":"SocialistRA","title":"Leftist Defense of Gun Ownership""num_comments":1,"score":7,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Leftist Defense of Gun Ownership"}

I figured I would put together a thing about some of the tactics we have used and some tips as to not get fucked by the state. A lot of this is common sense but I think everyone should know about it if you are about to go be part of a bloc. \n\n\nMask up with books!\n\nAnti-mask laws suck. They make it so that we can be targeted at protests for trying to hide our identities from \nthe police and fashy types. Normally the laws are if there is a group of 3+ people masked up then the police\nare allowed to grab you. One of the ways to get around this is to bring your favorite book with you!\nWhen the cops start shouting about taking off the masks just pull out your book and stick your nose in it. You \nare now covering your face making it harder to identify, and if you get snatched you can just say \"I was reading why did\nyou arrest me?\" We have used this tactic to get comrades charges dropped after the fact. It works. \n\n\nAvoid the kettle at all costs!\n\nA kettel is a police tactic where the police block a group of protesters from all sides. Usually precludes some kind\nof mass arrest. This was heavily used by police at J20 in DC. The found a cross street and drew the protesters into it\nthen blocked off their escape from either end of the street. They kept everyone blocked in for about 6 hours before they\nswooped in and mass arrested eveyone. Be aware of the kettle and make a point to shout out to the rest of your crew\nif you think the police are pushing you towards a kettle. \n\n\nAlways have someone ready to pull you back.\n\nWhen on the front line and facing down police, always have at least two buddies standing behind you ready to grab\nonto your belt and rip you back into the crowd if the police try to grab you. \n\n\nMilk works better for tear gas than water!\n\nIts fats neutralizes the gas chemically the same way milk stops spicy food. Get a half gallon and throw that shit in\nyour backpack if you think the cops are gonna get edgy with the warcrimes. \n\nEDIT: I meant pepper spray/gas. Sorry for any confusion. \n\nBike blocks are an amazing distraction\n\nI have only seen this done once at a BLM rally. But it was amazing. The cops were trying to kettle us in and out of \nnowhere about 150 kids on bikes came screaming up the street drawing the cops attention away for a few seconds. This\nwas all we needed to scatter and regroup in a park that had enough exits where we could no longer get kettled. If you can organize this before hand, a bike bloc can be an excellent \"cavalry\" to get the \"infantry\" out in a pinch. \n\n\nChange after the rally!\n\nEither wear normal clothes under your bloc attire. Or bring a change with you. I hear that at the g20 summit protests they\nwould encircle the center of their block with a banner and then people could change behind it in the middle of the street\nand then just slink into the rest of the croud so they are less consipuous when leaving. Be careful. I have seen people\nget IDed by their shoes at J20. So bring an extra pair!\n\n\nEncrypt your phone. Turn that shit off when you arent using it. Pull the battery if you can. \n\nIts really black mirror esq and I may just be paranoid but consider any phone (especally ones with FB installed on it)\ncompermised and a potential listening point for law enforcement. I cant prove they use this but better safe than sorry right?\n\n\nWatch out for people with cameras.\n\nThey will be friendly enough, they may even say the support you. 70% of the time they are LEA or fashy types trying\nto identify you. If they genuinly seem like they are on your side and want to talk. Ask that they turn off their camera. \nYou WILL end up in a database or on some dudes youtube channel. \n\n\nBreaking zip ties. \nYou can either use a pin and stick in in the little claw thing that catches on the inside of the locking mechanism. \nPoke it up and it will release. Keep a safty pin in your back pocket. If you are lucky and your hands are in front of you,\npull your knees up to your chest, loop the zipties around your legs, and forcefully pull your hands back. Do this enough\ntimes and the plastic will start to heat up at the center where the ends connect and will snap eventually. \n\nEDIT: im not saying you should try to dearrest yourself. It's risky and a good way to go to jail. I am just reporting what I have seem people do in my city. \n\nSubways are your friends. \nSo shit is going down, you need to get out of there. Dont run down the street in your bloc clothes. You will get snagged. \nRun to the nearest subway. Go to your normal clothes under your bloc clothes. Get on the first train going anywhere. \n\n\nGet the number for the national lawyers guild in your state!\n\nOr some other organization that supports protest movements with legal aid. Bring a sharpie with you. Write the number for the NLG on your arm, you wont remember the number if you get taken in. Pass that marker around and get as many people to do the same as you can. \n\nYou are getting arrested oh shit! Now what?\n\nFor the love of god don't fight. Don't resist. Don't do anything that will catch you extra charges. I know we hate cops and dont respect their authority but this is the difference between a few hours in a holding cell and real time. Look for the comrades close to where you are being arrested. Shout your first name, last name, and date of birth. They will be able to find out what station you are being taken to and can come do jail support. \n\nJail support?\n\nYeah being locked up even for a few hours can be super anxious and emotional. Especially when you are in there alone. Find out where your comrades are being taken. Go sit out side the police station. Tell the cops who come out that you are waiting for your friend and you aren't leaving until they get out. This will usually expedite the process as they don't want a bunch of people causing a scene outside their door. Bring pizza and cigarettes for when they are out. It helps a lot and is a great way to show solidarity. \n\n\nI may add to this as I think of some more. Again most of you probably know this already. But I figured that it may be useful to someone who is new to this :)","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Some street tactics/tips I have picked up over the years."}

{"author":"timmycatchores","created_utc":1520270245,"num_comments":4,"score":0,"selftext":"\nEmotions form the universal language of humanity. How I know anyone is how they use their emotions. \n\nTo know you I would ask firstly what you believe is the function of compassion to humanity. I make a big list of those functions, as part of social justice argumentation, so ones response to that question gives me a clue to their ethics. \n\nI would also ask what are the top 3-5 fears in life. I would ask if they believe altruism is foolish, or part of maintaining dignity.\n\nThose questions on the function of emotions give me a measure of insight into a person psychology with regard to how they view society, and themselves in it.  \n\n--  \n\nI look across the many subcultures of US left activism. My urge to be active is limited by the ideologies and actions created by others.\n\nI use a universal argumentation lens that deconstructs meaning in a general sense. The gist is you can deconstruct motivations, which is equivalent to emotional content, in contrast to the logical content of the idea, which is the rationalization. \n\nI need to look at all subcultures through one critical thinking for  argumentation filter. \n\nThat filter could be considered neutral. It gives me a sense of the truth value and motivation of statement, but what I do with thet information is dependent on my own motivation.   \n\n--\n\nThe neutral critical thinking filter needs to be tied to ones ethics. \n\nCompassion is the root emotion of psychological needs. It is the \"Social Emotion\".\n\nI keep a list of what compassion does since it functions as a logical component for my social justice argumentation. \n\nUnderstanding psychological needs also functions in contexts of child-development, mental-health, and cultural change. \n\nAll social and cultural psychology functions within social justice argumentation, since those disciples provide evidence and justifications. \n\n--\n\nI can't defend humanity from itself within a single US 'left' ideology. I wind-up defending universal ethics against all of them. \n\nUS 'modernist' activist subcultures are not sophisticated enough for a 21st century version of Intersectionality, on the level of universal ethics. \n\nModernists don't understand universal ethics, is the conclusion. \n\n--\n\nThat makes my praxis a different sort of postmodern animal.\n\nUniversal Ethics+Human Ethology+Social-Constructivism+Intersubjectivity+Intersectionality+Argumentation Theory+Child Development \n\nI see Anarchism, Socialism and Communism as historic philosophy. An analysis of those ideologies exposes a big difference between 19th century words and 21st century deeds. Today online we see rhetorical political philosophy as a way of maintaining youth group cohesion.\n\n--\n\nThere's a radical emotional repertoire that I need to hold down, even if it is a lost art and seems weird to see spirituality through a postmodern materialist lens. \n\nThe postmodern lens is just about seeing all the information that constructs social order, including the beliefs of the masses. \n\nThe more I follow that, the easier it is to see it through the critical thinking aspect that deconstructs the emotion and logic of words and behavior. \n\nThe 'arena of meaning' that emotions provide doesn't ever change while logic gets convoluted, contrived and mangled. \n\nThe art is in sorting out the most rational synchrony of emotions and logic, in order to produce the most merciful and positive outcomes.  \n\n--\n\nI look for the Indignation that is a consequence of compassion. I find that in Anarchists, but not all Anarchists. \n\nThe Black Bloc is to me a symbol the right sort of anger. That is an anchor to universal ethics, since compassion is at the root. \n\nI look for the Altruism of Anarchists, because I know the new world will be built with Altruism and not money. \n\nUniversal ethics is simple. I see all people as innocent at birth before they are corrupted by the ideologies of ignorant and corrupt men. I defend humanity from itself. I defend and attempt to promote the metaphysical qualities of compassion, indignation, dignity, humility, mercy, empathy and so on. \n\n--\n\nPrimitivist meets Postmodernist.

By chance, I grab the collection by my hated key. I loathe that evil piece of metal as much it seems to loathe me. Our hatred of each other emerged from our mutual desire to chain the other down and crush their dreams. It has been tied to my key chain for a few years now with no hope of escape just like I have been since I first met the wicked thing. This Key to Hell is my office key.\n\nI cycle through the others until I find the desired one. I loved this key. This key's appearance doesn't match its job. It doesn't shine nor is it gold. Despite all that, for me, it is the Key to Heaven. \n\nAs I let myself into my apartment, a sigh of exhaustion and relief escapes me. I slip off my yellow and black Nike sneakers. I am free now; this part of my life belongs to me. I partake in the best recreation available when I control my time. Very little of my life is mine, so I take care with how I spend it. It's what any sensible individual would do. That is why I immediately turn on my beloved Sony 75\" Ultra High Definition Smart Television. \n\nThe TV is simply the best thing I own. After hours of being bored at work, I can come home and watch the mystical screen. It dazzles and amazes my tired body. When I'm done earning my cash for the day, it's always helpful to have the TV. Its people know what I should spend it on. They always come to help me during my favorite shows.\n\nI sit there comfortably in my electric leather recliner with two cup holders and let my mind go. I can ease myself knowing no one is out to get me here. The boss wants me to work endlessly so he gets more money from my hard work, but here I can feel safe. The TV tells me about another thing that I can feel safe about: an investment in gold.\n\nI may sell off my rare buffalo coins for some money to invest. There's no time to think about that right now though; there's this other guy on the screen now. He does not seem good. Hmm. The TV says, \"Josh Dirkingsons: Bad for Idaho.\" I was right! I knew he was up to something. The TV helps me with everything: what to drive, what to eat, and even who to vote for!\n\nI doze off for a few hours and wake up around 9:00. I'm feeling hungry, so I go to the kitchen. I grab a couple boxes of TV Dinner Meals and throw them into my new chrome microwave with colored display and 20 different settings. While that cooks, I'll make a smoothie with my black Speed Action Optimized Blender. \n\nWith my exquisite meal, I return to the living room. Well, I guess it's also a bedroom. If no one else lives here, does it matter? I don't think it does. You must think I'm lonely. Well, I'm not. I was never good with others, but I don't need them anyway. I have other things. Trust me.

But having had our space attacked twice in the last couple of days, we feel like it's important to share a few reflections and be clear about where we stand. \n\nFirst, no, the actions on Locke and Aberdeen on Saturday night were not organized by the Tower, but yes, we support what happened and are in solidarity with those who carried them out. Class war is happening every day in this city, with constant attacks on poor and working people. It\u2019s disappointing that so many only care about the occasional moment when a bit of anger flows back the other way. The ongoing effects of gentrification in this city are heartbreaking -- waves of displacement, growing violence, and intensifying poverty. You cannot expect for all of this to just be swept under the proverbial rug. We have zero tears to shed for Locke st.\n\nWe feel that a single family being evicted is far worse than everything that happened on Locke St, even if you believe that running luxury businesses is a neutral act. And the level of outrage is particularly despicable considering that there have been two random stabbings of women in the last few days as well. It's beyond disgusting to see conversations about artisan donuts being prioritized over conversations about violence against women. \n\nThis isn't just whataboutism, this is us picking sides. When shit goes down, we aren't on the side of the rich and business class. We're in solidarity with everyone who resists the dominant powers in this city and we make any tactical criticisms we have privately. We oppose all repression and all collaboration with the police. \n\nWe've received several specific threats from far-right groups in the last few days foreshadowmg the attacks on our space. Unsurprismgly, the local business class and the white supremacists who organized anti-immigrant demos In the city last year have found themselves on the same side.  \n\nAll the dramatics from Locke st show that they expected not only to make money pursuing their self-interest and ignoring its impacts on others, they expected to also be loved for it. We aren't \"shocked and horrified\" by being attacked because we never expected the powerful and their bootlickers in this city to thank us for opposing them.  \n\nWe know it's not boutiques that are the main driver of gentrification and the suffering it brings. It's real estate investment, speculation, and the municipal policies that encourage them. Small businesses are often visible and vocal in cheerleading, but aren\u2019t the ones redeveloping whole blocks or carrying out mass evictions. What they have done, though, is to put themselves on the side of the speculators and landlords, poisoning themselves to profit off forces that harm most of their neighbours. We've chosen to critique and oppose them in the past because of their alliance with the rich and the big capitalists, and though they're not most responsible, their actions do have real consequences. \n\nTo be clear, we won\u2018t be filing police reports over this, but rather dealing with it autonomously and drawing on networks of mutual aid. The Tower will continue hosting the kinds of events and groups it always has, putting resources in common and sharing ideas. The events of the past few days change nothing about our project or our politics and we call on everyone with whom we've shared moments of struggle in the past to take some deep breaths and realize that although things are more intense right now, nothing has really changed. \n\nhttps://facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=2097561440270939&amp;id=874240552603040","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Statement from The Tower, Hamilton anarchist space: \"We have zero tears to shed for Locke st.\""}

A public figure from the main opposition chp (which still supports afrin as everyone in turkey is unified in killing kurds) said the FSA were terrorists, which I dont agree, was personally adressed by erdogan and threatened.  \n\nI recently brought this up in a family gathering, they religiously support erdogan. I told them what I felt since its a closed group. I said the soldiers who dies are not martyrs, I asked them what difference there is between them and american soldiers, they both invade foreign lands. They shut me down altogether. It was bad, no one could give any answers as what they did could not be justified in any way.\n\nIt gets stupid, they claim that they\u2019re fighting america by doing this. The people here legit vote for this, the turkic racists are the worst, they used to oppose erdogan, now with this, erdogans %\u2019s will jump to 60s from 45s. This is unbearable. \n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Turkey isn\u2019t doing well."}

If we work together, we'll have it done in no time.*\n\n**Was ist los?**\n\nGenossen! Die Eroberung des Brotes von Peter Kropotkin ist eines der wichtigsten anarcho-kommunistischen Texte. Trotzdem kann man ihn scheinbar nirgendwo im Internet gratis und in nutzbarer Form auf Deutsch finden. (Jedenfalls habe ich ihn nach einer gr\u00fcndlichen Suche nicht gefunden.) Er steht zwar als Scan bei Wikimedia Commons, aber ein Scan ist nicht besonders n\u00fctzlich.

Wir sollten das \u00e4ndern.\n\n**Wie kann ich helfen?**\n\nDas Buch hat 175 Seiten. F\u00fcnfzehn davon sind schon transkribiert. Es bleiben also noch 160.

Wichtig: w\u00e4hle nicht eine der R\u00f6mischen Zahlen! Das ist die Vorrede von Rudolf Rocker.

Arms chained above her head.\n\nThe metal door to this dormitory slams open. Two shades flow in. They unlock her shackles and her arms drop to the ground, waking her up.\n\n\"food please\" With a weak voice she pleads.\n\nThe apparitions don't notice. They leave and the door remains open.\n\nStruggling to stand, she eventually heads for the door.\n\nA new pair of figures enter the room. Different this time.

Scared and bruised, she stands slowly, unsure of what punishment this could summon. Then she walks out.\n\nNow in a new room with no memory of the trip between there and here. But she always finds her way to this featureless, massive room with rocks scattered over the floor. The walls rise for a mile, no reason other than to prove their presence.\n\nThere is an endless din. Hundreds of people bang rocks together. It serves no purpose or utility, but it pleases their master.\n\nMaybe there will be food today.\n\nFear beckons her to work. Rock meets rock. One. Two. Three...

Hundreds of brains, hundreds of deaths multiplied by hundreds of hours.\n\nThere is nothing more in her muscles.\n\nRocks quits banging together; she is unable to lift her arms.\n\nAnother man grabs her arm and pulls her up.

That will motivate her.\" The men found agreement and leave, proud of their solution.\n\nIt was dark now and she crawls back to her gray walls. The chains she wore this morning once again clasp to her wrists as mandated. Trying to ignore her bruises and scrapes and hunger, she sleeps. Maybe tomorrow there will be food.\n\nBut the next day Red didn't wake up.\n\nAnd neither did she the days after.\n\nAnd the din from the rocks continued undisturbed. Not one noticed Red's absence. None of them even recognized their own absence from this world. And so they banged rocks. For their faceless master.

Much of the recent discussion is centered on Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz\u2019s book, *Loaded*, which details the history of slave patrols, white supremacy and American gun culture \u2014 Jeremy Scahill interviewed her on *The Intercept\u2019s* podcast, and now the argument is making its way across social media. This argument is foolish, because it deprives the Left of  power. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDunbar-Ortiz\u2019s argument is problematic because of her omissions, more than anything else.  While she admirably documents the history  of white supremacist self-organized militias, she ignores the historical legal regime of weapons rights that existed in English law before the formation of the United States. Her argument seems to be that the 2nd Amendment was used by white nationalists, therefore, it is invalid. A big part of her argument is also her own personal story of badly executed group security-culture practices within the 1970s radical milieu. This effectively becomes a rejection of power, which is something that leftists cannot afford, now or ever. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe history of firearms rights does not begin on the shores of the American colonies. I skimmed Dunbar-Ortiz\u2019s book in addition to listening to Scahill\u2019s interview. I heard and read no significant mention of the British origins of weapons rights, dating back to the English militia system of the 12th century, and of laws that ordered all freemen to own and train with longbows, the military weapon of the era. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMoreover, English law and custom respected weapons rights outside of the militia as well, in the realm of weapons for self defense. William Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries in fact recognized the individual right to \u201chave arms for \u2026 defense\u201d and that there existed a \u201cnatural right of resistance and self preservation.\u201d Blackstone published the 1st edition of his work in 1765, just before the American Revolution. For more details here are a couple of law review articles from the [University of Virginia](http://www.guncite.com/journals/hardhist.htmland) and [Harvard](http://www.guncite.com/journals/hardcit.html#pg564), respectively. There was a long history of concerns in England over the existence of a standing army, and a belief that standing armies were injurious to liberty. The events of the last few decades shows those fears were justified. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne could argue that the history doesn\u2019t matter, that the history of individual gun ownership in the United States is so tied to white supremacy that it should be eliminated just on those grounds alone. The problem with that argument is that we can make the exact same argument for democracy. Some might argue that representative government is hopelessly bourgeois, and thus should be eliminated. Yet, it was not just elected representatives that voted on Native American genocide. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter all, was it not the directly democratic polities of New England that voted to exterminate Native Americans, using the practice of town meetings and face to face democracy? Democratic practice alone is not enough to stop people from making evil decisions.  This should be a sobering thought for socialists in 2018. We know that the dominant trend today (sorry Stalinists) is democratic socialism of some kind, from representative democracy out to the more horizontalist/libertarian socialist spectrum. But as socialists we have to reckon with the fact that groups can make bad decisions.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you\u2019ve participated in anarchist circles long enough, you\u2019ve seen it too. Someone falls afoul of the group consensus, there\u2019s a flurry of social media posts, a demand to \u201ctake sides,\u201d and then someone gets a notice posted on their front door that they\u2019ve been banned from the local too-cool-for-you social center. And that is from people who in general have excellent politics and are committed to human liberation. The hard to face truth of all of this is that democratic practice and procedure can make bad outcomes. Individual firearms ownership is the last line of defense against democratic politics gone wrong. Yet there is a tension here with gun ownership, one that Dunbar-Ortiz covers in her book. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nShe describes her time in a leftist collective during the 1970s, when they faced threats from the usual right wing assholes. Her group armed themselves, and became obsessed with obtaining all kinds of firearms to address not only the threats they faced, but all kinds of other niches as well. She describes it as being under a kind of spell of weapons.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYet, this does not invalidate weapons themselves \u2014 what it invalidates are the poor tactical choices her organization made. In reality, any organization that arms itself must standardize and budget time and training according to their overall mission. Usually that means standardizing on a few models/cartridges and getting on with training that reflects likely threats. Firearms are tools, and in my experience it\u2019s best not to collect them. Having said that, disarming ourselves and our political movement is a surrender of power that the left cannot afford. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDunbar-Ortiz\u2019s bad choices in her youth do not invalidate power as a whole \u2014 yet that is what she and others are implying. For those who are unarmed and unorganized are not the ones who make history \u2014 they are the ones on whom history is made by others. We can decry the great crimes of European colonialists even as we understand that they were only successful because the colonized lacked the weapons and organization to stop them. Knowing that history, why would one want to reject power? Yes, to discarding white supremacy, and yes to absorbing what is useful from their institutions, including the 2nd Amendment. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere is the danger of power, certainly, of becoming caught up in the way that a young Dunbar-Ortiz did, in planning and obsessing over imagined threats. This is a known problem in martial arts training, as best exemplified in the debates between \u201cstreetfighting\u201d and \u201csport\u201d systems. It has been observed by many that those who focus on \u201cstreetfighting\u201d often end up in a mentally unhealthy place. In addition, systems that focus on \u201cstreetfighting\u201d often lack a freestyle component and thus the practitioners have no way to avoid self delusion and measure their skills. Firearms are just another martial art.  For people who have an interest in firearms for self protection, it makes sense to engage in some kind of competitive training; Smallbore rifle,  Bullseye, IPSC, IDPA, 3-gun, trap, skeet, High Power Rifle, whatever. While these are sports, they all compel shooters to perform under pressure. There is no real way to test \u201clife and death\u201d combat without someone dying during the test, so if we want to prepare for such things we have to make do with events that push performance under stress.  It\u2019s no mistake that the shooting methods of elite military units of the US military have a lot of cross pollination with competitive shooting. For leftists in the US, shooting sports are a healthy way to build practical skills that still have carry over value to self protection. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is usually the part where the snarky will start talking about the awesome power of the United States military and belittle anyone who believes that firearms have a place on the left. However, they forget that in the course of the last hundred years, more than a few governments have fallen or partially retreated. It is hard to know when something like that will happen in the United States, but we would be foolish to believe that it can never happen. After all, the Soviet Union, which crossed 11 time zones and had nuclear weapons, fell apart over the course of a few years. They were a big deal, until they weren\u2019t. Just this weekend, the latest news out of the Trump White House is that turnover in advisors is the most rapid in modern times. In other words, the US faces increasing instability at the top. Only fools would believe that the US could not see the same fate as the Soviet Union in the late 1980s. There is a more recent example of a partial governmental collapse that is more relevant \u2014 Syria. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe experience of the Syrian anarchist councils should be  a cautionary tale for those who believe that power is something that can just be stepped over, or ignored. In 2012, Syrians were marching in the street against the Assad government. Omar Aziz, a Syrian anarchist living overseas, wrote a text called [The Formation of Local Councils](http://www.europe-solidaire.org/spip.php?article40783), which gave instructions on how people organizing in Syria could build parallel governmental institutions and struggle against the state. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe text went into circulation, and Aziz returned to Syria, working with organizers on the ground to implement his ideas about local anarchist councils. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; massive combative demonstrations had created spaces and times outside the control of the state. These demonstrations were often pushed forward by small affinity-based groups of revolutionaries called coordinating committees that operated clandestinely to avoid repression. In the space created, many forms of autonomous self-organizing began to emerge as the state withdrew or was driven back. The Local Council would serve to deepen and expand these practices of self-organization as well as share more broadly the organizing skills and experience of coordinating committees and other groups.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe Syrian government killed Aziz in 2013. Nonetheless, his ideas about local councils spread. While the local councils organized along lines he suggested proliferated, \u201cmany of his comrades in developing the local councils were killed by reactionary conservative armed groups, notably the Douma 4 \u2014 Razan Zeitouneh, Wael Hamada, Samira Khalil, and Nazem Hammadi. They were kidnapped in a liberated area near Damascus by Jaish al-Islam, where they had tried to ensure that the local councils remained in control of the revolution and could act as a check on the armed groups.\u201d Aziz had thought he could work with the Free Syrian Army, but in the end, that did not work out, as the FSA became a haven for Islamist groups. Local councils lacked the ability to protect themselves, and that meant right wing forces became ascendent. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn a nutshell, this is the problem of morality without power \u2014 those with the power will just kill the ones without it. If socialists expect to be able to survive in the collapse of the state, then we must be armed and organized or we will certainly fall to those who are, just as the Syrian local councils fell.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPower is dangerous, no doubt. But morality without power is meaningless. It is what Friedrich Nietzsche called \u201cslave morality.\u201d That is, it is the morality of those without power, who believe that their lack of power is what makes them good, and that those who have and wield power are definitionally bad. Nietzsche contrasts this with \u201cmaster morality\u201d which values courage, the creation of values, and living those values. Now that I\u2019ve invoked Nietzsche, I am sure there are some among those reading who will be quick to condemn me as a crypto-fascist. Let us pause for a moment so that they might make haste towards social media and bring on the social exclusion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBecause that is all that they have. They have no power other than to socially exclude others. And what is that power of exclusion, precisely, in today\u2019s America? The power of social exclusion, so visible now on Facebook as even some on the radical left rush to cut their ARs in half, is really the power to cut people off from the friendship networks that we all need to navigate the brutal reality of neoliberal capitalism, where the strength of our personal brand (as seen on social media) can determine our ability to hold a job and earn money.  Given that for most, gainful employment is necessary to obtain money and buy  a place to live and food to eat, social exclusion is really another way of threatening people with increased exposure to state violence. Thus, we see that the left that allegedly eschews the power of firearms actually does no such thing. In fact, they depend on the power of the state violence \u2014 the special bodies of armed men \u2014 to intimidate and sanction others.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nNo less an anarchist figure than Emma Goldman embraced Nietzsche. In her autobiography she writes that when her friends began to discuss Nietzsche \u201c I took part, expressing my enthusiasm over the great poet-philosopher and dwelling on the impression of his works on me.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGoldman wrote in [The Failure of Christianity](http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/goldman/failureofchristianity.html)  that Nietzsche\u2019s \u201c\u2026master idea had nothing to do with the vulgarity of station, caste, or wealth. Rather did it mean the masterful in human possibilities, the masterful in man that would help him to overcome old traditions and worn-out values, so that he may learn to be the creator of new and beautiful things.\u201d \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nAs socialists, we are fighting and organizing to create a new and beautiful world. We will have to protect that world from all the people who would seek to destroy it, or strangle it as it is being born. And to do that, we have to reject the arguments from our comrades who are remain in thrall to slave morality, like Dunbar-Ortiz and Scahill. \n\n\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"On Guns, Courage, and the Left"}

I\u2019m reminded of that scene in \u201cMy Dinner with Andre\u201d where Andre talks about unconsciously not wanting to admit the humanity of certain other people lest we come to discover that they\u2019re really not all that different from us, which leads to cognitive dissonance.\n\nI recently took a flight from the city where I have been attending a very well-regarded university whose student body is comprised of those from the middle and upper echelons of society.

When I got to the airport to pick up my car from the garage, behind the counter was a young woman who looked exactly like the students at the university.

I recommend you watch it. It gave me the idea to write this piece sorry if i ramble on too much, I just need to let it out.\n\nBefore I was a socialist I was mostly not interested in politics, I had social democrat views and hated the rich and big business. My family has mostly leftist view but we usually don't talk about politics. I was carefree and mostly focused on school work and having fun. Then when I discovered Marxism and anarchism, I didn't became depressed or more sad just a little bit less happy. Knowing about the horrors humans go through in the current global system and the need for change isn't exactly positive to think about. Life isn't all about having pleasure I understand that but being a leftist has made me too aware of the issues. Humans didn't evolve to take in all the information we have access today on the Internet and remain sane.  \n\nI only see a downside in being a leftist, there is no happiness in politics, its pure misery. There is no humanity in politics, there is just power relations and inhumanity. So lately I have made efforts to not focus on politics as much but to focus on enjoying art, philosophy and poetry. This video inspired [me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTXj6ZEANFg) Its the only way to stay sane in this crazy world. I would also like to know what you people do to keep sane. This thread also address the [issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChapoTrapHouse/comments/83rrxp/thanks_rcth/?st=jeo6plnw&amp;sh=c97fffb4)\n\nSo basically I wished I never knew about socialism and just enjoyed myself. I have no power to change anythings what is the point in knowing thousands of pages of theory if I can't be used to change the world, its worthless. Maybe because I am some what privileged to have a middle class life and a decent upbringing but still most people I know never worry about politics. I have a limited time on this planet and yet I waste time thinking about politics, what a cruel joke.   \n\nEDIT: Since I posted this late(I live in Australia, time zone difference) I will respond as soon I get the time after I wake up. So you might have to wait a while for a response, sorry...","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Its soul crushing to be a leftist"}

One of their platform points in particular stood out to me:\n\n&gt;Because we believe in building community solutions to the issues we face, outside of the state.\n\nOne of my largest critiques of anarchism has been that most people will not willingly give up the security and comfort they've come to expect from the institutions of the state.  As such, one of the things I've been committed to exploring is how we could replace institutions provided by the state with things that operate outside their strictures and structures as much as is presently practicable.\n\nPortland Anarchist Road Care is one solution - someone needs to fix the roads - but what else?  Can we generate power?  What about manufacturing?  Or the internet?  Or other infrastructure?  Beyond that what about education?\n\nI've been thinking about a cooperative higher education model that's accredited but *free.*  So - I hate the idea of accreditation - where there's power endowed in some body that dolls out certificates to schools for being \"legit\" or not, but I understand that right now one of the largest barriers to success that people face is job training and education.  If we could figure out a way to freely educate people where they're not enslaved with debt, but still have the requisite piece of paper they need to interface with modern society then that would be a net victory.  How would someone go about creating this?  \n\nA self-sustaining system, where people come in, get educated for free, then can go out and join the working world would show people that anarchism can work.  It'd sow the ranks of the working world with a bunch of young people who are unencumbered by student loan debt who also have taken classes in union organizing and direct action.\n\nImagine if we could start spitting out engineers, and scientists, and philosophers, and artists who don't have any debt?  What about doctors and nurses?  They don't NEED to join the economy like I had to, or like many other people had to.  They can start squats or communes if they want.  They could organize in their workplace and not be afraid of getting fired.  The possibilities feel endless.  Are they?","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Replacing Institutions Idea"}

But I feel like in the last couple of years, the anarchist fiends I've had have drifted so far into the corporate social media and corporate cultural universe that it feels like I'm going crazy. \nThe anarchist culture I was part of in the 1990s was built around infoshops and anarchist bookstores and all-ages shows where folks did book distros and distributed zines, music, propaganda and other anarchist info. As the Internet grew, we still had independent forums to communicate, like Infoshop.org and Indymedia and a whole list of open source, non corporate forums. But that world is gone, replaced by Facebook, Twitter and yes, even Reddit. \nI feel like I'm now living in some corporate dystopia, only this dystopia is so normalized that no one notices. If I'd suggested to anarchist friends back in 1997 that in 20 years we would abandon Indymedia and independent forums for giant corporate social media entities that would manipulated newsfeeds and spy on our messages and sell every word to advertisers and government agencies, they would would have laughed in my face. But now, twenty years later that is exactly where we are.\nI hate that I keep an account on Facebook. I hate what it is and that almost all my old friends are on there. Our participation in this corporate media entity changes us. It changes how we view capitalism. I can see my friends censoring the things they talk about. They worry, as I do, about who is listening and whether things they talk about or newsfeeds they post will upset more apolitical and conservative friends and family. \nI've quit Facebook a few times. But I get lonely and in a world where everyone moves away, it's the place where I reconnect with all my friends. It's an entity that is incredibly manipulative. And profitable.\nI quit again a week ago, but I'm weak and I will probably be back. I started arguing with people. You aren't supposed to do that on Facebook. You are supposed to mindlessly read stupid newsfeeds, roll your eyes and ignore or click the like button. \nThis time an old anarchist friend posted a link to the new Black Panther movie gushing about how great it was for African-Americans. I admit, I haven't seen the film. I do know it's made by The Disney Corporation. I know Disney was founded by Uncle Walt, who was anti-Union, anti-Semitic and faithfully attended Naxi meetings in 1939s Hollywoid. As I said, I haven't seen the film, but I do know the basic plot points (Spoiler Alert!). A black super hero, who is the wealthy king of an isolationist, futuristic African nation that made a deal with white colonizers to ignore all the bad shit white nations did (ie, slavery, colonization, apartheid etc) in return for being left alone, fights a black militant villian named Killmonger (get it?) who comes from Oakland (birthplace of the real Black Panthers), is portrayed as a violent thug and who wants to arm black people to fight white supremacy. The villian gets a spear in the chest from the black super hero and the black super hero saviour is helped by a heroic white CIA agent, because, of course, the CIA has a long history of helping black folks, especially in Africa. \nI point all this out to my friend who proceeds to educate me on how, as a white man, I am ignorant and I have no right to criticize this film or Walt Disney and how we don't live in the radical 1960s (or less radical 1990s) anymore and I gotta get with the new program and understand that this Disney movie and all it represents is as good as it's gonna get for black folks. I remind her she is also white, that some black folks have criticized this film and that it is sad, not a cause for celebration, that a Disney film is seen as radical, by anyone.\nShe got a few dozen likes for her comment. I got none.\nThis isn't the first time shit like this has happened. Every election in the last 10 years I get anarchists (former anarchists?) on Facebook telling me to vote for some left of centre candidate and party. Telling me that if I don't vote, I can't complain. I usually answer with that famous quote from Emma Goldman that if voting changed anything the government would make it illegal. They tell me to grow up, that radicalism has failed and that I need to be pragmatic. I ask them why they were anarchists in the first place. They tell me to fuck off. I leave Facebook for a while.\nI don't know. Am I just one of those pathetic old people who long for some faraway romanticized past? Are the 1990s already that \"faraway past\". I guess I just don't fit in this modern world anymore.\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"I feel like I'm going crazy"}

Coastal liberal elites are 100% into the idea of the state as this perfect neutral arbiter of justice. They also never tire of punching left and trying to keep socialists, communists, and anarchists from asserting any political power. As Nancy Pelosi reminded us in 2016, \u201cwe\u2019re capitalists and that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d Coastal liberal elites are all in on gun control, and they relentlessly campaign for the idea that one\u2019s personal safety is the responsibility of the police. They constantly repeat the mantra that widespread concealed carry will make \u201cblood run in the streets.\u201d Yet that has happened [nowhere](https://www.texastribune.org/2015/09/24/study-says-concealed-carry-permits-dont-affect-cri/) in the United States that went to a shall-issue permitting regime.  If we want to undermine the credibility of liberal elites, we must show the public that those same liberal elites are incoherent cowards. As socialists, it\u2019s important for us to undermine the credibility of liberals so that we can advance our own policies in the alternative. National concealed carry reciprocity would effectively void local pistol control laws in places like NYC and Los Angeles. This would make it much easier for leftist organizers to openly discuss armed self-protection, since it would then be legalized almost across the board. The radicalizing effect of this cannot be understated. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs I\u2019ve written [previously](https://medium.com/@similarfreedom/a-leftist-defense-of-gun-ownership-dialectical-materialist-edition-bfa0d9a89d23):\n&gt;Moreover, from a dialectical materialist perspective, taking guns out of popular hands breeds compliance and subservience. How could it not? When people are denied the ability to exercise violence they surrender the protection of their physical integrity to others. Such a material circumstance must necessarily change their subjectivity, as they must now reconcile their basic helplessness by embracing the people who wield violence \u201con their behalf,\u201d in other words, their masters. One have only to look at the wholly servile social democratic parties of Western Europe, and even some still calling themselves Communists, to see the profoundly deradicalizing effect of accepting civilian disarmament as \u201ccivilized.\u201d In the United States, it is no accident that the almost completely disarmed professional class liberals of the Northeast corridor worship authority and the security services. By disarming the populace in the urban Northeast corridor, the American elite have created a material environment that assists them in building, reproducing, and valorizing a subservient subjectivity among the professional class that keeps the elite in power. Disarmed people who believe in the morality of their vulnerability have no power, which is precisely what the ruling class wants.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlthough [42 states](http://www.gun-nuttery.com/maps/2017.gif)  in the US now embrace shall-issue concealed carry permits or permit-less carry,  there are a minority of states that still allow law-enforcement agencies to deny permits to people for any reason. In states like Massachusetts, New York and California the urban areas have very strict policies against granting ordinary people concealed carry permits, but if you move inland, local law enforcement often has a much more permissive attitude towards concealed carry. Indeed, when considering this fact, one realizes that in almost the entirety of the United States, concealed carry is available to almost all adults. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYet despite that, the coastal liberal elites in the metropolitan areas of Boston, Los Angeles, Baltimore, New York, and the San Francisco Bay Area are [utterly terrified](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/concealed-carry-reciprocity-act-showdown/) of  widespread civilian concealed carry coming to their cities. For example, consider this [meltdown](https://youtu.be/RmkRZvw7yFw?t=3h25s) by Congressman Jamie Raskin from Maryland or this [freakout](https://youtu.be/RmkRZvw7yFw?t=5h32m) by Congressman David Cicilline from Rhode Island during a congressional hearing on national reciprocity. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThese people are, frankly, cowards, and we can expose them as such if national reciprocity becomes a reality. We must consider the actual role of liberals in places like New York City and the San Francisco Bay Area. Their role is to smooth over class struggle waged by wealthy real estate developers against all working people. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLiberals are quick to take refuge in identity politics \u2014 they\u2019ll talk to you about how now there are now gay POC business executives and political leaders even as Leilani Farha, UN Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing compares poverty in  San Francisco to [Mumbai](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/22/un-rapporteur-homeless-san-francisco-california).  \n&gt;Farha was struck by the stories she heard of homeless people losing their few possessions in encampment sweeps, and laws that criminalize sitting on sidewalks or food sharing. *\u201cThere\u2019s a cruelty here that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen,\u201d* she said.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt is absolutely outrageous and a crime against humanity for such extreme poverty to exist side by side with the wealth of coastal America. Liberals will never make meaningful changes that undermine the fat paychecks that they get from wealthy real estate developers, and that means that more people will be driven into poverty and life on the streets. They believe that the state is neutral, rather than the state being a contested space that today works on behalf of capitalists against everyone else, against the survival of humanity itself. Institutionally, liberals have used gun control as a litmus test to weed our radicals. After the end of the 60s uprisings, liberal Democrats went all in for gun control. Former student radicals, even folks from SDS and the Weather Underground, were welcomed into the Democratic Party, so long as they swore off guns forever \u2014 for any reason \u2014 and bowed down to state violence as the ultimate arbiter of justice. In doing so, they cut off the radical left, even as the radical right was put under no such constraints. In effect, the Democrats deradicalized the left. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOur only solution to this disgusting, life-threatening state of affairs is mobilization and organizing of working people, and we cannot do that while liberals are co-opting social movements, and socialists, at every chance they get. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBased on the hysterical reaction of liberal leaders to even the proposal of national reciprocity, it seems likely that actual implementation of it would cause even greater panic. People in a state of panic make impulsive and bad decisions, and this may very well damage their ability to co-opt social movements and genuine moments of uprising. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere is another reason to encourage an arms bearing culture on the left, and that is the always present  possibility of [rupture](https://medium.com/@similarfreedom/on-guns-courage-and-the-left-a4b5b8774de2). In such a moment where the state fails, an unarmed and tentative left will be easy prey for rightist forces.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNational concealed carry reciprocity would thus serve three purposes \u2014 genuinely empowering the working class to take their agency into their own hands, undermining the decision making ability of the liberal class elites who do so much to crush socialism, and strengthening the ability of socialist organizations to openly discuss effective self-protection. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs socialists, we should always strive to sharpen the contradictions between us and capitalist forces. National concealed carry reciprocity would do exactly that. \n","subreddit":"SocialistRA","title":"The One Simple Trick That Could Undermine Liberals And Sharpen the Contradictions""num_comments":0,"score":4,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"The One Simple Trick That Could Undermine Liberals And Sharpen the Contradictions"}

A hacking and creation of techno-scientific infrastructure to turn the material and virtual tools of White Supremacist Capitalist Patriarchy against itself, to the end of creating nothing less than an infrastructure of globally hegemonic proportions. \n\n2. Aggressive anti-naturalism with a focus of overturning the biological domination felt by women and queer people. There is nothing that cannot be scientifically interrogated and technologically manipulated, as they say: \"Let 100 sexes bloom!\" and \"If nature is unjust, then change nature!\"\n\n3. A materialist analysis of modern conditions, identifying the existence of class-based society to be the source of woe. XF doesn't stop short of wanting to break down all divisions of and recognition of identity so that \"everyone has the right to speak as no one in particular.\"\n\nWhat Xenofeminism is not: \n\n1. A bid for revolution or insurrection. XF wants to infect the infrastructure of white supremacist capitalist patriarchy and submerge it \"in a sea of procedures\" as to \"soften its shell\" to become transformed into something else entirely. This is a process of slow seeping, not explosive transformations. \n\n2. Anarchist in effect. Laboria Cubonix has expressed frustrated sentiments towards anti-statists and our goals limited to \"isolated localities and fragmentary insurrections.\" XF wants to create a modular open-source hardware and software (material and virtual) to imagine a system of tesselating universalism.  \n\nI haven't read of Laboria Cubonix offering a model that isn't theoretical and abstract but allow me to attempt one myself: \n\nThe *Xenos Vesparum* is a tiny parasitic insect that use wasps as their host species. Females spend their entire life-cycle inside the wasps abdomen, blurring the lines of internal and external boundaries of the wasp.  \n The wasps that have been infected with the parasitic insect begin to change behavior. They begin to lose nutrition and somehow this compells them to be attracted to other infected wasps. The wasps who are infected with female insects begin to fatten, despite nutrion loss from the insect, to look more like a queen wasp. Once the parsitic insect is fully mature the wasp simulating a queen wasp will then mingle with uninfected queens and begin to spread their larvae through the actual queen wasps brood.  \n*Xenos Vesparum* is literally an infection, a virus. It is a parasite, who's females of the species take over and co-opt the life-force and behaviors of its host, with the ultimate goal of transforming the entire brood with subversion, sublimation, and stealing.\n\nThe female *Xenos Vesparum* is the model of Xenofeminism. Transfrorming and sublimating her host, not destroying it. Using her hosts faculties against themselves to proliferate endlessly. I'd like to propose that each larva that infects the brood is a different, modular open-source code than its predecessor but still keeps the primary function of the original parasite. In this way Xenofeminism wants to create a platform for global hegemony but not a program that dictates the precise technicalities. \n\nUltimately I see this as a vision for what Communism should look like for the 21st century. Obviously this vision understandably puts a sour taste in many anarchists mouths, as it does to me. So here are some general thoughts for anti-statists to begin to think about.  \n\n1. Not covered here, XF critiques the left's  outdated illusion of revolutio and the resultint chronic melancholy and defeatism this produces, this is down a very similar vein that post-left anarchists do. \n\n2. Think about body hacking, social hacking, and undermining existing technologies of oppression to create new, liberating forms of technological mediation\n\n3. The biggest failing I see - beyond the obvious blind faith in the technoscientific sphere - is its silence on ecology and how current technological infrastructure only serves to destroy and obliterate the limits of ecology. \n\n4. XF is a politics of pure anthropocene. Taken to its extreme, which Laboria Cubonix certainly do, ecology is to be manipulated and altered using technological mediation, ultimately infecting ecologies that have nothing to do with humans beyond residing on the same planet.\n\n5. This is Leviathanic in *nature* and ignores anti-civilization critiques. Is it possible to hijack a larva of XF for our own ends of degrading and breaking apart the infrastructures of civilization? Does XF allow room for anti-civilization fragmentaries? How can and should these proliferate using the XF model if subverting, sublimation, and stealing?\n\n\ufffc***\n\nSo feel free to post this around. I know this will disappear and all of this will be for naught and that's okay I guess. Laboria Cubonix is publishing a book in a few weeks under the title *Xenofeminism* and this is mostly in preparation for that.

{"author":"PerfectSociety","created_utc":1521306410,"author":"PerfectSociety","created_utc":1521001990.0,"num_comments":9,"score":8,"selftext":"**An Economic Problem**\n\n[Intellectual Property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property) is fundamentally different from other kinds of Property, because it concerns the ownership of that which is not [scarce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarcity). Intangible creations of human intellect (I will refer to these as \"ICHI\" from here onwards) are not scarce, as there is no inherent cost in reproducing them. To the extent that scarcity is involved in the process of reproducing ICHI, it only applies when said creations are reproduced by means of utilizing scarce resources. For example: printing multiple physical copies of a literary text requires the use of paper (a scarce resource). Given that property norms already apply to resources (like paper) that are used to reproduce multiple copies of ICHI, there is no reason why - from the standpoint resource utilization efficiency alone - we should apply property norms to ICHI such that it becomes \"Intellectual Property\" (I will often refer to Intellectual Property as \"IP\" going forward). \n\nThe main argument put forth in favor of Intellectual Property is that of incentivizing the continued creation of ICHI. The argument is that without IP, there will be far less incentive to create ICHI and therefore we will see less of it overall. However, when we look at the research done about incentives and about the economic costs that Intellectual Property involves, it becomes clear that this argument does not hold up. \n\n(A) **On the matter of Incentives:** The [research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc) shows that the strongest motivators for people to engage in economic value-producing activity/work (once their basic needs are relatively secure) are Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose. It is not money. Furthermore, the [evidence thus far](https://economics.mit.edu/files/7823) shows that intellectual property actually discourages innovation substantially and that placing ICHI in the public domain greatly encourages innovation:\n\n&gt; To summarize, although only tentative conclusions can be drawn given the small number of empirical studies, the body of available empirical evidence suggests that\npatents may substantively hinder both subsequent scientific research and subsequent product development. Across a relatively heterogeneous set of technologies within the life sciences, and examining various forms of intellectual property rights, **the available empirical evidence suggests that property rights hinder cumulative innovation\u2014with declines on the order of 30 percent.** Clearly much more work is needed in order to examine the extent to which these patterns generalize to other technologies and other forms of intellectual property, but **the best available evidence suggests that mechanisms that reward innovation in a way that places the technologies in the public domain\u2014such as patent buyouts\u2014may have substantial benefits in terms of encouraging cumulative innovation, at least in some contexts**.\n\n(B) **On the matter of Economic Costs:** Intellectual Property causes prices to be [substantially higher](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/05/intellectual-property-prescription-drugs-trans-pacific-partnership) than they otherwise would be as [Dean Baker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Baker) demonstrates: \n\n&gt; The idea of imposing a 20 percent tariff on imported shoes or steel would send any mainstream economist into a frenzy. They all know how tariffs distort the market, leading to waste and corruption. But when it comes to patents and copyrights, the difference we are talking about \u2014 between the protected price and the \u201cfree market price\u201d \u2014 is ten or even a hundred times higher than it would be otherwise. If that sounds far-fetched, consider the Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi. It carries a list price in the US of $84,000 for a three-month course of treatment. High-quality generic versions are available in India for less than $300. Many of the new cancer drugs carry list prices in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. In almost all cases these drugs are cheap to produce; it is the patent monopoly that makes them expensive.\n\n[Additionally](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/05/intellectual-property-prescription-drugs-trans-pacific-partnership), IP has further created an economic cost burden by legally requiring intermediary service provides (such as websites that host material made by others) to enforce IP and the nuances that it entails within their domain of operation in order to avoid criminal prosecution themselves. Such requirements are codified into not just new laws aimed at bolstering IP but also into trade agreements between nations. The TPP is the most recent and expansive example of this. \n\nMost importantly, when accounting for net economic impacts of IP...Intellectual Property propagates corruption of the State to achieve new rent-seeking privileges and expand on existing ones. This is [especially apparent](http://www.columbia.edu/~gl2291/Job_Market_Paper_GL.pdf) when assessing the overall economic impact of lobbying to extend IP protections into international trade agreements. It shows that IP lobbying produces such enormous rents, that it can turn the entirety of a trade agreement into a net negatives: \n\n&gt; Lobbying has been thoroughly analyzed in the context of trade protection, but there is little literature on lobbying for intellectual property rights (IPR), yet IPR is increasingly becoming the focus of international agreements. I propose a model that analyzes the effect of firm lobbying for IPR protection in an international setting in innovation-driven economies.  In particular, I compare the IPR protection level and global social welfare between the case when countries set their IPR policies non-cooperatively and when they enter an international treaty, such as the TRIPS, TPP and TTIP. I find that **lobbying necessarily leads to inefficient international agreements resulting in too much IPR protection and may even be welfare-reducing relative to no cooperation.** I also show that international lobbying and high concentration of capital can further exacerbate this outcome.  The model generates predictions consistent with patterns I find in the data concerning firms\u2019 lobbying expenditures and the value of their international patent portfolios.\n\n**A Political Problem**\n\nIn addition to the point above about IP lobbying and international trade, [it is not clear](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/05/intellectual-property-prescription-drugs-trans-pacific-partnership) that there is any institutional or structural means of limiting or stopping the phenomenon of expanding rent-seeking privileges. For example, as Dean Baker points out: \n\n&gt; While patent monopolies have promoted corruption, the copyright system has become increasingly dysfunctional in the digital age, even as the United States has pushed to expand the duration and strength of these monopolies. In the 1970s, the term of copyright was an already-steep fifty-five years. It is now ninety-five years. And Congress is likely to extend it yet again, to prevent Disney from losing its copyright on Mickey Mouse (seriously).","subreddit":"debatepoliticalphil","title":"[Argument - Political Economy, Economics]: A Case Against Intellectual Property""num_comments":0,"score":14,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"A Case Against Intellectual Property - Some useful points to raise when debating proponents"}

Therefore, if regular efficiency gains from capitalist production do not results in constant or decreased aggregate consumption of said resources we will exhaust the planet's resources and undergo a collapse of civilization. From here onward I will often refer to this concept as the \"Resource Utilization Efficiency and Consumption Dynamic\", which I will refer to in abbreviated form as \"RUECD\". \n\n(ii) The data shows that, in general, regular efficiency gains from industrial capitalist production have actually been historically followed by [*increases*](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/52fa/9ca246dcad8bd60b1f2efa3941b47c9be186.pdf) in aggregate consumption of said resources: \n\n&gt; **Historically, past efficiency improvements have generally not proven to be successful in reducing mankind\u2019s  overall  consumption  of  resources. Of  the  over  75  decades  examined  across  ten activities,  only  a  handful  of  decades  had  rates  of  efficiency  improvement  that  exceeded  or matched  rates  of  quantity  increase.** In  these  cases,  efficiency  mandates,  price  pressures,  and industry  upheaval contributed  to  these periods of  decreased  or  stabilized  resource  consumption. Based  upon  these  historical  cases, it  does  appear  that  efficiency  mandates  and  price  pressures, when  applied  under  appropriate  circumstances,  may  prove  effective  in  reducing  resource consumption.  However, efficiency improvements without external pressures or mandates, rarely appear to lead to reductions in resource consumption. \n\n(iii) As per (i) and (ii), this is unsustainable. \n\n(iv) Industrial Agriculture has a worse RUECD than does industrial production in general. This is shown by the fact that in the *Nitrogen Fertilizer Production Quantity vs. Efficiency of the Haber-Bosch Process* graph on p. 7 of the above study, our Nitrogen Production Quantity (our consumption of said resource) has had a rate of rise significantly faster than the Efficiency gains in the [Haber-Bosch Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process) (the process we use to create artificial fertilizer for industrial agriculture). This trend is far worse than for most of the other core resources displayed on the other graphs on p. 7-9, which (unlike *Nitrogen Quantity vs. H-B*) show a trend of efficiency gains and resource consumption mostly keeping pace with each other. \n\n(v) To make matters worse Industrial Agriculture is overall [grossly inefficient](https://roarmag.org/magazine/seed-freedom-future-farming/). While [small farmers use 30% of agricultural resources to produce 70% of global food, industrial agriculture uses 70% of agricultural resources to produce 30% of global food](https://books.google.com/books/about/Who_Really_Feeds_the_World.html?id=YL1IDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=twopage&amp;q=30%20percent&amp;f=false). And that does not even account for the differences in negative externalities between the two approaches. [Vandana Shiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandana_Shiva) explains this thoroughly: \n\n&gt; Contrary to the myth that small farmers should be wiped out because they are unproductive and we should leave the future of our food in the hands of the poison cartel, surveillance drones and spyware, **small farmers are providing 70 percent of global food using 30 percent of the resources that go into agriculture. Industrial agriculture is using 70 percent of the resources to create a quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions, while providing only 30 percent of our food. This commodity-based agriculture has caused 75 percent of the destruction of soils, 75 percent of the destruction of water resources, and pollution of our lakes, rivers and oceans.** Finally, as I set out in my book, Who Really Feeds the World? (Zed Books, 2016), 93 percent of crop diversity has been pushed to extinction through industrial agriculture. \n\n(vi) And as one can logically conclude from (iv), this has even worse implications for the sustainability of our civilization that does the RUECD for industrial production in general: \n\n&gt; **At this rate, if the share of industrial agriculture and industrial food in our diet is increased to 45 percent, we will have a dead planet.** There will be no life, no food, on a dead planet. That is why rejuvenating and regenerating the planet through ecological processes has become a survival imperative for the human species and all beings. Central to the transition is a shift from fossil fuels and dead carbon, to living processes based on growing and recycling living carbon.\n\n**A Political Problem**\n\n(vii) It is tempting to embrace the solution proposed by Dahmus and Gutowski without further thought:\n\n&gt; Of  the  over  75  decades  examined  across  ten activities,  only  a  handful  of  decades  had  rates  of  efficiency  improvement  that  exceeded  or matched  rates  of  quantity  increase. In  these  cases,  efficiency  mandates,  price  pressures,  and industry  upheaval contributed  to  these periods of  decreased  or  stabilized  resource  consumption. **Based  upon  these  historical  cases, it  does  appear  that  efficiency  mandates  and  price  pressures, when  applied  under  appropriate  circumstances,  may  prove  effective  in  reducing  resource consumption.** However, efficiency improvements without external pressures or mandates, rarely appear to lead to reductions in resource consumption.\n\n(viii) However, it is not clear that there is sufficient institutional or structural means of imposing such efficiency mandates or price pressures. Because there is [no indication](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2007/01/01/agriculture-of-corruption/) that political institutions are capable of enacting agriculture policy in the interests of sustainability rather than based on what agribusiness interest groups want.

(At least, I cannot find one.) A start has been made on Wikisource, but only one chapter has been transcribed. Transcribing is not a lot of work. If we work together, we'll have it done in no time.*\n\n**Was ist los?**\n\nGenossen! Die Eroberung des Brotes von Peter Kropotkin ist eines der wichtigsten anarcho-kommunistischen Texte. Trotzdem kann man ihn scheinbar nirgendwo im Internet gratis und in nutzbarer Form auf Deutsch finden. (Jedenfalls habe ich ihn nach einer gr\u00fcndlichen Suche nicht gefunden.) Er steht zwar als Scan bei Wikimedia Commons, aber ein Scan ist nicht besonders n\u00fctzlich. Es hat schon mal jemand [auf Wikisource](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Die_Eroberung_des_Brotes) mit einer Transkription angefangen, aber davon ist nur ein Kapitel fertig. Wir sollten das \u00e4ndern.\n\n**Wie kann ich helfen?**\n\nDas Buch hat 175 Seiten. F\u00fcnfzehn davon sind schon transkribiert. Es bleiben also noch 160. Aus pers\u00f6nlicher Erfahrung wei\u00df ich, dass eine Seite transkribieren ~~weniger als f\u00fcnfzehn Minuten~~ nur ein Paar kostet. Das w\u00e4hren also etwa 40 Arbeitsstunden. Das ist viel f\u00fcr ein Individuum, aber verteilt \u00fcber 40 Leute w\u00e4re das ganze im Nu fertig.\n\nFalls du mithelfen m\u00f6chtest, gehe auf [diese Seite](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Index:Die_Eroberung_des_Brotes.pdf). Klicke auf eine der roten Arabischen Zahlen und fange an zu transkribieren.  **Benutze daf\u00fcr den OCR** Mehr Info dazu im n\u00e4chsten Teil. Wichtig: w\u00e4hle nicht eine der R\u00f6mischen Zahlen! Das ist die Vorrede von Rudolf Rocker. Die ist nicht gemeinfrei (Rocker starb 1958, vor weniger als 70 Jahren) und deswegen nicht auf wikisource erlaubt.\n\nFalls du zuf\u00e4llig ein Ebook von dieser genauen \u00dcbersetzung (die von Bernhard Kampffmeyer aus 1919) hast, geht das ganze nat\u00fcrlich noch viel schneller. Einfach copy, paste, wikisyntax (siehe unten).\n\nIch empfehle in einem Kommentar hier zu melden an welchen Seiten du arbeiten wirst, damit wir uns nicht im Wege stehen. Ich werde direkt nachdem ich diesen Post ver\u00f6ffentliche, anfangen die ersten f\u00fcnf Seiten zu transkribieren.\n\nKannst dich nicht entscheiden mit welcher Seite du anfangen m\u00f6chtest? Klicke [hier](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=random+number+between+50+and+142&amp;t=ffsb&amp;ia=answer) um ein W\u00fcrfel entscheiden zu lassen.\n\n**Wie transkribiere ich eine Seite bei Wikisource?**\n\nSobald du auf eine rote Zahl geklickt hast, kommst du auf die Transkriptionsseite und kannst anfangen. **Benutze den OCR. Klicke oben auf der Leiste auf \"OCR\" und dein Rechner macht einen (ziemlich guten) Transkriptionsversuch, den du dann nur noch korrigieren musst.** Du brauchst daf\u00fcr kein Konto. Du wirst gefragt werden, ob du den Visuellen Editor benutzen m\u00f6chtest. Das kannst du machen; ich empfehle es aber nicht. Die wikisyntax ist nicht sonderlich komplizierter als die bei Reddit. Eine \u00dcbersicht findest du [hier](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Wikisource:Seite_bearbeiten). (Die Sterne die manchmal Abs\u00e4tze trennen produziert man mit {{Center|*}}.

Enjoy!\n\n# Four molotov cocktails was thrown at embassy on \u00d8sterbro\n\n**The police has secured technical leads after molotov cocktails against Turkisk embassy**\n\nCopenhagen Police claims that unknown perpetrators threw at least four molotov cocktails against the Turkish Embassy on \u00d8sterbro in Copenhagen.  \nAccording to investigator Torben Madsen, to DR News.\n\n- \"We think, that there were four perpetrators\", he states.\n\nPolice has been busy all night collecting leeds in and around the big, grey patrician-villa.  \nLead investigator tells DR News, that the technicians have secured technical evidence. Among other things pieces of the bottles, that the four cocktails were made from. [translators note: Good fucking job]\n\n**Completely sooted**\n\nThis night, at around 03:00, the cops recieved a report of fire in the building.  \nThe police still doesn't know who is behind the attack, but since the building has several cameras installed, the police hopes to get some help from the CCTV system.  \nIt's very clear that the building has been on fire. Outside, at the first floor of the house, you can see black soot, and how the fire has destroyed parts of the facade, narrates DR News reporters at the scene.  \n- \"It's a big building. One of the windows are open on the first floor, and the rest of the window is completely sooted, as if the cocktail hit there\", narrates journalist Sara Kleist.\n\n**Police saw it happen**\n\nA cop car is parked 20 metres from the house. A female officer is standing at the entrance, taking pictures in the garden for documentation.  \nFor some time, the police have blocked the area in a large radius around the embassy, but the blockade has now been removed. The police demand is no longer significant, according to journalist Sara Kleist.  \nThe police informed earlier this morning that a cop car near the embassy saw the attack happen.  \nThe cops saw multiple individuals running away from the scene, possibly en route to Svanem\u00f8llen train station, but a description of the assumed perpetrators does not exist yet.  \nThe embassy is empty during the night, and thus nobody has been hurt.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"[TRANSLATED] 4 Molotov Cocktails Thrown At Turkish Embassy in Denmark"}

{"author":"whitelighter-","created_utc":1521508544,"num_comments":4,"score":0,"selftext":"I'm here to start a conversation on how to most effectively advance the political ideas we all share. I have seen some common responses repeated many times so I will just say: comments of the type \"found a liberal\" or \"ok you're a Nazi / you support Nazis\" do not contribute anything to the conversation. Let's avoid just making noise and calling names. Please try to destroy my argument instead; I'd love to have a conversation and I'm really hoping it doesn't start with mindless insults hurled at the guy you disagree with.\n\n# The Argument\n\nI've seen here a near-universally held opinion that I've never seen supported by academic or politically active Anarchists. Stated as an argument: \"one ought to attack Nazis in the streets because it fights fascism\".\n\nHere are the unsupported claims implied by this argument:\n\n### \"Fascism is a real political movement in the US\"\n\nWhy should we focus on fascism in 2018? I cannot find a single politically powerful fascist entity in the US. **The largest fascist organization I can find has 500 members**. [1] Why are we devoting so much time to a few hundred or few thousand bigots? A group of 500 has zero political power in a country of over 300,000,000; especially when they're largely working class. Let's focus on attacking the people with power - the rich.\n\n### \"Fascism is one of the biggest problems in the US\"\n\nGiven this miniscule amount of fascists in the US, is targeting Nazis the best route to go in effecting political change? Seems like there may be bigger fish to fry (maybe target the super-rich????? idk)\n\n### \"Punching a Nazi on the street results in fewer Nazis\"\n\nEven assuming that Nazism/fascism is a real problem in the US, why would punching random Nazis\nchange anything? Seems to me that creates a pissed off Nazi who can now see themself as a victim too! I thought the goal was to *reduce* violence...\n\nAnd now, I'll even give the assumption that Nazis who are punched are less vocal and less violent. How does Nazi punching effect the *broader* political situation? You gonna punch each Nazi until they all give in?\nIs this effect large enough, and in the correct direction, to warrant violent action?\nIs this effect larger than the effect of Fox News displaying these actions as examples of \"the violent left\"? Keep in mind they have ~3,500,000 unique viewers every month.\n\nIt just seems like the whole \"punch a Nazi\" thing is a distraction. Instead of fighting against the massive and constantly growing power of the rich, we've shifted our attention to a boogeyman that doesn't even exist! Chomsky couldn't have said it better *\"Antifa is a major gift to the right\"*.\n\nI'll end this post with a [Crass quote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCDUhR8vK70) (I've had people tell me \"listen to Crass lyrics\"\nto defend antifa violence lolol):\n\n&gt; **Pogo on a nazi, spit upon a jew**\n\n&gt; **Vicious mindless violence that offers nothing new**\n\n&gt; **Left wing violence, right wing violence, all seems much the same**\n\n&gt; Bully boys out fighting, it's just the same old game\n\n&gt; Boring fucking politics that'll get us all shot\n\n&gt; Left wing, right wing, you can stuff the lot\n\n&gt; Keep your petty prejudice, I don't see the point\n\n&gt; **ANARCHY AND FREEDOM IS WHAT I WANT**\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditionalist_Worker_Party","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Violence?"}

They should know that monopolization over natural resources in a given area leads to inefficiency and leads to wage slavery and rent-seeking. Btw here\u2019s a quote from \u201c*Our Enemy, The State*\u201d:\n\n&gt; AFTER conquest and confiscation have been effected, and the State set up, its first concern is with the land.

Since surely the Surplus value that would normaly go to the capitalist in a business, would instead be shared out amongst the employees of the coop, does that not mean that a coop should have higher paid employees than a normal business and therefore due to market forces, be the job that people would more likely choose, plus the added incentive of having some control over your workplace.\n\nThe only major problems that i can see, that works against the creation of coops, is that, say i am Bill Gates, i could either start a business and make billions or create a coop and make very little. The other problem is that a bank is probably more likely to invest in a business than a coop. What are the other problems?\n\nPersonally, i think that if we really want anarchism to take of, we need to show that democratic control of the work place is better than what we have now. To do this, we are going to need to see alot more sucessful coops.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Why aren't there more successful coops within capitalism?"}

I [just read this article and saw a lot of discussiion about it in practically ever peer group](https://www.salon.com/2018/03/18/some-millennials-arent-saving-for-retirement-because-they-do-not-think-capitalism-will-exist-by-then/) and was blown away not only by the unprecidented amount of people that truly understand socialism but also those who support it and were willing to defend it and fix people's perceptions. I've noticed a handful of threads here on Reddit where practically all the top comments where people proclaiming the failure of capitalism and the need for socialism. In these people are saying what I've been saying for decades: Socialism is workplace democracy. The USSR was never communist or truly socialist. People are bringing up Einstein*, Orwelll, etc all as supporters of it. I'm even seeing references to anarchist catalonia (!!!). \n\nYesterday evening it was leaked on the news that Trump called Putin and congratulated him on the election without bringing up the assassinations, psychological blitzkreig on US elections, etc. Combined with the Cambridge Analytica exposing, there is no denying his loyalty to one of the most disgusting examples of \"Money and Power Breed Corruption\" in the world, Putin. Liberal Democracy is a failure. Capitalism is a failure. It goes without saying Trump is the living embodiment of Capitalism, and I don't think this is slipping a lot of people's minds.\n\nThe upcoming months, weeks, and even days are going to be some of the most important for us as Anarchists. Unfortunately somehow even after Bush and Obama, a lot of people who otherwise seem to be very sharp are recommending voting for democrats as the best solution ... We need to have a discussion about what we should be doing right now. I truly think some commonly held strategies amongst radicals have been complete failures over the past decade or two: an aire of elitism and ivory tower snobbishness have alienated many who grew up poor, lacking access to education, or otherwise not being fluent in the outlandish lexicon many of us use. I feel our (and I take responsibility as well) failure to communicate framework theories of intersectionality/privilege/oppression have led fascism being able to take hold of many working class people. I really don't want the discussion to be derailed into a tangent discussing this (which is part of the problem I'm talking about) so I'll leave it there. All I am trying to say is we should take a moment to crtiically think about the condition of the world today, our individual and collective ability to affect it, and come up with a series of strategies and respective tactics. \n\nTLDR: End in Sight.

However, many of these critiques are quite superficial and argue that say Facebook is say under regulated. Others take a more anti-technology view and just give up on the idea of social networking entirely, which is also problematic from our perspective because modern communication technology makes anarchy in reach. Neither of these ideas get to the root of the problem. Fundamentally, the content users create through their labour on a social network is what makes it useful (working in tandem with the work of the engineers). Facebook then takes this user content and attaches targeted ads to them based on all the work users do and the data they volunteer. Their business model is essentially founded on stealing user\u2019s work, which is what makes their platform interesting in the first place, and then turns around then steals their data. Furthermore, Facebook gets to dictatorially make content policy decisions and users don\u2019t have much recourse because of the network effect associated with social media. We have to then extend this to a critique of Web 2.0 in general. We should then push for more P2P/decentralized/federated/user-controlled social networks (i.e. [social.coop](https://social.coop) and mastodon in general) as an alternative institution that doesn\u2019t have the same flaws as Facebook. Arguments can be made against simply regulating facebook because balancing the incentives just right with regulation proves quite tricky and states are not always effective at applying regulation.

When the demonstration had ended, some music was being played from a truck while people slowly dissolved. A group of protesters were attacked on their way home. The attackers used knives, axes and hammers in the attack, but only wounded a few people lightly. Three were arrested.\n\nA major state news outlet wrote an article about the attack, i translated it for you guys. Original article [here](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/politi-anholder-tre-efter-voldsomt-overfald-i-koebenhavn):\n\n# Cops arrest three after violent assault in Copenhagen\n\n**After a demonstration against the regime in Turkey, a group were attacked at Vesterbro Torv in Copenhagen**\n\nAccording to guard chief Henrik Moll, Copenhagen Police Department moved out this afternoon to a violent assault at Vesterbro Torv in Copenhagen. According to Moll, three was arrested in connection with the assault.\n\nThe assault took place almost immediately after a demonstration on R\u00e5dhuspladsen, where protesters protested against Erdogans regime in Turkey.\n\n- \"It might be some people from the demonstration\", says the chief guard to Ritzau.\n\n**Attacked with hammer, axe and knives**\n\nCops estimate that around 25 people were involved in the assault, and there are reports that clubs were taken in use. \n\n- \"As we were leaving the demonstration, multiple protesters were attacked by a group of 8 to 10 people with hammers, axes and knives at Vesterbrogade 24\", says Saime Bilen, spokesman for the demonstration, to DR News.\n\nSupposedly, nobody has been severely hurt in connection with the attack.\n\n**Spokesman: Shaken at the situation**\n\nThe demonstration went under the name \"Afrin is not alone\", with reference to the city Afrin, where many Kurds live. Turkeys army and The Free Syrian Army took control of the city sunday.\n\nSaime Bilen says that the demonstration started at Vesterbro Torv, and went to R\u00e5dhuspladsen from there.\n\nHere the demonstration proceeded peacefully, according to spokesperson.\n\nA little while later, some of the protesters headed for Vesterbro Torv, where they were attacked, she says. She heard loud yelling from the area, and when she arrived she saw that some of the protesters had been attacked.\n\n- \"We could see, that one had been wounded in the head. I'm shaken at the situtation,\" says Saime Bilen to Ritzau.\n\nShe elaborates further to DR News:\n\n- \"It's the first time that i experience peaceful Kurds being attacked like this.\"\n\nHenrik Moll confirms, that there has been found multiple weapons in the area. \n\nDR News were not able to obtain commentary from the group that attacked the protesters.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"\"Afrin is not alone\" protesters in Copenhagen attacked with knives, axes, clubs and hammers on their way home"}

I'm also very much opposed to the NRA.\n\nNonetheless, right now I'm pissed WRT the anarchist community's response to the gun control question. There's a quote from the *communisateur* Gilles Dauv\u00e9:\n\n&gt;There is no such thing as a peaceful insurrection. Weapons are necessary: it\u2019s a question of doing everything possible to make using them unnecessary. An insurrection is more about taking up arms and maintaining an \u201carmed presence\u201d than it is about armed struggle. We need to distinguish clearly between being armed and the use of arms. Weapons are a constant in revolutionary situations, but their use is infrequent and rarely decisive at key turning points: August 10th 1792, March 18th 1871, October 1917. When power is in the gutter, it\u2019s enough to walk over it.\n\n&gt;Because of the distance that separates us from them, weapons have taken on a kind of double character of fascination and disgust that can be overcome only by handling them. An authentic pacifism cannot mean refusing weapons, but only refusing to use them. Pacifism without being able to fire a shot is nothing but the theoretical formulation of impotence. Such a priori pacifism is a kind of preventive disarmament, a pure police operation. In reality, the question of pacifism is serious only for those who have the ability to open fire. In this case, pacifism becomes a sign of power, since it\u2019s only in an extreme position of strength that we are freed from the need to fire.\n\nI think that it is perhaps possible to end state power without blood, but it is impossible without guns. A gun, as Orwell, Marx and Newton were all aware (and don't let you think I'm a demsoc, Marxist or Maoist) is an important tool that enables a single person to defend themselves, and a group of people to pose a serious threat. Of course the state will outgun us at every turn, but this has hardly mattered; armed insurrectionists have won out against hugely powerful states, and the state is rarely hesitant to use their great power against defenseless people if they see it fit. All the acclaimed pacifists of the 20th century have been backed by guns.\n\nSome people are willing to believe, and I'm really worried by this belief, that due to the overwhelming popular support for gun control today, we must acquiesce to gun control. This kind of thinking is an echo of the worst aspects of liberal-democratic thought, and seems to argue that a mass movement's desperate cries to please take all our guns away! are worth abandoning our principles for. I don't need a mass movement to justify my love of anarchy. I don't need to sublimate my armed desire into a pretty package of anarcho-liberalism and peacenik sit-ins so I can repeat the Boomer's pacifist failings.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"The reason I feel so angry right now"}

Every member of modern industrial society, he noted, benefits from (I quote) \u201can immense capital accumulated by those who have gone before him\u201d (The Conquest of Bread [1892] 1995, 11). And among those wealth-creating predecessors, he paid special attention to poor and working people and their sufferings:\n\n\u201cWhole generations, that lived and died in misery, oppressed and ill-treated by their masters, and worn out by toil, have handed on this immense inheritance\u201d (The Conquest of Bread [1892] 1995, 14). Yet the descendants of those who paid this terrible price, instead of being treated as the inheritors of a vast richness, are denied any property rights at all. For all the vast wealth produced by modern railways, for instance, \u201cif the children of those who perished by the thousands while excavating the railway cuttings and tunnels were to assemble one day, crowding in their rags and hunger, to demand bread from the shareholders, they would be met with bayonets and grapeshot\u201d ([1892] 1995, 17).\n\nMost importantly (especially if you're a post-work person), Kropotkin does not say that such a person deserves a share of wealth because he or she works a certain amount. On the contrary, the entire production apparatus must be treated as a single, common inheritance. I therefore deserve a share of production not because I labor but because I own (via inheritance) a share of the entire production apparatus. Kropotkin appeals to labor, to be sure, but not just the labor of the present.\n\nInstead, it is past labor that is most fundamentally the source of the productive apparatus that we all inherit, so the heritage of labor is as important as its current condition. What is more, he grounds the right to a common inheritance not just in a long, shared history of work but equally in other historical accumulations such as inventions as well as forms of suffering, deprivation, and bloodshed . In this broad panorama, which encompasses the whole history of all of mankind, there can be no accounting of who produced how much or whose suffering was greater; the only practical as well as ethical conclusion is, as he put it, \u201cAll belongs to all\u201d ([1892] 1995), 19).\n\nKropotkin always insisted on starting with distribution and claims of distributive justice. Why is capitalism unjust? One must begin with a historical account of where wealth comes from (here, I quote):\n\n\"For thousands of years millions of men have laboured to clear the forests, to drain the marshes, and to open up highways by land and water. Every rood of soil we cultivate in Europe has been watered by the sweat of several races of men. Every acre has its story of enforced labor, of intolerable toil, of the people\u2019s suffering. Every mile of railway, every yard of tunnel, has received its share of human blood. . . . Millions of human beings have laboured to create this civilization on which we pride ourselves today. Other millions, scattered through the globe, labour to maintain it. Without them, nothing would be left in fifty years but ruins. . . . There is not even a thought, or an invention, which is not common property, born of the past and the present. . . . By what right then can anyone whatever appropriate the least morsel of this immense whole and say\u2014This is mine, not yours? \"(Kropotkin [1892] 1995, 14\u201316)\n\nAnd the political conclusion, for Kropotkin, followed directly (in words that sound oddly tuned to our own times, in spite of the fact that they were written in 1892): \"We must recognize, and loudly proclaim, that everyone, whatever his grade in the old society, whether strong or weak, capable or incapable, has, before everything, the right to live, and that society is bound to share amongst all, without exception, the means of existence it has at its disposal. . . . A \u201cright to well-being\u201d means the possibility of living like human beings, and of bringing up children to be members of a society better than ours, whilst the \u201cright to work\u201d only means the right to be always a wage-slave, a drudge, ruled over and exploited by the middle class of the future. The right to well-being is the social revolution, the right to work means nothing but the treadmill of commercialism. (Kropotkin [1892] 1995, 28, 30)\n\nIt is not the worker (as worker) whose claims are prioritized here but he member of society, the inheritor of a great common estate (in which each and every one of us has a share). It is not just labor that founds that inheritance, in this view, but also things like suffering, bloodshed, ingenuity, and shared experience; it is therefore the entire society that is the source of value.\n\nHe suggests that the material riches of the modern era had to be understood as a kind of inheritance from millennia of experimentation and innovation.\n\nKropotkin expressed the claims of inherited suffering when he touches on the legacies of mining:\n\n\"The shafts of the mine still bear on their rocky walls the marks made y the pick of the workman who toiled to excavate them. The space between each prop in the underground galleries might be marked as a miner\u2019s grave; and who can tell what each of these graves has cost, in tears, in privations, in unspeakable wretchedness, to the family who depended on the scanty wage of the worker cut off in his prime by firedamp, rockfall, or flood. ([1892] 1995, 14)\n\nNor is this only a matter of the structural violence of the mining industry. Across a host of domains, contemporary claims are grounded in past suffering and past contributions that require redress or compensation to the current generation. Indeed, claims to social payments and social services today are commonly grounded not only in production (\u201cI am worthy because I have worked hard all my life\u201d) and reproduction (\u201cI deserve it because I am raising five kids\u201d) but also in past injuries (\u201cWe struggled against apartheid,\u201d \u201cWe are descended from those who lost their land,\u201detc.), injuries which are often understood as both collective and inherited across generations.\n\nThe fundamental idea is that wealth, being the product of social labor, social suffering, and social innovation, should be in some way shared by society as a whole.\n\nI personally think that Kropotkin gets to the heart of things by grounding rights to distribution not in productive labor at all but in an unconditional claim of ownership. In his account, I don\u2019t deserve to receive goods because I produce them; I deserve a share of production because I own (as an inheritance) a share of the entire production apparatus and its output.\n\nIn short:\n\nKropotkin argues that value is produced by society as a whole, that all members of society should be regarded as shareholders in a collective enterprise, and that everyone thus has a right to a share of the total social product.\n\nOn play:\n\nPeter Kropotkin, interestingly, paid some attention to the concept of \u2018play\u2019, observing animals, he identified play as a creative activity that is a form of pleasure in itself, while also being part of the activity of building community and relations of mutual aid:\n\n\"We know at the present time that all animals, beginning with the ants, going on to the birds, and ending with the highest mammals, are fond of plays, wrestling, running after each other, trying to capture each other, teasing each other, and so on.

Initially, my plan is to compare and contrast three eras and styles of revolution - the art and history of the Paris Commune, Revolutionary Catalonia, and Freetown Christiana.

The end goal though, is to humanize anti-fascist action and thought to people through the lens of art.  Anarchist art and authors helped changed the way I think about the world and I would like to share that realization with others.\n\nI'd go to Rojava, but I think my wife would kill me, lol.

That said, it is looking like I have the support of my instructor, and could potentially make this happen.

I think that all our efforts are in vain.\n\nThe people....far too many of the people believe in the legitimacy of the state. They see us as criminals. God forbid you're an ancom. Just being associated with the word \"communism\" seems like public relations suicide, because so many people think that communism is Stalinism and the USSR. I realise that that perception is not as common in some places as it is in others, but it is still pretty prevalent.\n\nHow do we get people to actually sit down, and educate themselves about our beliefs when they're so certain of the truth of the preconceived notions that they have? You wear all black and start protesting, and people already dismiss you as being \"entitled\" and anti-democracy. You get into altercations with the police, and you're viewed as a vandal who just wants to cause disorder and chaos. Many people are heavily attached to the false, largely American idea that the free market and capitalism are the foundation of freedom. How do you make people step back from these views and see the way things are?\n\nThere is also a further problem with the desire for wealth. People aspire to be a part of the upper classes. The vast majority of people, in my view, don't really care about creating an equitable society. They just want to have a better life for themselves, because the selfish logic of the system has warped their perception of what it is to live a good life.\n\nOn the subject of revolution, it is my view that the only thing that gets the people to organise and protest/riot is hunger. Not ideology, not a vision of a better society, but hunger. This is a serious problem because it means that most people are happy to accept the state so long as they have food to eat, a place to stay and a promise of a reasonably decent life. Once people have these things, you can discuss anarchy with them till you turn blue in the face and they won't care. The peoples politics has always been (as they say in my country) a \"politics of the stomach\", and I simply don't see how that is going to change.\n\nThe only possible end I see to the state, is ecological disaster on a scale so large that it cannot possibly function.\n\nI'm eager to hear the thoughts of everyone on this.

For a long time I struggled to find a way to do that, and after a lot of trial and error I think I\u2019ve found something that works. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat\u2019s worked for me is  to start with talking about the American Revolution. First off, everyone who grows up in the US learns about it in school, and it\u2019s constantly beaten into us by all levels of media and public holidays. By default, most of us have a positive take on the American Revolution, and how could it be otherwise? Okay fine, there are people who go through elite educational institutions or who participate in certain activist subcultures that will immediately start talking about the racist, white supremacist patriarchal origins of the USA, but those people are already on the left. But for almost everyone else, it\u2019s a great place to start. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe question is, how to talk about it from a socialist perspective? The answer is to focus on the hidden history of the American Revolution as a struggle not just against \u201cno taxation without representation,\u201d but also a struggle by working people against rapacious landlords and merchants.  One way to do this is by examing the basic ground level institutions of the revolution \u2014 the [committees of safety](https://goo.gl/pmj8Jz). These were the directly democratic structures that organized the revolution. As Murray Bookchin writes in *The Third Revolution* \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;The American Revolution was to innovate very remarkable revolutionary institutions, many of which were to resurface in popular uprisings throughout the world\u2026 one of the most remarkable of these .. was the network of revolutionary committees that emerged at every level of society, which were to constitute the authentic engine of the Revolution.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe Committees of Safety handled the boycott of British goods organized by the revolutionaries, and were made up of local people. They published names of people who broke the boycott at first, but often became new revolutionary governments in parallel with the British colonial government. As the uprising proceeded, they raised militia, elected officers and arrested suspected British loyalists. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe origin of the Committees was in the New England town meetings, the direct democratic assemblies that governed small towns where citizens together made decisions about the life of the community, directly and not through representatives. During the American Revolution as the Committees of Public Safety became the government and took over from the British authorities, they were widely popular with working people, who also sought to struggle against wealthy landowner and merchant oligarchs. People who had started electing their own militia officers and fighting the British Army soon discovered they had class interests. In places like the Carolinas, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Bookchin writes\n&gt;backcountry farmers used the opportunity presented by the Revolution to break with the established system of political privilege, and,  **arms in hand** acquire long sought rights.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOrdinary working people with rifles in their hands fought hard for economic rights starting at the very inception of the United States. \n&gt;the radicalism of the Pennsylvania militiamen assumed a highly militant form; indeed, no longer a \u201cmob,\u2019 they were now organizing politically as well as militarily . . . the uneducated soldiers learned from the radical intellectuals they met int he ranks, and privates elected the junior officers and even some of the senior officers\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn Pennsylvania the newly radicalized militiamen faced scorn, social condemnation, and lack of support from the pacifist Quaker gentry who dominated Philadelphia politics. The hostility went both ways. The gentry were exempt from paying taxes to support the militias, and, Bookchin writes that the hostility \u201cwas exacerbated by the fact that the Quaker oligarchs owned some of the largest and wealthiest estates in the province...\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn fact, the generalized uprising of the American Revolution terrified wealth merchants and landlords in none other than New York. There, the wealthy fought hard to prevent the Committees of Public Safety from undermining their privileges. Rich men tried and mostly succeeded at keeping working people out of New York\u2019s Committee, and dragging their feet at implementing a full out boycott of British goods. Just like today, New York was a center of rich politicians who made the right noises while trying hard to keep the lid of oppression firmly in place. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRemember Thomas Paine? Tea Party types loves to talk about how they\u2019re the inheritors of Paine\u2019s *Common Sense*, but what they never talk about is the fact that Paine supported the French Revolution,  and, as Sean Monahan wrote in *Jacobin Magazine*\n&gt; Paine was a consistent advocate of a strong federal government and also a sharp critic of economic inequality and poverty who designed the world\u2019s first fully fleshed-out scheme of social welfare provision. Beyond that, he introduced millions to a radical critique of private property and class society, and pointed to democratic politics as the solution.\n\n&gt;[Link](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/thomas-paine-american-revolution-common-sense/)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nOnce I\u2019ve talked about the American Revolution through a socialist lens, I\u2019ve found that people are a lot more receptive to talking about the deep contradictions of the American project. The US at once holds the legacy of  democracy and egalitarian struggle alongside patriarchal white supremacy and genocide. Most people can see that the leftist, socialist currents in the American Revolution might not have won out, but that those are still valuable and important traditions of home-grown radicalism. Most Americans grow up believing in the goodness of the American Revolution, and by affirming that goodness from a socialist perspective, my experience has been that it is easier for folks to also consider the places where the American Revolution fell very short. Contrast this with the approach favored by some in the academic-guilt-creation complex, which is to focus exclusively on the horrors of white supremacy. That method is very useful for academics fighting to make tenure, because by inflicting guilt they enhance their power in faculty meetings and journal review boards by silencing their opponents.  What they\u2019re really doing is making sure that their opponents can\u2019t advance within the capitalist power structure and access resources, with of course state violence standing behind the entire edifice.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHowever, by trying to hammer people with guilt over settler colonialism, these laughable academics effectively demobilize people. That is not what we want, given that the majority of Americans are descendants of at-least-some \u201cvoluntary\u201d immigrants. Though, even then, one wonders how \u201cvoluntary\u201d immigration was by  whites or Asians living in poverty in their home countries. If our goal is socialist revolution in a country that is still majority white, it is unclear to me how it is an effective strategy to demobilize white people who are otherwise favorable to the left. Fuck guilt, and fuck demobilization. Moreover, while decolonization might be a useful practice for individuals in reconciling themselves with a wider white supremacist society, it is not a practical political program for anything other than setting up ethnostates. As /u/Communizer wrote in an  /r/socialism [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/81q9ne/hello_rsocialism_were_the_founders_of_black/dv4w1m7/):\n&gt;I just don't see how it could be established outside of either a banner of Balkanized micro-states or the real movement of communism/socialism that moves beyond all social differentiation and unites people along the common cause of abolishing class society.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow some might say that talking about the American revolutionary tradition and guns is foolish because \u201csomething something Scandinavian social democracy, wealth funds, Denmark is the happiest country on earth and only USians care about guns dur dur muh red liberal irony.\u201d\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThose people are fucking ignorant and we should actively call them out as foolish simpletons at every possible opportunity. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere\u2019s the \u201cHappiest Country on Earth\u201d as of February 2018:\n&gt;The Danish government plans to double the penalties for crimes committed in deprived \"ghetto\" areas, where immigrant numbers are above-average.\nIt is part of a drive to have \"no more ghettos by 2030\", Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said. The government lists 22 areas as \"ghettos\", where more than 50% of residents are non-Western immigrants. The plan would let local police chiefs impose double punishments for some crimes, such as vandalism or theft.\n\n&gt;[Link](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43214596)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn reality, Denmark and the other Scandinavian social democratic states are revealing themselves as havens for white supremacy, now that they have significant numbers of Black and Brown immigrants. It is the European nation-state that is the problem, because it is inextricably intertwined with what Cedric Robinson called racial capitalism. Scholar Robin D.G. Kelley explains:\n\n&gt;So what did Robinson mean by \u201cracial capitalism\u201d? Building on the work of another forgotten black radical intellectual, sociologist Oliver Cox, Robinson challenged the Marxist idea that capitalism was a revolutionary negation of feudalism. Instead **capitalism emerged within the feudal order and flowered in the cultural soil of a Western civilization already thoroughly infused with racialism. Capitalism and racism, in other words, did not break from the old order but rather evolved from it to produce a modern world system of \u201cracial capitalism\u201d dependent on slavery, violence, imperialism, and genocide.**Capitalism was \u201cracial\u201d not because of some conspiracy to divide workers or justify slavery and dispossession, but because racialism had already permeated Western feudal society \u2026**Robinson suggested that racialization within Europe was very much a colonial process involving invasion, settlement, expropriation, and racial hierarchy. Insisting that modern European nationalism was completely bound up with racialist myths, he reminds us that the ideology of Herrenvolk (governance by an ethnic majority) that drove German colonization of central Europe and \u201cSlavic\u201d territories \u201cexplained the inevitability and the naturalness of the domination of some Europeans by other Europeans.\u201d** To acknowledge this is not to diminish anti-black racism or African slavery, but rather to recognize that capitalism was not the great modernizer giving birth to the European proletariat as a universal subject, and the \u201ctendency of European civilization through capitalism was thus not to homogenize but to differentiate\u2014to exaggerate regional, subcultural, and dialectical differences into \u2018racial\u2019 ones.\u201d\n\n&gt;[Link](http://bostonreview.net/race/robin-d-g-kelley-what-did-cedric-robinson-mean-racial-capitalism)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYet whiny red liberals and their overseas enablers will continue to pontificate about how much the US could look like Scandinavia if we just opened up a giant sovereign wealth fund and banned guns. They ignore the fact that under racial capitalism, when the white European nation-states they idolize have come into contact with people of color, they have gravitated towards white supremacist policies like disproportionately punishing ethnic minority neighborhoods. While there are ultra-right Islamist currents among some immigrant communities in Scandinavia, the white-nationalist nature of the nation-state means that attempts to \u201csort\u201d the \u201cgood\u201d immigrants from the \u201cbad\u201d immigrants are inevitably tinged with white nationalism. Opportunities for those same ethnic minorities to exercise last-ditch autonomy via firearm are of course foreclosed by intense normalization of state-violence-worship culture. It\u2019s my understanding that there is a move in Denmark to ban knives with points (!) similar to the one that has emerged in the [United Kingdom](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/840634/Ban-kitchen-knives-pointed-doctor-deadly-knife-crime).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThese same red liberals also love to assail the United States for our terrible \u201ccowboy gun culture,\u201d which they claim is just another excuse for white supremacy. In doing so, the red liberals and their enablers are the *real racists* because they completely erase the actually-existing-history of working cowboys in the US \u2014 that the cowboys were mostly Black and Latino. Approximately one in four cowboys were black:\n\n&gt;In his 1907 autobiography, cowboy Nat Love recounts stories from his life on the frontier so clich\u00e9, they read like scenes from a John Wayne film. He describes Dodge City, Kansas, a town smattered with the romanticized institutions of the frontier: \u201ca great many saloons, dance halls, and gambling houses, and very little of anything else.\u201d He moved massive herds of cattle from one grazing area to another, drank with Billy the Kid and participated in shootouts with Native peoples defending their land on the trails. And when not, as he put it, \u201cengaged in fighting Indians,\u201d he amused himself with activities like \u201cdare-devil riding, shooting, roping and such sports.\u201d\n\n&gt;Though Love\u2019s tales from the frontier seem typical for a 19th-century cowboy, they come from a source rarely associated with the Wild West. Love was African-American, born into slavery near Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n&gt;Few images embody the spirit of the American West as well as the trailblazing, sharpshooting, horseback-riding cowboy of American lore. And though African-American cowboys don\u2019t play a part in the popular narrative, historians estimate that one in four cowboys were black. \n\n&gt;[Link](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/lesser-known-history-african-american-cowboys-180962144/)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nRoughly 1/3 of cowboys in the late 19th Century were Mexican:\n&gt;One out of every three cowboys in the late 1800s was the Mexican vaquero, says Kendall Nelson, a photographer from Idaho whose recent book, Gathering Remnants: A Tribute to the Working Cowboy, showcases the few remaining cowboys of the West. Nelson is currently working on a documentary of the same title, capping an eight-year documentation of the last cowboys.\n\n&gt;The story of Nelson's photos and Costner's Open Range really begins in the Southwest, two decades before the pilgrims landed in 1620 on Plymouth Rock, &gt;when adventurous criollos (Spanish-born Americans) and &gt;mestizos (mixed Spanish and Indian settlers) pushed past the Rio Grande River to take advantage &gt;of land grants in the kingdom of New Mexico, which included most of the western states.\n\n&gt;[Link](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/08/0814_030815_cowboys.html)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSpeaking of John Wayne, he was part of the early 20th Century whitewashing of the cowboy/Western culture. The film industry took root in Southern California in the 1910s. This area had historically been part of New Spain, and then Mexico. For quite some years after California became a state in the 19th Century, Latino, Spanish-speaking elites continued to be elected to local town and county offices. However, as the 20th Century began, if you look at the [rolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Common_Council) of the [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_City_Council,_1889\u20131909) City [Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_City_Council) you can see the Spanish names falling away, as Anglo settlers carried out a policy of subjugating Latinos and indigenous people. Los Angeles would not have another Latino City Council member until [1949](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_R._Roybal#City_Council).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nObviously there was a class/racial tension here as well between the Spanish settler landowning oligarchs and the indigenous/mestizo people who worked for them, and who were, in some cases, as in New Mexico, [enslaved](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/us/indian-slaves-genizaros.html).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut it would be a mistake to overlook the considerable autonomy that people exercised across the West simply because of geography and force of arms. The power of state violence was thin on the ground because there was so much ground to cover. For example, Arizona and New Mexico didn\u2019t become states until 1912. Autonomy was so significant in the Southwest that in the 1950s, [Reies L\u00f3pez Tijerina](http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/fifty-years-after-courthouse-confrontation-emotions-remain-raw/article_c94690f8-3f46-58f7-b0bb-3a44c019e82b.html) was able to [organize a  Chicano land rights movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reies_Tijerina#Flight) while spending 7 years as a fugitive across the Southwest. As late as the 1980s, some of the land rights activists maintained an armed camp for 16 months, and ultimately succeeded in gaining a couple hundred acres of land. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSome might say that the autonomous legacy represented by \u201ccowboy\u201d culture had no role for women. But this is not true \u2014 women did take autonomous armed action. For example in Albany, California, near to the University of California,  a group of armed women literally blockaded streets to stop haulers from dumping trash in their town at the height of a rat/plague outbreak. Although they had complained that the stench and flies from the garbage were unbearable, the local authorities ignored their complaints. A group of women armed with \u201cshotguns, revolvers, clubs and clods of earth\u201d [blockaded the streets](https://patch.com/california/albany/albany-s-forgotten-garbage-war) in a standoff with the trash haulers and the police. Eventually the neighborhood broke away and formed a new city where they banned trash dumping in city limits. H.C. Hanscomb, one of the women told a reporter \"My folks are fighters from way back. My grandfather was a fighter in the French and Indian War. Then just tell me why I should not be a fighter. These garbage men will discover that we are all fighters before they finish up the matter.\u201d It seems very likely that there are many more stories of such armed autonomous actions by women in the West, erased by the 1950s patriarchal Hollywood studio system. Today, though, almost all of us carry access to the world\u2019s information in our pocket. We can unearth the buried stories of armed autonomy by women, communities of color, and working people \u2014 the best parts of the American revolutionary tradition. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nFrom one perspective the revolutionary and autonomous traditions of the United States,  as exemplified by the rifle, are outdated in this era of smartphones and Instagram videos.  After all, it  was the torrent of police shootings captured on phone camera video that caused many white Americans to finally acknowledge the reality of pervasive anti-Blackness in the security services. Yet, in Charlottesville we discovered that cell phones don\u2019t stop white nationalists from doing physical harm to people, and it was Redneck Revolt, an armed leftist organization that escorted worshippers from a prayer meeting when white supremacists advanced towards the church.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe liberal focus on witness and pacifism via the smartphone is really just a throwback to the arguments between the Pennsylvania militiamen and the Quaker oligarchs. Except this time, it\u2019s rich coastal technocrats hiding behind armed bodyguards and the police condemning a newly resurgent left that is arming itself for autonomy. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLast time around, the oligarchs and patriarchal white supremacy prevailed. But the future is uncertain and perhaps, another time, with rifles in our hands and phones in our pockets, we can write a more inclusive story.

As stated before, this is not a debate sub. R/socialism gives a space for **SOCIALISTS**; not anyone with a political opinion, liberals, conservatives, and those curious (although those genuinely curious will also have their space available soon, and so long as a they are *polite*). Those who want to challenge/debate/learn more about socialism can visit our sidebar, and can go to r/socialism_101.\n\nSocialism has a list of basic tenets that are not up for **debate**, not because of our love of censorship, but because of an overwhelming density of materials has already written, debated, and analyzed that has become imbedded within our thought and philosophy. Some of these basic tenets include:\n\n\n- Minimum wage/ elimination of wage labor\n\n\n- Pro-union/Labor, anti-classism, anti-business (debate about worker-co-ops are okay)\n\n\n- Pro-immigration; pro-feminism; pro-LBGTQ; anti-racism, stereotyping, scapegoating, and bigotry\n\n\n- Anti-fascist (antifa), pro-self/community defense (gun control debates are okay), anti-police, and anti-hate speech\n\n\n- Anti ~~Western~~Imperialism, anti-neoliberalism, anti-militarization~~,~~ *.* ~~pro~~ *As* *socialists* *we* *are* *sympathetic* *towards* Cuba, Venezuelan Revolution (debates about Maduro are okay), Bolivia, Vietnam, *Palestine*, USSR (debates about Stalin *and* *social* *policies* are okay), and the DPRK (debates about China and Afrin to determine whether they are truly communistic/socialist are okay).\n\n\n- Anti-Trump/Hillary (Bernie Sanders can also be lumped into this because he is an actor of the capitalist state (along with a not so stellar voting record). However, r/socialism has acknowledged his historical advocacy of socialism, and his impact on modern socialism because of his campaign. Thus, although Bernie posts are generally not allowed, specific actions/philosophical discussions from him/his campaign are okay).\n\nWe are going to clamp down on liberals/liberal sympathizers and other reactionary comments and posts. This ranges from removing posts, to issuing temporary or permanent bans. In addition to this clean-up, we are adding a \"Mod Review\" process for users. Knowing that there may be trolls/brigades, mods will take steps to ensure transparency, yet preserve the authenticity of the sub from being sabotaged or hijacked. With that said, If there is a mod who conducts themselves in a manner that does not align with socialism, users can do the following:\n\n1. Send a message to the mods (as a whole) concerning the individual mod, detailing their issue and providing link(s) to the specific incident.\n\n2. Another mod (not in question) will respond within 1-3 days, either acknowledging the message, or denying the request (with reasonable explanation why), and a review of the mod-in-question will take place, which may include (but not limited to) reviewing the comment/posts/behavior, giving time for the mod-in-question to respond, and analyzing gravity of the sitation.\n\n3. A decision will be made within 14 days after the acknowledgement message has been sent. A mod will reach out to the user who sent the message detailing the steps taken and final disciplinary action.\n\n4. A biannual report (One in February and another in July of each year) will be given to all users concerning these messages/reports. This report will include the following: a. Number of reports b. Description of each report c. Decision from each report d. Date/Time What will not be given are the usernames of the mods.\n\nWe will also have our annual survey of users up this year as well. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns regarding this. Solidarity Comrades.\n\n**Edit**: There has been concern about the rigidness of these tenets, specifically with the USSR and DPRK. The term \"debate\", rather than \"discussion\" has been purposefully used within the context of this subreddit. The USSR/DPRK are not perfect, nor are these tenets portraying them to be. However, without understanding how the threat of imperialism, infiltration, and sabotage has created and influenced their politics, along with other variables (sanctions, cultural history, influence of western propaganda), an authentic critique is difficult to attain and possibly misleading. Discussion regarding the nuances of specific policy within a country is permitted, but an overall critique of the country without strong analysis of the information above is not okay. *We* *also* *acknowledge* *the* *stances* *of* *libertarian/anarcho/a* *socialists* *and* *their* *stances* *on* *the* *state* *as* *well*, *and* *although* *they* *may* *not* *share* *these* *sympathies*, *they* *are* *still* *welcomed*.\n\nWith this said we have made the following changes above with ~~strikethroughs~~ and *italics*. \n\n**Edit 2:** We have been engaging with users as much as possible and trying to parse out from the dialogue legitimate concerns. Our commitment to socialism through this announcement  is excluding any liberal interpretation that detracts from our subreddit. If this was not the case, we would have been flooded with Bernie/fake liberal \"progressivism\" a long time ago. There are teachable moments in r/socialism, but as stated before, this is a space for socialist. Learning and debating subs with socialism are available, and our sidebar is an educational tool as well for the subreddit. Our subreddit has been brigaded and is always susceptible to trolls, reactionaries, and liberals that attempt to take our openness for \"teaching\" into unwarranted debates that do not add to our community experience. We are trying to combat all this, yet engage with users with ways to improve the sub with their voices.  Also, this is in by no means attempting to isolating our libertarian/anarchist comrades, and are committed to their causes concerning the state as well. \n\nEdit 3: \"Debate\" and \"discussion\" are two separate terms that were purposefully used in this announcement to differentiate socialists from liberals. Discussing these tenets are allowed, but underminding them through debate is not.\n\nExample:\n\nDiscussion: Maduro has not been an effective leader for Venezuela and is riding on Chavez legacy to allow corruption of most governmental posts. Here's some unbias sources to back this.\n\nDebate: Maduro needs to be overthrown by anything and anyone because people are starving. Maybe socialism isn't effective in Venezuela. I am saying this because I saw a thread from r/pics saying this and seeing protesters fight police.\n\nSee how there is sympathy with one, yet discusses the problems with a certain country? And do you see how liberals can debate without any credible sources that undermind the progress of socialism?\n\nThis is what we are trying to combat. We are not trying to restrict discussion on these tenets; just debate that underminds them.","subreddit":"socialism","title":"NO MORE LIBERALISM.

I'm disappointed to see a lot of you latching onto it.\n\nNearly overnight Emma Gonzalez and David Hogg became the iconic face of the moment. They're children - and what's more, survivors of a horrific trauma - which makes them extremely sympathetic figures.\n\nThe advantage (and by extension, the danger) in being a sympathetic figure is that noone looks into your background. It's largely been ignored that the March for Our Lives has a white supremacist platform on not just gun control, but all of its auxiliary issues as well - pushing policies and attitudes that have actively harmed (and continue to actively harm) PoC, poor, neuro-divergent, and queer folk in disproportionately large numbers from open state oppression, to the school-to-prison pipeline, to wonky juvie practises, to selective enforcement, to profiling, and many other issues. The fact that they have been blatantly infiltrated by the police is largely lauded and celebrated instead of condemned. And the racist origins of March's funding has been ignored too (y'all didn't think this shit was free, did you?), which came from ex-Mayor Bloomberg's non-profit Everytown... and for context, Bloomberg was the man who just a few years ago recently and proudly pushed for the racist \"stop and frisk\" policy in NYC and has openly defended NYPD brutality under his administration - all of these white supremacist roots and more have largely been ignored almost in perfect totality by the March's supporters.\n\nEmma Gonzalez herself comes from a slave-driving plantation-owning ex-bourgeoisie Cuban family and David Hogg is the son of an FBI agent (and no, I'm not being a conspiracy theorist, look it up - this is public and reported knowledge - David was in the news recently for defending his dad's work when Trump took to Twitter to attack the FBI a while back). They both live in an upper-middle class school district that largely shields them via class privilege from the issues and struggles that normally radicalise working-class people - and *this* is who the liberals have chosen to attach to and uplift on this issue? Not the countless dying, marginalised, working-class people that have been protesting these issues going decades back?\n\nIt's really quite ingenious, though - with Gonzalez and Hogg being children, and not just children but children of a horrific and very public trauma - all of this makes them very hard to attack. Not to mention Gonzalez's ethnicity automatically activates white guilt in the more elitist liberal circles (the ones pushing this movement and giving it platform, that is). The amount of social capital these two are accruing relatively overnight is incredible.\n\nLiberals are truly insidious when it comes to helping cops and white supremacists infiltrate movements, and they are actually playing their politics perfectly here. I don't see anyone willing to attack these children that haven't been ripped to shreds by white-guilted pig-loving Dems, who every time they shout \"what about the children\" further solidifies the culture of white supremacy attached to this gun control issue. It's honestly horrifying to watch. Even some so-called leftists are showering these kids in sympathy and praise.\n\nIt's like this hegemonic wave is sweeping the nation and we're powerless to stop it. And it is mortifying to witness happening in live action.\n\nMarginalised children have been dying since long before any of us reading this were alive. We (as a society) have ignored it, ignored it, ignored it until the issue marginally (no pun) affected a random mostly-white corner of middle-class suburbia that bore a feel-good movement that was openly infiltrated from DAY ONE by the very people's perpetuating this violence in the first place. And NOW we as a society choose to get excited about this issue? When it is backed by white supremacists and middle class kids...? What's that say about the kind of society we are?\n\nThis is the state of liberalism in America today. And it's why you won't catch actual leftists within 1000 feet of this sham of a movement. It deserves to be called out at every turn. What these kids are doing and how our society is treating them compared to others doing similar work is indefensible, unconscionable, and should be rebuked not celebrated at every given opportunity.\n\nEDIT: I got so excited about everything else that I forgot to include the parts about both Gonzalez *AND* Hogg encouraging each other on Twitter with multiple cited quotes from Pres. Reagan while they moved to demonise mentally ill people in the name of their new movement. Honestly, everything about this movement is problematic enough we could all go on about it for days. I can't keep adding more stuff - we need a master post on this somewhere.\n\nI the person posting this did not write it.\nEdit: oh wait, this might be satire, I can't tell.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Just Saw this On Facebook and was confused over it."}

{"author":"adonis28850","created_utc":1522341584,"num_comments":12,"score":0,"selftext":"Hi all!\n\nI know this is a recurrent topic, and I have been reading a fair bit about it recently, but there are still things that trouble me, so I thought I'd share with you, and hopefully get some good opinions and comments.\n\n\nSo, I guess that regardless of some differences we all may have in what Anarchism means for each of us, there are a number of ideas we all agree with, and that form part of the core of what Anarchism is. One of these ideas is freedom, in a broad sense, and as part of it the freedom of each one to express their beliefs, no matter if those beliefs are in contrast to others. Although many people will give this different names, and will - rightly so - say that further nuances are needed, let's call this \"freedom of speech\", just for the sake of the argument.\n\n\nNow, the thing that bothers me, can be summarised in this sentence from a recent CrimethInc article (https://crimethinc.com/2017/01/26/this-is-not-a-dialogue-not-just-free-speech-but-freedom-itself):\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Obviously, anarchists should not organize against free speech. But the stranglehold of the state on the discourse of free speech seems to set the terms of the debate: either we condone censorship, or we condone state protection of our enemies and their right to organize against us and others. **This results in paradoxes, such as radicals being accused of opposing freedom for shutting down a fascist speaker.**\n\n\nAnd that last line (in bold), is where I am kind of stuck at!. I get the argument of people saying that one thing is free speech, and another thing is hate speech. Or the argument that freedom of speech can only take place in a society where we are all treated equal. Or... many other arguments that make perfect sense to me, but that are still not enough to convince me.\n\n\nSo, where I see the trouble is in the subjectivity of what is good or bad, of what is speech and what is hate, of what is an uncomfortable opinion or an aggression (verbal or physical). I am going to give you an example, that cannot be extrapolated directly to the topic I am discussing, but that hopefully will give you an idea in case I have not been clear enough of what troubles me.\nComedy. Within comedy there is the never-ending discussion of what the limits in comedy are. But, how can we define the limits, when what is offensive is something subjective? My partner is German, she does not get offended by me making jokes about Nazis and Germans, but surely other people in Germany will not laugh at my jokes, and will get offended!. So let's say that we set the limit there... but then, some people get offended by jokes about blonde women, even though I do not, so... let's lower the bar!. But hold on, some people also get offended by....... I guess you know where this is going.\n\n\nNow, as I said, this is not directly applicable to freedom of speech, and fascists talking and doing fucked up shit, but in a way is kind of related I think. We may agree that one thing is freedom of speech, and another one is to promote hate speech or a violence discourse, alright, but... who or what defines what and what not is considered to be some of these things?!\nThere are clear examples, if someone says \"all black people should die cause they are an inferior race and they got nothing to contribute to society\", well, that is pretty fucked up and most people would agree that is hate speech. But it is the more blurry and border-limit cases that trouble me! What may constitute hate speech for some, for other may be just uncomfortable opinions that they disagree with, but that consider to be tolerable.\n\n\nI don't know, this is a difficult and complex topic, or at least it seems so to my small brain, so just I hope you understood the idea I was trying to transmit, and don't get caught up in the thousand of little mistakes or inaccuracies I may have made, and just share some opinions!\n\n\nCheers.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"On Freedom of Speech"}

[Here's a screenshot of me pointing this out in /r/socialism](https://imgur.com/0do1ltE). \n\nOf course, after interacting with the individual who made the post [I was banned](https://imgur.com/a/808r0). The \"debate\" wasn't going very well for /u/bayarea415 who deleted their own posts like a coward because they weren't making much sense. [Here's a screenshot of our interaction before the ban](https://imgur.com/a/HUK5b). I stated that \"I have absolutely no sympathy for DPRK to the extent that I believe the regime should be abolished.\" Three guesses why I was banned!!\n\nI don't really care because I don't use that sub, but it's clear that they're trying to exclude anyone who isn't an avowed tankie. There's also an alleged \"libertarian\" socialist /u/jackissocool (who loves tankies) going around trying to apologize for the tankie mod's behavior and generally being a complete tool. The user is trying to redefine \"sympathaizing\" with a country to \"opposing Western imperialism\" in said country. Sympathy, in the /r/socialism announcement, denotes \"favor or support,\" as evidenced by my ban. I personally oppose Western Imperialism across the board. \n\n(For transparency, I am ex-ecofash and some of my old comments reflect that. I grew up in the deep South where I was taught certain things. I recently broke the conditioning and strongly support PoC and LGBTQ+ liberation.

In the US, (where I live), the vast majority of people are in a center right bubble. \n\nWe can\u2019t ignore them, or else their ideas fester. If we truly want social change, we have to engage with them or else we\u2019d never be able to build a mass movement.\n\nI\u2019m sure most of you know this, but I\u2019m curious as to how to do this.\n\nSee, if one simply steps into a discussion (particularly in a non-left wing forum), and brings up identity politics or critiques of capitalism, three things are inevitably going to happen:\n\n1) You will get dog-piled. It\u2019s not necessarily the quality of the arguments that are the problem (its not hard to debate the right on an argumentative level), but rather it\u2019s the tremendous amount of people whom are going to respond by spewing the same crap over and over again, and responding to all of it becomes tremendously time consuming. \n\n2) people will spew talking points at you that, while not good arguments, attract the praise of other people with similar views as your opponent. This only makes the dog piling worse. Even if you take the time to respond to each of the many talking points they bring up, they\u2019ll only repeat that talking point or bring up another bad talking point to further ramp up their support. \n\nAn example of this is victim blaming. If you talk about poverty under capitalism, they\u2019ll tell you to stop \u201cplaying the victim\u201d and to get rid of your \u201cvictim mentality\u201d, both of which are talking points that the right not only loves to make, but loves to hear, which means that no matter how good your argument is, they now have a reason (albeit a bad reason) to rationalize it away and to not engage with it. \n\n3) they\u2019ll shift the discussion. For example, if you, again, talk about structural poverty under capitalism, they\u2019ll bring up a random anecdote about how one person escaped poverty and how that somehow disproves your argument about structural poverty. Now, you\u2019re stuck in a discussion about the efficacy of anecdotes as a form of evidence and you\u2019re stuck discussing this one example instead of the actual arguments you made for why capitalism creates structural poverty. \n\nDealing with all of this is not only time consuming but draining as well. It\u2019s not a fun experience and it\u2019s frustrating to debate someone who\u2019s not listening when you need them to. \n\nSo you\u2019re stuck in a catch 22: either you undertake the Sisyphean task of trying to argue with a group of people whom are dead set on their ideas, or you don\u2019t attempt to, in which case nothing changes.\n\nAnd I understand I can never change someone\u2019s mind in an argument, but I feel there is value to at least constantly exposing them to why they\u2019re wrong and hopefully over time they change their views. However to do that I need ways to prevent them from derailing the discussion. I guess my question is how to do that.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Appropriate way to engage with the right?"}

[Here's a screenshot of me pointing this out in /r/socialism](https://imgur.com/0do1ltE). \n\nOf course, after interacting with the individual who made the post [I was banned](https://imgur.com/a/808r0). The \"debate\" wasn't going very well for /u/bayarea415 who deleted their own posts like a coward because they weren't making much sense. [Here's a screenshot of our interaction before the ban](https://imgur.com/a/HUK5b). I stated that \"I have absolutely no sympathy for DPRK to the extent that I believe the regime should be abolished.\" Three guesses why I was banned!!\n\nI don't really care because I don't use that sub, but it's clear that they're trying to exclude anyone who isn't an avowed tankie. There's also an alleged \"libertarian\" socialist /u/jackissocool (who loves tankies) going around trying to apologize for the tankie mod's behavior and generally being a complete tool. The user is trying to redefine \"sympathaizing\" with a country to \"opposing Western imperialism\" in said country. Sympathy, in the /r/socialism announcement, denotes \"favor or support,\" as evidenced by my ban. I personally oppose Western Imperialism across the board. \n\n(For transparency, I am ex-ecofash and some of my old comments reflect that. I grew up in the deep South where I was taught certain things. I recently broke the conditioning and strongly support PoC and LGBTQ+ liberation. I'm guessing they might bring it up as a smear tactic)\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Banned from /r/socialism for anti-DPRK rhetoric (first casualty)""num_comments":32,"score":86,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Drama","title":"r/socialism Demands its Users Take North Korea Seriously, an Anarchist Respectfully Declines"}

Whenever Income Inequality, bad economics and, poverty get really bad Racism comes out of nowhere. The US didn't seem to care about Racism in popular culture until after the 2008 crash. It was there before, but the media didn't sink their teeth into it until the economy tanked. I wonder if Racism is a distraction from the upper classes to divide the lower. Just like the aftermath of Bacon's Rebellion, and the Virginia Slave codes that we're designed to keep Slave Blacks and Poor Whites separate by legally separating them and also bumping up the whites slightly to make it culturally concrete. This all isn't to say that Racism doesn't exist when a economy is doing good but, just a note that it only seems relevant when an economy is bad. \n\nI can see other examples through history of this too. Nazism in Germany came out of the Treaties of Versailles and the economic collapse that resulted in Germany. \n\n[The Tulsa Race Riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_riot?wprov=sfla1) happened in 1921 before Wall Street saw the collapse but Middle America was already feeling the burn of Economic unrest. Coinciding with the return of the King Klux Klan. \n\nLooking before Bacon's Rebellion, racial definitions weren't as meaningful as Wealth. Othello was a play about a Moor (typically portrayed as Black) having a romance with a white Nobel woman. the Romans had Non-Roman Emperors.\n\nIn short Racism is mainly, a distraction from economic problems and seeing the true culprits by a conspiracy both intentional and institutional that aims to keep the poor from Realizing what's really going on. \n\nI want to keep researching this and don't claim to have every piece of context for every lead I see but, I'm posting this here to get a conversation started. I'm too busy to devote a much time as needed to get the context for every event but, I hope that I can fleshout the truth of this conspiracy eventually. I'm also posting this in the hopes that others with more time than me can pick up this research and probably do a better job than me of both researching and disseminating this information.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"I think that it's a shame that more people, especially Anarchist, don't discuss Bacon's Rebellion more."}
