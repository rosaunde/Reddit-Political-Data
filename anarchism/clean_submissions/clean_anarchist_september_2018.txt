Full text [here](https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/EntanglementOnAnarchismAndIndividualism2018).\n\n&gt;\"Criticizing this text is a struggle. It\u2019s an old book; not a tome, but hardly concise. Repetitive, contradictory, piss-poor reasoning wrapped in fair-to-middling and often ambiguous prose, it\u2019s got it all. We find within it arguments that consistency is bondage, and that reason and truth are meaningless illusions. This book encourages the principle that you can simply ignore the implications, antecedents, and interrelations of ideas you like, if these connections aren\u2019t to your liking. Stirner also has a habit of shifting abruptly between his own voice and the voice of people he completely disagrees with. Many instances are contextually clear enough that 90 % of people would read it with the same understanding. In many other instances, though, it\u2019s ambiguous and that\u2019s how you get people claiming that Stirner was a capitalist and that he was an anti-capitalist, a communist and an anti-communist, and every other damn thing plus its opposite. Personally, I think he has no serious ideas about political economy (et al.) whatsoever and so just semi-ambiguously snarks in a bunch of different directions.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;My point is that it\u2019s really hard, once you\u2019re acquainted with the book and the scene, the egoists, to write a straight forward critique, and not get pulled in many different directions, trying to respond to what Stirner says, the contradictory thing Stirner also says, and the various egoist defenses of each of these things. For example, The Ego and His Own contains the most racist prose I have ever read in the original (as opposed to say, reading a book about fascists that quotes some of their racialist trash)...Stirner is racist. He believes it is both true that caucasians are superior to other races and is rightly so.\" (p. 61).\n\n&amp;#x200B;","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"An Anarchist Critique of Stirner &amp; Egoism"}

When we learned about this, we began investigating instances of these suspicious domains on Reddit. We also conferred with third parties to learn more about the operation, potential technical markers, and other relevant information. While this investigation is still ongoing, we would like to share our current findings.\n\n* To date, we have uncovered 143 accounts we believe to be connected to this influence group. The vast majority (126) were created between 2015 and 2018. A handful (17) dated back to 2011.\n* This group focused on steering the narrative around subjects important to Iran, including criticism of US policies in the Middle East and negative sentiment toward Saudi Arabia and Israel. They were also involved in discussions regarding Syria and ISIS.\n* None of these accounts placed any ads on Reddit.\n* More than a third (51 accounts) were banned prior to the start of this investigation as a result of our routine trust and safety practices, supplemented by user reports (thank you for your help!).\n\nMost (around 60%) of the accounts had karma below 1,000, with 36% having zero or negative karma. However, a minority did garner some traction, with 40% having more than 1,000 karma. Specific karma breakdowns of the accounts are as follows:\n\n* 3% (4) had negative karma\n* 33% (47) had 0 karma\n* 24% (35) had 1-999 karma\n* 15% (21) had 1,000-9,999 karma\n* 25% (36) had 10,000+ karma\n\nTo give you more insight into our findings, we have preserved a sampling of accounts from a range of karma levels that demonstrated behavior typical of the others in this group of 143. We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves, and to educate the public about tactics that foreign influence attempts may use.  The example accounts include:\n\n* [u\/emilyward2017](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/emilyward2017)\n* [u\/Homaeefar](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Homaeefar)\n* [u\/alessia\\_80s](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/alessia_80s)\n* [u\/Anzfp](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/Anzfp)\n* [u\/jeremybernard](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/jeremybernard)\n* [u\/suarezanton](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/suarezanton)\n\nUnlike our [last post on foreign interference](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/announcements\/comments\/8bb85p\/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect\/), the behaviors of this group were different.  While the overall influence of these accounts was still low, some of them were able to gain more traction. They typically did this by posting real, reputable news articles that happened to align with Iran\u2019s preferred political narrative -- for example, reports publicizing civilian deaths in Yemen. These articles would often be posted to far-left or far-right political communities whose critical views of US involvement in the Middle East formed an environment that was receptive to the articles.\n\nThrough this investigation, the incredible vigilance of the Reddit community has been brought to light, helping us pinpoint some of the suspicious account behavior. However, the volume of user reports we\u2019ve received has highlighted the opportunity to enhance our defenses by developing a trusted reporter system to better separate useful information from the noise, which is something we are working on.\n\nWe believe this type of interference will increase in frequency, scope, and complexity. We're investing in more advanced detection and mitigation capabilities, and have recently formed a threat detection team that has a very particular set of skills. Skills they have acquired...you know the drill. Our actions against these threats may not always be immediately visible to you, but this is a battle we have been fighting, and will continue to fight for the foreseeable future. And of course, we\u2019ll continue to communicate openly with you about these subjects.","subreddit":"announcements","title":"An update on the FireEye report and Reddit""num_comments":15,"score":135,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Reddit is censoring accounts that post \"reputable news articles\" about civilian deaths in Yemen because a private firm suspected that Iran may be behind posting (factual) news sources on social media"}

{"author":"NotAllAltmer","created_utc":1535898119,"num_comments":12,"score":3,"selftext":"Hello! I have been reading a lot of things on Anarchy recently and I really wonder if I should label myself as one. English is not my first language so bear with me.\n\nI have always been pretty lawful. Although I complain about authority I have always been pretty chill with it and I try not to get on it\u2019s bad side. However I have stood up against people who have  abused their authority, specially teachers because they are the most immediate figure of power I have been around with. \n\nIn general, I try to avoid cycles of domination as much as possible. When I was a teacher I made it so my students were aware that I was as human as them and I had no power over their will and that I just hoped they liked me enough to learn. With my siblings, I make sure everyone feels listened to, even my 4 year old sister, as I feel everyone\u2019s opinions need to be listened to. When I work with other people, I respect the idea of a leader as a guide but I find it really hard to work with people who think of themselves as the \u201cboss\u201d.\n\nConcerning higher matters, I don\u2019t like Politicians, none of them. I believe that having power in that magnitude automatically corrupts people and that, although the people should need someone who represents them, they don\u2019t need to suffer individuals who feel powerful enough as to choose for us and then call it a democracy. In a way, I think all Politicians are the same, it doesn\u2019t matter the side they lean to. In my opinion, the perfect political system is one in which there are representatives of the state but they have no immunity to laws or no control over people\u2019s lives or choices. It truly enrages me that I, a gay man, depend on what unempathetic heterosexual people say so I can have a happy life. Or that women need to ask men for permission to do things that concerns only women. \n\nInterestingly enough I am a Catholic. Actual Catholic. I believe in God and I think Jesus is my savior and I pray to Virgin Mary and the Saints and all those things Catholics do. I have distanced myself from the Catholic Institution as much as I can, because of the horrible unspeakable things they have done. I still try to go to mass every sunday and I still confess to a priest. I just think that God has a will and a plan for us but men and women, even religious men and women, make mistakes or are just awful human beings. \n\nMaybe because of this I believe there should a be a system of law that its pretty much \u201cDon\u2019t be an asshole to other people\u201d.  My ideas are pretty much just \u201cLive and let live and keep in mind that the other person is as human as you are\u201d I know it sounds awfully idealistic but I truly believe that humans naturally strive for social harmony but the constant stress of the demands of the system that we live in corrupts them and makes society unstable. Therefore, I hate fascists, nazis and any other sort of political \u201cbelief\u201d (I would just call it hate) that thinks of themselves as \u201csuperior\u201d and feel like they have the right to abuse people that threaten their position of power.\n\nEconomically speaking, I don\u2019t like Capitalism but I despise Socialism. The reason why I don\u2019t like Socialism relies on the fact that I am Lithuanian and our experiences with that system is worse than bad. I know I have said that people strive for harmony but I don\u2019t think that harmony relies on everyone being the same. I think humans naturally differentiate themselves and there have always been people who have a lot of money and power and people who don\u2019t have those at all. I think that differences will stay here for a much longer while however it is not impossible at all to reduce this extreme separations. I think Capitalism is naturally unfair and continues to separate people by classes while Socialism makes people believe they are lower than the State, the classical Orwell quote \u201cAll animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others\u201d its what Socialism represents for me.\n\nI find myself frequently agreeing with Anarchists tho in that no State is better that the State we have now and that authority is a dangerous thing for society. I disagree with many however in that I wish to respect the Free Markets as long as clear linings are established for the patrons and workers are paid a fair wage, not to mention that I believe work should go hand in hand with the development of the individual and what they want to contribute to society instead of a condition for survival in the modern world.\n\nSome people have described me as a Mutualist. But I am still not sure. Anyone who knows more than me can tell me if it would be correct to call myself an Anarcho-Mutualist?\n\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Am I an Anarchist?

{"author":"CosmicRaccoonCometh","created_utc":1536081791,"num_comments":1,"score":15,"selftext":"*I've always gained a lot of inspiration from this speech by Tecumseh to the Choctaws and Chickasaws, and wanted to share it here. Probably most people here won't relate to the ethnic side of his argument, but if you listen to it as an appeal by someone encouraging people to fight against the spread of the planetary work machine, then I think there are valuable lessons and points of inspiration here for anarchistic minded people -- that we must stop thinking we are safe or hoping that some politician or long awaited Revolution will come and save us, that we must conquer the power it takes to create our freedom*:\n\n\n\n&gt; In view of questions of vast importance, have we met together in solemn council tonight. Nor should we here debate whether we have been wronged and injured, but by what measures we should avenge ourselves; for our merciless oppressors, having long since planned out their proceedings, are not about to make, but have and are still making attacks upon our race who have as yet come to no resolution. Nor are we ignorant by what steps, and by what gradual advances, the whites break in upon our neighbors. Imagining themselves to be still undiscovered, they show themselves the less audacious because you are insensible. The whites are already nearly a match for us all united, and too strong for any one tribe alone to resist; so that unless we support one another with our collective and united forces; unless every tribe unanimously combines to give check to the ambition and avarice of the whites, they will soon conquer us apart and disunited, and we will be driven away from our native country and scattered as autumnal leaves before the wind.\n\n&gt; But have we not courage enough remaining to defend our country and maintain our ancient independence? Will we calmly suffer the white intruders and tyrants to enslave us? Shall it be said of our race that we knew not how to extricate ourselves from the three most dreadful calamities \u2014 folly, inactivity and cowardice? But what need is there to speak of the past? It speaks for itself and asks, Where today is the Pequod? Where the Narragansetts, the Mohawks, Pocanokets, and many other once powerful tribes of our race? They have vanished before the avarice and oppression of the white men, as snow before a summer sun. In the vain hope of alone defending their ancient possessions, they have fallen in the wars with the white men. Look abroad over their once beautiful country, and what see you now? Naught but the ravages of the paleface destroyers meet our eyes. So it will be with you Choctaws and Chickasaws! Soon your mighty forest trees, under the shade of whose wide spreading branches you have played in infancy, sported in boyhood, and now rest your wearied limbs after the fatigue of the chase, will be cut down to fence in the land which the white intruders dare to call their own. Soon their broad roads will pass over the grave of your fathers, and the place of their rest will be blotted out forever. The annihilation of our race is at hand unless we unite in one common cause against the common foe. Think not, brave Choctaws and Chickasaws, that you can remain passive and indifferent to the common danger, and thus escape the common fate. Your people, too, will soon be as falling leaves and scattering clouds before their blighting breath. You, too, will be driven away from your native land and ancient domains as leaves are driven before the wintry storms.\n\n&gt; Sleep not longer, O Choctaws and Chickasaws, in false security and delusive hopes. Our broad domains are fast escaping from our grasp. Every year our white intruders become more greedy, exacting, oppressive and overbearing. Every year contentions spring up between them and our people and when blood is shed we have to make atonement whether right or wrong, at the cost of the lives of our greatest chiefs, and the yielding up of large tracts of our lands. Before the palefaces came among us, we enjoyed the happiness of unbounded freedom, and were acquainted with neither riches, wants nor oppression. How is it now? Wants and oppression are our lot; for are we not controlled in everything, and dare we move without asking, by your leave? Are we not being stripped day by day of the little that remains of our ancient liberty? Do they not even kick and strike us as they do their blackfaces? How long will it be before they will tie us to a post and whip us, and make us work for them in their cornfields as they do them? Shall we wait for that moment or shall we die fighting before submitting to such ignominy?\n\n&gt; Have we not for years had before our eyes a sample of their designs, and are they not sufficient harbingers of their future determinations? Will we not soon be driven from our respective countries and the graves of our ancestors? Will not the bones of our dead be plowed up, and their graves be turned into fields? Shall we calmly wait until they become so numerous that we will no longer be able to resist oppression? Will we wait to be destroyed in our turn, without making an effort worthy of our race? Shall we give up our homes, our country, bequeathed to us by the Great Spirit, the graves of our dead, and everything that is dear and sacred to us, without a struggle? I know you will cry with me: Never! Never! Then let us by unity of action destroy them all, which we now can do, or drive them back whence they came. War or extermination is now our only choice. Which do you choose? I know your answer. Therefore, I now call on you, brave Choctaws and Chickasaws, to assist in the just cause of liberating our race from the grasp of our faithless invaders and heartless oppressors. The white usurpation in our common country must be stopped, or we, its rightful owners, be forever destroyed and wiped out as a race of people. I am now at the head of many warriors backed by the strong arm of English soldiers. Choctaws and Chickasaws, you have too long borne with grievous usurpation inflicted by the arrogant Americans. Be no longer their dupes. If there be one here tonight who believes that his rights will not sooner or later be taken from him by the avaricious American pale-faces, his ignorance ought to excite pity, for he knows little of the character of our common foe.\n\n&gt; And if there be one among you mad enough to undervalue the growing power of the white race among us, let him tremble in considering the fearful woes he will bring down upon our entire race, if by his criminal indifference he assists the designs of our common enemy against our common country. Then listen to the voice of duty, of honor, of nature and of your endangered country. Let us form one body, one heart, and defend to the last warrior our country, our homes, our liberty, and the graves of our fathers.\n\n&gt; Choctaws and Chickasaws, you are among the few of our race who sit indolently at ease. You have indeed enjoyed the reputation of being brave, but will you be indebted for it more from report than fact? Will you let the whites encroach upon your domains even to your very door before you will assert your rights in resistance? Let no one in this council imagine that I speak more from malice against the paleface Americans than just grounds of complaint. Complaint is just toward friends who have failed in their duty; accusation is against enemies guilty of injustice. And surely, if any people ever had, we have good and just reasons to believe we have ample grounds to accuse the Americans of injustice; especially when such great acts of injustice have been committed by them upon our race, of which they seem to have no manner of regard, or even to reflect. They are a people fond of innovations, quick to contrive and quick to put their schemes into effectual execution no matter how great the wrong and injury to us; while we are content to preserve what we already have. Their designs are to enlarge their possessions by taking yours in turn; and will you, can you longer dally, O Choctaws and Chickasaws?\n\n&gt; Do you imagine that that people will not continue longest in the enjoyment of peace who timely prepare to vindicate themselves, and manifest a determined resolution to do themselves right whenever they are wronged? Far otherwise. Then haste to the relief of our common cause, as by consanguinity of blood you are bound; lest the day be not far distant when you will be left single-handed and alone to the cruel mercy of our most inveterate foe.\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"\"Sleep not longer in false security and delusive hopes\" -- Tecumseh to the Choctaws and Chickasaws"}

Recently, we have focused our efforts on \"survival programs\" because we believe, while important, protest is not enough.

A problem we run into every time we go out there is transportation. As anyone who has lived in New York can attest, transporting a dozen or so hot trays of food on the 6 train at rush hour is not ideal. Thus our first goal is to acquire a vehicle. we are trying to raise 3 grand for a minivan that we can use to transport cooked food, as well as take to pick up crates of fresh produce.you can donate to that fund here:[https:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/the-shut-it-down-kitchen-gets-a-van](https:\/\/www.gofundme.com\/the-shut-it-down-kitchen-gets-a-van)\n\nWe also have a general Fund going for all the other expenses that go along with maintaining weekly protests and monthly food serves, as well as numerous other projects throughout the year.

We were all born and raised in Mexico and we tend to visit a lot of family and friends on an almost daily matter. We live in San Diego and in order to avoid hours of waiting at the border, we applied for and received [Sentry cards](https:\/\/www.cbp.gov\/travel\/trusted-traveler-programs\/sentri\/how-apply-sentri).

My father was driving, my mother in the passenger seat, and my pregnant sister-in-law and my niece were in the back of the car. According to the accounts of my family, there were two border patrol officers on the passenger side checking sentry cards before the actual booth. One of the officers made a hand signal in the shape of a license, implying that my dad flash the sentry cards, which he did - but the officer did not see it. The officer starts walking in front of the vehicle towards the driver side door while making the same motion and yelling something out which my father does not make out (he is deaf). He starts banging on the drivers side door. My father once again flashes the sentry cards and says \"Here it is!\". \n\nMy family says that the officer did not like the tone my father was using and said \"OK. I'm gonna get your sentry card taken away\". My father opens the car door, confused and interpreting the banging on it as the officer asking to open it up. The officer then proceeds to choke my dad, drag him out of the car and handcuff him. My mother tried to explain that my father was deaf and wasn't understanding what the officer wanted. He replied with \"I don't care\".\n\nAfterwards, my father was taken to a processing facility and released without any charges - except the officer was successful in taking his sentry card.\n\nFor obvious reasons this angers me - it really complicates our way of life here in a border city. I'd like to recover my dads sentry card.\n\nI also would like to acquire video of the situation if possible. Border crossings are high-security environments and I know there must be video of the incident in possession by the BP officers. How would I go about getting video of the incident?","subreddit":"legaladvice","title":"My immigrant, deaf father was choked, body-slammed, arrested and had his sentry card taken away at the border for failing to comply to an audible demand.

I didn't participated, I don't care, but I just read their crap to sort of laugh at the childish nonsense they write there, and it was funny at first but now it's getting more and more disturbing.\n\nAt first it was made up of \"libertarians\" with ancap\/libertarian flairs, I mean right-libertarians whatever that means. So they mostly talked about drug legalization, cryptocurrency, glorifying capitalism, a little bit of economics and the most extreme side was a flavor of Randian anti-feminism and mysoginy. This was like in 2011-2013 or so.\n\nThen a sort of pattern of racism started appearing, they were still ancaps with ancap flairs, but more like subtle racism trying to justify why blacks are poor, you know blame it on them, etc etc.. but then simultaneously quoting Thomas Sowell to appear as if they are not racists, they just try to view black poverty from a free market perspective.\n\nThen there was a wave of anti-semitism there with conspiracy theories and shit like that, which stopped quickly, probably some people got banned, and initially even the community was against it. I think this was when a lot of neo-nazi websites got banned so they all flocked there. Regardless at first, they were against it. They said that \"capitalism is freedom and we totally reject nazism\", or so did they pretend at least.\n\n\nThen gradually more and more capitalists came out of the closet and openly admitted that they were for helicopter rides and started fetishizing Pinochet and if people trespass on their property they want them helicoptered. \n\nThen gradually more and more capitalists came out as mysoginists against feminists, and this was the time when the posts about economics started to decline and they started to focus more about social issues. So there were daily mysoginistic posts blaming feminists for all evils of the world and  how dare they hurt their little patriarchal butts.\n\nThen I saw more and more right-wing propaganda being linked there, from conspiracy theories, to anti-immigrant sentiments, calling everyone \"cucks\", and daily shitposts and memes about Marx.\n\nAnd by now they have really shown their true face, about half of the posters there are now open fascists and neo-nazis, who are constantly posting white supremacist neo-nazi garbage there mixed with anti-immigrant, xenophobit, racist and sometimes even anti-semite propaganda.\n\nAlmost none of the posts now are about economics and all of them are basically hateful propaganda.\n\n\nSo there you have it comrades, the natural progression from capitalism towards fascism. I have seen it with my own eyes over the years, and the so called \"NAP\" ancaps who hated \"collectivism\" have all turned into white supremacist fascist neo-nazis.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"From capitalist to fascist..."}

{"author":"libertarian-july-19","created_utc":1536341190,"num_comments":1,"score":10,"selftext":"I would like to share with you my journey into anarchism if anyone cares about it. I think it has to come naturally, like how it came to me, it was a natural progression of contradictions in my head that after it piled up I realized that the whole world is wrong. I just could not live with all the BS in my head so I had shifted radically in my worldview, but it was a natural buildup towards that.\n\n\nI spend most of my early childhood in a rural area. A quasi-religious, traditional rural area, where I was directly connected to nature. Most people were nice and sharing, mostly elderly women, while old guys were mostly grumpy, alcoholic and aggressive. I have experienced true freedom in nature, I loved to play in the fields, we went to play near the river, we were mostly free kids. Guys and girls alike we played together, though I was shy a bit to the girls, we still had a lot of fun as kids. My grandparents also took me fishing, and I immediately had this thought in my head, why do we have to kill that innocent fish just for food? One minor contradiction in my head, but I ignored it.\n\nThe rural area was naturally segregated by wealth, so there were tons of poor families living there. Most of our gang were privileged kids, and we were very racist towards the poor kids. I don't know why? I normally wanted to befriend them, but our parents and granparents told us to stay away from them because they are \"poor\", and probably their parents did the same. We were like 5 year olds, we had no concept of division yet, but already our parents tried to separate us. So unfortunately we were very racists towards them and we even end up in minor fights. I was so ashamed of it, and I didn't know why it happened, but it did. \n\nThen I have also experienced a lot of care from elderly females, neighbors, who made us cookies and gave us free fruits, we were just kids and we shared stuff. But then my grandma took me to the local grocery, where I first experienced money. So it was a very big issue in my head, how come the old lady is kindly gifting us food, while at the grocery store they charge money? I could not understand why did that happen. I did not understand why adults behave the way they do. As a small kid it was a very alienating experience, because I experienced mostly kindness, and then I see that grumpy old guy at the grocery store, who was selfish, and hated kids, and just sold chocolate for money. That was a very shocking experience for me.\n\nMost males in the area were very grumpy, agressive, alcoholic, and domestic violence was pretty high, the cops had to come almost weekly because some guy always beat up his wife. So I have already experienced a dichotomy between the free and kind world and the aggressive brutal world.\n\nI have spend my time playing with the dogs, even though my father warned me not to play with them because they \"bite\", that was nonsense, they never bite me, they were just friendly beings that I had a lot of fun with. I have also played with the chickens and they were very friendly too, and I have cried when my grandmother killed one of the chicken and made food out of it. I was disgusted by it and could not eat it. So I was hysterical about it and weeped very hard, so my father spanked me and told me to shut up and eat.  I didn't understand why my friend had to be turned into food, I didn't eat that meal.\n\nThen I went to school, where I also got along with the schoolmates fine, there was some bullying unfortunately, and I have seen some masculine dominance already amongst the kids, they were probably influenced by the same negative parenting aspects like me, but I didn't endulge in dominance. However the teachers were very dominant. \n\nMost of my teachers were nationalists, patriots, with an urge towards discipline and obedience towards authority. That was totally alien to me, like where did these people came from? Here I am as a kid that experienced freedom, and there are these people that are the total opposite of that. So I naturally hated school, perhaps even more than other kids did. In highschool the patriarchy just reached a whole new level, with scumbag male teachers who abused their authority wherever they could, and it felt almost like a fucking bootcamp.\n\nSo at this point I had a really big hatred for authority, but I didn't know what to believe. I started dating in late highschool, and naturally I didn't had a lot of success, because due to my exposure to patriarchy, I viewed girls as objects, commodities and things that belong to me. My father raised me like that so I didn't know what else to do.\n\nI saw that girls were mostly kind and loved playful and kind boys, while I was angry at authority and I tried to somehow blame my anger on them.\nSo I had an era of mysoginy, but then I met a girl who was more open to me and tolerated my mysogony, and we talked a lot about girly things, and I have experienced kindness like I never did before because my family was a mess, so I have seen my own behavior to be toxic. We dated a lot and it was a lot of fun relationship, and I realized that all problems were in my mind. So I gradually became more and more opened up socially, becase I remembered the freedom that I experienced as a kid, and the authoritarian indoctrination that I experienced in school just washed  away.\n\nSo my early adulthood I became very open and tolerant, so I became a liberal. I didn't care much about politics, but I have seen the world as it is, so I thoght I was a liberal. \n\nI liked the new gadgets, phones, computers, and even though I recognized some issues in the world, I still thought that it was a decent place.\n\nI didn't liked big business, I never liked them though. This was around the financial crisis, I have seen how corrupt and scumbags are these rich people. Partly because later after we moved into the city, my family was poor and I have seen rich guys with sportscars everywhere while my father was always stressed about the bills. So I had a natural hatred for the elite burgeoise.\n\nSo after the banking crisis, which affected my country too, rent prices got fucked up a lot of the colleagues of my father became unemployed, etc.. I have seen how pieces of shit the burgeoise is.\n\nBut I was a liberal, I thought that maybe small businesses are cool. Fuck me but every fucking liberal falls into this trap. So I knew that big business is corrupt, but I thought that just the size is what corrupts them, I thought that small businesses care more about workers.\n\nSo I was an adult and started looking for a job (I didn't went into college, I had so much hatred for school that I could not bear myself another few years into fucking servidude). I find my first job at a grocery store, you know a cool small business; well the owner again was a grumpy middle aged guy, who tried to patronize me and behaved like a patriarch. We has kind of respectable, we went out drinking beer and we had a good relation, but he always demanded maximum discipline and work from me. He kind of allowed me to go on a few vacation days but he demanded more and more work from me.\n\nThere were 4 clerks there in that store, one of us was a female, she was a shy female, and she was very servile to males, she didn't had a consciousness of her own she was totally obedient to the boss, I think she was from a religious household where she was indoctrinated into obedience. So this scumbag boss started yelling at her and bullying here more and more, seeing that she was vulnerable, the boss always made fun of her. So I got into a few arguments with the boss a few times, and that is when hell came down on me. As soon as I stood up to protect that girl, my relationship with that guy went sour, he started picking on me, made me work even more, gave me no paid vacation (even though the law demanded it), and started exploiting me more and more. \n\nI resigned and went to work in another store, same deal, this was a big store, so we had a grumpy middle-manager guy who was also working us to death like he had a whip in his hand and made us work more and more. I resigned from there too, and so on... I worked at several places, I experienced the same shit.\n\nSo my liberalism started to fade away, and I gruadually started to realize that there is no distinction between the scumbag behavior in a small business than that of a big business, it's not the size that makes them scum, it's their position of authority. I started looking online for answers, and I realized the income inequality in the world, the poverty, the suffering, the famine, I looked up all my bosses in the public database for companies and found out that they were all millionaires. Fucking millionaire small business guys from just operating a small business, and they always whipped us into working more and more and barely paid us. \n\nA fucking boss of mine even said one week that \"we should work harder because the business is low on money\". The fucking piece of shit lied, he was a millionaire. Just fucking made us feel sympathetic towards him, so he manipulated us into working even harder while he was already filthy rich.\n\nAt that point I totally became disillusioned from capitalism. The poverty, discrimination, and authority that I have experienced throughout all my life made me realize the class war that is going on. \n\nI have seen how these rich scumbags exploit the workers, how they flaunt with their new sportscar, how they lie about being short on money so you work even harder for them, and how capitalism systematically destroys everything nice in the world.\n\nFrom the fucking fake TV ads that constantly make you buy shit, to the asshole male boss in the store that is a greedy piece of shit that is abusing it's workers.\n\nI have also seen how the government never does anything to protect the vulnerable people (nowadays they start to, but not enough), and it's always there to protect the wealthy. \n\nSo yeah, long story, but this is how I have became an anarchist and a communist. I read up on Bakunin and Kropotkin and I instantly loved it, I can't believe I supported this mad system, and people who didn't experience what I did are even in worse shape, they are even more brainwashed.\n\nSo take my example for what it's worth, and hopefully you can help other confused people escape the clutches of systemic dominance as well.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"My life journey into Anarchism"}

What I write I find is the truth and could be important.\n* This is not me strawmanning Marx' labor theory, I am just making one simple addition to it.\n* I haven't actually read The Capital through, shame on me, but please hear me out and maybe some of you reading this have actually read the damn thing through and could tell me if he later elaborates on his definition of work or if any inconsistencies could emerge.\n\nWhen he talks about labor, he treats it as an abstract concept, as in I go to work and I do something there and if I do it right I even create a use value. Now what is this \"something\" I do when I work? The solution is trivial, it's work)! A force acting through a distance, a measure of conversion of energy. This hypothesis is consistent with everything Marx wrote so far, which makes sense as he simply accepted the truth that \"work\" as an abstract concept exists and extrapolated from that point.\n\nThis brings along a few implications, take these with a grain of salt as they are merely a product of my mind:\n\n* Money is actually a measure of the conversion of energy, i.e. work, so there exists a conversion factor c such, that $1 = c J with 1 \\[J\\] = 1 \\[Joule\\].\n* There is no way to distinguish work that makes our world a better place - work that creates use value - from work that actually brings us closer to chaos when you look at the work through the lens of capital, i.e. if you use money as a measure. Any attempt to make this distinction with the help of monetary compensation is futile, the contradictions which root in this attempt are visible today; Panhandlers work the hardest job in our society and get compensated the least, now look at Jeffrey Pigshit Bezos. This observation necessitates a universal basic income, even for ants!\n* Money does have its value (hah) though, as it evaluates work that has been done in the past - it acts as a manifestation of exchange value. What we lack is a means to estimate work that needs to be done in the future though. A means to say \"fekk you\" to everyone driving 2 tonne diesel cars alone, to everyone polluting our oceans or benefiting off of slave labor.\n* Now this is my own conclusion, or solution, so take that with an even bigger grain of salt: not-money. It sounds absurd, but if you play with the idea of taking money and mirroring it - money is something you \"have\" so you can spend only what you own but are receive an infinite amount (if we ignore all economical consequences) - to make a not-money that you can spend an infinite amount of, but receive repercussions if you receive too much of it, at least in my head it becomes all sensible. Enforce the value of this not-money by the social contract (or a bank, whatever), just as we do now with money where we attach value to a worthless printed on piece of paper or bytes in some database, and you got a system that could actually guide our workforce to what needs to be cleaned up. Now historically it is obvious that something like this wouldn't exist, why would we even need a second money? But after decades of exponential growth, our past is slowly catching up with us and if we don't start making plans for our future our civilization is doomed to die.\n* So my solution to capitalism: To bring balance to the force and to find a way to channel your feelings not only in a positive feedback-loop of giving money, but also to express your discontent, to be able to write Bezos a check over a million because he's literally evil.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"My very own labor theory"}

This trend is not new to american liberals who happen to be (ugh) triggered by very small and insignificant things. This might be a trait of liberal feminism but I have also noticed this in some ML's as well as anarchists, although in less amount. And its not good. As an anarchist, I don't believe in restricting peoples speech, although I do not support using racial or any other slurs and I see no situation in which one would use them. I don't support \"shhh don't say that\"-\" you can't say that\"-\"you misgendered me\" attitude, at least not in anarchist circles, as its clear breach of muh freedom of speech, I also am not very fond of concentrating on miniature issues women\/lgbt in most part of western society face instead of focusing on actually important issues such as women and lgbt issues in middle east and Africa. One last thing about \"offensive words\": words are only offensive if we percievd them as such. \n\nOn islam: Far right wingers are wrong about many many assumptions they make about them but we can't pretend like there are no issues caused by them. But instead of hating immigrants or just letting them run amok we should focus on cause of their problems. Is islamophobia a thing? Yes, but is every critique of islam islamophobia? Of course not. We should attack all religions equally, because islam is currently more dangerous than Christianity (in belief that is, and possibly even in practice).\n\nAll this being said, we should not lose time on small things and we should focus more on things that matter.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"muh free speech"}

Sure, the Soviet Union was the closest a powerful nation has ever come to being a socialist state... but it failed. The workers didn't own the means of production. The government did. It's so easy for capitalists to point at the USSR and use that as an example of why socialism doesn't work, and it's so easy to refute that argument: they failed in achieving socialism the moment Lenin decided not to give up the power invested in the state. Everything that happened after, the good, bad, and ugly, cannot be attributed to socialism, because it wasn't. It's that simple.\n\nThe obvious amounts of tyranny and oppression that happened under the soviet government should not be used as an example of what socialism is supposed to be, nor should it be a blueprint for revolutions to come. It's time for socialists to move away from the idea of authoritarianism to \"eventually achieve socialism\" because that's not going to work.\n\nIf we could sever the connection between the communal, worker- based decentralized society socialism was meant to be and the oppressive \"communist\" regimes in Russia, china and Eastern Europe in the 20th century, not only would it make it easier for people to get started in socialist groups and ideas, it would make those opposed to socialism unable to make the same baseless arguments against it.\n\nThe biggest roadblock to socialism in 2018 is misconceptions about what it is.

Since putting humans to supervise the huge amounts of pictures, sound, videos and text that gets uploaded everywhere is impossible, such supervision would be done mostly by automated computer programs. This law has massive harmful ramifications worldwide, similar to the old SOPA law.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere are better alternatives to this law, such as (this), so there's no reason at all for this law to pass.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd here's why it shouldn't:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1: Destruction of Innovation: \n\nOriginal creators will get censored by the massive amounts of false-positives. This prevents their propagation and also harms completely legal fan works under fair-use.\n\nAbout the false-positives: [https:\/\/www.techdirt.com\/articles\/20180708\/01252940196\/numerical-exploration-how-eus-article-13-will-lead-to-massive-censorship.shtml](https:\/\/www.techdirt.com\/articles\/20180708\/01252940196\/numerical-exploration-how-eus-article-13-will-lead-to-massive-censorship.shtml)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2: Oppression and Abuse of Power:\n\nMost if not all internet traffic will be monitored, putting a de-facto end to all privacy, destroying activism and preventing the world from becoming a better place. You can never report issues anonimously.\n\nThe filters also can definitely be tampered with, with or without new legislation or the population's knowledge, to exclude any content that is inconvenient to corrupt authorities. It can also prevent the propagation of ideas that harm the status quo, thus creating an overly obedient population that accepts oppression and misery.\n\nPutting it all together, any causes of suffering like world hunger, mass unemployment, disease and crime can be easily be swept under the rug, unseen and unsolved.\n\nRemember that this law exists solely because of the corporate lobbying that corrupts and destroys democracy. This is just the beginning.\n\nAbout the EU lobbying: [https:\/\/corporateeurope.org\/lobbyplanet](https:\/\/corporateeurope.org\/lobbyplanet)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3: Smashing of the Lower Classes:\n\nSuch a system would be difficult and expensive to set up, harming small internet business as a whole and giving an undue advantage to bigger corporations. This is greatly augmented for creatives due to the false-positives.\n\nSmall business is the true soul of the economy, it is where economic competition comes from. An economy where big corporations rule the market without the competition of the small ones leads to poor products, poor wages, unemployment and hunger.\n\nAbout the importance of small business: [https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/entry\/why-are-small-businesses-so-important-for-the-economy\\_us\\_58f61f9ae4b048372700db75](https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/entry\/why-are-small-businesses-so-important-for-the-economy_us_58f61f9ae4b048372700db75)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot in Europe? It Still Affects You: \n\nWhile many businesses will initially block Europe to avoid the filter, they will eventually try to permeate the european market. Since adapting your current product is easier than creating another one, many companies will censor their own content to make it pass the filter.\n\nThat means you, outside of Europe, will receive content filtered by Europe's authoritarianism. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat You Can Do:\n\nRaise noise.

Im working In Johannesburg, South Africa.\n\nContext: There is the beginnings of a large growing squatter movement; young students and artists, who are in need of working and living space. The situation in the land is that there is a massive amount of young people without any  resources and wealth, the historical exclusion and slavery of black people for 300 years in Southern Africa by the invading colonial settlers has devastated the futures of black people, and has meant massive rifts within race and inequality - In the now. This history shapes the contemporary. But many young activists, artist and students aware of this history are looking for other possibles ways of living, that do not need the requirement or aid of the state. (a state who is still colonial and capitalist),\n\nThe idea to make ones own, building a community, and autonomous systems of living in the city has now become a necessity for living and surviving the state does very little in this regard. Young people are forced to live outside of the states bounds. Which has meant the creation of the alternatives, out of necessity. This has become particularly apparent in cities across South Africa, but also unoccupied land in rural areas of South Africa is also being occupied and utilized by previously impoverished black farm laborers. With the absence of government, or any state supervision, they are creating and finding alternative means of living without state infrastructure.\n\nMany of these occupations have become political in their nature because of their disbelief in, and hatred toward the government and state in general. all of whom are interested in building communities. This is occurring in Johannesburg,  With new laws coming in on the distribution of property, artists and performers are making use of abandoned property and houses as the laws are potentially shifting in their favor.\n\nThese state negaterrrs and occupiers need help. they need equipment: for cooking, for painting, for building, for communicating (airtime), and money to purchase food, (in times where the vegetable gardens cannot carry them through the winter. )\n\nThey were thinking that they could find aid and assistance from the community of anarchists in the global north. The Right is linking up all across the world. so shouldn't we also exchange support?\n\nDoes anyone know of crowd funding platforms that might be useful ?","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Squatting movement in Johannesburg South Africa, Advice on sustaining the movement."}

We are going to keep our resistance up tomorrow, with the same persistence.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBIG UPDATE 2 There is an inconsistency with the latest news and the Construction Workers Union's report. The workers have just stated that they are going to go on with the strike tomorrow, and until the terms are accepted. This clearly shows that the management did not comply. Workers refuse to work tomorrow as well. There are now 22 terms proposed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBIG UPDATE! Management *is expected* *to* accept 15 terms proposed by the workers. They include:\n\n* Demonstrators won't be fired\n* Those dismissed without warning will return to work\n* Issues with shuttle services will be dealt with\n* Cleaning on a regular basis will be provided for dorms and toilets\n* Infestations will be dealt with\n* Medical services and equipment will be provided for the workers\n* Late payments will be compensated\n* Workplace casualties will be investigated\n* Executives responsible for workers' problems will be dismissed\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nManagement representatives entered the area to talk workers out of this occupation.

Truly a sight to see.\n\nOne of the workers says that injury and death were so frequent that ambulances picked up casualties without turning on sirens, avoiding to alert other workers on the site. (WTF)\n\nIt appears that what triggered the strike was a shuttle accident that happened just yesterday. 4 dead and 17 injured.\n\n\\---\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Here](http:\/\/www.diken.com.tr\/yeni-havalimani-insaatinda-binlerce-isci-eylem-baslatti-jandarma-mudahalesi\/) is a useful Turkish source.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe \"third airport\" in Istanbul, so it is called due to it not being named yet, has been Erdo\u011fan's big project and as a promise it had gotten him serious support, especially during the last few elections.

Workers responded by cutting the cord to the speakers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe workers have blocked the exit route of the shuttles at the construction site this morning with the aim of speaking out against the horrible working conditions. Here are some claims from the workers:\n\n\"About two workers die everyday. Everyday there are injuries\" This particular worker said that one of their friends is currently being treated in the hospital, but they can't get any information on them, all they are told is that they are in intensive care and nothing more.\n\n\"They make us stand under the rain. Our rooms are infested with bed bugs and fleas\"\n\n\"Half of the workers have gone to work this morning, half of them are here. The bosses won't answer to us, they say 'It'll be dealt with in a weak' and evade us\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[A better view](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MIuO-Dgr11o) of the crowd and [tear gas attacks](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nRpNXAhProM).

{"author":"vendetti","created_utc":1537033736,"num_comments":3,"score":0,"selftext":"0I think we can all agree that one of the biggest barriers to real discussion of Anarchist thought is the meaning of the words \"Private Property\". Most people have never heard the phrase \"personal property\" and commonly use \"Private Property\" in its place. \n\nNo amount of \"but that's not what private property means\" will sway most listeners on the subject. I can see why... when you enter a debate\/discussion with someone and one of the first things they tell you is that you don't understand a word you *know that you know*, it can be very off-putting. It would be easy to then assume that either a) this person has no idea what they are talking about or b) they use alternative definitions of words to fit their narrative.\n\nI don't think that its a good tactic to expect people to ignore everything they have been taught about how the world works while you attempt to sway them to Anarchist and Socialist thought. It seems to me that a better tactic would be to engage thought in a way that doesn't bombard them with the words that don't have association with the authoritarian \"communism\" (and socialism by extension, because socialism is frequently called communist in anti-socialist propaganda) that they have been taught. \n\nIf we are to truly engage with our peers in attempt to present socialism as a progression from capitalism, we have to also make clear that we aren't the Authoritarian Communists that they know. My suggestion then is this: use words that have a set, Capitalist definition in the world of Neo-Liberalism. Instead of Private Property, use Capital Goods. \n\nMost people aren't going to have a set, internalized definition of Capital Goods. You then get a chance to briefly explain its meaning and when they look it up later they will find no mention of Marx, Communism, or Anarchism on the Wikipedia page. (or the investopedia page that pops up first and actually has a nice, succinct definition shown on google search results without having to open the page)\n\nFrom there, when having a discussion on the matter you have built yourself some credibility and can move on forward to neutral terms like using \"factors of production\" instead of \"means of production\", etc. When one searches the phrase \"factors of production\", one finds a Wikipedia page with both an explanation of the subject in \"Classical Economies\" (though I don't much like that title) *and* Marxism. \n\nThere are lots of other examples, such as *STOP CALLING CAPITALISTS BOURGEOISIE AND JUST CALL THEM CAPITALISTS*. You don't do anything but turn people off using words and definitions that have no purpose in modern society  and those people *will* assume you are just some lazy communist that doesn't understand how economics work. When all the words and phrases you use point to Marxism, people *will assume* that you haven't done any other research in economics. \n\nI'm not saying you need to pretend to support Capitalism or market economy at all but for fucks sake level with people for just a  moment and show your understanding of economics. People don't trust Socialism because we always point to words and phrases with meanings that have been skewed or sound pompous (seriously, stop calling people bourgeoisie). Speak with people in a way they are comfortable with and they will actually listen to you.\n\nAlso, we should probably stop trying to use our (better) definition of violence in normal discussion with others because they just think we are broadening the definition of words to play victim.

Humanity now has the means, the resources, and the collective will, for all human beings on this planet to live in material security. No one, no longer need struggle to survive.\n\nThrough our technological and social development, we are now able to ensure that every human being has the food, water, shelter, clothing, medicine, safety, and education, not just to survive, but to thrive too. This truly remarkable accomplishment need now only be realised and made manifest. It is to this end that the \u2018Enough\u2019 movement is designed and dedicated.\n\n**A Better World**\n\nTo do so would not just end immense suffering for billions of human beings, but would unleash vast human potential that would transform our world and benefit all human beings, from the rich to the poor, as major progress is made in the arts, sciences, and philosophy.\n\n**Our Duty**\n\nIt is self-evident that, if all human beings can have material security then all human being should, and that, if any human being can help another to have material security then they should help\u2026 as a priority, to the best of their ability, without being compelled to compromise their own material security.\n\n**World Situation**\n\nOur situation is severe and urgent. Twenty two thousand children die every day because of poverty whilst one third of all food produced is wasted. Billions of dollars continue to be spent on unnecessary, avoidable wars that devastate countless lives and communities. Twenty one trillion dollars is held in offshore accounts whilst half of the world\u2019s population live on less than three dollars per day. In addition, worst of all, we exploit and destroy the very environment that we all need just to exist.\n\nThis is not just crazy and immoral, but something so much more \u2013 a wretched illness at the heart of our species that does not reflect our true nature or intelligence, and that requires a radical transformation, not just of our societies, but also of ourselves. The Enough movement is designed and dedicated towards taking the strongest, most decisive peaceful action necessary to end this madness, and help create a world that reflects the wishes and needs of us all.\n\n**Our Objectives**\n\nOur initial objectives are:\n\n\u2022 Make the realisation that we no longer need struggle to survive into the dominant, defining narrative of our times  \n \u2022 Develop the activist community into an effective force for change  \n \u2022 Redistribute food waste to those in need  \n \u2022 Encourage and inspire ideas on how to achieve material security for all human beings\n\n**Our Strategy**\n\nOur strategy is simple\u2026 unity and compromise. We will talk to and work with all human beings with the simple aim of creating mutual understanding, finding a common ground, and developing a middle way forwards that benefits all. We will pose no threat.\n\n**Achieving This**\n\nEnding the struggle for survival will not be a simple or easy task, but it will be achieved. It is estimated that it will cost around fifty billion dollars a year for three years to end poverty. That is less than one percent of the twenty one trillion dollars being held in offshore accounts. This is not a pipe dream. This is possible. Not only is it possible, not only is it so clearly the right thing to do, but it is also the deepest, most primal, most universal desire of all human beings, and one that transcends all our petty differences. In this, we are united.\n\n**How You Can Help**\n\n\u2022 Share this vision  \n \u2022 Think about how the struggle for survival has harmed humanity, from crime to greed, from poverty to war  \n \u2022 Think about how material security would benefit humanity, from less suffering to unleased human potential  \n \u2022 Think about what \u2018material security\u2019 includes and how we can achieve it, from social projects to technological innovation, from political campaigns to philosophical development  \n \u2022 Think about how you can develop yourself to become an effective force for good in the world, from personal development to personal sacrifices, from further education to meeting new people\n\nWe are looking to build a team. If you have experience and knowledge about building an effective movement then we would be interested in hearing from you. We are also looking for people with organisational skills, and people with marketing skills, especially in social media. Please send a CV and covering letter to the email below.

Humanity now has the means, the resources, and the collective will, for all human beings on this planet to live in material security. No one, no longer need struggle to survive.\n\nThrough our technological and social development, we are now able to ensure that every human being has the food, water, shelter, clothing, medicine, safety, and education, not just to survive, but to thrive too. This truly remarkable accomplishment need now only be realised and made manifest. It is to this end that the \u2018Enough\u2019 movement is designed and dedicated.\n\n**A Better World**\n\nTo do so would not just end immense suffering for billions of human beings, but would unleash vast human potential that would transform our world and benefit all human beings, from the rich to the poor, as major progress is made in the arts, sciences, and philosophy.\n\n**Our Duty**\n\nIt is self-evident that, if all human beings can have material security then all human being should, and that, if any human being can help another to have material security then they should help\u2026 as a priority, to the best of their ability, without being compelled to compromise their own material security.\n\n**World Situation**\n\nOur situation is severe and urgent. Twenty two thousand children die every day because of poverty whilst one third of all food produced is wasted. Billions of dollars continue to be spent on unnecessary, avoidable wars that devastate countless lives and communities. Twenty one trillion dollars is held in offshore accounts whilst half of the world\u2019s population live on less than three dollars per day. In addition, worst of all, we exploit and destroy the very environment that we all need just to exist.\n\nThis is not just crazy and immoral, but something so much more \u2013 a wretched illness at the heart of our species that does not reflect our true nature or intelligence, and that requires a radical transformation, not just of our societies, but also of ourselves. The Enough movement is designed and dedicated towards taking the strongest, most decisive peaceful action necessary to end this madness, and help create a world that reflects the wishes and needs of us all.\n\n**Our Objectives**\n\nOur initial objectives are:\n\n\u2022 Make the realisation that we no longer need struggle to survive into the dominant, defining narrative of our times  \n \u2022 Develop the activist community into an effective force for change  \n \u2022 Redistribute food waste to those in need  \n \u2022 Encourage and inspire ideas on how to achieve material security for all human beings\n\n**Our Strategy**\n\nOur strategy is simple\u2026 unity and compromise. We will talk to and work with all human beings with the simple aim of creating mutual understanding, finding a common ground, and developing a middle way forwards that benefits all. We will pose no threat.\n\n**Achieving This**\n\nEnding the struggle for survival will not be a simple or easy task, but it will be achieved. It is estimated that it will cost around fifty billion dollars a year for three years to end poverty. That is less than one percent of the twenty one trillion dollars being held in offshore accounts. This is not a pipe dream. This is possible. Not only is it possible, not only is it so clearly the right thing to do, but it is also the deepest, most primal, most universal desire of all human beings, and one that transcends all our petty differences. In this, we are united.\n\n**How You Can Help**\n\n\u2022 Share this vision  \n \u2022 Think about how the struggle for survival has harmed humanity, from crime to greed, from poverty to war  \n \u2022 Think about how material security would benefit humanity, from less suffering to unleased human potential  \n \u2022 Think about what \u2018material security\u2019 includes and how we can achieve it, from social projects to technological innovation, from political campaigns to philosophical development  \n \u2022 Think about how you can develop yourself to become an effective force for good in the world, from personal development to personal sacrifices, from further education to meeting new people\n\nWe are looking to build a team. If you have experience and knowledge about building an effective movement then we would be interested in hearing from you. We are also looking for people with organisational skills, and people with marketing skills, especially in social media. Please send a CV and covering letter to the email below.

As an anarchist you kind of have to make your research to make sure you aren't actually listening (and enjoying...) a fascist band. Typical exemple would be Burzum, since it's probably the most reknown metal band, but there is plenty such as Peste Noire and others.\n\nSome bands it's hard to know exactly if they are just seen as fascist because of people ignorance or because they actually hold fascit views. For example Satanic Warmaster is one of them for me, it's a one-man band so it should be easy but the more I read about him the less I'm sure of his views. He is heavily in satanism and that's basically it for him, but I don't know shit about satanism so this doesn't mean a lot for me.\n\nAnd then you have bands that are openly anti-fascist but I just know two, Gaylord (which is amazing but only have a few songs) and  Neckbeard Deathcamp (which aren't my cup of tea musically).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo guys am I doomed to listen to Gaylord's three songs over and over or do you have some good bands for me?","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Antifascist Black Metal anyone?"}

For centuries it was used to describe people whose lifestyles clashed with prevailing social norms. Later, the term solidified as a slur used against people of heterodox sexual habits. In recent times - in fact, possibly within the living memory of readers of this post, the targets of this harmful term successfully fought back against their oppressors, and repurposed the word for their own ends.\n\nThey fought back against the language used to oppress them, disarmed their assailants, and turned their own weapons against them! The word \"queer\" had been recovered from the maws of hate, and today it has found a new home, embraced and celebrated by the LGBT**Q** community, and by freedom-loving people everywhere.\n\nThe point I am driving at is that we ought not simply abandon words tainted by our enemies. To do so is to admit defeat in their linguistic conquest. To allow them to colonize further and further into our vocabularies and our minds. Far better is to take the fight to them, to deny them ownership of our lexicon, and to struggle against their constant encroachment on our discourse. No taint is so severe as to be irredeemable. A restorative outlook is more worthwhile than a punitive one. \n\nIt'll be hard work, as any worthile endeavor is, but the rewards are well worth the struggle - we gain control of the language!

Also [sub.media](https:\/\/sub.media) (it's an educational website about anarchism although it tends toward white male anarchism sometimes, similar to how Bernie tends towards white male pseudosocialism). Also sidenote, Black people can internalize ideologies propagating systemic racism, women can internalize patriarchy, *and* benefit from it because this incarnation of hidden, presumably absent oppression *requires* the presence of an elite that the system can point to and go \"if they can do it so can you\" while also \"they\" benefit themselves. Poor people can internalize capitalism and neoliberalism, due to their intersectional privileges, such as being a man and\/or being white and the psychological wage associated with it and the belief that the problems are being caused by \"the minorities\" stealing your job, and\/or because the hegemonic ideology that is implemented and benefits the status quo is rarely challenged and far more easily suppressed outside of privileged circles such as extremely expensive private colleges and schools.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: It's not enough to vote. You must organize to sabotage capitalism-imperialism-patriarchy-racism-ableism and all the offshooting systems of oppression that are interlinked and intersect in various ways, if there is any hope for the survival of humanity in any sort of actually humane manner. This sometimes looks like voting for a candidate who will, for instance, prevent the construction of new prisons or oil pipelines, but ultimately looks like seeking to build militant groups providing mutual aid but *also* physically sabotaging the machinery because we actually are close enough to access much of it physically, while those who are most impacted often are not.\n\nFriendly reminder that while voting is important for immediate and essential reform based initiatives to protect the most marginalized in specific communities, and perhaps even nationwide, the political system is set up in a way that does not allow for this to occur. There may be some benefits to the lives of some marginalized people, but more often than not these are limited to those who are most privileged within those communities. For instance, the famous \"gay rights\" victories of this decade are marriage and anti-discrimination (although even the latter is really not guaranteed, re: [https:\/\/www.al.com\/news\/index.ssf\/2018\/06\/supreme\\_court\\_rules\\_in\\_favor\\_o\\_1.html](https:\/\/www.al.com\/news\/index.ssf\/2018\/06\/supreme_court_rules_in_favor_o_1.html)), these \"victories\" are merely legal, which means that they cannot be enforced on the ground, similar to civil rights \"victories\" which require a \"proof of intent to discriminate\" from the plaintiff. This means that as long as an employer provides any reason other than someone being gay for firing them, there's no way to \"prove\" discrimination. Also, you have to get to court in the first place, which means you have to be able to afford a lawyer, or be picked up by organizations like the ACLU which are notorious for practicing respectability politics, i.e. only those who they deem \"respectable\" enough to win the jury over, so that they don't lose the case.\n\nFurther, and in my opinion more importantly, these \"victories\" are most relevant to the most privileged gay people, i.e. middle and upper class, mostly white ppl. In other words, if someone has to worry about keeping a roof over their head and the heads of their kids and partner, they're not gonna go pay for a marriage license \\*except\\* you might say, for the purpose of getting civil recognition if they end up in public housing. Ok, but they're far more likely to end up homeless instead due to cuts to the already very limited aid that the state deigns to provide.\n\nIn other words, find me a politician who isn't beholden to neoliberalism (the idea that everything is a marketplace and a commodity, including food and water, and the people who can't afford them can't afford them because they're not trying hard enough, and therefore don't deserve any help in affording them and can fucking die. Of course this applies so much more when one is Black, or undocumented, or gay, or a \"criminal\\[we can get into how this is essentially a code word for Black\\]\" etc. because not only are you not \"trying hard enough\" you also literally can't because you're never going to get a job especially if you live in what is still a ghetto because of a century of legal and wink and nod redlining), either ideologically, or systematically. Also, find me a voter who isn't beholden to the ideology of the status quo that not only are they responsible for their own situation, but also that since the \"welfare queen\\[codeword for Black single mother\\]\" takes handouts with \"our tax money\" and uses it to buy luxury cars no one should receive welfare. Meanwhile, trillions of dollars are fed into the military imperial project\/industrial complex that are directly and indirectly (as in the case of Israel and Saudi Arabia) used to murder uncountable numbers of *human beings.*\n\nYou may say Bernie, but boy lemme tell you he is not the kind of white man that is a \"good leftist ally.\" If you read his website, it may have a \\*somewhat\\* better analysis of [https:\/\/berniesanders.com\/issues\/racial-justice\/](https:\/\/berniesanders.com\/issues\/racial-justice\/) issues than most other vapid lizards that pretend to care about people (actually this is just me being frustrated, I have no misconceptions about their individual goodness but neither do I thinkt that they actually area individually in a position where they can actually effect any kind of change, since once the ball is rolling on capitalism in my opinion only revolutionary groups like the Black Panther Party and Che Guevara and Fidel Castro's guerrilla army can even \\*hope\\* to stop it, since it has ingrained itself in a way that prevents us from seeing or justifies the most blatant examples of ongoing life destruction and murder being propagated using the capital that we produce, while encouraging us to become more and more dependent due to the small benefits that it deigns to provide to us--which is exactly the case with Bernie. No politician ever can run and be elected and then implement a complete demilitarization and a seizure of private property of land, and other means of production that \"owners\" make a killing from just due to having the title of \"owner\" while the people who live there and work there beg for a raise to be able to feed their kids, and a handover to collective responsibility. Ultimately his demands amount to the state enabling capitalism to continue to survive and exploit while marginally making the lives of *some* humans a little bit better, but on the whole allow the impact of systemic and historical racism on Black communities in America to be completely ignored and papered over through colorblind reforms. Similarly, his take on [https:\/\/berniesanders.com\/issues\/fighting-for-womens-rights\/](https:\/\/berniesanders.com\/issues\/fighting-for-womens-rights\/) issues may be \\*somewhat\\* better than said lizards, but there is no attempt to address the fact that reproductive labor, not just the actual having of children, but the caring for them and raising them, and even earning enough to feed them while also caring for them is often the burden of women alone, in Addition to the fact that women are not only more likely to be paid less for the same jobs, but also that the somewhat well paying jobs that are accessible to people who don't graduate from college are only available to men further fucking over a woman who wants to be a construction worker so that her child can live to see another day.\n\nPlus, let's not forget that the actual reforms that he suggests are exactly that: reforms. And that presumes that the system is in fact \"broken\" and *can* be reformed. Spoiler alert, it's neither. There is a reason why institutions like the supreme court and the government and the laws and the police which is their primary weapon on the ground can't stop reinforcing the power of corporations, and that reason begins with the letters capita and ends with the letters lism. Which btw is a system that's based on this basic fundamental fact: as long as the employee produces more value than they are given as recompensation, their job is secure. Further, if an employee causes trouble, or fails to live up to the standard above, there must be a class of people readily willing to take their place so that the owner can continue to profit from just their \"ownership.\" Which is in essence a claim to a right over the spoils of genocide and life destruction, past and present. Capitalism would never have worked without slavery, which was legal in America for longer than it's been not. And yet we pretend that it's irrelevant, that everyone is on the \"same playing field\" and the fact that the majority of billionaires (and politicians) are cishet Christian white men is either a coincidence or a function of the fact that they are inherently superior. We've replaced rule by god's grace with rule by the godmarket's grace and they are both equally false.","subreddit":"actuallesbians","title":"It's not enough to vote: A response to \"Are you registered to vote?\"""num_comments":2,"score":13,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"I wrote a thing on r\/actuallesbians and I was hoping for some feedback from y'all please?"}

{"author":"Lorrasoana","created_utc":1537639840,"num_comments":3,"score":17,"selftext":"I'm a bit of an \"armchair\" anarchist mostly because of where I live and because of my former professional career.  Now I'm a bit of a petty-bougie with my own small business (I'm a consultant at my own \"one man show,\" part-time student, and full-time dad), but I would gladly trade my business in for real change in our world.  Right now I'm in \"don't hate the player, hate the game\" mode and trying to get enough coin together to send my kids to college one day.  I guess that makes me a bit of a hypocrite - but life is hard always fighting the system and I'm tired.  Even at 30, I still hate the system I live under and yearn for a better world.  If anything, my politics have slowly shifted further and further to the left with every passing year.\n\nI wrote this quick paper for a class I had to take while I was going back to school for my second BS awhile back.  They didn't count my composition class from a decade ago, so I had to take ENG101 or whatever a few semesters ago.\n\nOne of the topics was \"discuss illegal immigration,\" basically my thoughts are \"fuck the whole concept of illegal immigration.\"  So I wrote this:\n\n&gt;The question is pretty simple \u2013 why do we have borders?  Are there any real reasons for borders?  Does our world get better with borders?  Can we live without them?  I think we can.  In this paper, I intend to show you exactly why borders make our world worse, help to isolate people from one another, and otherwise function to keep power firmly planted in the hands of those that already have power.  We can do better than fencing ourselves off from our fellow man.  We can do better than keeping the starving separated from the fed.\n\n&gt;\tI should mention that politically I don\u2019t really fit into the \u201cnormal\u201d left-right dichotomy.  I consider myself an anarchist.  I\u2019m not one of those \u201cbrick-through-a-starbucks-window\u201d types \u2013 rather, I disagree with the way humans have historically organized themselves.  Call me an \u201carmchair anarchist.\u201d  I think we tend to concentrate too much power in the hands of two few people, then are surprised when those people abuse that power.  I think we\u2019d be better off to organize ourselves in an organic way, without the unjustifiable hierarchies inherent to our current society and go from there.  We\u2019d be better off to have a consensus based system that was adaptive and matched the reality.  This isn\u2019t some John Lennon-esque dream either, truly anarchist based systems have been tried successfully in the past \u2013 although they tend to be crushed in short order by the Communists and the Fascists.  My beliefs may not be explicitly relevant to the discussion at hand, but I think it\u2019s only fair to my readers to explain a bit of background about the author \u2013 beyond that, I strongly believe that borders help maintain the social order that oppresses the poor and disenfranchised throughout the world.  I\u2019m not going to purport to say that a world without borders would be easier, or safer, or that the transition to that world wouldn\u2019t be filled with tribulation \u2013 but that world will be worth it and it\u2019s a world we can realize.\n\n&gt;\tSo why are borders terrible?  Firstly, they are imaginary.  Before I got sick and couldn\u2019t fly for a living anymore, I was a pilot.  I routinely crossed a multitude of borders, state borders, county-lines, the borders of Canada, Mexico, and beyond.  I\u2019ve seen across the border to Russia from the Bering Sea, and I\u2019ve personally looked down on Europe from 30,000\u2019.  Unless you\u2019re intimately familiar with the geography, it\u2019s effectively impossible to tell which country you\u2019re flying over without some sort of precise navigational reference.  The lines that show up on a globe don\u2019t really exist, and the straight line that runs along some parallel are as imaginary as Santa Claus.  To speak to the current border controversy in Mexico, from 10,000\u2019 above the ground, Nuevo Laredo and Laredo look identical \u2013 I know, I\u2019ve been there at that altitude (lower and higher actually too) and I know there\u2019s no difference.  Organizing our lives and where we live around a collective delusion seems a bit irrational to me.\n\n&gt;Borders are more than just imaginary, they\u2019re actually regressive \u2013 they support ideas that are based on histories that are steeped in ethnic conflict, class division, and war.  Literally the only reason a border exists between North and South Korea is due to a costly and tragic war.  The much maligned border between the US and Mexico \u2013 also due to war.  Many of the borders in Africa are based on absurd colonialist ambition, ancient tribal rivalry, and linguistic discrimination.  Think of \u201cthe Troubles\u201d in Northern Ireland, or the Catalonian Secessionist movements that go back over a century.  When we draw a border through a people and separate them in two it weakens them, this was an explicit goal of colonization efforts in Africa and exercised to great (and tragic) effect in the Belgian Congo.  In the Middle East \u201ccolonial powers [aimed] to expand the monopoly of force to the territory of the state.\u201d (Del Sarto, 2017)  The British drew lines that bisected multiple ethnic and political power groups simply to better control a population.  The current disaster that is the Syrian conflict is a direct result of colonialist policies.  Given that over 465,000 people have died in the Syrian Conflict (Reuters 2017), and that the Syrian Conflict itself ultimately stems from the historical aftershocks of the colonial partitioning of the Levant into a half-dozen autonomous and semi-autonomous nations, I tend to view borders the same way I view weapons of mass-destruction.  In our current world we may think we need them, but having them may create more harm than good in the long run.  \n\n&gt;That conflict alone has done immeasurable harm in the world, and the refugee explosion that is the direct result of the conflict is one of the saddest catastrophes of the 21st century.  \u201cOver the last year, over a million people illegally crossed the borders of the EU.\u201d (fab@a-bg.org, 2016)  These people can\u2019t work legally in the countries they have fled to \u2013 they can\u2019t safely live \u2013 they are easy prey for those who would exploit them.  While saying that this is the fault of an imaginary line is a bit of a stretch \u2013 that much I\u2019ll acknowledge \u2013 but the reality is that if these people didn\u2019t have to worry about beatings in Bulgaria or human-trafficking in Hungary simply because they didn\u2019t have papers the world would be a demonstrably better place.  Why should children have to risk drowning or sex-slavery because they are fleeing a literal warzone?  Why should a line drawn on a map prevent their safe passage?\n \n\n&gt;Imagine if this was the same for state borders, and armed men would come and take you back to the state you were born in because 150 years ago someone decided that your descendants weren\u2019t allowed in without special permission.  Imagine if someone in Wisconsin decided that they wanted to hurt Bears fans, so they annexed half of the city of Chicago so the city couldn\u2019t unite well enough to riot after losing - that\u2019s exactly what a border is.  It may be easy from the relative comfort of life here in the US to say, \u201coh, we can\u2019t let those people cross the border\u201d because of some assumed fear that there\u2019s not enough wealth to go around \u2013 but really, what you\u2019re doing is enforcing laws that were put into place by your great-great grandparents.  Borders are structures manufactured out of the irrational fear of the \u201cother.\u201d  A border is designed to keep certain people out or keep certain people in, indeed they are as much prison walls as they are a garrison.  If you wince when you hear grandma make a racial slur, understand that a border is the same kind of social control that\u2019s been codified into law.  Borders are strategically designed to separate and control population groups.  Sometimes those groups are drawn are on linguistic lines, sometimes they are drawn on ethnic lines, other times those are lines drawn because of history or economics \u2013 but they certainly aren\u2019t real, and they aren\u2019t making things much better for anyone forced to live in them.\n\n&gt;An example of the asinine nature of borders can be found right in my home state of Alaska.  The Athabaskan people (in particular those who speak Gwitch\u2019in) have lived in Eastern Alaska and Northwestern Canada for literally millennia.  Before Alaska was \u201cAlaska\u201d they routinely crossed cycled between villages and campsites around the present border and across it.  Today, movement of those people is restricted.  They cannot easily get access to literally their land because someone drew a border along an arbitrary parallel well over 100 years ago.  How does that make the lives of either side of the border \u2013 many of whom are related \u2013 any better?\n\n&gt;\u201cBut if we didn\u2019t have borders, there\u2019d be a flood of people into the country \u2013 they\u2019d take all the jobs and depress wages.\u201d  This is invariably the next argument I always hear when talking to people about a borderless world.  I usually address this in a couple way \u2013 first, if your next-door neighbor was starving to death, or was destitute would it be ethical to simply let him starve?  Would it be alright to say, \u201coh, he didn\u2019t pull himself up by his bootstraps hard enough, screw him?\u201d  I don\u2019t think most people would argue that position in real life.  Generally speaking, we feel terrible when suffering befalls our friends \u2013 so what makes people who live adjacent to our country any different?  What makes it \u201cok\u201d that the quality of life across some arbitrary line is way lower because of history?  Is it \u201cok\u201d to tell people they don\u2019t deserve the same chances in life that you do?  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fine at all \u2013 in fact, I\u2019d say that we have a moral imperative to help people outside of our own country.  The philosopher Peter Singer agrees, and makes a compelling case for altruism when it won\u2019t hurt us much.  He equates altruism that barely affects you as being equivalent to saving a drowning child.  (Singer, 2009)  If it won\u2019t make things worse for us \u2013 or at worst only barely changes the economic situation \u2013 but vastly could increase the quality of life of those who live in poverty and fear in horrible and repressive parts of the world is it ethical to say, \u201ckeep out\u201d simply because we\u2019re worried about our jobs?  I wouldn\u2019t think so \u2013 would you let a child drown in a swimming pool because you\u2019d ruin your suit to jump in and save them?  Of course not.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s worse than that \u2013 all these tin pot dictators or wannabe dictators (extra emphasis on the \u201cdic\u201d) you hear about (Kim Jeong Un, Vladimir Putin, Bashar Al Assad, Saparmurat Niyazow, etc) consolidate their power through tight control over their borders.  Ever tried to get a Russian Visa?  I have \u2013 it\u2019s an utter nightmare (unless you know the right people who have Putin\u2019s ear, then easy-peasy).  North Korea is essentially a prison-nation.  You get the picture.  This whole paradigm doesn\u2019t exist if people stop respecting borders.  If nobody guarded the North Korean border do you think it\u2019d even be possible for it to be an autocracy?  Of course not.  Borders exist to clearly delineate who has power over what people \u2013 it\u2019s not about the ground they lie on, if you get rid of a border it frees people on both sides.\n\n&gt;So what does this hypothetical borderless Utopia look like?  I\u2019ll say for certain that if borders went away immediately and overnight, there\u2019d be chaos \u2013 I\u2019ll be the first to acknowledge that, but after a year or two, when the inevitable migrations started to settle down what would we see?  For one, while the wages might unfortunately drop here in the States, I have no doubt that the world-wide wages would rise.  How can you exploit people if they can simply move somewhere where they make more money?  We can actually see this in Europe, where Turks and Poles move into Western European cities for better wages doing the same jobs they\u2019d do at home.  Beyond that, what are the long-term consequences for war and conflict?   If the European Community is anything to look at, the peace in Western Europe is unparalleled in history.  While there have been the occasional low intensity ethnic or religious conflict, when contrasted with the previous 500 years the current struggles look anemic or simply non-existent.\nLet\u2019s not just think about the peace dividend, also consider the fact that if you don\u2019t have a border to defend what do you need a military to do?  Obviously, there\u2019d still be some need for soldiers to protect national interests, but if the goal isn\u2019t to \u201cprotect territory\u201d because we live in a world where that idea is meaningless, what would we really need to project power for?  If people ignored borders, moved around where they pleased, and generally \u201cvoted with their feet\u201d when they didn\u2019t like the policies of one country over another, what good does having a military do?  Think of the money and time that could be saved with a dramatically smaller military worldwide \u2013 how much money is wasted because we want to defend imaginary lines?  How much time is lost by byzantine customs policies and persnickety customs agents?  Think of the waste we could eliminate!\n\n&gt;It\u2019s not simply that borders are bad for your fellow man, empower repressive regimes and codify into law racist or colonialist policy, borders are expensive and wasteful.  Unless you\u2019re the leader of a quasi-dictatorial post-Soviet kleptocracy (I\u2019m looking at you President Aleksander Lukashenko of Belarus) your life will almost certainly improve without borders telling you where you\u2019re permitted to live \u2013 imagine that, where someone allows you to live.  And even if your life won\u2019t change \u2013 is it ethical to literally wall people out of success because it might cost you some money?  That doesn\u2019t seem right to me, and it shouldn\u2019t seem right to you either.  Let\u2019s solve the illegal immigration problem \u2013 let\u2019s get rid of borders!\n\n\u2003\n&gt;Bibliography:\n\n&gt;Raffaella A. Del Sarto.  (01 July 2017).

I understand that this vision does not fit in with the anarchist philosophy, but I do want different perspectives because it helps me understand my ideas better. \n\n\u2026...\n\nWe believe that humanities technological and social progress means that we now have the means and the resources to make it possible to end the struggle for survival for all human beings. We believe that every human being on this planet can have the food, water, clothing, shelter, medicine, safety, and education, not just to survive, but to thrive too.\n\nWe take it as self-evident that *if* all human beings can live in material security then all human beings *should* live in material security. Why? Because the struggle for survival not only causes immense suffering for the individual, but the means by which we attempt to meet our needs frequently causes immense and vast suffering in communities and between nations.\n\nPut simply, we would live in a much happier, more peaceful, and more evolved world if all human beings were free from the struggle for survival, and instead able to pursue their own interests and passions, and to nurture and express their talents, not only for their own personal fulfilment, but also for the betterment of our species.\n\nWe have entered a dark period for humanity. A time of escalating conflict and deep divides, and, yet, fundamentally we share and pursue the same needs and the same goals. Above all else, all human beings are united in the deepest, most primal wish for material security, for themselves and their loved ones. It is this common goal that unites all human beings, and which, in aspiring towards, we can unite and come together to achieve for the whole.\n\nIn the pursuit of this vision, I am deeply committed to listening to and understanding all sides, to finding common, agreed ground, and to working towards a solution, a compromise, a cooperation that is of mutual benefit to all. I have no interest in opposing anyone, defining enemies amongst my fellow human beings, judging who is right and who is wrong, fighting anyone or anything\u2026 as a species we can no longer afford such indulgences, nor do we have the time to bicker and quarrel amongst ourselves. Not whilst eight million children die because of poverty each year, not whilst nuclear weapons threaten our very existence, and not when environmental disaster looms over the very planet we need above all else to continue to survive.\n\nIf you are interested in reading more or becoming involved then you can follow us on Twitter, like our Facebook page, visit our website, or email us.

My gf is a senior, and we were all (separate conversations) talking about our futures. \n\nBefore I continue, let me say I do not harbor any want nor illusion of control over either them, I just feel disgusted by this: my friend wants to join the Air Force after high school for whatever reason, in a non-combatant role. I think he eventually wants to become a cosmetologist or something like that. \n\nMy gf on the other hand, wants to become a forensic chemist and \"solve crimes from a lab,\" to quote her directly. Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't that make them both apparatuses to criminal organizations? I mean, they're both taking non-combatant jobs but aren't they just becoming enforcers of State?\n\nAnyway, I understand that they need to make money but like this? And I am very close to them, but the fact that I would be dating a future police officer (again, correct me if I'm wrong) and be friends with a future soldier really turns me off to them. I love and respect the two of them, especially my gf, but I don't know if I can be around people like this. Please help! \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S.

I think it\u2019s reasonable to hold that property destruction which does not directly impact an individual\u2019s ability to eat, maintain shelter and\/or health to be permissible.\n\nEspecially in the context of destruction of weapons, the Plowshares idea to \u201cbeat the swords into plowshares\u201d is a classic example of this idea.\n\nI imagine in devising pacifist praxis, that destruction of the means of harm (weapons, telecommunication equipment, etc.) would be majorly effective in reducing casualties.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit\nCool, I guess this sub just can\u2019t have real discussions. \u270c\ud83c\udffb","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Discussion: Pacifism &amp; Property Destruction"}

From the painting of Columbus as a hero to justify colonialism to the glorification of Confederates as a dog whistle for racists to pose as patriots, the examples of this as essentially endless, and very little of history is untainted by nationalism or some other form of biggotry. The history of the struggle between the Soviet Union and the United States and Europe is of course no exception to this. \n\nIn my mind there are two major important differences between the United States and the Soviet Union: the US uses sham democracy to feign legitimacy, while the USSR used sham communism to feign legitimacy. What is similar is that both were or are oppressive authoritarian regimes that operate in the best interest of the state over the people. I don't think many people here would disagree with this. The issue is that many of us here would like to see the application of REAL democracy and REAL communism and that the history of the USSR has been used very effectively to demonize communism in a broad stroke that provides the right with a tool to attack any form of unselfish cooperation. \n\nThis is why I believe that rampant anti marxism probably does more to play into the hand of the right, at least in the west at this point in history, than it does to protect us from authoritarianism and why revisionist views of history, even if they attack the USSR, Marxist-Leninism, Maoism are dangerous and buying into terms like tankies is counter productive at this point. Furthermore, we should defend, to a point, those that call out revisionist history in order elevate the USSR to an effective equivalency with the US while continuing to point out the failure of the USSR or the US to effectively deliver democracy or communism. \n\nEdit- obviously a controversial topic, but I feel like it promoted a bit of conversation. I appreciate the fact that a similar discussion would have been deleted and possibly gotten me banned from Communist subreddits. \n \n\n\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Why I think it can be ok to defend the USSR as an anarchist."}
