When I come home, it's hard to muster up the willpower to do much of anything, and it's becoming easier than ever to succumb to methods of instant gratification: like eating junk food as opposed to a healthy meal or watching TV instead of exercising. It's just like the rest of the day is so unsatisfying, I need to ingest something that might make me feel good for just a little bit.\n\nWhat's worse is I feel like everyone else but me is more than okay with the state of things.

{"author":"trippingbilly0304","created_utc":1512531218,"num_comments":0,"score":5,"selftext":"So let me see if I got this straight:  If I challenge the power structure of the organization I work for, and/or have the nerve to not engage in billing fraud or waste, I'm an unemployed loser who doesn't even deserve medical benefits.  This, the conformity to a grey area where either direct participation in or indirect knowledge of state-noncompliant practice would have otherwise forwarded my career.  \n\nBUT if on the other hand I conform to professional and business pressures to conform to grey billing practices, having that, 'the sympathetic liberal' company owner's support, and were to, say, make a public spectacle of myself protesting a pipeline and getting arrested for 30 days, I could probably squeeze a continued employment out of the ordeal granted that the photos of the protest (within the margins of mainstream dissent) were enjoyed by my co-workers.  Then, I would be a 'true dissident.'  \n\nThis is the irony of the fetishization of disobedience.  Push to the edge of the margin and be recognized as a necessary social persona.  For any interested, Slavoj Zizek and Chomsky go into detail here.  True leftists are not interested in drawing attention to themselves for a noble cause.  Participation in organized social movements has become a destination for personality, personal gain, peer recognition--often the manifestation of the dissent is itself an acceptable-unacceptable display.  It negates actual change by presenting itself as such through the emotional experience of the participant.  \n\nReal change, the rise of individual names and leaders over the years, has been the result not of recognized people who publicly expressed dissent, but rather through the sum of microtrangressions carried out by the unknown:  the dead white Civil Rights workers in Mississippi (Chaney, Goodman, &amp; Schwerner), the nameless rioters in 1967 Detroit, the other African Americans who Rosa Parks watched subtly verbalize dissent on buses for weeks, months, years, the people who rotted in prison cells because of 1960s COINTELPRO, the dead coal miners in 1912 Cabin Creek, West Virginia who fought the company men for a living wage--the original rednecks--, the people standing up to police abuse in their communities today.  These are all examples of a mass of individual and group efforts to genuinely resist power structures at the risk of great loss.  \n\nThe now cultural acceptance of resistance has created a vacuum, a problem for the left--green policy, renewable energy, minority rights, worker rights, anti-fascism; the identity politik--which is how actual force is curtailed in a free-speech society.  It may otherwise be the case that small changes in conduct each day at the individual, anonymous level, although not anonymous for the individual, on a mass scale, is the beginning of real change.  \n\nPermit the spirit of the organized movement, but do not be fooled by the state's permission to do so--acts that are genuinely threatening to power structures are met with tactic and counterforce at the smallest level, a validation of its potential.  So while the largest movements may somehow not be a threat--consider the approval of the Trump Administration to permit the construction of Dakota Access Pipeline despite the internationally publisized protest--the smallest movements are where the focus must be.  We need coordinated resistance at the grass root level to disrupt individual organizations, made possible by individuals who are truly willing to sacrifice their own well-being.  \n\n\"But what if I lose my job?  I don't want to suffer.\"\n\n\"Then go be a 'true dissident' instead.\"\n\nYes a person needs to take care of him or herself, but the harsh truth my friends is that real change is not going to happen until we as individuals are willing to risk losing what matters in our own lives.  Sometimes doing the right thing may be doing nothing at all.  Or, if you cannot make something better, at least do not make it worse.  This is not a diminution of hope, it's a radical call to wake up and recognize how much power we do have.  ","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"The Power of One"}

I felt ashamed when I couldn't maintain a decent standard of living by myself, but I've gotten over it and I want to gripe about just how ridiculously exploitative it is for society to encourage young people to move out when it isn't really necessary. It's nothing but stupid \"rugged individualism\" propaganda meant to suck every possible penny out of the working class.\n\nI realize that many conrads don't have the privilege of living with family, for whatever reason. I'm not bashing those who \"make it on their own\" or don't have strong family ties. Some people need to escape from their families to save themselves. I get it. But, I think we on the left tend to ignore the importance of family. Perhaps we are apprehensive to seem like a \"traditionalist.\" \n\nKurt Vonnegut said something that has always stuck with me. (This was before gay marriage was legalized. It might come off as a little heteronormative, but I don't think it was the intent.)\n\n&gt;Why are so many people getting divorced today? It\u2019s because most of us don\u2019t have extended families anymore. It used to be that when a man and a woman got married, the bride got a lot more people to talk to about everything. The groom got a lot more pals to tell dumb jokes to.\n\n&gt;A few Americans, but very few, still have extended families. The Navahos. The Kennedys.\n\n&gt;But for most of us, if we get married nowadays, are just one more person for the other person. The groom gets one more pal, but it\u2019s a woman. The woman gets one more person to talk to about everything, but it\u2019s a man.\n\n&gt;When a couple has an argument nowadays, they may think it\u2019s about money or power or sex or how to raise the kids or whatever. What they\u2019re really saying to each other, thought without realizing it, is this: \u201cYou are not enough people!\u201d\n\n&gt;**A husband, a wife and some kids is not a family. It\u2019s a terribly vulnerable survival unit.**\n\nThe \"traditionalist\" view of the nuclear family is in effect destroying families across the globe. It's terribly atomizing. And along with economic pressures and bigotry, it contributes to the geographic dispersal and dissolution of families. So, I think we need not fear being seen as a traditionalist by encouraging *real* family values--values based on compassion, mutual aid, and emotional intimacy--instead of alienation, superstition, and patriarchal domination. And we definitely should actively speak out against the stigma of multi-generational living arrangements. Workers need to save their resources so we can help each other more.\n\n\\\n\nJust thinking out loud and could go for an interesting discussion","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"The capitalist stigma against multi-generational households is keeping the working class impoverished."}

Online here and across communities, there is a great deal of support for the anarchist ideas of freedom, equality, and collectivism. However, I think a lot of this gets channelled into fighting fringe fascist groups, arguing amongst each other, or working towards several goals with no general organisation.\n\nSo in your area (whether your state or country or town) what concrete, achievable goals could anarchist organisation work towards over the next ten years? This could be anything from providing an anarchist support network for those left behind by capitalism to opening a bookshop or collectivising all capitalist property entirely! Of course, I'm not asking you to share your location but to share ideas of goals I think would be good.\n\nIf we can start to identify these oppurtunities, we can start to organise towards them. If we can organise towards them, we can achieve them. And with each achievement, we become less of an antifa fringe group and more of a force for genuine change. This should be the image we project - an egalitarian group with utopian ideals but realistic goals, and one which is able to achieve them.\n\nAny ideas?\n\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"What concrete, achievable goal should anarchists have over the next ten years?"}

Adorno draws on Freudian theory to show how fascism manifests itself in the collective psyche and suggests that all fascist movements contain the seeds of their own destruction.\n\nUsing Freud's concept of 'idealization,' he outlines what fascist leaders represent for their believers:\n\n*\"We see that the object is being treated in the same way as our own ego, so that when we are in love a considerable amount of narcissistic libido overflows on the object.  It is even obvious, in many forms of love choice, that the object serves as a substitute for some unattained ego ideal of our own.  We love it on account of the perfections which we have striven to reach for our own ego, and which we should now like to procure in this roundabout way as a means of satisfying our narcissism.\"*\n\nThe masses, however, do not fully believe in their leader, he says, and this is why they are so impervious to reason and argument, because to employ reason means the whole charade collapses:\n\n*\"They do not really identify themselves with him but act this identification, perform their own enthusiasm, and thus participate in their leader's performance.   It is through this performance that they strike a balance between their continuously mobilized instinctual urges and the historical stage of enlightenment they have reached, and which cannot be revoked arbitrarily.\"*\n\nIt is this awareness of the phoniness of the act, the necessity to suspend reason in order to sustain it, that he says will ultimately lead to its demise, as adherence to the collective delusion is ultimately at variance with the individual's self-interest.\n\n*\"The collectivization and institutionalization of the spell...have made the transference more and more indirect and precarious so that the aspect of performance, the 'phoniness' of enthusiastic identification and of all the traditional dynamics of group psychology, have been tremendously increased.  This increase may well terminate in sudden awareness of the untruth of the spell, and eventually in its collapse.\"*\n\nBest way to hasten the demise of fascism?  Expose the spell for what it is.  One way I can think of is by befriending someone from one of the demonized groups and making a public display of unity.  When fascists see people of different backgrounds mixing and enjoying themselves, you can see a little twinge of anger play about the lips as the bubble is pierced a bit and their destructive fantasies are exposed for what they are.  The more of this they see, the less power the act of identification has for them.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Adorno on the Psychology of Fascism"}

While their is a lot of support for Anarchism their a fear of it that makes me rather concerned and saddened, we're afraid that without a State that their will be nothing stopping the majority casting us aside, we're (generally, not always, probably not the majority) more scared of Neurotypicals Ruining our lives than police (Something I disagree with) But that this idea exists makes me sad and afraid that most of us are so fearful of society harming us we see the State as the only possible source of protection against other people. I'm not sure what's causing this, but looking at these communities I've fallen in love with them and my Comrades in these groups. I wan't to be able to show them that other people for the most part won't hurt us, that  people who are Neurotypical can and will help us, that we aren't so alone we need the state for protection (Which it utterly fails to do)\n\nEDIT: Great comment by Emthree3\nSo, a big part of this, IME, is that while anarchists do support the mentally ill and ND, it doesn't really... reflect itself well in the movement. I mean at the risk of getting kinda sectarian, the fact is that very little literature exists on the matter, nor is there that much of a history of anarchist praxis against neurotypical rule. So if the one thing that tends to help disabled people out - the state - is gone, a lot of disabled people would feel kinda threatened by that. (Side note: Yes I am aware that pigs kill a ton of disabled people every year).\n\nAlso IME, anarchists tend to be bad at conveying themselves as allies to neurodivergent folks. And I don't mean in a liberal kind of way, where you just tweet something or share something on Facebook, I mean like, having answers for us when we ask. Back in my social democratic days, when I first inquired into the subject, most of the answers I got were - \"Well, we'd take care of you guys\". Nothing much on self-determination, nothing much on structure, nothing much on what this might look like, just a sort of hand-wavy reassurance, and to disabled folks that can be really unsettling because we often get a lot of aid from things that anarchists take issue with.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"A Concerning Fear Among Neurodivergents Of Anarchism (Please read full before commenting)"}

I know it sounds silly but bear with me...\n\nA blockchain would let us decentralize the system and maintain perfectly secure usernmes. How? We encode every post with every other post. Ever. Why send 12kb of data when you can send 30gb? This will make the system muchly more efficient, as well as keeping things anonymous by giving everyone a copy of everyone's data! \n\nObviously, this will take a bit more computing power than posting from your phone (becuz its so efficient). In order to deal with that we can encourage \"mining\" by giving people who use their own computer to process all of this data, by allowing them to post more than the rest of us, or to sell those opportunities to post. Since everyone on earth will soon be adopting this system, those posting opportunities will be worth big $$$, which will all go to us because obviously no large capitalists would ever invest in mining with large server farms and price us out of that market (markets yay!). \n\nBest of all, the decentralized atchitecture would make the network ungovernable. Anyone (who could afford to) could post anything they want, like offers to sell children, and nobody could stop them. If you're worried about those kids, just remember that half of those ads will be straight-up scams that take the money and run without ever enslaving kids, and this system will make it impossible to prevent that too. Anarchy!\n\nIn conclusion, I'm completely confident that this system will solve our Nazi problem because reasons. \n\n*This is what bitcoiners actualy believe*\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Why not blockchain?"}

{"author":"adonis28850","created_utc":1514144230,"num_comments":10,"score":20,"selftext":"Hi,\n\nI have seen recently many Anarchists discussing about cryptocurrencies and even recommending their use. I have written a very short essay that hopefully summarizes my view on the point, open to questions/comments/critics: \n\nCryptocurrencies seem to have gained a lot of traction since Bitcoin's inception in 2009. They are built based on a couple of relatively simple concepts, **blockchain** and **decentralization**.\nBlockchain, on a very high level, is a chain of elements, called blocks, that due to a number of mathematical principles cannot be altered. These blocks can represent any and many things, and are used to keep record of certain events or information. This chain is shared and publicly accessible by anyone, and therefore its structure can be seen as that of a decentralized system, where no single entity has control over it.\n\nThis technology - and its most well-known child, Bitcoin - sounded very appealing since its creation to those who believed that world's current situation is unsustainable, many saw in it a way of regaining control from governments, economical entities and other parties that use and abuse our current system for their benefit. A currency that does not belong to anyone but all, that due to its very nature is anonymous-friendly and therefore difficult to tax, certainly sounded promising. In the early beginnings, when the ball started rolling, plenty of online and offline businesses and particulars started to use bitcoin to make or accept payments, it was as easy as using your home computer to mine some coins in a relatively small fraction of time, and then off you went, the world was yours, and the best part is that the IRS did not know!. Those were, no doubt, the good old times, when the hacker community - the real ones, and not that parody that Hollywood and the media have created - and a group of people discontent with how the world is ran embraced this technology and pushed for it.\n\nFast forward to today, end of 2017, Bitcoin being **traded** at $16.000 and growing, or so they say. Online **exchanges** allowing you to get into the fuzz, **states** giving it legitimacy, **hedge funds** and other **financial entities** offering cryptocurrency **investments**, its value being **manipulated** by people holding an enormous amount of it, Bitcoin only being used to **speculate** with its value for **profit**, and the list goes on and on. But let's stop there and just have a look at those terms I just highlighted: trade, exchange companies, states, hedge funds, financial entities, investments, manipulation, speculation, profit... what does that sound like to you?.\n\nCryptocurrencies were meant to disrupt the system, to break the status-quo and allow people to claim the power they so much deserve, and yet, it all has been perverted by the very same principles that constitute Capitalism, mainly by the scariest one, individual profit. A potentially good idea, founded on the basis of a new and powerful technology such as blockchain, but that seems to be heading to the same place where we are at currently. A few privileged ones - do not forget that only approximately 50% of world's population has access to the Internet, which is cryptocurrencie's only habitat; and out of that 30%, only a few have the economical power to buy cryptocurrencies or the resources to \"create\" them - with the resources to gain access to this new market, because that is what it has become, an economical market, the rest just kept out of the game and powerless, as Capitalism dictates.\n\nWe do not need an alternative currency, we do not need another fictitious construct that gives value to how we interact with each other. What we need is a society that does not create greedy and economical profit-seeking human beings, but one where we all row in the same direction without any hidden agenda; where we empower, respect and complement each other and the environment we live in, and where happiness is not measured by how many zeroes we have in our bank account, but by the happiness of that next to us. And I am afraid that such a society will never be possible as long as we have any form of currency, no matter its name - $, \u20ac, \u00a3 - they all have to go!.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"On Cryptocurrencies"}

You have the right to be safe from predators and violent abusers. If you have been sexually or physically abused, I apologize on behalf of our sick planet. It is absolutely not your fault, and your parents, family, and community are all responsible for what happened. Sexual abuse is the worst thing because it leaves no obvious scar, and often creates a society of enablers who keep the secret. Physical abuse is accepted in so many communities as a way to \u201cdiscipline\u201d a child with the same total lack of respect and conscience that they were shown as children. What they are really doing is creating angry, violent, unhappy people just like them. You must somehow find a way to escape and then rise above the cycle of abuse.\n\n1a. You have the right to be safe before birth. You should not be exposed to drugs, alcohol, pollutants, or high levels of stress in the womb.\n\n1b. You have the right to your foreskin or clitoris. Ritual genital mutilation, or \u201ccircumcision\u201d, is a vicious practice designed to inflict sexual, physical and emotional abuse on a helpless infant.\n\n2. You have the right to be respected by your parents or any adult caretaker. You should never be verbally abused. If you are being verbally or emotionally abused, then you must remember that the person is acting out their own childhood abuse on you, and try to educate them about cycles of abuse if possible. Try and focus your pain and rage into some kind of achievement, rather than taking it out on others.\n\n3. You have the right to know about cycles of abuse in your family and on this planet. If every person in the world became aware of the cycles of abuse in their own families, that awareness would soon grow to their entire community and beyond. The vast majority of people on this planet are in deep denial about everything. Many things are not appropriate to tell much less show a child and yet you've been exposed to them anyway.\n\n4. You have the right to clean air, water, and food. There is none at this time, every drop of water on earth is now polluted to some extent. However, your access to relatively clean air, water and food will determine your quality of life.\n\n5. You have the right to be drug and cancer free. Research shows that almost universally, babies are born infested with over 200 chemicals, and those are only the ones that can be tested for. The chemicals parents choose to give their children usually cause the more harm.\n\n6. You have the right to live in nature. Humans cannot flourish in a technological environment.\n\n7. You have the right to a culture that is not hyperviolent, pornographic and designed to divide and destroy you. Modern mainstream culture/religion promotes and glamorizes the cycles of abuse.\n\n8. You have the right to a well rounded education that emphasizes your strengths and teaches you to be independent. You have the right to a future occupation which does not perpetuate the cycles of abuse. You have the right to learn about psychology and self defense. State schools are run as factories, and you will be encountering extremely abused children with every type of mental disorder there.\n\n9. You have the right to a community that punishes child abusers harshly, and prioritizes children above all else. You have the right to a community whose laws protect the children and not the predators. No such community exists at this time. I'm writing this with the hopes that you, the children, will create one for yourselves.\n\n10. You have the right to truth. Your parents should never lie to you. However, your parents probably don't know the truth about institutional child abuse. The religious, financial, and military sectors that rule this world attract predators of every stripe. Predators often seek positions of \u201ctrusted authority figure\u201d. You cannot trust most people, because they are all abused children acting out their abuses, consciously and unconsciously. There are entire industries, most totally legal, designed to lie, steal and kill. Your parents brought you into a world ruled by fear and the conspiracy of silence that follows it. There's more but you're just a kid. Welcome to Earth.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTox Simian\n\ntcbor.org","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"The Children's Bill of Rights"}

I was able to get some phone numbers for shelters, legal aid, and mental health in the local area if she needs it. They said that I should contact the police and file a report if I get more information, but without having an address or full names there probably isn't much the police can do.\n\nEDIT 2: I called the police dept. of the area where the married couple lives to file a report. They said because the abuse happened in a different county there is nothing they can do. And even then without an address they can't really do anything. I was told to contact the police in my county where the abuse happened, and they can maybe send a unit to investigate. I am very conflicted on whether I should make the call to local PD or not.\n\nEDIT 3: I contacted the local Adult Abuse Hotline. They said that it may not fall into their jurisdiction. They are passing it onto their supervisor to see if it does or not. They will call back if it does.\n\nI am really not sure where to post this. I just really need some help. \n\nI work in the shipping dept. of a salvage company. Our local delivery/courier service that picks up from us is usually at our location by 3:00PM. Today he was an hour late. \n\nThe guy who picks up from us has been a known hot head. He constantly gets angry over just having too much stuff, or easily avoidable problems, and he throws our parts around. He actually got fired for two days for blowing up at his boss, but they couldn't find a replacement to run his route. So they had to rehire him.\n\n About a month ago he started bringing his wife in to work with him. They've been married for 22 years, and they are both mid 50's or so. She broke her neck and had surgery, and she was in a brace up until a week or two ago. She is still supposed to wear the brace, but she just stopped. I've talked to her many times and she clearly isn't mentally all there.  I am not a doctor or psychologist, so I don't know what the proper terminology is or whats wrong. But clearly something is not right. \n\nQueue today, the wife came in crying and near hysterical. She requested to go to the bathroom right away, and we helped her with that. The husband/driver was out loading all our parts when she finally came out of the bathroom. We asked her what is wrong. She said, \"He grabbed me by the neck and hurt me. I don't think I can go back with him.\" She had tears streaming down her face, and she was clearly terrified. She said, \"I think he'll kill me if I go back with him.\"\n\nThis is something I don't take lightly at all regardless of the situation, so the first thing I did was grab my boss. His answer was essentially \"It's not our problem.\" Go fucking figure. I go back to her and I gently took her hands and said, \"Look I am really concerned for you. You don't have to go with him. I can take you somewhere safe. Social services, a relative, or just somewhere. I am really afraid for you, and I don't think you should get back in the van with him. I will drive you wherever you need to go.\" \n\nAt this point she pulled away and said, \"No I'll be fine.\" \"I have to go back with him.\"\n\nI responded, \"please let me help you. You don't have to go back.\"\n\nShe said, \"the worst he can do is kill me.\" At this point she walked away, and I couldn't stop her. She was set on going back.\n\nThis is where I need help. I feel so scared for her, and I don't know what to do. I've never been in a situation like this, and I really think she needs help.\n\nI am skeptical about calling the cops because I just feel like she won't go with them or let them do anything about it, and then he might lash out on her. \n\nMy boss already made the decision to call the delivery company manager to tell them about his behavior. Again this terrifies me because I feel like if he gets fired, he will take it out on her.\n\nIs there anything I can do? Anyone I can call? \n\nI also already know telling my boss was a huge mistake. You don't need to remind me. \n\nIf mods need me to PM my main account I will, but using a throwaway, VPN, and throwaway email for obvious reasons. Fash lurk here and I don't want them interfering.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Potential Domestic Abuse Need Help!!!!"}

I was trying to get a job at a freight warehouse that happens to be a special class of international shippemets so homeland security is involved in monitoring the freight so there are extra security procedures like crazy. Anyways The temp service is just not getting back to me on this job, even though I have worked with them at plenty of places. So I feel I have passively detected I am on a watch list or something, probably based on unfriendly statements that are just shy of illegal I have made online. \n\nthere must also be other ways of doing this. Temporary workers might be asked to do work on a US base, only IF they have a low level security clearance though, and you can google it how to do it like work on us base temporary clearance or something - you go through the department of the interior or some such dept and it does cost some money like $100. I would get hooked up with a temp service that does manual labor, especially if there are bases nearby, as you can be offered a job at such. You never ask anyone for the clearance, or 'I would really like to work at a military base' you sort of let it come to you so to speak so as not obvious. Then you go get your clearance. Maybe if you pass you are not on a watch list? \n\nI am NOT suggesting doing something to a US base, which would be idiotic, at all. I am saying you can plausibly request a clearance for this reason , work, and thus see if they clear you. \n\nI am pretty sure i am on one already myself, which is fine I am not going to do anything except go to rallies and maybe take a swing at beating a neonazi sometime, barehanded, ever in my life, but I guess they can waste resources following me around like idiots.

Here is my counter-argument: \n\n(A) **Statistical counter-evidence:** [The Flynn effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect) shows that population IQs change far too rapidly to be indicative of genetic changes in intelligence, which shows that IQ is an unreliable indicator of the genetic basis of intelligence at the level of populations. Jim Flynn's research also showed that differences in IQ between racial groups is not a reliable indicator of genetic differences in intelligence between races, because racial IQ gaps have changed at a rate too rapid to be indicative of genetic changes in human populations. For example, whites in the 1940s had an [**equal or lower**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence#Flynn_effect_and_the_closing_gap) IQ on average than African Americans in the 1990s. That is a span of merely 50 years. Additionally, in less than 40 years the racial IQ gap between African Americans and whites has decreased [substantially](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence#Flynn_effect_and_the_closing_gap) - by 39%, from 16.33 to 9.94. \n\n(B) **A Lack of Scientific Evidence:** Any credible argument that there are genetic differences in intelligence between racial groups, [requires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzrGLb-NFo8) biological evidence of causative gene(s)/protein(s)/biological pathways(s) that account for this difference. Additionally, this evidence must stand up to the rigor and scrutiny inherent in the natural sciences. Statistical correlations, which comprise [the majority - see 32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzrGLb-NFo8) of evidence that Race Realists use to support their arguments, do not fulfill this requirement. And past research often cited by Race Realists - such as that of [Bruce Lahn - see 33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzrGLb-NFo8) - that claimed to find causative biological evidence, was actually thoroughly discredited by subsequent research done to test to veracity of those claims. \n\n(C) **Fallacious Logic:** I have often seen the following logic used by Race Realists (paraphrasing) - \"Because the majority of a trait's manifestation in an individual is genetic, the majority of the difference in how the trait (intelligence) manifests between two individuals is probably also based on genetic differences. Logically, this should apply to differences in intelligence between groups as well.\" This is **not true**. Here's a simple illustration that indicates why: Let's say I have two bottles of the same size. I pour two types of liquid into each bottle - oil and water. The majority of liquid poured into each bottle is water and a minority is oil. However, the total volume of liquid is different between the two bottles. And you do not know if the ratio of oil to water is the same between the two bottles or not. Is the difference in total liquid volume between the two bottles mostly due to difference in the volume of water between the two bottles, or due to the difference in the volume of oil between the two bottles? The answer is that we cannot know this based on the information we have. We cannot even say \"it's probably oil\" or \"it's probably water\". Now think of \"oil\" as an analog for \"environmental contribution to intelligence\", \"water\" as an analog for \"genetic contribution to intelligence\", and \"total volume of liquid\" as an analog for \"quantified intelligence\". \n\n","subreddit":"debatepoliticalphil","title":"[Argument]: The Case Against \"Race Realism\"""num_comments":0,"score":16,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"[Argument]: The Case Against \"Race Realism\" (For your use in debates with right-wingers)"}

My goal is to (in simulation) achieve ISDN-level bandwidth using sub-ghz band packet radio to achieve long distance and segmented multipath routing to compensate for packet radio's low bandwidth. Transceiver SoCs for things like LoRa for IoT purposes are ~$5.00 now, so stacking them to work massively in parallel can increase shitty bandwidth by 2 (or 3?) orders of magnitude theoretically for under $1000.  A city of pop 1mil with 10,000 users would have to spend $100 each to have each node serve 10 people, assuming 1 of every 10 interested has the technological know-how to manage a node and teach the other 9 how to hook their computer up to a subghz radio transceiver. I've done calculations to find this to be the limit that would allow the shutdown of all ISPs to have minimal impact.
