One of these ideas is freedom, in a broad sense, and as part of it the freedom of each one to express their beliefs, no matter if those beliefs are in contrast to others. Although many people will give this different names, and will - rightly so - say that further nuances are needed, let's call this \"freedom of speech\", just for the sake of the argument.\n\n\nNow, the thing that bothers me, can be summarised in this sentence from a recent CrimethInc article (https://crimethinc.com/2017/01/26/this-is-not-a-dialogue-not-just-free-speech-but-freedom-itself):\n\n\n&gt;&gt;Obviously, anarchists should not organize against free speech. But the stranglehold of the state on the discourse of free speech seems to set the terms of the debate: either we condone censorship, or we condone state protection of our enemies and their right to organize against us and others. **This results in paradoxes, such as radicals being accused of opposing freedom for shutting down a fascist speaker.**\n\n\nAnd that last line (in bold), is where I am kind of stuck at!. I get the argument of people saying that one thing is free speech, and another thing is hate speech. Or the argument that freedom of speech can only take place in a society where we are all treated equal. Or... many other arguments that make perfect sense to me, but that are still not enough to convince me.\n\n\nSo, where I see the trouble is in the subjectivity of what is good or bad, of what is speech and what is hate, of what is an uncomfortable opinion or an aggression (verbal or physical). I am going to give you an example, that cannot be extrapolated directly to the topic I am discussing, but that hopefully will give you an idea in case I have not been clear enough of what troubles me.\nComedy. Within comedy there is the never-ending discussion of what the limits in comedy are. But, how can we define the limits, when what is offensive is something subjective? My partner is German, she does not get offended by me making jokes about Nazis and Germans, but surely other people in Germany will not laugh at my jokes, and will get offended!. So let's say that we set the limit there... but then, some people get offended by jokes about blonde women, even though I do not, so... let's lower the bar!. But hold on, some people also get offended by....... I guess you know where this is going.\n\n\nNow, as I said, this is not directly applicable to freedom of speech, and fascists talking and doing fucked up shit, but in a way is kind of related I think. We may agree that one thing is freedom of speech, and another one is to promote hate speech or a violence discourse, alright, but... who or what defines what and what not is considered to be some of these things?!\nThere are clear examples, if someone says \"all black people should die cause they are an inferior race and they got nothing to contribute to society\", well, that is pretty fucked up and most people would agree that is hate speech. But it is the more blurry and border-limit cases that trouble me! What may constitute hate speech for some, for other may be just uncomfortable opinions that they disagree with, but that consider to be tolerable.\n\n\nI don't know, this is a difficult and complex topic, or at least it seems so to my small brain, so just I hope you understood the idea I was trying to transmit, and don't get caught up in the thousand of little mistakes or inaccuracies I may have made, and just share some opinions!\n\n\nCheers.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"On Freedom of Speech""num_comments":7,"score":9,"selftext":"","subreddit":"DebateAnarchism","title":"On Freedom of Speech"}

Reddit shifting to closed-source should have been enough of a catalyst for exodus, but now the reddit corporation is doubling down on Authoritarian Liberalism.\n\nSo I thought I'd make a quick and easy guide for all you Anarchist Thugs to move yourself towards both open and secure methods of online communication. With the exception of Wikipedia, the US' top 10 Alexa ranked websites can be replaced. For more info, check [Prism-Break](http://prism-break.org/). Android users can find most of these on F-Droid, but can use the YALP store frontend for anything on the Play Store. \n\n**Desktop Operating Systems:**\n\n* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) - The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause to create a free operating system. This operating system that we have created is called Debian. Debian comes with over 51000 packages, a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free. Some security-focused Debian distributions include [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/) and the in-development [Subgraph](https://subgraph.com/), avoid Ubuntu as it contains Amazon-ads.  *Alternative to MacOS/Windows*\n* [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) - The Fedora Project is a community of people working together to build a free and open source software platform and to collaborate on and share user-focused solutions built on that platform. The Fedora community includes thousands of individuals with different views and approaches, but together we share some common values. We call these the \u201cFour Foundations\u201d: Freedom, Friends, Features, and First. A security-based Fedora distribution is [Qubes](https://www.qubes-os.org/). *Alternative to MacOS/Windows*\n* [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) - FreeBSD is an operating system used to power modern servers, desktops, and embedded platforms. A large community has continually developed it for more than thirty years. Its advanced networking, security, and storage features have made FreeBSD the platform of choice for many of the busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices. *Alternative to MacOS/Windows*\n\n**Mobile Operating Systems:** [Replicant](https://www.replicant.us/) - Replicant is a fully free Android distribution running on several devices, a free software mobile operating system putting the emphasis on freedom and privacy/security. It is based on [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) and replaces or avoids every proprietary component of the system, such as user-space programs and libraries as well as firmwares.\nReplicant aims to be an ethical system: it does not ship nor recommend the use of non-free software. *Alternative to Android/Blackberry/iOS/Windows*\n\n**Live Operating Systems:** [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/) - The Amnesic Incognito Live System (TAILS) is a security-focused Debian-based Linux distribution aimed at preserving privacy and anonymity. All its outgoing connections are forced to go through Tor, and non-anonymous connections are blocked. The system is designed to be booted as a live DVD or live USB, and will leave no digital footprint on the machine unless explicitly told to do so.\n\n**Email and VPN Accounts:**\n\n* [Autistici/Inventati](https://www.autistici.org/) - A/I was born to provide internet support to activists and collectives coming from the world of grassroot and social movements. Our principles are fairly straightforward: the world should not be run on money, but it should be rooted in solidarity, community, mutual help, equal rights and freedoms, and social justice. We support individuals, collectives, communities, groups and so on whose political and social activities fit within this worldview and who share with us some fundamental principles: anti-fascism, anti-racism, anti-sexism and anti-militarism. *Alternative to Facebook/Gmail/Outlook/Yahoo*\n* [Riseup](https://riseup.net/en) - The Riseup Collective is an autonomous body based in Seattle with collective members world wide. Our purpose is to aid in the creation of a free society, a world with freedom from want and freedom of expression, a world without oppression or hierarchy, where power is shared equally. We do this by providing communication and computer resources to allies engaged in struggles against capitalism and other forms of oppression. *Alternative to Facebook/Gmail/Outlook/Yahoo*\n\n**Email Clients:**\n\n* [K-9 Mail](https://k9mail.github.io/) - K-9 Mail is an independent email application for the Android operating system. It is made available as FLOSS. The program is marketed as a more functional replacement for the default mail application included on most phones. [OpenKeychain](https://www.openkeychain.org/) together with K-9 Mail provides end-to-end email encryption. An experimental project is [GnuPG for Android](https://guardianproject.info/code/gnupg/) by the Guardian Project.\n* [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) - A free and open-source cross-platform email client, news client, RSS and chat client for desktop operating systems, developed by the Mozilla Foundation. [Here is a guide](https://securityinabox.org/en/thunderbird_main) by Security In A Box to encrypting your email with Mozilla Thunderbird, [GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)](http://www.gnupg.org/), and [Enigmail](https://www.enigmail.net/index.php/en/).\n\n\n**Web Browsers:** \n\n* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) - A free and open-source web browser developed by Mozilla. Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards. To avoid interface bloat and ship a relatively smaller core customizable to meet individual users' needs, and allow for corporate or institutional extensions to meet their varying policies, Firefox relies on a robust extension system to allow users to modify the browser according to their requirements instead of providing all features in the standard distribution. Install the following add-ons to ensure your privacy: CookieAutoDelete, Decentraleyes, Disconnect, HTTPS Everywhere, Mailvelope, NoScript, Privacy Badger and uBlock Origin. *Alternative to Chrome/Internet Explorer/Opera/Safari*\n* [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) - The Tor network is a group of volunteer-operated servers that allows people to improve their privacy and security on the Internet. Tor's users employ this network by connecting through a series of virtual tunnels rather than making a direct connection, thus allowing both organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy. Along the same line, Tor is an effective censorship circumvention tool, allowing its users to reach otherwise blocked destinations or content. Tor can also be used as a building block for software developers to create new communication tools with built-in privacy features. *Alternative to Chrome/Internet Explorer/Opera/Safari*\n\n**Search Engines:**\n\n* [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) - An Internet search engine that emphasizes protecting searchers' privacy and avoiding the filter bubble of personalized search results. DuckDuckGo distinguishes itself from other search engines by not profiling its users and by deliberately showing all users the same search results for a given search term, and emphasizes returning the best results, rather than the most results, generating those results from over 400 individual sources, including crowdsourced sites such as Wikipedia, and other search engines like Bing, Yahoo!, and Yandex. *Alternative to Bing/Google/Yahoo*\n* [Startpage](https://www.startpage.com/)/[Ixquick](https://www.ixquick.eu/) - A metasearch engine, which highlights privacy as its distinguishing feature. Ixquick (and its sister-project, Starpage) also provides the stand-alone proxy service, Ixquick Proxy, which has also been incorporated into both search engines, allowing users the option to open all search results via proxy. *Alternative to Bing/Google/Yahoo*\n* [YaCy](http://search.yacy.net/) - A free search engine that anyone can use to build a search portal for their intranet or to help search the public internet. When contributing to the world-wide peer network, the scale of YaCy is limited only by the number of users in the world and can index billions of web pages. It is fully decentralized, all users of the search engine network are equal, the network does not store user search requests and it is not possible for anyone to censor the content of the shared index. We want to achieve freedom of information through a free, distributed web search which is powered by the world's users. *Alternative to Bing/Google/Yahoo*\n\n**Social Media:**\n\n* [Diaspora*](https://diasporafoundation.org/) - Diaspora is a nonprofit, user-owned, distributed social network that is based upon the free Diaspora software. Diaspora consists of a group of independently owned nodes (called pods) which interoperate to form the network. The social network is not owned by any one person or entity, keeping it from being subject to corporate take-overs or advertising. In September 2011 the developers stated, \"...our distributed design means no big corporation will ever control Diaspora. Diaspora* will never sell your social life to advertisers, and you won\u2019t have to conform to someone\u2019s arbitrary rules or look over your shoulder before you speak.\" *Alternative to Facebook*\n* [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) - Mastodon is a distributed and federated social network, with microblogging features similar to Twitter but administered as a decentralized federation of independently operated servers running free software. Each user is member of a specific Mastodon server, known as an \"instance\", but can connect and communicate with users on other instances as well. Users post short messages, called toots for others to read, or view, subject to the completely adjustable privacy settings of the user and their particular instance. *Alternative to Twitter*\n* [Raddle](https://raddle.me/) - Raddle's software is free &amp; open source, released under a permissive license. This is in contrast to Reddit, which just closed the curtains on its source code. Our software has no dependencies on paid web services from Amazon and few dependencies otherwise, making it easy for hobbyists to set up their own sites with the software. Our belief is that freedom from harm trumps freedom of speech. Contrary to what some people believe, Raddle isn't exclusively a site for anarchists, although they are the largest demographic. Socialists of all stripes, social democrats, liberals, conservatives and anyone else who wants to partake in a community where bigotry isn't tolerated in the name of \"free speech\" is welcome to join. The one condition is that bigotry stays out of the picture. *Alternative to reddit*\n\n**Communication:**\n\n* [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) - An encrypted communications app for all platforms. It uses the Internet to send one-to-one and group messages, which can include files, voice notes, images and videos, and make one-to-one voice and video calls. Signal uses standard cellular mobile numbers as identifiers, and uses end-to-end encryption to secure all communications to other Signal users. The applications include mechanisms by which users can independently verify the identity of their messaging correspondents and the integrity of the data channel. It has a counterpart in [Silence](https://silence.im/), which forked from Signal to provide encryption for SMS/MMS. *Alternative to Apple Messages/Facebook Messenger/Telegram/WhatsApp*\n* [Jabber/XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) - A communications protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML (Extensible Markup Language). It enables the near-real-time exchange of structured yet extensible data between any two or more network entities. The protocol was developed for near real-time instant messaging (IM), presence information, and contact list maintenance. Designed to be extensible, the protocol has been used also for publish-subscribe systems, signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming, the Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as the smart grid, and social networking services. [Server/Account list](https://xmpp.net/directory.php), [Conversations (Android App)](https://conversations.im/), [Jitsi (Desktop App)](https://jitsi.org/). *Alternative to Apple Messages/Facebook Messenger/Telegram/WhatsApp*\n* [Linphone](https://www.linphone.org/) - Linphone is a free voice over IP softphone, SIP client and service. It may be used for audio and video direct calls and calls through any VoIP softswitch or IP-PBX. Also Linphone provides the possibility to exchange instant messages. It has a simple multilanguage interface based on GTK+ for GUI and can also be run as a console-mode application on Linux. It supports ZRTP for end-to-end encrypted voice and video communication. *Alternative to Facetime/Skype*\n* [Mumble](https://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page) - Mumble is a voice over IP (VoIP) application primarily designed for use by gamers. Mumble uses a client\u2013server architecture which allows users to talk to each other via the same server. It has a very simple administrative interface and features high sound quality and low latency. All communication is encrypted to ensure user privacy. Mumble is free and open-source software, is cross-platform, and is released under the terms of the new BSD license. *Alternative to Teamspeak/Ventrilo*\n\n**DNS:** [OpenNIC](https://www.opennic.org/) - A user-owned and -controlled top-level Network Information Center that offers a non-national alternative to traditional Top-Level Domain (TLD) registries such as ICANN. OpenNIC recognizes and peers all existing ICANN TLDs, for compatibility reasons. However, OpenNIC has not yet evaluated and does not hold a formal position on future ICANN TLDs. Like all alternative root DNS systems, OpenNIC-hosted domains are unreachable to the vast majority of Internet users, because they require a non-default configuration in one's DNS resolver.\n\n**Mapping Service:** [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) - Collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map information across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices. OSM is considered a prominent example of volunteered geographic information. It has an unofficial mobile app, OsmAnd. *Alternative to Apple/Bing/Google Maps*\n\n**File Storage and Sync:** [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) - Suite of client-server software for creating and using file hosting services. It is free and open-source, allowing anyone to install and operate it on a private server. The open architecture allows adding additional functionality to the server in form of applications and enables the user to have full control of their data. *Alternative to Dropbox/Google Drive/iCloud/OneDrive*\n\n**VPN Client and Server:** [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) - An open-source software application that implements virtual private network (VPN) techniques for creating secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities. It uses a custom security protocol that utilizes SSL/TLS for key exchange. It is capable of traversing network address translators (NATs) and firewalls. \n\n**Anonymizing Network:** [I2P](https://geti2p.net/en/) - I2P is an anonymous network, exposing a simple layer that applications can use to anonymously and securely send messages to each other. The network itself is strictly message based (a la IP), but there is a library available to allow reliable streaming communication on top of it (a la TCP). All communication is end to end encrypted (in total there are four layers of encryption used when sending a message), and even the end points (\"destinations\") are cryptographic identifiers (essentially a pair of public keys).\n\n**Crypto-currency:** [Monero](https://getmonero.org/) - An open-source cryptocurrency that focuses on privacy and decentralization that runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and FreeBSD. Monero uses a public ledger to record transactions while new units are created through a process called mining. Monero aims to improve on existing cryptocurrency design by obscuring sender, recipient and amount of every transaction made as well as making the mining process more egalitarian. \n\n**Mesh Networking:** [Byzantium](http://project-byzantium.org/faqs/) - Byzantium is a live Linux distribution based on Porteus Linux that delivers easy-to-use, secure, and robust mesh networking capabilities. The goal of Project Byzantium is to develop a communication system by which users can connect to each other and share information in the absence of convenient access to the Internet. This is done by setting up an ad-hoc wireless mesh network that offers services which replace popular websites often used for this purpose, such as Twitter and IRC.\n\nRemember to use [Strong Passwords](https://www.xkcd.com/936/), encrypt your disks and steer clear of the proprietors! \n\nEDIT: This post is being actively updated with links and extra information, keep checking back for more. \n\nEDIT 2: Seriously though, remember to floss, it's good for your teeth :)","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Crypto-Anarchism - Or, the duty of remembering to FLOSS"}

Each user is member of a specific Mastodon server, known as an \"instance\", but can connect and communicate with users on other instances as well. Users post short messages, called toots for others to read, or view, subject to the completely adjustable privacy settings of the user and their particular instance. The Mastodon mascot is a brown or grey Proboscidean sometimes depicted using a tablet or smartphone.The service seeks to distinguish itself from Twitter through its orientation towards independently operated small communities and hence a community-based, rather than top-down, moderation. Like Twitter, Mastodon supports direct, private messages between users, but unlike \"tweets\" posted on Twitter, Mastodon\u2019s \"toots\" can be either: private to the user, private to the user's followers, public on a specific instance, or public across a network of instances. The network of federated Mastodon instances forms one part of the Fediverse, a federated network that includes servers running any social network software that uses either OStatus and, since version 1.6, the newer ActivityPub standard.\n\nList of General and/or Anarchy-related instances (Sorted by User Count, descending order):\n\n* [Mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/about) is by far the most widely used instance.

We provide a small community space - be excellent to each other (and read the rules if you're not sure what that means). \n\n* [Social.coop](https://social.coop/about) - A co-op corner of the fediverse and probably the most user-friendly social platform around!

At first it only deprived Jews of their civil and human rights. It\u2019s possible that without World War II the \u201cJewish problem\u201d would have ended only with the \u201cvoluntary\u201d expulsion of Jews from Reich lands. After all, most of Austria and Germany\u2019s Jews made it out in time. It\u2019s possible that this is the future facing Palestinians. \n\nThe danger of fascism have no boundary of difference color or culture. There are the increasing similarity between former Nazi Germany and many world's powers, including US, Russia, China, etc... But one that stood out the most is Israel. Liberals wanted you to believe that fascism is Euro-centric and only lingering at certain culture because of historic change. In fact, liberal wanted you to believe that Israel is a liberal democratic state, like US or other Western countries. This post is to point out why Israel is a crypto-fascist state, what factors that lead to it, and the danger of dismissing fascism.\n\n#A - Dehumanization\n\nDehumanizing their target of demography or group in the society is the foremost tenet of a fascist doctrine. It normalizes the crisis, separate and identity assassinate the people who tried to aid their target. This is the most ironic and striking similarity between Nazi Germany and Israel. In 1940s leading to The Final Solution, fascists used the term \"vermin\" to dehumanize Jews. The same term [is now used to address](http://muzzlewatch.com/2011/01/12/standwithus-comic-book-portrays-activist-palestinians-and-allies-as-vermin-reminiscent-of-nazi-propaganda/) Palestinians, [and the word \"snakes\".](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/05/07/israels-new-justice-minister-considers-all-palestinians-to-be-the-enemy/?utm_term=.de9a9b1a50ed)\n\n#B - Indoctrination\n\nWhile Palestinians are the victims, Jewish youths in the fascism society are also indirect victims subjected to indoctrination, propaganda and exploitation. The core factors of indoctrination are ultra-nationalism, ethno-state, ultra-religious while whitewashing and pinkwashing progressive cultures to ease the watering down of targeted propaganda. This tactic was the most effective by the Nazi, the root of UBI came from Nazi Germany to brainwash Germans into joining their party. Israel is also doing exactly the same tactic to provide benefit and security for those who willing to fight the Palestinian. While military service are mandatory, those who willing to fight have more social assistance and status than those who resist.\n\n#C - Segregation\n\nThe next step of oppressing your demographic targets is to isolate them from the population you want to indoctrinate with the most in-the-book gimmick by any imperialist state: segregation. Palestinians and most Israeli Arabs cannot vote. In a democratic society, voting is the foremost right to a citizen, yet the so-called \"only democracy\" segregate their citizens based on skin color and culture difference. The fact that the rest of the world choose to ignore that Palestinians living in the world's largest concentration/segregation camps in the 20th and 21st centuries is the reason that the crypto-fascism working excellently. How about a nice ghetto or labor camp in Poland?\n\n#D - Mystifying\n\nTo normalize their atrocities, they use another excellent tactic that the Nazis were so efficiently at it: myths, beliefs and religions. The Nazis obsessed with pagan and Germanic culture, they are infamously known for robbing and pillaging historic arts and cultures from places they stationed. Israel are doing the same, only to reversely indoctrinate Christians. The Nazis also created safe relation with the Vatican and Christians during Hitler was elected by liberals into becoming chancellor. To Christians, using the tactic of nativism Israel are god-given state and their birth-right, effectively erasing out the history of Palestinian existence on the land for the exact same time. Identitism is also seen commonly for white supremacists in North America and Europe to drive out people of color, by mystifying and rewriting the history of their colonialism and imperialism.\n\n#E - Imperialism\n\nThe tenet of every state's survival is to expand their power and control, to build imperialism and colonial power. No example are better than UK, US, USSR and China. Invading another state in the ruse of foreign aid and controlling the state's economy. This stands out the most with Israel using their economic power to influence politics in South Africa by supporting apartheid government, in Brazil to impeach Dilma Roussef, in India to oppress farmers by being a major investors in Monsanto and their seed's patents. But they did not stop at trade wars but expanding invasion against Syria, Lebanon and Iran to seize lands in the ruse of self defense.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Israel: Recognizing The Fascist State"}

I am a relative newcomer to anarchist theory myself so if you are an experienced member of the community I would be happy to make you a moderator. \n\nMy first post is a short clip featuring Dr. Adrian Raine, a neuroscientist and expert on violent crime. Raine argues that free will is a shakey concept when it comes to the issue of extreme, psychopathic violence. Personally I have a deep interest in preventing, predicting and otherwise reacting to the highest level of criminality in society. \n\nI am also interested in how we can prevent large scale corruption. Where the misdeeds of a serial killer might claim a handful of lives, the misdeeds of a pharmaceutical or energy lobbyist can claim thousands of lives. We can talk about middle and lower level crimes as well, such as theft and fraud, but I would like the main focus of the sub to be on higher level crimes. I think anarchist societies can overcome most of the less serious crimes by virtue of equality and mutual aid, it is the more serious crimes where I see issues. \n\nThank you all!","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Promoting a new subreddit, Anarchy Justice"}

Once you enter the doors, a woman yells at you to form a single line. Up ahead, you can see that single line joining a huge corral, rows upon rows of people moving very slowly toward an area with electronic kiosks. \n\nWhile you are waiting, that same woman starts yelling at the crowd to download an app from the Apple or Google store to expedite the process. She will be yelling at you to download this app for the next 30-40 minutes as you wait in line.

The app is sponsored by Boeing. \n\nIf you choose not to download the app, you will eventually make it to a kiosk. One per person. The kiosk is robotic and will automatically raise or lower to meet your height. After you scan your passport, it will shine a light in your face for a few seconds while it takes your picture. You then answer the usual customs questions. It prints out a receipt with your picture on it.

He shouts, \"Keep moving forward. Do not stop.\" As he stares at nobody. The level of anger is very unsettling.

In this passage he emphasizes the importance of keeping the weak segregated away from the strong and the \u201cnoble,\u201d lest the latter be infected by their slave morality:\n\n\n&gt; Away with this \"twisted world\"!

But that would require above everything that the healthy remain separated from the sick, protected even from the gaze of sick people, so that they don't confuse themselves with the ill.\u201d\n\n\nThis of course ignores the fact that there cannot be any conception of \u201cstrong\u201d without the conception of \u201cweak\u201d and that the strong are only strong by virtue of the fact that they are able to exercise their \u2018will to power\u2019 over the weak.  Without slaves to tend to them, the \u201cstrong\u201d would quickly perish.\n\nNow, there are certainly admirable aspects to Nietzsche\u2019s philosophy.  He also rails against the bourgeois \u201clast men\u201d of his day, the antiquarian historians whose foremost aim is revering the past rather than building a new and better future.  The ideal he envisions for man in Zarathustra is certainly interesting, but not if one must abandon compassion and care to reach it.  I know Nietzsche severed his ties to Wagner when he discovered the latter was a rabid anti-Semite, and while the future he envisions appears to be \u2018nobility\u2019 for all regardless of race or creed, it\u2019s hard not to see that this was a man who was very much a product of his society and that underpinning his ideas are some very unsavory beliefs about people and their motivations that are assumed as verities from the outset.\n\nWhat do you all think?","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"The appeal of Nietzsche"}

Well, it is first necessary to defeat the anarchists - I am only half-joking about that. It is essential that we ask why it is that neo-anarchist ideas are so dominant amongst young people, and especially undergraduates. The blunt answer is that, although anarchist tactics are the most ineffective in attempting to defeat capital, capital has destroyed all the tactics that were effective, leaving this rump to propagate itself within the movement. There is an uncomfortable synergy between the rhetoric of the \u2018big society\u2019 and a lot of the neo-anarchist ideas and concepts. For example, one of the things which is particularly pernicious about some of the dominant ideas within anarchism at the moment is their disengagement from the mainstream.\n\nThere is the idea, for instance, that the mainstream media is an inherently corrupt monolith. The point is that it is completely corrupt, but it is not a monolith. It is a terrain that is effectively controlled at present by neoliberals, who took the fight over the mainstream media very seriously, and consequently won that struggle.\n\nOne of the things which I am pushing for is media consciousness-raising with some younger people - for example, Channel 4 used to have hour-long programmes featuring a debate between three philosophers. Now Big brother takes up that slot. The slot once occupied by European Arts cinema is now taken by Location, location, location. If you want to look at the changes in British society, politically and culturally, over the last 30 years then there is no better example than Channel 4. \n\nWhy is that? Because Channel 4 emerged as a result of all sorts of struggles within the media for control of things like film, and people took that very seriously. Alongside the labour struggles of the 80s there were also cultural struggles. Both were defeated, but at the time it was by no means obvious that they would be. If you remember, the 80s were the time when there were moral panics about \u2018loony left\u2019 councils, and there was also a moral panic over Channel 4 with its politically correct lefties, who were supposedly taking over broadcasting.\n\nThat is part of what I mean by an alternative modernity - an alternative to the neoliberal \u2018modernity\u2019, which is actually just a return to the 19th century in many ways. But the idea that the mainstream culture is inherently coopted, and all we can do is withdraw from it, is deeply flawed.\n\nThe same is true about parliamentary politics. You should not pin all of your hopes on parliamentary politics, because that would be sad and ludicrous, but, at the same time, if it was pointless then you have to ask why the business class expends so many resources in subjugating parliament to its own interests.\n\nAgain, the neo-anarchist idea that the state is finished, that we do not need to participate in it at all, is deeply pernicious. It is not that parliamentary politics will achieve much on its own - the object lesson of what happens if you believe that to be the case was New Labour. Power without hegemony - that is effectively what New Labour was. But that is pointless. You cannot hope to achieve anything through an electoral machine alone. But it is hard to see how struggles can succeed without being part of an ensemble. We have to win back the idea that it is about winning the hegemonic struggle in society on different fronts at the same time.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Mark Fisher on Anarchism"}

I truly thought this party would be good for the local communities, good for the people. However, once I had truly become immersed in the party culture, the more I disliked it. The focus was never about really helping people, it was about gaining power. An unfair voting system led them to essentially endorse one of the major parties. I thought things would be better at the local level, in this \"party of parties\", but I saw more political-sneering, and whining about not being in power. When suggestions were brought up to actually engage the people you talk to, by asking them about their feelings on issues, and not just beg them for votes; they were genuinely blown away by the mere idea of this. One person even remarked about how it was a \"clever trick\". \n\nSo I'm done with this crap. I'm investing less time in party politics that affect nothing, and more into direct action, mutual aid and the improvement of my local neighborhood. \n\nHowever, I want to make a statement about this.

A cop pulls over right behind us, I\u2019m a bit tense at the moment but whatever I\u2019m just changing the tire... though I\u2019m hispanic my friend that was driving is hispanic but looks white so I was hoping that\u2019d be the first thing he notices (what a fcking sad reality). He comes over sees me doing it all by myself and though I\u2019d never calla a cop if he offers to help change the tire I\u2019m mot gonna say no, hey I just wanna get home and it\u2019s the evening. Nope, though he walks over and the only thing he asks is for my friends driver\u2019s license and insurance info, takes it, runs the stuff and since we\u2019re good he fucking drives away. Didn\u2019t ask if we\u2019re ok, didn\u2019t offer any help, that was it. I was fucking glad nothing else happened, but for fucks sake isn\u2019t serving part of their motto? But honestly I don\u2019t need his help I don\u2019t give a shit, but why would he just come and ask for the license insurance and then leave?\n\nWell, I\u2019ll tell you why. Two months prior, my friend (same) was driving  with her girlfriend who does not have a drivers license. The same tire is flat so they had to pull over and wait for her dad to pick them up. While they\u2019re waiting, a police officer pulls over and walks up to them while they\u2019re trying to figure out how to change the tire. Same thing, didn\u2019t ask if they\u2019re ok or not, or if they needed help... he just asked for insurance and license, turns out her license was suspended but she had no idea, so she got a $300 ticket and had to wait for someone to come and drive the car. \n\nAnyways that\u2019s the end of my rant. Remember that they\u2019re not there to help you, but to protect a system that will oppress you. Also, check your tires and learn how to change them if you don\u2019t know how to already. \n\nGood luck. ","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Friendly reminder that cops are not there to help you."}

{"author":"writerwiz","created_utc":1523221952,"num_comments":8,"score":1,"selftext":"It's both a necessity and an inevitability as the current world order is simply unsustainable. Although it seems as nothing is happening, every protest, dissenting opinion, and act of crime is rebellion. Everyone of these actions gets us just a bit closer. For every action has an equal and opposite reaction, so as long the current state of affairs causes people to suffer, people will rebel. The media will never reflect this reality and will always make things appear as the status quo is inescapable, but that has never been true. Every empire falls.\n\nI've noticed an overwhelming amount of apathy. I've made several attempts on several anarchist subreddits to spur people to action, but the response is rarely encouraging. The internet in its current state is being used as a great tool of distraction from serious issues, but it still has an immense revolutionary potential. It has made a United world with direct democracy of the masses a possibility. Just imagine what Marx, Kropotkin, Goldman, or any of the many other great propgandizers of our movements would do if they had access to such a tool.\n\nYet it seems as nothing is done. Perhaps there are countless other atomized individuals like myself trying to create change with a keyboard, and the algorithms that dictate the internet are just designed to dissuade that. Prioritize the interesting click bait over the thoughtful system analysis's, but you've read this. No algorithm could stop us if we all did something to this extent. Imagine if one percent of the followers of this subreddit consistently implored people on other subreddits to enlighten the world of the problems of our world and the already determined solutions. \n\nWe know how to deal with organization of the masses in non exploitative ways, we know the root causes of mass suffering, we know what's up. As someone who carries this understanding we have a certain responsibility to enlighten those around us. In person is the best way to do so, but no one can talk to the other seven billion people on earth. If we want anarchism to be a reality, then we must make it so. We must use every tool available and spread this shit like the plague. Just like religions and movies and memes have gone viral and changed what people discuss, so can anarchism. It's happened before.\n\nKropotkin has a great essay titled \"The Spirit of Revolt\" where he details many different forms of propaganda and their varying effectivenesses. Pamphlets, songs, and posters were the big ones back then, but now we have so much more. We have what was available then, being pamphlets, newspapers, books, posters, music, word of mouth, games, but now we have the digital realm of the internet. We have forums and blogs, videos and video games. All of these effect what we think about, this post is propaganda. Every word you read is a thought I've put in your head. Right now the mainstream media dominates this realm. The money is controlled by the powerful and they use it to control what content is produced and so none of it invites true rebellion and systemic change.\nBut we can change that. We can make all those things. Every art we create will inspire others to do the same. The best thing of all is the meme. Short, simple, and to the point. Whole political thesis's can't be explained with a picture and a caption.\n\nWe are members of the masses, it's up to us to bring about revolution. Help will not come from above, it must come from within. So please for the love of life on earth, can we please use this incredible tool of communication for mass change? Can we finally start the world revolution? Can we please organize within this site and create strategies that any random average person can use to make positive change in their life?\n\nIf interested, please comment, please post things like this, please push for improvement. If anyone is interested in further discussion of these issues, my dm is open.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"The Revolution"}

{"author":"Benjbear","created_utc":1523230657,"num_comments":10,"score":59,"selftext":"Another Day, Another Broken Door: The Tower's Statement on Recent Events\n\nEarly Friday morning, Hamilton police raided a home associated with some of those involved with organizing The Hamilton Anarchist Bookfair. The door was kicked in, a flash grenade was thrown into the house, and a full swat team entered. With their assault rifles drawn, the swat team proceeded to pull everyone out of bed some of whom were naked, and with one exception, put everyone in handcuffs. Three people were detained and one person arrested. Cedar, a member of The Tower Collective and our cherished friend, was arrested, taken away, and currently remains in custody.\n\nThose who weren\u2019t arrested were forced to wait outside for close to five hours, while cops \u201csearched\u201d the home. Similar to the fascists who attacked The Tower last month, the police thoroughly trashed the space and even messed with the bookshelves. All three floors of the house were ripped apart and many things were damaged, including a collection of framed feminist postcards that were broken into several pieces and thrown into the bathroom toilet. Police are misogynist pigs, plain and simple, without exception. A long list of items were seized, including all electronics (phones, computers, cameras, external hard-drives etc.), books, posters, zines, and a pretty random assortment of documents (academic journal articles, translated texts from a book project, hand written notes, event programs, pamphlets etc.).\n\nIn terms of the arrest, Cedar is facing conspiracy charges in relation to the so-called \u201cLocke St. Riot\u201d. We have no desire to engage with the politics of innocence. The concept of innocence and its flipside criminality obscure more than illuminate \u2013 no one is innocent and the most \u201ccriminal\u201d amongst us run the economy and government. Beyond that, these notions perpetuate the logic of a colonial legal system rooted in white supremacy. That said, it is worth noting that conspiracy charges are notoriously dubious and flimsy, and have a legacy of being used as a tool of political persecution. They are an act of desperation intended to cast a wide net and scare people. Such charges are *not* a matter of engaging in a particular activity, but rather a matter of possibly encouraging a particular activity.\n\nThe Tower is an openly anarchist project that from its inception has promoted ideals of mutual aid and solidarity, equality, and community autonomy, as well as direct action, class war, and fighting back. Our politics have always included *both* gardens and riots. We want to see people building beautiful alternatives of liberation, just as much as we want to see people attacking structures of domination. Nothing about this is going to change, and despite recent challenges, our project will continue to push these ideas. We still have no tears for Locke St. and we remain unapologetically supportive of the activities that took place last month. It's actions like these that can impel conversations that no one wants to have (in this case, intensifying gentrification throughout the city), and we see this as positive.\n\nAs things continue to unfold, it is important for people to remember that it is never okay to cooperate with the police \u2013 do not talk to them and do not share any information (however big or small) with them. This isn't a question of agreeing or disagreeing with particular tactics, but of refusing to take actions that help facilitate state violence and repression. Aside from discussions about Locke St., local media has been dominated by stories of police corruption, misconduct, brutality, and most recently murder. Less than a week ago, the Hamilton police shot and killed Quinn MacDougall, an unarmed nineteen-year-old who had called 911 in distress looking for help. Cops are not and will never be our allies. We gain safety and strength by sticking together and staying silent.\n\n(https://www.facebook.com/thetowerhamilton/posts/2137593919601024)","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Police raid The Tower - Hamilton's Anarchist Social Space"}

Robert H. Barrow, USMC\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat does revolution mean in America, 2018? Among Merriam-Webster\u2019s definitions of \u201crevolution\u201d are:\n\n&gt;b : a fundamental change in political organization; especially : the overthrow or renunciation of one government or ruler and the substitution of another by the governed\n\nand\n\n&gt;c : activity or movement designed to effect fundamental changes in the socioeconomic situation\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWith respect to revolution, we cannot understand the political environment of the US in 2018 without going back to the last upsurge in left-wing revolutionary activity, from approximately 1968 to 1980. This is because much of the current security environment was shaped by the uprisings of the late 1960s and the armed struggle groups borne of that era. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe late 1960s, as most people know, were a time of great social upheaval. From the Civil Rights Movement to the Vietnam War opposition, as Hunter S. Thompson wrote in *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas*,\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;My central memory of that time seems to hang on one or five or maybe forty nights\u2014or very early mornings\u2014when I left the Fillmore half-crazy and, instead of going home, aimed the big 650 Lightning across the Bay Bridge at a hundred miles an hour wearing L. L. Bean shorts and a Butte sheepherder's jacket . . . booming through the Treasure Island tunnel at the lights of Oakland and Berkeley and Richmond, not quite sure which turn-off to take when I got to the other end (always stalling at the toll-gate, too twisted to find neutral while I fumbled for change) . . . but being absolutely certain that no matter which way I went I would come to a place where people were just as high and wild as I was: No doubt at all about that. . . .\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn 1969, the war in Vietnam was still ongoing and ethnic minorities still faced tremendous discrimination. Groups like the  Black Panther Party, [Brown Berets](https://www.vibe.com/2016/02/formation-the-little-known-history-of-the-brown-berets/), the [American Indian Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Movement), [Young Lords](https://libcom.org/library/palante-brief-history-young-lords) and the [Red Guard Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Guard_Party) experienced rapid growth, as people of color sought increasingly openly  militant and armed responses to white supremacy. Robert F. Williams and Deacons of Defense had in the early 1960s  advocated open armed-self defense, but it had not caught on as a national movement. While the civil rights organizers of SNCC in the South had utilized armed self defense, they were extremely low key and it would not become public knowledge until [decades later](https://youtu.be/WPkeSbr3H0w).  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt the same time as people of color were openly arming themselves for self-defense, there was a faction of the anti-war movement that had become increasingly frustrated by the inability of the non-violent protest movement to put an end to US military involvement in Vietnam. The debate over how to stop the war in Vietnam boiled over in one of the largest student activist groups in the US, the [Students for a Democratic Society](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-was-protest-group-students-democratic-society-five-questions-answered-180963138/). Known by the acronym SDS, it had as many as 100,000 members at its peak. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn June of 1969, a group who eventually became known as the [Weather Underground] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground) called for a [socialist revolution](https://archive.org/stream/YouDontNeedAWeathermanToKnowWhichWayTheWindBlows_925/weather_djvu.txt) in the United States driven by a clandestine revolutionary party. Effectively, the Weathermen dissolved SDS, as they began their policy of secret armed struggle against the United States. The Weatherman were heavily influenced by revolutions in the Third World, and like the [Black Panthers](https://digitalcommons.iwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1090&amp;context=constructing), they were strongly influenced by the Chinese Revolution and the Maoist tradition. The Maoist analysis of pre-revolutionary China held that China was exploited  by Europe, the US, and Japan, via foreign companies, military occupation and compliant local elites. The Weather Underground considered Black people to make up an internal colony of the United States, with the US government as an occupying imperial power. Under this analysis, Black people made up the revolutionary vanguard in the United States, as the most oppressed class. Weather was a mostly white, young organization, and so  committed itself to supporting the Black vanguard. The idea was that young white people were less attached to the system and were also under the threat of military service in Vietnam, and thus would be receptive to the message of socialist revolution. They believed that they could \u201cbring the war home\u201d and make the US into a battleground in support of  an international socialist revolution. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe Weather Underground went on to stage numerous bombings and bank robberies during the [1970s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Weatherman_actions). A number of other explicitly revolutionary clandestine armed struggle groups emerged in the 1970s like Venceremos, the Black Liberation Army, and the [Chicano Liberation Front](http://www.notesfromaztlan.com/2014/04/16/the-chicano-liberation-front-1971/) .  [Venceremos](http://www.paloaltohistory.org/venceremos.php), a Maoist organization led by Stanford Professor H. Bruce Franklin that engaged in street skirmishes with police and eventually staged a prison break before dissolving. The [Black Liberation Army](https://newafrikan77.wordpress.com/2018/01/16/the-b-l-a-black-liberation-army-1970s-to-1980s-history/), was an offshoot of the Panthers. The BLA robbed banks, bombed buildings, assassinated police officers and drug dealers. One of its most famous members was [Assata Shakur](https://www.essence.com/news/assata-shakur-politicians-call-return-from-cuba-facts), I kid you not ,the godmother of Tupac Shakur. The [Chicano Liberation Front](http://www.notesfromaztlan.com/2014/04/16/the-chicano-liberation-front-1971/) set off bombs at  \"banks, chain stores, government buildings, police cars\u201d in the Los Angeles area during the early 1970s. It was not only in the US that groups engaged in armed struggle against capitalism. Groups like  the [Japanese Red Army](http://www.exile.ru/articles/detail.php?ARTICLE_ID=7993&amp;IBLOCK_ID=35), the German [Baader-Meinhoff Faction](https://www.thelocal.de/20170905/10-things-you-ought-to-know-about-the-raf-terrorist-organization-baader-meinhof), and the [Provisional Irish Republican Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army) emerged in the 1970s. Many, if not most, of these groups drew their inspiration from the Marxist-Leninist tradition. They robbed banks to finance their operations and to support life in the underground. It was hard to hold  a day job and be a clandestine insurgent at the same time. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe Vietnam War was tremendously unpopular by the end of the 1960s, especially with young people in the USA, and combined with the despair created by assassinations of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, meant that the tacit support for radical action was strong. Indeed, the military itself was coming apart under the stresses of the war and white supremacy.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;In 1968, combined Vietnam AWOLs and desertions reached over 150 per thousand soldiers. About 100 Black deserters established \u201cSoul Alley\u201d in a Saigon neighborhood near Ton San Nhut Airport. Fully armed Black and white troops faced off at China Beach, Danang.\n[Link](http://www.blackcommentator.com/49/49_street.html)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHundreds of US Army officers were killed by their own troops, as morale collapsed and soldiers rebelled against the system, including members of Army intelligence like [Captain Christopher Pyle](https://www.democracynow.org/2009/7/29/pyle).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne can see that in such an environment, some might think that armed struggle against the US government might have a chance of success. But the American empire was not ready to get pushed offstage yet. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n \nThe US government had already started an organized clandestine campaign against the left in 1967 with COINTELPRO. Led by the FBI, the campaign attempted to sow division among the left by turning groups against each other through the use of informants, agents, and anonymous letters to organizers to stir up drama.  This was done to make sure that multi-racial coalitions could not gain traction. The FBI wasn\u2019t alone in targeting the left clandestinely. The [Army](https://theamericanscholar.org/spies-among-us/#), Navy, and CIA all had domestic programs aimed at the left, as did state and local law enforcement. Most notable of the state programs was the [Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission](http://www.upress.state.ms.us/books/496) which was essentially a state secret police dedicated to enforcing the rule of white supremacy in Mississippi. Almost all of these programs justified themselves on the basis of fighting \u2018\u2019communist infiltration\u201d and \u201coutside agitators,\u201d as if to say that there were no real problems of injustice in the US, just \u201cforeigners\u201d causing problems where before there was peace. Apparently the security services believed that no one born in the US could actually believe that segregation, white supremacy, and the war in Vietnam were wrong unless they were mislead by \u201coutside agitators.\u201d \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThings really turned up in the early 1970s as the various socialist armed struggle groups launched their campaigns. Previously, police had received reinforcements from National Guard or regular Army formations to contain rioting/uprisings in major cities. In some cases this meant deploying tanks on the streets. After 1970 this became increasingly untenable, when National Guard soldiers on riot control duty fired on a crowd of unarmed students at Kent State, killing 4. Using soldiers against rioters was an old American practice. Federal troops and state militias put down [draft riots in the [Civil War era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_draft_riots), and state governors routinely used the National Guard as strikebreakers against labor uprisings. But the evolving tactics of uprisings in the 1960s took inspiration from the Cuban and Chinese revolutions, and adopted hit-and-fade guerrilla tactics. It simply took too long to call out a military unit to deal with such attacks. Thus in the late 1960s, the Los Angeles police department had already started its first [Special Weapons and Tactics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT) units, to cope with sniper attacks during uprisings. When the various armed struggle groups began operating in the US, LAPD SWAT expanded to a full time operation, and other cities across the nation follow.  As the 1970s drew on, innovations in combat shooting techniques, team tactics, and equipment proliferated, much of which was informed by the practical competition shooting community. Practical pistol shooting had undergone tremendous development in Southern California, as a result of the community around [Jeff Cooper](https://www.americanrifleman.org/articles/2015/3/26/throwback-thursday-jeff-cooper/). Cooper was the father of modern combat handgun technique, and he did his initial research and development in Big Bear, California, not that far from LA. SWAT units built out sniper, [dynamic entry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9BPHQH-lIg), and surveillance skills, with a lot of cross pollination between SWAT and elite military units. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe late 1960s also marked a new veneration of police by the white majority. No more of the old labor battles where cops and strikers fought it out, now, student protesters would be hit with felony charges for assaulting a police officer. While police worship might seem to be something that has always been present in American life, that is untrue. For example, assault on a police officer was not a felony in California until [around 1966](http://www.cwmorse.org/metropoly-the-story-of-oakland-california/).\n\n&gt;ABSOLUTELY THE BIGGEST DAY in Assemblyman Don Mulford\u2019s life was on the seventh day of the Watts riots when the telephone rang in his Oakland office. The call was long distance; Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker was on the line, Parker invited Mulford to fly down and ride with the police through the riot-torn area the next day, an invitation Mulford accepted with alacrity. It is not every week that the police chief of one of the nation\u2019s biggest cities asks you, in person, to ride around with him and watch his town burn down. This was just Chief Parker\u2019s way or expressing his appreciation for Mulford\u2019s efforts in the California State Legislature on behalf of policemen. For instance, Mulford is the author of a new law which makes it a felony to assault a policeman in California. He has always been strong on law and order. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn California, a Western state with historically lax gun laws, the state legislature had already banned open carry of loaded firearms in 1967, after the Black Panthers had marched on Sacramento open carrying long guns. The author of the bill? None other than Don Mulford. Now, the big city regimes in California began to decisively turn in favor of gun control as uprisings became routine. It became a firm Democratic Party litmus test to weed out radicals from the party, who might be sympathetic to the armed militants. In 1968 the Democrats, under President Lyndon B. Johnson pushed the Gun Control Act into law, which created the structure of licensed federal firearms dealers we know today. It also made an attempt to make inexpensive handguns imported from overseas illegal \u2014 the so-called \u201cSaturday Night Specials.\u201d  In effect, the Democrats decided that inexpensive firearms for self protection should not exist. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlongside the intensification of police tactics came a new legal enforcement regime designed to target the left on all levels. After ascending the presidency, Richard Nixon launched the War on Drugs in 1971, which one of his advisors [later admitted](https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/23/politics/john-ehrlichman-richard-nixon-drug-war-blacks-hippie/index.html) was designed to target Black people and the left. \nSaid the advisor:\n&gt;We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities,\" Ehrlichman said. \"We could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\"\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nDrugs were also a potential source of income for insurgent groups, then as now. Given that they had already committed to clandestine, illegal operations, they had the infrastructure to move drugs for cash. If you talk to older folks from the anti-war/left movements, you\u2019ll eventually hear stories of how folks sometimes raised money by selling cannabis. Nixon\u2019s law and order efforts were bolstered by liberals, who went all in for mandatory minimum sentences and the \u201crule of law,\u201d the technocratic and politer version of Nixon\u2019s \u201claw and order.\u201d Naomi Murakawa has [written about](https://www.thenation.com/article/how-white-liberals-used-civil-rights-create-more-prisons/) this:\n&gt;the fundamental thesis of Murakawa\u2019s book: legal civil rights and the American carceral state are built on the same conceptions of race, the state and their relationship. As liberals believe that racism is first and foremost a question of individual bias, they imagine racism can be overcome by removing the discretion of (potentially racist) individuals within government through a set of well-crafted laws and rules.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn 1973 came a real death blow to the clandestine revolutionaries \u2014 in fact, to American leftists of all sorts, when Nixon ended compulsory military service. In one sense, this was a great victory for the youth movement because it meant young men no longer had to go to war in Vietnam. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut at the same time, in one swoop Nixon cut the legs out from under the left mass movements. The young white people that the Weather Underground had been counting on suddenly had a lot of options. After all, the economy was still pretty strong; a white man didn\u2019t need to even have a college degree to land a decent paying job. The sexual revolution was going all out \u2014 just talk to anyone who was a teenager in the early 1970s and they\u2019ll tell you how much sex they had. Right then and there, the Weather Underground\u2019s recruiting pipeline dried up, because young white kids were no longer worried about being drafted to fight a war in Southeast Asia. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs to people of color, well,  the power structure\u2019s response was more than just the iron first of the security services. In addition to the end of compulsory military service, communities of color suddenly had opportunities in the form of affirmative action jobs and education programs. At first, most of these were concentrated in the public sector. But quickly, private companies joined in on the diversity push as well. Effectively, this meant that young militants had the ability to get a subsidized education since public universities in many places were still free or minimal cost. Those who had completed college had a chance at a stable job in the public sector, or maybe at a government contractor that had to show commitment to equal opportunity in order to get government contracts. At a time when the security services were regularly assassinating leftist militants, a good government job provided an appealing out from an uncertain life of armed struggle. People who might otherwise have become effective leaders in the underground instead chose to work within the system that seemed to offer a pathway for advancement. What\u2019s more, elite American institutions verbally repudiated the history of segregation, and by 1983, Martin Luther King Day became an official holiday, in which the MLK of \u201cI have a dream\u201d was the focus, and \u201c[Beyond Vietnam\u201d](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/beyond-vietnam) was studiously ignored.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor those who had not made up their mind in the reform versus revolution debate, the opening of education and jobs to people of color put a strong weight into the reform column. Perhaps the United States\u2019 history of white supremacy could be put to rest through equal opportunity programs and \u201cblack faces in high places.\u201d \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs the 1970s drew to a close, the combination of the end of the draft, equal opportunity programs, and the counterinsurgency masked as the war on drugs strangled the various armed struggle groups by  draining the [sea](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/mao_zedong_138236) of recruits and  hunting militants. There was another factor in the failure of the armed struggle groups. Unlike revolutionaries in China and Cuba, the Americans had no refuge or guerrilla base from which to launch attacks and rest between missions. In some revolutionary circles, the American inner cities were viewed as  de facto colonized area that ethnic minorities could wrest from the white power structure and use as sanctuaries. This did happen to some extent during the 1970s and 1980s. However, unlike the Chinese and Cuban revolutionary bases, inner cities did not offer the possibility of subsistence agriculture. Which is to say, people who lived in the inner cities could not raise their own food and thus refuse most interaction with the capitalist system. Instead, inner city residents had to obtain food either from government food programs (which were increasingly attacked under the Reagan administration), steal it, or purchase it with dollars. To get those dollars they either had to enter the capitalist wage system, or engage in illegal activity. Moreover, where the Cuban and Chinese revolutionary bases were remote and required government forces to traverse significant distances to even engage in battles, inner city neighborhoods by definition are in the heart of capital\u2019s control zones. Thus, the ability of inner city residents to exercise significant autonomy from the power structure were limited spatially as well as by available food resources. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe international militants of the Baader-Meinhof and Japanese Red Army factions were also similarly impaired. While they often trained in Lebanon in the camps controlled Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, neither group had a mass base in their home countries, as Japan and Germany both experienced incredibly economic growth in the 1970s.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne group that survived the 1970s and continued to fight on through the 1980s was the Provisional IRA, which had widespread popular support in Northern Ireland among Catholics. Unlike the American armed struggle groups, the PIRA also had a nearby refuge, the Republic of Ireland, right across the porous southern border of Northern Ireland. The PIRA also obtained significant support from Irish-Americans, both money and weapons. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nUnlike the PIRA, throughout the 1980s, the remaining American leftist armed struggle groups dropped off the map one by one. Many participants were captured or killed in actions, some fled the US, and some went into hiding, trying to live \u2018normal\u2019 lives and gave up on armed struggle against the American government. As the Soviet Union and its economic block collapsed, and China forswore supporting overseas revolutionaries, it seemed like the era of armed insurgency inside the United States was over. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBut in wide open spaces of the American West and Midwest, something was brewing. High interest rates set by the Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker triggered a [farm crisis](http://www.iptv.org/mtom/classroom/module/13999/farm-crisis) in the early 1980s. The resulting collapse struck rural America hard.\n&gt;Rural communities that once bustled with activity began to look more like ghost towns. Thousands of farm families defaulted on their loans and were forced off the land. Those who couldn't find work in nearby towns pulled up stakes in droves, and the mass exodus resulted in fewer jobs for those who stayed. Businesses and factories shut down-many never to reopen. Stores on Main Street were closed and scores of banks failed. The rapidly declining population resulted in abandoned farmhouses, diminished government services and widespread school consolidations. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the years after 1968, the Democratic Party moved to eventually embrace neoliberal economic principles. They worked hard to purge any other way of thinking, and began to embrace Margaret Thatcher\u2019s slogan, \u201cthere is no alternative.\u201d Thus, they had no significant policy response to the farm crisis.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJust as the material base of many white rural communities was coming under attack, the coastal Democrats in the Northeast and California had successfully put down the leftist insurgencies with a combination of elevating some ethnic minorities into the elite, and a program of strict controls over firearms. Both of these initiatives became core to the national Democratic party platform, and both struck at the heart of rural white identity. In time, as the economic situation in the interior of the United States deteriorated, a new group of insurgents arose in the early 1990s. These men wanted a fundamental change in government to turn the clock back to 1789. Unlike the insurgents of the left, the [militia movement](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/26/ruby-ridge-1992-modern-american-militia-charlottesville) that emerged after 1992 had significant support inside the security services. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn Part II, I will analyze the rise of the right wing militia movement in the US, and what it means for revolution today. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n","subreddit":"SocialistRA","title":"This is How To Think About Revolution in 2018 (Part I)""num_comments":0,"score":8,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"This is How To Think About Revolution in 2018 (Part I)"}

It\u2019s relatively casual, though we don't shy away from serious discussion, and it's a great place for you to talk about your issues if you're a woman. It's a safe, friendly place to discuss current events, news, health issues, to rant about the things you experience, to share stories you think are worthwhile, and to chat about all kinds of topics relevant to women. This doesn't mean men are unwelcome, absolutely not. Men are most welcome, just keep in mind that it is a sub for women so you are encouraged to listen first, and when posting make sure that what you are posting is relevant to women's struggles. A good guide would be to look over the existing threads to gauge the tone and type of the content that's already been approved and use your best judgement.\n\n\nQuick note - FT is not a sub just for Femmes. The creator took the name as the direct translation of the French \u2018Woman\u2019, rather than the term for feminine lifestyle as we use it today. So all women are welcome, cis, lesbian, trans, feminine, butch, and the whole rainbow of beautiful human expression.\n\n\nFor those of you already subscribed, but are infrequent users, we have a few small updates: we limit link-posts, whether they are to articles off-site or cross-posted from other subs, to two per person per day. This is to prevent /r/FemmeThoughts from becoming an article dumping ground and we insist that every posted article or website be accompanied by a comment expressing your thoughts, criticisms, analysis or impressions, and/or why you thought to share it with us.\n\n\nWe also follow accessibility guidelines, and so we insist that media in the form of pictures be described in a text comment, and videos be accompanied by a transcript, unless the video itself contains a transcript or has proper closed captioning within.\n\n\nFor those of you who are new, we encourage all comrades who want to engage with women\u2019s issues, who wish to read, participate and understand, to join us. We want to attract a different perspective to the usual bourgeois feminist one. So we need you, our proletarian, Anarcha-Feminists who want to discuss women\u2019s issues in a safe, friendly space (where reactionaries are banned on sight), to come and contribute.\n\n\nIn addition to FemmeThoughts, as I mentioned above, we also have r/FemmeThoughtsFeminism for serious, statistical, and theoretical content, and r/AskFemmeThoughts which serves as our primary place for learns. This is the FT Trifecta, and of course we also encourage you to subscribe to these and post relevant threads, or questions, as appropriate. The latter two are a bit quiet but they are checked often and are never neglected.\n\n\nThe mods of FT are here for you, of course, to support and stand beside you as comrades in the eternal struggle against white supremacist, capitalist patriarchy, for as long as one of us is not free, none of us are free!","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Hello comrades!With approval from our amazing mods here and the mods from the following subs, I'm here to invite you to /r/FemmeThoughts and engage in the intersectional struggle for the liberation of all oppressed peoples!"}

{"author":"HeyThereImApollo","created_utc":1523824448,"num_comments":11,"score":5,"selftext":"I have recently been getting into a lot of debates regarding Ayn Rand's Objectivism, as I have many friends who are right wing libertarians. While I don't nearly despise them as much as most libertarian socialists, after a while it gets sickening hearing the platitudes on how Objectivism explains the whole of human nature, \"Greed is good,\" and how it gives us an objective moral standard (the maintenance of one's own life). I am asking this in r/anarchism because I thought this was the most likely place I'd run into someone who shares my agitation; I was hoping I could receive some help in devising a brief outline for an essay highlighting Objectivism's flaws. My thesis is that Objectivism is not Objective. To back it, I wanted to cover a select few points, those being the underlying assumptions and assertions Ayn Rand makes in her book *The Virtue of Selfishness*:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* *All* living entities hold the maintenance of one's own life as the ultimate standard of value, to which all lesser goals are the means (although this is not purposive as much as it is a description of what occurs);\n\n* Because all living entities hold the maintenance of one's own life as the ultimate standard of value, this value is prescriptive as well as descriptive (by this I mean that it describes what is and ought to be);\n\n* Man's conscious is volitional. Man relies on conceptual values, although these are not automatically obtained; it requires critical thinking;\n\n\nI have already begun my essay and currently have to an extent attempted to refute the first and second points; I do not know if refuting the third is necessary. That being said, my first and second refutations need more backing. This is my essay so far:\n\n\nI should note that I agree with most of Rand's conclusions; it is the assumptions she outlines in the beginning of The Virtue of Selfishness I take issue with. She assumes intention behind the birth of man, and this she uses as the base of her philosophy: \"[T]he functions of all living organisms . . . are actions generated by the organism itself and directed to a single goal: the maintenance of the organism's life.\" (Virtue of Selfishness, pp. 16-17) Now, this does not mean she believes there is a conscious mind in every organism consistently analyzing its situation with a purpose solely to remain alive. In fact directly afterwards she protests against this notion, stating on page 17 that\n\n\n&gt; the term 'goal-directed' is not to be taken to mean 'purposive' (a concept applicable only to the actions of a consciousness) and is not to imply the existence of any teleological principle operating in insentient nature. . . . I use the term 'goal directed' in this context, to designate the fact that the automatic functions of living organisms are actions whose nature is such that they result in the preservation of an organism's life.\n\n\nI applaud her for making this distinction; without it her following arguments would have no backbone. However, the distinction she makes brings up a different issue. She attempts then to establish the preservation of an organism's life as its \"ultimate value . . . that final goal or end to which all lesser goals are the means.\" (p. 17) In essence all \"that furthers its life is the good, that which threatens it is evil.\" (p. 17) Doing so requires a., there to be a conscious intention to pursue the value, and b., the value to be universally sought after by all those whom it supposedly applies to.\n\nThe first problem is that Rand's statement is purely descriptive, as while a turkey for example might act in a manner that self-preserves, this by no means creates an objective standard of value. She might've had a point if she said this value only applied to humans, as clearly adults are capable of conscious reasoning, and thus are capable of living by values.\n\nBut what of children, particularly newborns? Have they yet a conscious, a capability to hold to life as a standard of value? After all, a child fresh out of the womb is incapable of grasping the importance of life. While they try to preserve their well-being, this isn't coming from an intellectual place; it is pure instinct that a baby nurses among other things. They posses\n\n\n&gt; only the faculty of sensation. . . . produced by the automatic reaction of a sense organ to stimulus from the outside world; it lasts for the duration of the immediate moment, as long as the stimulus lasts and no longer. Sensations are an automatic response, an automatic form of knowledge. . . . An organism that possesses only the of sensation is guided by the pleasure-pain mechanism of its body, that is: by an automatic knowledge and an automatic code of values. Its life is the standard of value directing its actions. (pp. 19-20)\n\n\nAyn Rand would have us believe this is in fact a form of consciousness, although limited in comparison with that of an adult\u2014she claims this is the consciousness of animals\u2014but we run into the same problem: as while a turkey for example might act in a manner that self-preserves, this by no means creates an objective standard of value. The conclusion to thereby be made is that the universal value of life only applies to humans whose brains have developed to a point of critical reasoning.

Throughout my education in philosophy--which includes a Bachelor's and Master's degree--I found myself regularly returning to thinkers who addressed the clear and present absence of a \"natural ontology,\" thinkers such as Kierkegaard, Chestov, and Jaspers. \n\nI first encountered the notion of the Absurd in Albert Camus' 1942 essay [*The Myth of Sisyphus*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_Sisyphus). \n\n[The Absurd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism#Albert_Camus) is understood by Camus to refer to the fundamental conflict between what we human beings naturally seek in the universe and what we find in the universe. The Absurd is a confrontation, an opposition, a conflict, or a \"divorce\" between two ideals: On the one hand, we have man's desire for significance, meaning and clarity; On the other hand, we're faced with the formless chaos of an uncaring universe. \n\nAs such, the Absurd exists neither in man nor in the universe, but in the confrontation between the two. We are only faced with the Absurd when we take both our need for answers and the world's silence together. Recognition of the Absurd is perhaps the central dilemma in the philosophical inquiry of Existentialism. \n\nAnd while phenomenologists, [such as Husserl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Husserl#Meaning_and_object), attempt to escape from the contradiction of the Absurd, Camus emphatically insists that we must face it. This paradox affects all humankind equally, and should merit our undivided attention and sincere efforts. \n\nIn his attempt to approximate a \"solution\" for the Absurd, Camus elaborates three options over the course of *The Myth of Sisyphus*:\n\n1. **Suicide**: Camus notes that not only does suicide compound the absurdity, it acts as an implicit confession that life is not worth living. Additionally, he declares that suicide is of little use to us, as there can be no more meaning in death than in life.  \n2. **Faith in God**: In the face of the Absurd, other authors propose a flight towards religious doctrine. Chestov asserts that the Absurd *is* God, suggesting that we need God only to help us deal with the impossible and incomprehensible. Kierkegaard is famous for making the \"Leap of Faith\" into God, where he identifies the irrational with faith and with God. However, Camus retorts that this blind acceptance of supposed, yet elusive high meaning is akin to \"philosophical suicide,\" or abdicating one's will in exchange for an existential analgesic. \n3. **Revolt**: Finally, Camus proposes that the only way to reconcile with the Absurd is to live in defiance of it. Camus' Absurdist Hero lives a fulfilling life, despite his awareness that he is a reasonable man condemned to live a short time in an unreasonable world. The Absurdist Hero may choose to create meaning, but he must always maintain an ironic distance from his arbitrary meaning. Always, the conflict between our desire and reality is present-most in the mind of the Absurdist Hero, and so he lives, defiantly content, in a state of perpetual conflict. \n\nCamus follows Descartes' example in doubting every proposition that he cannot know with certainty, but unlike Descartes, Camus does not attempt to impose any new metaphysical order, but forces himself to find contentment in uncertainty. \n\nProvided you agree with the axioms from which Camus operates (which are largely allegorical), it becomes clear that his synthesis of a \"solution\" is cogent, realistic, and most likely practicable in our individual lives. After all, if life offers no inherent meaning, what choices lie beyond suicide, religion, and revolution? \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#**THE NEW EXISTENTIAL DILEMMA**\n\nArmed and equipped with some conceptual background, I invite you to explore and discuss a philosophical inquiry of my own, which I will refer to as **The *New* Existential Dilemma**! \n\nHumanity shall always be plagued by \"*cosmic existential angst*\" (the search for meaning in an uncaring universe). However, I rerr that we have and we will increasingly fall victim to what I'll call \"*terrestrial existential angst* (the search for meaning in a collapsing world). \n\nThis new angst springs from yet another paradox, similar to that of Sisyphus. On the one hand, we have man's desire to live and survive, and on the other, we have the growing likelihood of civilizational self-destruction. \n\nAs human beings, the instinct to survive is programmed into us. Our brains are designed to minimize risks, analyze threats, and conceptualize solutions in order to maximize our survival, and the survival of our offspring. But what utility are these talents in the context of systemic collapse? How do we reconcile our will to survive with the incipient collapse of systems on which our survival depends? \n\nIt's no secret that the future of our modern post-industrial, hyper-capitalist global system is in question. \n\nWhereas prior generations only had to contend with one existentially-threatening problem at a time, our current global society is attempting to negociate dozens of potentially-world-ending problems*, all at once. \n\n- Anthropogenic climate change\n- Global thermonuclear war\n- Deforestation\n- Ocean acidification\n- Anti-biotic-resistant disease\n- Peak oil and resource over-exploitation \n- Rising sea levels\n- An ongoing extinction event\n\nWith time, this list of transnational, eschatological challenges will most probably grow, both in size and in severity, until of course the moment of complete collapse (whether it's a thermonuclear war, or a complete rupture of the global supply chain). By all present accounting, omitting any scientific miracles in the coming decades, the human race appears to be on a trajectory which will inevitably end in it's demise. \n\nWe will not pass through the [Great Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter). This planet will be our collective grave, and the funeral oration is already beginning.  \n\n(*If you remain convinced that human civilization is due for collapse, for the sake of this exercise, please assume the affirmative*). \n\nIn a manner similar to Camus' Absurd Man, those of us living in the early- to mid-21st century are faced with three options in order to reconcile the absurdity which emerges when foiling our genetic programming (survival at all costs) with the reality of life on Earth in 20XX (survival is in question): \n\n\n1. **Suicide**: The same parameters exist here as in Camus' original paradox. Suicide cannot be a solution, for obvious reasons.  \n2. **Nihilism/Epicureanism**: This is the mode in which most people find themselves operating, naturally and without conscious thought. As the very notion of \"future,\" on a socio-systematic level, has been called into question, all moral presuppositions and dictates must be throw out. If your children are unlikely to be born, let alone thrive, in the period between 2020-2070, then why should you devote yourself to conventionally-virtuous human endeavours? The calculus of ontology has been upset: Our genetic programming, religious doctrines, and moral frameworks no longer seem relevant. And without a relevant framework by which to judge actions, people will naturally pursue drugs, sex, video games, and any other method of superficial self-gratification. The majority of my colleagues and friends would fall under this category. \n3. **Revolution**: Arm and organize yourselves in order to destroy the systemic forces (capitalism, consumerism, petroleum products, etc.) which are causing human civilization to self-destruct. Blow up garment factories, kidnap oil executives, and overthrow governments in order to install a sustainable political and social order. \n\nAre these valid choices? If not, what other choices could one pursue, in light of our present circumstances? \n\nAnd if you agree with my conception of choices, what option are *you* presently pursuing, consciously or subconsciously? \n\n--- \n[*Disclaimer: Whenever I use the expression \"world-ending,\" I'm being somewhat hyperbolic. Any civilizational collapse that occurs at this point, will (almost) certainly leave segments of Earth's population temporarily unharmed. However, bereft of readily-available resources, expertise or infrastructure, it is highly unlikely that any survivors of the assumed global collapse will ever reach the same heights as their forbearers. So if the modern, global industrial system collapses... there will be survivors, but they won't last long, and they certainly won't go onto conquer the solar system or the galaxy*]\n\n---\n\n[*I wrote and submitted a similar inquiry, three years ago, on /r/philosophy. In view of current events, however, it seemed appropriate to update, reformulate, and repost my questions!*]\n\n---\n**TL;DR: Our post-industrial, late-stage capitalist global civilization is collapsing. How do we reconcile this reality with our inherent will to survive?** ","subreddit":"philosophy","title":"The New Existential Dilemma [v2.1]: How to confront the imminent and inevitable collapse of global civilization""num_comments":1,"score":9,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"The New Existential Dilemma [v2.1]: How to confront the imminent and inevitable collapse of global civilization"}

The commune was began as a working class and left-leaned revolution based on the legacy of anarchist Phan Boi Chau. The commune was strong and well organized against imperialist forces of French, British and Japanese.

In the late 1945, the tankies under command of Ho Chi Minh, with the ruse that to remove the class traitors, murdered the remaining resisting workers.

It's usually for the same, big reasons that are consistently cited: there was a time when my ancestors lived \"the good life,\" (i.e. full, community rich, healthy, long lives) with minimal technology. They made their living with their minds and easily accessible resources (e.g. hunting tools that take a couple of hours to make). On the contrary, today, we are hyper-dependent on massive chains of systemic technology that truly not any one of us can hope to understand. The automobile engineers don't understand their smart phones, and the Samsung engineer doesn't know what's wrong with her truck. My physics professor, holding a PhD in string theory, couldn't change the brakes in his sedan (and neither can I). The Boeing employee has the vaguest idea of industrial agriculture. My point is obvious: we've been gradually approaching the helplessness of our infancies since the Agricultural Revolution. We used to be at home in the world: we knew how to feed ourselves easily, we knew where to get water, we knew how to build shelter to keep us cool in the summers and warm in the winters. It's scary to be so dependent on a system that is almost 100% out of your control, and I feel scared.\n\n*Resume here if you've skipped the above paragraph: despite living in constant fear of the grocery store and/or power grid going down, I have to acknowledge the truth: I absolutely love many, many things that depend on, as I mentioned earlier, these massive chains of systemic technology. I really like learning Greek on the Duolingo app. Some of the most guiding principles that I live my life by have been taught to me through film, a medium dependent on a massively complicated chain of science, technology, and art, including but not limited to optics, lensmaking, electronics, critical theory, etc. When I hear the Super Metroid theme, waves of nostalgia pour over my entire body. It brings me so much joy to sit down and play the game (although I've banned myself from playing for the past couple of years in my efforts to shy away from big tech).\n\nLike man's best friend, I am a domesticated shell of my wild human ancestors (although I'm working on it). I know we don't blame our lap dogs for being terrible at hunting, but, how can I reconcile my primtivist views with the person I've been shaped into? It makes me incredibly sad to think I'll never play Metroid again. It makes me sad to have to give up taking warm baths. I want to do these things, but, I also want to be independent and strong.\n\nWhat do I do? Is my love of these highly technology-dependent fields akin to a meth addict's love of the drug? Would I miss recorded music less if I built my own wooden flute in the forest? I've tried to philosophically counsel myself, but, I just can't seem to shake this.\n\nP.S. I know that there are those in this subreddit that are opposed to anprimitivism, especially concerning ableism. I think that this topic is more important than the one I've posted about, but, for the sake of relevance, I'd really appreciate if we could save that discussion for another post.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Confessions of a Primitivist"}

{"author":"Lieutenant_Rans","created_utc":1524007800,"num_comments":15,"score":13,"selftext":"I typed up this diatribe in trying to explain what a post-capitalist country/world/system with no prison would look like. I think it's one of the most common questions that pop up -  What the hell do you do with the *bad people*. After all, not all crime is driven by property, and many violent crimes do warrant an incredibly strong response. \n\nSo, please, have at it and rip this to shreds, and maybe something good will survive. \n\n-----\n\n&gt;What the hell do you do with prisons?\n\nStep 1. End the incarceration of property crimes. Looking at the [stats for crime in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_the_United_States), we see that over 90% of crime is property crime, 87% if you count robberies. These problems could be resolved through alternative methods that don't involve the State locking people up - primarily dealing with the economic issues that drive the vast majority of property crimes and using community conflict resolution to deal with the rest of these nonviolent crimes. \n\nStep 2. For violent crime, a community can exile them and warn other communities about their behavior - at some point they'll have to settle down in, say MurderTown USA. I say \"MurderTown\" but keep in mind we're also talking about crimes that maybe aren't as bad or are maybe far worse than murder. These also wouldn't be places you go *to do more murder* any more than prisons are - even murderers don't enjoy being murdered - I just enjoy the name *MurderTown*. A rehabilitative or time allotted process is established to be allow criminals back into your community and any other communities that accept your charges - permanent exile from all civil communities is basically just prison with extra steps. \n\nNo, this doesn't go for all violent crime. Counseling, restorative work to the victim, any other solution comes first. You can have plenty of rehabilitative structures in your community  where you are presented with the option of choosing rehabilitation or choosing to leave. We're talking about the last resorts here, people who are genuinely dangerous if they are not immediately segregated from the community. \n\n-----\n\nObvious Issue #1: MurderTown USA could end up being far too dangerous for surrounding communities, concentrating power in the hands of violent people. Maybe you have laws (well, not laws, but whatever the anarchist equivalent of *law* is) that prevent them from reaching a critical mass - and a process to break up these communities if they create a problem for the neighboring areas. We might not even be talking MurderTowns at this point, maybe we just end up with tiny MurderCommunes. \n\nObvious Issue #2: A community may be able to reject someone, but unless every town has A BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL, there's not exactly much to stop someone from sneaking in. That's a good point. Ankle bracelets, watchdogs that patrol the surrounding areas (and perhaps can monitor ankle bracelets), surveillance, self reporting and self enforcement from MurderTown itself to prevent it from being broken up. \n\nObvious Issue #3: Wait, isn't that just a prison? No, this is not the same as a prison. Yes, this would be functionally similar - but prison abolition isn't about just letting all dangerous people loose on the streets, and there should be some key differences that are already obvious - freedom of movement is there to a degree, there's no slavery (which, currently, we do have, the 13th amendment allows slavery as punishment for a crime), these communities basically run themselves despite the oversight, there are no 6x6 cells, etc. \n\nObvious Issue #4: How would these people eat or get other necessary resources? You can send it to them for whatever they are producing in exchange (since, you know, towns need jobs and people working), nobody has to starve. If they **have** to leave to go to another place or into a surrounding community for whatever reason, you could assign the armed babysitters to make sure they don't get up to anything funny. Think parole, but more parole-ier. \n\n\nObvious Issue #5: Not every violent criminal deserves to go to MurderTown. Well, yeah, you can have exactly the same sliding scale of punishment that we have in our current judicial system - MurderTown *A* might not accept the kinds of crimes that would get you exiled to MurderTown *B*, and so on. Alternative solutions include essentially having volunteers babysit criminals 24/7 in shifts without them being banished. Again, parole but more parole-ier. Hell, maybe you just do that for every violent criminal and we stop talking about MurderTown altogether. \n\nObvious Issue #6: Some people may be just too dangerous, even for MurderTown Z, people who can never be feasibly rehabilitated into society. Now, to be honest that's going to be  *really* small number of people, but it's not zero. For these people, maybe real bona-fide prisons are actually necessary - but by then we've already destroyed 99% of the prison industrial complex and I would not feel horrible calling it a day - although maybe y'all have something better in mind.

The anti-racist movement in my country (UK) is pretty much completely controlled by a group known as Stand Up to Racism. Sounds pretty innocuous at first glance, but this group is a front organisation for the Socialist Workers Party. If you haven\u2019t heard of that, it\u2019s a very bourgeois / ML / Trotskyist party that is most famous in this country for covering up a rape done by one of the committee leaders. They held a kangaroo court and basically shamed and blamed the victim. As far as I know the rapist is still a member of the party. Pretty fucking shit, right? These people should not be allowed to speak on behalf of the left.  \n\nAnyway, pretty much every time the BNP, National Front, EDL etc come to town, the SWP goons are always the first on the scene, organising counter demos and trying to sell copies of their Socialist Worker newspaper. Their demos are pretty problematic to say the least, they don\u2019t actually confront the fash, they stay well behind police lines and have actually been known to work with the cops to incriminate any other more militant antifa groups who dare to act outside the SWP rally.  \n\nI would love to organise a local antifascist group or chapter in my local area since there aren\u2019t any currently here, so that there is an actual radical presence if the fash ever comes back, as well as challenging the monopoly held by rape apologists.

These policies do nothing towards the abolition of the value form or commodity production and exchange--leading to the continued total domination of labor and their livelihoods to the impersonal forces of capital--nor do they do anything to destroy the state apparatus. All of the above seem to be because of a failure in Anarchist thought to subject social and historical phenomena according to an analysis of the material relations that produced them, instead focusing only on a shallow moral (or interest/desire-based in the case of Egoists and Post-Leftists) critique of the aforementioned phenomenon, very much in the way the Liberals and SuccDems you claim to despise do (without the fundamental critique of authority, of course).\n\nThere are also occasions where--due to their emphasis on material analysis--certain Marxists end up being **more Anarchist than many (in some cases, even most) Anarchists**. Take the issue of (majoritarian) democracy, for example. While Anarcho-Syndicalists, many Communalists, and select other Anarchist tendencies support the concept of majoritarian democracy and the continuation of the political form after the \"end\" of capitalism and the state, many LeftComs have understood this as a continuation of class rule and the reservatory ownership of the means of the production, leading *at best* only to the establishment and maintenance of the lower-phase of communism and at worst to the resumption of bourgeois economics and the domination of the individual. In addition, Marx seems to echo Stirner (in fact, it could be interpreted that he *surpasses* him minus the part on the \"essence of man\") in the rejection of spookish concepts with quotes like \"Feuerbach's great achievement is....[t]he proof that philosophy is nothing else but religion rendered into thought and expounded by thought, i.e., another form and manner of existence of the estrangement of the essence of man; hence equally to be condemned....\", while it was claimed by someone in this subreddit, if I recall correctly, that Primitivist Anarchism was as much inspired by the French Ultra-Left (mainly itself inspired by Left-Communism)  as compared to existing Anarchist tendencies.\n\nWith all of this in mind, please understand that I am still an Anarchist and see nothing contradictory between Anarchism and Marxism, but is Anarchist analysis *really* as piss-poor, surface level, non-revolutionary, etc. as I am making it out to be (especially regarding the discourse on the subreddits I mentioned), or do I need to just shut my mouth and start reading more Anarchist theory? I would be very happy to hear any suggestions for texts and other reading material that may be offered that disputes this observation of mine.\n\n**'**: could not think of a better word at the moment\n\nPS: Do not talk about how our contrast with the *authoritarian politics* of Marx and other Marxists makes us wiser, it just showcases an ignorant view of Marxism as some kind of political program, rather than the system of historical, social, and economic analysis that it really is.\n\nPPS: I apologize if this post is hard to read for some or not up to my usual quality, it is late where I live right now and I have not gotten a good sleep in ages. I also hope I have not offended anyone too much by the contents of this post. Lastly, I would like to pre-emptively apologize for any potential ignorance on claims that I made here. Being an Anarchist for almost 2 years now, it is really a disgrace that I have not read nearly as much theory as I could.","subreddit":"Anarchy101","title":"As an Anarchist, I currently feel saddened and discomforted by the apparent poverty of Anarchist analysis.

{"author":"trigwarn","created_utc":1524260466,"num_comments":16,"score":3,"selftext":"The way I understand anarchism, transactional markets are replaced with reciprocity (roughly, gift economies with social reputation used as currency). For the sake of argument I deem various tribal approaches with no money whatsoever utterly naive.\n\nHowever, reciprocity as a system is semantically similiar to keeping the market, and tweaking nature of money - everyone having zero-interest credit line and paying with IOUs, then using peer-pressure to discourage running negative balances - you can settle your own debt with other IOUs of anyone in shared social clique. \n\nSettling old debts also becomes form of haggling - creditors may agree to be repaid less in time of great need, time/value of money is not one way street as wall street banks would like to make us believe. \n\nSimiliar to gift economies, a \"freeloader\" (being in debt towards everyone in their vicinity) will be eventually socially ostracized in the long term, provided people lend same empathy to it (a child, or disabled person is likely to get away with more debt than somebody body-abled etc).\n\nTrying to model such a system on the real world, I ran into difficulties: Trade balances between disparate clusters of the social graph. Each person IOUs circulate only in a tiny social clique, with hawala-esque \"bankers\" relaying more distant cliques, ranging from a class mate you don't personally know/trust, to a chinese fab half a globe afar.\n\nProblem arises: If one clique produces less than another, in short, they become \"freeloader\" in view of the global economy, as a group. Presumably other groups now need to ostracize \"freeloader group\", members of which can be often punished merely for association with people who constantly run debt relative to most other cliques, without themselves doing anything wrong.\n\nIn the end, for a such system to work, one ends up with something scary: Socialized reputation, a'la chinese Sesame. If friends of your friends run up debt god knows where, it will ruin your own reputation. \n\nOr put another way, running a trade deficit as a group, the debt will be socialized to the whole clique in form of damaged reputation. People are not wired to be vested in social standing between friend and some stranger, yet such a system (on account of globally connected social graph) would force us to do so.\n\nSo question is, is there something in socio-economic theory, or anarchic literature elaborating on the problem of globalized reputation/social credit/reputation market?\n\nThis problem of trade balances is common in macro-economic relations between countries. Wars were fought over this, and soviet union in part fell apart because of this, so there are probably no simple answers.\n\nWalls/syndicates/communes/tribes are trivial fix (\"just deglobalize, mang\"). Let me reiterate, I don't consider isolationism/anarcho-primitivism as viable option in lieu cooperation of hyper-connected global actors.\n\n**edit (goalpost moving)**: For the sake of simplicity this model ignores such things like geographic availability of natural resources as well as assumes that no land or material capital can be accumulated - the only form of capital to be accumulated (or owed) is reputation towards close by social peers. The general idea to accomplish that is to incentivize speculation with one's own reputation, as opposed to hoarding material resources or extracting rent by denying others access to common land.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Can LETS (mutual credit) be considered form of \"anarchist banking\"?"}

{"author":"S-lick","created_utc":1524264825,"num_comments":0,"score":10,"selftext":"When people learned about anarchism, and subjected to becoming an anarchist, often these questions come to their mind. What is anarchism? How practical is it? How do I interact and educate others about anarchism? But anarchism is not only about \"agitate, educate, organize\", but to boarder than theories or tendencies and to beyond ideology. It is how to be effectively use these self-educated tendencies and ideologies, to collectively educate and practice them. Direct action should be about mutually exchanged assisstance. I hope this post can be a small addition of experience on how to provide praxis for your group and community.\n\nThe everyday person would ask the most important question when you tried to educate them about anarchism, *how practical is anarchism?* To prove it we must first have something to give to the person, or to the targeted demography that we are worthy to provide them the trust. And nothing is better than using **praxis** to educate people. Praxis is Latin/Greek term for \"practice, application or realization of theory.\" (correct me if I was wrong) Praxis is not only about wheat pasting your neighborhood with poster or handing out pamphlets. The simplest explanation of praxis is to provide your targeted person or people with needs, so then you can provide them the trust and education, not only for ourselves but for their own assistance. Mutual benefit. Praxis does not work with a single side, it must be the flown of interaction between the giver and the receiver, for both must have intertwined exchanges of **mutual aid**, so they can assist and grow our theories, tendencies and community. Mutual praxis to strengthen this relationship.\n\nMutual aid is the fundamental basis of anarchism. This is the difference in the use of praxis between Marxism and anarchism. Mutual aid is about exchanging assistance of needs and benefit between individuals, collectives and societies, without basing on hierachy or structure of an authority. Praxis, can be mutually exchanged to assist comrades on practices of their theories and organizing. **Mutual praxis is solidarity, not charity.**\n\nDiversity of tactics can be used in praxis. [Food Not Bombs](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-a-critical-history-of-harrisonburg-food-not-bombs) and their model, and generally cookout, food drive, potluck, breakfast programs, block party are the easiest, most budget and most effective forms of praxis that can be mutually supporting between communities. Multiple parties can share the loads of work, thus mutually assisted praxis, such as community garden party can provide foods, retail party can provide supplies, someone who can drive for logistics and organizers to give the general support to coordinate between the parties. Food cookouts (and etc.) are extremely flexible in utilizing theories or assistance to certain group in needs. As a hype group for the strike or walk-out to strengthen the morale of the workers. As an educational platform and outreach to working class families and their children. [An example of cookout that was utilized by anarchists during Occupy Mong Kok.](https://libcom.org/blog/mk-hotpot-tensions)\n\nPraxis can be used as the means of protection and self defense, digitally and physically. From [Occupy Wall Street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJeLNb9ansc) (Jake was a dipshit, but no doubt he was an anarchist that played important role in training OWS people), Arab Springs to Occupy Central, [tech workers and students provided on-the-ground training platforms in privacy and security for protesters.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx93WJPCCGs) Makeshift crypto-parties were mutually organized and provided to people about the importance of encryption, [mesh networking](http://observer.com/2014/10/firechat-the-app-that-fueled-hong-kongs-umbrella-revolution/), and how to deal with LEO. Examples of physical protection from mutual aided praxis are the armed training network between [Redneck Revolt, Socialist Rifle Association, Trigger Warning and other left or minority militias](https://socialistra.org/news/prdc). r/SocialistRA\n\nPraxis can be an emergency assistance in disaster or urgency. [Common Ground Collective](http://www.commongroundrelief.org/) is the [largest](https://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/repression-against-grassroots-hurricane-relief-lingers-in-new-orleans/) anarchist organization in modern US history.

Sorry for the use of a throwaway, but can't be too careful.\n\nSo this anarchist library/social space I'm nearby to in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada called The Tower is in need of legal funding assistance.\n\nA fellow comrade by the name of Cedar was arrested in a SWAT police raid on April 6th. Later on they were not only charged with \"conspiracy to commit an indictable offense\" (in relation to previous events that occurred in March), but they were more recently denied bail. More details and context is provided within the donation link: [http://fundraising.the-tower.ca/](http://fundraising.the-tower.ca/). I will also link to the support blog that is currently being used to provide updates on Cedar's legal situation: [https://hamiltonanarchistsupport.noblogs.org/](https://hamiltonanarchistsupport.noblogs.org/).  \n\n**NOTE**: Just to make things crystal clear, I am not the one updating either the donation page or the update blog. I'm merely sharing these links in order to get some more attention to the situation and hopefully get more funding support to help out a fellow anarchist. The other part of the reason why I'm doing this is because the last thing I want is Cedar's case being used as an example to allow the repression of other vocal individuals in future situations.\n\nIf you are still uncertain, Cedar did recently get a shout out in subMedia's latest episode of their show *The Fukin\u2019 News*.

Our extension has been conditional on a rent increase at outright ridiculous levels, and we do not intend to accept it. This association does not bend for bombs, bureaucrats or bourgeois\u2019 perception of market rents \u2013 but now the hunt for our next home begins. The idea of packing up, tearing down, financing, finding a new place, moving and building is admittedly tough, but we have since a while back grown out of the book caf\u00e9 and we are looking forward to building something even better.\n\n\n\nDo you have tips for locations/premises? Do you want to organise with us? Can you assist with moving help, demolition or renovation things? Can you hold a support party? We will soon publish a fundraising campaign for the costs that will inevitably occur in connection with moving. The least we expect from our comrades is that they help us spread it.\n\n\nSyndicalist Forum was formed in 1980 by people in and around Gothenburg, but in the 1970s some of the founders had driven the Libertarian Forum in Haga. Since then, the association has been on Spr\u00e4ngkullsgatan, Landsv\u00e4gsgatan and in Folkets Hus on J\u00e4rntorget before we took over a dilapidated Linux cafe at \u00d6vre Husargatan in 2012. We have had six years on historic grounds, just a few hundred meters from the place where the hunger riots of 1917 took place beginning with the storming of Olof Asklund\u2019s Steam Bakery. We are indescribably proud of the activities we have built here, but nostalgia is not for us and we need Linn\u00e9staden about as much as you need your dickhead of a boss.\n\n\nAs long as there is a movement for the abolition of class society and patriarchy, it will need meeting places, infrastructure and a toolbox with subversive theory. As long as you struggle, we promise to continue offering it, in our firm belief that another world is not only possible but absolutely necessary.\n\n\nForwards!\n\nWith comradely greetings, Syndicalist Forum","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Gothenburg Syndicalist Forum forced to move - we remember 2012-2018 at \u00d6vre Husargatan 27"}

If there isn\u2019t enough interest, I would conduct one-on-one pseudo-interviews instead. If you are interested, please send me an email at caleb.m.johnson1997@gmail.com.

The student then wrote a blog addressing this and it spread like wildfire within the Chinese Wechat community (Think Whatsapp but with a newsfeed and other features). The government moved quickly and censored the blog and used image recognition software to censor any screenshots of the blog from being shared.

Congratulations, and welcome to the dark side. ;)\n\nMany people arriving at this sub may have only recently taken an interest in guns, and a lot of us may have limited or no prior experience with firearms whatsoever. That's more than fine, we all started somewhere. One of the most common questions seen on this sub, especially from first-timers, is \"well, what kind of gun should I buy?\" and I'm here to tell you why the answer to that question is an AR-15.\n\n**What is an AR-15?**\n\nThe AR-15 (which stands for \"ArmaLite rifle, design 15\") as we know it today, by far the most popular gun in the US, is a semi-automatic centrefire rifle based off of Eugene Stoner's original, late 1950s design that was later adopted into the US military's M16 service rifle. Since then, the civilian legal (read: semi-automatic) version has evolved greatly into an iconic staple of American gun ownership, noted for its modularity as well as its popularity and the wide availability of parts and ammunition for it. On the flipside, it has also been under constant fire for being such a ubiquitous \"military-style assault weapon\" and is often vilified by the liberal media and targeted by restrictive gun laws.\n\n**Why do I want an AR-15?**\n\nPut simply, it's the most popular rifle in the country for a reason. They are inexpensive, *good rifles*. AR prices are lower than ever, and an AR is basically going to be able to do whatever you want it to do, however you want it to be done. They are incredibly versatile and can be used for anything from hunting to self-defense to just having fun at the range.\n\nThe nature of the AR platform makes the rifle incredibly easy to assemble, modify, expand upon, and otherwise customise. Since the rifle is so popular, there is a vast amount of parts for it including triggers, furniture, barrels, bolt carriers, etc. that can easily be swapped in and out to one's desire. The entire top half of the gun (called the upper receiver) can be popped on and off in less than 30 seconds.\n\nThe standard round fired by the AR-15 and M16/M4 (5.56x45 mm NATO, also called .223 Remington) is cheap, has very little recoil, and widely available in a variety of offerings from steel-cased FMJ ammo for cheap plinking all the way to rounds like Hornady TAP designed for self-defense. While 5.56 is a great round (and, imo, the best option for something like home defense), calibre conversions with an AR-15 are also quite easy and there are a ton of other calibres such as 300 BLK (similar to 7.62x39 mm from an AK-47 or SKS and particularly fantastic for short barrel and/or suppressed shooting) or 6.5 Grendel (which was designed to shoot flatter and further and offers close to 7.62x51/.308 ballistics in an AR-15 sized package).\n\n**What kind of AR-15 should I get?**\n\nThe most commonly recommended AR is something inexpensive and entry level like a Smith &amp; Wesson M&amp;P Sport II or a Ruger AR-556. Buy it, shoot it (a lot), get comfortable with it and learn about it. From there, you can modify it and address anything you'd like to improve with the rifle *as you've experienced it*.\n\nI also recommend building an AR-15, which can be as basic as buying completed upper and lower receivers and sticking them together or as advanced as assembling every part depending on your enthusiasm, willingness to learn, and access to tools. I personally assembled a lower receiver with a stripped lower and a lower parts kit (LPK), and bought a completed/barreled upper receiver from Palmetto State Armory. Building one can usually give you a more personalised gun at a better price, especially if you want more than just the basics.\n\n**But everyone keeps telling me to get a Mosin-Nagant!**\n\nI am not a fan of the Mosin-Nagant platform. They're fun and lots of people think they're cool, but at the end of the day they are shitty guns with dubious efficacy in any sort of modern-day rifle usage scenario (self-defense, hunting, all-out war, etc.). Mosins were popular when they cost less than $100 apiece and when surplus ammo was dirt cheap, but I'm of the opinion that people need to stop recommending century old combloc platforms for people to defend themselves in an era where states use *fucking drones* in warfare. They're also *terrible* guns for first time shooters.\n\n**But I want an AK!**\n\nCool, I do too. AKs have a certain appeal to them that I can't deny, but as an owner of both I'm going to have to recommend the AR over the AK. AKs these days are more expensive and are, quite frankly, not as nice. They're heavier, less ergonomic, not as robust, not nearly as customisable, and their only advantage of \"it goes bang every time\" is largely irrelevant with modern ARs as long as you have a fraction of an idea on how to clean and maintain a gun. If you want an AK, go for it. They're still great guns and I have to admire the Kalashnikov platform, but I am going to argue that an AR-15 is a much better gun for the \"what gun do I get?\" question.\n\n**But I hate America and its imperialism, why would I use the same guns as the fat rednecks at the range?**\n\nGet over it. You want to use whatever is easiest, cheapest, most available, etc. and that happens to be an AR-15 if you live in the US. They're also really good guns and basically the American equivalent of the \"people's rifle\" if you're into that kind of thing. The only people disagreeing are circlejerking, violence-fetishising tankies who worship the USSR and think that having a hammer and sickle on their gun from the late 1800s is the coolest thing ever. I'm sorry, but it had to be said.\n\n**What about the Ruger 10/22?**\n\nThis is the #1 recommended first timer gun on /r/guns and is at the top of their FAQ. Ruger 10/22s are cheap and they are the perfect guns to learn the basics on, get comfortable with guns, and practice marksmanship. .22 LR costs pennies per round, has virtually no recoil, and is incredibly fun to plink with. Unfortunately, the benefits pretty much stop there, and a 10/22 is not going to be very useful in other situations except maybe hunting squirrels. I also own a Ruger 10/22, but I suggest looking elsewhere if you want a single, do-it-all gun to do things with other than shooting at paper.\n\n**What about shotguns?**\n\nI hate shotguns, but that's just me. I do, however, also believe that shotguns serve very little purpose in today's world aside from sporting. If you want a shotgun, go for it, but I don't recommend having one as a primary gun: they kick hard, have limited range, and I don't think they're any more effective than rifles. Even for home defense, I believe an AR-15 is going to be superior while also being able to do a whole lot more than just kill small and game bad guys right in front of you.\n\n**What about handguns?**\n\nHandguns have the distinct advantage of being small. They're easier to manoeuvre, and they can be carried/concealed. However, they're also a lot harder to shoot and most handgun rounds have inferior ballistics compared to rifle rounds. Handguns are nice, but again they should be secondary options. There is a quote that goes around every now and then that says something along the lines of \"the only reason you should be using your handgun is to safely get to your rifle.\"\n\n**What if I can't afford an AR?**\n\nUnfortunately, guns and ammo aren't cheap. However, ARs are very affordable. I assembled one in a studio apartment with $20 worth of tools, and the total cost came out to be just over $400. You can't beat that price for a modern rifle, and for less money than that you're basically limited to milsurp bolt-action garbage rods, low-end shotguns, or shitty handguns like Tauruses that are notorious for poor quality. My advice would be to save up unless you're really in a bind, in which case something is still better than nothing.\n\n**What if I live in a state that has laws against \"assault weapons?\"**\n\nThis puts you in a bit of a tricky situation. Some states like Maryland allow AR-15s if they are HBAR (heavy-barreled), whereas other states like California require the rifles to be \"featureless\" which means they cannot have certain banned features such as pistol grips, flash hiders, and adjustable stocks. If you are in a predicament like this, you will have to consider your options and find what works best. I tend to suggest the SKS as an alternative if those aren't also banned, and I think Mini-14s are nothing more than overpriced hipster guns. Once again, you will have to take a more pragmatic approach and take the government's needs in addition to your own.\n\n**What if I don't live in the US?**\n\nUnfortunately, this guide is not for you. I know very little about gun laws outside of the US, and generally when in a situation like that, the best advice is to get whatever you can.\n\n**Anything else?**\n\nI think that's pretty much it. Please let me know if you have any questions, think I missed something, need me to clarify anything, agree/disagree with me, etc. or (especially) if there are any shortcomings I need to address.\n\nShooting is a hobby like any other, and you're bound to find people with different opinions. I am merely offering mine. At the end of the day, shooting (especially something like self-defense) is a personal decision and it's up to the individual to decide what works best for them and practise with it. Guns are also simply tools like any other and gun ownership and education is only part of the solution to any theoretical problem.\n\nIf you want to learn more, I'd be happy to answer any questions. There are also a ton of other resources on the internet, including /r/guns (as long as you stay out of the politics threads, definitely hit up that FAQ though). I recommend reading and learning as much as you can, and taking whatever possible opportunities there are to go shooting and get that experience.","subreddit":"AnarchistRC","title":"Why you (yes, you) should get an AR-15""num_comments":28,"score":13,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"xpost from /r/AnarchistRC - Why you (yes, you) should get an AR-15"}

It's literally just me except for one or two days a month when I need to pay a friend to help me. That said, I can foresee a day when I have more work than I can do myself, plus the work is physically taxing to do solo and it's nice to have company sometimes. I have no interest in being a boss, and very much interest in helping form a worker coop of other horticulturists. The problem is I don't think I know any other leftists who do this type of work. I feel like I will be able to find resources to help me with the logistics of transition into that model (though any suggestions on this area are welcome as well), but my true stumbling block will be finding other participants.
