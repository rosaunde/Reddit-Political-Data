{"author":"Dr_Jorge","created_utc":1525177258,"num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"The Israel-Palestine difference is arguably the longest-standing territorial dispute in the history of humanity. The Genesis had already referred to the enemies of Sion (nowadays Jerusalem). Recently the area has been on the news since President Trump announced the intention to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Days ago more people were killed (demonstrators from Gaza). The domestic, regional and international issues at stake are many and highly complex. There are proposals for a Two States solutions. A recent poll (2018) gives a better picture of what Israelis and Palestinians want. Yet, no solution is on the horizon. \n\nThis blog series I called TERRITORIAL DISPUTES offers an open platform for discussion. As with the previous reviewed disputes, post 1 introduced very broadly the context and the parties. Posts 2, 3, and 4 presented the views in Israel and Palestine by including academic and non-academic sources with the intention to show there are different perceptions about this conflict amongst the three main parties and within each of them. Post 5 departs from the methodology used to assess previous TERRITORIAL DISPUTES (so far Kashmir, the Falkland/Malvinas islands and Gibraltar) and instead of introducing directly the EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY as a means to solve the issue, this time we centre the attention on determining WHO counts. That is to say, who can be considered a legitimate party in this sovereignty dispute. I introduce the concept of \"colourable claim\" to answer the question. This week the posts will examine this and other points in more detail. \n\nA reminder to the reader, this is a series I called TERRITORIAL DISPUTES. I introduced basic conceptual elements and thereafter, I apply a theoretical frame (based on Rawlsian methodology) to solve well-known sovereignty disputes or conflicts. I explore what reasonable people would do in a territorial dispute. This is a theoretical experiment that deals with IDEAL theory only. There is no claim to NON IDEAL theory hence issues like lack of compliance are not explored.\n\nIn order to do it, I assume the representatives of each claiming party (sovereign States and a non-sovereign character) choose a rule based on theory game. I go for the maximin. From there, these ideal people come up with a solution to the conflict. \n\nREMINDER Note: I\u2019ll only post on r/Libertarian on Tuesday a summary of what I do weekly on the blog to avoid spamming this sub-reedit as that is not my intention. I only aim to open a healthy discussion.\n\nComments welcomed. Guest writers would be hugely appreciated. As you may see from the posts I don't take sides and I do this with utmost respect to all people involved. I'd appreciate the same respect in the discussion. I don't claim to have the solution. As I've just mention, I only aim to offer an open floor for discussion. Enjoy!\n\nPost 1\nhttp://london1701.blogspot.co.uk/2018/04/territorial-disputes-israel-palestine.html?m=1\n\nPost 2\nhttp://london1701.blogspot.co.uk/2018/04/territorial-disputes-israel-palestine_24.html?m=1\n\nPost 3\nhttp://london1701.blogspot.co.uk/2018/04/territorial-disputes-israel-palestine_25.html?m=1\n\nPost 4\nhttp://london1701.blogspot.co.uk/2018/04/territorial-disputes-israel-palestine_26.html?m=1\n\nPost 5\nhttp://london1701.blogspot.co.uk/2018/04/territorial-disputes-israel-palestine_27.html?m=1\n\nRegards.

It shows the logical result of the widespread acceptance of the idea that rights are mere privileges bestowed by government. It follows from this idea that rights can be taken away whenever demanded by government officials or the popular will.\n\nOf course, most western politicians deny they believe rights come from government. They instead claim that government must place \u201creasonable\u201d limits on rights to advance important policy goals, such as limiting the right to free speech to protect certain groups from hate speech, or limiting property rights to promote economic equality. But, a right by its very nature cannot be limited or abolished and still be a right.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Founding Fathers rejected the idea that rights come from government. They instead embraced the view that rights are either granted by the creator or are a basic attribute of humanity.\n\nSince rights do not come from government, government has no more legitimate authority to violate our rights than does a private individual. Thus, if an individual cannot use force to make you help others, neither can the government. If an individual cannot use force to stop you from gambling online or telling un-PC jokes, neither can the government.

Because the same fucking thing happened - people pointed this out - the same thing happened 10 years ago with Colbert when he was at the Correspondents Dinner in - I believe - 2006 and he roasted Bush to his face and everyone was horrified and there was a whole debate about: did he go too far, is there such a thing as too far, what are comedians supposed to do? But real heads know that this actually also happened 20 years ago, because in 1996, Don Imus was the comic at the White House Correspondents Dinner, and he did a bunch of jokes about how Bill Clinton was a horny freak and that caused a giant wailing and gnashing of teeth. There was no Twitter, but if there had been, everyone would have lost their shit. \n&gt; \n&gt; It's the same fucking argument over and over and nothing ever changes about it. It's enough to make you go insane, because since Trump\u2019s been elected, every bit of real estate in the op-ed world has been elite media people worrying about the free exchange of ideas. \"Oh no, the Twitter hordes and the Campus PC police are going to get rid of free speech, we're not going to be able to exchange ideas, we're not going to be able to have a marketplace of free expression anymore!\" \n&gt; \n&gt; I mean, forget the fact that we've got a domestic Gestapo running around in ICE, or Gilded Age-level inequality, or an impending climate catastrophe that could end all fucking life on Earth, the only thing that matters to these people is whether or not we have enough of a safe realm for respectful debate. Because according to these people we can't solve any of these problems unless we have a public debate that can reason out our differences and lead us to a Habermasian compromise that can be good for the majority of people, but this is a perfect example of why that's a complete fraud. \n&gt; \n&gt; We've had the same argument for 20 fucking years and it never changes, and it can't change! It's going to be the same debate, and the same sides, and same argument, over and over and over again, because the structure of power and the relationship between the media and the White House is such that these people are always going to feel more social connection with each other than they do with the American people - or anybody who makes less than six figures a year - so they're always going to have this jocularity, and they're always going to want to be buddies with each other. \n&gt; \n&gt; And nothing like the invasion of Iraq or a white supremacist president is going to change any of that, but that's going to make them uncomfortable too, so they're always going to bring in these comics to try to push the boundaries - and then they're going to push too far, and then everything's going to snap into a frenzy to try to re-establish the boundaries so that we can maintain these convivial relationships, but then we have the argument first and nothing can change that, because the social and economic structure of DC means that that relationship is always going to be there and the debate is just a release valve from a closed mechanism that will persist as long as the system does.\n&gt; \n&gt; And so there is no exchange of ideas, they're not building to anything, the debate isn't creating any movement and it isn't shifting anything, it's just totally sterile. The marketplace of ideas is like the free market, it's just this illusion of agency disguising a rigid economically determined status quo, and that denies all your human freedom or even meaningful expression, because how is expression meaningful if you can't fucking affect anything?\n\n","subreddit":"ChapoTrapHouse","title":"Matt's rant from episode 206 on the WHCD controversy, transcribed""num_comments":1,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Matt's rant from episode 206 on the WHCD controversy, transcribed"}

If faced with killing a single man to save the entire planet the only moral choice would be to allow him to live unless he gives consent. Although in reality i would probably violate my beliefs and kill him since I dont want everyone to die.\n\nIt does lead me to a contradiction about taxes though. What i need cleared up is technically, dont we consent to taxes?\n\nI mean think of a college frat where the house has voted upon rules and a monthly fund that everyone has to contribute. This is based on consent because the group owns the frat, and so they have a right to institute rules. The individual has the choice to either agree to pay to live on this property which isnt his or he can choose to live somewhere else. It isnt his property so he doesnt have an inherent right to live there. This is a system based on consent isnt it?\n\nThe logic extends to private property. In order to declare a room his the individual first has to establish he even has a right to be in the house, which is agreeing with its taxation rules.\n\nIn the same way im not sure how i can build a house and declare it private property and therefore not something the state cant violate, if i havnt established that i rightfully am allowed to be within the borders of the country in the first place, which is property of the group\n\n\nThis is annoying because i want to support libertarian candidates and policies, but it seems like everything circles back to this argument.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How do I reconcile this?"}

However, we also reached two important conclusions:\n1) Helping the countries from which these migrants hail is the optimal solution to the problem. It follows that foreign aid to Central American nations is likely our best spent foreign aid provided it is given with sufficient oversight. \n2) The biggest challenge the countries to our South face is brutal cartel violence and corruption (which are often connected). Of course, these cartels are funded by the massive drug consumption of the US citizens. In a way, private US citizens are indirectly funding militant cartels to provide drugs to the US market. \n\nFrom these two points, I concluded that the most important thing that the United States ought to do to encourage positive development in Latin American nations is to take down the cartels by legalizing the production and distribution of all drugs within the United States. The economic advantage granted to domestic producers that function legally within the US economy will almost certainly eradicate all profitability of the cartels. The tax revenue generated and the enforcement expenditures retained from this switch are an additional bonus.\n\nI also believe, however, that the drug market would need to be heavily regulated. I also believe that this is a point that is often overlooked in proposals to legalize drugs. I can't help but be concerned that if we aren't careful about legalization, we could end up with an opiate addicted nation like China in the 1800s. With that in mind, I would advocate the following:\n- All drugs are legal to produce and distribute to pharmacies around the country in compliance with pharmaceutical regulations. \n- The advertisement of all recreational drugs will be banned entirely.\n- Packaging of all recreational drugs will contain warnings regarding the drug's dangers and lethality.\n- All recreational drugs will be required to be purchased behind the counter with an ID and purchase limits (similarly to how pseudophedrine is purchased).\n- Keep the possession and use of certain drugs (opiates, especially) illegal. \n\nIt seems somewhat contradictory to allow the production and distribution of drugs to be legal while still banning its possession and consumption, but yet it's a solution that simultaneously punishes use and/or abuse while eliminating the violent drug trade. It's important to point out that something like over half of our violent crime in the country is drug related meaning Americans would benefit even if they don't see the effects of Latin American cartels within their own communities.\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Best Way to End the War on Drugs"}

{"author":"Msmith68w","created_utc":1525363050,"num_comments":157,"score":58,"selftext":"*Disclaimer: I realize Libertarianism is separate from Conservatism. I use the slash to say that I'm Libertarian on some issues and Conservative on others. Not fully in either camp. Use the political compass to see what I mean if this is confusing: https://www.politicalcompass.org/analysis2*\n\nI thought I'd take a few moments to share the story of my political transformation to give you all some hope or a good laugh.  \n\nI grew up in what I would call a slightly right leaning family. We never discussed politics, but as far as I am aware, they have all been voting mostly republican for decades. I never really agreed with my family about religion, and that was a wedge that drove us apart. I saw their religiosity as an underlying driver of their conservatism so I have no doubt that made me more sensitive to leftist ideology.\n\nGrowing up, I didn't give politics a lot of thought. I operated according to a quote from the comedian Lewis Black \"Choosing between republican and democrat is like choosing from two bowls of shit, the only difference is the smell\". I never had faith that political activism meant or accomplished anything, so I didn't vote, and didn't follow politics at all. \n\nIn college, I mostly maintained this belief but was starting to be drawn in by liberal ideas. Whenever politics came up, all the very highly educated, articulate, intellectuals I knew (professors and such) were very vocally on the left. As I got further into academia and began to really respect the pursuit of knowledge and intellectualism, I found myself following in their footsteps. I remember thinking...these people are doctors and lawyers and university professors. They're very intelligent people who think things through. Clearly they understand the ramifications of political ideologies better than my parents and grandparents who are only high school graduates with lower-middle class careers. I actually remember having a conversation with my grandfather (the sweetest man in the world) who asked me \"At your university, are all the professors liberal and atheist?\" to which I responded \"Well yeah, I think being smart and being liberal/atheist go hand in hand\"...not proud of that statement.\n\nI entered graduate school in 2015 at about the time Bernie Sanders began his campaign. I remember reading all these articles (with scholarly references) talking about how his ideas were so good and would be great for the economy. I got really into watching videos created by Robert Reich (former labor secretary under clinton and now UC Berkely professor) including his documentary \"Inequality For All\". The idea that the rich were raping and pillaging our society was something I deeply believed in. I started to declare that we needed to \"get money out of politics\" and \"make the rich pay their fair share\". \n\nI believed in the wage gap, gay marriage (still do on this one), and transgender advocacy. I thought the US was doing more harm in the world than good with our military action. I believed in campus rape culture, systemic racism/sexism, women's right to choose, and the wonders of social medicine. I thought the right was full of hypocrites that were religiously motivated and only thinly veiling their desires to force jesus into everyone's bedrooms. \n\nDuring the 2016 election, I constantly hounded my family to vote against Trump. Not because Hillary was so great, but because Trump was so awful. He was a rich (worst sin of all), white, male who assaulted women, hated blacks, and wanted nothing more than to give tax breaks to his billionaire buddies by pandering to ignorant christian conservatives. He was crazy and couldn't be trusted with nuclear codes. He would bankrupt the country and get us into wars because of his huge ego. I was downright rude to my family and talked down to them when they tried to articulate why they couldn't vote for Hillary(they didn't like Trump either). I made the case that government isn't a business and can't be run like one. I implied that they were stupid and racist....and I'm ashamed of all of it. \n\nThe 2016 election results were a shock. I think everyone expected a landslide for Clinton. I didn't participate much in the outrage or backlash that occurred, I sort of just tuned it all out and went back to living my life. \n\nNearly a year passed. I graduated school and landed my first big job...at a university...in an office full of very liberal women. I participated in the off hand Trump bashing, and it certainly helped develop rapport. \n\nAnd then, something interesting happened...Parkland. Specifically, the CNN Gun Control Town Hall.\n\nYou see, I didn't go straight from high school to college. I did an enlistment with the US Army. So I was quite familiar with firearms and AR-15/M16's specifically, and the utter nonsense (never-mind the blatant disregard for decency) that was spouted during that town hall, and in the media surrounding it, gave me pause. How could some of the most intelligent people I know, people who's careers are built on creating air-tight arguments/hypotheses, regurgitate such drivel. It was clear that they hadn't done 5 seconds of research on the topic. They just swallowed, accepted, and spat back out a bunch of garbage statistics about \"gun violence\" without looking at the methodology. They got up on their soap box and voiced platitude after platitude about how civilians shouldn't have \"weapons of war\". At the same time, they were also condemning police officers (the state) for killing innocent, unarmed citizens (mostly black men). How could they not see this contradiction. The government should have a monopoly on firearms but yet the government is killing innocents? What?\n\nAbout this time, I discovered Steven Crowder, Jordan Peterson, and Ben Shapiro...and down the rabbit hole I went. Issue after issue, I learned new information that completely opened my eyes...and I changed my mind. \n\nI began to see that the lack of rational thought applied to the gun debate was applied to everything my liberal cohorts believed. There are 3 women and two men in my office. Two of the women make $100,000+ yearly, the other makes over $50,000. The two men make under $50,000...and yet, the highest paid woman in my office says things like \"I get paid 77 cents on the dollar a man makes\" and \"women are underrepresented in research\"...when over 70 percent of our study participants are women. \n\nAnother that really got me was gender relations/political correctness. I am so sick and tired of being told that I'm a white man so I'm so fucking privileged and I'm an oppressor to everyone else. That my opinions and problems don't matter, and that I must be a racist/bigoted/violent/rapist who's propagating \"the patriarchy\". I'm tired of being shamed for being a man who's masculine and wanting to date/marry women who are feminine. I'm tired of 3rd wave feminism, the neutering of boys, and the attacking of good people who didn't hurt anyone. \n\nIssue by issue, week by week, I have found my old views to be 180 degrees wrong. I am now pro-life (with an exception for life of mother), anti-big government, etc...and happy about it. To use the o so overused phrase...I feel like I've taken the red pill and I can now see what truly is, rather than what I've been told to see. \n\nThanks for reading.

When it comes to taxation, people seem to act like they have no alternative, and use this to justify a victim mentality. \n\nOften enough, regarding border control, welfare, subsidies, and so forth, I ask some libertarians why they give a shit. We don't have democratic control of the state - at all. We can't fix it. And so we can whine and complain and align ourselves with the Republican Party - a very dubiously \"libertarian\" institution, or we can make decisions regarding our life and livelihood that render the state irrelevant. This is the concept of Agorism.\n\n- We can move to states and countries with more favorable rates of taxation or a lack of taxation entirely.\n\n- We can live in un-taxable structures such a floating homes.\n\n- We can get our land classed with various conservation easements which lower our tax bill.\n\n- We can engage in the underground economy through cryptocurrencies, small-scale face-to-face exchange, and online cottage industries.\n\n- We can achieve a higher level of self-sufficiency in our communities by moving production of goods to a local or home-scale level. \n\nI say this as someone who has managed to extricate myself from much of the financial system. My contributions to local, state, and federal governments amount to less than 1% of my income by careful strategy. I just got sick of whining about \"tax and spend politicians\" and decided to divest from their system. \n\nAnyway, those are some observations of mine. I'm curious if others have noticed this or can provide some reason why this self-victimization produces anything but unnecessary stress and excuses for apathy. \n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Is it just me, or do a large number of libertarian taxpayers victimize themselves? / Why aren't more people practicing agorism?"}

{"author":"Bigbluebuttonman","created_utc":1525490652,"num_comments":19,"score":7,"selftext":"How did you become a Libertarian? What was it that made you into one? Was it a quick process, a long drawn out process? Were you always one, or did you just recently become one? **TL;DR at bottom.**\n\nMy inner awakening first began with the 2016 election. Before then, I didn't really care too much about Politics or my political position very much. However, as my family began to pay more attention and so did I, I began to really start considering where I stood. I was pretty skeptical about Donald Trump \\(I still don't like him for various reasons\\), but it also exposed me to more of the Politics in general; Bernie, Hillary, all the rest, and all the scandals involving all of the actors, and paying more attention to what my government was actually doing.\n\nThe political direction spurred consistent political conversations with me and my parents, typically in the car, including the role of government, the status of America as it is, and about political ideologies as well, and a variety of other subjects, usually out of conversations stemming from the daily news \\(the quality of it and the subjects of it\\).\n\nWhat really kicked me in the head was really seeing how much of America and the people seemed to care little about liberty or what America was really founded on, let alone at least adhering to those principles. At first I thought it was just the Left that was mostly the problem, but it became clear after a while that I wasn't going to find too much hope in the Right either.\n\nWhat finally cracked open my inner Libertarian however was my exploration of this masterpiece:\n\nThe Gulag Archipelago Volumes [1](https://ia801308.us.archive.org/0/items/TheGulagArchipelago-Threevolumes/The-Gulag-Archipelago__vol1__I-II__Solzhenitsyn.pdf), [2](https://ia801308.us.archive.org/0/items/TheGulagArchipelago-Threevolumes/The-Gulag-Archipelago__vol2__III-IV__Solzhenitsyn.pdf), and [3](https://ia601308.us.archive.org/0/items/TheGulagArchipelago-Threevolumes/The-Gulag-Archipelago__vol3__V-VII__Solzhenitsyn.pdf). \\(It's very good, have all the volumes with you in one way or another\\).\n\nToo many people seem to simply exercise absolutely no concern or caution when it comes to government expansion \\(in any way, no matter who's doing it\\), and while it's true that the government is ever changing and does need to change, I'm scared that everyone who can influence that change is doing it in almost all the wrong ways. They want to throw the government at every tiny little problem, thinking that'll solve it, not exacerbate it, and while I think we might need a new amendment or two \\(particularly in regards to corporations and their degree of interaction with the state\\), relatively few have that in mind; more people, I fear, want to remove amendments, not add ones.\n\nLooking at other governments in the contemporary world and our own government *already* convinced me that the solution is less government reach and spending, not more of it, from either party, prior to reading Solzhenitsyn's work.\n\nI'm only 500 pages into Volume 1, but that was enough for me to conclude that I was pretty much a full\\-blown Libertarian on top of my earlier explorations. Even though it's primarily about the Gulag, it's nearly a full exploration of totalitarianism and the mechanisms that drive it, down to the very thought processes of the masses; every 2 or 3 pages I just kept on thinking about so much of what I'd learned over the years, all the information I'd acquired in regards to either history, or what people are doing now and how, why; the average Joe or the government law\\-makers.\n\nToo many people just really don't have any self awareness of what a government can do when it has too much control, both in terms of stupid decision making and malicious decision making alike for any area of government...and more importantly how it even gets to that point. The first step to authoritarians committing debauchery at any level or in any sect of government is for people to have the mindsets necessary to either enable them, or to commit them themselves \\(or both at the same time\\).\n\nThis can be in force; 20 years after a forceful take over in some manner, the populace has been significantly conditioned in one way or another so as to make it hard for any change in the authoritarian/totalitarian nature of the government.\n\nOr it can be voluntary; people give somebody the power necessary to commit debauchery, either because they're desperate...or because they simply don't know any better.\n\nI'm not sure if America knows better right now, honestly and I'm worried we're on a course where this will only get worse, for various reasons.\n\n**TL;DR:** The 2016 election, which spurred a heightened attention to politics and political discourse, but especially reading the Gulag Archipelago has turned me into a full\\-fledged Libertarian.\n\nBut that's just me, what about you guys? How'd you guys become Libertarians?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Describe the path you took to awakening your inner Libertarian."}

I am someone who was first exposed to Libertarian thought through Youtube thinkers about a year/year and a half ago and I have since gone from someone who was a furious Bernie man to a pretty fiscally right wing guy who believes firmly in the free market. Where my belief in Libertarianism and small government wavers is regarding monopolies and market collusion. The free market is great with regards to the production of Tables for instance. Barriers to entry into the table market is pretty cheap and if market collusion started going down in the table market, firms would flood in to reap the profits of offering lower prices. Where it seems less effective is regarding say railways and/or ISPs. I'm going to use railways as the example in the UK as they are what I know best. Creating new railway lines or buying new trains to offer lower prices is an extremely high barrier to entry and the few firms in the market without a doubt collude, be it tacitly or explicitly. The same can be said for ISPs in the US. I have limited knowledge of this, but I heard that in many areas of the US, there are only one or two ISP firns you have a choice between because they own all the lines and the barriers to entry are incredibly high. As a result, consumers pay extortionate prices in both examples and the free market seems to be failing the consumer. How do you rectify this with more free-choice because as far as I can see, the government getting involved and creating competition seems like a more practically beneficial solution for consumers.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Curious about Libertarian thoughts on natural monopolies and Market Collusion"}

The most convincing argument I've heard to date is that by neutering the government's power over society to the bare minimum required to function, there would be far less to lobby over. The representatives can't be bought if there's nothing for people to buy.\n\nI would be happy with this argument if there was an actual historic precedence of this concept working as intended. The 1st United States Congress, for all intents and purposes, was a libertarian paradise. Yet, it took less than 250 years to go from a nearly non\\-existent government to the monstrosity we have today. While the US government started with very limited power, it didn't take long before it decided that it needs more , often as a result of lobbying by special interest groups to \"fix\" what they've deemed at the time to be a market failure. I've seen many libertarians, without irony, talk about how big government and crony capitalism is the cause of all the woes in society today while simultaneously proclaiming that money is free speech and the limiting of political contributions is an infringement upon their 1st amendment rights. It's almost as if it doesn't occur to them that the latter is directly responsible for the former. Once the government snowball begins rolling, there's very little that will stand in its way. In \"The Dictator's Handbook: How Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics\", the authors make a compelling case that the complexity of the regulations and tax codes in a democratic society are simply the result of \"politicians doing what politicians inevitably do: rewarding their supporters at the expense of everyone else. This is why sheaves of pages in the tax codes are dedicated to farmers \\- a crucial coalition for some politicians, who need to receive their rewards if their senators and representatives are to remain in power.\"\n\nSo here's my question to you all: If we were to able to revert the state of government to one similar to that of the 18th century US tomorrow, what is there to stop the lobbyists of special interest groups from unfolding the same course of events over the next 250 years?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Preserving a small, limited government while permitting unadulterated lobbying"}

That brought us slavery, child labor, indentured servitude, the destruction of the environment, tobacco companies and oil companies lying about the results of their products, and so on.  All of those things I listed had to be ended by the government, not by the free market.\n\nLiberatarians always seem to argue something like \"well if a business practices poor ethics, the people will vote with their dollars and put them out of buisness\".  Well, why didn't that happen with slavery?  Why did Uncle Sam need to step in if the market could just always correct itself?\n\nAren't most regulations created for a very good reason?  Sure, some laws get a little silly, but in general telling companies not to dump toxic waste into the rivers seems like a good idea, no?

The first two categorize political ideologies based on the guiding principles of libertarian political philosophy. The third is an illustration which amends the first into taking the shape of a three dimensional Egyptian pyramid of sorts and shows how to understand where the Alt-Right falls on the political spectrum. The first two images serve as cross sectional cuts of this pyramid. The 4th and 5th images illustrate how the terms left/right are conflated with liberal/conservative in addition to deriving the underlying conceptualizations of property and individual rights inherent to differing categories of political ideology as well as how these ideologies manifest themselves as a government structure or political system. These last two drawings are loosely based off of Aristotle's conceptualization of political forms.\n\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\n\nI also have [several YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyVKLxfrbLjtm8gd2VlK6l92LDBxQr-Ev) explaining how to read these diagrams in further detail.\n\n\n***Some Notes*** The terms in these charts are approximations of the language people use to describe different political ideologies. The categorical placement of these ideologies is fundamentally relative to one another. Many people object to the placement of neo-liberalism as left wing. I categorize neo-liberals as left wing because they are interventionist, corporatist, in favor of central banking and bank bailouts, and of government control of the money supply. Many people also object to my use of the term \"marxism.\" I am defining \"marxism\" in the abstract to describe political systems and ideologies characterized by a framework of oppressor vs oppressed and property and rights being products of collective will.\n\n\nCommunism is Marxism where an oppressed majority (the proletariat) forcibly subjugate/eradicate a dominant minority (the bourgeoisie). Fascism is \"marxism\" where a dominant majority (the nazi regime) forcibly subjugate/eradicate an oppressed minority (the Jews). In Communism the bourgeoisie surrender their property in accordance with the will of the people. Likewise in Nazism the Jews and other minorities are systematically murdered in accordance with the will of the Nazi Party, the government of the people. Communism is \"Marxism\" and F/fascism is \"marxism\" in the same way that \"6\" and \"9\" are both categorically \"6-shaped\" letters, roughly speaking.","subreddit":"JordanPeterson","title":"The Political Spectrum, Jordan Peterson, And The \"Alt-Right\" (Jordan Peterson Is Not \"Alt-Right,\" And Here's Why...

The electoral college is there to provide a voice to the States in who will preside over the Union.

{"author":"Dr_Jorge","created_utc":1525788325,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"The past two weeks we presented and assessed the Israel-Palestine difference. A long standing TERRITORIAL DISPUTE with local, regional and international issues at stake. Although Israel is a sovereign state de jure and de facto there is still tension with Palestine, a de facto sovereign state, over some territories. The most notable, Jerusalem, sees a city divided in zones. Gaza and the West Bank are volatile. Forced migration, fight, arm trafficking, terrorism, children without parents, are many of the consequences. The status quo is self-contradictory. \n\nThis blog series I called TERRITORIAL DISPUTES offers an open platform for discussion. As with the previous reviewed disputes, post 1 introduced very broadly the context and the parties. Posts 2, 3, and 4 presented the views in Israel and Palestine by including academic and non-academic sources with the intention to show there are different perceptions about this conflict amongst the three main parties and within each of them. Post 5 departs from the methodology used to assess previous TERRITORIAL DISPUTES (so far Kashmir, the Falkland/Malvinas islands and Gibraltar) and instead of introducing directly the EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY as a means to solve the issue, this time we centre the attention on determining WHO counts. That is to say, who can be considered a legitimate party in this sovereignty dispute. I introduce the concept of \"colourable claim\" to answer the question. This week the posts will examine this and other points in more detail.  Posts 6 to 9 introduced the different grounds for a colourable claim: historical entitlement,  legal basis and moral standing. Post 10 brings the analysis of the Israel-Palestine difference to an open conclusion: there is room for a peaceful and permanent solution if there is will to achieve one. Yet, the will to solve this difference is questionable. Some leaders seems to focus more on personal agenda and political gain than people living in turmoil. \n\nA reminder to the reader, this is a series I called TERRITORIAL DISPUTES. I introduced basic conceptual elements and thereafter, I apply a theoretical frame (based on Rawlsian methodology) to solve well-known sovereignty disputes or conflicts. I explore what reasonable people would do in a territorial dispute. This is a theoretical experiment that deals with IDEAL theory only. There is no claim to NON IDEAL theory hence issues like lack of compliance are not explored.\n\nIn order to do it, I assume the representatives of each claiming party (sovereign States and a non-sovereign character) choose a rule based on theory game. I go for the maximin. From there, these ideal people come up with a solution to the conflict. \n\nREMINDER Note: I\u2019ll only post on r/Libertarian on Tuesday a summary of what I do weekly on the blog to avoid spamming this sub-reedit as that is not my intention. I only aim to open a healthy discussion.\n\nNote: I was going to start today with a new case study (Crimea). I've received a comment from a reader and I've decided to explore how the EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY can apply to the Israel-Palestine difference. Hence, the assessment of this case study is extended a few more posts. Once we finish this, we'll move onto reviewing Crimea, Russia and Ukraine. \n\nComments welcomed. Guest writers would be hugely appreciated. As you may see from the posts I don't take sides and I do this with utmost respect to all people involved. I'd appreciate the same respect in the discussion. I don't claim to have the solution. As I've just mention, I only aim to offer an open floor for discussion.

Ive spent the last year intensely reading about economics and politics which opened my eyes to my own ignorance and reshaped my views. Once I read about Libertarianism, I was instantly drawn to it. It is a great feeling to have a sense of clarity on what is actually going on in the political and economical environment. But I still feel a bit lost when it comes to the question...What now? So I've come to you guys for some advice.\n\nI think the separation of state and economy is as important as the separation of the state and the church. It should be something of a main focus in our society and I would love to see the majority of people adopt more libertarian values. It seems more and more everyday, governments impede on our freedoms. I think we can all agree that big government is too involved in our lives and that taxation is indeed theft. We need to bring back the free market and have limited government. But how can we, the libertarian community go about this? At some point it will HAVE to happen. How many more boom and bust cycles can our economy handle before it is too much, how much more public debt do we have to accumulate before people realize there is no turning back? Is it going to be one of those things where the people will wake up when it is too late? Or can there actually be a unified movement of the people to restore the free market and the rights and freedoms of individuals. In my opinion, it looks like a long and bumpy road, but definitely possible with small steps. \n\nThe ultimate goal is of course a free market, and limited, if not, no government at all. But how willing is the state to limit its own power? How willing is the state to implement voluntary taxation? (Haha!) From my observation, it doesn't seem to be their priority. Only the unification of the people pushing for this can make it happen. But it seems lately with the current political atmosphere, people are becoming more divided and are blind the some of the real issues at hand!  \n\nAnyway thanks for your time, I would love to read some of the sort of things you guys have done when you reached this stage and what sort of steps you think need to happen in order for the libertarian movement to make an impact.

However Libertarians believe that the government is wildly inefficient at providing these kinds of services itself.

So if I were filling out my taxes there would be a little section where I could put the charity or non profit organization that would receive my tax dollars.  Obviously it's not a perfect solution as it requires coercion, but it encourages market competition between charities who are much more capable and efficient at spending the money than the government while maintaining that a certain amount of money is guaranteed to go towards social benefit.

I assume they are making the thing for the US military since it's funded with US money.\n\nBut what about when Boeing sells a thing to Saudi Arabia? Do they make that privately with their own private industry money or do they get DoD awards to make the things they sell to Saudi Arabia?\n\nAnd if these are sold privately- just between Boeing and Saudi Arabia for example- then how does Trump factor in to this, brokering these deals?

Wouldn't it just be easier if the smart people (technocracy) or one *very smart leader* and possibly some advisors of his (autocracy) would rule everyone else? Why even bother with some voting charade? *\"No, no, no! That would be totalitarian and that's bad.\"*\n\nAnyway what I wanted to ask is what do libertarians (and possibly other people in this sub) think about this \"People are stupid.\" statement and if you don't agree with it what do you think is the cause of people saying such things. If you do however what would you see as the solution to this?\n\nAlso I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes I may have made. If you find any I would appreciate it if you let me know so I can correct them.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"\"Majority of people is stupid.\""}

{"author":"truthbomb_ISIS","created_utc":1525891126,"num_comments":26,"score":1,"selftext":"Hi! New to this sub. I live in India, and have been very much influenced by populism(the civic nationalist type).\nI believe in \"country first\", where in foreign policy, maintain good relations with all countries but don't interfere in their affairs. I believe, in a George Washington sense, that alliances are overrated, even though global exchanges are good.\n\nSpeaking of global exchanges, I believe arbitrary punitive tariffs are bad, but \"free trade\" best works bilaterally and all trade should be proportional. At the same time, companies should NOT be allowed to look for cheap labor in foreign countries, doesn't matter if goods are more expensive.\n\nOn immigration, i believe that less, highly vetted and skills based immigration helps maintain social cohesion, and prevents hyper rapid demographic change(gives time for assimilation), which also, in turn, may prevent racism and xenophobia against good, hardworking immigrants. \n\"Immigrants are good for the economy\" applies to mostly corporations and may make goods cheaper, but AT LEAST in the short term, jobs go to immigrants who are usually willing to work for less(I'm Indian, so I know how H1B visa works and how Indian tech companies and workers game the system).\n\nOutsourcing of labor destroys and disrupts communities and lead to sudden job losses. Literally none of the \"job retraining\" programs have worked since decades. If free markets are supposed to be \"each according to his ability\", do people deserve unfair competition from LITERAL slave labor from China and Bangladesh, where labor rights are abysmal or non existent? \n\nI understand most job losses are due to automation, and upgrading of the education system and skills is a need of our time, so I favor skills programs and trade schools(college for STEM and liberal arts optional, not as majors). Also, if you bring up automation, isn't this is an argument AGAINST low skilled immigration as most low skilled jobs are gonna be gone and the new migrants would have to be dependent on welfare?\n\nEDIT: Posting a couple of links for quick reference: \nhttps://amgreatness.com/2018/03/14/why-ben-shapiro-is-wrong-on-free-trade/\n\nhttps://amgreatness.com/2018/03/19/yes-ben-shapiro-is-still-wrong-on-tariffs-heres-why/\n\n\nEDIT 2 : \"A 2002 paper by Stephen Redding of the\u00a0London School of Economics\u00a0found that economic growth is contingent upon technological innovation, and is therefore\u00a0path-dependent. In other words, the majority of economic growth occurred in those industries most likely to generate or benefit from new technology, and that these industries build on those which came before. They are\u00a0predicate industries, which could not exist without their respective\u00a0anchor industries.\"\n\nEDIT 3: \"Tariffs are antithetical to big government because they preclude socialism. How? Tariffs make imports expensive. This encourages domestic production and discourages offshoring\u2014thereby boosting demand for American labor. Basically, tariffs create stable jobs and increase wages for American workers. Further, because labor-intensive industries are the first to be offshored, as\u00a0economist Ian Fletcher notes, tariffs inevitably protect more jobs than free trade generates.\"\n\n\"How can American businesses compete against China\u2019s monolithic government? They can\u2019t. Nor can they compete with Germany\u2019s feudal-industrial system, nor Japan\u2019s\u00a0keiretsus. Those who demand free international trade must recognize that tariffs are not the only impediment\u2014different legal structures, business models, and economic philosophies preclude free trade and guarantee that liberal \u201cfree traders\u201d will get\u00a0screwed.\n\nThis explains why\u00a0all successful historical economies adopted economic nationalism, as opposed to liberalism, as their\u00a0modus operandi. History shows us that any time a nation embraced free trade, said nation was plundered by foreign nations. For example, free-trading Britain was\u00a0flooded with artificially cheap German goods at the end of the 19th century. This undermined British businesses and deprived them of the capital they needed to expand. British industry starved, economic growth plummeted, unemployment increased, and Britain lost her status as the first among nations. What is currently happening to America is eerily similar, and it\u2019s no coincidence, it\u2019s just what happens when the hammer becomes the nail.\"\n\nEDIT 4: It would be great if people engage on immigration and Foreign policy as well, instead of just trade. Thanks!\n\nEDIT 5: Why the downvotes?\n\n\nChange my mind.\n\n\nTLDR: Foreign Alliances are overrated(George Washington was right), immigration should be restricted for practical reasons, Trade should be proportional and fair, and community cohesion is more important than \"immigrants are good for economy\" and \"cheap goods\".","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I am a populist(change my mind) [Posted in /neoliberal, copypasting here cause I got downvoted simply for presenting my opinion]"}

I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.\n\n\u201cBad news, detective. We got a situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWorse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars\u2019 worth of bitcoins.\u201d\n\nThe heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. \u201cWhat kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet. But mark my words: we\u2019re going to figure out who did this and we\u2019re going to take them down \u2026 provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy, chief,\u201d I said. \u201cAny rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.\u201d\nHe laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d\n\nI put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office \nbuilding, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.\n\u201cHome Depot\u2122 Presents the Police!\u00ae\u201d I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. \u201cNobody move unless you want to!\u201d They didn\u2019t.\n\u201cNow, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?\u201d No one spoke up.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?\u201d\nIt didn\u2019t seem like they did.\n\n\u201cSeriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I\u2019m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.\u201d\n\nNothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn\u2019t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.\nI figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.\n\n\u201cSubway\u2122 Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!\u00ae\u201d I yelled.\nToo late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.\n\u201cStop right there!\u201d I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.\n\nI was losing him. \u201cListen, I\u2019ll pay you to stop!\u201d I yelled. \u201cWhat would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I\u2019ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn \u2018Bob Barr \u201808\u2019 extra-large long-sleeved men\u2019s T-shirt!\u201d\nHe turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right!\u201d the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. \u201cI give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201d I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos\u2122 Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs\u00ae on the guy.\n\u201cBecause I was afraid.\u201d\n\u201cAfraid?\u201d\n\u201cAfraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a central banker.\u201d\nI wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.\n\n\u201cLet this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,\u201d I said. \u201cNo matter how many bitcoins you steal, you\u2019ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.\u201d\nHe nodded, because he knew I was right.

I don\u2019t even know why white people were blamed for this, as none of the parties in the Trayvon Martin killings were white. George Zimmerman was from Spain and is one of those Cuban people. Trayvon Martin was a negro, not a bad guy, but he didn\u2019t know his place and didn\u2019t have respect for authority. When a cop tells you to get your hands out of your pockets, you shut the fuck up and do what he says. Cops put their lives on the line every fucking day to maintain law and order so the rest of us can be safe, and Obama treats them like shit. That\u2019s fucked up.\n\nIt was nice talking to y\u2019all, but I gotta go fuck my sister/wife.

{"author":"rpl_fx","created_utc":1526135790,"num_comments":13,"score":0,"selftext":"Rothbard said that parents owe their children nothing, not even the essentials of life \\(food, clothing, shelter, etc.\\), so if they want to let the child die, it's their right to do so.\n\nSo then, if a man impregnates a woman and then kicks her to the curb, she and the kid are on their own. Likewise, if he wants her to stay and raise the kid with him, but she leaves him and takes the kid, he has no obligation to pay for their support.\n\nI'm thinking, one effect of this is that a man who has a lot of romantic options would be less reluctant to dump the mother of his child, because there would be no consequence for doing so; he could just get some other woman \\(e.g. maybe \"trade up\" for a younger woman\\). On the other hand, a woman who has a lot of romantic options would be more reluctant to leave the father of her kid, because she wouldn't be able to make that man pay for their kid's support after they've moved on to some other man.\n\nSo it would encourage some different mate choices, e.g. it would encourage women to seek men with few romantic options \\(aka betas\\) and encourage men to seek women who aren't all that attractive compared to them and would be less likely to leave them. So both sexes would want to \"date down\" for reasons of wanting to have relationship security. Yet they can't both simultaneously be dating down.\n\nUnder our current, non\\-Rothbardian child support system, the men with a lot of romantic options are restrained from just abandoning their families, but on the other hand, women with a lot of romantic options are not restrained from abandoning the fathers of their kids to go be with other men, while making the fathers pay for the support of kids they never get to see.\n\nNow, some would say, \"That's a feature, not a bug. Men should be required to pay support for kids they never get to see; that's just the risk you take when you're a man who fathers a kid. The natural order is that, unless the mother prefers a different arrangement, the mother take care of their kids while the father pays for the kids' support, regardless of whether the two parents are still together. Obviously, if a man had been a good partner to the mother of his kid, she would not have wanted to leave him, so it's his fault anyway that he ended up in that situation of having to pay child support.\"\n\nThey will say, \"It's better for the kids if the couple breaks up, with the father being required to pay child support, than for the kid to have to listen to his parents fighting all the time.\" Of course, a third option is for the father to simply not fight; he can submit to the mother of his child and retreat from conflict back to his man\\-cave, to maintain peace for the good of the family. And I think there are many fathers who do exactly that. They set up a fence, essentially, so they can be good neighbors and \"equal partners\" in the same home by minimizing their interaction with each other; they sleep in separate bedrooms, and maybe she cheats on him with other men when he's not looking; but he continues to pay the bills for the household, so that their kid will not have to grow up without his dad.\n\nSome might say, \"Child support isn't a system that's inherently biased against men, because some women pay child support too\" but that's like saying, \"There's no gender pay gap, because some women get paid more than men\" or \"The drug laws aren't racist, because some whites get busted for dealing crack too.\"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"What do you think about Rothbard's view that fathers should not be required to pay any child support?"}

I would like to share my answer. \n\nLibertarianism is built on one single idea: the non-aggression principle (NAP). NAP is the cornerstone of any platform or rhetoric of libertarianism. The initiation of force to achieve a goal is strongly opposed by libertarians; however, once aggression has been started, the natural right of self-defense takes over. \n\nThis principle has been taught all over the nation for generations. Sometimes it is called the \u201cGolden Rule\u201d, or in other words, \u201cdo unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u201d It is also known as the \u201cGood Neighbor Policy.\u201d\n\nSimilar to many of you, when I was growing up, I was expected not to cheat, lie, steal, or hit others unless I was hit first. This natural order of society is a direct correlation of the NAP. \n\nToday, we have allowed the government to be the aggressor in our communities. It takes through taxation to fund its crony projects and its endless expansion. It enforces unnecessary regulations and rules through physical threats and imprisonment.

And to be fair, I mostly skin my feed and don't dive to deep into things most of the time. But I feel like we could currate the content a little better while still being hands off and free speech promoting.\n\nIf we have the option of flairing a post people can filter based off of those flairs. People who don't want the memes (even though that's what r/libertarianmemes is for) can filter them out. Either by filtering out those posts with the meme flair, or excluding un-flaired posts. We are all for voluntary interaction, this would just help people do that. You want memes, fine, leave everything unfiltered. You want serious discussion, you now have the ability to mute the memers so you can interact with the people you are wanting to interact with much easier.

{"author":"Dr_Jorge","created_utc":1526385195,"num_comments":0,"score":3,"selftext":"NOTE to the reader: I was going to introduce a new case study (Crimea) this week. However, after receiving a comment from a reader of the series, I have decided to extend the analysis of the Israel-Palestine difference in order to apply the Egalitarian Shared Sovereignty. The series TERRITORIAL DISPUTES will cover Crimea, Russia and Ukraine once we finish this assessment.\n\nWith the previous cases covered by the series TERRITORIAL DISPUTES (Kashmir, the Falkland/Malvinas islands, and Gibraltar) we explored an ideal solution called EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY in what has to do with population, territory, government and law.\n\nThe Israel-Palestine difference did not follow that approach. Why? Because before going into any negotiations we had to determine who may be a legitimate party. That issue maintains the Israel-Palestine difference in a\u00a0status quo. The claiming parties do not recognise reciprocally complete legitimacy to go into any negotiations about the disputed territories.\n\nWith all this in mind, and assuming that Israel and Palestine have finally decided to settle the difference by applying the EGALITARIAN SHARED this week we will assess how it can work in relation to people, territory,  government and law.\n\nThe posts (links) below introduce the basis for the thought experiment. \n\nREMINDER:\nThis is a series I called TERRITORIAL DISPUTES. I introduced basic conceptual elements and thereafter, I apply a theoretical frame (based on Rawlsian methodology) to solve well-known sovereignty disputes or conflicts. I explore what reasonable people would do in a territorial dispute. This is a theoretical experiment that deals with IDEAL theory only. There is no claim to NON IDEAL theory hence issues like lack of compliance are not explored.\n\nIn order to do it, I assume the representatives of each claiming party (sovereign States and a non-sovereign character) choose a rule based on theory game. I go for the maximin. From there, these ideal people come up with a solution to the conflict. \n\nI\u2019ll only post on r/Libertarian on Tuesday a summary of what I do weekly on the blog to avoid spamming this sub-reedit as that is not my intention. I only aim to open a healthy discussion.\n\nCOMMENTS welcomed. GUEST WRITERS would be hugely appreciated. As you may see from the posts I don't take sides and I do this with utmost respect to all people involved. I'd appreciate the same respect in the discussion. I don't claim to have the solution. As I've just mention, I only aim to offer an open floor for discussion. Enjoy!\n\nPost 11\nhttp://london1701.blogspot.co.uk/2018/05/territorial-disputes-israel-palestine_7.html?m=1\n\nPost 12\nhttp://london1701.blogspot.co.uk/2018/05/territorial-disputes-israel-palestine_8.html?m=1\n\nPost 13\nhttp://london1701.blogspot.co.uk/2018/05/territorial-disputes-israel-palestine_9.html?m=1\n\nPost 14\nhttp://london1701.blogspot.co.uk/2018/05/territorial-disputes-israel-palestine_10.html?m=1\n\nPost 15\nhttp://london1701.blogspot.co.uk/2018/05/territorial-disputes-israel-palestine_11.html?m=1\n\nRegards.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Territorial disputes: the Israel-Palestine difference"}

{"author":"Tsaranon","created_utc":1526398415,"num_comments":18,"score":24,"selftext":"For those of you who aren't aware, internally the Department of Defense Office of the Inspector General announced that in 2015 there was $6.5 trillion in spending that was unaccounted for by documentation. This was independently verified by economics professors. Further, from the years of 1998-2015 the number appears to be $21 trillion. Some of that may just be from lost documentation, but it's worth mentioning that congressional budgeting for the DoD in 2015 was $120 billion, which puts the unaccounted for spending alone to be 54 times more than the legally allotted amount. The DoD spent and subsequently lost, or never had in the first place, its receipts for more money than the UK as a whole generated that same year.\n\nI've held for a while now that the government shouldn't be touching the budget for defense spending until a full and proper audit has been completed and discussions could be held about the cost-benefit analysis of the various programs the DoD controls. Every time I discuss this with others, their wide eyed stares for having an opinion other than \"we don't spend enough\" or \"we spend way too much\" is disturbing to me. My congresspeople, when I propose similar things to them, don't respond with anything more than a scripted response if at all. This disturbs me even more given that I've always lived in red districts and I'd hoped that principles that mirror business practices, and appealing to the idea of restrained and carefully monitored government spending would appeal to the Republicans that held seats in my districts. \n\nThis is scandalously, dangerously bad for the DoD and government as a whole. Spending is coming out of nowhere, and breaking constitutional law in the process by going over budget without congressional approval. This could potentially lead to a huge inflation to the dollar too, as suddenly the world discovers there's a lot more of it floating around than the US government said there was. \n\nAs the auditing process begins to turn over more and more frankly infuriating abuses and fiscal irresponsibility, I'm left to find a crowd that might hear me out. I realize that the population here may not be the most influential, but if the libertarian community could rally around this issue, and bring it forward to the national platform and force people to talk about it, that would be an amazing win. \n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The $21 trillion in lost defense spending"}

{"author":"therightideas","created_utc":1526445091,"num_comments":8,"score":3,"selftext":"Education is hugely wasteful. People often ask 'how would education be funded in a private society?' and in its current state I think it probably wouldn't be. Because the average person has been removed from the cost of these services it has allowed them to become incredibly wasteful. \n\nThis isn't confined to colleges either, secondary education is incredibly wasteful. I will be talking mostly from a UK perspective as I suspect those from across the pond have differing systems. \n\nOne obvious example of wasteful spending is P.E, or gym as I expect Americans would call it. Why keep kids in school for an hour, where they require supervision, equipment etc, when they could simply be let out an hour earlier and play in the park like most kids do when left to their own devices. Kits are a huge waste of money for parents when any other form of clothing is usually perfectly fine for a kid to play in. Forcing kids to do sports in an hour (a lot of which gets eaten up by changing and registers, setting up etc), then expecting them to be focused in a lesson is a ridiculous idea. Especially in hot weather, or when its wet.\n\nThe cost of maintaining this equipment, building gyms and pitches etc uses valuable money that could be spent in other areas. Kids don't need P.E to get exercise, this should be the job of parents. \n\nDrama, another relatively pointless subject. I never gained any useful skills from it. It was time that I could have been spending learning skills I was interested in or simply socialising. Music is a similar story. Due to class sizes it was never an actual learning experience, the relatively small time you got to play an instrument was rather pointless without guided tutoring. Kids who did want to learn music mostly did it outside of lessons anyways. \n\nTo anyone who does not understand the British system, at age 11 kids start secondary school. This begins in year 7 and continues until year 11. Year 11 ends in qualifications called GCSE's, basically you general certificates for maths, english and other subjects you choose. After that you do A-levels for 2 years (or attend 'college', basically vocational qualifications), which are your university entry qualifications essentially. \n\nFrom year 7-10 students are required to do all subjects in school. Subjects like design and technology (wood working etc), cooking, drama, foreign languages, religious/ethics, history and art. The majority of these are pointless for the average student. Drama is of no use outside a small minority of students, art is another such subject. Most people do not choose these subjects once they get to GCSE. \n\nThe amount of time a student spends taking in unnecessary material is incredibly high. The amount of time and resources dedicated to these 'lessons' are ridiculous. Kids would be far better served by having more free time, not being confined around other kids, many of whom are bad influences. \n\nEducation at this point largely serves as publicly funded day care. I would like to see schooling cut by half. My vision for education would be kids going in to learn maths and English for a few hours, along with some other important subjects mixed in, then being free to leave and use their time freely. Kids who want to do extra activities (art, drama, music) could do them at school, without the influence of those who are forced to be their, are with far more resources and teacher attention available. \n\nThe additional benefits to kids is that they would not be stuck in an area that if often hostile to them. Essentially forcing kids into the playground hierarchies and forcing them to associate with undesirables is unproductive if your goal is to produce well rounded citizens. The amount of bullying and abuse that would be removed is a huge benefit. In the real world you can simply disassociate with those who are abusive, in a school you are forced into a room with them, you are forced onto a playground with them or into a cafeteria with them. \n\nThere is simply no reason to keep children in school for 6+ hours a day and I think we'd be producing far more able citizens if we used this time more wisely.

This time we're raising money for the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/Default.aspx) again, an organization that works to distribute insecticide-treated bed nets in the developing world to combat malaria.  This charity was chosen in accordance with [effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism) principles - doing the absolute most good possible with the dollars we donate.  AMF is widely regarded as one of the most (if not *the* most) effective charity in the world in terms of impact per dollar spent.  AMF has received the 'Top Charity' rating from [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities) in five of the last six years, as well as 'Top Charity' ratings from [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/giving-recommendations/) and [The Life You Can Save](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/best-charities) for six years running. \n\nSome malaria facts:\n\n&gt;Malaria kills nearly half a million people every year and more than 200 million fall ill. Before bed nets were made available, it was many times that. Nets are a proven intervention - a more effective a way of saving lives than any other. \n\n&gt;* 70% of the deaths are children under 5\n* Malaria is the world's single largest killer of pregnant women\n* 90% of the deaths are in sub-Saharan Africa\n\n&gt;Yet malaria is totally preventable and treatable. Nobody need die. Prevention is better than treatment.\n\n&gt;* The most effective means of prevention is sleeping under a mosquito net\n* Specifically a Long-Lasting Insecticide treated Net (LLIN)\n* Each net costs about two US dollars ($2)\n\nMalaria is one of the largest causes of human suffering in the world and *we can prevent it*.  At a rough approximation every 1000 nets saves a life, and prevents dozens of others from the misery of contracting malaria.  And it's an economic issue too - malaria acts as a drag on economic activity and actively impoverishes the third world. Every dollar towards malaria prevention leads to [12 dollars in economic gain](http://earth.columbia.edu/sitefiles/file/about/director/pubs/sachsmalariafeb02.pdf).  \n\nAll donations are anonymous if desired, and for a great cause.  Donate today!\n\n---------------------------------\n\n#***[CLICK HERE](https://www.AgainstMalaria.com/Libertarian2018) to donate to the Against Malaria Foundation***\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"/r/Libertarian fights Malaria - donating only $2 helps make a difference."}

Full of real-world examples of how screwed up the public sector is. \n\nThe first chapter talks about Subway workers, Janitors, etc. And how they make ridiculous money and abuse the system at the expense of the taxpayer. \n\nThis chapter was super interesting and I thought I could give some insight since I'm in the private sector of this field. (sorta)\n\nI work for UPS and I'm part of the Teamsters Union. The workers in this book are also in the Teamsters Union but in the public side. So we share some similarities. This helped me to see the corruption and inefficient management on the public side and it outraged me.\n\nAt UPS\n\n- Diver wage is 37.25/he and roughly $50/he ovetime. I made roughly 85k last year.\n\n- Overtime is accrued at time and a half past 8 hrs in a day. Holiday pay is double time or triple time.\n\n- We get 6 weeks paid vacation 1 week non paid\n\n- Benefits are amazing. Never had to pay for anything other than a $10 copay. \n\nAll of these benefits are pretty similar to what is offered to public workers who are also teamsters. \n\nBut because of corruption and terrible management you have employees working the system to make 200k+ a year as janitors, city bus drivers etc. And in top of this I believe the book mentioned (MTA)  lost 6 billion dollars last year. These loses are then offset by govt officials putting fees in utilities such as water, gas, phones, etc. \n\nOn the flip side here at UPS we have almost no corruption where drivers are making over 100k a year. The only way you make that much is if you work 60hr a week. And to put a cherry on top UPS made 18.87Billion in Q4 2017 alone. \n\nGranted I see the industies are not exactly the same.

I'm sure this number isn't enormous, but I think it is non-zero, and, as someone swaying from liberalism to libertarianism, I wanted some libertarian's opinions about the size of this group of people. There's some background below if you want, but that is the question - how many people are libertarians, but don't realize it? \n\n\n This idea came to mind when I was talking to my Republican/conservative family members (who are also Christian). As a then self-identifying liberal, I was talking to them about a variety of social issues - such as gay marriage, the BLM movement, transgender people, etc. Rather than give the typical conservative response (some sort of religious or traditional appeal) they really just said something along the lines of \"I don't care what they do, as long as they don't try and shove it down my throat.\" In other words, they expressed that they don't really care what other people do as long as they don't infringe on others' autonomy/freedom. With respect to BLM, race relations, &amp; welfare, they simply expressed that they felt that some people don't deserve a lot of help because they put themselves in their situation through their own choices and free will - they are responsible, not us. These seemed to me like libertarian, not conservative, responses to these social issues. Regardless of whether I'm right or wrong here (i.e., that they were giving libertarian responses), I think my question still stands. \n\n\n Why do I think this question is important? If more people *realized* they were libertarian, it would be significantly easier to deconstruct our two-party system and increase political diversity, and elect libertarian candidates. This could ease political tension and increase progress. Political ideology is usually measured as political *identification*, not by giving people some sort of values/issue stance test to determine their position. This might artificially deflate the estimated # of libertarians, because people identify as being not libertarian when they *actually* are if you go by their values and issues stances.

This time we're raising money for the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/Default.aspx) again, an organization that works to distribute insecticide-treated bed nets in the developing world to combat malaria.  This charity was chosen in accordance with [effective altruism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism) principles - doing the absolute most good possible with the dollars we donate.  AMF is widely regarded as one of the most (if not *the* most) effective charity in the world in terms of impact per dollar spent.  AMF has received the 'Top Charity' rating from [GiveWell](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities) in five of the last six years, as well as 'Top Charity' ratings from [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/giving-recommendations/) and [The Life You Can Save](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/best-charities) for six years running. \n\nSome malaria facts:\n\n&gt;Malaria kills nearly half a million people every year and more than 200 million fall ill. Before bed nets were made available, it was many times that. Nets are a proven intervention - a more effective a way of saving lives than any other. \n\n&gt;* 70% of the deaths are children under 5\n* Malaria is the world's single largest killer of pregnant women\n* 90% of the deaths are in sub-Saharan Africa\n\n&gt;Yet malaria is totally preventable and treatable. Nobody need die. Prevention is better than treatment.\n\n&gt;* The most effective means of prevention is sleeping under a mosquito net\n* Specifically a Long-Lasting Insecticide treated Net (LLIN)\n* Each net costs about two US dollars ($2)\n\nMalaria is one of the largest causes of human suffering in the world and *we can prevent it*.  At a rough approximation every 1000 nets saves a life, and prevents dozens of others from the misery of contracting malaria.  And it's an economic issue too - malaria acts as a drag on economic activity and actively impoverishes the third world. Every dollar towards malaria prevention leads to [12 dollars in economic gain](http://earth.columbia.edu/sitefiles/file/about/director/pubs/sachsmalariafeb02.pdf).  \n\nAll donations are anonymous if desired, and for a great cause.

For example, if you legalize incest, it maximizes liberty for those southerners that want to fuck their relatives, but it is extremely harmful for society. This view of incest is backed up by history, the European royal bloodline had major health problems with hemophilia due to inbreeding, and it led to a retard known as King Charles the 2nd being the ruler of Spain, and due to his retardation he was unfit to lead, and  there was a power struggle over who would take charge. Where there is little to no genetic variation, the risk of inheriting genetic diseases increases, which leads to more retards and cripples that are a drain on the system, costing money. Libertarians choose to ignore all this in favor of the individual, but if you do a cost benefit analysis, the well being of the 99.9% of us that don\u2019t engage in incest is more important than the liberty of those who do engage in incest. Some people are harmful to the structure of society, and the most efficient way to deal with them is to round them up and send them to a gulag. We don\u2019t need any justice system. If you are accused of being a killer, it is better to kill a few innocents here and there and save money on trial costs, prison costs, etc than to let murders go free and have them kill more people. No need for a trial or any of that bullshit, if you are accused of murder or any crime against the government, you are a drain on society and therefore should just be killed.

The right of secession is the final safeguard against federal and state tyranny and an essential political right in a free society. A libertarian constitution would have to be a contract between the peoples of all states, and each state should have the right to freely withdraw from the Union. Furthermore, as the federal government exists to serve the needs of the people and the states, Congress should be completely excluded from the amendment procedure. People of any state should be able to ratify any amendment they desire and ask other states to do the same. I believe the ratification threshold is too high and that it should be lowered from 3/4 of states to 2/3 of states. But the federal character of the Union and the right of secession should be declared fundamental to the libertarian political order and unamendable.\n\n**The problem of imperial presidency** - in the two centuries since the constitution was enacted, the position and influence of the President has grown to imperial proportions. The President today is surrounded by an almost monarchical \"court\" of various bureaucrats, administrators and officials and is treated like a king. The Presidency should be abolished and replaced with an executive council of 7-12 people tasked with administering the various parts of the federal government. The White House should be turned into a museum and this Council should be housed somewhere in the Capitol, right next to Congress. Let me quote the suprisingly prescient Anti-Federalist Paper No. 74:\n\n*A conspiracy against the freedom of America, both deep and dangerous, has been formed by an infernal junta of demagogues. Our thirteen free commonwealths are to be consolidated into one despotic monarchy. Is not this position obvious? Its evidence is intuitive . . . . Who can deny but the president general will be a king to all intents and purposes, and one of the most dangerous kind too a king elected to command a standing army. Thus our laws are to be administered by this tyrant; for the whole, or at least the most important part of the executive department is put in his hands.*\n\n**The Congress, a real piece of work** - The House of Representatives needs to be overhauled completely. It should be a mixed-member proportional assembly, meaning you still elect your representatives, but if a party has less representatives than it share of the vote would suggest, the party gains additional seats in order to make the assembly proportional. The representatives themselves should be elected through score voting (meaning you don't vote for anyone, but instead give every candidate a numerical score), because the method relays much more information about voter preferences than first past the post. The electoral districts should not be drawn by the politicians but by independent bodies. Members of the Senate should be elected and dismissed by state legislatures - the Senate should be a safeguard of federalism. \n\n**Poltical influence on the Supreme Court** - the Supreme Court, being the body which ultimately decides what the constitution says, has become the guardian of the entire American legal system, and yet, politicians elect its members and determine how many justices there are on the Court. This raises the possibility of court packing - flooding the court with ideological zealots in order to subvert and control its decisions. This may seem politically impossible now, but polarization has been on the rise for decades - what happens when one side decides that stopping the other is more important than maintaining judicial independence and the rule of law? The simple solution is to constitutionally fix the number of justices at 9 and remove the possibility of packing completely. Perhaps you Americans could also consider a more radical reform - have the Supreme Court justices be appointed from a larger pool of elected justices, by the means of lottery. Whoever is elected to the pool stays in the pool until they die, resign or are removed. Entire court should be reshuffled every few months. The exact ideological composition of the court would vary radically throught the year.\n\n**Eminent domain and civil forfeiture** - civil forfeiture should be banned outright and eminent domain should be either greately limited or abolished as well. Forfeiture encourages unethical behavior by law enforcement and is completely contrary to the fundamental rights like due process necessary for a just society. If assets have been involved in criminal behavior, let this be proven in a court of law instead of assuming guilt. Eminent domain unfairly targets the poor and vulnerable (since they are often incapable of defending themselves in court while the rich can hire hordes of lawyers and tend to be very well connected) and it enables crony capitalism - enrichment of the already rich at the expense of society at large. \n\nWhat are your criticisms?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"What are your criticisms of the US constitution?"}

Even within the United States, all political parties other than our own grant to government the right to regulate the lives of individuals and seize the fruits of their labor without their consent.\n\nReal Libertarians, on the contrary, deny the right of any government to do these things, and hold that where governments exist, they must not violate the rights of any individual: namely, \\(1\\) the right to life\u2014accordingly Real Libertarians support the prohibition of the initiation of physical force against others; \\(2\\) the right to liberty of speech and action\u2014accordingly Real Libertarians oppose all attempts by government to abridge the freedom of speech and press, as well as government censorship in any form; and \\(3\\) the right to property\u2014accordingly Real Libertarians oppose all government interference with private property, such as confiscation, nationalization, and eminent domain, and support the prohibition of robbery, trespass, fraud, and misrepresentation.\n\nSince governments, when instituted, must not violate individual rights, Real Libertarians oppose all interference by government in the areas of voluntary and contractual relations among individuals.

Instead, help to turn it around! We can argue about how small to shrink the government when we can get it to stop *growing.* \n\nIf they do not, don't waste your time arguing with them. Instead, try to **convert them.** \n\nDon't make enemies of your opponents!\n\n&gt;If you use the analogy of a train, some people will say that minarchists are on a train to New York, while anarchists are on a train to Los Angeles.

Lately a lot of leftists came into this sub and we are all arguing about misdefined words, so let me give you my best and simplest definitions of concepts so that we can clear up any misunderstanding.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Person** n. = The essence of yourself, either a soul or your mind or whatever you believe to be. It's the subjective experience how you view your life. Everything other than yourself is an object by your point of view and it's either another person or a property (animals and plants included). The threshold of difference between persons and property is just the level of consciousness it inhibits.\n\n*Ex: John is a person.* \n\n*Ex: A cat is a property.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Society** n. = A large group of persons (individuals) referred to in aggregate.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Property** n. = An object apart from yourself (person) that is morally linked to you. A property was either created by you or was legitimately obtained via trade where the other party voluntarily gave up it's posession of it in exchange for something else. Since property is morally obtained you have the moral right to defend it against theft or damage.\n\n*Ex: Your body is your closest property.*\n\n*Ex: Physical aggression against your body or limiting the substances you can get into your body is immoral.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Money** n. = An abstract mathematical variable, represented by a real world object (Gold, Bitcoin,etc..) that is used to quantify the aggregate subjective values of properties in a given region.\n\n*Ex: Bitcoin is money because it's a voluntarily pre-agreed object used to quantify the values of properties traded with it.*\n\n*Ex: Fiat currency is not money because it's value is centrally controlled by a central bank and the government coerces you to use it, therefore it's not market chosen valuation.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Capital** n. = Property (goods and services) or money that is active in the economy.\n\n*Ex: A warehouse building is capital because it actively facilitates the trade process.*\n\n*Ex: A wooden house in the forest is a property, but it's not a capital, since it's not part of the active trade process.*\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Capitalism** n. = A society based on the, free of coercion, exchange of properties. An economy where capital is, freely of coercion, exchanged therefore creating wealth and prosperity.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Market** n. = A physical or digital place where the exchange of capital or money takes place.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Increasing Wealth** n. = The end result of Capitalism. The increasing quality of life of a person, the more wealth it has the better. Wealth is only produced by Capitalism.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Increasing Poverty** n. = Opposite of increasing wealth. The lack of Capitalism. The quality of life of a person decreasing. Poverty is caused when Capitalism is obstructed or banned by coercion, since people have the natural urge to trade, this can only be blocked by violence.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Socialism** n. = A system of theft where Capital is stolen,obstructed and redistributed in a way by a violent group. It is like a cancer that infests the healthy natural body of the Capitalist system and it's only there to leech off it. It creates poverty as markets will either move underground or be blocked entirely from forming.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Communism** n. = A theoritized system of egalitarian utopia, which is said to be created if Socialism is implemented correctly. The more theft there is the closer it gets to real Communism. In reality every implementation of Communism leads to misery and poverty. Many people die in the atrocities that follow, hence they become equal in their graves. And when they run out of Capital to loot, they will inevitably start to relax it and allow Markets again to form, so that they can have things to steal again like happened in: Cuba, Vietnam, China, Brazil, Russia and many other Communist utopias.\n\nEx: There were 20 million GULAG prisoners in Soviet Union, where the exploitation of slave labor substituted the free market wealth creation process which gave the illusion of wealth creation in the Soviet Union, but at what price.\n\n","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"Accurate Definitions""num_comments":2,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Accurate Definitions"}

Several problems immediately arise (Post 19 for more details).\n\nWe started weeks ago with a new case study on the TERRITORIAL DISPUTES series. We centred the attention on the Israel-Palestine difference. The first ten posts introduced the difference, several views (people at large, academics, politicians, media) and assessed whom may have right to claim sovereignty over the disputed territories. We presented the concept of a colourable claim.\n\nPost 11 reintroduced the EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY and some key elements related to the people in Israel and Palestine (and the diaspora, refugees and settlers) respectively.  From there, we applied the EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY to population and discarded the two state solution.\n\nAfter dealing with population,  we focused on another controversial element: territory. From our previous posts, we have learnt so far that some of the main concerns related to the Israel-Palestine difference are:\nBorders:  This is a constant matter of controversy. For the past few days, demonstrations along Gaza\u2019s border have resulted in many fatal casualties. It is self-evident this is not an isolated fact but an ongoing issue.\u00a0Israeli forces killed at least 60 people and injured more than 1,000 on Monday 14th\u00a0May. The victims were demonstrators who had massed along its roughly 40-mile border with the Gaza Strip. \nDefence:  There seems to be no problem with defence. The territory being defended is obviously desirable although the task is one which can be shared. However, what would happen if another party (for example, a sovereign State with no part in the conflict like Iran or the United States or Russia) decided to invade the disputed territories? In the hypothetical scenario a third party decided to invade the disputed territories, who would defend them?\n\nThe links to the analysis below. Post 20 I introduce myself with a video for the first time. The idea is to build a community of people interested in solving this (and similar) differences by working together. I do not claim to have all the answers. I only aim to offer a platform for an open debate in which we can share information, views and discuss them.\n\nPost 21 will apply the EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY to defence. Thereafter, we centre on law and government. Finally, conclusive remarks by the end of the week.\n\nREMINDER:\nThis is a series I called TERRITORIAL DISPUTES. I introduced basic conceptual elements and thereafter, I apply a theoretical frame (based on Rawlsian methodology) to solve well-known sovereignty disputes or conflicts. I explore what reasonable people would do in a territorial dispute. This is a theoretical experiment that deals with IDEAL theory only. There is no claim to NON IDEAL theory hence issues like lack of compliance are not explored.\n\nIn order to do it, I assume the representatives of each claiming party (sovereign States and a non-sovereign character) choose a rule based on theory game. I go for the maximin. From there, these ideal people come up with a solution to the conflict. \n\nI\u2019ll only post on r/Libertarian on Tuesday a summary of what I do weekly on the blog to avoid spamming this sub-reedit as that is not my intention. I only aim to open a healthy discussion.\n\nCOMMENTS welcomed. GUEST WRITERS would be hugely appreciated. As you may see from the posts I don't take sides and I do this with utmost respect to all people involved. I'd appreciate the same respect in the discussion. I don't claim to have the solution. As I've just mention, I only aim to offer an open floor for discussion.

{"author":"Coldfriction","created_utc":1527018806,"num_comments":35,"score":6,"selftext":"It is apparent that many people are fixed in their ideologies as to the application of governance; meaning that some believe that free market capitalism is always the correct choice whereas socialistic systems are always wrong.  Please consider the following:\n\nCASE 1: Family\n\nWhat is the best form of government for a family?  Children cannot provide for themselves up to a certain age; no way does a \"free market\" and labor based economy work with kids.  I don't think anyone runs their family on libertarian principles.  What form of government exists in your family if you prohibit your kids from using drugs, eating whatever they want, running around naked, etc?\n\nMy observation is that kids that get the most support from their parents for the longest amount of time do better than those who don't and are in turn best situated to provide support for others as well.  Isn't it a form of socialism where a family redistribute wealth that isn't earned by the beneficiary to lift the organization as a whole?  Don't all free market capitalists essentially practice some form of socialism at home?  Isn't the claim to have the right to provide an inheritance to your children just a claim to the right to practice socialism within the family?\n\nMy experience is that the kids that received support all the way through college do the best in life and the earlier the age of separation of support between the parent and the child the worse the child does.  I was raised by people who contributed ZERO to my college education (no food, no clothing, no housing, no tuition, etc.), but as a result I don't have the funds now to buy ownership in the company I work for whereas my coworker twenty feet away who was 100% supported by his family does.  He'll probaby end up being my boss and being payed more than I am in five to ten years time.  I'm behind the curve because I had to do it myself.  Now I'm saving money for my kids education to put them ahead in life.  Does this make me a socialist?\n\nMy great grandfather had kids to work the farm.  Everyone in his generation had as many kids as they could because they worked them without paying them on the farm.  They turned their kids out on their own when they were old enough to leave; many left early.  Requiring kids to provide for themselves is very libertarian.  No free loaders allowed.  Is this the right way of things?\n\n\nCase 2: Business\n\nBusinesses can use any type of government (social structure) really, but most are some form of an oligarchy where the shareholders and/or executives reserve all rights and control and pass on only what is required for an employee to be productive and profitable.  The value added to the social order of a company by the labor of employees is not owned by the worker, but by the shareholder and executives.\n\nI wish nobody would work for a company that didn't provide ownership (stock options at least) as part of the compensation package for the employee.  Everyone should have the option of working for themselves and should obtain more representation in a company the longer time they've spent building the company up.  I also like the idea that ownership should be sold to employees when someone leaves a job.  I believe this is a very libertarian perspective with the individual being in maximum control of their life.  Where employee ownership is not available, I'm not against unions with organized bargaining power due to the organized effort to extract value from employees.  That isn't terribly libertarian at all.\n\nThen there are cooperatives.  These aren't really companies but a group of people using each other to provide support and structure to a common cause of self benefit.\n\nThe cooperatives I'm familiar with are agricultural.  They are basically little pieces of communism where everyone has use of a common (public inside the coop but private to everyone else) property.  These make sense for farmers where they can put their grain into a coop owned silo somewhere and at some time in the future pull that same amount of grain out.  Someone has to make sure that nobody is pilfering the coop though and taking more than they contribute.  It can be very easy to steal from an agricultural coop, so they tend to only let people in they know well and trust.\n\nOther Cases:\n\nVery nearly every social order has some form of government whether or not anyone thinks in those terms.  Sports teams, Home Owner's Associations, Government Agencies (think any Federal US or state agencies practice democracy internally?), Cities, Counties, clubs, churches, etc.  If a group of people have organized, they have some system of government.\n\nI've become aware that I actually believe in very liberal governance at the personal level and socialism at the family level.  Moving up the governmental ladder distancing myself from the authority, I become more libertarian.  In certain social groups I'm very conservative and believe that some groups should be (clubs, churchs, schools, etc).\n\nThe point is that the correct application of government and social order is good.  The incorrect application of it is bad.  If a coop becomes so large that everyone must be a member of the coop to have a chance at surviving or even just thriving, they might as well be subject to a communist government as they are bound the same.  If a business corners the market to become a monopoly, the employees may as well live under a fascist government.  If a father is able to beat his wife and kids and force them to work farm land, those family members may as well be living under a despot dictatorship.  To these people does it matter that the poor implementation of government is local and not general?  \n\nThe point I'm trying to make is, nobody should fall for the ideologue trap and believe that certain systems are always bad or evil.  Everyone is probably a part of a social order that is against what they think they believe.  Only hypocrites go to a church that preaches the authority of God and then go around screaming anti-authoritarianism.  Only hypocrites claim to hate monopolistic tyrants and oligarchies go to work and think their CEO that makes 500x their pay is a great guy.  I've seen so much money worship where people are respected for being rich and solely for that reason it blows my mind.\n\nAlso, every type of social order can be corrupt.  EVERY SINGLE ONE.  The order you think is best has a corrupt version that is ugly.  Free market capitalism without a government that regulates the market to ensure proper competition?  Take that too far and you have aristocrats, monopolies, serfs, and slaves.  Not any better than recent communism failures.  Provide for your kids too much without properly giving them a sense of monetary value (usually earned through working hard)?  They'll throw their inheritance in the garbage and you'll wish you didn't share your wealth with them, because you didn't understand a proper implementation of socialism at the family level.  A libertarian minded person may claim the failure was giving their kids money, when the failure was the implementation of how to give kids money and whether or not they were prepared to receive it.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Apply the right government at the right level."}

Also a $5 maintenance fee on savings accounts.\n\nIf you are job hunting and don't have much money or have dipped into your emergency funds you certainly are [getting charged](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5a68a762e4b0dc592a0e91d6) without realizing it, or will be soon. This was in the ~~fine~~ print when you signed up for your free account, but most people don't tend to remember things that they agreed to as teens when going through crucial life changes like graduation or loss of a job. So I hope posting this again helps people like it did last time.\n\nA customer representative said there's nothing that can be done, so I recommend changing banks perhaps to a credit union if this may be a problem for you.\n\nEdit: TD Bank also does this as per another user.\n\nEdit 2: People are really salty that I've shared this information. If you are not job hunting, in really good financial shape, and already knew this then great, but this post isn't targeted at you. And yes, there *are* banks and credit unions that don't require this kind of fee to provide service. If you personally feel BoA is the best for your particular financial situation, that's totally okay too.\n\nEdit 3: Guys chill, I signed up for the account when I was 16. Yes yes, it's my mistake for not remembering. The point of this post is to help people avoid this mistake and to be aware that there are banks that don't do this. Last year I helped remind some people, and this year I hope to help some more people too. :)\n\nEdit 4: online banking and credit unions have been recommended (which I personally use), and if you absolutely need brick and mortar large chains for some reason USAA and\nCapital One Bank have free accounts.\n\nEdit 5: If you go to close your BoA account, be sure to withdraw or transfer all your money *before* you tell them you want to close your account. They often will try to charge you $10 for the cashier's check to get your money back when you close your account. If you are overseas you're out of luck, there is virtually no way to close your account from overseas and you'll continue to be charged, so remember this before moving abroad or moving back to a country with no BoA.","subreddit":"personalfinance","title":"Warning - Bank of America charges a $144 a year maintenance fee for the basic checking account""num_comments":1,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Warning - Bank of America charges a $144 a year maintenance fee for the basic checking account"}

{"author":"Nifty_Narwhal","created_utc":1527109894,"num_comments":1,"score":6,"selftext":"Hello, r/Libertarian. I am a libertarian who has Type 1 Diabetes, a disease in which the autoimmune system kills and insulin cells produced in the pancreas. Since Type 1 Diabetics are insulin dependent and need to take it everyday in order to control their blood sugar levels to normal range, it should be no surprise that government should not interfere with the market that will make insulin unaffordable for diabetics such as [patents](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/841669#vp_2). However, I did some googling to see if countries actually tax insulin and to my surprise, the ones that tax insulin are the ones that are lower income nations. The taxes themselves are part of the reason why 50\\-75 of the people in countries such as Mongolia, Congo and the Philippines report not being able to obtain insulin. The average tax on imported insulin was 13&amp;#37; with Mongolia having the highest at 30&amp;#37; and the average tax on locally produced insulin was 20.5&amp;#37; with Brazil having the highest at 35&amp;#37;.\n\nThe weirdest part of the tariffs is that although tariffs are used to protect, the report says that tariffs were not effectively used to protect local industries of insulin. Nevertheless, the report states that tariffs should still be removed in order to make insulin available for diabetics in those countries.\n\nI just wanted to post this to see what you guys think. I've been told many times that I must support the government to make sure there is affordable insulin. After all, without the government I will suffer and die under a greedy capitalist system /s.\n\nEdit: Here is the link to the report: [http://www.haiweb.org/medicineprices/02012009/Aug08\\-Policy\\-Paper\\-Access\\-to\\-Diabetes\\-Medicines\\-FINAL.pdf](http://www.haiweb.org/medicineprices/02012009/Aug08-Policy-Paper-Access-to-Diabetes-Medicines-FINAL.pdf)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Tariffs and Taxes on Insulin in Poor Countries"}

This is where I have found the most Libertarian thing I\u2019ve ever seen in a religious text. This was part of a transcript between Chicago PD Media Relations and a Swami in 1975. \n\n\\[With regard to crime in the US vs crime in India\\]\n\nLt. Mozee: Do you have any feelings about crime here in the U.S. as opposed to in your home country of India?\n\nPrabhupada: What is your definition of crime?\n\nLt. Mozee: Any trampling on the rights of one person by another person.\n\nPrabhupada: Yes. Our definition is the same. In the *Upanisads* it is said, \u201cEverything belongs to God.\u201d So, everyone has the right to use whatever is allotted to him by God, but one may not encroach upon other\u2019s property. If one does so, he becomes a criminal.\n\nThe interview then goes solidly into religious discussion, such as the return to religious roots of the country. I just found it interesting that a Swami had a similar view to crime that Libertarianism does. Was also shocked that, at one time, Chicago PD actually thought trampling of rights was a criminal act. \\*ducks for cover from Chicago\\-ans\\*","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"So I was given a book by a traveling monk\u2026"}

Let's crowd-source a program of voluntary government funding of these social goals !!!!!\n\n\nCongress can, and should create a viable, pro-active way of *voluntary* funding to selected programs through the IRS,  that runs parallel to the 'mandatory' funded program process. \n\nHere's how it might work. . . \n\n* Congress considers and passes social engineering legislation as usual, and attaches provisions for funding through the voluntary funding system to the creating bill.\n  \nCongress may fund the first funding cycle normally, as a start-up process, or provide for a funding cycle(s) to occur to provide startup funding before the program is implemented.\n\n* The cost is apportioned to each taxpayer, and is presumed to be approved by them for payment.\n\n* Taxes are calculated normally, then each individual's 'share' of the cost of each voluntary program is added onto the amount due from each taxpayer (or subtracted from refund due each taxpayer).\n\n* The taxpayer can then reduce, increase, or eliminate his/her contribution to each program in the voluntary funding regime.\n\n*  The final total is calculated with these changes, and the final amount due the government - or the taxpayer - is determined.  Payment of taxes, or refunds due are then handled normally.\n\nOTHER FEATURES\n\n* Congress could be empowered to;\n\n   -   Create programs exclusively voluntarily funded, or partially funded under the voluntary regime\n\n   -   Fund these programs normally ( involuntarily)  for a start-up period.\n\n   -   Move programs to and from the voluntary regime , or the normal regime.\n\n   -   Contribute additional funding to voluntarily funded programs in to order to bridge critical funding shortfalls for important programs, or to phase out unpopular ones.\n\n   -   Cancel programs per normal procedure.\n\nI believe such a program would receive wide support because :\n\n   1)   Local , \"vanity\" programs could be funded this way, without valid objection - ( \"it's voluntary ! \"). If the program fails, it's the result of a popular \"vote\".\n\n   2)  The argument for/against each program can involve the actual social benefit the program provides, rather than the it's validity as a use of taxpayer dollars.\n\n   3)   It's the most \"democratic\" method of funding systems.\n\n   4)  It removes popular items from the regular budget in such a way that eliminates populist objections, thereby allowing regular budget balancing to be maximized without the sacrifice of popular programs.\n\n   5)  Gives Congress wide flexibility and power over program funding.\n\n   6)  What argument can there be against voluntary funding ?\n\nLook, this can be a bridge program for multiple political philosophies. Can't we agree that coercion is bad, ?\n. \n \n**What do you say ?

For those that don't know it's essentially a \"Data Protection\" regulation that is supposedly there to punish bad corporations from collecting personally identifying information without consent, that is the core of it basically, and there are a few more provisions and methodologies. It's applied to the entire European Union, and the jurisdiction extends to anywhere on the globe who deal with EU citizens or businesses.\n\n\nNow we have basically people jizzing in their pants: social democrats, socialists, libertarian leftists, privacy advocates, everyone is jizzing in their pants and saying that this is a miracle and how good it is. And now Daddy EU has saved us from Evil Corporations, meanwhile **totally ignoring** [donuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Communications_Headquarters) and [data centers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Data_Center).\n\n\nAm I the only person in the world who totally sees the evil side-effects of this. I view this regulation as a horrible assault on freedom and freedom of speech on the internet, while also having little effect on privacy.\n\nIn fact this regulation is a blatant scam, leftists have promoted it, but I view nothing positive about it at all, all of it will backfire and it will have extremely negative consequences on the free internet.\n\nDon't get me wrong I am a 100% privacy advocate, and yet I am the only one against this regulation, for very simple reasons.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Every single government regulation in the history of mankind is like this:**\n\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/8libp8/how_to_create_misery_101/\n\nThis one is no exception and this one assaults the free internet which is a very evil things in my view.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**Let's review it's characteristics:**\n\n\n* **Universal, applies globally to anyone dealing with EU legal persons:** This means that anyone on the internet, like Joe from USA running a Wordpress blog has to comply with it or risk being fined. The number of massive international fines will definitely create diplomatic incidents that will totally isolate the EU. Either fucking over small companies globally or totally creating a diplomatic crisis for the EU.\n\n* **Vicious penalties:** Penalties can be either 20 million EUR or 4% of global annual turnover, whichever is higher. Yes Joe running his small shop can totally pay that.\n\n* **\"Simplified and strengthened consent from data subjects:\"** This means that every data collection has to have consent in it. These bureau rats are morons and don't know how the internet works. Cookies are already placed on your computer the moment you visit a website, you can't ask the user to consent to something which happens automatically. It would be like turning your lamp on and asking the electricity to wait for your consent before the light shines up, it's physically impossible. These bureau rats of course are technologically morons.\n\n* **\"Mandatory breach notification:\"** Every database breach where personal data is exposed has to be notified to the EU data protection agency within 72 hours. So Joe running his small website has to detect sophisticated state sponsored hackers (probably from China) with his amateur tech skills. As if it's not hard enough for Joe to survive, how now has to learn advanced computer security too, just for running a small shop website.\n\n* **\"A reiteration of important consumer rights:\"** Basically a more detailed and easy to understand Privacy Policy \n\n* **\"Better systems:\"** So companies are forced to have better protection systems, which is good, but again, who is going to pay for it. Small businesses can't pay for it and large businesses already do have protections and still get hacked. So this will only accomplish small businesses getting financially ruined with compliance.\n\n* **\"Specific protection for children:\"** See \"it's for the children\". Well yes it would force companies to handle child data more sensitively, though it should be the parent's duty to teach kids how to use the internet responsibly. You can just delegate responsibility to someone else.\n\n* **\"Data protection officer:\"** Every company now has to hire an IT specialist that will handle the data protection. Aren't there shortages for IT people anyway? How is Joe going to find let alone afford this new employee?\n\n* **\"Data organization and portability:\"** All websites will be forced to organize their data in a controllable and inspectable database (heck even higher risk of getting hacked) while also providing a portable downloadable format of every user's data. Now this horribly takes up the bandwidth of all companies, though I think they are allowed to charge money for it, as most data is in the GB range, it would be very hard to maintain all of that cost free. But again if it's so organized it will just make the potential hacker's job much easier. Even higher risk of hacking.\n\n* **\"Data must be up to date and accurate:\"** So now companies are forcing users to register with their real name and e-mail address possibly asking for phone verification and whatnot, more KYC, effectively destroying online anonymity, how great? And I thought this regulation protects privacy, does it?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo basically all this will do is just destroy small internet businesses. Your local pomp &amp; mom store selling merchandise online, your local fast food, every single small business will be decimated. They will either have to block EU citizens, or if the are in the EU they will have to close down their websites because the risks will not be worth it. \n\nI mean I guarantee you most websites will now simply dissapear and it will centralize the control of the internet into the hands of a few megacorporations, since they won't be affected.\n\nWe know this for a fact because many non-EU websites are already blocking EU IP addresses:\n\n* https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/may/24/sites-block-eu-users-before-gdpr-takes-effect?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\n\nAs for EU websites they will just be forced to shut down due to the risks and costs that are not feasible for small businesses.\n\n\nThere was a wikipedia page (I can't find it) which showed the top websites having the most visitors from 2007 to 2014 and basically shrinking from 30 to 7 I believe. Total centralization.\n\nSo the internet is getting taken over by consolidated megacorporations playing hand in hand with the government, read this article how it all happened:\n\n* https://hackernoon.com/the-evolution-of-the-internet-from-decentralized-to-centralized-3e2fa65898f5\n\n\nIt looks like the EU is now cleaning out the remainder of struggling small websites. I mean it's just very evil. Capitalism is getting destroyed and the EU starts to become like a Soviet Union 2.0.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n--------------------\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAll this will do is just fuel the darknet even more, as many will be forced to go underground to avoid massive regulation. Like even if a person wants to startup a small business now selling some merchandize online, the regulations were already bad, but this will essentially destroy even your last bit of hope.\n\nAll small websites will dissapear in the EU and we will be left with these giants. [Pierre Proudhorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Joseph_Proudhon) wrote back in the 19 century that you can't tax or regulate equality into existence because that will only create a bureaucratic class and inflict more pain into the working class.\n\nProudhorn wrote that all taxes and regulations are essentially stealing from the poor and giving it to the bureaucrat who will in turn share it with his cronies. So why are leftists promoting regulation constantly? I can't understand....\n\nEvery single fucking regulation is like this, no exceptions. Now I guarantee you in the next 10 year, most websites will dissapear or go underground because of this.\n\nThe era of the free internet is over as of today, and the Communist China style net censorship is active in the EU.\n\nIt doesn't protect privacy only slightly, but it inflicts massive burden to small businesses, centralizing the internet even more.\n\n\n**Meanwhile big corporations are not even affected, and are laughing at you:**\n\n* **\"Facebook welcomes regulation: \"** http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/22/technology/regulation-political-ads-facebook-zuckerberg/index.html\n* **\"Facebook meets US lawmakers in secret:\"** http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5594949/Zuckerberg-meets-lawmakers-secret-public-showdown-Congress-week.html\n* **\"Facebook meets EU lawmakers in secret:\"** https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/8kr7us/mark_zuckerberg_to_face_eu_lawmakers_in_private/\n\n\nIt's a fucking scam.","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"GDPR is a scam""num_comments":18,"score":14,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"GDPR is a scam"}

Also apologies for formatting, am on mobile. \n\nWe can\u2019t ignore this forever. We have to talk about how we are going to deal with what looks like inevitable gun control reforms coming to our country.  \n\nI feel the most Libertarian way to go about this (aside from \u201closing\u201d all your guns in a boating accident) is to campaign for \u201cuniversal\u201d gun control wherein the police and all other government agencies must also comply with any gun control measures enacted on the general public with no exceptions. I feel this accomplishes a few goals while keeping the spirit of Libertarianism alive even through legislation. \n\n1. It keeps the playing field level. The whole point of the 2A is so that we as the citizenry are able to fight back against Government tyranny should shit go down. If they can\u2019t have better guns than us then that\u2019s a start.  \n\n2. Reduces militarization of police. This is a big one for a lot of us. The police don\u2019t need fucking tanks and limiting the kind of firepower they have is on our laundry list anyway. \n\n3. It plays the game. We can\u2019t keep our fingers in our ears screaming \u201cLALALA, CAN\u2019T HEAR YOU OVER ALL THIS FREEDOM\u201d on every issue we don\u2019t like. We\u2019ve got to make a compromise here and there to get mainstream politics to take us seriously. I get that we don\u2019t want any gun control, but would we rather the government enact legislation restricting private ownership while placing no restrictions on themselves versus at least trying to keep the government beholden to the same laws as the rest of us?\n\n4. It forces a real debate. I know we like reals over feels here and challenging why the police need 15+ round magazines when you or I don\u2019t is a very real issue on gun control that I don\u2019t see brought up nearly as often. Too many gun control advocates want government excluded from the conversation and I say we force that conversation. \n\n5. It gets people who maybe don\u2019t like us to support our position on something. I realize that commies and Antifa maybe aren\u2019t the most welcome folks at an LP gathering, but they also want more police accountability and less militarization, so while we maybe don\u2019t agree 100% with them, we can at least get more of the angry millennial/gen Z voters to see Libertarians as more than just gun toting rednecks. \n\n\n\n\nIn short, as much as any of us don\u2019t like the idea of gun control or support for legislation, I think the smart thing to do is to get a plan in place that keeps the playing field as level as possible while limiting government power in the process.

We found out through whistle-blowers that the NSA has been violating our constitution rights and our privacy.\n\n\nI think that the best way to combat this would be to have an elected council of 9 or so individuals who would be able to review cases brought by whistle-blowers within the US government and vote on whether or not to disclose the information to the public by declassifying the documents brought to them. This would, of course, have to include immunity for the whistle-blower regardless of the outcome. This way, there is indirect public oversight of the unseen side of the government. It would be able to keep things classified when they are genuinely in the public interest, and expose it when its not.\n\nThis wouldn't be perfect, but there currently aren't any checks or balances on the classified side of our government. It would ideally act similar to a court where government proponents of a classified program or document would argue the case for national security while the whistle-blower and/or their appointed legal council would argue for declassification. Ironically, the court proceedings would certainly need to be classified themselves.\n\nThoughts?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Government Oversight"}

I have been defending the players protest as it is their right as individuals to express themselves and there were no rules, restrictions or bylaws in the NFL to say otherwise.  Now, like most Americans, I am a part of a family who has family members deeply affected by war.  My grandfather is a Korean War vet, a USMC, Purple Heart recipient and without a doubt my lifelong hero.  His nephew was also killed in action in the Vietnam War.  So needless to say, some family members do not share my views on the free speech rights.  \n\nOne thing that has come to my mind is the phrase \u201cthis person fought for your right to freedom, so you have to respect the flag/anthem\u201d.  To that thought I\u2019ve began to wonder, who did fight for our rights, our freedoms?  What war that has been fought since World War II has threatened the American way of life?  Korea?  Vietnam?  Most historians will tell you those wars were senseless and unnecessary.  So were they fighting for our freedom?  Or were they simply sent off to kill and/or die at the hands of misguided politicians?  Was Desert Storm a threat to our society?  I\u2019m sure a lot of people will say The War on Terror threatened us but that wasn\u2019t an attack by a specific country or nation and that war has been a failure and again, likely unnecessary.  So who has the right to tell you to stand for the flag or the anthem?  What does respecting the flag and anthem really mean?  \n\nOne other thing that bothers me with this whole anthem debate is Trump.  It\u2019s widely known that Trump\u2019s family used their status to keep him from going into the service and being sent to Vietnam.  During his presidential campaign he took shots at John McCain, saying he doesn\u2019t like people who get captured.  McCain, Vietnam vet, was captured and tortured in the Hanoi Hilton before his eventual release.  So the President, a draft dodger who makes light of a POWs capture is somehow qualified to lead the charge against people protesting the National Anthem?  How much sense does that make?\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"What is offensive?"}

But given that we are going to have taxation I lean on flat tax rate on income as compared to a consumption tax. To begin with a lot of consumption taxes are highly selective on what is and is not taxed (most food is tax free, some health products but not all, ect...). I am strongly opposed to anyone getting to make a decision of what is and is not taxable so in that sense I default to income. \n\n\nProblem with this is of course that \u201cincome\u201d is not easily defined at times. Capital gains for example, tips for employees, non-monetary payment, ect.... but I still feel this is a more clean approach in general. \n\n\nI also think the advantage of the flat tax rate is that it doesn\u2019t punish success as much as a graduated rate does. If your a high school kid working at a gas station or bill gates, twenty cents of every dollar you make goes to the government (say). \n\n\nPart of this also is that coorpertations are not taxed. Only individuals can (should anyway) be taxed. Businesses in my mind are noting more than a collection of property often owned in joint by a group of people so taxing a business then taxing the income of the people who own the business is a double taxation and is inherently wrong; morally and economically.  \n\n\n\nThoughts??\n\n\n\nEdit: I cannot English worth a damn and I\u2019m drunk so...please forgive spelling and grammar mistakes","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"What is your stance on the income tax?"}

{"author":"PrideAndPolitics","created_utc":1527371424,"num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"Society is somewhat organised with lots of people. People barter and trade and have tons of weapons and fortifications to prevent them from stealing stuff. \n\n\n\n\nHowever, this society shares borders with other, more oppressive societies wishing to expand. So the primitive society organises a militia and a government, to help protect them, organise prisons, and so on. \n\n\n\n\nThis primitive society sometimes trades with other societies, so the primitive society government raises revenue to fund its militia by imposing a small tariff on goods traded and an entry fee for guests, but the primitive society still largely remains laissez-faire. \n\n\n\n\nThe people themselves find it difficult to just barter for what they need, so one of the society members decides, with no input from the government, to use coconuts as a medium for exchange. Coconuts have tons of value, so they work out well. \n\n\n\nPeople use coconuts to trade everything, even the government. The government begins to collect the import/export tariffs in the form of coconuts and is better equipped to fund the militia. Many wars are won with this militia and the people inside this primitive society are happy and free. The government's sole purpose is to provide a militia and to defend the society, and does not overreach this power. \n\n\n\nHowever, some of the members of the society are poor. Much of the society is organised by large corporations, who often band together to raise the prices in coconuts for their goods and services. \n\n\n\nMany people starve. \n\n\n\nThe government, which is elected by the people, decides to break up some companies to make the market more competitive. This isn't a huge issue, because the market is still very laissez-faire. So the companies are broken up and prevented from banding together. The government uses the militia to enforce this. \n\n\n\n\nThe government's duties now begin to expand rapidly, as many candidates promise generosity for the poor, starving people. The starving people vote for generous gifts from the public militia fund. \n\n\n\nNow the government's duties expand so large with great magnitude, that the funding from imports/exports becomes insufficient to fund the generous gifts offered to the poor, for they can't just fund the militia and the poor at the same time. \n\n\n\n\nSo the government begins to start up some services. Things like mines, trails, and other means of production are started by the government to compete with the private businesses. The private businesses now start to donate some coconuts to make the government bigger to make it easier for consumers to offer the businesses more coconuts. \n\n\n\n\nI think that you see where this is going.... \n\n\n\n\nSo now the government's duties become **too** big. So big, in fact, that the government imposes a policy in which every single member of the primitive society must offer 1/5th of their coconuts and anyone who refuses to offer up their coconuts will be killed by the militia. \n\n\n\n\nSo many people are so fed up with this that they willingly refuse to pay up their coconuts. \n\n\n\n\"You're so selfish!!!!\", the poor people complained to the rebels, as they received more and more gifts from the public treasury.\n\n\n\n\nThe militia begins to execute some of the people who refuse to pay. \n\n\n\n\nHowever, this is ineffective because some people would rather die than pay up their coconuts. \n\n\n\nSo now the government has to get creative. The government decides that instead of just killing those who refuse to have their coconuts forcibly taken, **they would just put them in chains and sell them into slavery to get more coconut funding**. This raises the government *tons* of revenue and some businesses even offer to build private prisons to get a share of the coconut government slave fund. \n\n\n\n\nThe coconut supply begins to run short because of the ever-increasing theft. \n\n\n\n\nIn order to mitigate this, the government decides to take everyone's coconuts away and put them into a central bank. Everyone whose coconuts were taken were offered valuable slips of leaves, which mean nothing other than they can be exchanged at the central bank for coconuts at any time. \n\n\n\n\nThis begins to go well, because the government decides the exchange rate for leaves/coconuts and this raises them even more coconut revenue. They have so much revenue that the government feeds themselves off of the coconuts taken from the people. \n\n\n\nAnyone who is contrary to this government belief is executed or sold into slavery. \n\n\n\n\nThe central bank, which uses worthless leaves as its medium for exchange, begins to give these worthless leaves to other banks in the primitive society. **This allows the government to control the prices and to control the tax rates**, which gets them even more coconuts. \n\n\n\nIn fact, there are so many leaves and not enough coconuts, that the exchange rate falls so low that the people run on the central bank and withdraw their coconuts en masse. People turn to other mediums of exchange, like gold and other precious metals.\n\n\n\n\nThis presents a problem to the government because it threatens their taxing power and their selfishness, so they concoct another plan. \n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, they forcibly take away everyone's coconuts. \n\n\n\n\nBut instead of offering back the coconuts at an exchange rate for leaves, the government decides to **not redeem the worthless slips of leaves for coconuts**, instead, they will control the output of worthless leaves and force everyone to ONLY use those worthless leaves as their medium for exchange. Anyone found using other currencies is captured by the militia and sold into slavery. \n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the government enjoys all of the coconuts left in their control, and they eat a happy last meal. They guarantee new slips of paper to large businesses for free in exchange for the business' vote and ceding of power, and even use their militia to help the businesses stay in power over the worthless slips of leaves. \n\n\n\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a brief history of the United States Dollar brought to you by McNuke^^tm and others.

{"author":"PurpleJew_","created_utc":1527448822,"num_comments":71,"score":121,"selftext":"Immigration is good for the US. [This survey](http://www.nber.org/papers/w16736.pdf) is a meta-analysis of the entire literature on the economic effects of immigration. Their findings indicate that the consensus among economists is that the total effect of immigrants on public finance is net positive. In fact, if we legalized current illegal immigrants they would pay [more in payroll taxes](https://americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/adding-billions-tax-dollars-paid-undocumented-immigrants). This is specifically key to maintaining the solvency of our [failing social security system](http://www.crfb.org/papers/analysis-2016-social-security-trustees-report) by increasing the inflow of funds to the social security trust fund. Second of all, [they commit crime at lower rates than citizens do](http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/cacounts/CC_208KBCC.pdf). Third, most studies indicate that illegal immigrants [have little to no impact on wages](https://www.cato.org/blog/immigrations-real-impact-wages-employment). Immigrants don't just supply jobs, they also demand jobs. They consume goods and services just like any citizen would do, thus the net effect on wages would be neutral. Finally, immigrants and natives do not directly compete for the same work. In other words, they are imperfect substitutes, as they have different skills, not least in language, and seek different jobs - generally, immigrants seek jobs that natives don't want to do or where there is a skills shortage. This is evidenced by [Ottiovani and Peri](http://www.nber.org/papers/w14188) who show in the long run, even low skilled immigrants have a positive effect on low skilled natives\u2019 incomes.\n\nTerrorism caused by immigrants is overblown. First of all, the impact of terrorism is dramatically overblown. Between the years 1970 and 2007, [Mueller and Stewart](https://politicalscience.osu.edu/faculty/jmueller/FAexistentialfin.pdf) indicate that only 3,292 American civilians died from terrorist attacks. That's about 89 civilians per year. Compare that to the [1,146 civilians who were killed by police officers in 2015](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database). That's right, you are more likely to be killed by a police officer than a terrorist. Moreover, [Alex Nowrasteh](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa798_2.pdf) indicates that the chance of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion per year while the chance of being murdered in an attack committed by an illegal immigrant is an astronomical 1 in 10.9 billion per year.\n\n[New housing construction is well below the historical average](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=gkOz). Decreases in the expected level of immigration are having an impact on the construction market because the [construction workforce relies heavily on immigrant labor](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2017/04/how_can_there_b.html).\n\nThe wall won't work. [Around 50% of all undocumented immigrants come here legally and out stay their visas](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/FY%2015%20DHS%20Entry%20and%20Exit%20Overstay%20Report.pdf). What will the wall do about that? Also, the rate of growth of undocumented immigrants coming from Mexico has dramatically declined over recent years. [From the period between 2003 and 2007 to the period of 2008 to 2012, immigration from Mexico decreased 57%](http://www.businessinsider.com/r-immigration-to-us-from-mexico-drops-sharply-study-2015-7). Additionally, [illegal immigration from Asia is growing at a much faster rate than illegal immigration from Mexico](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/08/asians-now-outpace-mexicans-in-terms-of-undocumented-growth/432603/). Furthermore, [the total number of undocumented immigrants in the United States has been declining in recent years](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/27/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/). Finally, more Mexican immigrants are actually [leaving the US](http://www.pewhispanic.org/2015/11/19/more-mexicans-leaving-than-coming-to-the-u-s/) than the total number of Mexicans immigrating to the US (both legal and illegal). All of these facts mitigate the efficacy of the wall.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Immigration is good for the US"}

{"author":"Dr_Jorge","created_utc":1527592584,"num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"The longstanding and still unresolved territorial dispute  between Israel and Palestine has several dimensions. The current nomenclature in legal and political sciences used the term territorial dispute. Yet, the Israel-Palestine difference is a clear example of an ongoing dispute that has to do with territory as well as population, government and law domestically, regionally and internationally.\n\nThis blog series \"Territorial disputes\" originally aimed only to briefly introduce conceptual elements (first ten posts of the series) and thereafter present a succinct overview of relevant and current examples. Before we covered the Israel-Palestine difference, we had addressed Kashmir, the Malvinas/Falkland islands, and Gibraltar. The plan was to write and publish only ten posts (like with the rest of the case studies) for the Israel-Palestine difference. Thanks to the comments made by one of our readers, I decided to extend the assessment of this particular case study.\n\nBecause of the nature of this series and its platform (a blog), I have covered the basis in relation to the Israel-Palestine difference and the application of the egalitarian shared sovereignty to evaluate a solution. However, there are questions that are more complex and more serious problems to address. I am addressing these questions with future dedicated research. To give an answer to these points deserve a more in depth analysis that will have to include technicalities in terms of statistical information, methodology and content based on the disciplines of reference. In addition to this, I do my best to keep this blog series as accessible as possible for anybody (at least, most people) to be able to get a grasp and participate in the discussion.\n\nHaving said that, the last 24 posts (link to the blog below) have enabled us to:\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Be familiar with a brief historical chronology.\n\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Distinguish historical facts from religious account.\n\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Understand some key domestic, regional and international reasons behind this difference.\n\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Introduce the concept of \u201ccolourable claim\u201d and explore three different grounds: historical entitlement, legal basis and moral standing. Its main outcome is that both Israelis and Palestinians ought to be part of any negotiation concerning the sovereignty (de jure\u00a0and\u00a0de facto) over the disputes territories.\n\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Introduce the solutions presented in resent years by the United States, United Nations and Arab League.\n\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Learn that all the aforementioned solutions suggest explicitly or implicitly partition.\n\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Assess why partition is not a recommendable and fair solution.\n\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Evaluate by means of an abstract experiment how the egalitarian shared sovereignty may solve the difference and could materialise in terms of population, territory, government and law.\n\n\nWith all this in mind, three main partial conclusions leave the door open for future reflection and analysis:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sovereignty of the disputed territories should not be totally in the hands of only one of the claiming parties either Israel or Palestine.\n\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If existing conditions in terms of sovereignty continue, they will only perpetuate a status quo and therefore, a legal and political limbo securing only one result: a volatile area in many ways.\n\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0United Nations or any other party alien to the dispute (for example, United States, United Kingdom, Russia, Arab League) should not interfere.\n\n\nThere is nothing completely unresolvable if we look together for a solution. Indeed, if we choose not to solve the difference and we do not look for ways to move forward we are not going to find it. It is usually the case in this kind of differences that victory for one party means the other party has to suffer. When we shift the focus and understand we are all human beings and we are all fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters doing our best to let our future generations live in a better world we may have a chance. It is not only up to Israelis to find a solution. It is not only up to Palestinians to do it either. It is up to all of us.\n\nPost 66 (Monday 28th May) introduces another territorial dispute.\n\nBlog (link):\nhttps://london1701.blogspot.co.uk\n\nRegards.

I argued that I\u2019d rather just let racists be open about their beliefs and see how long their businesses lasts in the free market. His position was that the government should force businesses to cater to all people, even though in my opinion that means unknowingly giving profits to someone that doesn\u2019t see someone as their equal. He also argued that the regulation does not really cause any problems and prevents racism. My response was that there is in fact problems with that sort of regulation, such as many frivolous lawsuits that businesses are now prone too because anyone can claim they were being discriminated against for being fired or not being hired.  My side of this debate boiled down to the fact that it would be much more beneficial to allow people to run THEIR OWN private business according to their beliefs, regardless of what they are because \n1) free speech is an inalienable right in the United States that applies to employers \n2) the Supreme Court has ruled multiple times that freedom of speech can be denied to you while working under a private employer (I.e. whoever is in charge can decide what people the business can cater to) \n3) no one inherently has a right to someone else\u2019s goods or services.\n\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts/opinions on anti-discrimination laws with regards to private businesses.

However, I think it is time that we stop this needless divide and find some common ground. The media is purposefully dividing our nation and pitting is against eachother, when the real enemy is the GOVERNMENT. Yes, I realize that communists like myself have vastly different views on how the government should work than libertarians do, but we realize that the system is corrupt and the establishment must be stopped. \n\nThis is going to be an uncomfortable subject, but the elephant in the room needs to be addressed. There are far too many Europeans in this country that are pushing an identitarian agenda. I realize that some of them may have good intentions, but I would say that the identitarian movement is generally more divisive than anything and takes the focus away from the catalyst that is responsible for all the issues that plague this nation today, which is the establishment. It isn\u2019t white people with European ancestry, but it is actual fucking Europeans with an allegiance to Europe that is the problem. People like George Soros and the Koch brothers come to mind. They have businesses in Europe, and have lobbied for European interests. Europeans are deliberately doing whatever they can to  maintain the current political establishment, and it is time we join forces and fight the establishment. We need to form an actual anti establishment party to have a chance of winning. Find some issues that all or most sides of the anti establishment spectrum agree on, such as ending the drug war, anti war sentiment, more regulations on things like gerrymandering, etc. \n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Europeanism is ideologically opposed to both libertarianism and communism"}

If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.\u200a\u2014\u200aIn this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.\n\nSo here from the statement:\n\n\\&gt;\u200aIn this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise.\n\nWe can see that he does not promote hate speech laws as he believes that it can be countered by better speech. On the other hand, he says that if a speaker denounces all other arguments or forbids listeners from hearing other arguments or tells them to react to other arguments with violence, then suppression may be necessary.\n\nSo what are your thoughts?

The mods have been removing them and banning those users. \n\nR/socialism (and socialists all together) takes a clear stance of not only an ideological difference, but of historical fact on Nazism: \n\n**The** **Nazis** **were** **not** **socialists.**\n\nThe proof is not only one of simple ideological differences, but also of historical/academic backing: \n\n&gt; The National Socialists completely ignored socialism\u2019s primary aim (replacing the existing class-based society with an egalitarian one in which workers owned the means of production) and substituted their own topsy-turvy agenda, Evans writes, \u201creplacing class with race, and the dictatorship of the proletariat with the dictatorship of the leader\u201d: \"The \u201cNational Socialists\u201d wanted to unite the two political camps of left and right into which, they argued, the Jews had manipulated the German nation. The basis for this was to be the idea of race. This was light years removed from the class-based ideology of socialism. Nazism was in some ways an extreme counter-ideology to socialism, borrowing much of its rhetoric in the process, from its self-image as a movement rather than a party, to its much-vaunted contempt for bourgeois convention and conservative timidity.\"\n\n&gt; German historian and National Socialism expert Joachim Fest characterizes this repurposing of socialist rhetoric as an act of \u201cprestidigitation\u201d: \"This ideology took a leftist label chiefly for tactical reasons. It demanded, within the party and within the state, a powerful system of rule that would exercise unchallenged leadership over the \u201cgreat mass of the anonymous.\u201d And whatever premises the party may have started with, by 1930 Hitler\u2019s party was \u201csocialist\u201d only to take advantage of the emotional value of the word, and a \u201cworkers\u2019 party\u201d in order to lure the most energetic social force. As with Hitler\u2019s protestations of belief in tradition, in conservative values, or in Christianity, the socialist slogans were merely movable ideological props to serve as camouflage and confuse the enemy.\"\n\n&gt; The proof was in the pudding. Not long after acquiring the reins of power, the Nazis banned the Social Democratic Party and sent its leaders and other leftists identified as threats to the National Socialist program to concentration camps. According to the Holocaust Encyclopedia: \"In the months after Hitler took power, SA and Gestapo agents went from door to door looking for Hitler\u2019s enemies. They arrested Socialists, Communists, trade union leaders, and others who had spoken out against the Nazi party; some were murdered. By the summer of 1933, the Nazi party was the only legal political party in Germany. Nearly all organized opposition to the regime had been eliminated. Democracy was dead in Germany.\"\n\n&gt; Above all, the Nazis were German white nationalists. What they stood for was the ascendancy of the \u201cAryan\u201d race and the German nation, by any means necessary. Despite co-opting the name, some of the rhetoric, and even some of the precepts of socialism, Hitler and party did so with utter cynicism, and with vastly different goals. **The** **claim** **that** **the** **Nazis** **actually** **were** **leftists** **or** **socialists** **in** **any** **generally** **accepted** **sense** **of** **those** **terms** **flies** **in** **the** **face** **of** **historical** **reality.**\n\nhttps://www.snopes.com/news/2017/09/05/were-nazis-socialists/\n\nThis is a non-debatable fact that is not only met with disgust in all socialist communities, but also considered fraudulent in most academic and historical circles. The Nazis were outright nationalists that imprisoned and killed many of our comrades before and during WWII. Nazis are consistently fighting the left in modern times. \n\nBecause of this, any comments/posts that attempt to disprove or debate this historical fact will be removed, and those users will be met with an immediate ban. If there is good-faith curiosity regarding the subject (and these sources do not convince you), please take those questions to r/socialism_101. These types of questions will be treated in the same regard, since this subreddit is a space for socialists. \n\n**Edit:** [It seems like the lies continues...](https://np.reddit.com/r/ShitPoliticsSays/comments/8ng7w8/rsocialism_claims_nazis_were_not_socialists/)\n\n**Edit 2:** Shout out to u/Prince_of_Loch_Ness for this counter regarding Nazi economic polices:\n\n&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/27771569?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\n\n&gt; Against the mainstream: Nazi privatization in 1930s Germany\n\n&gt; \"The Great Depression spurred State ownership in Western capitalist countries. Germany was no exception; the last governments of the Weimar Republic took over firms in diverse sectors.\n\n&gt; Later, the Nazi regime transferred public ownership and public services to the private sector. In doing so, they went against the mainstream trends in the Western capitalist countries, none of which systematically reprivatized firms during the 1930s. Privatization in Nazi Germany was also unique in transferring to private hands the delivery of public services previously provided by government. \"","subreddit":"socialism","title":"Users Will Be Banned For Claiming Nazis Were/Are Socialists.""num_comments":28,"score":7,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Users Will Be Banned For Claiming Nazis Were/Are Socialists."}
