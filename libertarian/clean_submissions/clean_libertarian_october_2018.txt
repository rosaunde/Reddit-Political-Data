It was cool and all but at some point the tone of the party changed and everyone started mentioning esoteric terms I'd never heard before like, \"the labour theory of value\" and \"labour vouchers\" and \"seizing the means of production. I was like \"Uhh, okay\". Then they let a flag unfurl. It had a red star made of blood, the blood of banksters one of them said. When they asked me what I believed in I said, \"You know? I think mixed-economies are alright. You can take concepts from ideologies and create something nuanced instead of submitting to dogma\". Well, they looked at me like I had just enticed a peasant into working for me for a wage. They drew out knives and one of them had a fucking sickle and hammer (while horrified I admired the dedication). I ran. I had to find a way out of the house but I got lost. Alone and afraid I bumped into a bespectacled grandpa looking fellow who had a strange golden aura around him. He said that I could be free but I had to stop fearing freedom and that only then could I escape the house. I turned to look down a corridor but when I looked back the man was gone. After a about 10 minutes of running down the corridor a sickle burst through one of the walls, which crumbled as the marauding socialist smashed his hammer against it. I offered him universal healthcare, higher taxes, even the minimum wage, begged and pleaded but he said it wasn't enough. He wanted my means of production. I thought he said reproduction and was afraid he would claim my balls. The grandpa man appeared again but the socialist could not see him (or didn't want to see him). He whispered to me, \"Believe in capitalism. Notice his weapons, they look hand made, not made by a firm with a profit incentive to produce quality sickles and hammers \" and with that, like Neo realizing he's the one, I realized the truth. As the socialist brought back the sickle the blade fell off and the hammer exploded with the force of a thousand suns blowing me through the wall behind me and into the sunlight. Again, the man was gone. So I silently thanked him and ran. That man saved my life and that man's name? Milton Friedman.","subreddit":"neoliberal","title":"One time...""num_comments":2,"score":5,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"One time..."}

What people have heard of however, is how Urban Dictionary defines the term; [as a threesome](https:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=Devils%20Triangle).\n\n&gt;A Twitter user, who maintains data on all reddit comments, had shown that out of 4 billion comments since 2008, there is not one single reference to a drinking game, but there are several to a threesome.\n\n&gt;https:\/\/twitter.com\/jasonbaumgartne\/status\/1045512413511069697\n\n#Drinking habits\n\n* \"I'm known to have a weak stomach.\"\n\n&gt;Nate Silver believes that he is lying about his drinking habits, writing:\n\n&gt;This is a liveblog, so I\u2019m just going to tell you what I\u2019m thinking: I think it seems pretty damned obvious that Kavanaugh is lying about questions surrounding his drinking habits. I think he\u2019s concluded that he has to lie about them because if it can be established that he drinks to the point of blacking out or at least \u201cgetting fuzzy,\u201d then his denial isn\u2019t worth very much when Ford said the incident occurred when Kavanaugh was very drunk. He might undertake the strategy of lying about his drinking habits whether he was guilty of the assault, innocent of the assault, or was too drunk to know either way. But if you\u2019ve been following the details about this case, it\u2019s very, very likely that he\u2019s knowingly lying about his drinking habits.\n\n#Blacking out\n\n* \"But I did not drink beer to the point of blacking out\u2026Passed out would be \u2014 no, but I've gone to sleep, but \u2014 but I've never blacked out.\"\n\n&gt;Nate Silver also writes about Kavanaugh's contradictory statements about his memory losses.\n\n&gt;The fact is that Kavanaugh has made repeated [public statements that refer to memory losses](https:\/\/medium.com\/@7im\/what-happens-on-the-bus-stays-on-the-bus-8fd0f13eca97) that would seem to be related to drinking \u2014 about not remembering the scores of sporting events in his yearbook, about the bus trip to the Red Sox game, and (in an email that was disclosed to the Judiciary Committee from his time in the Bush White House) about not remembering the details of a night during a boat trip he made in 2001. Given that most heavy drinkers black out at least occasionally and that he\u2019s made all these references to memory losses, it\u2019s simply very unlikely that he\u2019s never blacked out.\n\n#Not refuted\n\n* \"Dr. Ford's allegation is not merely uncorroborated, it is refuted by the very people she says were there, including by a longtime friend of hers.\"\n \n# 2003 Perjury about stolen democratic emails\n\n* \"No. Again, I was not aware of that matter in any way whatsoever until I learned it in the media.\"\n\n# 2005 Perjury about stolen democratic emails\n\n* \"I'm not aware of the memos, I never saw such memos that I think you're referring to.

When you passed the bar in Maryland, you would have been asked if there are any legal considerations the bar needs to know about to consider your application.

In one message, Yarasavage said Kavanaugh asked her to go on the record in his defense. Two other messages show communication between Kavanaugh's team and former classmates in advance of the story.\n\n&gt;In now-public transcripts from an interview with Republican Judiciary Committee staff on September 25, two days after the Ramirez allegations were reported in the New Yorker, Kavanaugh claimed that it was Ramirez who was \u201ccalling around to classmates trying to see if they remembered it,\u201d adding that it \u201cstrikes me as, you know, what is going on here? When someone is calling around to try to refresh other people? Is that what\u2019s going on? What\u2019s going on with that? That doesn\u2019t sound \u2014 that doesn\u2019t sound \u2014 good to me. It doesn\u2019t sound fair. It doesn\u2019t sound proper. It sounds like an orchestrated hit to take me out.\u201d\n\n...\n\n&gt;Berchem's texts with Yarasavage shed light on Kavanaugh\u2019s personal contact with friends, including that he obtained a copy of a photograph of a small group of friends from Yale at a 1997 wedding in order to show himself smiling alongside Ramirez 10 years after they graduated. Both were in the wedding party: Kavanaugh was a groomsman and Ramirez a bridesmaid at the wedding.\n\n&gt;On Sept, 22nd, Yarasavage texted Berchem that she had shared the photo with \u201cBrett\u2019s team.\u201d\n\n&gt;But when Kavanaugh was asked about the wedding during a committee interview on Sept. 25th, he said he was \u201cprobably\u201d at a wedding with Ramirez. Asked if he interacted with her at the wedding, Kavanaugh replied, \u201cI am sure I saw her because it wasn\u2019t a huge wedding,\u201d but added that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a specific recollection.\u201d Lying to Congress is a felony whether testimony is taken under oath or not.\n\n\n---\n\nThanks to \/u\/RELEASE_PEE-PEE_TAPE:\n\n#Running list of Kavanaugh Fact Checks:\n\n* *Washington Post* - [Here\u2019s where Kavanaugh\u2019s sworn testimony was misleading or wrong](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/2018\/09\/28\/heres-where-kavanaughs-sworn-testimony-was-misleading-or-wrong\/)\n\n* *Slate* - [Kavanaugh Lied to the Judiciary Committee\u2014Repeatedly](https:\/\/slate.com\/news-and-politics\/2018\/09\/kavanaugh-lied-senate-judiciary-committee.html)\n\n* *New York Times* - [At Times, Kavanaugh\u2019s Defense Misleads or Veers Off Point](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/09\/28\/us\/politics\/brett-kavanaugh-fact-check.html)\n\n* *Current Affairs* - [How we know Kavanaugh is lying](https:\/\/www.currentaffairs.org\/2018\/09\/how-we-know-kavanaugh-is-lying)","subreddit":"Keep_Track","title":"All of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Lies | 13 Under Oath""num_comments":2,"score":3,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"All of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Lies | 13 Under Oath"}

Letting them fight it out between them? I think that might work. It would settle to the appropriate price after a few rounds.\n\n**Edit**: Found the answer. https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jeffmcmahon\/2014\/10\/12\/what-would-milton-friedman-do-about-climate-change-tax-carbon\/\n\n&gt;Cicala outlined two possibilities for creating a carbon market. The first is to cap carbon emissions at a certain level and then allow the market to determine the cost of carbon by trading carbon offsets. That solution\u2014\u201dcap and trade\u201d\u2014is uncontroversial among economists, he said, but it failed in Congress in 2011.\n\n&gt;The second would be to estimate the price of carbon and tax it.\n\n&gt;Estimating the cost is tricky, Greenstone said, but scientists and economists have models for projecting the cost of each added ton of carbon on agricultural losses, mortality, sea-level rise, storm surge, and other climate effects.\n\n&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated task but I think the best evidence suggests that it\u2019s probably around $40 a ton,\u201d he said. The U.S. government has projected the cost of carbon emissions at $37 per ton.\n\n&gt;One audience member challenged the economists at this point, saying Friedman would not be so cavalier about a tax when there is uncertainty about its optimum level and likely effects.\n\n&gt;\u201cThere is uncertainty,\u201d Cicala replied. \u201cThere is no question. Name me another policy where there was no uncertainty.\u201d\n\n&gt;The uncertainty, Cicala said, \u201cshould have us terrified\u201d\u2014not terrified of the effects of a price on carbon, but terrified of the effects of increased carbon concentrations in the atmosphere and ocean.\n\n&gt;The\u00a0forum\u00a0was sponsored by the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics, Green Ecnomonics Group, and the Energy Policy Institute of Chicago. The moderator, Inglis, is now executive director of\u00a0the conservative \u00a0Energy &amp; Enterprise Initiative.\n\n&gt;According to Greenstone, who came to the University of Chicago last year from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, economists agree broadly on the benefits of a carbon price.\n\n&gt;\u201cThe media always reports that there\u2019s near consensus among scientists about the effect of human activity on the climate. What gets less attention is that I think there\u2019s even greater consensus, starting from Milton Friedman and going to the most left-wing economist you can find, that the obvious practical solution is to put a price on carbon. It\u2019s not controversial.\u201d\n\nhttps:\/\/www.edf.org\/climate\/how-cap-and-trade-works\n\n&gt;As companies use established techniques to lower emissions, such as adopting energy-efficient technology, entrepreneurs see opportunity. Ever wonder why you don't hear about acid rain anymore?

In theory it explains how we were able to reduce lending interest to near 0% and yet not see high inflation. \n\nThe theory behind it is something they call labor capacity. How much your nation can work essentially. If you don't go over that capacity, your inflation will remain low. So if you have a nail factory working at 50% capacity, then government spending to increase that demand to 70% of capacity, you aren't going to cause much inflation because the company isn't needing to hire anyone new. No need to buy up new factories, etc. \n\nTax and spending are ways to control inflation, taxes reduce it and spending increases it. For example, if the rich were to suddenly start spending, inflation would go up, so a government should then increase taxes or lower spending to reduce the inflation in the country. \n\nThere is a lot more, but this was on NPR and is part of an Economic School's new theory on monetary policy. In theory it explains our great recession and the great depression, why they last as long as they do, and how interest rates affect money policy.

That saying: \"*Birds of a feather flock together*\" springs to mind.

{"author":"Elesheva","created_utc":1538630677,"num_comments":29,"score":6,"selftext":"I have a few things in common with [Christine Blasey Ford](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Christine_Blasey_Ford). I came of age during the wild and wooly 80s. I studied psychology as an undergraduate. I was unwillingly groped by horny teenage boys back in high school, and I have gone \u201ctoe-to-toe\u201d with the powerful establishment and desperate men intent on protecting their reputations amidst sexual harassment allegations. However, unlike Dr. Ford, I actually know what it is like to be raped.\n\nIn fact, I have a unique perspective on sexual assault. Not only do I have first-hand knowledge of what a victim goes through during and after an attack, I also understand how devastating accusations can be to the accused. I have witnessed at least one life ruined by uncorroborated claims. I have watched the falsely accused, a close friend, lose everything in order to prove his innocence. I can testify to the extent which his family suffered and detail the ramifications those allegations had on his career. Sadly, and most upsetting, I can tell you that despite his proven innocence, our increasingly un-empathetic society, still demands he bear the scar of his own ugly \u201cscarlet letter.\u201d There is no doubt in my mind that his pain is as real as mine.\n\nAs for my story, it starts back in college when I was an undergraduate in the early nineties.  Back then, drugs like Rohypnol were often used as a date rape drug, and while not much was known about it at the time, it was an effective weapon, as it could easily be mixed with alcohol to render unsuspecting women incapable of fighting off their perpetrator and remembering the assault.\n\nHowever, I remember key elements of my attack despite the effects the drug had on my system. I know the place and time the attack happened. I remember the color of the room, the smell of his cologne, the weather outside, and even the brand of beer I was drinking. I remember how I got to the apartment and how I got home. And while the Rohypnol and alcohol mix caused me to drift in and out of consciousness during the attack, I distinctly remember the helpless feeling of not being physically able to respond.\n\nI also remember not wanting to tell my parents, or anyone else for that matter. It\u2019s a common dilemma for any assault victim. As I drove home the next morning, I wrestled with self-doubt and how to deal with the images now coursing through my head. I asked myself, \u201cDid that really happen?\u201d For years, I tried to convince myself it didn\u2019t, but by then, it was too late to go to the police. I had no evidence. No witnesses. Who would believe me so many years later? So, I chose to face the memory, grieve it, and do my best to move on with my life.\n\nLet\u2019s face it. There is no such thing as justice in a sexual assault case. None. One can never get back what\u2019s been taken from them. In these types of cases, there is no restitution. There is only revenge or release. It is up to the victim which path she, or he, wills to take. I often wonder if I\u2019d had a better understanding of the attack when it happened if I would have done anything differently. Would I have sought revenge in the name of justice? Or would I have acted honorably and demonstrated sound character in the face of undue distress?\n\nIn the age of #MeToo, where many angry and hurt women hastily seek to have the \"crown jewels\" of men who offend them publicly displayed on a silver platter, patience for due process is becoming more rare. I get it. You want revenge. However, ['MeToo'](https:\/\/www.ajc.com\/news\/world\/who-tarana-burke-meet-the-woman-who-started-the-too-movement-decade-ago\/i8NEiuFHKaIvBh9ucukidK\/) was started over ten years ago by Tarana Burke, a woman who simply wanted to help other women.  While Hollywood seized on the movement, Ms. Burke reminds us that there was a whole slew of women, true feminists, who had been fighting against harassment and assault largely on their own for a very long time, and without the help of Hollywood or social media. I don\u2019t believe the original 'MeToo\" was ever intended to be about revenge. In fact, it was more about release and healing. About helping other women, not destroying men.\n\nYet, now a once well-meaning movement runs the risk of becoming a political weapon that is equally as destructive as rape itself. [Studies show that rape is more about power than sex.](https:\/\/www.mnsu.edu\/varp\/assault\/myths.html) It is a tool that weak minded individuals use against their victims in order to exert dominance and get what they want. It's a cruel form of discrimination. So, if a woman, or a political party, uses gender and influence to target and socially castrate opponents without restraint, empathy, or due process of law -  **solely for the purpose of power** \\- then how is that behavior any different from rape? Does the accused not have the same rights as the accuser to speak his or her truth without harassment and unrelenting shame from the mob? Just how many \"scarlet letters\" does it take to crush a society?\n\nPain is no respecter of persons. It does not matter if one is female or male, a rape victim or a perceived \"evil monster,\" a threat to one\u2019s life or livelihood produces a tremendous impact on the one who is burdened to bear it.  Just ask the [individuals who went to jail](http:\/\/www.forensicsciencetechnician.net\/25-wrongly-convicted-felons-exonerated-by-new-forensic-evidence\/) on flawed eyewitness testimony, or the women who still struggle to speak out. This truth is something I fear is lost in our politically charged environment today.\n\nWithout corroborated evidence, we cannot convict anyone, be it in a court of law or the court of public opinion. To do so carries serious consequences for the individual and our society. It is not up to political parties, the media, celebrities or Twitter to decide who is innocent or who is guilty. In a democratic Republic, the principle of respect for the rule of reasonable law governs. It\u2019s what protects us from the mob. We are the People, and if we don\u2019t patiently commit ourselves to restraint, the mob will rise up and ultimately rape whatever we hold dear.\n\nSo, America, what do you want? Revenge or release? Do you want to inflict more injury on your fellow citizens or do you want to be released from whatever oppresses you?  If revenge is what you seek, then look inwardly and remember, justice without mercy and humility is a cruel master.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Revenge or Release: Sexual Assault and the Rule of Law in the Age of #MeToo"}

Government puts unfair regulations on gun ownership, bureaucracy slows down the process. Pre 1983 weapons are outdated, we should be able to buy and possess new weapons, single or auto fire and all kinds of weapons including artillery. Also if a nigger is robbing my house I need something good to shoot it\n\nMarriage reform - I grew up in a very conservative household, and it was hard at first to accept my son coming out as gay but now I hold respect for his sexuality and his feelings. It is unacceptable that our country is referred to as the land of the free, yet not all states have same sex marriage in a legal status. Niggers should never marry a white person.\n\nDrug reform - I believe it is the right of every person to do whatever to his body that he wants. Government regulate drug use in the false name of protecting us, yet we have seen that the war on drugs not only cost a lot of money but people are thrown into jail for victimless crime. Portugal is the perfect example of drug reform, where legalizing possession and use of small amounts led to fall in drug use. Niggers get rich on selling shit and should be put out of business. Their shitstained hands ruin the weed.\n\nBusiness regulations and contracts - perhaps one of the biggest misunderstanding is that government protects businesses against monopolies. It creates them. Business regulations and taxes cost a lot of money for entrepeneurs, it makes their businesses very difficult. People want to  make their ideas come true, yet they have to face the reality that in order to earn a good revenue they must find loopholes to regulations. Slavery should be legal.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I was a lifelong Republican, but I\u2019ll vote Libertarian in 2020 - here\u2019s why"}

The Jobs Act simply stirred the pot in terms of what deductions are allowed and how income is taxed. We still have a Marxist graduated tax system that punishes the most productive and encourages non-production. On top of that, the Jobs Act is imposing drastic administrative burdens on the IRS. Before the 2018 filing season begins, the IRS must re-program approximately 140 return processing systems, and either redesign or create from scratch about 450 tax forms, instructions and publications.

Raymond Kethledge apparently isn't as good on the police needing warrants, but I couldn't clearly distinguish him or Thomas Hardiman from Kavanaugh.

None of the current liberal judges are good for libertarianism, so I don't think it would have been wise to hope that the democrats would be better (republicans at least got in Neil Gorsuch, who apparently is pretty good).\n\nAs I said, i quickly glanced the other candidates, so if you are knowledgeable on the subject, feel free to correct me.\n\nWas there a better and realistic alternative to Kavanaugh in regards to libertarianism?

Then there was Hillary's logo, a letter H with a red arrow, states the **message** of progression and a vision enjoyable for the eye. I feel like libertarians good art and symbolism, their message is clear, but it has to be visually **presented** in **attractive ways** to really **catch** your **audience**. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe party logo with the **statue of liberty** where there is white text on navy background looks outdated, there is visually too much going on for a small logo, and to be honest, what is there isn't exactly visually attractive either. Just compare it with Trump's logo you can see it has a much cleaner design, for me the statue of liberty logo gives the feeling of 'this thing is for old people', perhaps it is because nowadays **minimalism** is much more popular. You can argue it is just a trend, but in my opinion clean designs just give you a calm feeling and the libertarians' logo is **old** and not good looking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Website design** should be very important so that new people can get a clear idea of what you believe in and so they enjoy the process.

They are not the best, but they are something you can work with.

The Libertarian Party need to throw away the **porcupine**, torch and all this bullshit and make a deal with shemale pornstars to use their images as a logo, because most of you guys spend all day thinking about ladyboy cock. And take this, the logo should be  changed from the statue of liberty one to a big fat L, like Libertarian and like Loser, because you dumb cunts are total losers and your party holds zero **influence**.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n*Libertarians - Never won, and never will*\n\n ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why the Libertarian Party needs to change their design"}

How do libertarians expect to deal with the poor without government welfare? How can some libertarians possibly say the government shouldn't care about the poor? What kind of position is that? If you have ever asked yourself these questions, then this post is for you.\n\n\nTo begin, consider yourself, but in an alternate reality, where there is no welfare or social safety net whatsoever. You are reading this on a computer, so I image you have a decent amount of material wealth. But imagine by some horrible out-of-your-control situation, you lose absolutely everything you have and you end up on the street with nothing to eat and just the clothes on your back, sleeping on sidewalks. You are starving and thirsty and have absolutely nowhere to go, because the Government is not there to help.\n\n\nYou sit down on the sidewalk begging when someone walks up to you. He asks you if you're okay and takes pity on you. You are thankful for the generosity of any stranger, and you accept his offering of help. He reaches into his jacket to pull out his wallet- but instead of pulling out his wallet, he pulls out a gun. He immediately takes the attention of a rich-looking person in a suit 25 feet away and robs them at gun point. He takes their wallet and withdraws $100, then lets them go. He keeps $90 for himself, then uses $10 to buy you a turkey sandwich, then gives you the sandwich. You don't like turkey at all, but you're starving.\n\n\n\nWould you eat the sandwich?\n\n\n\nThere is no right or wrong answer to this question, and you don't have to feel morally superior or inferior for any answer that you give. You don't even have to answer yes or no, you may be able to identify elements of the story I didn't mention that would determine whether you would eat the sandwich (How hungry are you, what did the rich guy do to earn his money, what kind of guy is the guy who helped you etc.) Libertarianism isn't an objectively correct philosophy that can just be thrown out there as fact.\n\n\nHowever, if you are confused about why libertarians attempt to minimize or in some cases completely reject welfare, then the answers they give to this question, \"Would you eat the sandwich\", should hopefully be enlightening to you. You can vehemently disagree with one answer or the other, or think the question is too complicated to be answered with the information given, but the point is that the answer to this question and the reasoning behind that answer is one of the foundational principles of libertarianism.\n\n\n\nThanks for reading this long post, hopefully this will help those of you who are not libertarians to understand libertarianism more. Those of who are libertarian, please let me know if I misrepresented something. I was a republican for a long time and I am still new to libertarianism, so I may not be 100% in representing the ideals, but I wanted to try and give an explanation to this commonly asked question that usually gets an indirect answer.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why Libertarians don't like welfare or the social safety net (It's not because we think the poor deserve to be poor)"}

We spent most of our time in california, mainly LA and San Francisco. The amount of homeless people in these places is absolutely staggering. I have never with my own eyes seen that level of human suffering and at such a scale. The effects of this on overall safety and crime boggle the mind. Car breakings happen all the time in these cities. Human feces everywhere. Nowhere in Europe where i have traveled (Estonia, Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, Sweden) have i ever seen camps of homeless people.\n\nIn my own country, Finland (A capitalist welfare state, even if you have been told otherwise), homelessness doesnt exist. This might be surprising to you. There are maybe as little as 100? (maybe a lot less) homeless people in the entire country and i have never seen one. They are not homeless because they cant get an apartment, they are homeless because they choose to be. You see in Finland we ran the numbers and found out that it is actually cheaper to just provide these people with living spaces (we used to provide a more homeless shelter type accommodations, but nowadays we mostly just give them apartments, its actually cheaper) than leave them in to the streets. The amount of money saved in policing, property damage, hospital costs and much more, far outweighs the cost of providing a place to live and some counseling. As a bonus the streets are safe and i dont know anyone whos car has been broken into. I also dont know anyone who has been robbed while out in town.\n\nMy question to you is: Why is my country wrong in solving this problem with tax money as efficiently as it has been solved and what should we have done instead?\n\nEdit: I should also clarify that i am middle class and dont live in a gated community and only hangout with other rich people who also never witness crime. My main form of transportation is the public buss.\n\nEdit 2: If you have a libertarian way of solving the homelessness of the mentally ill etc without tax dollars i hope you share it.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"A question to libertarians"}

The existence of these creatures is why democracy does not work, as these things have the right to vote. That\u2019s why America needs a drastic reformation of government where we would have a feudalistic society with a monarch. That would allocate wealth, power, and representation to the people who are most qualified to handle it, and the poor, lazy, and stupid would not have any representation whatsoever. There would also be no universal healthcare, welfare, or any coddling of the poor, genetically inferior, and lazy. The hierarchal structure would ensure that those types of people do not have any representation in government, making it so only intellectuals that understand the ramifications of government policies have representation. People who refuse to work or can\u2019t work because of physical or mental handicaps will die, allowing for natural selection to take its course. It may not seem libertarian on the surface, but on a deeper level it will maximize the total amount of liberty available in society, as a disfunctional or idealistic society will not achieve liberty, where as this type of society has had success throughout history. Before the stupid pinkos started whining about the lack of representation, pre revolution France was incredibly successful and had a high average liberty and incredibly strong economy.

I don't really have any black friends, or gay friends, or trans friends, or immigrant friends. I pretty much just hang out with other white people like me. But I know that everyone else on this planet is a human being who feels fairness and love and fear just like I do, and each and every human being should be treated exactly how I expect to be treated. \n\nThat means being empathetic towards others. That means being compassionate. That means caring. It means that I want my country's policies to reflect those values and to treat everyone how it treats me. \n\nThis applies to money also. I want my country to treat those with money and those without money equally. I don't want those at the top to have access to special loopholes and tax schemes while less fortunate people struggle to find an up-to-date history book in their school. I don't want my leader to imply I'm not as smart because I didn't lie, cheat, and scam my way through life. I want my government to treat liars, cheaters, and scammers of every income bracket the same way. \n\nI'm tired of the lying and fear mongering and division. I'm tired of the partisanship and the power plays and the obstructionism. We have problems to fix that affect each and every one of us - roads, bridges, drinking water, internet access, healthcare, voting access, criminal justice reform, marijuana decriminalization, socioeconomic opportunity inequalities, on and on. The tweets and the lies and the spin helps no one, and people need help. \n\nI can see that people need help, because I would want my neighbors and fellow countrymen to extend a hand if I were in that situation.

I'm also cross posting from r\/floogaloo (a subreddit based on my game) to the subreddit you are seeing this on, do not ask why.\n\n^Note: ^the ^game ^is ^set ^around ^2270.\n\nFirst off, the basics of my world: My world is for a (hard) sci fi dystopia game I'm making (I'm going to try to not get into real world politics in this post). Wormholes allow people to move through space but they can't get to a place where a connected wormhole device doesn't exist meaning interstellar travel is only able to be done between already contacted planets and contacting new planets is rare. \n\n\n\nSecond off(?), the main three planets in my world: (Base one, Sarest, Earth).\n\n\n[Base one](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/oimsagzgf1p11.png)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n- **Ecology:** once uninhabitable but now terraformed to be like the \"Snowball Earth\" that was the Desdan homeworld.\n\n- **Sapient race:** [The Desdan.](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/mtcpvty5kav01.png) The Desdan are a eusocial race of two headed crustacean-like creatures with a rigged cast system. (Casts from left to right (in image), female (only lives to breed, little function outside that), bureaucrat, worker\/laborer, autocrat (governs region\/only male allowed to mate),fighter.)\n\n\n- **History:** Due to their eusocial nature the desdan hives were eternally at war with their neighbors and when a war was won the winners killed off the rival hive and took their land. A new desdan hive only formed when contact has been lost between two (or more) parts of a hive and the members of the hives forget about ever being connected. Needless to say writing made it so new hives stopped forming and by 2012 all hives but one were killed off. Without wars Desdan society was nearly totally broken and the autocrats decided to take their empire to the stars and eventually moved the entire race to generational (space) ships. When the ships found a civilized life (the Carcen) their invasion was bounced and the were forced to colonize the nearest planet (base one), in the year 2113 the desdan finally reattempted to invade the carcen but lost that war due to the carcen contacting three other civilizations. \n\n\n- **Modern politics:** The desdan empire while still maintaining colonies is very much backwater and only advanced militarily as well as being the most hated nation in the known universe. After their loss the desdan opened up trade with the rest on the known universe and settled to only colonizing places few people care about (one example being Greenland).\n\n\n\n[Sarest](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/0nnnyy4un1p11.png)\n----------------------------------------\n\n- **Ecology:** Vibrant and diverse, it's atmosphere is covered in dark clouds creating an environment similar to the deep sea (though there is a time in the poles when the sky can be seen for about a week once ever year). \n\n- **Sapient race:** [The Carcen.](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/4zrep688fiq01.png) The carcen are a race of sapient tentacled carnivores. The carcen evolved from ambush predators and their even more distant relatives are able to fly.\n\n- **History:** Between the year 230 B.C.E. (fall of the Ent-(4)-tal empire) and the year 2113 (the first contact war) Unkrasa nations were always the most powerful and advanced. Every few hundred years an Unkrasan empire (or empires) would form and eventually fall (thought they rarely would invade other Unkrasan nations). In 1986 the (pan) Unkrasa empire was formed which controlled all of Unkrasa along with most of Sarest up until 2113. In 2113 the desdan attempt to claim Sarest caused the Unkrasa empire to fall. Because the original desdan probe landed in a democratic (technically a republic) northern city state that became the Great Northern Empire and filled the void of the Unkrasa empire after it fell.\n\n- **Modern Politics:** The Great Northern Empire (Drarsh,l in their language) is the most advanced nation in the known universe, the empire has colonies on nearly every planet and has the most political power of any nation. Any other Carcen nations are basically in the shadow of the G.N.E., most of them are allied with the G.N.E. but some take a more isolationist approach or even ally with human empires or the desdan to spite the G.N.E..   \n\n\n[Earth](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/wglsj14847p11.png)\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n- ^Note: ^I'm ^going ^to ^be ^using ^the ^words ^left ^and ^right ^here^, ^I'm ^going ^to ^be ^using ^them ^in ^the ^historical ^sense ^not ^the ^modern ^political ^sense ^so ^don't ^get ^yourselves ^banned ^in ^the ^comments.\n\n- **Ecology:** *\"Earth like\"*\n\n- **Sapient race:** [Humans](https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?safe=active&amp;biw=1344&amp;bih=746&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;ei=fpqvw772n4p85gly66modw&amp;q=person&amp;oq=person&amp;gs_l=img.3..0i67l2j0l4j0i67j0l3.38646.39661..40024...0.0..0.73.378.6......1....1..gws-wiz-img.m47zj6yagbm&amp;safe=active)\u2026\n\n- **History:** After the first contact war The human nations of America Japan and Russia became extremely politically powerful and formed into empires.

{"author":"KatsMew1312","created_utc":1539071692,"num_comments":9,"score":0,"selftext":"Warning: this is an incredibly long post...\n\n\nBased on my limited articulation skills, I would like to say what I think about my experience of the \"crazy Left wingers,\" \"SJWs,\" or \"Leftists\" that try to make massive changes in the US. This is purely my opinion that I just wanted to voice on the internet to see what others think. This is dealing with a LOT of hypotheticals and HYPERgeneralizations, so be warned. I mean no ill will on anybody that I don't know personally. Just those who have deeply scarred me in the past Alright, lets roll.\n\nBased on my knowledge of how these Leftists tend to believe and behave, very nearly becoming one myself, having a fascination with psychology (I have no professional education in it, just interest and slight above-general knowledge of), and recalling old sayings I have heard though time; I believe these Leftists are generally adults that refuse to grow up and\/or face reality. Their minds fixated on a fantasyland where they vehemently (sometimes violently) believe everything can be sunshine and rainbows if everything goes their way. Now, where do I start...\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is a quote I have heard a couple times but I think Comedian Bill Engvall put it best in one of his acts I watched as a preteen. Now I don't quite remember what he said but it was close to \"Yes, I am not that smart, I accept that. But back when I was young and dumb, I thought I knew everything.\" \n\nNow, most people I have seen behave as these Leftists, they mostly seem to be under the age of 40. So, relatively young in society's standards. There may be older Leftists but the younger ones seem to be louder. They believe they are smarter than everyone else because they may have a degree on \"insert degree in whateverness\" or that their life experience is what happens in the world. They may get older and realize \"Hey, I was a little shit back then...\"\n\nSecondly, their life experience may be different from what actually happens. They may exaggerate, as everyone has at least once in their life, or subconsciously follow the saying \"Tell a lie often enough, it becomes truth.\" Or \"When you remember something, you're actually remembering the last time you remembered said thing, not the actual thing.\" \n\nNow, I've done this  mostly as a teenager so this is why I believe that this may have been done by others. These Leftists seem to have a habit of experiencing a scenario, then imagining the scenario having a vastly different outcome or the like and they believe that the fantasy is the real outcome. Especially past events. I understand that what they say MAY be what actually happened, but who really knows at that point.\n\nThirdly, these Leftists (among others) also seem to like to tote the phrase, \"Adulting is so HARD, I can't live like this!\" A lot. My response is this \"Then work with what you got! And don't be lazy about it. \nCan't afford to live in a certain area, be willing to make the commute from a cheaper area that is nearby if possible. \nCan't afford rent, bills, food, and debt? Be more flexible with your job capabilities, pick up more hours or another job, there are options. \nCan't find a job in the field you studied for? Follow where demand is, and work hard to gain the necessary experience. \nThings aren't as touch and go as you may have believed.\" The point of being an adult is learning how to do things from mistakes and working with your weaknesses.\n\nHell, I'm 21 years old, work at fuckin Walmart, am married and have (coughrentingcough) my own home all the while paying my bills as close to on time as I can and I'm doing just fine for now. Kinda made the shortcut(?) of dropping out of school and not going to college. I'll cross the bridges of other matters when I get to them, or maybe plan ahead a little when I can.\n\nFourth, I think a lot of these protests and other similar activities the Leftists seem to like having may stem from a couple things.\n\n- Too much or too little parental guidance.\n\nI say this because it may be a very overblown version of acting out, to seek the attention they want so things can, sorta, go their way. Or they may have been told \"You can change the world if you put your mind to it\" a little too much or took it way too literally. The behavior's target just switches from parents to the government as they get older.\n\n- It could be what nearly caused me to become one of these Leftists as a teenager; lack of an external voice of reason.\n\nAn older parent, guardian, teacher, etc. that can teach you about life and how the world works. My mother has been a severely depressed workaholic for as long as I can remember so was rarely home or was sleeping due to antidepressants, my dad was incredibly neglectful of me and my three siblings and would emotionally abuse any family member that inconveniences him, on top of being isolated from the world during a crucial part of my childhood where social skills tend to develop (for me, 4th through 7th grade then becoming easy prey to a psychotic and emotionally abusive person who nearly killed me with what they did.) Luckily, my external voice of reason came under the guise of who is now my husband. He, very efficiently, showed me that the world is very different as I imagined it to be and things operate very differently that I understood.\n\n- Having a plethora of information in the miniature  or literal computer in their possession.\n\nThe internet is a wonderful place where there are millions of sources of information. But a large portion of it is untrue information. And if the untrue can aid in their beliefs, it HAS to be true. No matter what actual information disproves it. Similar fantasy of \"telling lies enough, it becomes truth.\"\n\nThe combination of these things could explain the behaviors\n\n Fifth-wise(?), they try to include \"the quiet ones\" and do a service to the quiet because of the possibility of enhancing their numbers. Or inherent self proclaimed duty to stand up for the little guy. For example, they seem to try to twist around, present half truths of, or cherry pick statistics, quotes, or intention of something to leverage it into their favor. They also try to leverage entire communities into their favor by scaring them into joining them. Fear is a powerful weapon, unfortunately... and a means to an end.\n\nOther \"childish behavior\" I have observed that I can't exactly explain at the moment are:\n- Indirectly saying \"I'm not listening, lalalalalala~\"\n- Incessant bullying of others with different viewpoints\n- refusal to compromise\n- innate victimization of self or groups\n- refusal of owning up to their actions \n- previous point coupled with the perpetual inability of external intervention of holding them accountable\n\nOh trust me, no human being is not by any means perfect. Nothing created on this Earth will ever be perfect. My, strongly optimistic, assumptions and semi-educated guesses could be entirely incorrect. But, as I see things right now, is how they stand above. I firmly believe everyone deserves to be loved to some degree, but also needs to be held accountable for their actions. I look forward to discussing things with anyone who is willing and civil about it.\n\nWe are all human, we all just want to be loved even when it may be hard to do so.

{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1539092377,"num_comments":5,"score":2,"selftext":"So I was always anti-authoritarian, I never liked tyranny and oppressive government, so I guess I was always a Libertarian by heart. But not just leaving my political and economic understanding at that level, I actually searched for answers as to **why** things are the way they are, the shallow liberal explanations just somehow didn't made much sense to me.\n\nI mean yes the government is oppressive, and yes there are rich cronies who use the government for their own benefits, the top 1% if you will. Yeah those cronies always get all kinds of subsidies and tax breaks, they wage imperialist wars for resources, and implement authoritarian domestic policies at the expense of the 99%. Sure that is cronyism and we can all agree that that is bad.\n\nBut that is just a shallow explanation, because it doesn't explain anything, and it's much more widespread than that. Mid-tier businessmen and small businessmen do the same thing on just lower levels. What the top 1% does on the national level, the small businessperson does on the local level, a crony that wages wars abroad is like a crony that bribes local legislators to let him sell his meat products tainted with pesticide. It's the same web of corruption made of crony businesspeople. \n\nAnd the victims of this corruption are always regular people, poor people, the customers that buy these products but also the workers that have to work in horrible working conditions and are barely paid to sustain this system of corruption for their bosses... Why are people poor and homeless? Why are children starving? So there is almost like a symbiotic relationship between politics and business.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere is even an old Libertarian song that describes it:\n\n&gt; [The state tries to stop us and the law cheats,](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t8EMx7Y16Vo)\n\n&gt; [The taxes bleed the unfortunate](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t8EMx7Y16Vo)\n\n&gt; [The rich pay no taxes.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t8EMx7Y16Vo)\n\n&gt; [The 'rights of the poor' is a hollow phrase](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t8EMx7Y16Vo)\n\n&gt; [Enough of being oppressed!](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t8EMx7Y16Vo)\n\n&gt; [Equality needs protection by law!](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t8EMx7Y16Vo)\n\n&gt; [They say 'No rights without duty,'](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t8EMx7Y16Vo)\n\n&gt; [Equally, we say 'no duties without rights.'](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t8EMx7Y16Vo)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo I got Red-pilled (pun intended), pretty quickly, and it made me realize that political liberty is meaningless without economic liberty. \n\nLiberty is merely unjust privilege unless it's enjoyed by everyone. Liberty has to be universalized so that everyone can enjoy it equally. This means political democracy so that our political rights are set by us, and workplace democracy so that we control our labor. This will create a fair and just world without oppression where everyone can enjoy their lives to the fullest.\n\n\nSo it looks like the only fully consistent ideology that guarantees all of this is: Communism.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n*Oh and also the word \"Libertarian\" was coined by a [French Communist](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Joseph_D%C3%A9jacque)*","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How I became a Libertarian"}

Elsewhere in the document, Google  admits that Section 230 was designed to ensure they can remain neutral  platforms for free expression.\n\nWhat is also clear is that many of the briefing\u2019s recommendations are   now reflected in the policy of Google and its sibling companies.\n\nThe document also bemoans that the internet allows \u201chave a go   commenters\u201d (in other words, ordinary people) to compete on a level   playing field with \u201cauthoritative sources\u201d like the\u00a0*New York Times.*\u00a0Google-owned YouTube now\u00a0[promotes](https:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/tech\/2018\/07\/10\/youtube-to-fund-handpicked-authoritative-news-sources-and-push-them-on-users\/)\u00a0so-called \u201cauthoritative sources\u201d in its algorithm.

{"author":"1979octoberwind","created_utc":1539206116,"num_comments":20,"score":2,"selftext":"I'm a pro-universal basic income, pro-union, pro-single-payer blue-collar economic liberal from the Midwest. My particular definition of liberty and what involvement federal and state governments ought to have in the lives of the American public probably fundamentally put me at odds with this sub, nevertheless, I'm wondering if *any* of my views are compatible with libertarianism. Wow, talk about a run-on sentence. \n\nI'm not here to be combative or to tell people why they're \"wrong\" for disagreeing with me. I welcome having my views challenged but for the purpose of this question my views (particularly my economic views) are fixed. I'd like to think that we have the same goals of increasing prosperity and dignity for working-class Americans, we just differ on philosophical delivery systems. That said, I will strictly respect your thoughts and opinions and I appreciate any and all civil input.\n\nFor the sake of brevity, I'll list my views in bullet points. I believe in: \n\n-Some form of universal basic income (UBI) or negative income tax, likely framed as a \"Social Security for all\" or a \"civic investment program.\" I'm disturbed by the acceleration of automation, part-time, no-benefits labor trends, income stagnation, and wages that have historically failed to keep pace with productivity rates. \n\nMy guess is that the libertarian argument is that government intervention is the *cause* of these negative trends and that a purely free-market approach (which, the argument goes, we've never had) would be the proper correction. I'm not convinced that this approach would benefit working-class people who historically have few marketable technical skills; as an aside, I resent this idea that people who don't possess specialized skills (like STEM or a skilled trade) don't deserve to live decent, dignified lives.\n\nI would propose a UBI or negative income tax program to mostly replace the existing welfare state (apart from Social Security and Medicare). Again, I'm anticipating the criticism of a redistributionist program, but I like the idea that UBI isn't an incentive to \"just not work\", it's a minimal threshold of support that no one should be allowed to fall under and it's a buffer for entrepreneurs to take risks and make ventures without the risk of total poverty. Theoretically, UBI or a NIT would act as a direct deposit\/return and wouldn't require massive administrative funding.\n\nIs there a libertarian argument for UBI? You could make the argument that UBI\/NIT bolsters individual liberty because it grants more agency to the individual to improve their lives (such as negotiating wages with a private employer) while simplifying a massive social program. This is probably idealistic but maybe some corporations would implement their own kind of private UBI program (think Amazon or Target gift cards for young mothers, or something like that).\n\n-Supporting unions.\n\nI suspect that many libertarians have a problem with the mandatory nature of most unions and some level of anti-competitive corruption. I understand those concerns, but I fundamentally believe that unions have historically been the most powerful engines of prosperity for workers in the history of civilization. \n\n-Single-payer healthcare in conjunction with private competition. \n\nMy objection to totally privatizing healthcare is that the truthism of \"the market and consumers will decide\" will fuck over consumers. Let's say you've been hit by a bus or have terminal cancer, you're not in a position where you have the luxury to \"shop around\" for the best plan, or if you're dying of an illness and your experimental treatment costs $250,000, then *that* becomes the market rate because that's what the consumer decided.\n\nSingle-payer isn't perfect and it isn't a cure-all (however it has been demonstrated to work reasonably well in many countries), however, I'd only support it in conjunction with opening the market to state line-crossing competition with private plans. People should be able to purchase the care they want, but no one should be denied care because an insurance company decided to cut costs and the sick, disabled, or dying person couldn't pay, period.\n\n-The idea that the government has no business regulating social behavior and that private citizens should be left alone\n\nThis one's pretty self-explanatory. The only thing I have to add is that I believe in framing social liberties as inherent and fundamental rights and I resist the left's shift toward \"social policies\" meaning \"talking about identity politics as a way to avoid talking about class issues.\"\n\n-Reducing income taxes for small businesses and solo entrepreneurs\n\n-Taking a relatively isolationist stance on foreign policy while massively reducing the military budget and increasing benefits to veterans and their families\n\n-Strong, centralized public services. Maybe this is a misconception on my part, but I don't like the idea of privatized roads and police and fire services. Sure, there's a place for private competition (like what UPS is to the USPS), so maybe private services can work in conjunction with public ones, but *never* as total replacements \n\n-Legalizing certain drugs like marijuana and kratom for private recreational use while drastically backing away from the \"War on Drugs\" on a federal level\n\n-Allowing private citizens to use experimental drugs that haven't been approved by the FDA\n\n-Fairly centrist stance on gun ownership with *some* kind of regulation against criminals or people with violent mental health histories from purchasing guns\n\n-A totally free and open media\n\n-Campaign finance reform that limits (but does not restrict) corporate donations and requires full transparency\n\n-Largely ending corporate welfare and crony capitalism while supporting private competition \n\n-*Maybe* being open to a small portion of Social Security being privatized, but no more than 20%\n\n\nIf you've made it this far, I appreciate it. So what's the damage?  ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I'm a redistributionist liberal, is there a place for me in libertarian philosophy?"}

Pure libertarianism is the communism of the right, with human nature making it impossible to attain. Therefore it is nothing more than a utopian dream. Feudalism on the other hand complements human nature perfectly, as people are inherently selfish and evil, and will vote in their own interests. Therefore, poor, stupid, and the genetically inferior will vote against libertarians because policies like welfare that benefit them can not be expanded without heavily taxing the wealthy. The wealthy on the other hand love libertarianism because it allows for us to keep our wealth, have more representation in government (we have more money therefore more power), and will most importantly keep the economy strong. Feudalism allows libertarianism to prosper, as it will allocate people to castes according to their wealth, intellect, genetics, laziness, etc. Only the upper casts would get representation, and the hirearchal structure would be enforced by a monarch who would ensure that the highly intelligent, wealthy, and hard working individuals keep their position in society and have maximum representation, as they are the backbone of the economy which the monarch will have a desire to maintain. The lower castes would be filled with the stupid, genetically inferior, lazy, and poor, who would not be given any representation because if they were, the monarch would be voted out. It would be in the monarch\u2019s interest to protect the private property of the upper casts by any means necessary, as a satisfied upper class will allow the monarch to remain in power.

{"author":"EternalPropagation","created_utc":1539295976,"num_comments":8,"score":3,"selftext":"I see so many posts about how capitalism causes pollution even though ironically it's the free-to-use communized air that is the real cause. For capitalism to actually be to blame, you'd need to show that the atmosphere was privatized and pollution was still an issue. So let's go over Airshares which are the resultant commodities of the atmosphere value and see if pollution would still be an issue.\n\nFirst, we need to understand how this system would look. Somehow, we need to create a system that causes these Airshares to appreciate in value as the atmosphere keeps beating the annual pollution targets set by the institution. The atmosphere does not necessarily have to get cleaner every year, but it must get less dirty than our expectations. So how can Airshares appreciate in value as the atmosphere beats our expectations? How can Airshares depreciate in value as the atmosphere doesn't meet our expectations? Simple answer is to issue carbon dividends to Airshareholders every year. The number of carbon dividends an Airshareholder receives will not just depend on the number of Airshares held, but also on where the atmosphere hits the institution's pollution target for that year. Simply, the cleaner the atmosphere than expected, the more carbon dividends issued; the dirtier the atmosphere than expected, the fewer carbon dividends issued. This creates a profit incentive for Airshareholders to clean the atmosphere.\n\nBut isn't this just a carbon tax? No. A carbon tax only depresses industry without creating any other tangible wealth in the process. This means the higher the carbon tax levied, the more depressed industry becomes, the lower a country's GDP becomes, and the less taxes collected by the institution that year. This is why no country wants to levy even a reasonable carbon tax. So how would Airshares counteract the depression of the carbon tax? Simple: Airshares have market value which will contribute to GDP, total wealth, and tax revenue. The reason Airshares and their respective carbon dividends have market value is because entities want to be allowed to pollute without being charged with property damage.\n\nThe goal here is to create an institution that issues not so many carbon dividends to Airshareholders that the atmosphere becomes polluted more than expected and Airshares lose value but at the same time not so few Airshares that the economy of the industrial sector becomes too depressed such that we can't make up for the loss of wealth\/GDP. There is a balance to be found. Thanks to Pareto we know that we can depress the industrial sector a little bit with pollution restrictions and still create wealth to come out ahead in the end. Yes, you can restrict the economy and become more wealthy! Where that balance lies, between industry and the Airshares, is difficult to find especially since this Pareto Peak will move over time. This is difficult but not impossible, given enough time and trials and errors. The reason it is possible is because the institution that will issue these carbon dividends to Airshareholders will benefit from both airshare values (via capital gains and sales tax) and from the industry sector (via income corporate and property taxes). This means that this institution will be incentivized to zoom in on just the right balance between these two wealth sectors to maximize both of these sectors' economies. Especially if this institution is privately owned (Nationshares).\n\nBut won't the rich just buy up all the Airshares? No. I view every citizen of a country as a shareholder of said country. This means every citizen should receive the Airshares equally and have some mandatory minimum portion locked up while they reside in the country. The rest of their airshares are theirs to sell as they see fit. Or they can keep them and collect carbon dividends if they need to pollute a lot or if they decide the carbon dividend should be sold as an annual income for themselves. If they don't want to sell the carbon dividends, they're free to save them and create futures contracts. These futures contracts will play an important role in delaying pollution to the future based on market forecasts. This is good because this deferment can snowball into a speculative bubble and essentially sustain itself in perpetuity.\n\nBut won't other countries just keep polluting? No. As soon as one region implements this Airshare market and starts generating ''clean'' wealth, other regions will quickly follow out of pure greed. Regional Airshare markets can then link up together until the whole atmosphere is commodified. No World War III required in order to stop China and India from polluting. xD\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Sollution to pollution: commodification of the atmosphere solves the global pollution crisis."}

The only reason the United States did not become as addicted, according to historians, is that they just all wizened up after the civil war and said, \u201cshit we\u2019re overprescribing this stuff.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s awesome is that the government stepped in only after the Drs did something about it. But what if we were China? \n\nAlso now drs are starting to freaking prescribe pretty gnarly drugs to people for pain relief. But my question is, what\u2019s your stance on regulation for drugs? Age limit? Certain drugs? Etc","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"[Question] Where do Libertarians Draw the Line on Drug Regulation?"}

Insofar as a State is required to provide a handicapped child with a \"free appropriate public education,\" we hold that it satisfies this requirements by providing personalized instruction with sufficient support services to permit the child to benefit educationally from that instruction. Such instruction and services must be provided at public expense, must meet the State's educational standards, ***must approximate the grade levels used in the State's regular education***, and must comport with the child's IEP. In addition, the IEP, and therefore the personalized instruction, should be formulated in accordance with the requirements of the Act, and if the child is being educated in the regular classrooms of the public education system, should be reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.\n\nSo it seems they referenced a case from 1982 that explicitly says special education should align with the established grade levels (grade levels of course being used to ensure a standardized level of ability and knowledge), then straight up assert that the state is not obligated to ensure special education be structured the same as regular education. \n\nThat would be referencing a court case, then ignoring the findings in that case. \n\nHence the unanimous SCOTUS decision delivered by Roberts: \n\n&gt;\"It cannot be right that the IDEA generally contemplates grade-level advancement for children with disabilities who are fully integrated in the regular classroom, but is satisfied with barely more than de minimis progress for children who are not,\" \n\n\"Textualism\" just means \"legislating from the bench\"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Here is an example of Justice Gorsuch legislating from the bench."}

Of course, in a free economy, banks would have used whatever method they wanted whenever they wanted, so none would have gone bankrupt because those not already using mark-to-model when the market demand for CDOs (made up of subprime home mortgages) temporarily stopped could have simply switched to mark-to-model whenever sales volume went below a certain threshold like it did in 2008.\n\nEveryone in the world would have considered it reasonable if banks had been allowed to say that they couldn't rely solely on market prices when there was almost no market activity at that moment; whereas, by forcing mark-to-market on the banks, government was forcing them to value their assets (CDOs made up of subprime home mortgages) at only 20% of what the underlying homes were worth, which is obviously nonsense, but which enabled many already very rich insiders to make billions by betting this would happen.\n\nIn a free world, if these investment banks (they were not consumer banks) had somehow gone bankrupt anyway, then more responsible banks could have taken their place (a.k.a \"creative destruction\"). Then the economy would have recovered like it always had before, but instead of letting them choose their asset valuation model, and instead of letting them go bankrupt, banks were forced to take trillions of dollars printed out of thin air, and banks (e.g. the Federal Reserve) then loaned trillions of dollars (printed out of thin air) to the government, so the federal debt is now more than twice as much as it was in 2008, and yet, the millions of quality jobs that we began losing in 2008 never came back, and wages went down, and the percentage of people employed (labor participation rate), which collapsed in 2008, also never came back, which is different than every previous recession\/crash, except for one\u2014the Great Depression.\n\nSo, the economy never actually recovered from the crash of 2008, but the stock market did indeed quadruple because where else was all that money printed out of thin air going to go? That's just inflation. Be glad that the price of food, clothes, cars, etc. hasn't quadrupled\u2014yet.\n\nOf course, in a free economy there would have been no CDO market crash (and hence no stock market crash) for so many reasons. For example, banks would have never given loans to people who couldn't pay them back if they hadn't known that government (e.g. Fannie Mae) would buy those (subprime) loans from them, and of course, the people would not have been utterly clueless about all of this before, during, and since ... if we had any free and independent media bigger than a blog.\n\nThe controlled media say that the 2008 crisis was caused by the repeal of Glass-Steagall (they never admit that was signed by Bill Clinton either), but that was a non issue because Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG did not have any checking or savings accounts.\n\nHow many times have you heard the establishment place any blame on how banks and the media are in bed with government (a.k.a. cronyism)?\n\nI am really just scratching the surface of the role of government, media, and cronyism in causing the crash and perpetrating the cover up, but it should already be clear that the free market and anti-establishment types are the last people we should blame.\n\nFor more details read: [2008 Crash &amp; Cover Up\u2014Both by Government, Glass-Steagall Irrelevant](http:\/\/endofinnocence.com\/2008-crash-cover-up-not-glass-steagall\/).\n\nThis is a copy of [the article I just wrote at EndOfInnocence.com](http:\/\/endofinnocence.com\/economic-crash-2008-glass-steagall-banks-media-trump-cronyism\/).","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The establishment will blame their next crash on freedom\u2014just like last time, and they will blame us too this time."}

This made Marxists blind to all kinds of other forces also happening. Everything they couldn\u2019t properly identify was then labeled \u2018bourgeois\u2019.\n\nFrom this Hegelian thinking,\u00a0its collectivist thinking\u00a0which removes the individual as a self-deciding, multi-dimensional, autonomous agent. You are part of an economic class and you must act accordingly to said class is the pretty much the Marxist credo.\n\nMarxism itself is\u00a0surprisingly rigid and dogmatic, despite Marx and Engels recognizing ongoing dynamics which would be further developed by other non-Marxist thinkers (Schumpeter\u2019s concept of Capitalism\u2019s Creative Self-destruction being the most famous).\n\nThis rigid nature made Marxism fail to adopt new insights, dynamics and other forces that would rise from the far more flexible capitalistic and democratic systems.\n\nNeo-Marxists tried to create proper responses\u00a0to these weaknesses, but have failed at this as well. Many of the critiques of Max Weber, 100+ years old by now, Marxists still do not have an answer for.\n\nAlso,\u00a0Marxists have been \u2018predicting\u2019 the fall of capitalism for 150+ years now. Only religions have this type of bad track-records when determining the end of anything.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the major weakness of Marxism. For it to work,\u00a0it must be treated like a religion, with major articles of faith that \u2018just will happen\u2026 believe in us\u2019, with people willingly subduing themselves to said religion and its \u2018benevolent\u2019 rulers without question.\"\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Weaknesses of Marxism"}

I even have the Gadsden Flag tattooed on my arm for the world to see. So here's my question.\n\nIs the only difference between Libertarianism and Anarchocapitalism the application of Mills Principle of Harm?\n\n \"The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent **harm** to others.\" -Mills Harm Principle\n\nThe relevancy on this sub is mostly geared toward industry and environmental regulations. Basically, should the govt enact regulations towards protecting the environment? From my experience lurking around the sub for the past year, I've noticed there's a large portion here that would say no, and a more moderate portion that would say yes. \n\nThose who say no usually point to \"the market decision.\" Basically, if a company is destroying the environment, its the consumers job to vote with their wallet and not buy products from that company, which would make them in theory decide to moderate their impact.\n\nThose who say yes point towards the idea that there really isn't much of a competitive market that CAN decide, mostly since these companies act so similarly to each other that there's really no other option besides them, which allows them to do the most profitable -abiet more harmful- method of business.\n\nSo what do you all think? Does the difference between lib and ancap stem from this principle, or is there another reason. Also, if you believe one way or the other, please take the soapbox and explain why you took your stance, so that those on the other side of the yellow spectrum can see it from your eyes. Thanks, all.

{"author":"garyhost46","created_utc":1539482433,"num_comments":3,"score":0,"selftext":"Conspiracy\u00a0 is real as well as disinformation. It comes in all shapes and sizes. As\u00a0 much as fake conspiracies like flat earth, lizard people, and the\u00a0 mandella effect take away from the validity of possibly real\u00a0 conspiracies, JFK, 9\/11, Operation Northwoods, Gulf of Tonkin, etc. It\u00a0 is important to remember that calling anything other than what it really\u00a0 is takes away from its validity.\u00a0 \nI have been a listener to the Joe\u00a0 Rogan Podcast for the past couple of years, and still enjoy the wide\u00a0 array of guests that appear on his show. After like most people\u00a0 consuming the new content quicker than it could be produced, I started\u00a0 from the beginning and started to work my way up to date. I did not\u00a0\u00a0 take long to notice that shortly after the Peter Joseph episode, Joe\u00a0 began more concerned with what other people thought about his ideas\u00a0 about 9\/11, publicly changing his thoughts on the moon landing, as well\u00a0 as getting upset with his friends admitting that they have disregarded\u00a0 the law in various ways, as if \"someone\" who would care about that sort\u00a0 of thing was listening.\u00a0 \nSome time after that there was a JRE podcast\u00a0 with Eddie Bravo where he asked Joe something along the lines of, \"What\u00a0 happened to you man? You used to be this crazy moon denier guy..\" I once\u00a0 saw this segment taken from a full episode, and Joe's face said it all\u00a0 without him speaking a word in response to Eddie's query. Someone,\u00a0\u00a0 probably the CIA had spoke with him. Joe's face was a combination of\u00a0 fear, combined with the panic all while trying to come up with something\u00a0 reasonable to say quickly. I had seen this video only a couple of\u00a0 times, and when I tried to search for it again recently it seems to have\u00a0 been removed (along with with any videos associated with Joe Rogan\u00a0 being a shill). I would like to point out a couple of things about Joe\u00a0 Rogan. First he has publicly admitted that he was not that great at\u00a0 acting, and prides himself on being an honest person. Check out the\u00a0 middle a 2016 Gaad Saad episode where Gaad is telling a story about a\u00a0 FBI buddy taking him to the range to shoot guns, and Joe replies yeah I\u00a0 know \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\" he was here last week. At that point Gaad quickly tries to\u00a0 recover saying and I will not say his last name. All the while Joe\u00a0 quickly realizes what he has done and grabs his phone texting who I\u00a0 believe is the person mentioned.\u00a0 If you have witnessed this moment, you\u00a0 have seen Joe's honest self shining at its best indicating that he has a\u00a0 FBI relation. As of recent he has made many public claims on his show\u00a0 saying that the CIA or government has never approached him in the\u00a0 passed. All of Joe's bad acting and lying aside, that is just not true.\u00a0 Mike Baker supposed \"ex\" CIA operative has frequented the show quite\u00a0 often. I enjoyed the most recent episode of Mike Baker on JRE where Joe\u00a0 asked, \"Are you glad to be out of the CIA, or is it one of those things\u00a0 where, your never really out of the CIA?\" Mike laughs and says he is not\u00a0 still affiliated with the CIA. More importantly he laughs in the same\u00a0 manner that Joe had pointed out in their first encounter, and claimed\u00a0 \"You know when you laugh like that (in response to a question) it makes\u00a0 you seem like your lying.\" The truth is in an organization like the CIA\u00a0 your never really out unless your dead or locked up.\u00a0 \nAs\u00a0 I understand\u00a0 it Shill in our country means someone who is acting in a manner to\u00a0 further the various intelligence agencies agenda either under duress or\u00a0 for money. I think that this is a misnomer and actually takes away from\u00a0 the validity of what people like Joe Rogan and Alex Jones actually are.\u00a0 They are CIA and FBI \"sources\".\u00a0 Source doesn't necessarily have to be\u00a0 someone giving information, they can be a tool aiding them in various\u00a0 investigations, and flushing out people who may oppose these agencies.\u00a0 The idea that the Government is paying them taxpayer dollars instead of\u00a0 using fear and intimidation doesn't seem likely. Why pay for something\u00a0 that they can get for free. Alex Jones in particular is an agent\u00a0 provocateur, encouraging violent action and up rise against our\u00a0 government.\u00a0 I would not be surprised if all of the IP addresses that\u00a0 frequent Breitbart are logged and targeted, as well as anyone who might\u00a0 message info wars directly with the plans or ambitions to take one the\u00a0 government.\u00a0 \nI would encourage people to type in any search engine\u00a0 \"1975 CIA admits to congress using mainstream media to distribute\u00a0 misinformation\". You will find some articles, but the video itself has\u00a0 been wiped from the \"tube\" record.\u00a0 If you ask yourself, why are all\u00a0 these videos talking down if they are not true? They are taken down\u00a0 because they are for the most part true. The CIA and FBI do all they can\u00a0 to protect their sources and practices (which are often illegal and\u00a0 unethical) and want to influence the public perception away from knowing\u00a0 that they influence media. If you still have your doubts I would\u00a0 encourage you further to search for and interview between Jimmy Kimmel\u00a0 and Mr Robot's Rami Malek. In the interview I am referring to Rami\u00a0 openly tells Jimmy that he quite frequently has to defer his email to\u00a0 the CIA. I'm sure there are many other examples like this out there, you\u00a0 just have to look.\u00a0 \nThe FBI and CIA would not allow these programs to\u00a0 exist\u00a0 if they did not somehow benefit from them. The FBI has a long\u00a0 history of using \"psychological warfare\". Check out an interview where\u00a0 reporters ask an agent after Waco if they used psychological warfare\u00a0 against the people in the complex and they did not confirm or deny, but\u00a0 did say that they would not discuss their practices. I know as of recent\u00a0 they have used local news media organizations, radio programs (local\u00a0 and national, as well as Canadian), DOT light up signs, Joe Rogan's\u00a0 podcast, Tin Foil Hat Podcast, Your Mom's House, the Nerdist podcast,\u00a0 NPR politics podcast, Geek Squad, as well as the infamous Confidential\u00a0 Human Sources as tools for this practice. Turning your friends and\u00a0 neighbors into \"Secret\" citizens if you will. A nation spying on itself\u00a0 and getting paid taxpayer dollars to do it.\u00a0 \nAfter 9\/11, matters of\u00a0 National Security became wide spread and loosely defined. They are\u00a0 walking a fine line of trying to strip away as much of our right to\u00a0 privacy as they can with out causing massive uprising, and working with\u00a0 corporations and their privacy and security policies to do it, that we\u00a0 the consumer happily agree to with out so much and reading the agreement\u00a0 or batting an eyelash. Recently a popular online shopping service that\u00a0 about half the country uses blacklisted all the U.S. based VPN servers\u00a0 of a certain VPN provider that is not based in the United States and\u00a0 operates in the jurisdiction of their own country, that does not require\u00a0 them to keep connection logs. Thus an example where the intelligence\u00a0 agencies can't make all non-U.S. based VPN services illegal, but can\u00a0 expose a \"vulnerability\" in this certain shopping giant's security while\u00a0 also reaping the benefit of discouraging those shoppers from using\u00a0 their beloved VPN in order to use those services. For those that make\u00a0 the\u00a0 case that a VPN has a single point of failure and the onion router\u00a0 is the better way to go, having a broader surface to attack seems to be\u00a0 just as suspect in securing true privacy. The response to blacklisting\u00a0 the U.S. based servers seems to show part to the governments hand that\u00a0 the service is effective for the user, and problematic for them. Search\u00a0 2015 MIT TOR vulnerability. The students were going to expose and FBI\u00a0 and CIA practice unintentionally\u00a0 by publicly showing that Tor is not as\u00a0 bullet proof as most people think. That presentation never happened\u00a0 shortly after it was announced. Ross Ulbricht the libertarian\u00a0 administrator of the Silk Road that will probably never walk the street\u00a0 again as a free man didn't get a fair trial and was a shining example\u00a0 that the intelligence community as well a judicial system cares more\u00a0 about protecting constitutional right violating practices rather than\u00a0 allowing someone a fair trial. This is not the only example of the a\u00a0 government abusing its power and the majority of people either seem to\u00a0 hear about it accept it, or just not care, and then the moment passes by\u00a0 a flicker in the timeline of government corruption.\u00a0 \nIf you live in\u00a0 America you should absolutely believe in conspiracy, we are all in it\u00a0 together and we are all living in one. If you enjoyed please share, if\u00a0 you didn't I am sorry. If you are ever given the opportunity to expose a\u00a0 valid source or practice please do everyone around you a favor and\u00a0 speak up. These agencies don't care about you or your rights and will\u00a0 often go to illegal and extreme means to further there investigations or\u00a0 agendas, so as citizens you shouldn't care about their right to protect\u00a0 sources and practices (as long as no one gets hurt). Shout it from the rooftops and do your best to starve the beast if you will. Thanks.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Say no to facism"}

Of course, in a free economy, banks would have used whatever method they wanted whenever they wanted, so none would have gone bankrupt because those not already using mark-to-model when the market demand for CDOs (made up of subprime home mortgages) temporarily stopped could have simply switched to mark-to-model whenever sales volume went below a certain threshold like it did in 2008.\n\nEveryone in the world would have considered it reasonable if banks had been allowed to say that they couldn't rely solely on market prices when there was almost no market activity at that moment; whereas, by forcing mark-to-market on the banks, government was forcing them to value their assets (CDOs made up of subprime home mortgages) at only 20% of what the underlying homes were worth, which is obviously nonsense, but which enabled many already very rich insiders to make billions by betting this would happen.\n\nIn a free world, if these investment banks (they were not consumer banks) had somehow gone bankrupt anyway, then more responsible banks could have taken their place (a.k.a \"creative destruction\"). Then the economy would have recovered like it always had before, but instead of letting them choose their asset valuation model, and instead of letting them go bankrupt, banks were forced to take trillions of dollars printed out of thin air, and banks (e.g. the Federal Reserve) then loaned trillions of dollars (printed out of thin air) to the government, so the federal debt is now more than twice as much as it was in 2008, and yet, the millions of quality jobs that we began losing in 2008 never came back, and wages went down, and the percentage of people employed (labor participation rate), which collapsed in 2008, also never came back, which is different than every previous recession\/crash, except for one\u2014the Great Depression.\n\nSo, the economy never actually recovered from the crash of 2008, but the stock market did indeed quadruple because where else was all that money printed out of thin air going to go? That's just inflation. Be glad that the price of food, clothes, cars, etc. hasn't quadrupled\u2014yet.\n\nOf course, in a free economy there would have been no CDO market crash (and hence no stock market crash) for so many reasons. For example, banks would have never given loans to people who couldn't pay them back if they hadn't known that government (e.g. Fannie Mae) would buy those (subprime) loans from them, and of course, the people would not have been utterly clueless about all of this before, during, and since ... if we had any free and independent media bigger than a blog.\n\nThe controlled media say that the 2008 crisis was caused by the repeal of Glass-Steagall (they never admit that was signed by Bill Clinton either), but that was a non issue because Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG did not have any checking or savings accounts.\n\nHow many times have you heard the establishment place any blame on how banks and the media are in bed with government (a.k.a. cronyism)?\n\nI am really just scratching the surface of the role of government, media, and cronyism in causing the crash and perpetrating the cover up, but it should already be clear that the free market and anti-establishment types are the last people we should blame.\n\nFor more details read: [2008 Crash &amp; Cover Up\u2014Both by Government, Glass-Steagall Irrelevant](http:\/\/endofinnocence.com\/2008-crash-cover-up-not-glass-steagall\/).\n\nThis is a copy of [the article I just wrote at EndOfInnocence.com](http:\/\/endofinnocence.com\/economic-crash-2008-glass-steagall-banks-media-trump-cronyism\/).","subreddit":"C_S_T","title":"The establishment will blame their next crash on freedom\u2014just like last time, and they will blame us too this time.""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"[deleted]","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"We're scattered all over; freedom lovers are everywhere."}

Please remember to read the proposed measures carefully and beware of trojan laws. If I'm reading these correctly:  \n\n1)  The \"New Approach Measure\" -  An amendment that requires prescription for use in treating one of ten specified medical conditions, a 4% sales tax and all sales, cultivation and licensing is state-regulated  \n\n2) \"The Bradshaw Amendment\" - An amendment that creates a \"Research institute\" led by a guy I've never heard of called \"Bradshaw\" to \"develop cures and treatments for cancer and other incurable diseases or medical conditions\" and seemingly also determine what diseases would benefit from marijuana treatment. Included is a 15% tax on top of being told what you can use marijuana for.  \n\n3) \"Missourians for Patient Care Act\" - Not an amendment, but a law (which could allow politicians to monkey around with it). Imposes a 2% tax, doesn't express any protections for recreational use, medical use seems to be regulated (similar to prescription pharmaceuticals - 2.5 ounce limit per 14 days) and medical use is only for one of four conditions - cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma and intractable migraines unresponsive to other treatments.  \n\nIn other words, if I'm reading this correctly, they all seem to be total dogshit and an attempt to kickstart an industry pre-filled with regulations, where winners and losers are already cemented in their respective places and doesn't guarantee the use of these plants to anyone unless the government says it's ok. \n\nThe sad part is one measure (which was conveniently left off the ballot) proposed  removing marijuana from the state's list of controlled substances, legalized marijuana for personal and medical use, allowed for the sale of marijuana, and immediately released all prisoners incarcerated for nonviolent marijuana-related crimes. The measure would have also prohibited the state from using state funds to enforce federal marijuana laws that conflict with state marijuana laws. \n\nDon't settle for shitty half measures and don't be tempted to vote for these measures. We can do much better.\n\n Sources:  [https:\/\/www.riverfronttimes.com\/newsblog\/2018\/08\/03\/missouri-has-three-marijuana-initiatives-on-the-2018-ballot-heres-the-breakdown](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/redirect?event=comments&amp;redir_token=gL3HuZ8Ecz-xg-Qn3s-LOAZdlRZ8MTUzOTYyMzE1OEAxNTM5NTM2NzU4&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.riverfronttimes.com%2Fnewsblog%2F2018%2F08%2F03%2Fmissouri-has-three-marijuana-initiatives-on-the-2018-ballot-heres-the-breakdown)  \n\n[https:\/\/www.sos.mo.gov\/cmsimages\/Elections\/Petitions\/2018-051.pdf](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/redirect?event=comments&amp;redir_token=gL3HuZ8Ecz-xg-Qn3s-LOAZdlRZ8MTUzOTYyMzE1OEAxNTM5NTM2NzU4&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sos.mo.gov%2Fcmsimages%2FElections%2FPetitions%2F2018-051.pdf)  \n\n[https:\/\/docs.wixstatic.com\/ugd\/31fb95\\_8cb1506402cc4997b81c8b153448bb3b.pdf](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/redirect?event=comments&amp;redir_token=gL3HuZ8Ecz-xg-Qn3s-LOAZdlRZ8MTUzOTYyMzE1OEAxNTM5NTM2NzU4&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.wixstatic.com%2Fugd%2F31fb95_8cb1506402cc4997b81c8b153448bb3b.pdf) \n\n [https:\/\/www.sos.mo.gov\/cmsimages\/Elections\/Petitions\/2018-271.pdf\ufeff](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/redirect?event=comments&amp;redir_token=gL3HuZ8Ecz-xg-Qn3s-LOAZdlRZ8MTUzOTYyMzE1OEAxNTM5NTM2NzU4&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sos.mo.gov%2Fcmsimages%2FElections%2FPetitions%2F2018-271.pdf) ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Missouri marijuana legalization measures this Nov all seem to be garbage"}

The biggest debate by far (especially on the tv airwaves) has been about the repeal of our costly gas tax. I've listened to both sides and can see where they're both coming from, so I'm looking to see things from a new perspective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn one hand, the infrastructure in SoCal sucks. The freeways are a nightmare to drive on at any time of the day, 6\/7 days of the week. If the money were to be used to ease congestion, or focus on making public transportation a more viable alternative, then I think it might be worth it. I ultimately believe that local government should contract construction jobs like these to private companies, but since I know that that won't happen in my lifetime, I feel like it's CalTrans' responsibility to fix these roads.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, the tax that we pay for something as necessary as gasoline is frustrating. This state already pays more in gas tax than anywhere else in the country, and it's hard to believe that they are using our funds honestly. The freeway near my house has been under construction since summer of '14, with a projected finish date (back then) of September '18. It's not even close to being done. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf California keeps the gas tax, it's going to lead a change towards electric-powered vehicles.

Furthermore I think like the constitution says \"All power to the people\"seriously forbids banning certain people from voting the way or party they want.

That's what we're up against, folks.\n\nI'd **love** to see how the leftists on here - who routinely mock the Alt-Right's concerns over the White Genocide agenda as being a completely deranged and absurd conspiracy theory - react to this interview.\n\nAnd by the way, his estimates are probably way, way too conservative. There's a very consistent trend of demographers grossly underestimating the pace at which the White Genocide agenda is advancing all across the White Western world. For example, his 2050 estimate for the minority status of White Americans is probably off by about [19 years](https:\/\/nationalpolicy.institute\/2018\/08\/17\/2050-is-coming-sooner-than-we-thought\/).

Everyone who has looked at the demographic projections has concluded that it **is** indeed happening.

The public has until the close of Monday to comment on the proposal.\n\n&gt;More than 7,600 comments have been submitted so far, the vast majority in opposition, including many who consider it an effort by the Trump administration to deter some of the major protests that have marked his presidency.\n\nAll of this behavior is extremely concerning to me, especially this from the President's own mouth:\n\n&gt;\"You don't hand matches to an arsonist and you don't give power to an angry left-wing mob - and that's what they've become. The Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern. Republicans believe in the rule of law, not the rule of the mob.\"\n\nAm I the only person who finds all this behavior quite unnerving? If you are willing to suppress the vote to hold onto power, cast the opposition as violent, angry, etc. and want to stifle protests...then I'm not entirely sure what makes us different than the countries that we criticize?\n\nHow does democracy necessarily work when these kind of tactics are being used? I'm being 100% serious. I've always thought that people protested when their leaders are not representing them however this administration seems to hate protests and protesters? Is this normal?\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Can we have a serious talk about what's happening with the Republican Party?"}

Indiana*, which the Supreme Court is deciding soon.  Just a quick summary:\n\n[*Timbs v. Indiana*](http:\/\/www.scotusblog.com\/case-files\/cases\/timbs-v-indiana\/) is a case being argued on November 28, and it could be a big blow to civil forfeiture laws.  Basically in Indiana this guy was caught transporting drugs in his $45,000 Land Rover.  He was sentenced to one year in prison and five years on probation, and fined ~$2,000.  But the state also took his car because it was used to transport the drugs, and he sued under the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nBasically, SCOTUS goes through a \"selective incorporation\" process where they decide individually which clauses out of the Bill of Rights can be used against the states.  So if Illinois decided to ban all Republicans from publishing in newspapers, you could sue them under the First Amendment.  Even though the First Amendment was originally only usable against the federal government, it was incorporated so now you can use it against states.  So the question before the court is whether or not SCOTUS will incorporate the Excessive Fines Clause.\n\nIf SCOTUS chooses to incorporate, it could be a pretty big deal for property rights.  States would likely be subject to a proportionality test, where they can't just take your money\/stuff if its value is \"grossly disproportionate\" to the crime you committed.  Many states have systems where they hire private attorneys on a contingency fee to go after fined individuals to take whatever property they can get their hands on.  If SCOTUS incorporates, things like that would likely get shut down.\n\nWhat's nice to see is that people of many different political persuasions are in favor of Timbs.  All of the *amici curiae* briefs are in favor of incorporation, and these come from both libertarian groups and far left groups (and other groups).","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"There's a big civil forfeiture case going before the Supreme Court this term and it could have big implications for property rights"}

If we start getting the word out now, being that annoying little promoting person that shares images on social media, **we just might have a shot of breaking the cycle this next election.** You don't have to spam your followers, just repost the occasional content in which you agree with. It's also the time to get creative, **we need original propaganda** that really catches people's eyes and heads (makes them think). Remember the first time you ever heard Ron Paul speak? Finally a politician that you can follow each and every word they say, and it made sense, not just filibustering.\n\n**The Libertarian Party got 3% of votes in the 2016**, after accomplishing 0.9% in 2012.\n\nThe Green Party got 1% of votes in the 2016, after accomplishing 0.3% in 2012.\n\nThe Constitution Party got 0.09% in 2012.\n\nIf just one of these parties could **get 5% of votes**, it would qualify them to **equal Federal funding** in 2024. Meaning they would be on just as many commercials, interviews, speech tours and even get into the debates.\n\nAll ships rise in this case, however the Libertarian party is already set to be the next major breakthrough party with the help of Millennials. The internet has provided a neutral platform that cannot be silenced and this movement has become a snowball in colleges around the country. The two party system is the march of tyranny, designed to pit us against each other, making a case of \"them or us\" that doesn't exist but in our minds. It is illegal to have a Monopoly in politics, so they make \"you scratch my back\" behind the scenes deals to make sure they are the only ones running the show. You can try and say \"if we just rearrange the house\/senate, get such and such Dem or Reb in there\" but this is not football, there is no fantasy team.\n\nPeople will have you believe you are wasting your vote, but\n\n**Your vote for Libertarian is the most important vote of all because you are voting for the future, your future.**\n\nIn case you ever wondered, and someone can\/will correct me on this, but if I recall correctly the way Canada's system works is whoever is the runner up in their elections becomes Vice President, then the Speaker of the House of Representatives and so on, like a literal race. If there is ever a time where the cabinet cannot come to a unanimous agreement on  something, then the whole party goes into a re-election process, allowing other people to run against them. I'm not saying this with honey glazed eyes over Canada's political system, just like the idea of politicians needing people more than people think they need politicians.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Revolutions Take Time"}

That seems remarkably efficient, but distorts the facts. First, of the $3.4 trillion collected in 2017, almost 70% was not collected by the IRS. Rather, businesses collected it through wage withholding and employment taxes. Second, the public alone carries the cost of recordkeeping and filing tax returns. The National Taxpayer Advocate estimated that in 2016, taxpayers spent 6 billion hours on these tasks, not even including dealing with IRS notices, audits and enforcement actions. If tax compliance were a business, it would be one of the largest in the U.S. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will increase these costs. The Treasury believes businesses will spend 25 million hours\/year complying with section 199A. That\u2019s more than one-third the time it took GM to manufacture all the vehicles it sold in the U.S. in 2017. At an estimated cost of $46\/hour, businesses will spend $1,150,000,000 complying with this single code section. Treasury also believes businesses will spend 900,000 hours and $49 million complying with the new international tax laws. Is that truly efficient? Isn\u2019t it time for a new tax system?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Is that really efficient?"}

I have decided I'm going to rethink my view of immigration, mostly because as I argued it, it began to come clear to me that I hadn't thought it out enough no formalized it.\n\n[I'm gonna be rethinking and Re-evaluating my stance after what I have learned and made to think about in the comments, so this is gonna all change pretty quick. You may see some stuff from before, until this bracketed paragraph is deleted, assume I just haven't gotten around to it rather then it being my update\/current view.]\n\nSo for those of you who have seen; When it comes to Immigration, I want to balance an individual's right to migrate and move with a nation's right to not have their lands tresspassed on by unwelcome persons. Then that brought up the question of \"Do Nation's have rights\" many people say no, I personally believed that they did through the rights of the individuals that make them up. After some thought and discussion, that started to make less sense and well you probably assume what happened next. \n\nWell I guess enough background, this my new idea:\n\nAn Individual has a right to migrate and move from place to place within their own Territory or Country, that can not be restricted.\n\nI as a American\/Texan have a right to move to different cities and areas within Texas, and the United States. Restricting this is a violation of that right.\n\nIndividuals are free to immigrate to another country, but should not recieve all the benefits which are given to citizens of the country; Until citizenship is acquired, you are a guest. An Immigrated Individual has a right to work and pursue education, and any other right given to a citizen, but until citizenship is acquired they must earn their place in society by adding to it (usually by working a job or pursuing an education so that they might be able to work).\n\nIf I immigrate to the United Kingdom, I should not recieve benefits such as welfare, free\/partly paid healthcare, and government housing; I am free to find a job or go to school to recieve an education, and I recieve equal protection and rights under the law but the nation in which I have immigrated to owes me nothing until I have successfully acquired citizenship.\n\nWhile an Immigrant is protected by the same law, if a violent crime is commited by the individual, they can be subject to be returned back to their home country but only after a fair trial by jury and subjected to due process. Non-violent crimes (if crimes at all) would give the immigrated individual the same punishment as a Citizen of the Country, and only after a fair trial and being subjected to due process.\n\nIf an immigrant from Mexico is in the United States murders a man's daughter, he is still afforded a fair trial before jury and due process. If they can not afford an attorney, they will be provided the same as a citizen. If they are found guilty, they would be removed from the country and returned to their home country. If a Immigrant from Honduras gets a parking ticket, that is not reason for deportation, but they must still take the same steps of settling the issue as a citizen.\n\n\nPlease comment any Criticisms, or any questions to develop the ideas and so I can explain further, or if any of y'all have a better idea than one I put please comment it.\n\nI wanna learn and develop my views and ideas, most comments are helpful.\n\n\nFirst off, Thanks to All Y'all for your comments, criticisms, and general discussion. It has helped me really get to think about my ideas, where in a forum with everyone nodding and smiling would have not.\n\nI at the very least have learned that I should define some terms in the OP to avoid conclusion and the like; as well as rethinking some terminology used I use to avoid similar problems. I have also found areas where I may need to reevaluate my position or think it over some more. So once again thank you.\n\nThe glossary is mostly irrelevant now","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Like some Feed Back on Immigration ideas"}

Again, people can do whatever they want with their money. BUUUUUUT...\n* All of the money is distributed at a percentage. For example, a certain percentage of the total value is given away in the form of lottery winners (obviously), a certain percentage goes to to supplementing the state educational budget (which is why the lottery was originally implemented), and -THIS IS IMPORTANT- a certain PERCENTAGE goes to the state government for RUNNING THE LOTTERY. \n\nNow, tell me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't it seem that the state gov't has a GIANT interest in perpetuating these giant winnings since\u2014even though the state lottery dept. isn't necessarily doing anything extra to earn its money\u2014it gets a percentage rather than a flat budget like most other government entities?\n\nNeedless to say, I didn't put my cash in my office's pool.

Because apparently the state doesn't care who the baby's actual dad is, as long as there's a second party to financially look after the kid.

The children of the world love dinosaurs, and the children are going to delight-just delight-in this place. Their little faces will shine with the joy of finally seeing these wonderful animals. But\n\nI am afraid . . . I may not live to see it, Henry. I may not live to see the joy on their faces.\" \"I think there are other problems, too,\" Wu said, frowning. \"But none so pressing on my mind as this,\" Hammond said, \"that I may not live to see their shining, delighted faces. This is our triumph, this park. We have done what we set out to do. And, you remember, our original intent was to use the newly emerging technology of genetic engineering to make money. A lot of money.\"\n\nWu knew Hammond was about to launch into one of his\n\nold speeches. He held up his hand. \"I'm familiar with this, John-\" \"If you were going to start a bioengineering company, Henry, what would you do? Would you make products to help mankind, to fight illness and disease? Dear me, no. That's a terrible idea.\n\nA very poor use of new technology.\"\n\nHammond shook his head sadly. \"Yet, you'll remember,\" he said, \"the original genetic engineering companies, like Genentech and Cetus, were all started to make pharmaceuticals.\n\nNew drugs for mankind. Noble, noble purpose. Unfortunately, drugs face all kinds of barriers.\n\nFDA testing alone takes five to eight years-if you're lucky. Even worse, there are forces at work in the marketplace. Suppose you make a miracle drug for cancer or heart disease-as Genentech did. Suppose you now want to charge a thousand dollars or two thousand dollars a dose. You might imagine that is your privilege. After all, you invented the drug, you paid to develop and test it; you should be able to charge whatever you wish.\n\n**But do you really think that the government will let you do that? No, Henry, they will not. Sick people aren't going to pay a thousand dollars a dose for needed medication-they won't be grateful, they'll be outraged. Blue Cross isn't going to pay it. They'll scream highway robbery. So something will happen. Your patent application will be denied. Your permits will be delayed. Something will force you to see reason-and to sell your drug at a lower cost. From a business standpoint, that makes helping mankind a very risky business. Personally, I would never help mankind.\"**\n\nWu had heard the argument before. And he knew Hammond was right, some new bioengineered pharmaceuticals had indeed suffered inexplicable delays and patent problems.\n\n\"Now,\" Hammond said, \"think how different it is when you're making entertainment, Nobody needs entertainment. That's not a matter for government intervention. If I charge five thousand dollars a day for my park, who is going to stop me? After all, nobody needs to come here. And, far from being highway robbery, a costly price tag\n\nactually increases the appeal of the park. A visit becomes a status symbol, and all Americans love that. So do the Japanese, and of course they have far more money.\"\n\nHammond finished his ice cream, and Maria silently took the dish away. \"She's not from here,\n\nyou know,\" he said. \"She's Haitian. Her mother is French.

The director of the CDC would be one, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics probably another. Dr.  Andrew Zimmerman, the former director of medical research at the prestigious Kennedy Krieger Institute at Johns Hopkins University, would be the third.\n\nFor years Dr. Zimmerman served as a go-to expert in \u201cvaccine court\u201d to dispute parental claims that vaccines caused their children\u2019s autism.  And as the reigning national expert on the topic of autism in the scientific community, Dr. Zimmerman\u2019s opinions held tremendous weight:  His written testimony helped deny the claims of the families of more than five thousand children with autism during an Omnibus Autism Proceeding in 2009 in vaccine court, as I will explain in a moment.\n\nIn the late 1990s a young doctor fresh out of medical school joined the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore as a resident and worked closely with Dr. Zimmerman. His name was Jon Poling. In 2000 Dr. Poling\u2019s nineteen-month-old daughter, Hannah, experienced a massive  regression into autism after her [**vaccinations**](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/anti-therapeutic-action\/vaccination-all),  much as happened to my son. Unlike my son, Hannah\u2019s parents had access to the most sophisticated autism research center in the world, and Dr.  Zimmerman and several of his colleagues, including Dr. Richard Kelley,  who was serving as director of Kennedy Krieger\u2019s laboratory, tried to figure out what had happened to her, and why.\n\n \n\n# Dr. Zimmerman on Children He Sees at Harvard \n\n**Lawyer:  You actually see children in your clinic daily, weekly, with autism  that has resulted from an underlying mitochondrial disorder?** \n\n*Dr. Zimmerman: Yes.* \n\n**Lawyer:  And when you see those children, you go about trying to figure out what  may have been the triggering event or the causative event of the  regressive autism?**\n\n*Dr. Zimmerman: Yes.*\n\n**Lawyer:  And in your practice you look at vaccines as one potential cause for a  regressive autism in a child\u2014for children like Yates?** \n\n*Dr. Zimmerman: Potential, yes. And then we\u2014we\u2019re trying very hard to treat them.* \n\nDr.  Zimmerman confirms that vaccines are on the table as a possible cause  of autism for all the children whom he sees. I also want to point out  that in reading Dr. Zimmerman\u2019s entire deposition, I really saw his  humanity, and his honesty. He sees these children every day. Unlike  NeuroTribes\u2019 Steven Silberman, Dr. Zimmerman isn\u2019t romanticizing autism;  he knows how devastating a disability it is, for the affected kids and  their families.

Throwing money at a problem doesn't make it disappear. \n\nIt seems to be the problem is colleges. If people are paying extravagant amounts for education, then don't make enough money with their degree, then the way I see it, 1 of 4 things is happening.\n\n1) the education provided is not enough to land a job or a high paying one in the field, making the degree useless.\n\n2) the education is good, but costs so much that you don't make up for it in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n3) the education and costs are fine, but people don't make the right decisions after getting their degree.\n\n4) the education you receive is crap, **and** it costs a lot of money, meaning college is a scam.\n\nWith any of these scenarios I see 2 parties responsible. The college goer (the consumer) and the college (the service\/product provider). Neither of these involve the government or other people. If you bought a car that doesn't work, are you just going to get everyone else to pay to fix it, or do you want the dealership that sold it to you to fix it? In this case, if you raised the money elsewhere and paid for the repairs, the dealership is going to continue to sell people broken cars, because they have no obligation or responsibility to fix them if people are buying them anyway. If instead you protested\/boycotted that dealership and no one bought their cars from them, they'd be forced to either lower prices or fix the cars (or both) or they'd go out of business. They don't want to go out of business, so they will do something.\n\nI just don't understand the mindset \"college is too expensive, I'm still paying it off 10 years later\" and you blame EVERYONE ELSE except the two parties involved. The student and the school. The shool sets the prices, the students pay it, why is that anyone else's problem?\n\nFor those lawsuit happy people, think of it this way, someone scammed you out of money, you know who they are, do you sue them? or do you sue the government and your neighbors because THEY should reimburse you for your loss, not the person who scammed you? You are not holding the a cammer accountable, they will continue to scam, it gets us nowhere. \n\nWe all want the price of college to decrease, but we need a better way to do it. Demanding everyone pay for it will not only just increase the school's profits and do nothing for costs, it's not fair to everyone else who doesn't go. Should you be paying my car payment even though you'll never drive my car? You don't even have a car at all, but you should pay my car payment because I made the choice to buy a car that I can't afford. It's not my problem though, it's yours. College is an investment. If you paid $75k for some stocks in a company and then the company went down the drain, or the stock price did so your shares are worthless, you're going to hold that company responsible. You don't say that everyone else should pay you back for the money you lost. You chose to invest, and the company didn't do well. That's between you and the company. You made a bad investment.\n\nDon't you see, the colleges are on your side? Of course they want more people paying for college, because they want those profits. Then want government subsidized student loans because that guarantees them payment. \n\n**I know there are a lot of Democrats, Socialists, and Communists on this sub. I didn't call anyone lib-tards or anything like that. I'm asking for a serious response and if you can't give a calm, mature response then please go echo chamber somewhere else.

As a former independent voter, I wanted to find a worthy cause in which to put my time. Over the course of that research, I discovered Libertarianism. The tenets of it appealed to me, and it could be broken down into \"Don't hurt other people and don't take their stuff\". \n\nFast-forward a year. \n\nI've lurked on this sub for some time, and I've posted both questions and opinions while looking for support from the community. All I ever received from people in this part were derisive remarks, hate speech, and dismissive statements with no support whatsoever. \n\nSo, I lurked some more. Every day, reading and reading what you all post here. I've never seen so many people call each other \"faggots\" and \"statists\" (your community's four-letter word). The amount of hate speech is unbecoming of any political party. Those who use it should be ashamed...but they're not.\n\nSo, I ask you this: How do you, the Libertarian party, think you can win the hearts and minds of non-Libertarians with that kind of discourse? How does your hate speech differ from the same rhetoric of any other political party or fundamental religion?\n\nI'm fully aware that this comment will result in more hate speech directed toward me, one-word responses such as \"faggot\" or \"statist\", and a collection of down-votes. I don't care; it just proves everything I've written down here. \n\nIf this sub is a good cross-section of the USA's Libertarian party, I see no difference between you and \/r\/The_Donald \n\nI used to go to church because I wanted to live the ideals that were preached. Then I realized that people don't want to do that. They just go to feel better about themselves and bash the other non-believers or those who dissent from their core tenets...doing exactly the opposite of what they should be doing. Your party has been no different toward me. So, like church, I will leave the community and go my own way. At least I can welcome myself.\n\nYour party is a mess. It's all over the place with no cohesive ideas. What is represented by the Libertarian official website is not reflected in the general consensus of Libertarians as a whole.\n\nSo, goodbye.

First, the article definitely has a more liberal viewpoint (liberal in this case being more aligned with the general Democrat party viewpoint) as can be seen from some of how things are described.  But, it's still an interesting viewpoint because it's from a very close neighbor country, and I think it does raise some interesting points.  \n\n\nSo, first up, how likely do the people here feel a new US civil war is?  From where I sit, I'm not so sure there's going to be one anytime soon.  Yes, you've got the loudmouths on both sides of the political spectrum screaming for all they're worth and getting on the news, but I think by-and-large **most** Americans are much more tolerant of opposing views than it seems.  Sure, shortly after the 2016 elections you heard the stories about people no longer associating with people because of who they voted for, but really, how many probably did that?  \n\n\nMy personal feelings, though?  I don't think there's going to be an actual \"war\" as such.  I think more likely the current Republican and Democrat parties are going to either fracture into a lot of smaller parties, or they're going to find people voting for the more middle-of-the-road candidates in primaries, pulling both of them back towards the center.  \n\n\nAnd, you ask, what does this have to do with Libertarianism?  Well, in such a case one would expect the possibility of a 3rd party candidate to gain some traction, especially one which I think, again, the majority of voters could agree with more of the platform of said party.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Thoughts on this article about \"America's Next Civil War\""}

One issue that I always sided with Conservatives on was how many genders there were.  I was on board with the idea that there were two genders, with the odd mutation of people born with two genitalia and the person got to choose.\n\nThen I noticed how Conservatives were really pushing the scientific side of the argument.  And I was a little confused.  Conservatives seemed to often oppose scientific theories, so why are they suddenly ringing the science bell to prove their point?\n\nThen I tried some thought experiments.  This subreddit does seem to have a majority of Liberals and Conservatives who are constantly trying to claim Libertarians as \"my side\", but there are some make legitimate arguments and really get me thinking.  Some of you really have a clear idea of what Libertarianism is and I look for you people.  Sometimes your comments get buried but I see you.  Sure I've taken 3 or 4 political science courses in University but none seemed to cover modern day issues but some of the Libertarians here helped me grasp what Liberty and Freedom means.\n\nDoes the gender issue get on my nerves?  Fuck yes, these kids who scream that there are 30-40 genders irk me so much.  But that's part of living in a free country.  True freedom means I'm going to constantly encounter people I disagree with and people who get on my nerves.  But I have no right to change who they are or try and manipulate laws to make people believe either way.  There are some issues that need to be sorted by the people and the government and courts really should have no say.  It feels like I've matured a little. At 44.\n\nSo, these multiple gender people as much as they bother me, they really aren't infringing on my liberties whatsoever.  So, if you want to be a god damn tree, be a god damn tree.  That's freedom.  But don't expect me to call you an Oak or water you.  That's for your other multiple gender friends to do.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I am a Liberal who was a two gender proponent.

Because you can't create more land, (don't think of land as literally dry land, but rather as 3D space with natural resources in it), therefore taxing it won't discourage production. \n\nPros:\n\n* Economically efficient\n\n* Impossible to evade (you can't hide land)\n\n* Will reduce land speculation (unimproved land is taxed just as much as improved land)\n\n* Allows for drastic cuts in other taxes\n\n\nCons:\n\n* Have to value land in a fair way\n\nPossible solution: let land-owners self-assess, but force them to sell at their given price (or some other variation driven by market principles).\n\n* Discourages making discoveries that increase the tax burden (for example oil on your property if you are not in the oil business)\n\nPossible solution: Count new discoveries as human improvements and don't tax them.\n\n* Lots of people are invested in property\n\nPossible solution: Frankly, I think this is the biggest obstacle for its implementation.  All changes in the tax code will have winners and losers to some degree, but if we delay the change, it will only hurt more when it inevitably occurs. We should try to implement it gradually.\n\nIn my opinion the pros outweigh the cons, and a LVT is far better, in regards to liberty, than consumption taxes like the Fairtax.\n\nShouldn't libertarians embrace the LVT as a replacement of other taxes and use it as a step towards smaller government?

{"author":"wndrkd","created_utc":1540540562,"num_comments":123,"score":21,"selftext":"First of all let me start by saying that I'm not American -- I'm Asian. I find my beliefs to be on the spectrum of Libertarianism.\n\nI'm just surprised how many ignore the fact that causing \"excessive\" pollution is ignored as a violation of NAP. One may argue that breathing contributes to pollution, but that's why I included \"excessive\" because there is a point wherein the carbon dioxide cycle nets too much CO2 for it to be non-harmful. \n\nI am a researcher and have worked on CO2 conversion technologies to address the excess net let me tell you, we are very very far from developing economically viable means (and scale) to do this if the trend of CO2 production continues. (The technology probably needs more more than 3 decades of RnD to reach commercial application)\n\nNow, I believe I can't argue with climate change hoax deniers\/conspirators if they don't believe or understand the evidence. I can't blame them because not a lot of people have backgrounds in Science and can easily be swayed by some youtube video or some deliberate misinterpretation of data. And also, maybe that the timeframe for the damage to individuals and property is hard to grasp.\n\nBut to simplify the scale and timeframe, let's consider a river that runs through 2 properties. I live own on the property upstream, and (let's call this guy John), John lives downstream. I own a piggery and throw the shit of my pigs on the river. John fishes on the river. Isn't the throwing of shit on the river an agression (whether intended or not) towards John and his property? Can I just tell John he can eat the fish with shit because I don't believe the other people telling me that shit on fish is bad? Aren't I violating the NAP towards John? And if I refuse to address the damage I am inflicting towards John and his property, wouldn't John be in his right to take up his arms against me? If I was in John's place, I think I would.\n\nI just thought this wouldn't be much of an issue amongst Libertarians but I am surprises that it is. Of course, for the people who don't believe or understand the Science behind it, it's another issue. I believe that is the failure of us Researchers (or those before us) that we\/they were not able to communicate properly the implications of certain chemicals on the environment. (Of course there are certain areas where there are disputes amongst researchers but there are those that there is an overwhelming consensus already and some little details are simply being misrepresented and misunderstood by those who lack a deeper background in the area)\n\nThis, I believe is a key issue on why the general population don't take Libertarians seriously. It's disappointing to see the term \"wild-eyed libertarians\" thrown around on the mainstream just because certain individuals are not able to grasp some scientific concepts properly and is suddenly representative of how Libertarians think.\n\nWe're not \"NPCs\". We don't need to parrot whatever mainstream belief of a group where we are lumped to. We just need to verify the facts and Science behind it as individuals. And if it's not our field of expertise or difficult to understand, let's not speak with certainty and take whatever is shoved to us critically. As our friends from the crypto community says, \"Don't trust. Verify.\"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Surprising stance of many Libertarians on pollution and climate change"}

I really don't feel one way or another about as far as \"should it be allowed\" goes. \n\nPro-choice proponents claim that it is the *woman's* body, therefor the woman is allowed to make the choice. Then after the little fella pops out it is the *man's* responsibility to take care of. What I mean is they say the woman can make the sole decision to abort or not, regardless of how the father feels about. He has no say because it's \"not his body\". Once the baby is born, the *woman* can then keep the baby away from the father with pretty much no real reason, even if the man wants to father the child, and then demand child support payments for the baby. Again, the man has no say.\n\nIt makes no sense that the woman can decide to abort a fetus because she doesn't want it, but then at the same time can force a man to pay for it whether or not he does want the baby. I think women should be held to the same standard. If women can make the sole decision to abort, then they should not be able to sue for child support. It's just not fair.\n\nIt seems really immature for women to want to abort on the basis of what happens to their *body*, not because of the situation the baby would be put in. By saying \"it's my body\" you are blatantly saying that you don't care about the baby, you care about being sick, getting bigger, etc that comes along with being pregnant. That's a reason to abort a baby? That's insane to me. That's ok? I can see having an abortion for rape, financial reasons, health reasons (mother is at a high risk, has a life threatening disease, etc), but because you don't want to carry it inside you?\n\nIt's just a huge double standard. Either the man has has rights and responsibility to father his child, or he doesn't. You can't just give and take those responsibilities when it's convenient for you.\n\nI think it's complete shit how few rights fathers have with their child. A man can be hit with child support for a child he didn't know he had, years after it's born, and in certain states (California) he can be hit with child support for a kid that isn't even his, with no DNA test. WTF. There are so many abusive mothers that use their child as an income token, and give the child a potentially worse life by depriving them of their father, all for a paycheck. I think this is the problem.\n\nMy opinion: both parents should have equal responsibility. The fact that the woman carried the baby in her belly is NEGLIGIBLE, and makes no difference. They ride on that excuse knowing there is no way to change it, but if men could get pregnant you'd see how quickly all of this would change. I would have given anything to trade with my wife and be the one that's pregnant. Luckily I don't have the threat of her leaving or taking my daughter, but my wife and I are happy. I'm legitimately scared that if some time in the future she stopped loving me, or just had some sort of mental breakdown and flipped, she could leave with my daughter and on top of that I would have to pay her. Now, there's no reason to suspect any of that is going to happen, but it has happened to so many fucking men it's sickening.\n\nI think the bigger moral issue is not the abortion itself, it's using your baby (or potential baby) as a bargaining chip. Shit needs to stop. Women want their civil liberties, but then want to deprive men of the *biggest* and most important thing they can ever experience. It's more than \"not right\", it's fucking despicable.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The bigger issue about abortion: the double standard."}

Because you can't create more land, (don't think of land as literally dry land, but rather as 3D space with natural resources in it), therefore taxing it won't discourage production. \n\nPros:\n\n* Economically efficient\n\n* Impossible to evade (you can't hide land)\n\n* Will reduce land speculation (unimproved land is taxed just as much as improved land)\n\n* Allows for drastic cuts in other taxes\n\n\nCons:\n\n* Have to value land in a fair way\n\nPossible solution: let land-owners self-assess, but force them to sell at their given price (or some other variation driven by market principles).\n\n* Discourages making discoveries that increase the tax burden (for example oil on your property if you are not in the oil business)\n\nPossible solution: Count new discoveries as human improvements and don't tax them.\n\n* Lots of people are invested in property\n\nPossible solution: Frankly, I think this is the biggest obstacle for its implementation.  All changes in the tax code will have winners and losers to some degree, but if we delay the change, it will only hurt more when it inevitably occurs. We should try to implement it gradually.\n\nIn my opinion the pros outweigh the cons, and a LVT is far better, in regards to liberty, than consumption taxes like the Fairtax.\n\nShouldn't libertarians embrace the LVT as a replacement of other taxes and use it as a step towards smaller government?

Though the main issue is their location, the inner city, and how that creates a culture of learned helplessness. I was wondering if libertarians had a solution for this problem. I have my own ideas with how to solve it but it isn't exactly small government. I think the real way to help these people is to help them leave these low income, expensive communities and get opportunities in median income, low expense areas. Though that would take money. I would think it would be a much better solution than just handing out checks though. This is the teach a man to fish solution. I was wondering if there would be a different, more libertarian approach to this issue. Any thoughts and criticisms?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Low Income Assistance"}

I didn't want to use them, but they are the only one that is basically all over America. This matters because my in-laws will be moving to Florida and they want to deposit cash into her account for her. My wife opened the account in CO where we live with her name as the sponsor or whatever it's called. When she opened it she asked specifically if her mother could deposit into it at any location, that was the whole point of the account, and they said yes. She deposited an opening balance.\n\nFast forward to now, a few weeks later, and her mother went to deposit six hundred dollars cash into the account and was denied. She is still in Colorado for another day but she'll be moving to Florida tomorrow. When she was denied they told her there was a limit of $500 per day for cash, or unlimited for checks. When asked why, they didn't really give an answer. Later that day she was in another store that had a bank inside, she was still curious so she asked one of those bankers about it. They told her it's to \"prevent money laundering\" because of the new marijuana businesses, basically aimed at preventing weed stores from depositing money through third parties, and it was passed a few months ago. (I know marijuana is not federally legal so they can not legally use banks due to federal law.)\n\nIs any of this true? It doesn't seem to make any sense to me. The government has no right to see anyone's finances or track their funds unless they are under investigation of a crime. Can they require your money be traceable for their convenience? This is basically the beginning of outlawing cash. It also seems to have major flaws because this is the first time I'm hearing of it and I deposit cash into my own and my wife's accounts (not Wells Fargo) all the time without ever being IDed. I just deposited over $2,000 at an ATM using my debit card, today.\n\nCan anyone tell me if this is true, or partially true, and either clarify or point me to a source that I can read for myself? There has to be missing pieces to this, because it doesn't add up. If this is true then it is essentially an outright ban on cash. I've also been informed that in lieu of cash limits, some banks will instead require ID and record it in their system when accepting cash deposits from non-account holders. \n\nWe need to stop this. Vote no on any such laws if they come up in the future, and in the mean time, switch to a bank that values privacy and liberty. If none exist then it may be time to find alternatives.

So obviously, the US government does not own the internet, which probably means we don't retain all Constitutional rights on the internet (correct me if I'm wrong)? and large corporations basically run the ins and out of the internet. I have a few questions.\n\n1. should hate speech be censored on the internet? If no, should it be censored on large social media platforms (e.g. Twitter, Facebook)?\n\n2. Should these companies be allowed to censor content? Hate speech vs. political beliefs, where is the line drawn?\n\nMy personal belief is that the internet should be open to any and *all* content. I also believe that the corporations should be able to decide what they want on their platform. But the internet is so intertwined and reliant on social media platforms that the overlap is evident. In cases like Alex Jones', he was censored simultaneously by any and all relevant social media platforms because of what he's said (which was not hate speech and rather his beliefs, no matter how unrealistic). \n \nMy final question pertains to the structure of the internet itself. \n\nShould there be a greater divide between the large corporations who run social media and the internet itself?\n\nIt's understandable why large platforms want to censor content, as they don't want to be affiliated with the shit show that is racism and violence. Reddit does a pretty good job and promoting all content since every subreddit is community-ran and driven. But even Reddit has their lines where they'll ban content as they have to Nazi pages in the past.\n\nI feel as if a community that is not ran by corporation and rather by community has the potential to flourish and share all beliefs from every spectrum. But I also believe it has the potential to run itself into the ground with downright hateful content. Big dilemma. \n\nThoughts?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Thoughts about free speech on the Internet?"}

Harvard biologist George Wald estimated in 1970 that **\u201ccivilization will end within 15 or 30 years unless immediate action is taken against problems facing mankind.\u201d**\n2. **\u201cWe    are in an environmental crisis which threatens the survival of this    nation, and of the world as a suitable place of human habitation,\u201d** wrote Washington University biologist Barry Commoner in the Earth Day issue of the scholarly journal Environment.\n3. The    day after the first Earth Day, the New York Times editorial page    warned, \u201cMan must stop pollution and conserve his resources, not merely    to enhance existence but to save the race from intolerable   deterioration  and possible extinction.\u201d\n4. \u201cPopulation    will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in    food supplies we make,\u201d Paul Ehrlich confidently declared in the April    1970 issue of Mademoiselle. \u201cThe death rate will increase until at  least   100-200 million people per year will be starving to death during  the   next ten years.\u201d\n5. **\u201cMost of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man have already been born,\u201d**    wrote Paul Ehrlich in a 1969 essay titled \u201cEco-Catastrophe!  \u201cBy\u2026\\[1975\\]   some experts feel that food shortages will have escalated  the present   level of world hunger and starvation into famines of  unbelievable   proportions. Other experts, more optimistic, think the  ultimate   food-population collision will not occur until the decade of  the 1980s.\u201d\n6. Ehrlich    sketched out his most alarmist scenario for the 1970 Earth Day issue   of  The Progressive, assuring readers that between 1980 and 1989, some 4    billion people, including 65 million Americans, would perish in the    \u201cGreat Die-Off.\u201d\n7. **\u201cIt is already too late to avoid mass starvation,\u201d** declared Denis Hayes, the chief organizer for Earth Day, in the Spring 1970 issue of The Living Wilderness.\n8. Peter    Gunter, a North Texas State University professor, wrote in 1970,    \u201cDemographers agree almost unanimously on the following grim timetable: **by    1975 widespread famines will begin in India; these will spread by  1990   to include all of India, Pakistan, China and the Near East,  Africa. By   the year 2000, or conceivably sooner, South and Central  America will   exist under famine conditions\u2026.By the year 2000, thirty  years from now,   the entire world, with the exception of Western  Europe, North America,   and Australia, will be in famine.\u201d**\n9. In    January 1970, Life reported, \u201cScientists have solid experimental and    theoretical evidence to support\u2026the following predictions: In a  decade,   urban dwellers will have to wear gas masks to survive air  pollution\u2026**by 1985 air pollution will have reduced the amount of sunlight reaching earth by one half\u2026.\u201d**\n10. Ecologist Kenneth Watt told Time that, \u201cAt the present rate of nitrogen buildup, **it\u2019s only a matter of time before light will be filtered out of the atmosphere and none of our land will be usable.\u201d**\n11. Barry    Commoner predicted that decaying organic pollutants would use up all   of  the oxygen in America\u2019s rivers, causing freshwater fish to   suffocate.\n12. Paul Ehrlich chimed in, predicting **in 1970 that \u201cair pollution\u2026is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next few years alone.\u201d** Ehrlich sketched a scenario in which 200,000 Americans would die in 1973 during \u201csmog disasters\u201d in New York and Los Angeles.\n13. Paul    Ehrlich warned in the May 1970 issue of Audubon that DDT and other    chlorinated hydrocarbons \u201cmay have substantially reduced the life    expectancy of people born since 1945.\u201d Ehrlich warned that **Americans born since 1946\u2026now had a life expectancy of only 49 years,**    and he predicted that if current patterns continued this expectancy    would reach 42 years by 1980, when it might level out. (Note: According    to the most recent CDC report, life expectancy in the US is 78.8   years).\n14. Ecologist Kenneth Watt declared, **\u201cBy    the year 2000, if present trends continue, we will be using up crude    oil at such a rate\u2026that there won\u2019t be any more crude oil.** You\u2019ll drive up to the pump and say, Fill \u2018er up, buddy,\u2019 and he\u2019ll say,  \nI am very sorry, there isn\u2019t any.\u2019\u201d\n15. Harrison    Brown, a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a    chart in Scientific American that looked at metal reserves and **estimated    the humanity would totally run out of copper shortly after 2000.  Lead,   zinc, tin, gold, and silver would be gone before 1990.**\n16. Sen. Gaylord Nelson wrote in Look that, \u201cDr. S. Dillon Ripley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institute, believes that **in 25 years, somewhere between 75 and 80 percent of all the species of living animals will be extinct.\u201d**\n17. **In    1975, Paul Ehrlich predicted that \u201csince more than nine-tenths of the    original tropical rainforests will be removed in most areas within  the   next 30 years or so,** it is expected that half of the organisms in these areas will vanish with it.\u201d\n18. Kenneth    Watt warned about a pending Ice Age in a speech. \u201cThe world has been    chilling sharply for about twenty years,\u201d he declared. **\u201cIf    present trends continue, the world will be about four degrees colder    for the global mean temperature in 1990, but eleven degrees colder in    the year 2000. This is about twice what it would take to put us into  an   ice age.\u201d**\n\nOriginal Article [Here](https:\/\/www.aei.org\/publication\/18-spectacularly-wrong-predictions-made-around-the-time-of-first-earth-day-in-1970-expect-more-this-year-2\/)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"18 examples of the spectacularly wrong predictions made around the first \"Earth Day\" in 1970, that have cost society BILLIONS.

I mean you guys said the government does a shitty job on welfare, no one is entitled to another mans labour, which is true, but I think there are many many cases, charity might not solve it, and lets face it, those who have been around in this world have seen that most people are... shitty.

Throwaway for obvious reasons given some of my more socialist\/ancom friends would throw a hissy fit if they saw this in my history.\n\nFor some background I'm a transgender woman. I kind of described myself as a fiscal centrist up until now, but have honestly been more attracted to free market economics since starting college (not the reverse, crazy I know). But me being trans also kind of pushes me into the left a lot because it's usually obvious republicans, in general, don't have my best interests at heart from a social aspect. I feel lost politically, like there's not really a party that really captures my beliefs. A friend told me I should try looking into the libertarian party, since they're generally \"socially liberal, fiscally conservative (a broad oversimplification, so he says).\" I have and while I'm liking a lot of what I've been reading, I still have some questions I couldn't really find a ton of clear answers to since they're somewhat obscure. It especially kind of relates to being trans tbh, and I really kind of not want to get yelled at or any unnecessary insults I guess, please. I'm not really here to get into any fights or arguments about trans people, or call anyone bigots or any of that \"stereotypical things libtards say\" just to clarify some things.\n\n1. How do libertarians feel about trans people in general? The official stance seems to be \"none of the government's business\" which is cool, but as a general atmosphere, how do you think they're seen or treated by people themselves? Obviously no two people are the same so just kind of in general. Do you know any trans libertarians?\n\n2. Is there a role for a small government to still promote diversity and tolerance, if not lawfully force it? Why or why not? If so, what are examples of how this might be shaped?\n\n3. Does less regulation of private business mean that we'd see a resurgence of conversion therapy and the like for lgbt children and teens? Should parents still be able to force their children to undergo this even though many see it as being traumatizing and abusive. It's pretty clear that personal choice in clientele means you can't sue the pants off someone for not baking you a cake, which is fine with me (why would I frequent businesses that don't like me anyway?) but if a child cannot choose to not go because their parents have power over them, that feels like a totally different issue altogether.\n\n4. The infamous bathroom bill debate. Obviously a non-invasive government shouldn't be demanding ID or a genital check at the door in theory, but does that mean they'd honestly leave it be or could they chalk it up to preventing assault\/rape and finding an excuse to enforce bathroom laws anyway? Would that be a popular opinion?\n\n5. Legal identity. How important would a birth certificate generally be? Would it be easier to get things like name and gender marker legally changed given a \"not our business\" stance, or would it be harder given the government might not really care enough to even make it an accessible option?\n\nThanks for reading and I hope to hear your feedback!","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Just some questions about ideology."}

{"author":"Jasko1111","created_utc":1540815221,"num_comments":2,"score":0,"selftext":"The government believes that the price of a definite commodity, e.g., milk, is too high. It wants to make it possible for the poor to give their children more milk. Thus it resorts to a price ceiling and fixes the price of milk at a lower rate than that prevailing on the free market. The result is that the marginal producers of milk, those producing at the highest cost, now incur losses. As no individual farmer or businessman can go on producing at a loss, these marginal producers stop producing and selling milk on the market. They will use their cows and their skill for other more profitable purposes. They will, for example, produce butter, cheese or meat. There will be less milk available for the consumers, not more. This, or course, is contrary to the intentions of the government. It wanted to make it easier for some people to buy more milk. But, as an outcome of its interference, the supply available drops. The measure proves abortive from the very point of view of the government and the groups it was eager to favor. It brings about a state of affairs, which\u2014again from the point of view of the government\u2014is even less desirable than the previous state of affairs which it was designed to improve.\n\nNow, the government is faced with an alternative. It can abrogate its decree and refrain from any further endeavors to control the price of milk. But if it insists upon its intention to keep the price of milk below the rate the unhampered market would have determined and wants nonetheless to avoid a drop in the supply of milk, it must try to eliminate the causes that render the marginal producers\u2019 business unremunerative. It must add to the first decree concerning only the price of milk a second decree fixing the prices of the factors of production necessary for the production of milk at such a low rate that the marginal producers of milk will no longer suffer losses and will therefore abstain from restricting output. But then the same story repeats itself on a remoter plane. The supply of the factors of production required for the production of milk drops, and again the government is back where it started. If it does not want to admit defeat and to abstain from any meddling with prices, it must push further and fix the prices of those factors of production which are needed for the production of the factors necessary for the production of milk. Thus the government is forced to go further and further, fixing step by step the prices of all consumers\u2019 goods and of all factors of production\u2014both human, i.e., labor, and material\u2014and to order every entrepreneur and every worker to continue work at these prices and wages. No branch of industry can be omitted from this all-around fixing of prices and wages and from this obligation to produce those quantities which the government wants to see produced. If some branches were to be left free out of regard for the fact that they produce only goods qualified as non-vital or even as luxuries, capital and labor would tend to flow into them and the result would be a drop in the supply of those goods, the prices of which government has fixed precisely because it considers them as indispensable for the satisfaction of the needs of the masses.\n\nBut when this state of all-around control of business is attained, there can no longer be any question of a market economy. No longer do the citizens by their buying and abstention from buying determine what should be produced and how. The power to decide these matters has devolved upon the government. This is no longer capitalism; it is all-around planning by the government, it is socialism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is, of course, true that this type of socialism preserves some of the labels and the outward appearance of capitalism. It maintains, seemingly and nominally, private ownership of the means of production, prices, wages, interest rates and profits. In fact, however, nothing counts but the government\u2019s unrestricted autocracy. The government tells the entrepreneurs and capitalists what to produce and in what quantity and quality, at what prices to buy and from whom, at what prices to sell and to whom. It decrees at what wages and where the workers must work. Market exchange is but a sham. All the prices, wages, and interest rates are determined by the authority. They are prices, wages, and interest rates in appearance only; in fact they are merely quantity relations in the government\u2019s orders. The government, not the consumers, directs production. The government determines, directs production. The government determines each citizen\u2019s income, it assigns to everybody the position in which he has to work. This is socialism in the outward guise of capitalism. It is the *Zwangswirtschaft* of Hitler\u2019s German Reich...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How Price Control Leads to Socialism"}

This foreign manufacturer of light has such an advantage over us that he floods our domestic markets with his product. And he offers it at a fantastically low price. The moment this foreigner appears in our country, all our customers desert us and turn to him. As a result, an entire domestic industry is rendered completely stagnant. And even more, since the lighting industry has countless ramifications with other native industries, they, too, are injured. This foreign manufacturer who competes against us without mercy is none other than the sun itself!\n\nHere is our petition: Please pass a law ordering the closing of all windows, skylights, shutters, curtains, and blinds\u2014that is, all openings, holes, and cracks through which the light of the sun is able to enter houses. This free sunlight is hurting the business of us deserving manufacturers of candles. Since we have always served our country well, gratitude demands that our country ought not to abandon us now to this unequal competition.\n\nWe hope that you gentlemen will not regard our petition as mere satire, or refuse it without at least hearing our reasons in support of it.\n\nFirst, if you make it as difficult as possible for the people to have access to natural light, and thus create an increased demand for artificial light, will not all domestic manufacturers be stimulated thereby?\n\nFor example, if more tallow is consumed, naturally there must be more cattle and sheep. As a result, there will also be more meat, wool, and hides. There will even be more manure, which is the basis of agriculture.\n\nNext, if more oil is consumed for lighting, we shall have extensive olive groves and rape fields.\n\nAlso, our wastelands will be covered with pines and other resinous trees and plants. As a result of this, there will be numerous swarms of bees to increase the production of honey. In fact, all branches of agriculture will show an increased development.\n\nThe same applies to the shipping industry. The increased demand for whale oil will then require thousands of ships for whale fishing. In a short time, this will result in a navy capable of upholding the honor of our country and gratifying the patriotic sentiments of the candlemakers and other persons in related industries.\n\nThe manufacturers of lighting fixtures\u2014candlesticks, lamps, candelabra, chandeliers, crystals, bronzes, and so on\u2014will be especially stimulated. The resulting warehouses and display rooms will make our present-day shops look poor indeed.\n\nThe resin collectors on the heights along the seacoast, as well as the coal miners in the depths of the earth, will rejoice at their higher wages and increased prosperity. In fact, gentlemen, the condition of every citizen of our country\u2014from the wealthiest owner of coal mines to the poorest seller of matches\u2014will be improved by the success of our petition.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"A Petition"}

Dictatorship\n2. Lack of constitutional limitations\n3. Nationalism\n4. Militarism\n5. Identity politics. The law defines special privileges or lack of rights for certain races.\n6. High regulation. Companies are regulated by the state so they serve the state\u2019s interests.\n7. High taxation\n8. High government spending\n9. Social engineering and low personal freedom. The state attempts to create utopia by regulating personal behavior. \n10. Eugenics. The state uses killing, sterilization, abortion, or other methods to reduce the population of unwanted groups.\n\nSo does the US have these characteristics?\n\n1. No\n2. Somewhat, but the lack of constitutional limitations is due to rulings by Leftist judges who ascribe to a \u201cliving Constitution\u201d.\n3. Yes, although it has since WWII or longer.\n4. Somewhat, although it has since WII or longer.\n5. Slightly. Companies and universities make special efforts to hire more women and certain minorities, but the government has few laws that disadvantage a specific race or gender. It was far worse before 1970.\n6. Somewhat, but better than most countries.\n7. Somewhat, but better than most countries.\n8. Somewhat, but better than most countries.\n9. Somewhat, but better than most countries. The best freedom of speech protections in the world.\n10. Slightly. Half of black children are aborted, but that\u2019s a free choice.\n\nSo while the US does somewhat exhibit many aspects of fascism, it is farther from fascism than the vast majority of countries on Earth, including the social democracies of Europe, with their centralized, powerful, social engineering, high regulation states and the undemocratic EU. In the last two years, the US has moved farther from fascism on constitutional limitations, identity politics, regulation, taxation, and social engineering.

And not only what they are doing now, but what they have been in the process of doing for the past 15 years. The EULAs, the Terms of Service, and the selling of software of a service, and the SJW convergence have all collectively routed around the rule of law which is necessary for sustained economic growth over time.\n\n\n&gt;In countries with strong rule of law:\n\n&gt;1. Property rights over land, equipment, and personal items are clear and protected by law.\n3. Contracts between people, businesses, and the government are effectively enforced by the legal system.\n3. Political accountability is high and corruption is low.\n4. Business regulations are clear and enforced in a transparent manner.\n\n&gt;In such environments people make long-term investments and build large organizations. In contrast, if the property rights and contracts are not enforced and the business regulations are not clear, most of the economy consists of small family owned firms with little modern equipment. A high-tech, prosperous economy would not develop.\n\nEffectively, there are no contracts anymore in the digital economy. There is no predictability anymore. There is no accountability. There is no responsibility. There are no requirements for performance anymore. In sum, the US digital economy is rapidly becoming the equivalent of a third-world economy, complete with crony capitalism and digital robber barons.\n\nAnd this is just one fatal argument against \"de-platforming.\"  The other one, namely the distinction between \"publisher\" and \"platform\", as it pertains to social media, is also fatal.  \n\n[Link](http:\/\/voxday.blogspot.com\/2018\/10\/godaddy-bans-gab.html)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"In case any of you still support \"de-platforming\" on the grounds of \"muh private companies\""}

I'm just a single person, but I can't imagine having a family to care for while having these same values. I can't imagine working the multiple jobs, with a family, and then never being able to see your family because of always being at work.\n\nI live in a state with at-will employment. That means an employer can just fire you, for absolutely no reason, without any notice. That means we should be thankful and groveling to employers because being able to afford food is a luxury! Being able to live indoors too! Without a safety net, you are in constant worry that you could come in to work and lose *everything*. With the low pay that comes with many of these jobs, you don't always have a safety net. Your income, your insurance... gone. Your grocery money. Your home. \n\nI wish I could be a healthy person, where the thought of not having medical insurance isn't the most horrifying thing in the world. I don't have that luxury. I have a mental illness. I need medications that exist solely so I don't kill myself (although, of course, that's one of the side effects). We have have several skid rows and homeless camps out here, and many of those people also have a mental illness. In a heartbeat, that could be my life. I am told that I should be thankful, but I can't help but be absolutely livid about the fact that it seems as though no one cares about these people. They shuffle them around, arrest them for absolutely no reason. These are PEOPLE. It tells me that in a heartbeat, no one would care about me either.\n\nSo I work, to afford the insurance, to pay for my medicines, so I don't die. While living with the constant fear of losing it all at any moment. All the while, I'm exhausted. I'm depressed. I'm anxious. I often wonder, why am I just torturing myself to stay alive just to be miserable even longer?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\nI'm sure there are many out there who wonder the same thing.","subreddit":"socialism","title":"American Capitalism is going to kill me.""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"American Capitalism is going to kill me."}

Though the sideline rules of the sub reject racism, the proof is in the pudding. Any length of time lurking in that sub and you will discover it's anti-semetic and homophobic underbelly. Sadly, these comments and posts are not removed and the sub itself is riddled with calls for violence against both Jews and Muslims - Further to this it makes use to Anti-semetic memes which are disguised as something else, their use of the NPC meme further adds to the idea that Muslims and Jews and women and gays are not human while encouraging violence against them.   \n\n\nTheir defense of alleged alcoholic rapist Kavanaugh is yet another notch in their belt of venom against the vulnerable, to attack victims of rape, and promote a rapist as some kind of moral paragon and man of the people shines a light on the kind of thinking that is rife in that sub.  \n\n\nWe, as decent humans who stand up for whats right, we on \/r\/socialism and other subs which defend those who are wrongfully attacked must call on \/u\/spez to remove this subreddit and ban it entirely. We must put an end to a subreddit which propagates false news, hate, violence against minorities, hate against immigrants, they constantly launch attacks against poor, migrants from central and south america who are simply looking for a better life.   \n\n\nIf \/u\/spez will not take a stand against hate, we need a new site admin who will.

I lost my job, didn't pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won't release it.\n\nI was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (I'm not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest I didn't even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something I did not do). I had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where I was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. I'm not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn't say anything I told him to at this appearance I had because a simple background check shows I don't have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened I was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). He literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (Judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).\n\nSo then I sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. I tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper I had but he was never in and never came to see me. I couldn't afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. I don't really have family or super close friends to call for help, I was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because I can't pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months I'm about to owe.\n\nWhen he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the DA who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter I mailed them until then also. After that appearance I got a \"sorry, computer error you are free to go\" and I was released.\n\nWhat can I do for any of this? Apparently someone with the same name but a different DOB shot a building after a fight and is a felon but I sat in jail, lost my job, can't even get my car back they say unless I pay some crazy fees (how am I liable for these fees if it was a error?!). This is in Madison, Wisconsin\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies guys and gals, I'll contact the Wisconsin branch of the ACLU tomorrow and see what they say and where to go from here. Also I appreciate the messages offering to help me if I need it but I can kinda survive frugally on my credit cards if absolutely need be and will be contacting my boss tomorrow also and explaining the situation.\n\nEDIT 2: To clear up more confusion about my car. The city had it towed by a local company they are contracted with. The storage fees are $1900 and growing daily and I only paid $3500 for the car 2 years ago. The towing company that has my vehicle told me the city can waive their percentage and pay the rest to them and I can get my car but told \"good luck\". Also their policy is to only store the vehicles for 90 days before auctioning the car.","subreddit":"legaladvice","title":"I was arrested, kept in jail for 62 days and then released after the DA finally got around to my case.

I grew up very conservative, even though it always felt very constrictive and hypercritical. Once I started really thinking about what I believed and researching what I thought, I connected with libertarianism. I'm discovering a lot about my opinions and views and am continuously expanding and growing my perception. One subject that I keep coming to a dead end on is abortion. I'm having a hard time letting go of my traditional upbringing and I want to make sure that I believe what I do because I truly believe it's the right way and not because of tradition. I think it'd be very helpful if I could hear a few pro-choice views, particularly on overcoming the idea that a fetus is a human that holds value and has rights, as that is the area where I get caught up on.   Any input or POV is welcome, I'm pretty open minded and love hearing other opinions, regardless of if we end up agreeing or not. Thanks, guys. \n\nLoooonnggg edit: Thankyou all for your responses! To be fair, I absolutely expected hatred and anger as that is exactly what happened when I opened up the conversation on a rather liberal page in an attempt to understand.  I can tell some of you are understanding where I'm coming from and that's a beautiful thing to me. Have no fear, though, I try to allow only intelligent and thoughtful conversations to sway my mind, so the negative reactions really can't compete with my drive to understand. There's billions of people on the planet, I bet more than a few care about their cause enough to explain it to me. I'll keep an eye on this, in case anyone pops in says something that resonates. \n\nFor clarification, the reason why I'm struggling so much is because it is someone else's body and I don't feel comfortable dictating what they do with it. The part that gets me is whether or not it's another life, completely innocent (as in, it doesn't choose to commandeer another's body) but dependent on it's mother, has the same rights. Why is it not a life and why does it not hold the same Constitutional rights? For example, the only thing that seems to define \"life\" in the law is desire for the fetus. If a pregnant woman is killed, it's often double homicide. But if a pregnant woman decides to abort, it's not a life. So that is where my confusion comes in and I've yet to come across someone willing to explain it to me. I'm sure if I'm patient, someone will show up. Thanks again, guys!","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Pro choice\/pro life confusion"}

{"author":"theabstract23","created_utc":1540989024,"num_comments":73,"score":12,"selftext":"Hi, so I'm still a bit undecided on my political affiliation at this point; I used to consider myself a liberal up until about the beginning of the year. But now with Trump, the left has completely lost its mind and I no longer affiliate with hardly \\*anything\\* the left has to say. Honestly, it's hard not to since my demographic (straight white male here) is being specifically targeted. So now here I am rethinking my whole political affiliation. But I like Libertarianism. There is just one idea I have that is decidedly un-Libertarian that I can't seem to get past that I'd like you all to consider. Universal Basic Income, and the abolishment of minimum wage as well as welfare, food stamps, disability, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt any rate, Libertarianism really clicks with me in a lot of ways. I find myself agreeing with a lot of its views. But, it seems like it is very much supportive of the free market, which I agree is mostly fair. However, there are still many problems in society, mostly caused by the disparity between incomes. Not to mention, we're in for big changes with the rise of automation which will eliminate millions of jobs. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is where I think a UBI comes in. This could be granted to everyone below a certain income level, say below $75k\/year. ([see](https:\/\/sc.cnbcfm.com\/applications\/cnbc.com\/resources\/files\/2015\/12\/11\/emotionandincomeCHART2-01.png)) Now if you're above said income, you could exchange your UBI in exchange for a tax break, something like, say a certain amount per month or year. However, the benefit received would stay the same across the board for everyone making over $75k, to make it fair. The point being that the more you make, the less of your income is being represented by the benefits, and the less you'll miss it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo why UBI, and where does this fit in with Libertarianism? Where to begin. Alright, let's start with homelessness. If everyone in the US making less than $75k\/year (which is around 60%) started receiving say, a $600\/month UBI there would be unrivaled demand for affordable housing. This would be a good time to be in real estate. And boom, homelessness gone. Well, mostly. Let's look at criminal activity next. Now obviously we have a long way to go with our criminal justice system, but I think it's clear we should only really be locking up violent criminals, but that's an argument for another time. So how would UBI help alleviate criminal activity? Simple, take it away. Temporarily of course. Just as long as you are in jail\/on probation, in drug treatment, or however long it is suspended as per your sentencing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis brings me to my next point, which is closely related to criminal activity: personal responsibility. If everyone makes the same base wage, there would be no excuses. Everyone has equal opportunity, more so than now because poverty would no longer be an excuse. Since everyone gets the same benefits and opportunity, many socioeconomic issues could disappear. It would also be a huge boost to local economies, meaning we could eliminate a lot of ghettos, or just bad areas is one mere generation. Ok, so what about joblessness, unemployment? Wouldn't people just stop working? I don't think so. On the contrary, I think it would create a lot of job opportunities. There would be a sudden demand for affordable products everywhere. Anyone could be an entrepreneur. The aforementioned boost in local economies could gentrify a lot of bad areas and give people in those areas more opportunities. I believe there would still be a percentage of people who would do nothing, but at least they could contribute to their household financially, and overall those people would represent a minority and lead to only a negligible loss. Generally, I think boredom and a need to do something with their lives would drive most people.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow for jobs themselves. Do you ever notice that minimum wage workers usually give \"minimum wage\" performances? Now imagine if every minimum wage worker's needs were being met, and they came to work because they \\*wanted to\\*? Imagine a world where someone could happily say they make $10 an hour. Imagine if employers could pay $3 an hour for unskilled jobs (think 16-year old dishwasher just looking for work experience) you might even be able to afford to employ two of them to lighten the load. Well, wouldn't taxes be out of control? Not necessarily. With a UBI we wouldn't need a lot of the government-funded programs we have now. Plus a lot of the money would go right back into our economy. Point is, society needs a lot of work. I think this could be a step in the right direction.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, is this un-Libertarian? I don't think it is. The simple fact is this is a pretty niche political party, and some of the things this party would like to accomplish probably can't be done with the omnipresent two-party system. This could be a way where everyone wins. And I hope I made a case for how that benefits this party.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr Do you think a Universal Basic Income could work? Do you like the idea of it, or is it inherently an un-Libertarian concept?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd happily debate it in the comments, and I'm open to changing my mind.
