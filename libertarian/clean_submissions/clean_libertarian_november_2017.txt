Here is a list of reasons.\n\n1. Laws against drugs only deter law abiding citizens.  Addicts are not typically law abiding citizens.  \n\n2.  Addicts who were living on the street would flood to these facilities.  There would be no need to incarcerate them.\n\n3. Drug use is typically a symptom rather than the cause of problems.

Drug use at the facility would be safer due to purity and no need to share needles.\n\n7.  Sadly, if some addicts are given all the drugs the desire they will kill themselves.

{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1509915642,"num_comments":100,"score":243,"selftext":"Hey guys! I am an MD, a current surgical resident planning to specialize in trauma surgery, and a proud classical liberal. I wanted to give my fellow free thinkers some arguing points against the Sanders sympathizers and advocates for single payer in the US. Here are my thoughts on why having the government control the healthcare system is already a terrible idea and why moving to single payer would only exacerbate things.\n\n1) Healthcare is not a right. It is an industry in which people provide goods and services to those who need it. Therefore, the highest quality and lowest costing healthcare would be a product of the free market, not from government control. \n\n- We already have a quasi government controlled industry and it accounts for a large portion of federal expenditures - so how would making the industry entirely run by the govt less expensive or more efficient?\n\n- The only places in the healthcare industry where costs are dropping are in areas not under government control (IE not dependent on medicare/medicaid). Look at things like laser eye surgery, cosmetic surgery, concierge medicine, and direct primary care.\n\n2) Heavy regulations and arduous licensing practices are keeping costs high and preventing new businesses and people from entering the market. They would only get worse with more government influence in healthcare.\n\n- Nurses, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners could perform many duties that doctors are still obligated to do. They could perform those services at cheaper costs but are not allowed to. Again, regulations drive up unnecessary costs. \n\n- You have never heard of doctors having difficulty finding work. They are constantly in high demand because their labor market is highly regulated and its supply is purposely kept low. This drives up costs and reduces access to care. This would get worse with single payer. Instead of more people entering the labor market and meeting demand, you would have less. We already see this in Canada where waiting for elective surgery can take months because there is minimal incentive to go into surgery.    \n\n- The excessive burdens of getting FDA approval for new medication or devices is outrageous. The cost carries directly onto patients. It also dis-incentivizes companies from making medications due to lack of financial incentive. Again, something that would get worse when only a single entity is controlling the piggy bank and making the rules. \n\n- Imagine a service that sent you a blood pressure monitor to your home and it recorded your blood pressure data over a certain period of time. Then imagine it gave you advice on how to lower your blood pressure and sent you your medication in the mail. All without ever having to see a doc. This would be a great free market solution that would surely drop costs - never to occur under a single payer system.\n\n- Imagine an eye exam done using your computer and then having your prescription sent to your home. All without ever needing to see an eye specialist. You think the govt would allow this and pay for it? Those optometrists and ophthalmologists would probably lobby against it.  \n\n- Most providers are limited in practice based on their state licensure. An American doctor practicing in California cannot practice medicine in another state until they apply and pay for licensing in that state. This costs a lot of time and money. It also makes no sense. And these types of barriers on providers are everywhere. Again, I don't understand how having the government completely take over health care would help reduce any of these over-burdensome regulations.\n\n3) Most healthcare dollars are spent on billing/red-tape rather than patient care, by a large margin. It seems illogical that having the govt take over the healthcare industry would eliminate the govt created and enforced ICD-10 billing codes. \n\n- This is something that Sanders accurately points out and I agree with him on. It's a huge problem. Hospitals spend a large portion of their budgets on billing in order to maximize their reimbursements from insurance companies and medicare/medicaid. I don't understand how moving to single payer would improve this. You would still have hospitals and practices negotiating with \u201cMedicare for All\u201d for reimbursements. Additionally, the government will decide the cost of everything, not market forces. We all know how good the govt is at price control right?\n\n- If a surgery is going to cost a hospital $x to perform it but the govt will only reimburse 75% of x, where is the incentive to perform the surgery in the first place? (PS this already happens but would become worse)\n\n- Doctors now have to see more patients in less time because they know they will receive a low reimbursement for the visits and need to pay all the extra staff in order to bill for the reimbursement appropriately.\n\n- A great counterexample to this is direct primary care where patients pay a monthly fee to their primary care doctor\u2019s office. The doctor does not accept insurance so she/he needs less staff, can spend more time with patients, and tell her/his patients how much things will actually cost.\n\n4) We should be able to get our care and our meds from whomever is providing the best product at the lowest price. \n\n- Another point that Sanders brings up that I agree with (He says that Americans should be able to buy their meds from Canada if they are cheapest). I agree. I should be able to buy my medication from whomever sells it the cheapest or provides that best/most reliable product. Why can\u2019t I order medication to my door Amazon-Prime style? Who cares if my meds come from Canada? (I buy my cars from Europe and my electronics from Japan - why should medication or health services be any different?)  Who cares if the doctor or healthcare provider I choose to see did their training somewhere else? If they are good at their job and offer a quality service at a reasonable price, I should be able to see whom I want.\n- It always puzzles me when Sanders points to the free market as the solution to the overpriced medication problem but it's the cause of all other problems in terms of education and healthcare as a whole.\n\n5) Most of the new drugs/medical devices/vaccinations are products of the US biotech industry. \n\n- That\u2019s right. The vast majority of medications produced have been at the hands of the US biotech companies - Ugh, shame on those greedy capitalist pigs for developing life saving medication all for non altruistic means. How many new drugs has Sanders\u2019 beloved Denmark produced comparatively - and where are the majority of those drug sold? \n\n- By going single payer and the govt controlling drug prices, where will be the financial incentive for companies to develop new drugs? (PS they are already heavily regulated by the FDA and it prevents new companies, medications, and devices from entering the market) - I believe the single payer system will surely exacerbate this even further.  \n\n6) If the Sander\u2019s left opposes the obscene spending practices of government run industry like the military, why would they expect the same thing not to happen with govt run medicine?\n\n- A single payer system would lead to Big Pharma influencing big money deals in Washington. Which biotech company will emerge as the Boeing or Lockheed Martin of govt-run healthcare? Surely we can trust our leaders to negotiate deals that are fiscally responsible - right?\n\n- Again, another contradiction from Sanders and his supporters. We see headlines all the time of govt projects that come in way over budget. I would agree with all the Sanders supporters that something like the F-35 program which is now 200 billion dollars over budget is a waste of taxpayer dollars. When will we start seeing similar headlines for govt funded deals with big pharma that were grossly underestimated?\n\n7) Finally, Denmark. You know, that country with free everything - a true socialist paradise. It is the shining example that Sanders always points to. The country that is 90+% Caucasian, has 5 million people, has personal income tax around 60% with a corporate tax rate of 20% (US corporate tax rate 35%). A country that has an &gt;100% sales tax on cars and heavy sales tax in general. A country that requires minimal defense spending and has made significant efforts to dissuade/prevent immigrants and asylum seekers from entering the nation. It is simply not a model we can follow.\n\n- The first question I always ask any Sanders supporters who bring up Denmark is why hasn't Bernie tried to emulate Denmark in his home state. Vermont is mostly Caucasian with a small population of like minded individuals. Why not demonstrate this Denmarkian Utopia you speak of in your home state and show the rest of America that your socialist vision could work. If you cannot do it in Vermont, how would you do it in the nation at large? \n\n- If we are going to emulate Denmark, then we should also adopt their tax structure. How many Bernie supporters would be for doubling the federal income tax on individuals and simultaneously lowering the corporate tax rate? \n\n- Denmark has similar issues that Canada does - more people waiting to see specialists or waiting elective surgery. Additionally, a large portion the medications and devices used in Denmark were produced by the big pharma companies Sanders hates so much.\n\n- Finally, the transparency of the Danish government is something that you would never see in the USA. \n\nTL:DR: The essential argument against single payer goes as follows: \n\n- Healthcare is not a right, it is an industry. Industries maximize their potential under free market forces (lowest cost with highest quality). I believe allowing the government to take over the healthcare industry will do quite the opposite (high costs, poor quality). \n\n- Regulations impede access to care and inflate costs. These regulations would only increase with more government involvement.\n\n- The more the government regulates an industry, the more big corporations use regulations to control the market for their benefits.\n\n- We should be able to get whatever medication/health care we want from who we want\n\n- Stop trying to make Denmark happen.     \n\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading. I hope this gives you guys some ammo next time you get into a debate. I will be more than happy to discuss free market solutions to healthcare in a separate post. We need to continue to work hard to protect freedom. \n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Hey guys! I am an MD and proud libertarian.

Others disagree. Being in the STEM field has made me try to solve this dilemma empirically. Let's have an experiment to test the hypothesis that taxation is theft. The first step is to determine what we are testing and how to tease that out from everything else. Obviously, theft can only occur when the transfer of whatever is being considered here is involuntary. To state this more clearly, something that can only be obtained through force is theft; however its contrapositive is not true. You can always take something when someone is unaware of you having taken it. For the purpose of this experiment, it is true, though. Something is taken involuntarily if that something can only be obtained through force. So this is a fine matrix to determine if it is in fact theft or possibly not theft.\n\nIn order to test this, we must get rid of the issue of force from the equation. Currently, not paying your taxes is illegal and will result in your arrest. Resist this arrest and even more force will be used to take you in up to and including lethal force. The easiest way to do that in the USA is to get the president to pardon all people from paying taxes this fiscal year. Now we will have to wait and see come tax day. \n\nIf people continue paying taxes according to the law, despite there not being force, it proves that taxation is not theft, because people are paying their taxes willingly without force. If people do not pay taxes in accordance with the law without the threat of force, then it proves that taxation is theft, as it is only being acquired through the use of force.\n\nThis is a very simple experiment that will be able to determine the truth value of the phrase, \u201ctaxation is theft.\u201d","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Is taxation theft?

An acquaintance who I knew is an atheist was the first person I told, little did I know his views were sjwish and he supports atheism plus and wants communism.\n\n\nBy 2014, I became more interested in gaming, and built my first true gaming pc, I was aware of Anita Sarkessian's scam I knew it was bullshit, but didn't give a damn about it.\n\n\nBy 17 July 2015, the garbage crisis broke out in my country, because the main landfill had to close, it made the streets smell like rotting corpses as well as the electricity blackouts have became 15 hours per day at least. A movement was created in response to the crisis, I joined it, most of them were leftists even some where communists, I befriended them learned some politics from them, and started discussing politics with the atheism plus guy, he indoctrinated me that capitalism is evil, I believed him. \n\n\nBy fall 2016, I had to sign up for a gender studies course, I got indoctrinated into feminism, and that the patriarchy is out there to get all women.\nBy the end of the semester I started rewatching TJ Kirk's videos, and he made a video criticising feminism, he convinced me it is unecessary in the west, but somewhat necessary for my country. There was a sign up for the intersectional feminist club at my uni, the president of the club told me because I am cis het male, I will be only allowed to speak last, she also told me that both the Palestinian and Syrian conflicts is feminist issue is because women suffer more, I reply but 97% of combat deaths are male, and in Syria even young boys are drafted. She gets triggered, and replies you need to check your cis-het male privilege and stop mansplaining.\n\n\n\nI woke up, from sjwism and became a social democrat, then I watched a video where Peter Schiff goes to occupy wall street and tells the protesters that free market capitalism is their only solution and the difference between corporatism and capitalism, he convinced me well except for universal healthcare and education.\n\n\n\nI became an MRA, so on women's day I attended a seminar on women's issues to voice my dissent in order to find a common ground but no luck at all, they all believed that the cops and judges should believe all rape accusers because rape victims are scared to report the crime for fear of being not taken seriously, my response was the reason why many true victims are afraid to report the crime is because many rape claims are false, they told me to stop mansplaining. One time I made a joke on \"why women have boobs so you got something to look while you are talking to them\" a lot of people from the movement I mentioned above got triggered one white knight he is very physically strong threatened me with violence.\n\n\n I then got convinced that feminism is a way of social engineering perpetuated by the Rockefellers.\nAnd since I am into conspiracy theories and don't trust governments and big pharma and the indoctrinatational *cough*  educational system, then let the free market take care of them.

After the first few hab-fabrication generations (20-40 years), the cost of hab real estate drops below most desirable earth real estate.\n\nCounter to the current thinking, the largest fortune from asteroid processing will not be dropping rare-earths into the outback, but creating limitless comfortable real estate, and because of that being the linchpin of unimaginable population and economic expansion.\n\nThere are 2 things required to start this: \n\n1.) One company/nation/entity has to build one mega-hab, and so bootstrap spaceborne industrial infrastructure; after that, the plant is in space that is able to build more plant in space given material. (Which is out there, just freaking floating, hardly any fuel needed to get to it.  And, unlike on earth, needing waaay less energy to break it apart (mine it) than to actually refine and process it, because the gravity holding a small asteroid together is almost nothing.) \n\n2.) There HAS to be a legal framework so that things progress gracefully without massively destructive competition.\n\nPossible answers: Just do it. Then ask permission.  This is how it will happen.  But there must be a framework in place that will prevent common harm.  The first movers will be able to create this framework.  So this isn't the final answer.  Perhaps the US should lead a multilateral effort to create a charter colony system?  Again, the US or US entities could go ahead and fab[ricate] and profit from some hab[itat]s already before creating a globally politically acceptable system after the fact that just happens to grandfather in what's already been done without being bald-faced about it.

The plot involves a man who was like the son of the dictator of the Communist regime maybe. However, due to some plot fluke he had been educated outside of the typical indoctrination/propaganda schools of the regime - so was essentially a free thinker - but still knows nothing of free markets, capitalism, or really economics at all.\n\nHis father dies and suddenly he's put in charge of the entire Communist apparatus. He has an ... advisor of some kind ... a former aide of his father I believe. Almost immediately he's faced with a problem taking place in the territory. But instead of the typical approach his father would have taken, he considers the problem and suggests a policy that results in some market autonomy by individuals - and despite the warnings of the advisor and other detractors, the policy fix actually works and improves the situation. Soon thereafter another issue comes up and his response again is contrary to the Communist line of thought, but is successful. Again and again he's faced with issues, and deals with them, without being any kind of capitalist ideologue, with a policy that is actually fairly free market. By the end of the book the communistic aspects of the country have been largely dismantled, but just addressing each issue with allowing people to do as they wish, he had created a largely market economy in which the people as a whole were growing more and more prosperous. \n\nThere may be a war/battle going on during all this as well.\n\nNow I've always had in my head that it was written by Garet Garrett, but now that I'm looking for it, I cannot seem to find the book in his list, so that seems to be inaccurate.\n\nAny help identifying this book would be appreciated.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Help with finding book"}

But, now that it has happened, are we morally on the hook to make good on the promise of repaying that debt?  Ideally as fast as possible?  Or, are we at least morally on the hook to not ignore it and pass it off to our own children and their children?\n\nI think this is a case that isn't covered well by libertarian doctrine - solving the problems of the non-libertarian past that, strictly speaking, we wouldn't have the tools to solve directly (i.e. taxation).  So, I find that we are in fact on the hook to *at least* pay off debt.  Beyond that, we may be on the hook to pay for virtually nothing, but I think this is a special case.\n\nThoughts?

I posted the following on social media on Nov 9, 2016:\n\n\n\"I refused to let this election be another choice between the lesser of two evils. I refused to vote for more government, more wars, more erosion of civil liberties. I voted for a candidate with executive experience that was socially liberal and fiscally conservative that strove for civil rights and freedom of choice.\n\nI voted FOR a Presidential candidate that I believed was fully capable of high office and was aligned with my values for governing, rather than having voted for someone with whom I did not see as capable or honest in order to keep a much-maligned demagogue out of office. Depending on who you talked to, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were interchangeable in that sense.\n\nI was told that this election was too important to cast a protest vote. Certain swing states were too close to call, and voting for someone other than a Democrat or Republican would tip the scales in an unfavorable direction. \"A vote for Johnson is a vote for Trump!\" \"A vote for Johnson is a vote for Hillary!\" \"Voting third party could sway the election! Don't you remember what happened with Ralph Nader? He cost Al Gore the election and got George W. Bush elected President!\"\n\nIn an interview in 2004, Nader was asked about spoiling the election for Gore, to which he responded, \"What about Gore spoiling the election for me?\" Many people, especially Democrats, assumed that Nader took votes away from Gore. Now, many are trying to liken Gary Johnson to Nader. But they are mistaken in believing that Johnson \"took\" votes away from Clinton. They are mistaken in believing that, were it down to just Clinton vs. Trump, they would vote en masse for Clinton. That is downright wrong and disingenuous. Supporters of Gary Johnson were a combination of disenfranchised Democrats and Republicans alike, along with those with no party affiliation. They, along with myself, were tired of what seemed like business-as-usual in Washington.\n\nWas a vote for Gary Johnson and Bill Weld a protest vote? You're damn right it was. It was a protest against how things have been going in Washington. It was a protest against the two-party duopoly. It was a protest against the NSA and unconstitutional surveillance of American citizens. It was a protest of the erosion of civil liberties. It was a protest against the Obama administration's continuous involvement in foreign affairs. It was a protest against drone strikes. It was a protest against Hillary Clinton continuing the same terrible choices of the last eight years.\n\nBut it was also a protest against Donald Trump. A protest against a man who was running solely to feed his ego; with no knowledge of the Constitution of the United States and how the office of President works. It was a protest against building a wall. It was a protest against deporting over 10 million undocumented workers, without whom our daily lives would be altered. It was a protest against a man with a short temper and irrational behavior.\n\nI do not regret my decision one bit. I can firmly state that I voted my conscience in 2016. A lot of you are angry. A lot of you are happy. Had the election been won by Hillary Clinton, I would see the same argument from a different set of friends and family members.\n\nEmotions were running high last night. I read vitriolic and hurtful comments from both Trump and Clinton supporters alike. But now that things have settled down, we must all take a deep breath and acknowledge that what has happened is not an end to everything. The sun still rose in the East, and it will set tonight in the West.\n\nBut for you and I, the most important thing to remember in all of this, is that the Chicago Cubs are your 2016 World Series Champions.\nGo Cubs Go.\"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"A year ago today, we all woke up to the news of Donald Trump being elected President of the United States..."}

I couldn't find one anywhere.  I did find the below though by a [psychologist]( http://nationalpsychologist.com/2014/09/mass-shooters-received-only-limited-treatment/102638.html).\n\n&gt;\"The real problem, in my opinion, is the quality and competence of therapy for potential violent offenders when insurance companies are the gatekeepers.\"\n\nIgnoring the Freedom component what would it actually cost?\n\n\nMy hypothesis is\n\nEasy access to guns + poor treatment for mental issues= mass shootings.\n\nHow do you change that math? You will never remove all mass shootings, even Canada has 8 mass shootings per 100 million people.  We currently have [50-100](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/no-matter-how-you-measure-them-mass-shooting-deaths-are-up/) people a year die in mass shootings.  If we lowered our rate of shootings to Canada's it would decrease to 15-33 per year roughly a third.  To prevent 35-66 deaths per year we would have to change gun laws &amp; enforcement or provide better mental health treatment.  How much would that cost?  \n\nGun Control Cost : California has a program to compare guns registered to arrests and mental issues, so state troopers can go hunt down people that were legal to own but no longer are. It costs them around $775 to clear a case, ie visit the offender and search their house.   With around 100M gun owners it would cost 77B on the very low end to hunt down illegal guns.  I say on the low end due to the fact that California has reasonably strict registration of guns, Texas or Missouri would be way harder to track gun owners down.  Probably more on the order of 250B.  So on the low end it would cost roughly 1 billion per death saved high end would be 7B per death saved.  If you added in all [murders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate) as well, aiming for  Canada's murder rate we would cut murders roughly by 2/3 as well 9000 gun homicides a year down to 3000.  Low end 12M per life saved, High end 41M per life saved.  Now that's only year one, but I still think 250B is a low number as well.  Chasing down 360M guns is going to be very very hard.  Australia banned almost all guns, 20 years ago.  They are still hunting them down, and having new ones snuck in.  All of this would have to happen after a repeal of the second amendment of course.  \n\nMental Health Cost: Since most mass murders were already under some kind of treatment, single payer is not going to be the solution as it wouldn't change anything.  That leads me to two options, either increase the level of care across the board, or find a way to target potential mass murderers.  Total spending on all mental health issues was roughly 200B last year in the US, to use the template from the above article you would have to increase visits from once every 3 weeks to twice a week a 6X increase.  1.2T to prevent 66 murders a year or 18B per life saved.  Not counting the 6X psychologists and other specialists that would need to be trained for ever more.  On the mental health side, researching ways to detect mass murders would probably be the cheapest way, but I really have no idea how to estimate that cost.  \n\nThe Department of Transportation uses a working number of [3.3 Million](http://bca.transportationeconomics.org/benefits/safety/valuing-accidents) per life saved as a cost benefit number for approving safety projects.  We could all drive 10MPH and save all lives, but the cost in lost productivity, fuel, time is too great. It seems until somebody can detect murder before it happens we're stuck with murder.  \n\n\nI did this because I wanted to work out what it would cost myself.  \n\nTL;DR Preventing Mass Murders would cost a shit ton.  Only NASA spends more per life saved.  ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Cost of a Life"}

There are ways to get this without paying taxes (e.g. its such a little sum that people won't bother with paper work and taxes)\"\n\nWhich contradicted their earlier statement that participating = consent. \n\nGoing by this logic, if the government imposed forced segregation on blacks, raised taxes on their incomes to 99% at any level and then charged them $1000 for passports to leave the country, the blacks were at fault as they voluntarily participated in the system and didn't leave the country.\n\nI put forward this logical test:\n\n\"Going by this logic, nothing can ever be immoral because you passively consented by being there. If I went into someones house and they said \"I am going to rape you, leave now if you don't want to be raped\", I go to the door and they say \"you need this bit of paper to leave, pay me $10 or you can't leave\", have I consented to then being raped?\"\n\nI got this reply\n\n\" assume you mean have they consented to being raped, and no, A) This rule was added without there agreement so they did not consent, by a party without the authority to do so, and less importantly B) you cannot consent to being raped, that is logically impossible.\"\n\nEssentially saying that government has the right to impose actions because they have the 'authority'. Completely ridiculous, why would the government have any more authority to impose immoral actions on their land than a private landowner would? \n\nSome other replies by them:\n\nI said would the government be able to forcibly impregnate women if they still are in the country at 20, they said:\n\n\"Probably not, most people seem to agree that bodily autonomy is a right and this would violate it.\"\n\nSo rights are arbitrarily defined by what 'people' think and that is the basis for all judging of government morality. So it can be changed whenever. \n\nMost people think property is a right but this person agreed with taking it by force.\n\nThis is just a selection, but all the replies I got were entirely morally subjective. They somehow believe that people can delegate powers that they themselves do not have, which therefore allows for otherwise immoral actions to be undertaken. As if stealing is somehow okay if you delegate that 'right' to the government. \n\nStatist logical can justify literally anything.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Statist subjectivity allows for any immoral action"}

Their average income gap compared to neurotypicals is even wider than the average income gap between men and women (drexel). Even though the majority of young adults with language and learning disabilities do live independently, less than a quarter of young adults on the spectrum do (ncbi). They're also incredibly more likely to be socially isolated than not only neurotypicals but also other people with mental disorders. There tends to be more overlap between transgender people and autistic people (theatlantic). I have previously read that their issues are largely due to their difficulties in social scenarios.

They're not \"banning\" anyone so much as saying that they're under no obligation to continue putting up with you. Often, you have the same leverage to use yourself: if a store pisses you off to the point where you're gonna do something banworthy....stop giving them your money.\n\nToo often, and particularly if one side is larger or more powerful, we are taught that they have fewer rights than us to the same things.

Standing up for your own rights while respecting theirs very quickly weeds out both people you have no right demanding shit from, as well as leeches doing the same to you.\n\nThe relation to libertarianism, of course, is that unchecked entitlement rapidly seems to grow into demands for the force of government to be used to deprive others of liberty (the right) or property (the left).","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Getting over an entitlement mentality helped me so much with life"}

Society can and does execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself. Protection, therefore, against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough: there needs protection also against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling; against the tendency of society to impose, by other means than civil penalties, its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent from them; to fetter the development, and, if possible, prevent the formation, of any individuality not in harmony with its ways, and compel all characters to fashion themselves upon the model of its own.

For instance, most would say that it should be illegal to threaten someone, or scream \"fire!\" in a non-burning theatre. Are these exceptions considered part of a libertarian view on free speech?

I think that social programs are generally good (help for those under the poverty line, publicly funded schooling, etc.), but I understand the somewhat darwinistic view of 'assistance disincintivizes growth'. Why is lack of assistance the better path?\n\n2) I think the concept of a fully free market makes sense, especially in historical context, but in a world where government is the norm, is this a feasible course of action? Can a free market truly be competitive when other nations have ranging government intervention?\n\n3) What I see more than anything else is a dislike of taxes among libertarians (which of course makes sense, as does the dislike of the government paying private companies with tax money to maintain/repair infrastructure), but I have always wondered who would pay for this if government did not. I understand that private companies usually are contracted to fix roads, etc., but where would the incentive for the company (money) come from if not from a body that is able to aggregate and allocate funds from the public? I would happily give money directly to a company that would maintain a road, but I would expect others to do so as well. How is this different than taxation? (I think it's important to consider this last without the loss of tax revenue to government ineptitude, as that is an inefficiency, not an argument against aggregation and community).\n\nI know this is long, but I genuinely want to hear your thoughts.

Almost all reputable science that has been produced both independently and by the government suggests vaccinations are a necessary good for society as a whole. However when you independently choose to vaccinate your child you are making a decision for them without their explicit consent. But if you fail to make that choice, you may make an irresponsible decision that could end their life, whereas they did not know magnitude of the decision, essentially robbing them from a healthy and normal life.\n\nFurther if you choose not to vaccinate and your child infects a vaccinated population, your choice took the liberty from other children who most would say acted correctly. Then if that vaccinated population ostracized your child and prevented any interactions, your choice again influenced the liberty of your child.\n\nThe main point is that liberty is essential in this philosophy but for those who cannot be asked to make rational choices at their age cannot be expected to have freedom in choice. In either situation, by choosing to vaccinate or not, your decision robs them of some liberty.\n\nWhat do you do when a choice restricts freedom of someone in either direction; do you do what is generally regarded as the safest and most rational choice, or operate under the notion of pure liberty?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Vaccinations Get Brought Up Frequently As A Divisive Issue But The Underlying Contradiction Is Interesting"}

A few people (top 1%) are getting wealthier and wealthier and now many of the self- made top 1%-ers are elderly and their wealth is going to be passed to their children, so that most of the people with most of the money will have inherited the wealth, rather than worked for it. I get that there are supposed to be wealthy and poor people or else we'd just be living in a communist society, but I think most of us can agree that 500,000 people (example number) should not be living with 99% of the money in our society.

When you fully swallow the red pill, you start to realize the Left has understood some truths which the Right was not willing or able to admit even to themselves. The Big Lie was \"individualism\" all along, which tried to pretend that groups don't matter, that race didn't matter. And the libertarian lies to himself in this way because he's been socially conditioned and emotionally brow-beaten for decades to fear being the caricature of the \"racist white man\" he's been fed his entire life. The Big Lie that \"philosophy\" and \"ideas\" matter more than hard biological truths and evolved human nature was a self-defense mechanism designed to protect the emotionally abused Right from being further abused by the more dominant Left.

I think most libertarians would agree that the free market is better off regulating itself; that consumers will make choices that bring about a better outcome than if government controlled it.  But then I look at the US news media, which is largely made up of private corporations.  They are motivated to publish stories that give them the most attention.  Consumers tend to lend their attention to stories of mass shootings, sex scandals, political bickering and other such events because they are so controversial.  So media companies, in turn, are incentvized to filter, embellish, or flat out lie about these hot button issues because it's what consumers are demanding - therefore the supply of this garbage is increased.   So we seem caught in this supply/demand cycle which keeps getting worse, where the news is losing it's integrity because consumers aren't demanding it.  Is the conclusion that, yes the media is bad, but still much better off than what a government-run media agency would produce?  Shouldn't the quality of the news media improve through the free market system, the same way other things do?

Sure there is semantic cross-over and muddiness, and the endemic and systemic problems feed on each other in a viscous circle, but the whole point of invoking the word systemic in the context of racism is to make this exact distinction! And to approach this problem productively there is no more important distinction to make.\n\nIf you have a moment try this thought experiment. However unlikely you think this is, imagine a line of people from the pen-holder drafting a piece of legislation, to the congress passing that legislation, to the governor receiving it all the way to the cop who actually goes out and makes arrests being a group of color-blind people who harbor no prejudice. I hold that it is still possible for the implementation of the law to be itself \"racist\", systemically.\n\nJust one example would base itself on the simple fact that policemen get raises and promotions by the same metrics as anyone else, by showing themselves to be busy. Police have a mandate. They're not like the ambulance, fire dept, or inspector who come only when they're called or at the designated time. Police go looking for trouble and when it can't be found they'll make it. And where would you go with such a mandate, perhaps combined with ambition or even just a family to feed depending on your productivity? Of course to the poorest neighborhoods where people can't afford to mount a legal defense and are vice-ridden due to have no clear vision of a way out of poverty. Isn't that why poorer people buy more cigarettes and lottery tickets?\n\nPolitical solutions aimed at helping the most impoverished among us will end up incidentally (and this is important) helping more black people than white and in a way that is totally equable, and therefore unimpeachable. This wont have the kind of backfire that you'd get from something like affirmative action which is, at it's core, (and there is no way around this) racist, as it discriminates one citizen form another based on their ethnicity.\n\nEndemic problems are not the kind of problems out of which we can legislate ourselves. Telling people what to think only makes them hate you. But legislation can change the **system;** it is the system. And The System can be called The System because it has a life of its own apart from the individuals that comprise it. We can at reduce racism in our system but such methods, the best methods for helping black people in America must necessarily NOT invoke their blackness. Here are just a couple examples off the top of my head:\n\n* Curb inflation and regressive tax policies that affect poor people the most\n* Stop subsidizing upper-middle class (White) jobs by devaluing our currency, which the poorest people need to retain its value. (This is what happens when the FED prints money to bail out a bank or car company)\n* End the drug war and mass incarceration of our citizens for profit by private prisons \n\n\nP.S. Do you want people like [Larry Elder to be able to keep straw-manning people like Dave Rubin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phPXTWJhnYM), knocking down one weak argument after another? He's rightly fact obsessed but what about the fact that my state, Iowa, (You'd think it'd be Mississippi or Alabama right? No it's here in a state that voted for Obama both times and is way north and west of the Mason-Dixon line) with an only 8-12% black population has a prison population of over 40% black!?

I have now published a book that I have written: Of Personal Liberty, The Truth of Motor Vehicle Infractions. If you have any time to spare, I\u2019d greatly appreciate your audience for my work.  \n\nWhat is my book about? Well, first off, I want to assert that my book is NOT a discussion about how to get out of traffic tickets. Rather and more importantly, my book aims to examine the legitimacy of traffic tickets, and in doing so teach people fundamental principles of law that everyone should know. \n\nAt its core, my book is a discussion about freedom\u2014in practical use. Specifically, the book enunciates the fact that if a person is free, they don\u2019t need to ask for anyone\u2019s permission before inclining to act. Americans today no longer practice freedom: it is illegal for us to do anything of sustenance unless we first acquire a \u2018license\u2019 or \u2018permit\u2019 (permission) from the government. \n\nOne of the many freedoms that have been deprived from Americans is their right to freely travel upon the highways. For a long time, we have been told that \u201cdriving is a privilege\u201d, but this is a grave misnomer. My central thesis is that people should not be forced to obtain a license (ask government\u2019s permission) nor meet other prerequisites before being allowed to privately travel upon the highways.  \n\nOur country\u2019s backbone was designed to support a free society. Requiring everyone to get a driver\u2019s license before they can travel upon the highways has led to a form of scoliosis; Constitutional provisions have been grossly reinterpreted, and basic principles of fairness (due process) are being ignored, in order to sustain our current trafficking system.   \n\nI\u2019ve put thousands of hours of work into this book. Anyone who knows me, knows that I am diligent when it comes to my projects. I wouldn\u2019t disseminate a publication unless I felt it met an acceptable standard of quality.

However, the community backlash has made EA remove the pay-to-win aspects of the game completely due to many people refunding and boycotting EA, as is possible in a free market. I cant help but think the same thing will happen to ISPs if they do the things that the pro net neutrality campaigners have been warning about - the companies will be boycotted and will suffer a net loss as a result. I can't say i'm anti-net neutrality, but I feel that a lot of people overblow the consequences massively of no net neutrality to the point of lying which has inclined me to doubt their claims.\n\n[Anyway, here's that article I was talking about.](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/comments/7d8hnb/the_recent_bullshit_with_ea_and_battlefront_is_a/)\n\nDoes anyone else agree with me, or am I comparing two completely separate things?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The backlash the gaming community has had on EA is a perfect example of the free market working as it should."}

I'm not sure if it's necessary to preface my post this way, but I'm talking about the US in the context of constitutionality.\n\nFor the sake of argument, that we assume some amount of taxes and welfare are required for satiating political factions in seeking progress towards liberty, would abolishing all forms of taxation, and in the place of those, implementing a nationwide consumption tax be acceptable?\n\nThe goal would be to eliminate as much unconstitutional activity as possible, such as the welfare state and cronyism, thereby restoring the constitutional limitations on fedzilla through the mechanism of extreme simplification (you know, enumerated powers and all that). The consumption tax would provide the revenue for federal responsibilities and a social safety net.\n\nFurther, I accept that there would be objections based on the premise that poorer people would be \"unfairly targeted\" for revenue generation, and submit the following compromise.\n\nIf we control for governmental ~~shenanigans- shenaniganry? Can I do that, just going around, making up words? Fuck it~~ -chicanery, such as fiat currency and monetary policy debasing the dollar, would universally excepting base essential goods (i.e. food in the form of groceries, among other things) from the consumption tax ameliorate that concern?\n\nIn my estimation, this would not only ameliorate a good bit of corruption and cronyism through shear reduction in opportunity, but would also serve to make transparent to the public the consequences of their representatives actions in both adjusting the tax rate (a single figure), and the provision of welfare policy in connection to revenues.  Simple math that is not impenetrable on the time scales of working people, provided the accounting is accurate and not obfuscated by aforementioned chicanery.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not advocating for this policy, and I hold no designs on the lives and product of men.

My experience is with the UK, but I am sure a lot of this applies to other countries including the US.\n\nQuite often I hear people complaining that they could have just read the powerpoint at home or watched a lecture recording. This happens quite often, people skip lectures and just watch recordings or read the resources in their own time. The whole idea of a lecture hall is a pretty big waste of money. Why do you need to have 50+ people in a room listening to the same lessons every year?\n\nPretty much everyone has high speed internet nowadays. A university could hire a lecturer to record a series of lectures and then provide access to this material for a fee. You'd use less physical space, you wouldn't have to pay for someone to repeat work etc. Outside of practical courses it seems fairly stupid to use a traditional university setting. Do you really need a lecture hall to teach someone economics? Lots of people learn online nowadays. Most libraries already have online accessible versions of most texts, the need to go to a physical location is pretty minor other than personal preference and physical specialist materials.\n\nI feel like a huge chunk of university could be cut and would probably provide better education.\n\nThere are already ideas like this in the marketplace, thegreatcoursesplus, youtube series, audiobooks etc. \n\nIn my mind I picture a university as somewhere that practical research and teaching would be held, whilst most other activities would be done remotely. This could significantly reduce the cost of education and improve quality. \n\nIf professor A is the best professor, why hire professor B when you could just rent the rights to professors A's lecture recordings? The best lecturers would sell more lectures, the bad ones would fail. This would also leave the university more resources to focus on 1 to 1 counselling and teaching and lecturers time would not be taken up repeating various lectures.

I have had to read a lot about the underlying issues and causes of the 2008 housing bubble and subsequent crash. \n\n\n1. Little to no loan qualifiers. Getting a home loan in 08 was easy. The rejection rate was practically none esxistent the government oversight was nill and the mainstream line of thought (perpetuated by government) connected the idea of the American dream to home ownership. \n\n\nAnd what are we seeing today? People are treating higher education as a human right. College is pushed in school in the media and by the government. Student Loans are handed out like candy and suffer from the same lack of oversight as real estate loans did in 08. \n\n\n2. The the thing that brought down the bubble in 08 was everyone's inability to pay. Giving mortgages to people who couldn't possibly pay it off even an adjustable's teaser rate, meams eventually they default and the bank forcloses and resells but eventually no one is buying. \n\n\nIts a common meme that people will be paying off their student loans for decades to come, much like a mortgage. Many complain about having an inability to pay about how taxes and lack of initial job opportunity means they will default. And student loans carry over even in bank ruptcy so its a debt that will stick with you. \n\n\n3. How it effects everyone. In 08 the reason why the nation reeled rather than just a slow down in the market was because now all of the bonds and securities that these mortgages backed were now worthless. Making the bonds and securities worthless. Meaning investment halts. Also the banks had a growing surplus of forclosed houses they could not sell which means they were not obtaining income to invest and loan out. \n\n\nAll loans are traded in some form or fashion. Its a reality of our economy. I haven't had the chance to look at what student loans may be used to back but even if the lenders just use them as collateral when getting loans, when they are defaulted on en mass they will be useless in whatever market they are in. \n\n\nUniversity costs will skyrocket students will default and drop out. \n\n\nIts more complicated than I layed out but I needed to articulate my concern in some way.

Libertarian belief is about securing the most liberties for the individual, if I'm not mistaken. \n\nIf we boil our society down to the idea that starting tomorrow, every individual is completely free in their behavior (not to mention mind, conscious, and association), that means that we are close to a state of nature. Though, not exactly, because everyone has already been influenced by society as it stood in time before the point of total Libertarian regime, so to speak. \n\nSo, if we get a total libertarian society in which we are all free to behave however we wish and all our liberties are guaranteed, would we make the same choices in regards to our associations, or even our behavior regarding the well-being of others? We essentially are dissolving the social contract and forgoing any sort of aggregate social utility in favor of total, unhinged liberty for all. In total Libertarianism, do we care at all for our neighbor? Or is it even laissez-faire in the way we conduct our associations? Hands-off, I don't bother you, you don't bother me sort of thing?\n\nLiberalism (the main focus of Rawls and his theory of justice) would take a more moderate approach to this. We have these ideas of social contracts and aggregate social utility essentially borrowed from other theories that we use to make our differing individual conceptions of life, politics, and culture compatible with one another in what he calls reasonable pluralism. In addition, Rawls restricts his theories to the mere political conception, or in other words the conception of the person as it relates to political rights and liberties.\n\nFull disclosure, I am not a Libertarian, and I do not claim to be an expert in the subject.

Problem there, is the fact that most people not only don't want to cooperate, they also don't want to be productive. \n\nIf you've worked in the venture capital investment scene like I have, have created investment groups, worked for investment groups, and had business partners. You know how nearly impossible it is just to get people to invest their time in making something successful, much less their money. \n\nBut that's the issue we face today. People who don't want to work, who don't want to be productive, who don't want to really do anything, are the ones demanding socialism and communism and arguing against property rights. I know this because at one time i was not only a liberal while in college, I was also someone who associated with communists and socialists. I met commies and socialists of many different stripes and ages. Owning my own carpet cleaning business, while selling insurance and annuities while going to college for 12 credits a semester was completely alien concept to them. And it was these scum bags who helped push me to the center of politics and the belief that welfare has been a blight on humanity. \n\nI tried to give these people jobs that paid quite well for their limited abilities. With someone working sixty hours a week and able to earn around $750-$1,000 depending on the week. In Florida this can mean owning a 1500 SQFT house in a safe neighborhood. It got to the point I had to make them assistants earning $10 an hour because of how infrequent they showed up for work. I paid them as independent contractors and I only paid them for eight hour days. If they couldn't get the work done in eight hours, then they needed to find a new job. \n\nRather than work together and create businesses and enterprises that embody their desires. Commies and socialists demand to be thieves that force other people to work for values far less than the free market will provide them, or worse yet, outright steal property from these people in seizing land, property, and businesses. Forget cancerous taxation, commies and socialists advocate outright seizure of that which they cannot achieve, cannot create, and even worse, cannot do anything productive with. \n\nLenin, Stalin, and Mao saw various issues of this where when they weren't mass murdering farmers and intentionally inflicting starvation, they had given land to people who could not farm or had no will to farm, and thus people starved. \n\nLife is a game not everyone can win, because many people choose not to play. Instead they make the choice to spend their tie on fruitless acts and ventures. And they become the loudest voices for demanding the villainous redistribution of wealth. Because they are to loathsome and lazy to create any wealth for themselves. They are a cancer and history has proven this time and time again. For even if there has never been any \"True Communism\" or \"True Socialism\" these scum pave the way for despots and murderers (i.e. Mao, Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, and that whacko in North Korea who'd rather starve his people than give up nuclear missile ambitions [no one wants the burden of your shitty country]). \n\nFree markets, truly free markets that prevent monopolizing of resources and markets allow for those willing to work and learn, to create enterprises that can benefit the whole of society.

They vote December 14th. But if Congress gets enough calls, *they* can stop the FDC.\n\n**What is delivery neutrality? Why does it matter?**\n\nDelivery neutrality is the principle that delivery providers like FedEx &amp; UPS should not control what we order and ship. In 2015, boutiques, delivery freedom groups, and 3.7 million commenters won strong delivery neutrality rules from the US Federal Delivery Commission (FDC). The rules prohibit delivery providers from blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization\u2014\"fast lanes\" for stores that pay, and slow lanes for everyone else.\n\n**We are Team Community. We support delivery neutrality, freedom of shipping.**\n\nNearly everyone who understands and depends on delivery supports delivery neutrality, whether they're boutique owners, makers, hobbyists, marketers, distributors, writers, journalists, or typical shoppers who just want their delivery to work as advertised\u2014regardless of their political party. But don't take our word for it. Ask your neighbor.\n\n**They are Team Corporation. They want to end delivery neutrality, to control &amp; tax the world.**\n\nDelivery companies are famous for high prices and poor service. Several rank as the most hated companies in America. Now, they're lobbying the FDC and Congress to end delivery neutrality. Why? It's simple: if they win the power to slow delivery down, they can bully any store into paying millions to escape the \"slow lane.\" This would amount to a tax on every sector of the American economy. Every store would cost more, since they'd all have to pay big delivery. Worse, it would extinguish boutiques and independent journals who can't afford to pay. If we lose delivery neutrality, the world will never be the same.\n\n**Extra Reading**\n\nHere are some excellent articles for additional depth. They cover the issue, its political history, the struggles we've overcome, and the fight ahead in Congress and at the FDC.\n\n- [Amazon May Have Found a Major Delivery Neutrality Loophole to Provide Free Shipping](https://www.battleforthenet.com)\n\n- [UPS will now pick up your old electronics for free](https://www.battleforthenet.com)\n\n- [UberEATS partners with McDonald's](https://www.battleforthenet.com)\n\n- [DHL's new restrictions regarding drugs and live animals](https://www.battleforthenet.com)\n\n- [USPS Will No Longer Deliver Wine Across Borders](https://www.battleforthenet.com)\n\n- [Save on shipping by opting for branded packaging](https://www.battleforthenet.com)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Delivery Neutrality"}

The public and actual positions of T_D mods aren't lining up when it comes to Net Neutrality.\n\nSome ISPs behave badly because [they are granted artificial monopolies by local governments,](https://arstechnica.com/business/2014/04/one-big-reason-we-lack-internet-competition-starting-an-isp-is-really-hard/) so they have little competition. To hold ISPs accountable, we should stop allowing governments to seize property with eminent domain, and then lease it out to their favorite corporations. \n\nThere are two steps to stopping these government granted monopolies:\n\n1. Stop or reduce the use of eminent domain, which often redistributes property from private owners to privileged corporations. (Especially corporations which support authoritarian leftist politicians...)\n\n2. Allow *any* private entity to run wires on existing publicly managed utility poles. For example, [allow Google Fiber actually run its lines on thousands of utility poles to start its competing service in Nashville.](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/09/google-fiber-says-it-hasnt-gotten-access-to-44000-poles-in-nashville/)\n\nNet Neutrality is not a solution. Net Neutrality is just adding in more federal rules and regulations, which blocks competition, and will only make the existing monopolies stronger. It's a wolf in sheep's clothing. Giving government more control over the internet is a huge win for big corporations, a blow against the free speech and innovation which grew the internet in the first place, and will ultimately damage smaller businesses and startups which can't afford the cost of compliance and reporting for lengthy federal regulations.\n\nhttps://mises.org/library/myth-natural-monopoly\n\nhttps://fee.org/articles/net-neutrality-or-government-brutality/\n\nhttps://reason.com/archives/2015/04/09/the-net-neutrality-riddle\n\nhttps://mises.org/library/net-neutrality-scam\n\nhttp://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/25/net-neutrality-is-a-problem-not-a-solution/\n\nhttp://www.cato.org/blog/net-neutrality-or-destroying-internet-innovation-investment","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"An Argument Against Net Neutrality"}

{"author":"RV2115","created_utc":1511331754,"num_comments":15,"score":0,"selftext":"I want to put forth my thinking, please feel free to tear into it: \n\n           I separate the economy into two \"sides\", for lack of a better word. On one side, you have businesses, and on the other the consumer. \n            A business' first and most important goal is to make profit. This is no surprise to anyone. While they may also focus on many awesome and heartwarming things at times, they are after the money. \n            A consumer's goal on the other hand, can be wildly varied and hard to generalize, often however, a consumer wants something easy, cheap, and fast, while also being of adequate quality, functionality, and durability. \n\n\nSo, what does this mean? Why am I bringing it up? \n\n            Here again, we run into an issue. In order for me to continue I must separate the argument for a free market into two large and often shared ideas. \n            The first idea is simple. A free market simply is more effective and efficient at serving the consumer, it's able to advance and to adapt faster to market forces, etc. In short, it's a better economic system. \n            The second idea is also pretty simple. A free market is a better moral choice because it respects the rights of people and their property. \n\n\nFirst, I will argue against the first idea. \n\n         A free market would not be a good choice because of the goals of the consumers and businesses. Society likes simplicity, ease-of-use, and prettiness. I am not referring to their shopping taste, rather how they like their economy. A free market requires a high participation level on the part of the consumer. No longer is the government there to regulate what most people live their entire lives knowing nothing about. I think a large percentage of the consumers would simply get tired and frustrated with the micromanaging of the business world.\n          However, some of you might be saying, \"Well, the consumers could pay a company that gives their seal of approval to items that pass the desires set by the consumer. That way, the free market creates its own regulatory system akin to the FDA and such.\" But, there are still flaws in that. The first issue with that would be that there would sprout many of these FDA-like businesses, which each would have their own specific set of rules to get their own specific seal of approval. There would be over-saturation. One pack of meat with 28 stickers from 28 different companies that have endorsed the product. And let's not forget, the FDA knock off is still a business, it needs to make money, and perhaps it may choose to partner up with a certain brand, and refuse to endorse others. Sure, you might say \"A company that behaves like that won't have the support of the consumer. Their bad practices will lead to their downfall\". While I agree that some things, like food and houses will have very good and honest business giving their seal of approval due to immense consumer pressure, you have to remember there are thousands of categories of things. Will each have a regulatory business heading out seals of approval? If so, it will be too much for the average consumer. Consumers don't want to have to check everything they buy, look into all the businesses. This idea translates to almost everything else. The safety of the houses, food, roads, cars, the quality of chairs, beds, windows, steel,  the reliability of fire extinguishers, brakes, TV's, etc. Many things are regulated by the government that I can't picture the consumers regulating. The economy, technology, and society is simply too large and advanced for a free market to be safe, effective at producing what the consumer wants at the quality they want, and to self-regulate. \n\nNow, to argue the second point. The free market is morally superior. \n\n           I am of the mindset that objectively, rights do not exist, there is no such thing in reality. We simply create rights so that we can be treated how we want to be. We don't want stuff we worked for taken from us, so we agree that you have the right to the house you build, etc.  ( if you believe in a higher power or order to the universe, and that is where you get your morality and idea of rights from, this argument will be irrelevant to you ) Now, if we agree that we create rights to have a more fair, ordered, and peaceful society, we can move on. \n           Now, I do have an idea similar to rights, but I call them privileges. If it was a right, it can't be taken away. For example, if you think owning a gun is a right, you should think that a person should be able to own a gun even if they have multiple felonies in their record, because rights are intrinsic to being a human. I call them privileges so that I may, without defeating my own logic, take them away. You can't shout \"fire\" in a crowded theater, you can't own a gun if you have committed murder before, you can't protest in the middle of the street, etc. \n          So, moving on, what is morally good and what is evil? Is regulating a business evil? Is it immoral to tell a business what it can and can't do, and force it to meet certain requirements? Well, my view is if it helps more people than it hurts, if it makes more people happy than it makes sad, then it is good.\n         Given that, if government regulation allows the people of a country to feel safer, to be happier, without having to worry about businesses, then I say regulation is good. \n\n            ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why I was, but am no longer, a libertarian."}

I am a republican because I am a strong supporter of the 2nd amendment, oppose the tyranny of the deep state and wealthy elite, oppose hierarchy, oppose the establishment politicians, hate the federal government, and oppose democrat hate groups like neo nazis, KKK, etc. I am a communist because I want America to be a place where everyone has equal rights, is free from the tyranny of the deep state and wealthy elites like Soros, oppose hierarchy, support the 2nd amendment, and am against the establishment. I am not afraid to question the federal government, and I watch infowars by Alex Jones, as he tells it like it is and isnt Soros-funded.\n\nHow we want America to be run\n\nCommunist republicans want a nation that does not have any bourgeois influence, a nation free of fake news, and destruction of the libtard democrat ideology and political correctness. These are the laws in place that will ensure we have a communist republican nation. \n\n\nThe government has no right to regulate guns in any way whatsoever, and if someone tries to confiscate your guns, you can shoot on sight.\nWe cannot have any bourgeois influence. If someone is caught with money, GULAG!!!!!! \nEveryone must pray to god emperor Trump and Stalin 3 times a day. Anyone who fails to comply with this is a democrat, and will be sent to gulag. \nWe cannot have any libtard democrats in this country. To enforce this law, anyone that voted democrat in the last 50 years will be sent to gulag. \nIf someone is caught talking shit about god emperor Trump or Republicans, supporting capitalism, or wearing blue, GULAG!!!!!!\nAll fake news (anything other than fox, breitbart, Infowars, and flat earth society) must be abolished, and all viewers and reporters of fake news must be sent to gulag.\nSupporters of democrat, anti American groups like neo nazis, ISIS, KKK, etc must be sent to gulag.\nAnyone who is a globehead or promotes the spinning globe propaganda must be sent to gulag. \n\n\n\nHow we will rise to power\n\nWe are going to infiltrate the bourgeois. That means pretending to hold political views that are generally supported by the public, such as pretending to be a libtard democrat that hates Trump in a blue state like MA, CA, or NY.\n\nThis is going to be my fake persona to infiltrate the bourgeois in a libtard environment,\n\n-I will pretend to Support Hillary Clinton, and blame her loss on the Russians and bigotry\n-Be mostly anti gun\n-When asked why I hate Trump, dont bring up his policies, instead resort to the typical libtard response. This is calling Trump a white supremacist, comparing him to nazis and Hitler, calling him a fascist, calling him a loose cannon, and calling him a sexist while bringing up the \u201cgrab them by the pussy\u201d video. While spouting this bullshit, bring up impeachment\nSupport regulated capitalism, while calling republicans \u201ccrony capitalists\u201d and start going on about monopolies and how it stifles innovation.\n-Don\u2019t be overly radical, as this will cause people to suspect that I am not stating my real views (advocating for violence, SJW rhetoric, etc)\n-When arguing with republicans, conservatives, or libertarians, argue respectfully, make a few decent points, but don\u2019t be too convincing as we need to keep up the persona of \u201clibtard that doesn\u2019t really understand economics or politics that well\u201d.\n-Reject all of what libtards call \u201cfake news and or conspiracy theories\u201d (except for the russia one and possibly the Trump hiring russian hookers one). This includes calling Alex Jones a \u201ctinfoil hat nutjob\u201d, flat earth \u201c14th century bullshit\u201d, and say that the holohoax happened and should never be questioned.\n-Bring up the Trump discrimination case and talk about how Trump refused to rent to black people in the 80\u2019s\n-Support legalization of marijuana and \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d abortions. (Pretend to be pro choice, even though we are actually pro abortion)\nCall Ovomit \u201cone of the best presidents we ever had\u201d\n-Make anti communism statements that democrats would make (communism killed millions, communism works in theory not in practice, etc)\n\nThis is how I will get my political career started. I will start by running for mayor of my city, and then work my way up to President, where I will then surround myself with other communist republicans (there are several of us), and I will abolish the constitution and eventually become a dictator that rules America with an iron fist (dictatorship is good if the right people are in power, like Trump, Putin, or Stalin).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"My communist republican manifesto"}

I think that the free market is probably the best solution to internet access. However, I do think of access to the internet as a utility. In my opinion, disallowing a person internet access (in any developed country) is almost as bad as disallowing them access to food. \n\nSo, my understanding.\n\n- Without NN, ISP's can charge you (or make you watch adds) in order to get to specific websites. Or they can flat out refuse to connect you to a website at all. This has huge implications for the freedom of information, and the ability of the public to educate themselves. I don't want an internet where all the info available to me is pro my ISP, that's incredibly dangerous. I also don't want an internet where everything I care about is behind a pay wall.\n\n- A repeal of NN would deregulate the ISP's, allowing for small ISP's to compete with the big ones. Right now we have monopolies (or duopolies) that stifle competition, and allows ISP's to artificially increase prices. What regulations would we be removing by repealing NN? Could we 'deregulate' to allow competition while still protecting the freedom of information?\n\n- A repeal of NN would allow ISP's to sell internet access in packages. So for example, you could buy the 'reddit, imgur, facebook, twitter' package, and you would only have access to those sites. Further, you could buy several packages (or maybe pay for access to each individual site). In a free market this seems like a good idea. I always thought it was dumb that I had to pay for a cable package that includes 200 sports channels when I'm never going to watch any of them. If I could literally select each channel I want to be able to watch, and only pay for those channels, that would be Ideal for me. The same idea applies to the internet. Unfortunately, this only works in a truly free market (which we definitely don't have right now). Further, it's fairly obvious how this power would be abused by ISP's. I think of internet access as a utility. If you only have access to 1 news website, I wonder what you are going to think about politics. If you only have access to 1 ride sharing app, I wonder which one will get your business.\n\nI guess I'm just conflicted. I think the free market is incredibly powerful, but I'm also terrified of what unregulated ISP's could do. Thoughts?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Genuine confusion on Net Neutrality"}

It's very disheartening, and I'm truly quite shocked by what I'm seeing. \n\nToo many people have been duped by insane amounts of dishonest propaganda, half-truths, word games, and muddying the conceptual waters into supporting this nonsense. *Technical concepts* which have according *technical definitions*, like 'broadband' are being redefined for ideological and weasely reasons in order to make sweeping claims that don't reflect the actual situation, to make things seem much worse than they are. Proponents, either as a dishonest ideological vanguard or as 'useful idiots', equate 'net neutrality', which has been a bottom-up market norm, with 'net neutrality *regulation*', which is a top-down imposition, and distract people by muddying terms like 'rules', which had no teeth nor legal enforceability, to be implied dishonestly as the same thing as laws and regulations. \n\nPeople are just not thinking critically. \n\nFACT: The structure of law is being returned to what it was to pre-2015 levels, which was sans Net Neutrality Regulation, instituted under Clinton, with a bipartisan congress, *to keep government hands off of the internet*. That regulatory environment has led exactly to the wonder and innovation of the internet you see, use, and enjoy today, and the amazing socioeconomic effects that have rippled outwards throughout all aspects of our lives. \n\nIf you want to complain about something, complain about municipal/state mandated monopolies for ISPs -- but mandating Net Neutrality Regulation doesn't relieve these problems. It only adds new ones, and shifts others around. We don't solve problems created by government  by giving the government even more power. To any extent the expansion of broadband internet infrastructure around the US has been retarded by the current ISP market, it will only be hindered even moreso, especially with smaller or entrepreneurial ISPs, due to NNR. The fact that investment in broadband infrastructure was *down* 5.6% under NNR, the only time this has ever happened while not in an economic crises, illustrates this. \n\nWe all know how once you 'give' (read: allow to take) government some authority into its hands, even lightly, it will become a grip that never wants to let go, and desperately wants to tighten over time. If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And when it stops moving, subsidize it. The internet, especially, referred to by Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google as, \"the largest experiment in anarchy we've ever had.\" absolutely *must* be kept away from the hands of the state, and not just for such valuable economic reasons, neither. It's just too important for freedom overall -- of speech, of thought, of information, of communication, to give the state increased authority over. \n\nAnd speaking of Google -- 'big content' (Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Yahoo, et al) is not some 'principled' 'freedom advocate' over this. They're not looking out for your interests. It's just special interests of big content vs ISPs. Their heavy lobbying for NNR is, by definition, rent seeking behavior, and while the biggest ISPs are indeed rent-seekers as well (since some of them in many local/state areas are mandated monopolies), adding another set of rent seekers will make these problems worse, not better. Big content, taking advantage of the political climate surrounding ISPs, wants to externalize the costs of their bandwidth hogging, shifting it from them and their customers, onto ISPs and their customers, muddying who is directly responsible for what consumption, shielding them from backlash, and dislocating a proper (and 'free' as in freedom) economic structure of tying use to its direct costs. \n\nAnd further, speaking of content in general -- you want *the FCC, of all entities*, the same department that regulates and punishes individuals and companies for nipple slips and scary swear words, to begin regulating aspects of... the internet? This is *the internet*, we're talking about, people. I realize that NNR, as it stands, isn't explicitly for this purpose -- but the regulation does touch on aspects of how 'content' is handled, and grants the FCC vs FTC authority in this area, so please try to remember the cancer of government intervention and regulation, as noted earlier. \n\nThen there are the claims of 'what' 'could' happen without Net Neutrality Regulation. These things 'could' have always happened, pre-2015, and there is exceedingly thin evidence that they did. In extraordinarily rare situations that approached these worries, the market handled it, without government intervention, and the market norms reflect this that they didn't turn into an ongoing problem for the industry. Who woulda thunk it, the market works, as imperfect as it is. \n\nSo we can move either towards Brazil's internet (which has long had NNR), with relatively miserable performance and even worse infrastructure, or we can move towards Hong Kong's -- much closer to the free market ideal of ISPs that we claim we support and want. The Net Neutrality Regulation instituted by Wheeler's FCC in 2015 should have never been implemented in the first place, and it absolutely must be repealed.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"It's very disheartening seeing so much of /r/Libertarian duped by dishonest NNR propaganda."}

Centered on the belief (termed invisible hand by the 18th century Scottish economist Adam Smith) that human beings are naturally motivated by self-interest and, when they are not interfered-with in their economic activities, a balanced system of production and exchange based on mutual benefit emerges. Laissez-faire (French for, allow to pass or let go) economics originated in the 18th century France where economists (then called 'physiocrats') such as Francois Quesnay (1694-1774) and Victor Riqueti-Marquis de Mirabeau (1715-89) became hostile to subsidies and discriminatory economic measures of then prevalent mercantilism.\n\nThey believed in a bountiful nature and innate goodness of humankind, and asserted that governments should leave the individual alone except when social liberties are infringed. In 19th century, this philosophy became the dominant economic thinking in the Western world. But soon its failings reflected in the great disparity in distribution of wealth, harsh treatment of workers, disregard for consumer safety, and spread of monopolies, became clear. By the mid 19th century, opposition to laissez-faire economics began and governments in all industrialized countries intervened on behalf of workers and general population. Factory laws and consumer protection laws were enacted and growth of monopolies was checked. Early 20th century saw breakup of monopolies in the US and (after Second World War) nationalization of essential industries and services in Europe. Keynesian economics (which advocates government intervention in the national economy) further undermined it, a process spurred by the great depression of 1930s.\"\n\nhttp://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/laissez-faire-economics.html\n\n\"The philosophy\u2019s popularity reached its peak around 1870. In the late 19th century the acute changes caused by industrial growth and the adoption of mass-production techniques proved the laissez-faire doctrine insufficient as a guiding philosophy. Although the original concept yielded to new theories that attracted wider support, the general philosophy still has its advocates.\"\nThe philosophy\u2019s popularity reached its peak around 1870.

As an experiment in 1774, Turgot, Louis XVI's Controller-General of Finances, abolished all restraints on the heavily controlled grain industry, allowing imports and exports to operate as a free trade system. But when poor harvests caused scarcities, prices shot through the roof; merchants ended up hoarding supplies or selling grain in strategic areas, even outside the country for better profit, while thousands of French citizens starved. Riots ensued for several months. In the middle of 1775, order was restored \u2013 and with it, government controls over the grain market.\"\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laissezfaire.asp\n\nIts future doesn't look bright.

Rolling back regulatory policy to the state of the world circa 2015 is not an apocalyptic, extinction-level event. Regardless of whether you're 'for' or 'against' net neutrality, the outrage is completely unjustified.\n\nPassion and outrage is not the friend of liberty. Calm, cool reason is.\n\n\n2/ Local monopolies are an issue. Obviously. But the libertarian perspective is to get government *out* of the business of creating and protecting these monopolies. The statist perspective is to double down with more government to solve the problems the government created. In other words, get sober by taking another drink.\n\nAs Friedman used to say: \"Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.\"\n\n\n3/ The regulatory apparatus created by Net Neutrality regulations is identical to that of Obamacare. Just like Obamacare has rules for what health insurance must cover, Net Neutrality has rules for what ISPs must cover (answer: everything at the same price regardless of the underlying cost). \n\nIt's a fact that some types of data are significantly cheaper to serve per GB than other types of data. For example, large static data like movies on Netflix are served out of CDNs usually very close to where you live. Amazon charges $0.08/GB out of its data centers, but only $0.02/GB out of its CDNs (75% less!).\n\nJust like Obamacare lumps people together into \"risk pools\" to make the healthy young people pay for older sick people, Net Neutrality does the same for heavy and light users of the internet.\n\nMore concretely: Net Neutrality lumps vocal, active, techies that consume tons of data (e.g. people like us) into the same \"risk pool\" as people who are less vocal and consume less data (e.g. Grandma).\n\nPeople like Grandma don't have lobbying groups or influence at the FCC. Their voice gets lost and their interests overlooked.\n\nExample: Instead of allowing Grandma to pay $5 to an ISP for a plan that only allows e-mail and social media, her only option is paying $60 for a full-featured plan she doesn't want to subsidize your Netflix binge watching and porn addiction.\n\nThere are real market opportunities like this (particularly for smaller ISPs who can offer cheap niche products) that can't be realized if a) the FCC has Net Neutrality rules, or b) the FCC signals it's willingness to micromanage the market when it arbitrarily decides it's unhappy.\n\n\n4/ Consumer technology companies (e.g. Facebook, Google, Netflix, etc) like Net Neutrality. They like the idea of their most active users being able to consume heavy data from them at lower costs (to them). They don't care that Grandma, who rarely uses their products, is subsidizing all this.\n\n\n\nTLDR:\n\nNet Neutrality is an affront to freedom and liberty. It's regulatory scheme is filled with perverse incentives that takes costs incurred by vocal interest groups and spreads them around to others who are less vocal.\n\nDon't make Grandma pay for your porn addiction.\n\nOppose Net Neutrality.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Net Neutrality Explained: Obamacare for the Internet"}

It's very disheartening, and I'm truly quite shocked by what I'm seeing. \n\nToo many people have been duped by insane amounts of dishonest propaganda, half-truths, word games, and muddying the conceptual waters into supporting this nonsense. *Technical concepts* which have according *technical definitions*, like 'broadband' are being redefined for ideological and weasely reasons in order to make sweeping claims that don't reflect the actual situation, to make things seem much worse than they are. Proponents, either as a dishonest ideological vanguard or as 'useful idiots', equate 'net neutrality', which has been a bottom-up market norm, with 'net neutrality *regulation*', which is a top-down imposition, and distract people by muddying terms like 'rules', which had no teeth nor legal enforceability, to be implied dishonestly as the same thing as laws and regulations. \n\nPeople are just not thinking critically. \n\nFACT: The structure of law is being returned to what it was to pre-2015 levels, which was sans Net Neutrality Regulation, instituted under Clinton, with a bipartisan congress, *to keep government hands off of the internet*. That regulatory environment has led exactly to the wonder and innovation of the internet you see, use, and enjoy today, and the amazing socioeconomic effects that have rippled outwards throughout all aspects of our lives. \n\nIf you want to complain about something, complain about municipal/state mandated monopolies for ISPs -- but mandating Net Neutrality Regulation doesn't relieve these problems. It only adds new ones, and shifts others around. We don't solve problems created by government  by giving the government even more power. To any extent the expansion of broadband internet infrastructure around the US has been retarded by the current ISP market, it will only be hindered even moreso, especially with smaller or entrepreneurial ISPs, due to NNR. The fact that investment in broadband infrastructure was *down* 5.6% under NNR, the only time this has ever happened while not in an economic crises, illustrates this. \n\nWe all know how once you 'give' (read: allow to take) government some authority into its hands, even lightly, it will become a grip that never wants to let go, and desperately wants to tighten over time. If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And when it stops moving, subsidize it. The internet, especially, referred to by Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google as, \"the largest experiment in anarchy we've ever had.\" absolutely *must* be kept away from the hands of the state, and not just for such valuable economic reasons, neither. It's just too important for freedom overall -- of speech, of thought, of information, of communication, to give the state increased authority over. \n\nAnd speaking of Google -- 'big content' (Google, Microsoft, Netflix, Yahoo, et al) is not some 'principled' 'freedom advocate' over this. They're not looking out for your interests. It's just special interests of big content vs ISPs. Their heavy lobbying for NNR is, by definition, rent seeking behavior, and while the biggest ISPs are indeed rent-seekers as well (since some of them in many local/state areas are mandated monopolies), adding another set of rent seekers will make these problems worse, not better. Big content, taking advantage of the political climate surrounding ISPs, wants to externalize the costs of their bandwidth hogging, shifting it from them and their customers, onto ISPs and their customers, muddying who is directly responsible for what consumption, shielding them from backlash, and dislocating a proper (and 'free' as in freedom) economic structure of tying use to its direct costs. \n\nAnd further, speaking of content in general -- you want *the FCC, of all entities*, the same department that regulates and punishes individuals and companies for nipple slips and scary swear words, to begin regulating aspects of... the internet? This is *the internet*, we're talking about, people. I realize that NNR, as it stands, isn't explicitly for this purpose -- but the regulation does touch on aspects of how 'content' is handled, and grants the FCC vs FTC authority in this area, so please try to remember the cancer of government intervention and regulation, as noted earlier. \n\nThen there are the claims of 'what' 'could' happen without Net Neutrality Regulation. These things 'could' have always happened, pre-2015, and there is exceedingly thin evidence that they did. In extraordinarily rare situations that approached these worries, the market handled it, without government intervention, and the market norms reflect this that they didn't turn into an ongoing problem for the industry. Who woulda thunk it, the market works, as imperfect as it is. \n\nSo we can move either towards Brazil's internet (which has long had NNR), with relatively miserable performance and even worse infrastructure, or we can move towards Hong Kong's -- much closer to the free market ideal of ISPs that we claim we support and want. The Net Neutrality Regulation instituted by Wheeler's FCC in 2015 should have never been implemented in the first place, and it absolutely must be repealed.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"It's very disheartening seeing so much of /r/Libertarian duped by dishonest NNR propaganda.""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"netneutrality","title":"It's very disheartening seeing so many duped by dishonest NNR propaganda."}

It was posted by a Californian Congress Rep as an example of what might happen if Net Neutrality got removed. It's supposed to show that you have to pay those prices to access these services. This is a lie.\n\nThe way any data plan here (and anywhere, I imagine) works is, you have a global data capa after which you either can't use any more data or you start paying more. There's a limit, but it's for all data, regardless of which service it comes from. What this image shows is the option to pay an extra to have the data for those services not get counted for the global data cap, or to have a much higher cap. You're not paying to access Snapchat because you can do that anyway, you're paying to be able to access Snapchat as much as you want. This is only possible because of lack of Net Neutrality and it is fundamentally a good thing - you, the consumer, has more options. If 3/4 of your data comes from Snapchat, maybe this is a solid idea. It is discrimination, but positive: nothing is being hidden behind a paywall, instead you're given better access if you're willing to pay more.\n\n[This article](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/22/16691506/portugal-meo-internet-packages-net-neutrality-ajit-pai-plan) explains my point fairly well.\n\nThere are some good arguments in favor of net neutrality (censorship comes to mind). This isn't one, and the only idea it makes sense to you is if you do not even, understand the language it's written in. It's intellectually dishonest, you're not showing an actual example of a negative consequence of the lack of NN, instead you're playing on your audience's communication barrier.\n\nWhat's aggravating to me is that we have better Internet than most Americans, almost anywhere in Lisbon you can have optic fiber internet at around 50\u20ac/month and you can always choose from 2 ISP's, but we keep being presented as this poster child for the horrors of removing Net Neutrality.\n\nEdit: In case you're going to post on how you hate data caps, I get it, but that doesnt really have anything to do with my post or net neutrality.

Firstly, this is all from Wikipedia. Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm not some Alinsky scholar and this is just a casual observation. I was looking up Alinsky because T_D likes to scapegoat him, especially when it comes to Hillary and Soros. But I don't think many of them have actually read anything he's said or know much about him...shocker! Check it out: \n\n&gt;Alinsky described his plans for 1972 to begin to organize the white middle-class across the United States, and the necessity of that project. He believed that many Americans were living in frustration and despair, worried about their future, and ripe for a turn to radical social change, to become politically active citizens. He feared the middle class could be driven to a right-wing viewpoint, \"making them ripe for the plucking by some guy on horseback promising a return to the vanished verities of yesterday\".[4] His stated motive: \"I love this goddamn country, and we're going to take it back.\"\n\nIs that not, verbatim, what Trump did? Fucking hilarious! Trump took a page right out of the Saul Alinksky playbook! That's fucking funny! Is MAGA's origin really Saul Alinsky?! HA!\n\nAnd then there's this: \n\n&gt;Alinsky did not join political parties. When asked during an interview whether he ever considered becoming a Communist Party member, he replied:\n\n&gt;Not at any time. I've never joined any organization\u2014not even the ones I've organized myself. I prize my own independence too much. And philosophically, I could never accept any rigid dogma or ideology, whether it's Christianity or Marxism. One of the most important things in life is what Judge Learned Hand described as \"that ever-gnawing inner doubt as to whether you're right.\" If you don't have that, if you think you've got an inside track to absolute truth, you become doctrinaire, humorless and intellectually constipated. The greatest crimes in history have been perpetrated by such religious and political and racial fanatics, from the persecutions of the Inquisition on down to Communist purges and Nazi genocide.[4]\n\nSound familiar? Prizing one's own independence? Not buying into extremist dogma? Equating Nazis and Commies ideologies as fanatical. Citing the evolution of becoming indoctrinated and humorless (that's huge right now!) and most important: intellectually constipated. All of these things sound to me why most sensible libertarians hate both the right and the left, especially now. If I didn't know better I'd say old Saul is a closet libertarian. Which again, is freaking hilarious considered how he's demonized by the right and worshiped on the left. \n\n&gt;In Rules for Radicals, he notes that this tactic fell under two of his rules: Rule #3: Wherever possible, go outside the experience of the enemy; and Rule #4: Ridicule is man's most potent weapon.\n\nLet that sink in. Ridicule is man's most potent weapon...and consider that Trump won his election with one main weapon: ridicule. Also consider that ridicule is the weapon of choice online now. Please clap. \n\n&gt;Alinsky's tactics were often unorthodox. In Rules for Radicals he wrote: The job of the organizer is to maneuver and bait the establishment so that it will publicly attack him as a 'dangerous enemy.' [According to Alinsky], the hysterical instant reaction of the establishment [will] not only validate [the organizer's] credentials of competency but also ensure automatic popular invitation.[14]\n\nAgain, let that sink in...bait the establishment so that it will publicly attack him as a dangerous enemy...The hysterical instant reaction of the establishment will validate...sound familiar?! Hello Twitter. Hello media. This is Trump 101. Again, hilarious to me, considering the source. \n\nYes, yes, I know Alinsky wrote his book for the have-nots to take away power from the haves. But the era he wrote it in matters - context is everything!\n\nTL:DR\n\nSaul Alinsky might be a closet libertarian and I think Trump read his book and used it.

{"author":"LTJ98","created_utc":1511790221,"num_comments":5,"score":0,"selftext":"Recently I've been thinking about how I would summarize libertarian philosophy to a newcomer. Here is my attempt.\n\nLibertarianism is the pursuit of limiting the use of force in society. Libertarian philosophy holds that government action is done through the use of coercive force and is therefore immoral.\n\nWe believe that the government gets its rights from the people, aka, the people delegate their rights to a collective body. This means that the government can only have as much power as the individual. For example, as we have a right to our life, we can delegate protection of that right to a collective body, in this case it would be the government.\n\nAs government is a collection of individuals it must be held to the same moral standards as individuals. Anything that is immoral for an individual to do must also be immoral for a group to do. Stealing is wrong for an individual, so it doesn't magically become acceptable when it is justified by a collective. \n\nMost Libertarians believe that rights are inherent to humans, stemming from the concept of self ownership. Government is merely a tool to protect those rights. Self ownership necessitates that people must have the freedom to own the results of their actions, whether those are good or bad. This is the foundation for property rights. Libertarians believe in negative rights. Negative rights basically means that someone cannot stop you from doing something with force. E.g. the right to life means that someone cannot take your life, the right to property means that someone cannot impose restrictions on you making voluntary transactions, with force. \n\nLibertarians believe that an individuals rights where another persons begins, this means that positive rights are not legitimate as they require involuntary action which infringes on another individuals rights. A positive right to water would violate other peoples rights as they would be force to provide you with water. A negative right would just mean that the government or individuals cannot use force to stop you buying, or using un-owned water sources. \n\nCrits plz.

In some places, people literally only have one option for who they choose as their ISP.\n\nMeanwhile, since it's inception, all packets of data on the internet have been viewed and treated as equal, allowing for free flow of ideas and communication. Some ISPs were infringing on that privelage in 2013-2015 and so the principle of net neutrality was codified by the FCC, ensuring all data packets would be treated equal, preserving the free exchange of ideas on a publicly funded service.\n\nThe only argument I see that is for repealing Net Neutrality is that it's regulation and regulation inherently impedes the free market. Which market is supposedly being impaired in this scenario?

Shouldn't be better to have the choice of deciding if I want to help poor people? or to pay for somebody else health?\n\nAt this point I'm arguing about how lucky he is about having a family that support him and that not everybody had the same circumstances as him.

It started out with these four random toll booth violations I got in the mail.  The thing is, these aren't my cars.  So, what do I do?  I call the number on the letter - wait on hold while at work for probably 3 hours because you know if it's before 8 or after 5 they're not even going to let you wait on hold.  Finally get someone on the phone and I explain the situation.  Okay great!  It seems to be resolved, I just need to scan these letter and my car title.  No big deal, I think - yeah it sucks I have to prove my innocence but this is pretty simple.  The lady give me the email address to her supervisor who is a sub contractor through then Xerox now Conduent and I send all the information to her.  Great I can move on....\n\nNope!  Maybe 2-3 months later I get another notice that I still owe, well what the heck I think.  Maybe I'll call again and see what's going on.  Speak to a lady who says I should just email to that same thread so I do.  Time goes on and nothing.  I think well shit, I've put in way too much effort and I haven't heard back - maybe it's resolved (maybe I'm stupid here).  Oh, and I've made multiple call attempts at this point before giving up.\n\nNothing goes on.  \n\nThis past weekend (over a year later) I get a letter from a debt collector... great.... Anyways, I call them explain what's going on and they give me a number to  my state's central collection unit.  I call them and explain, they say I have to call the toll booth company and if this isn't resolved, they're going to hold my tax return this year.  Well fuck, that can't happen I have a kid, Christmas coming up, I'm looking to buy a house, oh hell no.  So the toll booth company who only takes calls also from 8-5.  I call today now and after waiting on hold I am told to resend that thread of emails to the same exact person and request confirmation she got it.  So I do that, sent 2-3 emails asking her just to respond that she got them -nope. I call again this afternoon to see if she got it.  Welp, the rep then told me she can't come to the phone and those documents I describes won't work, I need to request a vehicle abstract from my MVA and send that (I'm so polite to these people but right now I'm thinking fuck you).  So I say, okay I'll get right on that thank you for the heads up and she apologizes for the previous people misinforming me.   Oh and I request the supervisor to call me back just to stay ahead of the game.  So I call the MVA and get through in maybe 15 minutes (WA FUCKING WHOO!!)  after speaking with a kind woman, she explains the MVA has no such document and that those documents I sent earlier should suffice.  Then, I call the toll company to explain they're making up documents (said this differently) and the woman was like well you're just going to have to wait for my supervisor to call you in 48 hours  as she can't and doesn't even know what to do.  So i now hang up and wait for this woman who has been MI fucking A for 2 years to call me?  \n\nI know I'm missing a lot especially from early on in this situation but damn I am starting to get upset with this.  I've filed a complaint with DOT OIG and I've been emailing a lawyer.  \n\nEnd rant - I welcome discussion \n\nPS: Anytime I have to call, I at least wait 20 minutes on the phone before getting to speak with someone but typically the wait is probably 40 minutes.   \n\nTL;DR: Toll booth fraud seems to be a thing and the government don't care\n\nEDIT: words are hard","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I'm about to take them on!"}

{"author":"98cwitr","created_utc":1511874618,"num_comments":16,"score":0,"selftext":"EIGHT WAYS BY Dick Lamm \n\n1. Turn it into a Bi-lingual or multi-lingual country. History shows that no country can survive this tension. Scholar Seymour Lipset said, \u201cThe histories of bilingual and bi-cultural societies that do not assimilate are histories of turmoil, tension, and tragedy.\u201d Canada, Begium, Malaysia, and Lebanon all face crises of national existence in which minorities press for autonomy, if not independence. Pakistan and Cyprus have divided. Nigeria suppressed and ethnic rebellion. France faces difficulties with Basques, Bretons, Corsicans and Muslims.\n\n2. Invent Mult-culturalism, encourage immigrants to maintain their culture. Make it an article of belief that all cultures are equal; that there are no cultural differences. Make it an article of faith that the Black and Hispanic dropout rates are due solely to prejudice and discrimination by the majority. Every other explanation is out of bounds.\n\n3. The key is to celebrate diversity rather than unity. As Benjamin Schwarz said in the Atlantic Monthly recently: 'The apparent success of our own multi-ethnic and multicultural experiment might have been achieved not by tolerance but by hegemony. Without the dominance that once dictated ethnocentricy and what it meant to be an American, we are left with only tolerance and pluralism to hold us together.' Lamm said, 'I would encourage all immigrants to keep their own language and culture. I would replace the melting pot metaphor with the salad bowl metaphor. It is important to ensure that we have various cultural subgroups living in America enforcing their differences rather than as Americans, emphasizing their similarities.'\n\n4. I would make our fastest growing demographic group the least educated. I would add a second underclass, un-assimilated, under-educated, and antagonistic to our population. I would have this second underclass have a 50% dropout rate from high school.'\n\n5. Get big foundations and business to give these efforts lots of money. I would invest in ethnic identity, and I would establish the cult of 'Victimology...' I would get all minorities to think that their lack of success was the fault of the majority. I would start a grievance industry blaming all minority failure on the majority.'\n\n6. Include dual citizenship and promote divided loyalties. I would celebrate diversity over unity. I would stress differences rather than similarities. Diverse people worldwide are mostly engaged in hating each other - that is when they are not killing each other. A diverse, peaceful, or stable society is against most historical precept. People undervalue the unity it takes to keep a nation together. Look at the ancient Greeks. The Greeks believed that they belonged to the same race; they possessed a common language and literature; they worshipped the same gods. All Greece took part in the Olympic games. A common enemy, Persia, threatened their liberty. Yet all these bonds were not strong enough to overcome two factors: local patriotism and geographical conditions that nurtured political divisions. Greece fell. 'E. Pluribus Unum' -- From many, one. In that historical reality, if we put the emphasis on the 'pluribus' instead of the 'Unum,' we will 'Balkanize' America as surely as Kosovo.'\n\n7. I would place all subjects off limits. Make it taboo to talk about anything against the cult of 'diversity.' I would find a word similar to 'heretic' in the 16th century - that stopped discussion and paralyzed thinking. Words like 'racist' or 'xenophobe' halt discussion and debate. Having made America a bilingual/bi-cultural country, having established multi-culturalism, having the large foundations fund the doctrine of 'Victimology,' I would next make it impossible to enforce our immigration laws. I would develop a mantra: That because immigration has been good for America, it must always be good. I would make every individual immigrant symmetric and ignore the cumulative impact of millions of them.'\n\n8. In the last minute of his speech, Governor Lamm wiped his brow. Profound silence followed. Finally, he said, 'Lastly, I would censor Victor Hanson Davis's book 'Mexifornia.' His book is dangerous. It exposes the plan to destroy America. If you feel America deserves to be destroyed, don't read that book.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How to Destroy America"}

The idea of negative liberty came up which is the idea that when oppression happens it is the fault of the government (simplified definition but this in a nutshell) something I would think most of us would believe. Then the professor started to talk about discrimination and gave the example that happened a couple of years ago of the gay couple that wanted to buy a cake from a religious bakery and the bakers declined. When the couple wanted to take legal action the bakers said that the government can't tell them who they can sell to and also that would be against the first amendment of freedom of religion. This got me thinking about what if it was a white baker refusing to bake for a black couple or vise versa. Would the baker be able to say the same thing? I thought no because racism would be against the Non Aggression Principle and also its not in the constitution that you can discrimination against someones race just because of your own prejudices.\n\nBut I wanted to know what other libertarians thought of this issue. Would the baker be in the right for not serving a couple because of their race and if not should the government do something about it or should that as well be left to the free market?

{"author":"micahmind","created_utc":1512001747,"num_comments":20,"score":8,"selftext":"I'm an avid supporter of free markets and libertarian ideals. But in the debates about Net Neutrality I've seen a lot of people saying the repeal is good because less regulation is good and free markets will save the day.\n\nFree markets will not save this day.\n\nFree markets are not magic. They are not powered by the incantations of Austrians and anarchists. \n\nFree markets work because consumers and producers both have power. When both sides have power, it's more profitable to work together towards a mutually beneficial exchange than to fight each other over resources. Free markets work because the customers have the power to say \"I'm not buying\" or \"I'm not buying from you until you service me better.\" And that power is real.\n\nIn our current dilemma, Net Neutrality is protected inside a vast and heavy series of regulations commonly referred to as Title 2. All of these regulations are not reasonable to enforce on modern day ISPs, and they haven't been. But the fear is that they could be. This regulation represents power that the FCC has over ISPs. Real power, in ways only the government can wield.\n\nMeanwhile ISPs have been merging together and bribing local politicians to keep others from renting their fiber or laying new fiber. This means that for me, and 78% of Americans, if we want internet speeds above 25Mb/s, our choice is between internet from one provider or no internet. If we want speeds above 100Mb/s, 90% of Americans have the choice between 0 and 1 providers. \n\nThis takes away the power 78-90% of Americans have in this market. It is no longer more profitable to work together towards a mutually beneficial exchange. It is not a free market, because I am not free in my decision, so the free market can't save this situation until the power is balanced again.\n\n\"But you don't have to buy internet\". This is technically true. While I do need water to survive, I don't need internet for my body to continue living. However, how many of your livelihoods would be damaged if not destroyed without the internet? In the modern economy our ability to earn a living rests heavily on our access to high speed internet, and our customers' access to high speed internet. Internet has become nearly as integral to businesses as water is to my body, and choosing not to have it is choosing to blow up a large chunk of the foundation we've been building on for the past 20 years. \n\nFurthermore, it's not competitive. I'm don't work for an ISP, so I do have to compete on price and service. If my business stops buying internet to exercise our power in the market, we will be providing poorer service to our customers and they will rightly choose our competitors. So we still don't have power.\n\nFree markets will only work when they are truly free, when both sides have the power to choose freely. Freeing one without freeing the other only enslaves consumers to the one with power.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"[Rant] Free Markets are not magic"}
