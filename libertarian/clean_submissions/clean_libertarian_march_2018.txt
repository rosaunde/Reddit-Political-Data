{"author":"DrRavenBlack","created_utc":1519926300,"num_comments":27,"score":75,"selftext":"Can I vent for a couple of minutes? I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this. It's nice to be heard and understood. This gun debate thing and the bias of this disgusting MSM media is really bringing anger out of me. Enough that I haven't though about Bitcoin in hours. Some history first about myself. MY politics grew from the punk rock movement, and I guess I considered myself a liberal for most of my teens and early 20's. Really, I just hated the goddamn government in it's entirety. I used to do live sound, and I did the warp tour the year when Bush took us into that fucking war. There was political hate everywhere. Bands were singing about it. Not my president shirts were being sponsored by Vans. It felt good, people gave a fuck. Then it all stopped for 8 years when Obama got elected. This was my awaking, I guess you'd say. My awaking to the control on the stuff we get our information from. It's also  when race became a weapon against political discussion. I don't need to go into why Obama was no different than Bush, or Trump, or any of these fucks. That conversation is old news to anyone that knows how to check voting records, and donor list of their elected officials. No, I want to talk about that. I want to talk about the liberal party because I have no idea who the fuck these people are anymore. Are they brainwashed? Hypocrites? Shills for the elite? What the fuck is going on? They've gone off the fucking rails. In my opinion they are way more a threat than the alt right to this country. I hate both by the way. I'll never forget what I did at an Anti Flag show. I got drunk backstage, and yelled at the lead singer \" I'm glad you're concerned about the corruption in this country now that Trump is in the spotlight, but have you been hibernating for the last fucking 8 years.\" Fucking Poser, said something trendy like \"listen to this record, man. we're fighting fascism\" and his little fan girls approved and looked at me like I was a fucking conservative or something. Fighting Fascism, yeah that asshole missed a lot during the Obama years. Fast forward to today and all I can say is \"Holy Shit\" we are in a gun ban debate and liberals are siding with corporations and government. People I used to consider smart people are showing the intelligence of a 5 year old and they're really fucking authoritarian. So the rest of this is going to address these liberals. Here is good negotiation for the liberals to redeem themselves from being total fucking hypocrites. We ban all guns. That's right all guns, but hold your excitement. That also includes the trigger happy police and the security that protects the thieving 1% politicians and businessmen. Yeah, they don't get guns either. Also, we stop bombing other countries, and training 18 year olds to be killers. The MSM have to stop promoting war and trying to ignite a race war. MSM also has to ban all commercials promoting Big Pharma. Hollywood has to stop promoting violence for a profit and self glorifying awards. Never going to happen is it liberals? This is why the gun control debate is bullshit. We need protection from the goddamn police. We need protection from the actions and the policies of our politicians. They have spent the last hundred years terrorizing almost every country in the fucking world. The 1% have fleeced almost all the wealth in this country by crony capitalism, regulations that stiffle everyone but themselves. Everyone keeps going on about mental illness. Maybe it's this country and this society that is the mental illness. Everyone that hasn't been born without a silver spoon in this country feels hopeless, desperate, and angry. The meddling of Bitcoin by the banks, IRS, and SEC shows how this system really works and who politicians are really loyal 2. The left and Right both own this shit. Fuck all of them. American politicians have made a lot of enemies domestically and foreign. Those people they have harmed have a right to be pissed, and I am not condoning any actions they may or may not do. We don't deserve to be victims of their actions. Most of us can't hide in a bunker with 12 deep armed security, when shit hit's the fan. Get a clue liberals. You hate Trump, fine. I give 2 shit's. Another puppet of the central bankers. Yawn, what else is fucking new. We could get a real dictator if you keep this shit up. I'm not a violent person. I want to live free, take responsibility for myself, and have a chance to make money without the government stepping on my neck. Everyone should learn how to protect themselves using firearms. The same way everyone should have a proper education on how to manage money. Money backed by something. Your utopia is a dream that will be eaten by wolves. Women and children need this protection more than anyone. With all these goddamn rapist and perverts out there. Liberals have not just become a danger to themselves, but it's starting to effect all of us. You motherfuckers trust your government to much. It's like dating someone who's cheated on you 10 times. If you trust them your a goddamn idiot, How many lying boobs do you have to put into office, until you finally understand, it's pointless. They're all fucking evil lying bastards. The government, the central banks, and the state owned media create the chaos that frightens you. They tell you who your enemy is. Well let me tell you. They are your fucking enemy, and until they pay for their sins all of us are at risk as Americans. Until then I'm keeping my goddamn gun, and my Prozac motherfuckers.

Some people think that these players are fairly compensated by being provided with a full scholarship and being able to showcase their talents for scouts at the next level. Others say that the value being provided to the players is negligible compared to the massive amount of money being generated by the television deals. \n\nI know there is no catch-all opinion, but I would be interested to hear what this sub thinks.

{"author":"foslforever","created_utc":1520112018,"num_comments":27,"score":42,"selftext":"There are 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. The U.S. population is 324,059,091 as of June 22, 2016. Do the math: 0.00925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is insignificant! What is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:\n\n\n\u2022 65% of those deaths are by suicide, which would never be prevented by gun laws.\n\n\u2022 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified.\n\n\u2022 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons \u2013 better known as gun violence.\n\n\u2022 3% are accidental discharge deaths.\nSo technically, \"gun violence\" is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. Still too many? Now lets look at how those deaths spanned across the nation.\n\n\u2022 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago\n\n\u2022 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore\n\n\u2022 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit\n\n\u2022 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years)\n\n\nSo basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.\nThis basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169 and Alabama had 1.\n\nNow, who has the strictest gun laws by far? California, of course, but understand, it is not guns causing this. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. So if all cities and states are not created equal, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.\n\nAre 5,100 deaths per year horrific? How about in comparison to other deaths? All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. Robbery, death, rape, assault are all done by criminals. It is ludicrous to think that criminals will obey laws. That is why they are called criminals.\n\n\nBut what about other deaths each year?\n\n\u2022 40,000+ die from a drug overdose\u2013THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT!\n\n\u2022 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths.\n\n\u2022 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide).\n\nNow it gets good:\n\n\u2022 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer walking in the worst areas of Chicago than you are when you are in a hospital!\n\n\u2022 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. It\u2019s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! \n\nSo what is the point? If the liberal loons and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total number of gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides ................ Simple, easily preventable 10% reductions! So you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why the focus on guns? It's pretty simple: Taking away guns gives control to governments. The founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and seek to rule as the British did by trying to disarm the populace of the colonies. It is not difficult to understand that a disarmed populace is a controlled populace.\n\nThus, the second amendment was proudly and boldly included in the U.S. Constitution. It must be preserved at all costs. So the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from Noah Webster: \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed.\"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"A rant on gun related deaths in the US"}

His coming will usher in the millennium, a period of peace and harmony, when the lamb will lay down with the lion. In a certain sense, therefore, both the Jews and Christians share the same hope \u2013 that the messiah will come. The only difference is that Christians believe he has already visited earth once, in the form of Jesus, whereas Jews reject this idea.\n\nChristians have a narrative about Jesus and the Jews. They believe the Jews made a mistake. They believe the Jews misunderstood the prophecy of the old testament. The Jewish leadership, so the story goes, thought the messiah would be a great king, a great military hero, who would recapture the holy land, and free Israel from imperial domination. According to the Christians, they were wrong.  They were looking for the wrong thing. Their minds were not open to a different, better type of savior. Therefore, they were unable to see the messiah that god actually sent. When Jesus claimed to be the son of god, and was crucified, the Jewish leadership believed that that proved that he was not the savior. Why didn\u2019t he save himself if he was? Christians explain that the Jews fumbled by being too certain that they knew god\u2019s plan. Because of their narrow preconception, they were unable to see the savior passing right in front of their eyes.\n\nWhether you believe in the Christian narrative or not, the fact that billions of people have believed it demonstrates that ideas of divinity can change. As time and circumstances change, the religious leadership of any era will necessarily conform their teachings about god to the demands of the time. In a pre-Greco-Roman era, for example, the idea of a great conqueror messiah might have been what the Jewish people needed. It might have united them. It might have given them the strength to endure subjugation, war, and conquest. But in the Roman era, any thought of military conquest was inconceivable, and potentially dangerous. The old concept of a conqueror god was therefore discarded, and a new ideal of god was crafted by contemporary religious leaders. This new ideal better matched the necessities of the time.  It promoted a new type of god, one that offered salvation only in the afterlife. This new divinity called for people to reject temporal victory, and model their lives after the unconditional surrender of Jesus. Instead of hoping for a god who would bring justice on earth, the new religion taught people to abandon any hope for redemption in the temporal world. As Frederich Nietzche argued, Christianity became a vessel by which the persecuted (who he called the \u201cslaves\u201d) took the pitiful, helpless figure of a crucified man and used it to construct a new ideal \u2013 a messiah whose unseen kingdom existed outside space and time. As centuries passed, that ideal served the purpose for which is was originally crafted. It gave the dispossessed the strength to soldier on and endure. It offered them the promise of heaven. Within a thousand years, Christianity was ascendant, and the Christian values had became dominant \u2013 the law of the land.\n\nIf this interpretation of the transition from Judaism to Christianity is true, if the concept of god was changed, if it is malleable, and can be changed by religious leaders to conform to contemporary societal needs, then the question arises: How much could the concept of god change? Is there any form that would be impossible for religious leaders to make divine? If religious leaders in one era can deify the incredibly powerful symbol of a militaristic, conquering old testament messiah, and religious leaders of another era can deify the incredibly pitiful symbol of a sacrificial messiah, then what would be impossible to deify? The difference between these two is so stark, that it would seem that anything, whether beautiful and sublime, or pitiful and ugly has the potential to be elevated to divinity, if necessary. Arguably the possibilities of things to make divine include even non-human forms. Some scholars argue, for example, that ideologies such as communism and fascism are modern, non-theistic religions. But are there other, yet undeveloped non-theistic religions that might conform better to contemporary societal needs? I will return to this question later in the essay.\n\nWhatever the forms that divinity may take in theory, to succeed in practice, a religion must ultimately serve a purpose. Successful religious leaders must craft a god, or ideal of divinity that responds to the unspoken needs of the people. The form of divinity must motivate and give hope; it must give purpose; it must offer something in which people can believe, it must elaborate a system of sanctions, and offer a reward. Under this paradigm, religion is not the mandate of a divine being, but instead the enlightened effusion of the wise or learned in any particular era. They are the true givers of law. The law they give is not arbitrary, however. It is their \u201cbest guess\u201d as to which values society needs and will respond to at a particular moment in time. To successfully take hold, their divine ideal and system of values must resonate with some profound, unexpressed need or hope. The Christian Jesus, for example, must have spoken to the unconscious wishes of the underclass in the Roman Empire. Likewise, any new concept of god, must promote the right set of values, at the right time.\n\nBut having the right set of values alone is not sufficient. If religious leaders want to change the prevalent concept of divinity, they must find a way to bridge the new ideal with the old. No matter how much they might wish, they will not succeed in creating a new concept of god, without referring it to and framing it against the old. The new values must be grafted onto the old. Religious leaders must be patient and develop a plausible narrative that provides continuity, and serves as the \u201cconnective tissue\u201d between the two. Concepts of god necessarily change slowly, over many generations.  Neither a person, nor a people will abandon their religion without a fight. A religious belief when it takes hold of a mind is a very serious matter. Arguably, the entire evolutionary purpose of religion is to give each person a sense of meaning, and to group together like minded people willing to fight and die for their beliefs. In this sense, religion would not serve its purpose if it was easy to uproot and change.\n\nThe development of Christianity demonstrates this point. Consider the transition from a Jewish warrior-god messiah to a Christian sacrificial-god messiah. There is a huge difference between the two. Early Christian leaders must have been confronted with this discontinuity.  If Jews were raised to believe in one type of messiah, how might they ever pivot and begin believing in something fundamentally different? To bridge this chasm Christian leaders developed the narrative of the error of the Jewish leadership that I have explained above.  This explanation, as nonsensical and counterintuitive as it might seem, gave those Jews who were inclined to the Christian concept of god the cover they needed to make the transition. The explanation acted as a catalyst, permitting them to believe in the new god, while not overtly abandoning their old god (since according to the explanation, the new faith was actually the same as the old one). Similarly, early Christians patterned many of the rituals, symbols, and festivals of Christianity off the pagan religion which was all around them. Doing so must have made early Christianity seem more familiar. This familiarity would have made pagan conversions easier.\nIf everything thus far is accurate, we should now be able to abstract some general principles about the formation of a new religion. First, the conditions must be right. There must be a dissatisfaction with the old forms of divinity. The conditions and circumstances of the society must have changed dramatically as compared to the conditions and circumstances that were conducive to the old god. They must have changed enough so that the old god is not longer able to satisfy the deepest, most profound contemporary longings. People must be seeking a new direction, a new source of meaning. Second, there must be a religious leadership that recognizes consciously or not, that new values are needed for the survival and restoration of balance and harmony to the world. The new religious leadership must be willing to craft a new concept of god consistent with those values. They must be willing to seek that god in unconventional forms and symbols. They must recognize that if an appropriate symbol or ideal of god is found, people will have the capacity to deify it and see it as sacred. This is true even if the new concept of god seems very unconventional or very unlike the old concept of god. Finally, the religious leadership must find a way to craft a narrative connecting the old god to the new. In doing so they will facilitate conversion to the new faith.\n\nWe are now ready to apply the lessons of history to our present day. No sober observer of the contemporary world could say that any Abrahamic god still suffices. New ideas such as the theory of evolution, modern insights into the nature and formation of the universe, contemporary critical scholarship of the sacred biblical texts, and comparative anthropology, have rendered a fatal blow to the old gods. As Neitzche himself argued a century and a half ago: \u201cGod is dead.\u201d But then\u2026 what shall replace Him? Humans need a religion, they need a source of meaning. There is no escaping it. The need for a story, a narrative, an idea around which to organize and for which to fight is one of the greatest evolutionary adaptations of humankind.\n\nWhere there is demand the market will attempt to create supply. Since the beginning of the decline of Christianity, certain philosophers in the western world have attempted to create new religions. They have failed. They may have had noble intentions, but their \u201cbest guesses\u201d of the values society needed turned out to be wrong. Their ideal deities turned out to be \u201cfalse gods\u201d who brought destruction and ruin, instead of peace and prosperity. Each group in turn, promoted their respective religion. Each in turn, failed. Among them were nationalism, communism, fascism, democracy, and socialism. They failed because they did not conform to the hopes, wishes, and needs of a people confronting new challenges. The enlightenment and the industrial revolution had put humankind in very different circumstances compared to those in which Christianity and Islam had developed. People sought, and still seek, something correspondingly new and different.\n\nBut the modern religions offered nothing but a bastardization of the Abrahamic concept of god. They were all attempts to bring the Abrahamic god down to earth, but not to fundamentally change its nature. These new religions tapped into the Christian ideal of an all powerful deity, but attached it to the state or a \u201cgreat leader\u201d who was anything but all powerful. So, instead of being told to pray to a disembodied spirit in the sky, people were now told to vote for or worship a disembodied state. Instead of fearing a sky god, they were taught to fear the leviathan state. Instead of having faith in eternal justice and salvation, they were told that justice and salvation could be achieved through the systemic violence of the state \u2013 an absurdity. These new religions were not new at all. They were an attempt to bring the Judeo-Christian god unchanged, into the temporal world \u2013 an impossibility\nIt\u2019s as if the early Christians, instead of selecting a completely new symbol around which to rally \u2013 the pitiful and crucified Jesus, had instead attempted to deify the leader of the failed Jewish rebellion against the Romans. You could imagine how that religion might have taken hold for a while because a military leader was at least similar to what the Jews expected. But in the end, that religion would have failed. It would not have offered a sufficiently different concept of god. It would have only been the old concept of the messiah, refashioned and diluted. Why would a failed military leader be preferable to the old ideal of an all conquering messiah? Such a religion would not really offer new solutions. It would have been a step backwards. What was needed, and ultimately succeeded, was a fundamentally different ideal of the deity. One that conformed to the people\u2019s needs. A crucified Christ, for example.\n\nSimilarly, when modern people were first presented with the new religions they initially responded positively.  Perhaps they thought: \u201cMaybe this is the next step forward! Maybe this will lead to a better world!\u201d But eventually they realized their error, and faced the dissatisfying choice of either reverting back to their old god, who they had abandoned, or seeking in vain for some other ideal that promised meaning. Many people today find themselves in exactly this state. They are discontented or unconvinced by traditional concepts of god, but also dissatisfied with the modern alternatives. They exist in a sort of existential limbo, an uncomfortable state of disbelief, lacking real purpose or direction.\n\nBut if the modern religions were and are destined to fail, then is there a new religion that could offer a new form of deity that DOES actually conforms to contemporary needs? If there is, it would have to describe a new, radically different understanding of god. It would have to very deliberately NOT be a redesign of the Abrahamic god. It must be something completely different, and it must explain why the Abrahamic concept of god is wrong.\nI believe anarchism could be fashioned into just such a religion. In fact, I do not believe anarchists can ever hope to achieve a stateless society until we do just that. It is all well and good for philosophers and economists capable and willing to read huge tomes, and able to comprehend long chains of reasoning to understand the reasons why everyone should share the anarchist values of self-ownership, non-aggression, and private property. But for the majority of people these values will not take hold until we, the \u201creligious leaders\u201d of anarchism, root them in an integrated system of belief. As reluctant as many anarchists may be to do so, we must bring god into the discussion.\n\nReligions serve to sacralize, elevate, and deify certain symbols or ideas.  The religion of anarchism would be no different. But what needs to be made sacred if our goal is a stateless society? What form must our new god take to bring about that end? What ideal form should we deify? What would get people to revere and respect private property? What form of god would get them to recognize and respect the boundaries that exist between themselves and others?\n\nThe answer is that the religion of anarchism would teach each person that he has a responsibility to develop his own sense of deity, that he himself must become god, or at least his own living representation of god incarnate on earth. Because, at root the errors of statism stem from a willingness by some people to project their form of god onto others. Such projection is a disrespect of the boundary that exists between separate minds. Your god is not my god. No matter how convinced you might be that he is, he isn\u2019t. This point cannot be over emphasized. Your god, really is ONLY your god. In fact, the form your god takes, is YOU. It is not ME. It is not acceptable for a person to impose his form of god, as the \u201cright\u201d form for everyone. Even if he does so in secret. Doing so denies the sovereignty of others, and it is a simple logical step from believing you know my god better than me, to believing you should control my property. True individual sovereignty will only be achieved when each person is challenged to develop his own unique understanding of what it means to be god. Only then will aggression against another, and violations of property boundaries be seen as something unholy, and sacrilegious, a form of deicide. So to answer the question about anarchism\u2019s form of god: Anarchists want to shatter the collective god. We want god to exist independently in each mind. We seek to prohibit any unity in the concept of god.\n\nBuilding a religion within which each person is recognized as a deity, may seem bizarre, even contradictory. Skeptics may argue that \u201ca religion where everyone is god, is no religion at all!\u201d Well\u2026 perhaps\u2026 At some point the argument becomes one of semantics. How do you define \u201creligion\u201d?  Perhaps it would be better to classify the religion of anarchism as a type of meta-religion. Maybe that would make it easier to understand. The meta-religion of anarchism, would serve only as a scaffolding, a comprehensible system of ethics, and rules for co-existence on earth that all deities (meaning people) would respect. Each would be free to peacefully develop their own understanding of their place in the cosmic order. Anarchism would permit any interpretation of non-ethical questions such as the existence or lack thereof of free-will, continued life or lack thereof after death, or ultimate purpose. Unlike the old religions, anarchist dogma would be silent on these questions.\n\nThe practical consequence of each person being his own god, is that no person could excuse his actions, by blaming them on some other deity. Instead, as a god, each person would be expected to become a law giver, and be responsible for his own actions. With no godhead in the state, and no godhead in the sky, a person would have nothing behind which to hide. When he or she is accused of a crime, and claims as a defense \u201cI did it because I was ordered,\u201d every anarchist would reply: \u201cBut you are a god. A god does not follow another god\u2019s orders without reason. Why did you obey?\u201d Ignorance also would not excuse crimes. \u201cYou had a responsibility to know. You are a god after all.\u201d\n\nObviously, creating a religion in which each person is a deity would be a radical departure from traditional religions. Abrahamic religions, for example, explicitly prohibit any person, or people from thinking they can be gods. In their creation story god condemned adam and eve for giving into the temptation of the tree of knowledge: \u201c\u2026 your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.\u201d Genesis 3:5. Later, god supposedly divided mankind and confused their languages to punish them for their arrogance in trying to reach heaven by constructing a tower of babel.\nBut these are just stories. They are stories that were imagined in the minds of men. They were stories specifically designed by some men to prevent other men from attempting to do the same thing the original group had done themselves: to attempt to interpret the mysteries of life and the cosmos, to create laws, and give form to the unknown ultimate cause of the universe. They were stories designed, perhaps unconsciously, to enslave men\u2019s minds.\nBut the priests of a future religion of anarchism could tell stories too. Perhaps our creation story will be something along these lines: \u201cIn the beginning there were men. Some men imagined a god. They told stories about their god. But they were afraid. They were afraid that other men might also imagine a god. What if the new men imagined a new god that was different from the old god? That might mean that the original god, was not the only god. The original men did want there to be another god. They wanted everyone to believe in only their god. So these men created a story. They told the other men that long before a man had been punished for trying to become god. They called this punishment \u201coriginal sin.\u201d They blamed all the problems of the world on this sin. But the religion of anarchism teaches that it was the story of original sin itself, that was the original sin. For this story was an attempt by some men to arrogate to themselves the exclusive right to describe god. And this sin is what has caused mankind to live in a desert ever since. But there is a way out of the desert. Each individual must defy the collective god, and become his own god.\u201d\n\nThe stories told by the priests of anarchism could explain something else. They could reconcile the religion of anarchism with the old religions. Like the early Christians who told a story about the error of the Jewish leaders, as a way to explain how Jesus, a pitiful crucified criminal could actually be god, we could describe the errors of the religious leaders of the past. We could explain that all ancient Abrahamic religions had a story about a messiah. We could explain that the universality of this symbol shows that men have always unconsciously hoped and prayed for the day that they themselves would rise, throw off their mental constraints, and realize that if anything is god, they are.  For millennia, we could explain, men waited for a god in the form of a man, to come save them, and because they thought that the messiah would necessarily be outside of themselves, they were unable to realize that they, themselves were called to be their own god-savior. We could call on all men to finally realize the prophecy for themselves \u2013 to rise and become law givers, to come in glory and judge the living and the dead. \u201cTo judge the living and the dead? I want to! But by what standard shall I judge them?\u201d They might ask. It is this moment that we will have an opening to explain praxeology and the ethics of liberty.\n\nThis and other essays, available exclusively here:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Plan-End-State-Revolution-liberty/dp/B01BI59DIA","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The Religion of Anarchism: A New Form of God"}

The U.S. population is 324,059,091 as of June 22, 2016. Do the math: 0.00925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is insignificant! What is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:\n\n\n\u2022 65% of those deaths are by suicide, which would never be prevented by gun laws.\n\n\u2022 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified.\n\n\u2022 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons \u2013 better known as gun violence.\n\n\u2022 3% are accidental discharge deaths.\nSo technically, \"gun violence\" is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. Still too many? Now lets look at how those deaths spanned across the nation.\n\n\u2022 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago\n\n\u2022 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore\n\n\u2022 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit\n\n\u2022 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years)\n\n\nSo basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.\nThis basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169 and Alabama had 1.\n\nNow, who has the strictest gun laws by far? California, of course, but understand, it is not guns causing this. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. So if all cities and states are not created equal, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.\n\nAre 5,100 deaths per year horrific? How about in comparison to other deaths? All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. Robbery, death, rape, assault are all done by criminals. It is ludicrous to think that criminals will obey laws. That is why they are called criminals.\n\n\nBut what about other deaths each year?\n\n\u2022 40,000+ die from a drug overdose\u2013THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT!\n\n\u2022 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths.\n\n\u2022 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide).\n\nNow it gets good:\n\n\u2022 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer walking in the worst areas of Chicago than you are when you are in a hospital!\n\n\u2022 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. It\u2019s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! \n\nSo what is the point? If the liberal loons and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total number of gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides ................ Simple, easily preventable 10% reductions! So you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why the focus on guns? It's pretty simple: Taking away guns gives control to governments. The founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and seek to rule as the British did by trying to disarm the populace of the colonies. It is not difficult to understand that a disarmed populace is a controlled populace.\n\nThus, the second amendment was proudly and boldly included in the U.S. Constitution. It must be preserved at all costs. So the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from Noah Webster: \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed.\"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"A rant on gun related deaths in the US""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"u_smkeblunts-strchcunt","title":"A rant on gun related deaths in the US"}

I am a young British libertarian who wants to see my country succeed and wants to be genuinely proud of it. But I struggle to do so because there are so many problems with it. Don't get me wrong I'm proud of the accomplishments (of which there are many) of my nation but I feel like we have stagnated and we need a new engine not just more petrol (or gas as you yanks call it).\n\nSo in this post I am going to summarise 3 things: Why it is hard being a Libertarian in Britain, Why Britain sorely needs libertarianism and some ideas on how we can further libertarian thought and activism in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhy is it hard being a Libertarian in Britain?\n\nThis only requires a one word answer: Apathy, The majority of Britons don't care about politics, they see both sides as evil and just trying to grow power and money for their rich friends, so many may think \"isnt that the ideal environment for a Libertarian movement to grow\", unfortunately its not. Many people view libertarians in 2 ways here: Either pot smoking junkies who have no respect for law and order or evil hardcore Thatcherites who just want rid of the basic institutions that make this country what it is. I personally don't identify with either of these groups, while I would identify as a Thatcherite, I'm not a hard core thatcherite and I feel the policies of thatcher are deeply misunderstood - especially in the north (where I was born and bred), the other alternative Is no better, I'm not a pot head and I have the utmost respect for the law and rightful authority. Until these stereotypes go away no progress can be made on furthering libertarianism in Britain\n\nThere is one more problem however: while the majority of people like neither parties they refuse to vote for a different party and this is not because of the lesser evil thought that is present in America but because the media markets them as Extremist or even as just plain old loony tunes (see monster raving loony party or many other parody parties). For this reason a minor party cannot have anything more than minor political exposure. See UKIP an example, a majorly successful minor party received 2 Seats in Parliament out of 650.\n\nWhy does Britain need libertarianism\n\nBritain has serious problems but I will focus on 3 in depth: the NHS, The economy and Crime\n\nThe NHS is failing in Britain, many people cite cuts as the reason for this, I personally believe it is different. Many people see privatisation as this great evil, when In reality it is barely privatisation at all, so called \"privatisation\" consists of supply lines being privatised, something that in most single payer systems is the norm anyway. The NHS has no major Motivation to be efficient other than a personal moral motivation to help people. This could easily be solved by working with the private sector, it could seriously bring efficiency and success to a failing institution\n\nAs for the economy, Britain is once again the sick man of Europe and soon the world. Economic growth is anemic but unemployment is very low. How can this be? Well the answer is again quite simple: the UK economy is a job creating machine however it produces a lot of low paid jobs and not many well paid jobs. So what does the UK need, radical change. Tax cuts, True deregulation (not cutting necessary regulation but the unnecessary regulation instead) and more effective use of taxpayer money as well as mass privatisation. All this alongside other libertarian policies could fix the anemic economy that Britain suffers from through raising wages and increasing spending creating more good paying jobs for the British people\n\nThe third problem is crime, more specifically drug fuelled crime. Criminalisation of drugs in the UK has been a failure. Drug use is rampant in the UK and this combined with drug criminalisation is a deadly cocktail. Drug culture today produces further crime, someone using a drug once can be sucked into a culture that promotes crime, disorder and general uncivilised behaviour. So what can we do to fix this. Quite simply decriminalisation should go a long way to solve this, if we stopped viewing drug users as criminals they would stop viewing themselves as criminals and become less separated from society, this wouldn't be the only benefit but I'm sure everyone on this subreddit will be aware of what we should decriminalise drugs.\n\nAll of these solutions are libertarian in nature and could go a long way to fixing Britain as a country\n\nSo what can we do?\n\nI think a big problem in the UK is association with the word libertarian: UKIP under farage were classical Liberal in a lot of manners, however they avoided this by pursuing a nationalist base. While this also proved unsuccessful I do believe that there is a middle ground that is yet to be found.\n\nAnother important thing for any emerging parties in the UK is the untapped resource in British politics: the Internet. The Internet is a huge campaign resource, yet for many it is untapped, we are beginning to see its impact such as with Leave.eu's targeted ad campaign but an engaging social media campaign could really help with the apathy that plagues British politics and could be a vital tool for an emerging party trying to start a movement\n\nAnother big issue that parties face is the FPTP system, this can be avoided however. Libertarians should focus on key seats gradually expanding like the LP UK had tried to do in the 2017 GE, this will allow for a base to be established and for a faster growth with less resources by drawing publicity in one area that will spread out nationally - especially if a significant result is achieved\n\nBut I feel like all of these solutions alone will not be enough,\n\nSo I ask you, what can we do as libertarians in Britain to fix the country we love?

{"author":"EternalPropagation","created_utc":1520207767,"num_comments":7,"score":1,"selftext":"One of the issues I have with libertarianism is how do we decide who the NAP applies to? Does it apply to fetuses? Does it apply to animals? Does it apply to humans who have changed their DNA beyond recognition? Does it apply to AI? Every one of these cases and more than I can't even fathom will all have to go through a strenuous government decision which is funny for a libertarian society.\n\nOne of the solutions to this problem already exists today: stocks in a corporation. There is no gray area when it comes to who is a shareholder and who isn't: you either own a stock or you don't. Why can't the same principle be applied to personhood? If you're capable of buying a stock that denotes your personhood then you are objectively a person no matter what other shareholders think. All you'd need to do is find a single existing shareholder who is willing to hand over a stock of their own free will. This means you'll most likely need to give them something for it of course but if you're capable of acquiring money and participating in free trade then you have all the qualifications of being a person. \n\nI do imagine there will be cases where shares will just be given out to 'non-persons' by activists who want to do a charitable deed. This means that even if you're not capable of participating in free trade there is still an avenue for you to become a person since all it takes is a single charitable person. Right now, it would take over half this country to say 'dogs, cats, pigs, and cows are people' and it would take years and billions in propaganda. In my world, activists don't need the majority's approval they can just start giving away shares immediately, no government-approval required. \n\nI think this solution is elegant since not only is it asserting free trade (it's my citizenship shouldn't I be allowed to sell my privileges to whomever I want?) it's also giving us an objective definition of \"Person.\" **A Person is simply some entity that is capable of participating in free trade.**\n\nSome issues I thought of: centralization of voting power can happen; how do we keep in check majority shareholders? I honestly don't know the answer to this since right now the majority shareholders of a corporation are kept in check by a government. I'd have to hope that shareholders aren't so dumb as to sell their shares to an almost-majority shareholder. But it would just end up being a constitutional monarchy if that happened. Ideally though, the society wouldn't need any democratic processes since everything would have an objective answer to it already and public opinion wouldn't be needed. Voting on what the income tax should be wouldn't be a thing since the answer is always 0. Voting on what the pollution tax should be would be up to the market but how many tons of CO2 will be allowed to be emitted might need to be put up to a vote. (I'm a geolibertarian).\n\nAnother way centralization of shareholder power is a non-issue is that when a majority shareholder has children they will divide up their shares to their children thus distributing this power. Same thing happens with wealth (see the Rothschilds). I guess some parents will chose a star pupil to give all/majority of the shares to but I don't think that's a wise evolutionary strategy since you're putting all your eggs into one basket and even if that basket is awesome it's still a risk.\n\nAnother issue is won't shareholder just run out of shares to give out/sell to non-persons? Yes and if the country is doing very well these shares will skyrocket in price and become unaffordable so that's why the common practice of inflating the shares is possible. Everyone's shares can just double in amount and thus each one will cost half as much. Will people vote for that though? I think they will since shareholders allow this inflation to happen today as well.\n\nI'd like to hear any other issues you can come up with or why this is a totally retarded idea or whatever. Thanks for reading my rant.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Objective definition for 'personhood'"}

Let's not ignore how city based laws are completely useless, as its easy to move guns around.

Heller  was a landmark decision in that it granted **individuals** the right to handguns and firearms for self-defense, a far-cry from the previously held view that only service in a militia (now national guard) had that right, but it never declared the right to bear arms an *Absolute Right*. In 2008 the court ruled  the right to bear arms doesn't bar the government from regulating firearms altogether, the justices said the government can legally ban guns from felons, the mentally ill, places like schools, government buildings, and churches. It also has the authority to declare conditions/qualifications for the commercial sale of guns. In 2014 the court muddied the waters further by upholding a ban on  people with records of domestic violence purchasing firearms, but an acquaintance could still buy a gun for that person. \n\nSo rather than continue this ignominious debate where one side yells \"We have the right to bear arms with no government interference!\" and the other side yells \"Take away all the guns!\" Why can't the Supreme Court just make a definitive, updated ruling that  leaves no room for vague interpretations of what the government can and can't limit?

Feel free to share, spread, or edit this. \n\n1. Recruit new gun owners. 1/3 of the US is *not* enough. Take people shooting, if you can afford it I would even buy your new shooting friends a basic .22 rifle if they can't and if they have the right attitude. Demystify guns, you don't want people's views to be based entirely around what is shouted in an increasingly bias and willing to lie media. Once they are active get them politically active. You just multiplied your voice by 2. Now do it again. \n\n2. Support and join [Gun Owners of America](https://www.gunowners.org/join.htm), the [2nd Amendment Foundation](https://www.saf.org/join-saf/), and if they jive with you [the NRA](https://membership.nra.org/Join/Annuals). There are other groups, state groups as well, join them. Participate. Surely you know gun owners that haven't joined them, get them to, at the very least get people on board with the action alerts (especially the [NRA-ILA](https://www.nraila.org/) ones which usually includes state level alerts). \n\n3. Call and email politicians every time they are anti-rights or promoting gun control bills or bills that restrict any part of the bill of rights not just the 2nd. **Every single time.** Yes you probably work and don't have time to read every bill, but that is why you joined organizations that do and that represent your views. If you signed up for those alerts you are in the know. Call, email, and comment on bills if your state allows it.\n\n4. Withdraw financial support from companies that don't support your rights. There might be some obvious ones but some less obvious ones as well. [Like Google](https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankminiter/2012/07/05/google-sadly-joins-the-anti-gun-brigade/#518575a450f6). If someone would like to post a list I can append it to the end of this post. \n\n5. Support technology that makes gun control impossible. See [FossCAD](http://fosscad.org/fc/), and [Ghost Gunner](https://ghostgunner.net/). If you can buy the milling machines or 3D printers (or become a full blown gun smith) then do so. Taking back the ability to produce takes back control. Buy a 3D printer, learn how to use it. Share the files. Also learn to reload. \n\n6. Vote, lobby, and recruit people towards pro-2A and pro-rights politicians. I think both the Left and the Right have the potential to swing libertarian in the coming years. Both major parties have their own versions of rot. Within your party of choice make sure your representatives and those running know your views on guns. Be vocal. \n\n7. Embrace privacy promoting technology. This one might sound weird but I believe pro-2A people should begin to embrace privacy promoting technology (VPNs like ProtonVPN), Tor, Signal Messenger, DuckDuckGo search, [anything but Gmail / Yahoo](https://alternativeto.net/software/gmail/), etc. If there are crackdowns on your rights in the future it would be best to limit how easy it is to reference all of your personal information. I left social media out here but you should consider the political positions of the platforms you are supporting via advertising and your personal info being sold. Consider supporting decentralized solutions over centralized solutions. User an ad / web tracker blocker. \n\n8. Support media creators of pro-2A media. Use Patreon / Cryptocurrency to do this. Support [alternatives to YouTube](https://alternativeto.net/software/youtube/) which has been shown to be hostile to gun owners. Support [alternatives to Twitter](https://alternativeto.net/software/twitter/) as well. \n\n9. Be civil when debating and spreading statistics and information. Creating enemies is no way to win allies. \n\n10. Be a responsible gun owner.\n\n11. Be willing to use jury nullification to invalidate unjust gun laws. \n\n12. Don't just show up when the 2nd is under attack, get off the ropes and urge your reps to push for PRO-GUN, ANTI-CRIMINAL laws. Be forward thinking and go on the offensive.\n\nDid I miss anything?

{"author":"shalampam","created_utc":1520369080,"num_comments":10,"score":12,"selftext":"All our freedoms are important, let me make that *Very* Clear, but some freedoms are more important than others, and in this case more neglected\n\nIn recent years freedom of speech and thought has been eroded (see C-16 in Canada) in the name of making people feel more comfortable to accepted and allowing people to feel safer . This seems like a relatively noble cause upon first glance, but it reveals a very sinister precedent upon closer examination\n\nLaws such as C-16 if unchallenged give governments the power to censor through the backdoor, in a democracy this is very worrying and this gets me to the core of my argument. Freedom of speech and thought is important for two reasons:\n\nDisagreement is key for a functioning democracy. I'm not a socialist, but I have friends that are. I believe that they are wrong, I believe they are wrong, but we have things we agree on. This is the core of how democracy works and this is why Freedom of belief is so important, if you can think these things you should be able to say them too, this allows for a democratic society to further itself which is why Freedom of Speech is such an important part of democracy.\n\nMy second reason is why it is crucial to the survival of democracy. Freedom of Speech allows you to hold a government accountable. Of the government is doing something you feel is wrong (freedom of belief) you make your voice heard and say it is wrong (freedom of expression), if you don't haven't freedom of expression you cannot express when you feel the government is doing things the wrong way and thus cannot influence its actions and hold it to account. This renders democracy useless and will lead to the fall of Western society if we allow it to happen. \n\nMany may argue however, \"C-16 just protects a person's right to feel safe in the workplace etc\", however this is not the point of the argument. C-16 requires force as it is a law enforced by government. If a workplace voluntarily enforced these rule there would be no worry for libertarians (however there may be worries for individuals about the state of society, but this is of course a separate argument). The problem with bills like C-16 is it gives a precedent to censor free speech and more worryingly freedom of belief. Soon things that people believe are normal could become enforceable by law, I'll out it this way, if you are a Liberal would you want a Conservative regulating what you can/cannot say and of course vice versa. \n\nWhile C-16 and bills of its kind are not inherently evil, the precedent they set and the ability they give governments to censor speech and belief very much is. \n\nBut as usual this comes down to the argument of whether good intentions or good action is more important, which you believe will determine how you view such an issue\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why Freedom of Speech and Thought Is the most important right"}

Also, I would be interested to hear what you think is the best way forward from a libertarian point of view. \n\nAs far as the midterms are concerned, I expect to see the GOP lose a significant number of seats in both the house and senate. How drastic the losses will be depends on the strength of the economy, and to perhaps a greater extent, how recently Trump has said something particularly stupid. My prediction is that the GOP loses house seats, but not an overall majority. In the senate, I expect the GOP to remain in control. \n\nThe 2020 election will be a very interesting referendum on Trump. Although I think Trump ultimately loses his presidency, I suspect it will be closer than many people think. Many Trump supporters are not the social media types, but that doesn't mean they won't turn out to vote, as we saw in 2016. \n\nThe 2020 election will again hinge on the democratic candidate. I think more people voted against Hillary than for Trump, and I could see the Dems drifting leftward (Warren/Sanders camp) or reaching back in the playbook and nominating a young, enthusiastic moderate like Cory Booker. \n\nFrom a libertarian perspective, I think we will continue to remain pretty much irrelevant on the national stage, although there is some encouraging growth in the party. I am not a registered Libertarian, but I do tend to vote that way. My question is this: what is the best strategy for spreading liberty politically? Has the Libertarian Party already lost its way/support? Are you against a pragmatic, more mainstream libertarian party, or do you think sticking to libertarian ideals is the best way forward?\n\nLooking forward to discussing. \n\nEDIT: [Here](https://www.270towin.com/) is an interesting website that allows the user to create a midterm election forecast interactively.

It is a poisonous form of individualism that encourages us to distrust one another and to eschew individual thinking in the narcissistic quest for self.\n\nMy dream job is to own/co-own a consulting company and work in a small collective of people I respect, not to be constantly under the thumb of a major corporation for my income and health insurance. I want to be able to speak my mind and dissent in public without fear of being labelled an \"alt-right\" agitator. I want a form of cosmopolitanism that allows people of different ethnic, religious, and sexual identities to live peacefully beside one another. I want to live in a community, not in an isolated suburban cookie-cutter house in a town full of strangers. I want a shared sense of citizenship and ideals and a cosmopolitan attitude that American cities a century ago fostered so well. America today feels deeply confused about its values. The choice is always between the \"progressive\" statism with its identity politics and moralizing social programs on the left, and the neo-conservative, militaristic, ultra-nationalist state on the right. Where is there room for the rest of us?\n\nI know I cannot be alone here, but I don't know how to make a difference. How do we begin? What are some possible solutions?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How can we improve the situation?"}

If a land piece isn't felt as owned by anyone, and rater is thrown in with someone who claims it, it defeats the definition of privately owned land. It becomes a form of ability rather than a form of property.\n\nI believe that there would have to be at least some completely unworked on land, no taxes being allowed to be put into it, to allow for property rights to be seen as actual property rather than ability. As with not supplying the definition on top, not having sizeable communable public land leads to the criminization of need rather than of action.\n\nAs in, homeless people will be forced into jail without proper uncontrolled public land, for acting on a need rather than strictly acting. It holds no terms to breaking the NAP because the land hasn't been claimed.

{"author":"Anarchy321","created_utc":1520509092,"num_comments":12,"score":14,"selftext":"Libertarian activism is in a period of stagnation, with very few libertarians participating in activism. In light of this, it is necessary to establish a strategy for libertarians to follow when planning and carrying out our activism. The following will serve as a template for a Strategy of Libertarian Activism:\n\n&gt; **Get Organized**\n\nLibertarians lack organization, even in New Hampshire, where libertarians are concentrating their efforts. Some say that herding cats is easier than organizing libertarians. I disagree. If you are a libertarian who cares about this ideology and our movement, you have a duty to join or form a libertarian organization. We can organize without sacrificing our individuality. Do not be afraid of those who will call you collectivist for the supposed crime of working together, they are not the individuals who will make the change they want to see. But *you* are one of those individuals. Libertarians have much to accomplish by working together. \n\n&gt; **Weaponize Capitalism; Pay your Dues**\n\nDo not simply join or form a libertarian organization.\n\nPay a monthly subscription to the organization. If 1000 members in a state organization pay 25 dollars a month, you will have $300,000 dollars a year. Multiplied by 50 states, we will have accrued 15 million dollars to support activist causes.\n\nFor half the price of an Xbox Live Subscription, you can build a powerful libertarian movement at the state or national level.\n\nWe must form into **Libertarian Alliances** of dues paying members. There are millions of libertarians and libertarian leaning individuals who would love to donate to a blossoming libertarian organization, and tens of thousands of committed libertarians who would love to become dues paying members of an equally committed libertarian organization. \n\nWhich brings me to my next suggestion:\n\n&gt; **Seek Funding**\n\nThe Koch Brothers, Americans for Prosperity, the Atlas Network: There are foundations and donors who will gladly support committed libertarian organizations.\n\nExploit this to your advantage.  \n\n&gt; **Disseminate Propaganda**\n\nLiterature, flyers, posters, pamphlets. Write it, distribute it, and recruit as many people as you can to the libertarian cause. Raise awareness of key libertarian issues in your community, and form coalitions around those issues. \n\n&gt; **Cooperate with Existing Libertarian Institutions and Organizations**\n\nStudents for Liberty, Young Americans for Liberty, The Cato Institute, the Mises Institute, The Atlas Network, the National Taxpayer\u2019s Union: We are much stronger when our organizations and institutions work together. Coordinate your actions; all clocks must strike at the same second. \n\n&gt; **Appear Moderate to the General Public**\n\nThe art of the revolutionary is to be a radical while appearing moderate. People must feel that your message is common sense, not extreme. This is why gun control advocates do not argue for the banning of semi-automatic firearms, per say, rather they advocate for \u201ccommon sense gun-control\u201d. Libertarians should not advocate for lowering taxes, per say, we should advocate for \u201ccommon sense tax reform\u201d. See what I did there? Now you do it. \n\n&gt; **Form Coalitions on Key Issues**\n\nIt worked with marijuana legalization. It worked with gay marriage. It can also work with lowering taxes. Each of us (and our organizations) should immediately contact and seek cooperation with the [National Taxpayer\u2019s Union](https://www.ntu.org/) to disseminate propaganda and organize demonstrations. We should attempt to entice Republicans with the message of \"common sense tax reform\" and ultimately unite under the same banner on this issue. \n\n&gt; **Concentrate Geographically**\n\nConsider joining the Free State Project. If your reason for not joining is that New Hampshire is too cold, shame on you. We are much more powerful when we concentrate geographically. New Hampshire libertarians have already been elected to public office with the NH House of Representatives, with at least 18 early movers currently holding office in the House of Representatives. \n\nThe New Hampshire Liberty Alliance has a publication called [The Gold Standard](https://www.nhliberty.org/gold_standard), which details the progress that has been made in repealing anti-liberty legislation. \n\nMove to New Hampshire, vote, and run for office so that we may continue to expand libertarian influence within the New Hampshire House of Representatives. \n\n&gt; **Coordinate Internationally**\n\nLibertarianism exists in many countries. \n\nBrazil and Poland have libertarian movements that are growing rapidly.\n\nEncourage the growth of libertarianism in these countries. Translate libertarian literature into foreign languages. Speak with foreign libertarians on Discord. Donate to their organizations.\n\nHelp them in any way you can.\n\nOn March 6, 2015, the Libertarian Party made history when former LP chairman Geoff Neale formed the [International Alliance of Libertarian Parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alliance_of_Libertarian_Parties). This alliance marks the first time in history that the Libertarian Parties of the world coordinated on an international scale. The IALP currently has 16 member parties, representing libertarians from 16 nations. \n\nWe must support the advance of international libertarianism in any way we can. \n\n&gt; **Participate in the Libertarian Party**\n\nBecome a card carrying, dues paying member of the LP. The LP needs money in order to carry out effective political campaigning. It also needs people will to knock on doors, advertise, and sign petitions on behalf of the party. If we work together, we can turn the Libertarian Party into a well-oiled machine and acquire more political influence. \n\nConsider running for office at the local or state level, particularly in New Hampshire, where libertarians have already achieved great success. \n\n&gt; **Attend Events**\n\nPorcfest, NH Liberty Forum, FreedomFest, Anarchapulco, etc. These events have been growing in attendance every year, yet a small fraction of the libertarian movement actually attends these events. These events are a great opportunity to share ideas and form new organizations, as well as to meet new libertarians. \n\n&gt; **Conclusion**\n\nThe time to organize is now. The time for action is now. We have the power to accomplish so much when we work together. So what are you waiting for? Get organized, accumulate capital, and become a crusader for liberty!\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Strategy of Libertarian Activism"}

I am a classical liberal but I also identify as a Liberal Interventionist. And I don't think being an interventionist and being a Libertarian have to be mutually exclusive.\n\nWhy are you an interventionist?\n\nI'm an interventionist by necessity not by a want for war, Contrary to many interventionists I think failed intervention in the past has created a need for intervention in the future and the longer we put this off the more intervention we will need and the more lives we will lose to pointless wars.\n\nIt's no secret that the war mongers in Washington, Westminster and Moscow have created a real mess in the world, and I think that now we need to correct the mess that has been made.\n\nTo provide a metaphor for this argument, imagine that you are building a lego tower with your young child, your older child knocks the tower down. You being a good parent decide to help rebuild the tower, then you can leave the tower once it is built and the child can do with it as you will\n\nWe need to be the good parents in the world\n\nSo, what kind of intervention are we talking about here?\n\nWell I personally don't believe any country should be the world's police man, it goes against national sovereignty. Instead I feel we should correct the mistakes we've made in the past and ensure peace after that\n\nFor example, past conflicts have lead to the Syrian Civil War and the rise of isis (but that's a story for another time), we need to take action to fix this before it devolves any further. Instead of supporting rebels that can easily radicalise and support radical terrorism, we should directly intervene. Yes it will be messy, but its more messy to indirectly intervene in order to not face the political consequences of intervention. We should initially take the land of isis and control that land to try and form a peace in Syria with a strong foothold giving us a strong negotiating position to end one of the real tragedies of our times.\n\nHowever not every intervention requires war: I think we should put troops into Libya to try and force both sides into negotiations and to try and end yet another battleground in the Middle East and North Africa; we should put troops into Yemen to create a DMZ and bring both sides to meaningful peace negotiations and we should also stay true to our commitments to build the ring road in Afghanistan to ensure that we can rebuild the real ground zero of Islamic Terrorism\n\nBut, is this not inconsistent with generally accepted principles of libertarianism? \n\nWell I'd like to begin by saying, being ideologically consistent isn't the most important thing in the world, it's what created the two party system which we all loathe and its what makes the world and our nations the messes they are. However I do believe these sorts of interventions can come exist with libertarian principles \n\nMost people who support Non-Interventionism believe that not getting involved in conflicts will ensure America/Britain etc don't face the consequences of such actions. But I believe its too late for that, we have already created the messes we must clear them up otherwise the consequences will only worsen\n\nWe as libertarians should not strive to isolate ourselves but to maintain our commitments, we should put right our wrongs. A Libertarian state must also protect the liberties of those in trouble and that is what these interventions would ensure. \n\nSo what would happen after these interventions, we isolate ourselves? \n\nNo, quite the contrary. We need to take our responsibilities seriously, we need to ensure we are a vocal member of the international community and we preserve the peace we will create. Humans are imperfect, we know this so we must be ready as a collective to protect the peace that will be as fragile as ever \n\nSo, what do you think? Am I a neocon loony? Or am I talking common sense, that we must right the wrongs of our past and make sure that peace is brought to the world? \n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I believe in Military Intervention, however I am also a Libertarian.

Why shouldn't the government do something like a bigger tax.

Also how is allowing a company to increase the price of a live saving drug ethical and should not be looked at the government first ? If someone can't afford it with a price raise then isn't that the company killing someone ? Sure I get not doing this with our current government.

So many of us have turned to the idea of gradual libertarianism, where we elect small government politicians and overtime we hope that we can further our libertarian values.\n\nWhat if I told you there was another option, an option that will be more effective and further libertarian values faster than under small government politicians?\n\nThere is another option, Compromise\n\nInstead of trying to force gradual change through (a compromise in itself), we should change our own ideas to reflect the best of both worlds instead of focusing on ideological consistency.\n\nToday I will be using the example of schooling.\n\nThere are 4 commonly cited options for schooling: Federal/Central Schooling, where a federal or central government completely runs the education system; Locally administered schools; Privatisation of the school system with vouchers; Complete privatisation\n\nAll of these have flaws however, what if we could take the benefits of both sides and create an education system that really worked\n\nHere is my suggestion\n\nSchools run for profit, local governments would set standards for these schools if they met them they could stay open, money would follow the pupil and there would be a form of Block guaranteed pay and a small proportion of performance based pay. These would be payed for by the government but administered by the private institutions that we would pay to run them\n\nSo let's break down why this compromise option is better\n\nFirstly, it keeps in tact the collective bargaining power that will keep costs lower than acting as an individual, like any product the more that is produce, the lower the costs for everyone. Education from poor individuals may be unattainable but the state ensuring education makes sure that everyone can get a good quality education\n\nSecondly, it utilises the efficiency and success of the private sector. Alongside school choice, schools would have ti compete for pupils , meaning that standards would constantly be on the up, a benefit for everyone. While the state has no reason to ensure competition, a private company has to be competitive in order to stay in business.\n\nThirdly, it allows for local governments to administer their education in the best possible way for students in that area. It allows schools to prepare people for jobs in their area, and their country so they can help the local and national economy.\n\nOverall this compromise would function better, but the same ideals can be applied to many issues, Healthcare and Prisons for example.\n\nOverall this could ensure the highest quality of life and could even be a step towards further progression of libertarian values. Either way whether you see it as the end goal or the stepping stone. It could hugely benefit the Libertarian movement.\n\nSo what do you think? Am I crazy or is this a genuine solution to many issues in the Libertarian movement? ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why we should compromise as libertarians.

When the branch chief for the SDWIS program, Jeff Bryan, needed more money, he had to make a convincing business case. His concern, however, was that the benefits for SDWIS were ultimately about public health, which he didn\u2019t know how to quantify economically. \n\nMark Day, deputy chief information officer and chief technology officer for the Office of Environmental Information, suggested that Bryan conduct an Applied Information Economics (AIE) analysis to measure the value. Day, who had spearheaded most of the AIE projects at the EPA to date, even said his office would split the cost. \n\n**Phase 0**\n\nIn Phase 0, the planning phase, we identified 12 persons who would represent the expertise of the EPA on SDWIS and its value. We scheduled five half-day workshops to take place within a three-week period. Jeff Bryan was considered a \u201ccore team\u201d person\u2014 one we would rely on to identify other experts and to be available for other questions. \n\n**Phase 1** \n\nIn the very first workshop (when the decision is defined), it became apparent that EPA managers were really not analyzing SDWIS as a whole, even though that had been my initial assumption. The system had been in place for years, and terminating it or replacing it was not seriously considered. The real dilemma was simply about the justification of three specific improvements to SDWIS: reengineering an exception tracking system, web-enabling the application for access by states, and modernizing the database. These three initiatives required initial commitments of about $ 1 million, $ 2 million, and $ 500,000, respectively, plus ongoing maintenance. We had to answer which of these improvements was really justified and, of those that were justified, the best priority. \n\nThe spreadsheet had to show three separate business cases, one for each of the proposed system modifications, each with its own benefits. The problem was how to compare the cost to health benefits. The Office of Management and Budget already required the EPA to produce economic arguments for any proposed environmental policy. The EPA had to compute costs of compliance and benefits to the public for each policy it wanted to enforce. Several such studies showed the economic impact of different types of the most common drinking water contamination. The EPA often resorted to a [willingness-to-pay (WTP) argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willingness_to_pay), but sometimes it used only workdays lost in calculating the cost of contamination. \n\nBy focusing on how SDWIS is supposed to help public health in the next two workshops, we were able to define a spreadsheet model that tied in the SDWIS modifications to an economic valuation of health benefits. The model had a total of 99 separate variables identified. For example, for web-enabled access for states, we estimated how much time is spent in certain activities, how much those activities would be reduced, and the impact on how much sooner violations of water safety regulations could be corrected. \n\nIn the last two workshops of Phase 1, we took all the experts through [calibration training](http://lesswrong.com/lw/hak/link_how_to_calibrate_your_confidence_intervals/) and asked for initial estimates of every variable in the model. The results from the calibration training showed that the experts were very well calibrated (i.e., 90% of real answers were within the stated 90% CI). Every variable in the model had some level of uncertainty, and some of the variables had very wide ranges. For example, one of the proposed benefits included an expected increase in the reporting rate of violations\u2014 not all water contamination gets reported. The increase was highly uncertain, so experts put a 90% CI of 5% to 55% on the reporting rate increase. \n\nThe spreadsheet computed a return on investment for each of the three modifications to SDWIS. At this point, we had a detailed model that showed the experts\u2019 current state of uncertainty. \n\n**Phase 2** \n\nIn Phase 2, we ran a [Measurements Value of information analysis (VIA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_measuring_methodology). Even though the ranges in all the variables expressed a lot of uncertainty, only one variable merited measurement: the average health effects of new safe drinking water policies. The entire purpose of SDWIS was to track contaminations better and to make corrections more quickly and efficiently. While the upper bound of potential health benefits for a single policy was on the order of $ 1 billion per year, there was also a chance the benefits could be lower than the cost of compliance for the policy. In other words, the economic benefits of these policies were so uncertain that the calibrated experts actually allowed for the possibility that the net benefits were negative. \n\nIf there is no net value to enforcing water regulations (i.e., value of the health impacts minus the cost of compliance), there is no benefit in enforcing the regulations better and faster. All of the uncertainties about state adoption rates of the technology, efficiency improvements, improved reporting rates, and the like turned out to have an information value of zero. All we had to do was reduce our uncertainty about the net economic benefits of drinking water policies. But the potential health benefits (i.e., the upper bounds) were very large compared to the small cost of the SDWIS upgrades. This put the threshold for the economic benefit measurement just barely above zero. In other words, what we really had to reduce uncertainty about was whether the net economic benefits of the drinking water policies were positive at all. We set out to reduce our uncertainty about that and that alone. \n\nSince many of the previous water policy economic analyses varied somewhat in the methods they used, we decided to start with a simple instinctive-Bayesian approach based on a more detailed review of all the economic analysis done to date. \n\nThe reason calibrated experts included the possibility of a negative net benefit for water policies was that, out of several economic analyses, one showed a negative economic impact for one particular water policy. On further review, it turns out that this particular economic analysis looked only at extremely conservative economic impacts of water contamination\u2014 basically, just workdays lost and the economic impact of the loss. However, most people would agree that being sick is worse than just losing a couple of days of wages. The other economic analyses included WTP values for avoiding illness in addition to lost wages. Every analysis that included WTP values for avoiding illness had, as a worst case, a slightly positive net benefit. \n\nAs a result, we created a more detailed breakdown of the individual benefits of each water policy. Then we showed a calibrated 90% CI for what the real benefits of the least beneficial policy would be if it included all the same benefits as all the other policies. It became obvious that there was virtually no chance that the net economic impact of water policies would be negative. We updated the model to show this information. The next VIA showed that no further measurement was required to justify any of the SDWIS modifications. \n\n**Phase 3** \n\nIn Phase 3, we ran a final Monte Carlo simulation on each of the three investments. With the reduced uncertainty about the economic benefits of the water policies, each one turned out to be a highly desirable investment. There was, however, a way to improve on the previously planned implementation schedule. The improved exception reporting had a very high potential return (the average ratio of benefits to costs was about three to one), but there was enough uncertainty that there was still a 12% chance of a negative return. The other two modifications had less than a 1% chance of a negative return. We plotted these three investments on the investment boundary (Chapter 11) we had already documented for the EPA. All three were acceptable, but not equally so. The reengineering of exception reporting had the highest risk and lowest return of the three. \n\nThe need for some ongoing metrics was also identified. Adoption rates by state users and how quickly the new system could be implemented were two of the more uncertain items. Therefore, they had \u201cresidual\u201d VIAs (i.e., they still had some value to measurement, but it was low). We recommended that the EPA should accelerate the other two investments and defer the reengineering of exception reporting. The adoption rates experienced in the other two investments would be considered before beginning development for the exception reporting, in case they were low enough to cancel development (unlikely, but possible). \n\n**Epilogue** \n\nMark Day got what he came to expect from an AIE analysis. He said, \u201cTranslating software to environmental and health impacts was amazing. The fact that software modules could be traced through a chain of events to some benefit to the public was assumed but never quantified. I think people were frankly stunned anyone could make that connection.\u201d He also notes the impact that quantitative analysis has on the decision process. \u201cThe result I found striking was the level of agreement of people with disparate views of what should be done. From my view, where consensus is difficult to achieve, the agreement was striking.\u201d To Day, the benefit of the VIA was another important part of the process. \u201cUntil then, nobody understood the concept of the value of the information and what to look for. They had to try to measure everything, couldn\u2019t afford it, and so opted for nothing. The number of variables quickly overwhelmed the ability to measure because they don\u2019t know what really matters,\u201d said Day. \n\nUnlike Day, Jeff Bryan had no exposure to the AIE process before this project. He said, \u201cI was the guy kicking and screaming coming into this AIE analysis. I didn\u2019t want to pull people away from what they were doing to do a study like this. But it turned out to be valuable.\u201d He was also initially skeptical about calibration, \u201cbut after going through the process, and seeing people respond to estimates, I could see the value of calibration.\u201d To Bryan, perhaps the most useful step was simply visualizing the connection between an information system and the goals of the program. \u201cThe chart [Exhibit 14.2] showed how SDWIS connected to public health and how to compute the benefits. I didn\u2019t think that just defining the problem quantitatively would result in something that eloquent. I wasn\u2019t getting my point across, and the AIE approach communicated the benefits much better. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I used the chart.\u201d Finally, and most important, Bryan followed through. \u201cWe followed every last recommendation\u2014 including the content and timing of recommendations.\u201d \n\nI have presented this example for two reasons: \n\n1. It is an example of how an intangible like public health is quantified for an IT project. I\u2019ve seen many IT projects dismiss much more easily measured benefits as \u201cimmeasurable\u201d and exclude them from the ROI calculation. \n\n2. This example is about what didn\u2019t have to be measured. Only 1 variable out of 99 turned out to require uncertainty reduction. The initial calibrated estimates were sufficient for the other 98. \n\nAs usual, the measurements that would have been considered without doing the VIA probably would have been some of the much lower-value measurements, such as costs and productivity improvement, and the bigger uncertainties, such as public health, would be ignored.\n\n**============END=============**\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Government Case Study: The Value of the System That Monitors Your Drinking Water (from the book, How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business)"}

I understand that it's a joke, but it is a valid point that is often said about capitalism which needs addressing. Specifically, the view is that capitalism creates all this fantastic wealth, but it inevitably only goes into the hands of the few. In order for the lower/working classes to benefit, this tendency must be reversed through state intervention (wage/price controls, regulations, etc.). I think this is a flawed way of thinking and it dangerously misunderstands the nature of inequality and how a free-enterprise system creates wealth for society.\n\nTo start, in every major civilization, from Ancient Mesopotamia to today, wealth has been concentrated in the hands of an elite few and nearly everyone was devastatingly poor. This isn't unique to capitalism. Before you blame free markets on all the woes in society, you have to show a time and place where that hasn't been the case. What economic system has produced a *preferable* distribution of wealth?\n\nIt's certainly not any system based on Marx, Engles, Lenin, or any of the \"intro\" socialist works that r/latestagecapitalism recommends. Regardless of how they labeled themselves (socialist, communist, \"People's Republics\", etc.), every single country that has tried to implement Marxist economic theory has had horrendous wealth inequality. High-ranking party members and their well-connected supporters lived far better lives than the average citizens. I can prove it: Name a single prominent, important Communist politician who starved to death during the Holodomor in Ukraine or the \"Great Leap Forward\" in China. Furthermore, considering that Venezuela and North Korea are both experiencing severe food shortages, why are they led by fat-fucks like the empanada-munching [Nicolas Maduro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktNwq7Ec7dU) and the porcine [Kim Jong-Un](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kim_Jong-un_at_the_Workers%27_Party_of_Korea_main_building.png). I guess some people really *are* just more equal than others?\n\nAnd before anyone plays the well-worn \"It wasn't real socialism\" card, I'd point out that they certainly thought it was at the time. Plus, if every time they try to implement it, they don't wind up implementing it, that seems like strong evidence that it doesn't work. \"Equality of Outcome\" is an impossible standard and should *not* be the goal of society. Every time it has been attempted, it has ended in catastrophe.\n\nNow, you might point to the Nordic countries or some other places in Western Europe as example of preferable economies. I think there's a strong argument for that, and there are a lot of interesting discussions to be had there. However, you should still recognize that these are *capitalist* economies that all rank *very* highly on various indexes of economic freedom. There might be *less* inequality than the U.S., but it's nowhere near *zero*. There are still rich and poor, although the poor happen to be doing fairly well. That's in part because they have a fairly robust, well-designed safety net. You could argue about the benefits of their system, but make no mistake: these are very wealthy countries because of capitalism. It's because they allow individuals to control their own money/property and engage in voluntary exchanges of goods and services.\n\nThis also explains why wealth has *exploded* in formerly-Marxist countries after they liberalize the economy. All over the world, *billions* of people have been vaulted out of absolute poverty in a few decades. If you want to have rising standards of living for the average citizens, you *must* have a market-based economy. The evidence for this is *overwhelming*.\n\nLastly, the libertarian position on wealth inequality is complicated and poorly understood. In many cases, inequality is good. Bill Gates became a billionaire, but he also enriched everyone else by developing affordable computers. But there are countless examples of *illegitimate* inequality, too. (Using tariffs/subsidies to protect politically-favored industries, lobbying for tax-loopholes that don't apply to competitors, and so on.) I suspect we're currently in a time with high levels of *illegitimate* inequality, but it's nearly impossible to parse out. But simply looking at how wealth is distributed doesn't say much.\n\n**TL;DR** I know this is a long, stupid response to a flippant joke, but this shit is important. I understand why a lot of people feel angry and resentful towards the system. There are *real* economic and social problems with todays society. There is corruption, inefficiency, and just plain unfair all over the place. But these are serious, complicated problems and they require real effort to find solutions. But to solve them, you need to understand how we got to where we are now. Fantasizing about \"seizing the means of production\" and redistributing the worlds riches according to your obviously noble, enlightened principles is incredibly destructive and will get us nowhere.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Libertarian thoughts on wealth inequality (In response to r/LateStageCapitalism and \"Libertarian Logic\")"}

Dylan Matthews goes on and on about how great the War on Poverty was and how it has had a lasting positive impact on society. The Post article includes a graph of the poverty rate between 1959 and 2012 and the trends in the graph are quite obvious, there is a very steep decline in poverty between 1959 and 1965 and after 1965, the poverty rate is roughly cyclical, down during boom years and up during recession years. It is astonishing to me because they claim that the War on Poverty was instrumental in the reduction of poverty and yet the steepest decrease in poverty seen in the entirety of the time surveyed, occurred before the introduction of the WoP. The free market was doing a terrific job bringing down poverty, then LBJ had to step and save the day, resulting in virtually no net reduction in poverty in half a century. The only way that I can see that anyone would be able to draw the conclusion that the War on Poverty conferred any benefit onto society was if they lied and claimed the WoP began in 1959, instead of 1964. It just astounds me because, unlike most times, the left is actually providing the very evidence that proves them wrong. It just goes to show that their feelings don't care about the facts.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"No, Washington Post, the War on Poverty hasn't done a damned thing."}

Like if a US shirt cost 5 dollars, and a Chinese shirt cost 3 dollars, the US government passes a tariff of like 3 dollars or more so the US shirt ends up being cheaper overall than the Chinese shirt, which in effect means the American citizen pays more money than they otherwise would have. This is clearly a negative.\n\nBut my question is in regards to another country putting a tariff on us, while we don't have one on them. Does this change anything? Are we supposed to do retaliatory tariffs as a result? I keep hearing how tariffs on 1 country therefore ends up with reciprocal tariffs put on them. But I never understood why.

What is the story of your political evolution? Or perhaps you have always identified as a libertarian?\n\nIn my case, when I started to become interested in politics I was basically a neo-conservative, supported Bush and the GOP in general during my high school years. I was very interested in economics, and understood early on that a free market was vastly superior to a planned economy. However, I also supported interventionism in the middle east, and joined the Marine Corps right out of high school. \n\nInterestingly enough, it was my experience in Afghanistan led me to conclude that military interventionism and neo-conservatism in general was not a great idea. Although I was a \"good\" Marine, it was during this time that I also started to develop some of my more anti-authoritarian views. Authoritarianism might be necessary in the military, but it was not a life I wanted to live forever. \n\nAfter two tours, I got out and began attending college. Here I almost got swept into the whole social democrat thing, but there was always this voice of reason in the back of my mind that told me trusting the government to make the problems of society go away was not the answer. As I went through college, I became more and more disgusted with the left-wing authoritarianism that has become so rampant on college campuses today, and started reading books regarding political economics. Beginning with Hayek, then Rothbard and Friedman, I finally found a political ideology that was consistent and seemed to be both socially tolerant and economically feasible. I started to identify as a libertarian a few years ago and haven't looked back!\n\nOf course, I have read quite a bit about other political philosophies since. I dabbled in anarchism, but the only type of anarchism that ever made sense to me was the black and gold flavor, not the traditional left wing variety. It seemed to me that anarcho-communism/syndicalism/etc was ultimately just plain old Marxism, with a less plausible roadmap. Today, I identify as a pragmatic libertarian, with sympathies towards the geolibertarians. \n\nAnyway, enough about my story. What led you to libertarianism? I would be very interested to hear how others got here!\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How did you come to identify as a libertarian?"}

Or even as a conservative/liberal, because the definitions of those terms are always changing and morphing, and there are always stigmas and archetypes attached.\n\nThe Left/Right paradigm is one of the tools of the elite who wish to keep us stupid and restrict the scope of political conversation to \"How can I impose my values and/or philosophy on others?\"\n\nLet's stick to the framework of the constitution, and stop identifying with these political parties who do nothing but pass more laws and increase the size of the state.\n\nI honestly think that there are tons of people that just tuned out Ron Paul's message of peace and liberty simply because he was a republican, and the stigma attached to that party.  They just were too loyal to team blue.\n\nThis red/blue thing needs to go.  All of us libertarians and constitutionalists need to get out of that mentality, or at least focus on putting our energy into another \"color identity\" in order to be taken more seriously and attract more people who need a color or team to cheer for.  maybe we can be \"Yellow\" in order to get more mass votes from team-minded people, ANYTHING is better than trying to identify as red or blue.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The Left/Right dichotomy illusion"}

Along the way, though, I noticed some discussions of society, economics, and general social structures that struck me as distinctly libertarian in nature.\n\nWhen it comes to how these societies structure themselves, it's remarkable how many libertarian principles seem to manifest naturally. These societies are usually very egalitarian, at least from a governing perspective. There's not a lot of top-down order in terms of who does what, when they do it, or how they go about it. Individuals usually cooperate, often without the need of coercion or force, to survive and function.\n\nTheir economy is often described as a \"gift economy.\" It's all structured around voluntary exchange, mutualism, and willful sharing. When they have more than they need, they share it among the tribe. When they need something from others, their tribe comes to their aid. They don't go to a chieftain, king, emperor, or authority figure. They work among themselves to survive in constantly changing conditions.\n\nThat's not to say everything about hunter/gatherer society is libertarian in nature. Most of these societies don't have a concept of private property or land ownership. Tools, resources, and even sexual partners are shared among the tribe. It's usually small and concentrated so it wouldn't be accurate to call it a socialist-style commune. But the key here is that it's built around voluntary exchange.\n\nThere are a lot of other insights I could cite, but I don't want to crowd this sub too much with such details. I would strongly encourage anyone with an interest in libertarian principles to do some research on how hunter/gatherer societies function. It doesn't just provide insight. It makes a compelling case that certain libertarian principles are consistent with some of the most fundamental manifestations of human society.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Libertarianism And Hunter/Gatherer Societies"}

The question looked something like this:\n\n&gt; This is an X board, so Y is probably very far away from most of your political viewpoints.  But as far off as Y is, their position is still one that many thinking people support.  Where do you find yourself agreeing with Y, or at least sympathizing with their thinking?\n\nI asked:\n\n* [r/progressive about Republicans](https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/839l4w/where_do_you_stand_the_most_with_republicans/)\n* [r/conservative about liberals](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/8311iq/where_do_you_stand_the_most_with_liberals/)\n* [r/liberal about conservatives](https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/830umw/where_do_you_stand_the_most_with_conservatives/)\n* [r/republican about Democrats](https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/839dpr/where_do_you_stand_the_most_with_democrats/)\n* [r/the_donald about Democrats](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/830ihx/where_do_you_stand_the_most_with_the_democrats/)\n* [r/democrats about Donald Trump](https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/830ezq/where_do_you_stand_the_most_with_donald_trump/)\n* [r/communism about libertarians](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/830bxe/where_do_you_stand_the_most_with_libertarians/)\n* [r/libertarian about communists](https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/8308tl/where_do_you_stand_the_most_with_communism/)\n\nMany people responded, and many of them did have some common ground with their political rivals, though they generally thought their rivals took things too far.  Based on the responses I got, here's some of what I learned:\n\n-----\n\n**Liberals** agreed with conservatives in many areas.  A number of people made and upvoted comments showing:\n\n* disdain for the concept of safe spaces, cultural appropriation, and college \"SJW stuff\"\n* that biology plays a sizable role in \"gender and racial differences\"\n* a pro-life position\n* opposition to investing in social programs that misuse resources\n* support for freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, due process\n* support for an energy policy using coal/oil/gas\n\n&gt; I generally find SJWs and their ilk just as far away from being liberal as people that are more customarily called conservatives.\n\n&gt; I agree with conservatives on certain economic issues...\n\n-----\n\n**Progressives** had some common ground with Republicans on the right to bear arms and the idea that excessive taxes can be harmful.\n\n&gt; I think Republicans are not completely wrong in many cases, but that their positions are exaggerated or extreme.\n\n-----\n\n**Donald Trump supporters** had many things to say about Democrats, but almost all of it found no common ground.  One person mentioned that they agreed with Democrats on marijuana legalization.\n\n&gt; ...I am finding it harder and harder to find common ground, as they keep going farther off the deep end...\n\n-----\n\n**Communists** mostly found no common ground with libertarians.  Some found common positions in:\n\n* opposing US military interventions\n* opposing the two-party system\n* favoring LGBT rights\n\nThen they banned me from r/communism without explanation.\n\n&gt; ...I can see how libertarians can develop leftist politics but as it stands their lack of understanding of economics prevents that.\n\n-----\n\n**Libertarians** found many areas of agreement with communists.\n\n* opposing US military interventions\n* the right to bear arms\n* aiming for a stateless society\n* strong workers' rights\n* opposition to fascism\n\n&gt; I agree with their ideal...but I recognize that [it] will never happen and that every attempt at bringing it about has resulted in tyranny.\n\n-----\n\n**Republicans** and **Democrats** did not respond at all.\n\n**Conservatives** did not get a chance to respond, as their moderators removed the post.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Results of asking about opposing political views"}

He has all the usual \"Libertarian punch list\" views:\n\n1. Taxation is theft\n2. Very limited government\n3. Stay out of my business\n4. Drugs and prostitution should be legal\n\nBut I feel there is more to Libertarianism than just spouting the logic.\n\nI firmly believe that the government welfare state needs to end.  But I also believe that the poor still need help.  Whether that help is food, or money, or clothing, job retraining, or just a decent job.  But if we don't want the government to help them, then we need to make sure they have opportunity provided by private individuals.  So I feel Libertarians are called by their very nature to be charitable.  Of course, they don't have to be.  But I would think the average individual realizes that those in need that are willing to do what it takes, deserve help.  So, if you're willing and able to work and have a good work ethic, you should have the opportunity to find and keep a job.  If you want to sit on the couch and watch game shows all day while you smoke a joint, you don't deserve anything.\n\nI think the best help for the poor is provided by private charities that have the power to turn away the lazy and unwilling and help those that need it.\n\nMy new family members opinion about the poor is basically \"F*ck 'em.  They're on their own.  You make what you can out of life.  I got here just fine on my own.  They can too.\"  To me that's more Republican thinking that Libertarian thinking.\n\nAnd my views on the environment are kind of at odds with his.  There are things I called \"shared resources.\"  These are things such as air and water.  We all share the same atmosphere.  To cause major pollution that contaminates the air, in my opinion, violated the NAP, especially if that pollution could cause physical harm to another individual.  You can't just go dump 10 55 gallon barrels of nuclear waste in a river and have everyone downstream get cancer and die.  That also violates the NAP.  His opinion is quite the opposite.  Nobody has the right to tell him what to do.  Well, in this case, you still need to face the consequences.  So, if you give 1,000 people cancer because you dumped drums, then there are consequences.  Everything you own could be taken from you and sold to pay for these people's cancer treatments.  Or they could round you up and just kill you for killing their family members with cancer.\n\nI guess the best way to sum up his beliefs is \"I want to do whatever I want, when I want to do it, and I fully expect to face no consequences for my actions, because I have the right to do whatever I want.\"\n\nThat, to me, is not Libertarianism.  That's just being a total asshole that's giving Libertarianism a bad name.\n\n\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Don't justify being a complete asshole by calling yourself a Libertarian."}

Below I will show some quick napkin math to just put it into perspective how low it is.      \n\nAccording to Wikipedia, there are 2.5Million surfers in Aus: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing_in_Australia.\n\nI will assume the average surfs 2 hours (actual time in the water) twice a month.\n\nAt current population there are only about 2 shark attack fatalities per year on surfers. This number is very for a number of reasons, one being active shark-observance technologies in popular surf spot.\n\nIt is 1 death per 60 million hours. For surfers.\n\nThe supposed extreme gun violence in the US (outside of gang-related violence) works out to actually only 1 death per ~350 million hours at a little under 3 deaths per 100,000.\n\nEven if you include the gang violence, you have 1 death for every ~90 million hours. \n\nBefore Australia's \"Port Aurthur Incident which transformed firearm policy in Australia in 1996,\" there were, in 1995, 2.6/100,000 firearm-related deaths. Today there are 1/100,000.          \n\nSo, that **difference of 1.6/100k translates to an improvement of saving 1 death per &gt;550 million hours of life** by removing guns.     \n\nwith a ban on surfing, **we could save at almost 10x that rate of killing efficiency, at 1 death per 60 million hours of life.**     \n\nLook, the point here is to illustrate **the magnitude of risk.**  This is not a perfect comparison, nor does that matter. The point is to simply explain **if you are worried about being a victim of gun violence, how much risk reduction can we hope for?**     \n\nTurns out the miniscule probability of shark attacks are, statistically, and on a per-hour-of-life basis, way, way scarier.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Quick Stats with Firearm Deaths and Shark Attacks in Australia"}

To give a context of who I am , I am from a sexually conservative society. I am curious about sexuality in liberal societies.\n\n* I would like arguments for or against sexually liberal society (non discouragement for pre-marital sex -teenage sex - swinger culture) vs moderately conservative society( discouragement of pre-marital sex , mated for life , strong belief in marriage institution) which would have best outcome for common good ?\n\n\n\n\n* How does the mating competition favour both genders? does it tip the scale of balance towards one gender ? [A believe the balance has shifted toward females with rise medical advancement like contraceptive because earlier a women had to choose her mate carefully as unlike male once she is pregnant she could not reproduce for an year which means a female has to be choosy where as a male has to reproduce with as much female to increase the chances of passing on his linage , however with the contraceptives this disadvantage for women is removed. since a women's biological directives seek her to find best of the male who probably represent small percentage of male population , which means there would always be a pie of males who would never get laid as likely as females [alpha males having multiple female partners over the course of his lifetime] in  it encourage rise of alpha male societies , with a large bunch of beta-males most likely virgins ending up with non-virgin partners .The above stated ones are merely my own hypothesis I welcome people to dismantle or support it so I can recalibrate my opinions  ]\n\n\n\n* Does the concept of serial monogamy exist ? ( constant divorces and remarriages)\n\n\n\n* does broken marriages result in broken families with bad developmental outcomes for kids ? ( step-dad molesting , child poverty etc.) I had mentioned broken marriages because divorce seem to be more common in western societies. The society I am from believe in marriage for life at-least that's what the society encourages or coherces them to do .\n\n\n* I have also read that a phenomenon called cuckold ( a father forced to raise his non-biological offspring without himself knowing about it ) seems to have higher occurrences in western liberal societies ? Does this phenomenon even exist ? if it exist doesn't it encourage alpha male behaviour ? \n\n\n* What does the act of sex means for people of liberal societies ? is it simple like a kiss , handshake or something complex and emotionally connecting that has to be shown to only people whom they would believe to have relationship for life?\n\n\n\nPS- I know the lot of above question seems like an accusation against sexually liberal societies , But that's not my intend I genuinely like to learn about the merits and demerits of the sexually liberal society . I been raised in a conservative family so I might have some misconception that may reflect in above question , if that's the case please correct me. I am strong believer in individual rights , but I also believe set of rules has to be set in place for society to function without chaos. However when I think about sexuality as both of these philosophy that I hold dear collides it creates a paradox that I cant make sense. So I believe by listening to your answers I can come to the right conclusion about sexually liberal societies myself.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I would like to know the context of sexuality / concept of sex in western liberal societies ?"}

Full stop. He **fails to understand the opioid crisis is a very complicated public health concern that needs a levelheaded pragmatic approach.** In a Senate drug hearing in April 2016, Sessions commented \"When you see something like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country, the last thing we should be doing is encouraging people.\" *referring to relaxed cannabis legislation*\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; **This is a three dimensional game of chess, and Sessions is playing checkers.**\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt; Jeff Sessions should focus on how Congress crippled the DEA's ability to fight the opioid epidemic. Instead he tramples upon states' rights and recreational marijuana laws. 64,000 Americans died last year from opioids. None have died from THC. In fact, the data clearly lays out that medical marijuana is associated with a 36% drop in opioid abuse rates and nearly a 25% reduction in overdose fatalities.\u201d\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n&gt; So our new policy is to reverse course, ignore what we collectively have learned and continue to lock up those with minor cannabis possession offenses?

If that same $3.6B could go toward the opioid epidemic, it would save many lives. How many lives will be saved spending the $3.6B on cannabis law enforcement? Zero!, because their lives weren't at risk to begin with. *We were headed in the right direction, certainly a long road ahead, but still the right direction.

{"author":"Phaelios","created_utc":1521533615,"num_comments":1,"score":0,"selftext":"I'm stuck. I'm a fiscal centrist. The left is too left and doesn't think outside the box. And Republicans is a fuck no, since they're socially conservative and treat fiscal conservatism as \"steal from the poor and give to the rich so that they can deregulate everything at the top with lobbyists and other lawyers but regulate the shit out of small businesses and startups so that they don't have any new competition, deregulate working hours so they can treat people like slaves.\" Republicans aren't fiscal conservatives. They have a facade of fiscal conservatism behind a sick, twisted system that serves the people who pay for their elections (which, by the way is a gap that Libertarians NEED to fill). Anyways, despite that, I am still a centrist:\n\nThe problem with the liberal approach is that it will make us like Europe. Liberals LOVE to point to Europe as an idealistic model of what the U.S. could be like. On a daily level, many countries, especially Scandinavian ones, enjoy a lot of things like easy access to healthcare and a generally higher quality of living.\n\nWhat Europe is totally missing is the breakneck innovation and global financial dominance that comes with unregulated markets mixed with an influx of highly intelligent immigrants. SpaceX. Microsoft. Google. Companies started in America, not all of them by natives - but immigrants who are citizens and welcomed in. That is Darwinism being used as a *tool* - and at its finest. Darwinism is a *tool,* not a *value.*\n\nI call happiness a value. I call freedom a value. I don't call tractors a value. I don't call firearms a value. *For those last two items, they contribute to other values, but they are not values in and of themselves.*\n\nFor the problems of fiscal conservatism. Smart fiscal conservatives are quick to point out that free markets are an emergent system, which is undoubtedly true. The conclusion that they draw from this premise, however - that unregulated free markets are the best thing for the economy and the country in general - is contentious.\n\nSome people literally are just too dumb to support themselves. Some people's brains just aren't capable. A lot of people. Millions of people. The bottom 15% is so dumb that working at McDonalds is a profoundly challenging. They need jobs that are *so simple* that it's like most people trying to learn physics. Many of them depend on other relatives simply to support themselves.\n\nLiberals are too fast to shift the blame for their circumstances to others. Fiscal conservatives are too fast to shift the blame to the *sufferer.* I will say this: liberals need to understand that taking responsibility for things that are even seemingly not your fault actually does help you move forward with your life. They also need to stop underestimating how helpful implementing this lesson into society actually would be. You find that there's always something you could have improved on or done better. [Jocko Willing does a good job of illustrating this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljqra3BcqWM) \n\nBut, that's not the whole picture. It's not someone's fault if they simply don't understand these lessons. You can imagine the advantage that loving parents, a high natural drive and high intelligence creates. Statistics don't lie. No matter what your beliefs are, people who are smarter, or who showed a strong innate drive as preschoolers do better in life overall. Smart, naturally driven people get scholarships. They pay little to nothing in student loans. They have an easier time implementing basic advice that takes discipline.\n\nAnd, these people should be rewarded because if you don't reward this behavior, people won't work. But that doesn't mean that you should *exponentially* punish others for failing to contribute. As far as I'm concerned, laws should protect borrowers more than lenders because lenders are likely to have more resources to manage risk. Exponential reward is a juicy prospect, and absolutely should be a part of our economy.\n\nBut, there is an effect that goes beyond exponential reward. If there was ever something that is just pure, dumb luck, it's the beneficiaries of the [King Effect.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_effect) A few billionaires are significantly richer than all other billionaires. And billionaires are significantly richer than the vast majority of super rich people. This is trillions of dollars. I think that this subset of people ought to be subject to special rules - winners rules. The same philosophy that drives antitrust laws should drive regulations involving these individuals - to protect the freedoms of the rest of us. You don't have nearly as much of a say in things as Jeff Bezos does, or Peter Thiel or Warren Buffett. You could do a lot to the face of global politics in such a position. It's just this kind of centralized power that the libertarian part of my personality deeply rejects and fears.\n\nThese people are a natural consequence of free markets, and eventually they will kill free markets because they have the purchasing power to do so. It doesn't matter what you think, it doesn't matter what your ideals are. Washington is for sale, and it's deregulation that allowed it.\n\nTaxing these people in their own special bracket - the hyper-rich bracket. But conversely, I'd also decrease taxes everywhere else - including on already fairly wealthy people. Earning 300k a year is a pretty sweet goal to work towards, and it seems achievable with hard work. But, it just sounds so, *so* much shittier to make 300k a year and keep 195k.\n\nSo, I'd say largely I'm a fiscal conservative in the middle, but a fiscal liberal on dealing with the extremes and creating an emergent system through evidence-based economics that benefits the most people and safeguards the U.S.'s place as the world's greatest innovator and dominant country financially.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"A case for fiscal CENTRISM."}

In NYC, especially in the 19th and 20th century, you hear a different language as you go from neighborhood to neighborhood. At one point, German almost became the most spoken language in the entire country.\n\nSo, how did a nation made up of so many different ethnic groups with different culture, traditions and language became ''American''? How was the American identity created?\n\nWas it the schools teaching English and American identity? How do you teach American identity? \n\nMany people cite the sub-saharan African countries as being unstable because of being too diverse, but diversity can't be the reason, because America is probably more diverse than they are. It has to do with common institutions, stable government and lack of political involvement in the society, i.e. people rely on the market rather than on political mechanisms, but i want to know other than schools teaching the same language, what other ''uniform standards'' was Milton Friedman talking about?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"What did Milton Friedman mean by ''uniform set of standards, institutions and ideas'' being necessary for preserving variety and diversity within a society?"}

Full stop. He **fails to understand the opioid crisis is a very complicated public health concern that needs a levelheaded pragmatic approach.** In a Senate drug hearing in April 2016, Sessions commented \"When you see something like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country, the last thing we should be doing is encouraging people.\" *referring to relaxed cannabis legislation*\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; **This is a three dimensional game of chess, and Sessions is playing checkers.**\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt; Jeff Sessions should focus on how Congress crippled the DEA's ability to fight the opioid epidemic. Instead he tramples upon states' rights and recreational marijuana laws. 64,000 Americans died last year from opioids. None have died from THC. In fact, the data clearly lays out that medical marijuana is associated with a 36% drop in opioid abuse rates and nearly a 25% reduction in overdose fatalities.\u201d\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n&gt; So our new policy is to reverse course, ignore what we collectively have learned and continue to lock up those with minor cannabis possession offenses?

If that same $3.6B could go toward the opioid epidemic, it would save many lives. How many lives will be saved spending the $3.6B on cannabis law enforcement? Zero!, because their lives weren't at risk to begin with. *We were headed in the right direction, certainly a long road ahead, but still the right direction. I am genuinely worried where this seismic shift in drug policy may take us.*\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n&gt; **We cannot ignore the fact that drug abuse is a behavioral problem rather than a law-enforcement problem \u2014 much less a federal law-enforcement problem.** Like other social ills stemming from bad behavior, the drug problem is best solved at the state and local level with education, treatment and support. **This new or 'old,' direction will flood our prisons, further enrich cartels and the drug trade, increase violent crimes all while keeping the addicted sick.**\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt; *It may be the most overused clich\u00e9 of all time. ..... but it certainly applies here.* **The definition of Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. - Einstein**\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt; * [**We Can't Arrest Our Way out of Addiction**](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/civil-wars/articles/2017-11-30/jeff-sessions-new-war-on-drugs-is-the-wrong-way-to-fix-the-opioid-crisis)\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n&gt; * [The War on Drugs Is an Abject Failure.

I want to discuss one of them now. \n\nLibertarians are against all barriers to trade, so lets look at a simplified global market with one product. Simplifying markets to one product is extremely common in economic textbooks so if you are going to dispute the premise you should explain why it doesn't work here.\n\nSo imagine you have 2 countries that produce oranges and nothing else.  Country B has a libertarian government. Country A has a protectionist one. At the beginning A and B both produce and export oranges to each other and lets assume there is no comparative advantage favoring either country's production.\n\nIf country A's government suddenly subsidizes its orange exports,  nobody will buy country B's oranges because they are more expensive.  Country B's orange industry collapses and all its workers are unemployed. Because they are unemployed now none of the workers from country B can afford to buy oranges from either A or B.  Now country A has an oversupply of oranges because its exports are zero. the A government responds by ending the subsidies and a large percentage of workers are laid off in country A.  So now we have a situation where country A has high unemployment and a small orange industry with warehouses full of oranges with nobody to buy them.  Country B has 100% unemployment and is in ruins.  The market will correct itself but that will take years. Millions will die in B and millions suffer in A.  And in the end after the market corrects the 2 countries will be right back where they started.\n\nIf country B applied tariffs to A oranges after A begins dumping, then I think the outcome would be less bad. \n\nSo why am I wrong?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why I think libertarians are wrong on trade"}

It intrigued me because it allows communities to decided for themselves what they think the best way to defend there children is.

However, if another town believes that to secure our freedom, the right to arms does not need to be infringed (and that there are other effective ways to treat this issue), than they may chose that.\n\nIs any of this possible?

I'm here to explain what the simulation is about and, hopefully, convince some of you to come join the community. If you're interested in such a simulation, here's what we have to offer:\n\nOnce someone enters the server, they'll immediately be given the option to join a political party or remain an independent. There are four current political parties: the Green-Democratic Party, Libertarian Party, Monarchist Party, and Radical Leftist Party. Users also have the option to create their own political party if they can gather enough members to do so.\n\nOnce they've chosen a party, they're allowed into the various text channels of the main server and the party's individual server. Once that's done, they can begin to participate in the simulation. You can get involved with party politics by running for a leadership position or obtaining one of they various jobs that each party has open. You can also apply for a federal cabinet position or even begin working for a press organization that covers events within the simulation.\n\nAlso, elections are coming up, so members will have the ability to run for office, participate in debates, create a platform, and, eventually, vote. If elected to Congress, you'll be assigned to two committees and will be able to write and vote on legislation. We actually recently had a government shutdown scenario where Congress had to pass a budget by a specific deadline to avoid a shutdown that would have implemented negative vote modifiers for the upcoming federal election. You can even work in the private sector. For example, you could create your own non-governmental organization or join SpaceX, which exists in this simulation.\n\nAs you can see, there's quite a bit going on in this simulation. We're an ever-growing simulation that will only continue to grow and become more active as time goes on. If you're interested, here's a link: https://discord.gg/zKQ5v3y\n\nIf you have any questions about AGS, feel free to ask in the comments or through private message.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"AGS - An American Government Simulation"}

It makes sense to me, in that aggression or coercion is a big no-no, in any form. However, I do feel there is a need for a police force, or at least a governing body for that. Rothbard's answer to that is privatization, which I agree with, but I feel as if there would need to be some form of oversight, which leads me to minarchism. \n\nI have my problems with that as well. Minarchism has a small government, which I believe will always lead to a larger government. I don't believe that a government will stay 'pure to the cause' as it will always try to expand its control. People in power like to stay in power, and to expand their power. So, m question is basically this: what, in you opinion, would be a good intermediate stage between these two outlooks? Things like court systems, police force and army make sense to me to be federal, but how do we prevent government overreach?\n\nEdit: I apologise if I got any terms wrong, I'm not new to libertarianism, but I am new to posting and discussing it in any depth.

I.e. public funding probably spends about ten times as much as necessary.\n\nIt costs us - and likewise taxpayers - 40 bucks to buy bleach in our lab. It's just fucking Clorox that you can buy at the grocery store. But to buy it with grant money it costs an additional 36 dollars.\n\nSpace probes cost billions of dollars. Billions. The rockets - the overpriced rockets - that launch them cost a tenth of the actual probe.\n\nWhy? Because the government strictly controls every facet of it. Ask a democrat or a republican and they'll say it's necessary to protect taxpayer dollars. In reality it creates waste.\n\nLibertarians have something that's severely underrepresented in politics: letting people actually be free to do what they need to do. I feel like libertarians are the lowest on the control freak spectrum. Republicans and democrats? Yikes.\n\nSo, since Trump is a giant frothing lunatic and is damaging the Republican party, and since Libertarians are more popular amongst younger generations - generations whose relevance is getting a foothold, along with rising social liberalism (it needs to be more libertarian liberalism than it is right now), Libertarianism is in a position to inject itself into politics in a more major way.\n\nI doubt that I'll ever be a hard core liberal, libertarian or anything, but I do want the face of politics to change into something that's more balanced and more effective.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Libertarians should fill the vaccuum that is being created."}

In my opinion, race and smell have an extremely strong correlation. Why is there a different smell in different races? To figure this out, I am going to explore why race exists in the first place. In my opinion, race began as combination of environment and genetics created race in the first place. Races from hot climates like Africa have the strongest smell, as the blacks that survived in Africa had to perspire a lot to maintain homeostasis, so natural selection caused the smelly blacks to survive and pass on the enlarged sweat glands to their children. Why do blacks even exist in the first place? It\u2019s because of the sun, and natural selection. Those with more melanin in their skin are much more resistant to the hot sun than their white counterparts, so the darker skinned people survived and passed on their genes to their darker skinned children, while the white people burnt up and died in the hot African sun, or they moved to a colder environment like Europe. \n\nReal life historical evidence to support my theory-\n\nIt is widely accepted that the first humans originated from Africa, and then migrated to the rest of the world. My theory would explain why The lighter skinned people moved to Europe, where as the darker skinned people either stayed in Africa, or moved to other hot climates like the land that is the Middle East, South America, or India.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"/u/negronation105\u2019s theory on the existence of race, and the correlation between race and smell"}

{"author":"JdaVoCap","created_utc":1522003824,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"Howdy! \n\nAs an avid conspiracy theorist/fact-er for most of this user's lyf, and being a staunch individualist (the meaning of \"right-wing\", which is lost to most and one reason this user doesn't like labels, because the facilitate dehumanization) as well as a student of history (real history btw, getting through gummit indoctrination camps' BS for almost two decades was rough), this user has become increasingly concerned with how cyclical history has become and how society is reverting to a past era. The year may not be the \"current year\", but more akin to 1919 Europe with one group of pro-global-group collectivists going so far with neo-progressivism that the answer is merely a smaller group of more nationalistic classical progressive collectivists, with individualists and personal liberty, responsibility, and reason being public enemies for both of these monsters, like KingK Vs. G'Zila, whoever wins this triple threat match, as it were, the championship can change hands without being pinned. One may be a 'roided up mammal with common features and the other a reptilian invader capable of much worse, but choosing between the \"lesser of\" is still choosing one's own destruction.\n\nThe push-pull factors are certainly there and this user does feel them and sympathize with much of the goals of preserving what is under attack (straight, white, heterosexual males, meritocracy, and history/culture) but preservation doesn't need to equate to supremacy and as a principled person, opposed to the more willy-nilly pragmatic, how people go about this quest is as important as undertaking it at all, because if not perfect, if it is botched, the proverbial pendulum swing back the other way will be something of the worst this planet has ever seen. People have several \"friends\", their names Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How, How has been worked to exhaustion and Why has been kicking rocks outside in the rain waiting for someone to play with.\n\nFor how some libertarian-minded people left and joined the \"ethno-crowd\" (don't like using \"alt-right\" because it's a media creation and yet to be defined, originally this user thought it enveloped a great deal of actual right-wingers across the political spectrum models most use, opposed to mainstream neocon excuses of conservatives, but at the end of the day it's still a label and the only label people should identify as, at least with primacy over subscribing to any other belief is: human being. It is what separates gullible ideologues from skeptical idealists, without needing to become a cynical realist) this user posits this question: How different are the ten-feet-higher crowd from the gun-grabbers? Both focus on the Mr. How and not Mr. Why, have no faith in humanity or the ability to grow and handle a person's own business as this user, as a human being with an ethical-deist-mindset, is the natural progression or evolution \"the universe\" wishes upon humanity.\n\nThis listener was severely disappointed in the recent \"debate\" (bleh, this user despises that term and what it has become because it's akin to the 440 hz mind-control of dominating one's mind and \"winning\", meaning arguments get thrown out the window and it becomes about \"performance\" and time limits and crowd reactions in the vain of this user's favorite sport...professional wrestling) between one Mr. L R and one Ms./Mr. L S at Anarchapulco 2018 which was not only a horrible choice for either side but structured horribly, without a moderator, and horrible crowd behavior (LAY OFF THE SATIVA, SWITCH TO INDICA BOIZ!) and horrible performances by two people this listener otherwise has feelings for, such as admiration and respect, the latter of which took a hit that day. One relied too heavily on emotional appeals in too brusque a manner, serving what should've been a proverbial gormet meal on a trashcan lid, while the other was a few fries short of a hapymeal on a paper plate. This happened likewise in other discussions that go south in a handbasket such as on Mr. A \"Racewarski's\" streams where what should've been easy-pickings or at least a healthy intellectual discussion ends up as pseudo-internet-bloodsports and an ambush to the tune of 5-on-1, such as the one with a certain space mammal. \n\nSo why is this listener here? \n\nThis listener has seen enough to figure out some of the main points of contention and pitfalls of the contending sides and has been formulating viable alternatives to rash actions such as \"the wall\" when it comes to borders and why such an endeavor will not work and is on here to see if anyone else had anything different to add before this listener makes more of a final push on such a piece, just to get a sit-rep on the crowds at-large as well to such an attempt at peace in a full set of ethos, logos, and pathos appeals aimed at the socio-political factor, the economical factor, the security factor, split into both the more visceral aspects and the race-mixing parts of purported genocides, and to wrap things up in a nice \"bow\", the ethics of it all. This listener feels this user can deliver a decent attempt at least off the top of the head at any given time, without notes or getting drunk on vodka the night before, showing disrespect to the crowd at-large that should not be seen as enemies when lyf is like a F F RPG game or sci-fi space opera with an ensemble cast of ruffians saving the realm from annihilation or risk doing the enemy's work for 'em in a purity spiral that does not need to happen. Not asking that everyone sux each other off, but just not destroy each other either.\n\nAnarchy allows for the healing of such wounds and prevention of further ALL WHILE SAVING FACE, as opposed to the ethno-wall crowd only making things worse, perhaps not now, but for future generations of which the present is borrowed from.\n\n/rant /attemptatreason Thanks for reading.

{"author":"GShermit","created_utc":1522055243,"num_comments":13,"score":0,"selftext":"I\u2019ve watched two town halls and now we just had the \u201cMarch to Save Our Lives\u201d After the Parkland shooting children got vocal about school shootings and have been leading the discussion. Mass shootings aren\u2019t new to America and it seems every time we have one we get indignant, demand change, point fingers and forget about it until next time. I\u2019ve never subscribed to the old adage that a child should be seen but not heard so I don\u2019t mind kids speaking their mind. I do get angry when I see people use kids for an agenda. \n\n\u201cKids say the darndest things\u201d, they\u2019re cute and look so innocent, and their emotions wrap your heart around their finger.  Along with that innocence comes gullibility and children are easy to deceive. Children\u2019s emotions are still new and developing. Strong emotions like fear can be overwhelming. \n\nSo when I see children who are being told they have to march for their lives, when the odds of a child dying in a school shooting is about 7,000,000 to 1, it annoys me. Now this world isn\u2019t a safe place and up until a few hundred years ago children reaching adulthood wasn\u2019t near as common as it is today. Even 30-40 (oh alright 50) years ago, as a kid, it wasn\u2019t uncommon to have a kid fall into a corn picker or roll over a tractor. Child labor is still a common practice among the poorer people of the world. Most Americans are privileged enough not to have to depend on child labor. American kids still have some dangers, disease, transportation, accidents, suicide and homicides all kill children at relatively high percentages. \n\nAt the march I saw children (and some adults) on the verge of hysteria because a child has a 1 in 7,000,000 chance of being shot in school? On the other side I also saw a father make a monkey out of his hero son by editing emails. I\u2019m greatly annoyed and if you\u2019re using kids for your agenda;\n&gt;\u201cIt were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.\u201d Luke 17:2\n\nNow for all the kiddies here\u2019s some truth from Crazy Uncle Hermit;\n\nGuns are dangerous and hand guns are the most dangerous. Some hand guns are called \u201cautomatics\u201d. They\u2019re actually a semi-automatic and eject a spent cartridge then load a new one. Semi-autos fire one round with every trigger squeeze. Many rifles are also \u201csemi-autos\u201d, scary looking semi-autos are called \u201cassault weapons\u201d (I guess because they\u2019re so scary) an assault rifle (machine gun) is a military rifle that can fire multiple rounds at every trigger squeeze; they are illegal without special permit and background check. \n\nGirls and boys, guns are the most dangerous tool you\u2019ll ever use but the Constitution says, owning a gun, is a right just like free speech and voting. That means there\u2019s lots of guns around so you should have your parents make sure you\u2019re educated properly.\nAll of our constitutional rights have some limits and because guns are dangerous not everyone can own them. Now we know good background checks work because machine guns aren\u2019t used in crimes. The ATF has a form that everyone uses to legally buy a gun but too many people slip through the cracks. The government agencies that are responsible make mistakes and sometime laws aren\u2019t enforced and scary people end up buying guns. \n\nNow boys and girls some people are scary and they hunt the most undefended prey they can find because they\u2019re cowards (remember how the lions don\u2019t attack bulls with big horns?). So we need trained people with guns to protect you at school. Some areas may not have enough money to afford police so some teachers and principals may have to be trained, to carry guns. Now years ago we trained airplane pilots to carry guns just like police and there\u2019ve been no problems that I know of and I\u2019m sure your teachers are just as capable as pilots. Many teachers have already shown their courage and willingness protect. \n\nSo you might ask why don\u2019t we get rid of guns? Well you have to remember owning guns is a constitutional right. We can use background checks and enforce the laws to keep guns away from those that have no right to them but we have to do better. Our law enforcement agencies have had to admit, numerous times, how the rules weren\u2019t followed and the wrong people got guns. If we can limit the amount of ammunition one person can shoot without reloading we can limit the amount of mass killing. Limiting magazine sizes also works for all guns not just the scary \u201cassault weapons\u201d. \n\nSo girls and boys let\u2019s recap;\n\nImproved education and mental health\n\nArmed guards at all the schools.\n\nBetter background checks and enforcement of gun laws.\n\nLimit magazine size.\n\nMost important, you\u2019ve got to pay attention because even though we\u2019re privileged enough to live in America we still have a few things that eat stupid people, who run around hysterically.  \n\n\n\nhttp://www.psychlawjournal.com/2013/01/school-shootings-what-are-odds-part-iii.html     \n\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"And a Child Shall Lead Them...\""}

It is therefore difficult for me to believe that this does not represent the general consensus of Reddit as a whole. While I'm sure there are small strongholds of free speech fundamentalists on this website, the thread I have linked here has stripped most of my hopes that reddit can ever be a symbol of freedom on the internet. \n\n\n**When will we understand** that we cannot regulate ourselves into prosperity? At the very least, the market of ideas must be a free one. I feel as if I have fooled myself into believing reddit-as-a-whole would never take such an open stance against freedom. I have been on reddit for half a decade, and personally never saw such an open opposition to freedom of the press like this on a subreddit as public as r/worldnews. While the political attitudes of the subs that typically hover in the r/all domain have always been fairly predictable, repetitive, and authoritarian, I always felt that deep down reddit cherished free speech and freedom of the press, even if their political bent never quite lined up with mine. But I've been duped. \n\n\n**Here is just one example of Reddit's Orwellian stance on the freedom of the press. Currently at 506 upvotes:** \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8787jz/prime_minister_shinzo_abe_wants_to_repeal_a/dwawsr5/\n\n\n**There's also this genius, 200+ upvotes:** \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8787jz/prime_minister_shinzo_abe_wants_to_repeal_a/dwaxohl/\n\n\n**Another redditor implying that de-regulation of the press takes from one political party's freedom of speech:** \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8787jz/prime_minister_shinzo_abe_wants_to_repeal_a/dwb3e9q/\n\n\n**Oh the irony:**\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8787jz/prime_minister_shinzo_abe_wants_to_repeal_a/dwb6vx3/\n\n\nAs a side note, a particularly disturbing trend in this thread (and across the site) is the attitude expressed towards reddit's enemy-of-the-state Fox News, and the failure of anyone to criticize MSNBC. While I have felt that reddit's disdain for Fox News is often justified, their critiques typically morph into an irrational hatred masquerading as rhetoric-at-best, and often times there is no masquerade at all. And criticisms of MSNBC have yet to make any substantial appearance on this site whatsoever. \n\nSeeing as how r/worldnews has &gt;18 million readers and maintains 30,000 readers at any one time,  I will stand by my claim that Reddit, across the board, is against freedom. \n\n*Edits for formatting","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Reddit Openly Admits to Opposing Freedom of the Press"}

It seems as though the \"March for our Live\" - ers want to have all their changes implemented at the federal level. But, could all of that really be done there?\n\nArticle I., Sec. 8, Clause 3\n\n&gt; [The Congress shall have Power] To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;\n\n10th Amendment:\n&gt; The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\nTo summarize: the ICC gives Congress the authority to make laws relating interstate and international commerce. Nothing more. The 10th Amendment goes further, declaring that any power not given to the federal government are for the states and/or the people. Congress cannot regulate intrastate commerce and also cannot force states to make laws that enforce federal laws.  States cannot be forced into participation with federal programs. States cannot be forced to run background checks on people purchasing firearms (Prinitz v. US and NY v. US). Every firearms law in the books at the federal level only regulates the sale, manufacture and transfer of firearms across state lines. Weapons that stay within a state are regulated only by said state.  However, this does mean that any firearms dealer who sells a weapon that was transferred from another state is required to conduct a background check on a purchaser in accordance with the Brady Law and the Gun Control Act of 1968.  Again, because of Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce.  Furthermore, if you read the provisions in the Gun Control Act and the Brady Law, you'll find many of the same stipulations as people have been calling for: ineligibility for the mentally ill, waiting periods, limits on automatic weapons, etc.  But again, it only applies to businesses transferring weapons between states, and the states can't be forced to enforce federal law.  I guess if the feds wanted to they could reduce funding appropriations for states that don't implement stricter gun control laws (already legal as Congress has the authority to appropriate money and SCOTUS has viewed this practice as an act of Interstste Commerce that doesn't infringe on the 10A).  But aside from that, it is my conclusion based on what I wrote above that stricter gun laws can only be done at the state level. I think people have forgotten about a little thing called dual-soverignty; the right of the states to govern themselves.  We've seen this in action with some states having strict gun laws and those not so much.  This is based on the need of the populace within that state. That is the intention that was set out by the Framers.  Don't let the federal government become too powerful.  The states know their people better anyways.

{"author":"CheeseForPeas","created_utc":1522101700,"num_comments":19,"score":13,"selftext":"This is usually one of the first things said in gun control debates. And even if that were true, that doesn\u2019t nullify someone\u2019s right to own one. But it\u2019s also completely false. Some regular citizens use their AR-15 as a tool. A crucial tool in their regular lives.\n\nA buddy of mine told me about his uncle who lives on a farm. He has chickens and cows and also multiple large gardens where he grows tomatoes and all sorts of other things. Anyone who owns a farm understands that a significant percentage of the work is protecting your crops and livestock from other animals. \n\nI\u2019m not entirely certain where he lives cause it\u2019s my friend\u2019s uncle not mine, but I know that it\u2019s somewhere in Texas. But wherever it is, wild boars and coyotes get really bad out there apparently. He\u2019s had his entire chicken coup slaughtered by coyotes before. And boars come by almost daily to eat the things in his garden and also tear up and ruin the beautiful landscape of his farm that he\u2019s worked hard on to make it look good. I think you can see where I\u2019m going with this.\n\nBasically he\u2019s had an AR for a little while now and it\u2019s made his work a lot easier. Cause another thing that anyone with livestock knows, you can\u2019t just scare off the predators. I mean you CAN. But they\u2019ll just come back later on when you are asleep or not around. If you have a pack of coyotes that keep killing your chickens, you pretty much have to kill them. You have to kill as many as you can and It\u2019s perfectly legal to do so. You have to make sure those coyotes understand that coming around your farm isn\u2019t worth the losses to the pack. Same with the boars. And boars are much worse cause they are bigger and more dangerous and also in much greater numbers than coyotes at times. Killing the boars is not only necessary to protect you garden but also your family. And also they are bad for the environment as well as being just mean ugly fat bastards.\n\nHe\u2019s claimed that the boars and coyotes came by less and less frequently until they stopped showing up at all. But he says new families of boars have started showing up and he has to teach them the same lesson as the others. His farm is where he makes more than half of his income. If his right to own an AR-15 was somehow taken away, he\u2019d struggle to defend his property from wild animals. And he\u2019d lose lots of chickens and lots of crops that way. And that\u2019s his money so he\u2019d potentially lose his farm and have to find a different job most likely. \n\nSo it isn\u2019t true that NOBODY needs an AR. Cause I know of one guy who really really does haha. ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"\u201cNobody needs an AR-15\u201d"}

All people are racist due to our tribal nature, which is shown in studies of people having significantly less empathy if one of a difference race than themselves is in pain. Race mixing is a Marxist propaganda designed to divide and destroy the moral fabric of society, as the Jews promoting diversity know that putting people of differences races in the same environment is disastrous. My solution to unite America would be to bring segregation back, whether it be all non Aryans having their own sector of the country, or having all Aryans leave and colonize and take over Europe, making it a 100% Aryan nation. In this scenario, I would support giving America to the indigenous peoples, the American Indians.

{"author":"MiniBandGeek","created_utc":1522171867,"num_comments":3,"score":12,"selftext":"The /r/libertarian sidebar is actually something really intriguing. Of all the things that go through the community, the sidebar is one of those few things that is static. In some ways, that's a really useful thing - the links to other communities and external websites can lead to really interesting discussions on libertarianism. However, it hasn't been updated in a while, and it shows.\n\nThe first thing that strikes me as odd is the \"as encouraged by reddiquette\" phrase. It's used to help justify why content isn't formally regulated, but reddiquette has evolved since the sidebar's creation. Now, many policies directly contrast the information in the sidebar:\n\n* Moderate based on quality, not opinion. The reddiquette now encourages moderation on the quality of content. Whether or not that is something you agree with, the sidebar should be adjusted to reflect this point, either by taking out the reddiquette comment or changing policy.\n* Keep your submission titles factual and opinion free. How many posts reach the top here off a heavily biased title? The same as before - if you aren't going to moderate it, don't link the reddiquette like you care about it.\n* Voting in general. A main bullet point is to not downvote comments. The reddiquette encourages downvoting content that you feel is off topic or deconstructive, as well as explaining why you disagree.\n* As a last note, /r/libertarianism is not the worst abuser of this policy, but it does blatantly go against reddiquette in several important ways. Why bother mentioning it if you're not going to follow it?\n\nBesides reddiquette, the other great issue with the sidebar is dated links and clutter. The IRC channel linked is all but dead, like most internet relay chats nowadays. References to specifically \"pharma\" spam are confusing - I've been around for a few years on and off and only have an inkling of what is meant by that - and could probably be replaced by a more general and professional reference to paid content. Lastly, SO MANY of the links are for communities that are dead or dying. Perhaps some of them could be revived with awareness, but others, like /r/RONPAULR3VOLUTION literally have not had a post in 7 months. Seriously, cut down on the listed communities, or at the very least consolidate these links into a link for a single text post to reduce clutter.\n\nEvery week there's a meta post about the professionalism of this community. Recreating the sidebar to be more professional is the first step toward making this community something people can take seriously and be proud to be a part of.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"[Meta] The sidebar for our community REALLY needs to be updated."}

We have fought hard for all men to be free. Who is it who dares to think that he owns you?! We will deal with him directly.\u201d The man looked up and down the street, prepared to join forces against anyone coming for this man.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d the sad man admitted, \u201cI am not a chattel slave. But I am not free either. It would be far better were I a slave. For then, I would be assured free food, free health care, free housing! Ah,\u201d the sad man mused, \u201cthat would be the life!\u201d\n\n**Wage slavery**\n\n\u201cI do not understand,\u201d the kind man was confused. \u201cAre you or are you not being forced to work for someone?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d the man looked down, \u201cI am a wage slave. I am forced to work. For if I do not, they will impose the cruelest of penalties - I will starve to death.\u201d He took a great sobbing breath. \u201cWoe, woe is me, for I am truly a slave!\u201d\n\n**Following your passion**\n\n\u201cBut can you not do any job in order to earn your food?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no work that I want to do.\u201d the sad man sighed.\n\n\u201cWhen you are free to choose any type of work, you choose to do nothing?\u201d the kind man was surprised.\n\n\u201cWell, work is not freedom.\u201d the sad man explained to this dull passer-by. \u201cWere I free, I would be able to sit here on this curb all day, smoke pot, and sing happy tunes.\u201d the sad man looked wistfully down at his guitar. \u201cBut, woe is me.

Lasting as long as he could, the kind man gently placed his hand over the sad man\u2019s pick.\n\n**The constraint of satisfying others**\n\n\u201cPerhaps there is something else that you would like to do that, maybe, requires not so much singing?\u201d offered the kind man kindly.\n\nThe sad man was sad again. \u201cYou see! My labor is worth nothing if no one wants it.\u201d He strummed a sour G chord while humming G sharp.\n\n**An artificial constraint**\n\n\u201cThink hard.\u201d the kind man counseled. \u201cWhat else might you want to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I do like to smoke pot.\u201d A plan started to form. \u201cPerhaps I can sell pot from this very curb, and make enough to smoke, and to eat, and to sing, without ever having to leave the curb?\u201d\n\nThe sad man looked down the street where a policeman was eyeballing them suspiciously. \u201cBut, alas, I may not do that. No,\u201d the sad man concluded, \u201cthere is nothing that I want to do.\u201d\n\n**Helping others to help yourself**\n\n\u201cPerhaps you can do something that is less about what you want to do, but more about what other people want from you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that is not freedom.\u201d the sad man disabused the kind man. \u201cFreedom is me doing whatever I want whenever I want, without any need, any constraint, or any responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what will you trade for food if you are unwilling to give others anything that they want?\u201d the kind man wondered.\n\n**Forcing others to help yourself**\n\nAn idea darkened the sad man\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou \u2026 should feed \u2026 me!\u201d the sad man measured his words dangerously.\n\n\u201cI?\u201d the kind man took a step back in surprise. \u201cPerhaps I might give you something now,\u201d he patted his pockets for spare change, \u201cbut I must work to feed myself and my family; I do not want to add you to my dependents simply because you will not help yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have no right to enslave me,\u201d the sad man was now very angry, \u201cjust to feed your own fat face!

I have the right to sit on this curb all day, smoke pot, and sing sweet songs without having to starve to death. No, you owe me and must provide for me so that I can be free.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then I would be your slave,\u201d the kind man pointed out.\n\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d the sad man sat back wistfully on the curb and started abusing his guitar again. \u201cThat would be freedom.\u201d\n\n - **Dennis Pratt**","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"A Tale of Wage Slavery"}

Even in this past week it\u2019s become clear that Italy\u2019s next prime minister will likely be from [Lega Nord](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lega_Nord), a political party whose entire platform is comprised primarily of hash anti-immigration sentiment. Essentially the [center has evaporated in many countries](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/why-the-center-collapsed-in-italy-recession-austerity-and-immigration/amp)\n\nFrance, Germany, the UK and now US are all tipping toward far right nationalism. Turkey has a literal dictator now. We had Brexit, Le Pen, Trump and many other examples that seemed almost impossible 20 years ago. \n\nBUT\n\nThe most alarming thing is that all of this craziness... all of this political upheaval is a reaction to *such* a small amount of immigration... this recent round of immigration is nothing.\n\nNothing compared to the tidal wave we are going to see in a few decades from climate change. When more and more third world countries collapse under the stress of food/water scarcity/civil wars how will Europe react then? Syria resulted in around 5 million migrants and it forever altered the political environment of Europe.\n\nWhat will the west do if there are 10 Syria\u2019s simultaneously. \n\nMy fear is that we have only seen the tip of the iceberg in terms of how nationalistic and harsh these governments are going to become. Historically it seems that every society has a limit to how many immigrants it will tolerant until flipping harshly toward the right. So while some countries will welcome the refugees initially with open arms (Germany), I\u2019m afraid they are only opening themselves to the risk of racially motivated populist movements. Almost as if the very act of compassion results in an equal and opposite negative reaction. \n\nIf so... the EU is done. Every country seems to be retreating inward. Away from cooperation. Away from peace. And toward the ethnic majority and closed borders. Self preservation will be the excuse, but my fear is that genocide will be the result.\n\n\nAND\n.\n.\n.\n\nfor the United States. God help us if Mexico begins to collapse. Some of the drought projections are not looking good for our southern neighbor. 100+ million people in desperation. If you think we\u2019ll be welcoming them across the border with humanitarian aid and lolipops you\u2019ll be sadly disappointed. But I\u2019m afraid by that point the far right may be completely ingrained itself in American politics. Mexicans will no longer be people. They\u2019ll be enemies of American security and they\u2019ll be met with barbed wire and drone strikes. People scoff at Trumps wall now. But in a few years, the public may very well demand it.\n\nApologies for the gloom and doom. But we can\u2019t ignore this any longer.

How sad, that when an edict is enacted, there is no scream, but only subservience.\n\nBy contrast, I will tell the story of a misguided rancher, who for 20 years had disagreed with our government. And at it's climax, in 2014, one man grabbed a rifle and stood his ground against an entire agency and arm of the federal government and defied men he would call oppressors. Even though I may believe him to be in the wrong, the courage of one group of men stands in the annals of our history as a defining moment of the will of man against its government.\n\nBy contrast, still, I would have you remember a more recent memory; one where men and women stood together to air their own grievances against that same government in Sioux Falls. Where you sought to have your voice heard, they sent fire, dogs and brimstone.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause they do not fear you.\n\nThe issue of gun control, is an issue of self control. For if a man gathers and forms a collective, and takes up arms with the aim that he not fire a single bullet in order to have his voice be heard, all the while he quells his anger, then he practices the full meaning of control.\n\nUnderstand that in order to fully encapsulate this issue of control, we must comprehend the vehement position of its counter-argument and those who pick up that banner. In their watchful vigil, they have gone from watchdog to full rabid dog as they defend a position that becomes indefensible. Against the assaults of rhyme and reason, they hold steadfast to an argument that cannot stand fully where it is entrenched.\n\nTo every question, their answer is, \"no.\"\n\nShould a schizophrenic man with no clear ability to reason, whose own reality betrays him, be banned from a gun?\n\nShould a person with a long history of depression have to wait in order to obtain a gun? If so, for how long?\n\nHe denies himself the conversation and by doing so the realities in the deficit of his argument are made bare by sheer circumstance.\n\nIn screaming, \"no,\" to an imaginary policy, he sets himself up for the pendulum of justice to swing past its intended target and overcorrect to his detriment.\n\nFinally, understand our climate. That as every man sees their social contract torn up he says to himself, \"Get mine,\" and \"Not my problem.\" He does so because he reverts back to that same individual that Rousseau first talked about. He, rightly, esteems that his voice goes unheard, and then what reason does he give himself to march onwards with the charade.\n\nMake sure that you do not seek to repeal an amendment simply because you do not see the reason within it.\n\nOpen your eyes to see that there is not one side in this wholly wrong, and not one fully in the right.","subreddit":"PoliticalOpinions2","title":"On Guns, Trenches, and Climate""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"On Guns, Trenches, and Climate"}

So, in order to explain some of the reason why I chose to use this type of language, and correct some of the misconceptions regarding what I'm writing, I want to try to speak plainly.\n\nFirst, I get that a lot of it is difficult to read and you really have to pay attention to the twist and turns that the sentences take you through, but that's by design. If I had kept it easy to read and direct, it wouldn't have the same effect. My point was to make it different from all the articles and text that you find online. Part of that language was also religious. Now, I'm not really a religious person, but my idea was that issues like civil rights, voting, and government are only made clear in this country when its discussed in terms of God and Freedom. The text On Religion, takes the view point of the Christian man in order to ask him to step down from the government. I can't see a way to just attack a person off a position of power. Part of the reason for the reason it reads like you're reading shitty verses is because part of it is supposed to be the pseudo-philosophical attack. The ideas expressed are founded in the same ideas as Rousseau's idea of the individual and what it means to live as a society. It is, literally, what our government is based around. The idea that men and women, dictate the government and not the other way around. The language of the texts applies \"that flowery shit\" so that you get more mad at that than at the fact that I'm attacking some of your viewpoints about what it means to be a Republican and what it means to be a Democrat. I purposefully attack both sides, and find the common ground between them, so that you're aware that both sides of this are equally as wrong. I also choose this format to make you squint. So that in those confusing words, you really have to think about what the hell I'm trying to say. Sorry, if its difficult to read, I'll clarify it here in a second. As to the over use of the commas. You got me; I really don't know where they go. Does anyone?\n\nSecond, I'll get to my message, and put it so plainly that it'll drive most of you to shit all over it. I have to say, that in part, I feed off it. I like defending a defendable position.\n\nMy first idea is that both parties have failed you. I like a lot of the Republican ideals in that sense that the Republican party is the only party that views government as the enemy. I don't mean that government can't be good, but that one of the founding principles of U.S. history is that sweet N.W.A. line \"Fuck the Police.\" Now, I'm not saying that against any law enforcement officers. Clearly, that shit is hard to navigate sometimes. But, I am saying in that sense that the \"police\" is that government agent.\n\nAs far as the Democrats fault in this... it's that when people wanted Bernie Sanders, they got Hillary Clinton. I'm not saying I wanted to see Bernie win, but damn it if the idea that a Super Delegate gets to shit all over my Democracy bother me. Not only that, but considering that the Democratic Party was appointed the mule as its symbol because they wanted to launch an insult at Andrew Jackson by calling him a jackass (a symbol, which he then took himself thinking that the mule is every man's tool, because even if the farmer can't afford a horse, he can still afford a mule); now if they turn around and forget, that they are every man's party... then they become the jackasses that the original insult meant!\n\n(I really apologize for the formatting of that sentence)\n\nSo, both parties are shitting all over you. And somehow, that doesn't bother anyone enough to be angry. A user pointed out that my language used rage to define it. Fuck yea. I'm not sure if it's conveyed, but I really have a love for America and it's history. I get that it's been shitty for a lot of people throughout time, but it paints the picture of a beautiful struggle of freedom. I feel like, however, there is this idea that we're somehow done. Like we've done pretty good and it's enough. My problem, is that the kind of apathy we are talking about tears empires not from the outside, but from within. I'm not saying now, and I've definitely been accused of being an apocalyptic voice that needs to chill out, but my issue is that it's been eroding for a while. All I want is for us to come together, find some common ground and pivot this in a good direction.\n\nI don't think it's a mystery why when people get polled they say that there is a sense that we are going in the wrong direction. I'm not surprised that we float below a 20% voter turnout. I am not surprised that there are black lives matter movement, white supremacist rallies, gun control rallies, women's rallies or any of it. It's a symptom of a government that really doesn't give a shit about you.\n\nThe problem is, that the government is only made in your image, too. You are the ones saying I'm going to care about myself. If the native american warned us that for every picture a piece of your soul got stolen, then he was right. There's this culture where it's not about what you can do for another person, but about what one gets out of it. I know that seems like a gloomy type of view, and I know that there's a large group of people out there that dedicate themselves into being the \"helpers,\" but the idea is that much to many of us only care about how it affects us and our jobs, and our bottom line. Personally, I think that's cause there's a culture of indentured servitude which doesn't lend to a true feeling of freedom, but that's another argument for another day.\n\nSo, I'm the asshole that points out the obvious. How does one go about changing part of the government, so as not to make everyone go apeshit?\n\nFirst, you have to make a list of demands.\n\nIf we are a revolution, then there has to be an enumerated list of reasons for it. I tried to find the most basic ones in our government, and I get that it shakes some people into violent anger that really comes through on the comments section.\n\n1) That there's too much money in Government.\n\nI don't really care what your views are. My problem is that people first tell you, that money is speech (Citizens United) and then they try to drown out your voice, in your face, and you don't give a shit. Cool, cool, cool.\n\nHow do we fine a pulse of what we believe, if we can't even hear it?\n\n2) That for some odd reason the Christian propped himself in our government. Forget that there is no mandate within the religion to cling to power this way, but the idea that they say they get to dictate law and order, only makes them vulnerable. In all issues, the pendulum swings back. Eventually, the Christian person will become the minority. How does he protect himself from having law and order dictated against him? Only if he takes the time to step off government and create a space for all of us.\n\nA lot of people want to keep telling you about the separation of Church and State. I would rather think about it in terms of creating a space for God and State. The Christian man should be allowed in government. If the Christian man can't uphold his oath to God and to the constitution, then he has two choices: renounce God, or resign your office. But if you want to tell me that religion has no place in government, then you've forced me to abandon a big part of myself. So then, you can choose to say there is no space for religion in government either. This is also further echoed by the fact that other people should also bring their religion to government. The compromise here, is that both the christian and the atheist man have to find that sweet Natural Law that Rousseau and Locke and all those other philosophers talk about. My idea of government comes from a 16 century preacher by the name of John Edwards. No, not that asshole who cheated on his dying wife, John Edwards. There was a preacher that used to say that death was the ultimate equalizer. That no matter the man, death was exactly the same to all of us. A mystery.\n\nI like that view for my government. Not that it's about death, but that it touches everyone the same way. Whether it's a corporation, or a citizen (or what color) it molests everyone the same way.\n\n\nAnd because they want to water down your vote, and squash your rights I want to take steps to protect it.\n\n3) That gerrymander ends. Seriously? Why are we even having this conversation? They draw some shitty maps in order to make the person across the street vote in a different district. That's fucked up, yo. But again, at this point, like a bitch, you take it.\n\n4) Why isn't election day a holiday? I mean, we have veteran's day, to honor what they fight for, memorial day to remember when they fought for it, but not a day to honor the day that it takes place? You're telling me Columbus gets one, but not election day? Seriously guys, nobody raging?\n\n\nNow the craziest part about this is the plan. I don't know how or why, but I think there's a chink in the government's armor. Having in the past, worked for the courts, I know first-hand the sheer amount of volume of people that have to go through our courts. Imagine if you told them all to send their cases to juries. Imagine if you asked not only them, but you then compounded the problem by having peaceful marches which led to arrests. After arresting them, you send them to the jails to spread that same message to send everything to jury trial. The dockets will be full and that will only be part of the problem. Imagine how annoying it would be to have 6 jurors for misdemeanors and 12 for felonies (in my state) show up to court. Then to pay them a small ass stipend for their day, all while they miss a full day of work. Think about the cost to not only the tax payer, who has to pay for judge, jury, prosecution, court reporter and bailiff, but then to the corporations for having that employee miss a day of work.\n\nIn the words of Harold and Kuuuuuuuumar, \"Burn it down, pookie!\"\n\n\nLastly, I've had a few people attack me on my mental health. I'm not sure how much of that comes across through my writing, but I'd like to think that I'm a fairly self-aware individual and have staved off most serious problems. I definitely know I have my own \"demons,\" but, really, who doesn't. If you want to talk about some of this stuff, whether to relate or to satisfy a curiosity. If you take a look at my responses, however, you'll find that I'm a fairly positive person, willing to reach out to someone in kindness rather than a harsh word. Don't get me wrong, I'll try and set you straight, but I don't think it does anybody any good to just put someone down for no particular reason. I say that fully aware of my insult of Donald Trump in one of my essays. I've always been told to provide examples though.\n\nI also want to point out that if this should ever make me famous. I would consider it the worst curse that you could bestow on a person. I love my privacy. Celebrities are people who get attacked for any and all reason. Why the hell would I want that? Nothing in this world would make me happier than having a corner of this world to myself where I can know love and happiness. I am the type of person that honestly prefers not to be bothered.\n\nThe reason why I write these things is because I hear it in people hearts and minds, but not on paper and in their words. If I'm the only able to enumerate these grievances, then it is out of duty that I have to do it. I'm only sorry someone else doesn't take up this mantle, so that you can get a decent messenger.\n\nAnyways, it's a short list. I have my reason for all of these which I've obviously made very difficult to read in other essays.\n\nI'd love to talk to anyone, or debate anyone these ideas. But my goal is to tell you that neither party will actually advocate for these. So then the answer is that we have to form a different party. I understand that the two-party system doesn't lend itself to third parties, but my ideas is actually a bit more ambitious. I was to do merge the best part of both parties and destroy them both, and eventually it's natural opposite will form. I want to merge the message of God and Freedom together, so that I can bring you all together. I want to make a new party, so that it makes it easier for you to come off those trenches. I chose the name of the Bull party before I realized that Teddy R. had the bull moose party way back in the day. I thought, how cool. But I want to make it the Bull party. Our Party mascot is Paul Bunyon's ox, Blue.\n\nThe question is whether you're going to go all Will Farrell on me: \"At'a Boy Blue!\"","subreddit":"PoliticalOpinions2","title":"On Language and Intent""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"On Language and Intent"}

According to the NOAA at least *fifty* people die each year from lightning strikes here and hundreds are severely injured in the *millions* of lightning strikes each year! At least some of them CHILDREN!\n\nIt is time to end this madness. It is time to end this suffering. It is 2018. We should not have to live in constant fear of being murdered by lightning strikes any more. The apathy and the silence must stop *now*. With some simple, common sense, reasonable measures we can stop lightning strikes from killing the tens and tens of lives it claims each year.\n\nThe first place to start is with pools. Nearly fifty percent of lightning deaths involved pools. This is because water naturally conducts lightning and increases the speed at which it can spread by between thirty and four hundred percent. But more dangerous by far are high capacity outdoor pools which can contain seventy five thousand square pounds of water at any given time which is equivalent to seventeen strikes of lightning. Compare this to small, reasonable pools (which are PERFECTLY valid for recreation) that only equate to about half a strike of lightning.\n\nWe need to have reasonable, and also common sense, restrictions on these high capacity industrial pools which serve no real recreational purpose and are only good at killing people with lightning. We need to limit the size of pools to these standard recreational sizes (about two feet in depth and five feet in diameter) which is something *everyone*, regardless of whether or not you own a pool, should be able to get behind as a *reasonable and common sense measure*.\n\nTo further limit the ability of lightning to get its hands on pools when it strikes we need to levy a fifty percent tax on chlorine. Because everyone knows that having less chlorinated water available will deter lightning from striking. It\u2019s just good, reasonably common sense.\n\nAnother non-partisan, common sense reasonableness to enact would be to place insulated lightning rods every fifteen feet. But I\u2019d be happy if we just put them every twenty feet. Note my willingness to *COMPROMISE* to achieve REASONABLE COMMON SENSE! It doesn\u2019t HAVE to be every fifteen feet, it CAN be every twenty feet! The fact that I can COMPROMISE shows just how unreasonable these Pro-Pool hardliners really are. I\u2019m willing to compromise and they\u2019re not. Totally unreasonable.\n\nThe lightning rods will, of course, be paid for by taxes levied on pool water and chlorine. If pool owners want to increase the risk our society faces by owning pools (FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES) then they need to subsidize our protection from their dangerous hobbies.\nIn conclusion, I hope you can join me in supporting REASON and COMMON SENSE.

That's about it.\n\nI think I don't like the videos both because of mistakes Steven is making, and because the format of having a random person verbally discuss complicated political issues makes for uncontrolled, nonlinear, hard-to-follow dialogue.\n\nAbout the former, Steven makes a big deal out of things that prevent him from getting to interesting places during his talks. For example, during his last Change My Mind episode at the University of Illinois, one guest that came up referred to the non-aggression principle as \"autistic,\" Steven misinterpreted him and thought that he was calling him autistic, and this led to Steven calling the guest rude and uncivil. Big mistake to misinterpret someone like this if twenty-thousand people are watching you to learn about political issues and you make a big deal about nothing. They never ended up actually addressing the guests ideas about the non-aggression principle after this.\n\nLater in the same conversation, the guest says, \"[You won't get stricter immigration laws] if you shill for the capitalists. They are against you.\" His point with this connected to a point he made earlier, which was that if the minimum wage was higher, illegal immigrants (and I think he meant low-skilled immigrants in general) would not come to the country because no company forced to pay $15 an hour would be able to hire them. Steven got, in my opinion, horribly and unreasonably irritated at this guests use of the word \"shill\" and threatened to kick him off. While shill might not have been the exact right word, dwelling on it even though what he meant by it was clear (something like \"support\") is so unbelievably annoying from a viewer standpoint. I want the argument to be addressed, not for you to take offense at minute details of the words or debate tactics being used. The guest then said that he thought Steven was getting angry because he was losing the debate, and Steven said that the person losing the debate would be the person using words like \"shill\" and \"autistic.\" From my perspective, Steven was losing the debate. Not because his ideas were necessarily inferior, I don't know; I didn't even get to hear them. A discussion was not had because right when things seemed to be moving Steven would call out his guest for mischaracterizing him or pulling the shenanigans I detailed above. This seems to happen in a lot of Steven's Change My Mind videos. I would compare it to like how Stephan Molyneux is when on a call with someone he disagrees with; very self-assured, aggressive, and annoying. And this isn't to say that I don't like some of his content, but the criticism stands.\n\nWhen they switched over to the 2nd Amendment topic, a different guest started talking about, fundamentally, what the limits are on what arms a citizen should be allowed to bear and brought up the example of tanks. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Steven never even commented on whether he thought that the right to bear arms includes a private citizens right to own a tank (which, as a viewer, I would really like a perspective on, not because I am desperate to own a tank but because I want to get a feel for what the principle should be that guides what should be allowed and what shouldn't be). What about automatic weapons? Automatic weapons could absolutely be considered \"arms,\" should they be allowed? The cynical part of me thinks that Steven was scared to take a stance here because of how politically inexpedient it would be to come out in favor of legalizing automatic weapons (EDIT: not that, in my opinion, you couldn't make an argument for it). Again, a wholly unproductive discussion.\n\nI post this not because I hate Steven Crowder; I have probably watched upwards of 100 hours of his content from daily shows to Change My Mind videos to whatever else he's done. I say it to get a feel for where other conservative libertarian types, who would, like me, agree with him on most things stand with regard to these Change My Mind videos. They are wildly popular, probably his most popular segment, but I just feel disenchanted with them. He holds the microphone, the power in the conversation as the \"host,\" and has the right to kick you out whenever he wants. It's just... not a real conversation like he thinks it is.\n\nP.S. Inequality does matter. Too much inequality destabilizes the society, as young men are much more prone to crime in areas where there is too much inequality. Jordan Peterson lays this case out quite nicely. Yes, Steven, economics is not a zero sum game, but there are still absolutely reasons as to why it's important to keep inequality in check. I personally think that inequality is kept in check by free markets, the best redistribution tool in existence, but it does matter.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"As a conservative libertarian who would agree with him on most things, I don't like Steven Crowder's Change My Mind videos"}

{"author":"T0mThomas","created_utc":1522417224,"num_comments":11,"score":4,"selftext":"Americans are often told that \"other countries\" don't have mass shooting or gun crime problems and therefore should be emulated. Of course this isn't true, but even assuming this is true, still doesn't justify their then proposed solutions of banning \"assault style weapons\".\n\n\nTake for example Canada, which is certainly the best available corollary due to the cultural and geographical similarities. In Canada, the AR-15, and many other \"assault style weapons\", can be legally obtained by citizens that obtain the proper license. In fact, much larger and more dangerous guns can be obtained in Canada such as .303 or .30-06 big game rifles used for hunting moose and elk. The main differences in Canada is the licensing process is much more stringent.\u00a0\n\n\nSo why does Canada have a more stringent licensing process than the USA? Well, they don't enshrine the right to bear arms as an inalienable natural right in their constitution. The USA does, and it's not really possible to say something is a human right, like life or speech, and simultaneously require a license to have it. It would be a really easy argument to make that even the current federal background checks are unconstitutional along these lines.\u00a0\n\n\nSo this brings us to the only argument the left actually has on this issue, and it goes something like this:\n\n\nDue to accelerated advances in technology, the term \"arms\" has been drastically redefined. While the largest \"arms\" available to the consumer in the constitutional era were canons and muskets, today we have machine guns, ICBMs, grenade launchers, and .50 caliber truck mounted gatling guns. Thus, the constitution needs to be amended to redefine the term \"arms\" to mean light weaponry readily available to criminals or the police. It would then be prudent to allow states and local jurisdictions to further restrict the definition of \"arms\" to fit their local situations - with the caveat that these restrictions also apply to their police, to keep alive the spirit of the armed citizen being able to resist tyrannical authorities.\u00a0\n\n\nThat's argument number one. Argument number two would be to amend the constitution to fully abolish the 2nd amendment. Period. Then governments at all levels can engage in whatever licensing process they desire, just like they do with motor vehicles, and just like Canada.\u00a0\n\n\nBoth arguments mean the left needs to start the constitutional amendment process. This isn't any easy thing to accomplish, but it has been done before, and could be done again. So why isn't this far less combative and polarizing, and far more\u00a0sensical approach to gun control taking place? I don't know, but it certainly has to make you wonder what the true agenda is.\u00a0","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The Only Two Arguments the Left Really Has on Gun Control"}

At the same time, it stimulates the demand side of the economy and promotes free expression (since money is speech).\n\nCollective Bargaining: I'm thinking that this could be required for companies of a certain size to offer their employees the option to have a plurality of representatives (30-40%) on the board to properly represent their interests as well as those of the stockholders.

That being said, I would say I am 50% communist, 35% republican, 10% libertarian, and 5% a combination of many other ideologies, and would consider myself a \u201ccommunist republican\u201d.\n\nI voted for Trump because I am anti establishment, pro secure borders, pro 2nd Amendment, and I am fucking sick of our jobs going overseas. I do not like Trump as a person, and find many of his comments bigoted and disrespectful. However, I did not vote for him because of his personality, I voted for him because I truly believe Trump is going to Make America great again with his policies. I don\u2019t think all of his policies are going to work, but I actually think that\u2019s a good thing. For example, I am disgusted by his capitalistic policies, and his support for Israel (no need to make that conflict worse, either stay out of it or use America\u2019s influence as world police to push for 2 state solution). I honestly believe that Trump\u2019s economic policies are going to be disastrous, causing massive hikes in healthcare costs, more monopolization of major corporations, and although the competition created by Trump\u2019s ultra capitalist style economics will increase the amount of goods produced greatly, it will cause the products to be non durable, shitty, and overall poor quality. That\u2019s what capitalism does, it creates too much innovation and products, leading to a major decrease in quality. For example, take the Apple phones. They are not made to last very long, because Apple wants you to keep buying new ones. They have to do this to make more profits and keep up with the updating tech of other companies. Another major issue with capitalism is the inevitable descent into oligarchy. Corporations have money, and they use their massive amount of wealth to buy politicans, leading to them essentially running the country. \n\n\n I believe that Trump is not who he says he is, and he is lying to the American people about his views. This is not unlike other politicians, however, I believe Trump is lying about who he is because he has our best interests at heart. Trump is a progressive with some communist viewpoints, but he also supports the 2nd Amendment, secure borders, and he does not tolerate disrespect for the nation (kneeling for the national anthem). I personally am ok with NFL players protesting to take a knee, which is an area where I disagree with Trump on. I believe Trump is intentionally screwing over the economy in the short term to spark a revolution and grow the progressive movement. While he is in office, he is working with the Russian government to eventually establish a gulag, where traitors like George Soros, Paul Ryan, John McCain (RINO cuckservatives on Soros\u2019s payroll), etc would be sent to. Donald Trump is starting to drain the swamp (which he hired as cover to appear establishment). \n\nThe alt right and white supremacy is not a concern, contrary to what many moderate anti gun SJW\u2019s say (I consider these the left wing version of the religious right, supporting censorship of offensive things, policing people\u2019s behaviors, etc. therefore, I consider them moderate authoritarians, not progressive.) White supremacy is a joke to the vast majority of the population, and the amount of people that attend those Charlottesville type rallies are nowhere near enough for the movement to gain traction. Their platform is littered with contradictions and pseudoscience that anyone with half a brain can see through (holocaust denial, 19th century outdated racial \u201cscience\u201d, etc). Although Trump does espouse mild bigotry sometimes, that\u2019s all it will be, mean words. You gotta see through the lines, what Trump is doing more than anything is fighting the PC movement that is used to shut down dissenters, such as Berkeley college refusing to let conservative speakers like Milo Yiannopolis and Ben Shapiro speak. As a progressive, I strongly disagree the rhetoric that comes from them, but I will support their right to espouse it and try to be open minded even though I disagree.\n\nTrump is going to be great for this country, even if it may not appear so right now.

But this is also expensive, prevents cops from responding to more serious crime, and fills our jails with people who\u2019s only crime is being homeless (homeless people who steal, rob, threaten or vandalize excluded). And putting them in jail is only a very temporary solution. Others feel we should \u201cdrive them out of the city\u201d but this just dumps the problem on neighboring cities.

It should prompt some productive discussion.\n\n \u201cThe main reason pro-gun people and anti-gun people can\u2019t talk to each other is that their respective rhetorics are based on two irreconcilable worldviews. The anti-gun people are essentially collectivist; the pro-gun people are essentially individualist.\nLately, for example, I\u2019ve been hearing arguments from the anti-gun people about how \u201carming teachers\u201d is a bad idea. The image they\u2019re evoking with this language is that of a group of teachers lining up to receive their mandatory government-issued firearm for use in defending their classrooms. Most proposals I\u2019ve seen, however, aren\u2019t for arming teachers en masse. They are for allowing individual teachers who are already permitted to carry guns to do so on school property. The anti-gun people use collectivist language about \u201carming\u201d a group of people, while the pro-gun people use individualist language about allowing individuals to make a choice about whether to carry a gun.\nSimilarly, anti-gun people often say things like \u201cMore guns are not the solution.\u201d The image they are evoking is that of a basically homogeneous group of people, some percentage of which are causing problems for the group with their guns. To the collectivist mind, the proposed solution\u2013increasing the percentage of gun ownership within the group\u2013is absurd. But of course, arbitrarily increasing the percentage of guns is not a solution anyone is proposing. The solution the pro-gun people are proposing is to remove limitations on the law-abiding members of the group that put them at a disadvantage when dealing with the non-law abiding members.\n\nI often see anti-gun people make statements like \u201cChildren dying isn\u2019t worth your right to have an AR-15.\u201d To a collectivist, this statement makes perfect sense: after all, there\u2019s no doubt that as a group, we\u2019d be better off if there were no AR-15s. To an individualist, though, this statement is at best nonsensical and at worst insulting. To an individualist, the statement translates to \u201cYou personally having an AR-15 increases the chances of children dying.\u201d And it doesn\u2019t help when the anti-gun people go the next logical step and call NRA members \u201cmurderers\u201d for something that none of their individual members have done.\nThis is also how collectivists are able to justify a ban on guns which would have to enforced by people with guns. To the collectivist, \u201cpolice\u201d are a different group than \u201ccivilians,\u201d and it\u2019s assumed that when you are talking about gun regulations, you are talking about regulations for civilians. For individualists, this distinction reeks of hypocrisy, because they see both the police and civilians as individual members of society, to whom the same laws should apply.\n\nThe problem of incompatible worldviews is complicated by the fact that in America, overt collectivism is still frowned on to some degree. Americans of all political stripes like to think we are proponents of individual freedom. Many collectivists in the U.S. are so inculcated in individualist language that they don\u2019t even know they are collectivists (these are the people who resort to supporting their arguments with vague pronouncements about \u201cthe greater good,\u201d \u201csocial welfare,\u201d \u201cthe social contract,\u201d etc.) Thus, collectivists tend (intentionally or unintentionally) to cloak their language in individualist rhetoric about \u201crights.\u201d For example, \u201cDoesn\u2019t my child have a right to go to school without being shot?\u201d\n\nThe problem with this question is that while it\u2019s ostensibly about individual rights, it\u2019s really a way of surreptitiously shifting the conversation onto collectivist grounds. It\u2019s a way of saying that my fear (rational or not) outweighs your so-called rights. And once you accept that premise, you\u2019re stuck in the collectivist mindset. Individual rights are now just an obstacle in the way of creating a perfectly just, peaceful society where no one is ever shot (or harmed in any other way, presumably).\n\nYou\u2019ve probably figured out by now which of these two camps I\u2019m in. I don\u2019t pretend to be objective, but I have some pretty good reasons for preferring the individualist mindset to the collectivist. For one thing, as I\u2019ve already mentioned, it\u2019s telling that the collectivists have to employ misdirection and rhetoric borrowed from individualism in order to make their point. Most Americans still know on some level that the greatness of our country was its emphasis on individual rights over collective concerns, so the collectivists have to rely on deception to win them over.\nSecondly, in my experience individualists have a pretty good understanding of the collectivist worldview. It isn\u2019t difficult for most pro-gun people to perform a convincing imitation of the anti-gun argument. Anti-gun people, on the other hand, seem genuinely incapable of understanding pro-gun arguments, and end up arguing against strawmen tainted by their own collectivist ideology. This leads me to believe that collectivism is an intellectual crutch for those who can\u2019t make sense of individualism.\n\nBut the main problem with collectivism as it relates to gun control and any other problem is that in the end, people *are* individuals. If you break a gun law, you, an individual, go to prison. If a burglar breaks into your house, you, an individual, are victimized. If you shoot a person, you, an individual, are responsible. You can talk about \u201csociety\u201d having a problem with \u201cgun violence,\u201d but in the end what you are talking about is some individuals being hurt by other individuals with guns.\nCollectivist language can be useful, but the collectivist worldview is at best an approximation and at worst a crutch for bigots and the intellectually lazy. Laws are applied to individual people, and I believe they should be passed with that in mind. You don\u2019t have to believe that, but if you are in favor of gun control, you should at least make an effort to understand why many people do.\u201d  \n\n-Randy Caudle","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Collectivism vs individualism"}
