Generally I align more with the left, but after talking with some other left leaning friends and family, I think I'd classify myself as a Libertarian (but who cares about labels, right?)\n\n* Taxes - I think taxes are a necessary evil. I also dont really have a problem with my taxes going to programs I dont agree with. While there is a shitload of waste with our taxes, a country our size does need a tax pool to ensure smooth operation. Also our personal taxes should in no way, whatsoever, assist private companies in any way, shape, or form. If all the banks are about to fail without a government bailout, let them fail. I'd also cut a lot of services to lower taxes on everyone. Also, every individual and business that operates in the US will pay taxes to the US, no more loopholes or special considerations for anyone. Also property taxes are fucked.\n\n* Individual rights - I believe laws and taxes that stop or tax an individual in their private lives need to be put to an end. I just learned that in my city you need to register your pets with the city and pay a fee, that's pants on head retarded. Guns need to follow \"Shall not be infringed\" to a T. Our \"gun problem\" is not a gun problem, its a health problem. Drugs should be an individuals choice. If I want to shoot liquid LSD into my dick hole in my own home, then I should be able too. Keep government out of our lives and personal choices.\n\n* Privatization of government services - I think this is a horrible choice, as is evidenced by our current private prison system. People with a monetary horse in the race will do anything they can do maximize profits and that is not good for the general public. Allowing a for-profit organization to act on behalf of the government will be rife with corruption. Separate the public and private sectors.\n\n*   Right to healthcare and education - A healthy and educated populous is essential. I hate that America is the power it is with such a poor system for health and education. How can we call ourselves great when a standard college education puts us tens of thousands into debt? How can we call ourselves  great if our healthcare system is on fire and causing people to lose everything because of their medical bills? I believe these two are rights as important to an individual as any others.\n\n* Police - Another pants on head retarded issue in my opinion is the police have way too much power, and they are becoming a domestically based military force. There's no reason for our police to have armored personnel carriers, tear gas, flash bang grenades, AR15s in every squad car. There's no reason for police to think they are anything other than public servants, yet here we are with many police and citizens seeing police as a higher tier citizen with a gun and a portable tax machine. Their main purpose at the moment is to raise money, and keep the population from straying from the government mandated norm. Also, the government needs to stop spying on us.\n\n* Military - We need a military for defense purposes only. Scale our size and scope back drastically. Leave us out of global military conflicts/politics that dont endanger us or our close allies. Bring our soldiers home, cut military spending drastically, stop fetishizing military service, and allow our allies to take a larger role in their own domestic security. Stop using our military strength and intelligence agencies to influence politics of other nations. Let us be us, and them be them. \n\nOverall I'm for medium sized government in charge of infrastructure, health care, education, the penal system, a smaller military, and a citizen protection oriented police force. Government out of our personal lives and homes, individual freedom is of utmost importance. \n\nIn your opinion do my beliefs fall under the Libertarian umbrella?

{"author":"MOSDemocracy","created_utc":1522588502,"num_comments":0,"score":2,"selftext":"Ayn Rand and Democracy\n\n Original here: https://goo.gl/GrhoqE Please discuss about which leads to liberty and justice: democratic government or no government\n\nAyn Rand gave a very different concept of freedom that usually runs against commonly held beliefs. Normally when we hear about the Federal Reserve in the United States we hear that it is a good organisation that regulates the banking system from going into a speculative spiral. But Rand says that it actually leads to financial crises by imposing useless regulations. Similarly, Rand says that the Food and Drug Administration hinders the well being and health of citizens instead of improving them as we usually believe! The same goes for the new deal or the civil rights act and so on. One would be amazed that an ideology that appears so extreme actually gained so much traction. The reason is that Ayn Rand gives some very valid criticisms of the duality of many people moralising on one side and the same people succumbing to the same 'selfishness' and 'indulgences' that they criticise. More practically she tried to answer the defects in the modern polity and decision-making system. She tried to find a solution to the situation where people who dominate society try to subjugate and enslave others through false moralising and imposing rigidity.\n\nWe usually see various lobbies and pressure groups pulling the legislature and the executive in various directions. We see gullible politicians, who speak something and do something else once in power, getting manipulated into pleasing these various pressurisers with the outcome being a paradoxical and labyrinthine set of laws and rules. License Raj as we call in India represented such an example of executive overreach. These, in turn, hinder and many times cripple the functioning of those aspects of social life that they are supposed to enable.\n\nThe solution that Rand gives is to not make any rules or laws at all! She goes on to say that there is no such thing as society! Rand observed that the suffering and backwardness of humans arose from the imposition of arbitrary rules and laws that benefit some people and due to violent reactions against those who violated them. Rand had much hopes in \u201cvoluntary\u201d unions of people and in particular markets and corporations. What Rand found good about these things is that anybody, the workers, the shareholders and so on could walk away at any moment from the organisation but still, they voluntarily stayed and worked together because they found it best in their rational self-interest to cooperate.\n\nSince people are voluntarily cooperating with each other and these voluntary organisations have no violence (at least Rand assumes so), they ought to be the core of human activity. The role of the state should be that of a security guard. For example, in an apartment complex, the security guards guard the people within and also prevent people from attacking each other within the apartments. But the guards have no authority to tell the people in the apartments what to do and what not to do. Thus Rand asks for the separation of state and the economy (and also the withdrawal of the state from the social sphere too actually) which means that the legislative capacity of the state should be severely limited. Just like how the present constitutions and courts prevent the state and government from infringing on freedom of speech or life, similarly, she asks for a very strict constitution that limits the power of the state to just enforcing agreements that people enter into voluntarily and preserving law and order. No law should dictate the kinds of agreements that can take place.\n\nDemocracy - solution to corruption and violence\n\nWe at MOSDEM find that by denying the existence of society itself, actually Rand herself ignores reality. Although her concern with executive excesses and arbitrariness of decision making in the modern polity is correct, she jolts to an extreme approach negating the outcomes and products of thousands of generations of human experience. Instead, we contend that excesses of government (or executive) should be reigned in by proper laws and their correct implementation, curtailing executive overreach. As for the laws themselves, to remove the arbitrariness and influence of vested interests on the polity and lawmaking MOSDEM simply proposes to move in the direction that we have been moving all along since the last couple of hundred years \u2013 more democracy!\n\nDemocracy does not mean mob rule as Rand so dismissively puts it. The mob cannot be prevented from dominating others by a set of holy laws and constitution book given by Gods (or founding fathers) to be implemented by force and violence, or at gunpoint in her own language. Instead, the crux of democracy is cooperative decision making and implementation for the survival and development of the whole group \u2013 it applies to a family, to an organisation, to a corporation, to any association or union and to the whole society itself. MOSDEM points out that conflicting and oppressive laws or 'policy paralysis' can be remedied simply by following the people's mandate! We need political parties to put forward the exact laws and amendments they are going to enact before the people and to compel the parties to enact those drafts exactly as they promised in their manifesto, nothing more or less. This not only makes the entire polity run according to the direction that people give it but also solves the problem of vested interests and lobbies ruining the decision making process and browbeating elected leaders into following their agenda.\n\nWe place the ultimate authority not in a mystic God or a leader or a party, not even in a holy constitution as Rand wants, but in the people. Not just in theory as we have now, where the parties promise people every five years only to tread on those very promises the very next day after elections, but in actual practice.\n\nWhy we want this and not the extreme position that Rand proposes should be explored in detail in later articles.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Defects in Ayn Rand's Theory"}

He proposed a \"libertarian socialist market economy\" (whatever this is) as replacement of the current system  because he argued that capitalism is exploitation and that only one person can profit from a transaction (\"for every winner there must be a loser\"). When I countered that a voluntary contract or transaction profits both sides, he just said I didn't bring forward \"real\" facts. \nIn the end, I came to the conclusion that the biggest problem nowadays is the lack of economical knowledge. It is interesting and at the same frightening that anti-capitalist think that they just have to throw and repeat some socialist buzzword and phrase like exploitation without knowing what the difference between it and a voluntary contract is. They despise every notion of voluntarism and freedom since it could lead to a unequal result. \nThe reason for this behavior is the lack of any economic classes in schools. For example, in many schools in Germany (where I live) you don't learn anything about economics. You only learn the bad effects of capitalism in politics or geography. After the high school, many students know just the bad sides of a market economy and start to reason in an anti-capitalistic way. They don't understand that capitalism is based on voluntary individual decisions. This lack of knowledge leads to ignorance and to more government interventions into the economy.\n\nIn my opinion, the only way to break this cycle is to educate them and only after that step we can hope to create a free market. They need understand how a market works and how capitalism historically developed.\n\nWhat are your opinions on that?\nWhat is the best way to achieve this?\n\nPS.: I know that this problem is well known but I wanted to share my view on it.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The real Problem with Education"}

Libertarians believe that taxation is theft and that government intervention in the economy will only impair efficiency. Private companies should be allowed to discriminate against minorities. Antitrust law and the vast majority of regulations are unneeded government interference in the economy. Government should not provide welfare for its citizens. Social security should be privatized. We should end the federal reserve and let the private sector determine interest rates. 9/11 was a response to and was caused by US intervention in the middle east.\n\n\n\n\nIf one was explaining these and other things to a mainstream modern liberal, what do you think their reaction would be? Do you expect them to be persuaded? Put yourself in their shoes. Even if you provide detailed explanations for why the things that you propose are true, the brusque nature of these statements and the connotations of words such as \u201ccapitalism\u201d might very well often hold them back from realizing or admitting that they agree with you. As someone who goes to school with thousands of modern liberals everyday, I can tell you that if you say things directly right off the bat like this, you will not only fail to persuade anyone, you will further solidify their beliefs and their opposition to us. Arguments are not the primary way to make someone sympathetic to your beliefs, it is relatability, likeability and avoiding certain words that is likely to determine whether someone agrees with you or not. Leaving out the ultimate conclusions of libertarian policy may be necessary to at first establish someone as sympathetic to your message. Once someone is sympathetic, they may be more open to the logical and directly stated conclusions of libertarian ideas like the items above.\n\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s try some more statements. \n\n\n\nClassical liberals believe that you own yourself and the products of your labor. Liberals believe in an economy of free-exchange and voluntary association on the marketplace. Classical liberals believe greatly in the power of private charity, and we think that government hurts the ability of that charity to do it's great work. Liberals are liberals because we believe in human beings and don\u2019t believe they need to be told what to do by a large government. Corporations today actively benefit from regulatory capture and that harms everyone else, including small businesses. In order to keep corporations in line, we need to limit the power of government. The true marketplace is a democracy where the consumer is king. \n\n\n\n\nImagine again that you are a modern liberal but one who is not entirely cemented in their positions. Properly explained and connected with the principle of self ownership, I can bet most modern liberals wouldn\u2019t even disagree with most of these statements, unless they are already firmly entrenched in their ideology. Most people, though, really aren\u2019t. In this day of polarization it might seem impossible for one to be converted to the other side of the political spectrum. What people need to do though is to come to the discussion with the ability to state your positions honestly, but in the way that most appeals to the current beliefs of who you are talking to. If you\u2019re talking to a modern liberal, agree wherever you can agree, and try to draw conclusions from your statements that would be interpreted by the person listening to you as supporting social justice and democracy. Even if you are an ancap who doesn\u2019t support democracy, it\u2019s more important to get across to someone the broad ideas of your ideology that you can frame in a way in which they agree with then to espouse total ideological consistency. The first priority is to make them sympathetic to your beliefs, then you can get into things that would have turned them off earlier such as the nature of taxation and convert them more firmly into your camp. This same policy applies to mainstream conservatives. Appeal to their values with general libertarian principles, while initially sacrificing total consistency in order to make them sympathetic with you.\n\nAdditionally, libertarians/liberals in initially trying to convert those on the mainstream political spectrum should generally focus more on the benefits of liberty than the flaws of intervention. When you do discuss interventionism, as will be necessary, focus on how that intervention will negatively affect the liberty that they accept is a good thing. In your initial discussion stay away from entitlements/welfare if at all possible. Being against those is one of the easiest ways to turn many people off to you when they're not already sympathetic.\n         \n\n I think the dropping of one word and the reclamation of another word in particular has the potential to make liberty far more appealing. Libertarians/liberals should move away from using the word \u201ccapitalism\u201d. Although we might view the ideal as capitalism and what we have now crony capitalism, the average person views crony capitalism as just capitalism. The term has an increasingly negative connotation. Instead, we should talk about it in the terms of voluntary transactions and the marketplace. Say the same stuff, just use different words.\nAlso, if at all possible, we should be trying to identify ourselves as liberals in the sense of classical liberalism, at least when trying to convert modern liberals which is what I have most experience with. If these people view us as a subset of the views they already hold, they will be far more likely to accept our ideas. Besides, technically we stole libertarian from socialists just as modern liberals stole liberal from us. If we could all get back to where we were that would be good. \n\n\nIf all libertarians/liberals took this advice, I think they\u2019d find that discussions they have online and especially in real life will be more likely to succeed in changing the other person's view, and eventually the public image of the movement will transform. \n\n**TL;DR Focus on presenting your ideas in a way that your ideological opponent and potential convert will agree with, and work from there to get them fully onboard with libertarianism.**\n\nP.S. If you disagree with some of the statements that I made at the top that's okay, it doesn't make the advice any less applicable and this is intended for anyone who leans towards liberty. The statements are just examples of what a libertarian *might* say and what kind of thing they should *not* say when first talking with a non-libertarian.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How to Better Promote Libertarianism in Discussion"}

I've been doing a great deal of research lately and I read this sub frequently to learn different perspectives in the various debates going on here. The more I learn the more convinced I am that being a libertarian is a logical choice and promotes personal freedom and allowing people to make their own choices so long as they also deal with the consequences. If that is incorrect please feel free to tell me I don't understand anything yet. \n\nThere are a few things I've seen that I'm really not sure of. The animal cruelty thread in this sub in conjunction with some things I've read from other sources prompted me to create this post. Is supporting freedom to do whatever one wants to an animal a libertarian ideal? I can't tell whether this is a libertarian view or if there are just a few people who consider it to be a libertarian view. I'm not interested in debating whether or not animals are capable of conscious thought and self awareness. I do not have any doubts on that score and I don't think it is possible to change another person's views on the subject. If someone doesn't see animals as self-aware and conscious beings the only way he or she will ever change that view is to reach a different conclusion independently. I come from a family that has always rescued and cared for animals and I've continued that into adulthood while I now have my husband working with me as well. I can't comprehend how anyone can't see that they are self-aware and capable of thoughts and emotions but people who don't see that probably  can't understand how I do. \n\nI would like to know if there is an accepted position on the issue of animal cruelty or is it entirely up to each individual? I found some of the comments here and in other libertarian forums very disturbing. I can't comprehend advocating for animal cruelty. I am a vegetarian but I'm not a vegan and my family isn't vegetarian. I also make my own food for my animals so I use meat frequently. I don't have a problem with hunting or farming when it is done humanely, although it is more realizing it is necessary than actually wanting animals to die for food. If it was possible to avoid it I would work towards that goal but it is not possible right now. I really want to understand how this issue is addressed via Libertarian beliefs.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I would appreciate it if someone could answer some questions"}

The dispute continues at diplomatic level. At times the otherwise peaceful region is shaken again with military exercises,  blockades, local and regional issues. Domestic governments in Argentina and the United Kingdom use the dispute when it is convenient to their interest without a glimpse of a definitive solution. \n\nCan we do anything for peace? A reminder to the reader, this is a series I called TERRITORIAL DISPUTES. I introduced basic conceptual elements and thereafter, I apply a theoretical frame (based on Rawlsian methodology) to solve well-known sovereignty disputes or conflicts. I explore what reasonable people would do in a territorial dispute. \n\nIn order to do it, I assume the representatives of each claiming party (sovereign States and a non-sovereign character) choose a rule based on theory game. I go for the maximin. From there, these ideal people come up with a solution to the conflict.\n\nThese past week I introduced the Falklands/Malvinas' case and left the door open to apply next week the methodology to this dispute. Below all the links to all five posts from this week.\nQuestions for the readers:\n1. Any disagreement with the facts?\n2. Any information or opinion you may want to share?\n3. How can we solve this territorial dispute?\n\nREMINDER Note: I\u2019ll only post on r/Libertarian on Tuesday a summary of what I do weekly on the blog to avoid spamming this sub-reedit as that is not my intention. I only aim to open a healthy discussion.\n\nComments welcomed. Guest writers would be hugely appreciated. As you may see from the posts Falklands/Malvinas islanders have previously participated.

As I become more politically engaged with republicans and other conservatives in my community, the more and more I realize that they don't actually have convictions about the proper function of government - rather, they have certain values and they expect the government to support those values. \n\nI'm a gun owner, staunch 2nd amendment supporter, and have voted Republican in every election since 2002, except for the most recent presidential election. I generally don't view myself in political terms, but if cornered I'll tell people I lean conservative. I've always thought of conservatives as the \"small government\" party, and Republican politicians certainly pay lip service to that principle. I'm also an attorney and my approach to government is generally rules-based; you don't let the preferred outcome in a particular situation drive decision making. You have to think about the precedent you're setting, and how it can be applied when the facts are different.\n\nObviously the Republicans are as bad as Democrats when it comes to authoritarianism, but I've discovered that same issue extends to conservatives in general. Ever since the most recent presidential campaign cycle began I've been spending more and more time on r/Conservative and I'm always surprised at how little the conservatives there understand a simple principle: the rules you impose on other people can be imposed upon you. If you want the government to silence people you don't like when \"your guy\" is in charge, expect the people you don't like to silence you when \"their guy\" is in charge. \n\nThis is particularly hard for me, given how often I agree with conservatives regarding the substance of an issue (e.g., stable and healthy family units are the foundation of great societies) but completely disagree regarding how to achieve those issues (e.g., encourage marriage equality and adoptions for gay couples to create more families vs. forbid gay marriage). Another example is the boycotts that have recently been encouraged against Laura Ingraham - I was shocked to read a thread on r/conservative where posters wanted the government to step in and prevent \"liberal  bullies\" from censoring Ingraham to protect her 1st Amendment rights. Not only does that display a breathtaking ignorance about how the 1st Amendment works, but it is bizarrely authoritarian. I said as much, and was [banned](https://i.imgur.com/VQO3kWp.png) for [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/88zh88/cnns_joan_walsh_attacks_parkland_survivor_kyle/dwoqg8h/).\n\nMy point is this - conservatives are authoritarians, who care very little about the free market or civil liberties if those principles don't serve conservative interests. I forgot that in the crush of the recent gun control controversy, but I won't be doing that again. ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Reminder: Conservatives love big government too"}

No way.  \n\nOne last thought- how does a libertarian mobilize and make change.  The whole principe is that freedom of choice is just that - which includes it seems the belief that one shouldnt impose ones belief over another.  Which if Im right (?) then how do you get anything accomplished towards building that utopia?\n\nCapitalist society is as imperfect as a Socialist society... both have their pros and cons- but they organize well around their underlying principles- which to me has Libertarians beat.\n\nThis is not meant to offend anyone.

They implement unfair practices like forced partnerships with local companies, blatant currency manipulation, exhorborent tariffs on western products, flagrant IP/ patent violations and unshameful state sponsored corporate theft. Surely, we can't let these practices go on with impunity but at the same time I realise that as libertarian, libertarian leaning or classical liberals any efforts to impede trade may be antithetical to our nature.\n\nThis question was prompted based on a recent Reason Podcast I heard, where I believe Nick Gillespie and Katherine Mangu-Ward admonished Elon Musk for suggesting harsher penalties for China due to their unfair practices.\n\nThank you all for taking the time to consider and answer this question.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"On The Issue Of Chinese Tariffs and Libertarian Philosophy"}

Other great inventions have come from profit motives (and maybe even altruism) in capitalist systems: Motorola's handheld mobile telephone, Siegfried Marcus's petrol powered automobile. And other great inventions have been made courtesy of combinations of profit motives, forced funding, and altruistic giving; advances in medicine across the world come to mind here.

I want to make sure that people in this sub do not do that.\n\nThese tariffs are a really big deal in these parts. Seriously, the soy tariff was the lead story on my local news tonight. No, not a Sinclair-owned station. There is a myth that floats around that farmers are actually really rich because they have nice trucks. It's bullshit. It's called buying a new truck on credit because you need something reliable to manage the farm. And, I would challenge anyone to go shopping for the heavy equipment, seed, and well pesticides that you need to produce large enough yields per acre to eek out a living in the globalized agricultural market and then tell me that farmers are doing well. The truth is that most American farmers barely squeek by, even those with large farms. Most of those with small farms don't make any money and have off-farm jobs. Many are teachers. We love rural America's teachers now, right?\n\nSo, anyway, soy prices dropped 46 cents today. That's a big deal around here. We're already in a drought and the agricultural extension offices were already telling people to expect the next few years to be really bad. People could really go belly up and lose their family farms over this. That doesn't just hurt them. It hurts the people in the communities that rely on them.\n\nNo, not everyone here is a Trump-voting chud. We have our good people. Remember, socialists care about everyone and not just fellow socialists. Don't let this sub go shitlib and root for the destruction of rural America.\n\nThanks for listening.","subreddit":"ChapoTrapHouse","title":"[PSA] Do not laugh at or wish harm on people in Trump country because of the Tariffs""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"[PSA] Do not laugh at or wish harm on people in Trump country because of the Tariffs"}

{"author":"TonyDiGerolamo","created_utc":1522986576,"num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"So as some of you may or may not know, I make [webcomics](http://www.thewebcomicfactory.com/) and I'm not at all shy [getting political](http://www.thewebcomicfactory.com/comic/the-antiwar-comic-protecting-friends/) about it.  One of my fellow creators is a fellow who makes [Existential Comics](https://existentialcomics.com/), a webcomic I actually enjoy, that talks about and makes fun of philosophy in a weird and quirky way.  (Totally recommend you check it out and please do not harass him or do anything on my behalf. That's not what this is about.)\n\nHe has a twitter account and I found it fun to banter with his fans, many of whom are Socialists, Marxists and Communists, much like the folks at various censored subreddits.  Some are very angry and humorless, while many are just woefully ignorant of economics.\n\nI had recently been on a thread with a fan who had the word \"Marxist\" in his avatar screen name.  I had made a flip comment.  Someone had said something like \"Millennials are turning to Communism in droves\" to which I responded something like, \"That's easy, when you've been indoctrinated by Neo-Marxists\" or something like that.\n\nAnyhow, the Marxist asked me to define Neo-Marxism, which I immediately concluded was just baiting me.  He had the word \"Marxist\" in his avatar Twitter name, clearly HE already knew the definition, so there was only one reason he was asking me---\n\nTo tell me I didn't know what I was talking about and flip the script so instead of discussing why Millennials are turning Commie or why one might believe they're being indoctrinated into Neo-Marxist ideology---  The debate could then laser focus on how I couldn't know what I was possibly talking about since, I assume, my definition of Neo-Marxism would be woefully inadequate.\n\nI instead replied with the link to the Wikipedia page.  Not good enough, he wanted MY definition of Neo-Marxism.  I replied that I thought the request was inherently dishonest since I suspected he knew the definition and merely wanted to tell me how ignorant I was.  He ignored that and continued to press for me to define NM, giving the impression that it was an innocent request and that it was merely for my benefit to sound more credible.  I kept refusing his request and the thread faded, as they always did.\n\nNow, I've been blocked by the Existential Comics Twitter account.  Which is funny, because in a previous thread, I was pointing out to the same crowd how the subreddits here that are Socialist, Communists, etc. are heavily censored, implying that this is, in fact, a thing that people in these ideologies eventually do because it cannot be defended successfully in fair and open debate.  The commie comic fans told me how wrong I was.\n\nSo I found it both kind of sad and ironic that I was banned, especially since Existential Comics like to poke fun (at least I thought it was fun) at Libertarian ideas, but I think now that he's looking for more of an echo chamber than a discussion.   (The creator did not engage.  It was just the fans.)\n\nI don't think I was rude or demeaning (unless you count my flip comments about Venezuela and Communism in general).  But it seems they would rather go \"lalalala\" with their fingers in their ears than have discussion of ideas.  \n\nJust wanted to share.  Let me state again that I am NOT looking for anyone to go bombard the Twitter account or anything like that.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Come and listen to a story about arguing with Socialists, Marxists and Communists..."}

{"author":"Think01st","created_utc":1522993204,"num_comments":4,"score":1,"selftext":"Hi!  A bit of background:  I'm Ancap at heart, but I do vote and don't want to scare people, so I generally present myself as Libertarian.\n\nA while ago, I was mildly interested in signing up on a dating site.  Looking to see if there were any dating sites catering to people with my very rare political views, I stumbled across the following posts, all of which are unfortunately closed to comments now (which is why I'm making a new post and cross-posting for all three subs):\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/1gdhhj/ancap_dating_poll/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GoldandBlack/comments/508zac/anarchist_dating_site/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/4n7xt9/so_apparently_there_are_libertarian_dating/\n\nI've finally taken the plunge and tried out several sites.  Some have been much more promising than others.  Hopefully, my experiences will help someone else!\n\nBest to worst, here they are:\n\n---\n\nOkCupid:\n\nhttps://www.okcupid.com/\n\nThis is my favorite so far!  OkCupid does not have a political category for us to check a box with, but its search tool is very powerful.  You can narrow your list of matches by many different filters, including -- here's what'll help politically -- ''interest'' (under the ''more'' tab).\n\nTyping an interest in this window scans profiles across the whole site to see who has mentioned the search term.  This does have have the effect of also bringing up people who say ''I won't date a Libertarian'' when you search on ''Libertarianism,'' FYI, but that's still useful information to have (and pretty rare, only run into it two or three times).\nAnother note about the process is that as you start typing, it'll ''guess'' what you're trying to say and not let you say anything similar; for example, there isn't an ''Ancap'' option, but it does have ''Anarcho-capitalism.''  Also, it handily shows you how many people mention that search term in their profile (I've included some current numbers below).\n\nThough you can use this feature concurrently with many other filters, you can only search on one ''interest'' at a time.  I leave my interest filter on ''Libertarianism'' by default, and seem to get a couple new matches every week, which is great!  So I sign in once a week to check my matches, and do a run-through where I change the interest I'm looking for to check all the different ideologies I'm aware of that I'd be willing to date.  For your benefit, I've listed some (with the ''population'' numbers from the last time I checked) below:\n\nLibertarianism (4,621 people -- I once saw this number grow by 15 people in one day!)\nLibertarian Party (60 people)\nNon-Aggression Principle (44)\nAnarcho-Capitalism (45)\nVoluntaryism (59)\nAgorism (39)\nAnti-Statism (8)\nMinarchists (37)\nMinarchism (8)\n\nAdditionally, for those willing to pay, you can search the whole site on the answers to specific optional questions.  Oh, I love the questions!  Even as a free user, you can answer and view them (you just can't search the whole site based on them).  OkCupid has tons of questions that really matter, related to politics, religion, worldview, financial outlook, sexuality, childrearing, fun stuff and personal tastes, even something like intelligence tests.  You have to answer a question to view another person's answer to it (unless you are willing to pay money), and you can tell if they have a problem with your answer (your answer will be red if they've marked that they would prefer their match not answer that way).\n\nAnd people do answer them!  OkCupid profiles are the most consistently and fully filled out that I've seen anywhere.  Most of the men I've seen there really seem interested in explaining who they are, and they tend to answer questions, too.  OkCupid encourages this by not having a character limit on your entries.  Bravo!\n\n- What's free:  having and viewing full profiles (including questions and photos), a powerful search tool, quality, plenty of like-minded people (adding more every week), messaging, helpful tech support.  Best deal ever.\n\n- What you have to pay for:  searching the whole site for people who answer questions in specific ways, seeing the answers to questions you haven't answered, seeing read receipts on your messages, seeing who ''likes'' you (which makes it easier to see if someone that doesn't show up in your search results, but might actually be a good match for you, has tried to contact you)\n\n- Ideal users:  picky people like me; people who want to know a bit more about someone before reaching out; people who appreciate getting quality for free\n\n---\n\neHarmony:\n\nhttps://www.eharmony.com/\n\n''Libertarian'' is an option you can select to describe yourself!  You might also be ''very'' or ''somewhat'' ''liberal'' or ''conservative,'' or ''impossible to label,'' unless you ''don't know/don't have any'' political opinions or leave it blank.  But there is nothing more fine-grained than that.\nI've gotten the feeling that these options might not be the same provided to users in other countries (I'm in the U.S.), though.\nFurthermore, you cannot filter your matches based on these responses (though they're easy to see on profiles).  You CAN filter based on religion (works consistently) and age (does NOT work consistently, but is usually close when it messes up), among a few other things.  You also can't search for anything except a name or location (probably so you can find a specific match you noticed at some point and want to find again).\n\nLike OkCupid, eHarmony has extra questions you can answer, and you must answer a question to view the other person's answer.  Fewer of the questions have to do with ideology or other really serious topics, but enough do to get a better idea of the people who choose to answer them.  You could call eHarmony's style ''shy'' and OkC's ''direct.''\n\nFewer people seem to write high-quality, informative profiles on eHarmony than they do on OkCupid, though some certainly do.  I blame this partly on the fact that eHarmony limits the character count of your entries.  While this can make people choose what's really important to them to say, I think the chilling effect on real self-expression outweighs any benefit.\n\neHarmony will give you about 12-15 new matches a day.  These matches are chosen based on an extensive personality test (There's something to be said for this, but I personally found some of the questions kind of irrelevant) and whatever (limited) filters you choose to add.\n\n- What's free: building your own profile, reading the profiles of your matches, sending icebreaker questions and smiles\n\n- What you have to pay for:  ability to write messages to people (except during free-messaging promotions, there seem to be a few of those per year), ability to see their photos (at any time), tech support (even when paid it's a bit tricky to access, but once you get to them, they're helpful), ''incognito mode'' which allows you to view someone's profile without them receiving a message that you viewed it.\n\n- Ideal users:  people looking for a personality test match over an ideology match; other people who are willing to work around that structure and pay some money to use an okay-quality, extremely well-known site\n\n---\n\nApplytodate:\n\nhttps://applytodate.com/\n\nThere's good and bad about this fledgling-seeming site.  I hope they keep developing it, because there are some interesting concepts at play.\nEverything about it is free (so far), so instead I'll break this down into those pros and cons.\n\n- What's good:  Once you make your profile, you can post it anywhere, and even non-users can see it!\nFor example:\nhttps://applytodate.com/e\nBAM!  There's me.\nThis ability to post your profile wherever you think it will be seen by the right people (any suggestions where?  Still trying to think of some) is so unique and powerful.  People in your target audience don't have to commit to making a profile, or even think they're interested in meeting someone online, in order to see you.  They can see you and THEN feel driven to do all that if they actually want to contact you.  Such a cool, different approach.\n\nAnother fun feature (in my opinion -- I'm sure it won't be for everyone) is that the service makes users play ''matchmaker'' in order to view matches themselves.  Crowdsourcing the matching function through gamification!  Smart.  Also, I've always kind of wanted to be a matchmaker, so this is almost too fun for me.  Besides, you can totally poach interesting people from it and ''apply'' to them yourself...\n\nIt's easy to toggle your page from live to not live -- just a button -- great for if you find someone or decide against the whole thing for whatever reason!\nThey also apparently hide your profile from search engine crawlers by default, unlike any other free service I'm aware of.\n\n- What's bad:  Not searchable at all.  Few users, including extremely few clear libertarian-types, so far.  Almost everyone using it at this time is in California -- this isn't a bad thing in and of itself, it's just that since it's highly localized right now, it won't be for everyone.\n\nIf I could sign up over again, I would DEFINITELY not indicate my location -- I'm only ever given matches the service considers local to me, which (right now) means only the same three people, over and over and over again (oh, yeah -- you also can't make it so matches you're not interested in don't appear again).  Also (big problem because I'm about to move), I don't seem able to change that location.\nA related issue:  tech support/feedback is not very communicative.\n\nDoes not have a log out or sign out button.  I have to clear my history/cookies before it stops recognizing me.\n\nYou're required to link at least one social media account in order to contact anyone.  For those who compartmentalize their online life or don't use social media so much, this is a bit annoying.  I ended up making a throwaway Instagram I'll never use.  *Shrug*\nSimilarly, the contact methods you can choose for your matches to see are limited to social media or texting.  I have a workaround for those who care -- you can put your email address instead of your phone number for texting, if you want!  (At least, this seems to work for now...)\n\nFinally, minor typos not made by the user might occur.  So far, these are restricted to missing spaces.  While I'm still able to edit my profile on a larger scale, for some reason, I can't seem to add back spaces where they've been randomly deleted.  I'm not even talking about extra spaces that usually disappear in HTML, so this really doesn't make sense to me.  It's a minor issue overall, though.\n\n- Ideal users:  people who want to reach out to those who might not already be using a dating site; people who dream of finding someone who lives in or otherwise personifies Silicon Valley; people who could find love in someone's Twitter feed; matchmakers.\n\n---\n\nMatch.com:\n\nYou can search using tons of filters, ranging from politics and religion to how often they exercise to whether they have a dog, but your only political choices are:  ''very liberal,'' ''liberal,'' ''middle of the road,'' ''conservative,'' ''ultra conservative,'' ''non-conformist'' or ''some other viewpoint.''  No keyword search.  Frustrating to the point of not being worth it for me (as are the sites that follow in this post).\n\nAdditionally, you can ''only'' search for a match within 5000 miles.  If you were in Mexico, for example, you would be able to find a match almost anywhere in the Americas, but you'd never know if someone perfect for you was in Spain.  This makes it bad for people who travel a lot, or who are really picky about hard-to-find things, but not location.  You can easily change the location of your search, though; I just don't consider this user-friendly.\n\nCustomer service did answer questions I had about the terms/privacy policy, so that's in their favor.\n\n- What's free: making a full profile, viewing the full profiles of others (including pictures)... just poking your head in and seeing what's around.  You can also ''wink'' at someone.\n\n- What you have to pay for:  sending and receiving messages, removing matches from your search\n\n- Ideal users:  People who are picky about some things, but not about those important subtleties within ''non-conformist,'' ''ultra conservative,'' or ''other'' political labels\n\n---\n\nLibertarian Passions / Passions Network:\n\nhttps://libertarianpassions.com/\n\nCustomer service is great and prompt, and you can mark if you are a libertarian (though this gets buried in a messy profile setup, and won't do you much good, as I explain below).\n\nBut this is just one sub-site in a HUGE network of other special interest sites.  Users of ALL of these sites are pooled.  (You can opt-out of which sites you want your profile displayed on.)\n\nThis wouldn't be SO bad, except the network isn't searchable based on keyword, or even what sub-site someone originally signed up with.  You can't filter your matches, either, except by gender, orientation, age, weight, height, location, and whether they're looking for dating or friendship.  You can indicate on your profile what you're looking for in much more detail than that, but it won't filter for you.\n\nAlmost all users have extremely bare, low-information profiles.  Lots of people are looking for something very casual.\n\nAll this works together to portray the average match as someone who probably doesn't know or care what libertarianism is, and therefore didn't opt-out from being displayed there.  Far from being a way to meet like-minded people...\n\nAlso, it only shows you people within a maximum of 1000 miles of a given location.  This isolates most of Alaska from anywhere else in the U.S., for example.  Not great for people who travel or otherwise don't care where on the planet their match might be living.  You can change the location, though, but the finer grain makes this even less user-friendly than Match if you don't mind starting out long distance.\n\n- What's free: make and view full profiles, including pictures; can communicate with and ''like'' a limited number of matches per day\n\n- What you have to pay for:  hiding your profile from search engine crawlers (it is cool that this is even an option, though), photos displayed larger, ''incognito'' mode, fewer ads, can see who ''likes'' them, can ''like'' and communicate with more people per day, other minor improvements\n\n- Ideal users:  People looking for dates with someone local who might tolerate them, or might not actually have a clue what they're talking about; people who are fine with picking up each piece of hay looking for a needle that might not even be in there.\n\n---\n\nChristian Mingle:\n\nhttps://www.christianmingle.com/en-us\n\nBecause my faith is even more important to me than my politics, I was very interested in seeing what the situation was here.  Unfortunately, their terms of service and privacy policy were not acceptable to me.  Things might change, but when I read the terms/policy, it seemed like they were willing to share my information in personally identifiable ways for whatever purpose they chose.  Not cool with me; as a result, I have no idea how easy it is to find libertarians, etc. there.\n\n- What's free:  not even sure, I stopped reading\n\n- What you have to pay for:  ?\n\n- Ideal users:  at present... Christians who don't read legally binding documents\n\n---\n\nSo, has anything worked?  Yes and no:\n\n- No, because at the time of this writing, I'm still single.  I'm patient, though.  Also, many of you will have far better luck than me, simply due to my being and looking for a rare subset of a rare subset of rare people.\n\n- Yes, because this experience has shown me that there really are people out there I'd be interested in and compatible with.  I would never have imagined there were so many if I hadn't tried this.  Filled with hope, I only wish I'd started earlier.\n\nWhat are your success and horror stories with dating sites (or finding a like-minded person offline)?  Any suggestions?\n\nI hope everyone that wants to finds someone special!\n\nBe excellent to each other,\nThink01st","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The Libertarian Ally's Guide to Dating Sites (Cross-posted on: GoldandBlack, Anarcho_Capitalism, Christian_Ancaps)"}

Rural or suburban residents are less dependent on the actions of those around them. For someone who lives in a city, the small inconveniences of someone who wants to do things their own way are much more likely to be encountered.\n\nTake a controversial topic like gun ownership. In a rural community, you are more likely to interact with people you know,and to a certain degree, can trust or at least predict. In a city, you mostly interact with strangers. And in a city, one incident - like a lone gunman - can not only kill or harm way more people in a short span, but also disrupt thousands or even millions of people for days or weeks. This is the same for any \"out of the ordinary\" behaviour. It makes sense that people in a city would prefer certain rules to be in place to enable everyone else to live their lives as freely as possible. What do you think of this idea?

{"author":"Cualkiera67","created_utc":1523198044,"num_comments":29,"score":0,"selftext":"There once was a prosperous kingdom ruled by a tyrannical monarch. He would force the peasants to do his bidding, denying them freedom of enterprise, demanding taxation, imposing his own personal brand of justice.\n\nYet, an age of abundance brought by many external factors allowed the oppressed peasants to access some education. And not so much later they began getting together, organizing, discussing, until they started a rebellion against the brutal tyranny of the unjust King. And for the King to be replaced by a new, ideal form of society, Libertarianism. A land were each man had the right to own his property. Were individual rights reign supreme, and not the iron fist of an arbitrary despot.\n\nThe rebellion quickly gained critical mass, with every village and even every battalion of soldiers joining in. It was not long until they arrived to the King's Castle gates, were the royal guards, now libertarians, let them in to the Throne Room.\n\n**\"Behold** -said the democratically elected spokesman of the peasants- **this is the end of your backwards ways. No longer shall the little man suffer under the oppression of the government. We will choose what business we shall undertake. We won't pay your villainous tax. We will decide ourselves the laws and rights of every citizen, in the name of individual freedom. You are no King of ours!\"**\n\nThe King, clearly seeing the gravity of the situation, complied. Descending from his throne, and bowing low, he agreed:\n**\"Of course. I can see you have found the true way. How blind had I been! Monarchy has no place in the new world. I can only hope to take part in this new society, one which I'm sure will bring about endless innovation, efficiency, freedom and wealth, guided by the invisible hand of the Free Market.\"**\nNot a fool, the King had studied the radical ideas of the peasants as they rebelled.\n\n**\"I hereby abolish the Monarchic Dynasty, and renounce as King. Let ye bring about a new and better country for all\"** he proclaimed, as he set aside his crown.\n\nContent with the bloodless change they had accomplished, the peasants started to leave, ready to create a new society. But as they were about to exit the Throne Room, the not-King spoke one last time.\n\n**\"Of course, I *will* keep the crown. It belonged to my father, and his father before him. It is a family heirloom. It is my *propierty*. A concept of utmost importance in this new society\"** He sat back on the throne, and continued, now with a more haughty tone **\"Come to think about it, the castle belongs to me as well. I ordered the attack on the old Lord that lived here. I commanded the troops, I provided the weapons and siege engines. It is mine by all rights.\"**\n\n**\"And the windmill too, you see. I financed its construction from my very own coffers. Those bridges as well. Is a man not entitled to the fruit of his own effort?\"**\n\n**\"I think I have the titles to all those lands, rivers, forests, mountains and beaches here somewhere as well. I inherited them from my father, some of them, and bought and conquered the rest\"**\n\n**\"But don't worry. You can live in my lands. I will only charge you a small rent. Not taxation, as that would be theft\"** he added with a chuckle **\"Since they are my lands, I will have to ask you to follow a few rules that I as landlord have the right to demand\"** he continued **\"You can work for me as well! Harvest my crops, guard my towns, mine my quarries... if you want to. Yes, I believe this new world will work out just fine!\"**\n\nAs the citizens listened, somewhat confused, the Owner added **\"And if you don't like it, you are always free to leave. Freedom will always exist here. There are other fertile lands out there. I'm not sure if the other Kingdoms will welcome your radical ways, but you're free to ask them!\"**\n\nThe citizens left to draft a new constitution. Many had thought of rushing home to proclaim that this and that was their property, to fence up a parcel or two, and to decorate them with little signs that read \"No trespassing\". But now they were rushing to the windmill, to the mine, to the cornfield, to be first in line for a job for the Owner.\n\nMeanwhile, at his Castle, the Owner admired himself in the mirror. What a wonderful new world. A new age of cooperation, free association, market efficiency, were everyone can rise above his peers, to be one of the elite, just like he did. Such entrepreneurs would guide those poor lazy bottom feeders into wealth and happiness. A bit of it at least. Job creators like himself.\n\n*The end*\n\n\n\nThe point is, freedom is meaningless if pre-freedom property is allowed to stay were it was. Crony capitalism implies crony property. To me, the essence of Libertarianism is LEGITIMATE private property.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The King of the Libertarians"}

{"author":"dcman00000","created_utc":1523276015,"num_comments":4,"score":6,"selftext":"#INTRO\n\n\nThe Idea of this post is to lay bare many of the myths surrounding free market healthcare, and to give a factual and persuasive counter argument to the alternatives promoted.  Fallacies abound throughout many discussions on healthcare and as one is being argued against in the real world, yet more are springing forth in the fertile minds of imperfect human beings. I hope to bring a desperately needed and unfortunately rare counter argument to single payer systems or government sponsored systems. Although I endeavored to cover as many topics as possible, there are doubtless multitudes of others worthy of debate, and I encourage additional support or rebuttal in the comments section.\n\nI believe that the U.S healthcare system is factually superior to alternatives and would benefit from *more* free market reform. \n\n\nFirst we must ask ourselves, how do we measure success in healthcare? By cost? Life expectancy? Survival rates? Access to care? Number of healthcare workers and devices (eg: MRI's)? By research and innovation? Attractiveness for entry of new healthcare workers? To say nothing of immeasurables like patient choice, comfort, responsive bureaucracy, and Tort vs No fault systems. What about healthcare simply as a right? What about profit? We will cover these all as much as possible given the format.\n\nAnd so we begin\n\n\n-----\n\n\n# Operational Definitions\n\n\n[Operational definitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_definition#Academic_discipline) are often used in the sciences as a part of the scientific method. It clarifies variables and often makes them testable, and is especially useful when qualitative data is used. Here we will define *Free Market Healthcare* along with *Single Payer Healthcare*. \n\n* Free Market Healthcare: In a system of free-market healthcare, prices for healthcare goods and services are set freely by agreement between patients and health care providers, and the laws and forces of supply and demand are free from any intervention by a government, price-setting monopoly, or other authority. Taken from [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market_healthcare)\n\n* Single Payer Healthcare: Single-payer healthcare is a healthcare system financed by taxes that covers the costs of essential healthcare for all residents, with costs covered by a single public system. Taken from [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer_healthcare)\n\n**Note:** There are different versions of each type of healthcare in the definitions provided above, about which you can read [Here](http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/health_care_systems_four_basic_models.php). I believe that I have narrowed down the definitions to their essential differences, namely the difference between free market competitive forces without government intervention on the one hand and monopsonistic practices on the part of government on the other hand. \n\nSo, how do we measure success in either system? What follows is a list of possible ways to measure the success of each system. \n\n-----\n\n# Cost\n\nMany of you may already be privy to [the](http://www.oecd.org/health/healthspendingcontinuestooutpaceeconomicgrowthinmostoecdcountries.htm) fact that the United States spends far more per capita on healthcare than every other nation in the OECD. The first thing we must note (from the article just linked) is that healthcare spending is increasing faster than economic growth *across the entire OECD*. This fact means that over time healthcare spending will constitute an ever growing share of industrialized economies, whether or not they have free market healthcare or single payer systems. The [OECD](http://www.oecd.org/health/healthcarecostsunsustainableinadvancedeconomieswithoutreform.htm) points to the following as the culprit:\n\n&gt;  Upward pressure on health spending comes from new technology in medical services, rising incomes driving higher expectations, and the growing needs of ageing populations.\n\nFurthermore, we must not confuse *prices* with *costs*. In an economic sense, prices are those points at which things like money are exchanged, and costs are those things that may have been produced as alternatives to production of one good or service over another. I speak of course of the difference between [Prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price) and [*opportunity costs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost). Remember that opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs: the real cost of output forgone, lost time, pleasure or any other benefit that provides utility should also be considered an opportunity cost. We must not confuse these two terms, for they are two entirely different things as we will see. \n\nAlthough the United States pays a higher *Price* per capita, it is not at all clear or a forgone conclusion that its *costs* are higher. Indeed, many single payer systems have non-price related costs that are higher than in the United States. A prime example of this is higher wait [times](https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/high-priced-pain-what-expect-single-payer-health-caresystem) even for [medically necessary services](http://freebeacon.com/issues/waiting-times-for-canadas-single-payer-health-care-system-hit-record-high/). This is a forgone conclusion because the *costs* of a good or service cannot be side stepped or controlled like *prices* can be.\n\nThis segues into rationing. In a free market system goods and services are rationed by the price system. When the price system no longer functions properly, as is the case through government monopsonistic practices, price ceilings and floors, and other interventions, then other forms of rationing become prevelant. [Other](http://webnt.calhoun.edu/distance/internet/business/eco231/downloads/lnc4.pdf) types of rationing include waiting lines, grants of official permission, tie-in sales, political power, and personal characteristics. These other kinds of costs are hard to quantify, and usually do NOT show up in statistics that allegedly give a full accounting of the cost of healthcare. \n\nThe single payer system also has other hidden costs. A monopoly is when there is one seller and many buyers, a monopsony is when there is one buyer and many sellers (Hence \"single payer\"). Being that a single payer system is a monopsony, it incurs costs on the economy commensurate with its market structure. The [welfare and deadweight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopsony#Welfare_implications) costs on an economy are difficult to account for, but are very real costs imposed on an economy through this type of market structure. \n\n[There](http://ushealthpolicygateway.com/vii-key-policy-issues-regulation-and-reform/p-health-reform/national-health-reform/single-payer/#What_Are_the_Deadweight_Losses_Associated_with_Single_Payer) have been attempts at accounting for deadweight loss in the U.S economy from adopting the Bernie Sanders \"Medicare for all plan\". \n\n&gt;Conover (2017) estimates the deadweight losses from the additional new taxes required by the Sanders Medicare-for-All plan would range from $625 billion to $1.1 trillion.\n\nSo we see that, at the very least, we cannot rely on the price to assess the success of healthcare primarily because the much lower *prices* of single payer healthcare conceal tremendous *costs* on individuals and the economy. \n\n\n-----\n\n\n# Life Expectancy\n\nIf you take a look and [compare](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en#!ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:CAN:USA:DEU:GBR:ESP:FRA:DNK:JPN&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en_US&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false) life expectancy in the U.S vs other industrialized nations it indeed shows the U.S slightly below that of other comparable countries. Leaving aside the fact that a supposedly far inferior system in the U.S performs just about as well in life expectancy as single payer systems, we have on major problem with relying on this statistic. Namely, socioeconomic differences, especially in the United States. \n\nA [quick](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/life-expectancy-by-re/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) glance at the information on life expectancy shows wide variations by race, ethnicity, and region. Asian Americans lead the overall pack at (86.5), Latino(82.8), Whites (78.9), Native Americans (76.9), and African Americans(74.6). This does not correlate well with wealth or income considering Latinos are the poorest overall [households](https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2017/09/11/median-wealth-of-black-and-latino-families-could-hit-zero-before-the-centurys-end/) in the United States. This strongly implies that there is little to no correlation between wealth and life expectancy in the United States. \n\n&gt; middle quintile White households have nearly 8 times as much wealth as median Black households and 10 times as much as Latino households.\n\nThis is, ostensibly, with an inferior healthcare system. If we use Latinos and Asians, who can be said to both suffer from discrimination and also cannot be more different in terms of education and wealth, then they would be among the healthiest citizens in the world, with U.S asians having a modest lead as the healthiest people on the [planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy). Again, I bring this up to dispel the notion that single payer systems produce better results in terms of life expectancy. The truth is that given the right circumstances, as is the case for the Asian population residing in the U.S, The free market system performs wonderfully. \n\n\nSo why the difference? \n\nhttp://www.businessinsider.com/huge-racial-gap-in-life-expectancy-2014-1\n\n\n\n&gt; In a 2013 report, the CDC investigated persistent causes for the racial gap in life expectancy in more detail.\"Higher death rates due to heart disease, cancer, homicide, diabetes, and perinatal conditions\" accounted for 60 percent of the gap, the report noted. The report goes on to say that the gap would have been even larger \"if not for the lower death rates for the black population for suicide, unintentional injuries, and chronic lower respiratory diseases.\"\n\n\nAnd conclude the following\n\n&gt;  improving educational opportunities may be a key part of making health disparities a thing of the past.\n\n\nIn other words, differences in the ways that people take care of themselves as relates to their health and different lifestyle choices impacted these considerable differences. \n\nIts a stretch to say that lifestyle choices are the result of either single payer or free market healthcare. More likely its a cultural issue, which is beyond the discussion being had here. \n\n\nSo again we see that life expectancy in the aggregate may be a poor indicator of the success of a healthcare system. In the United States we have the one of the healthiest populations on the planet, and that is with a *free market system*. \n\n\n------\n\n\n# Survival Rates\n\nIts true the that [United States](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/mortality-rates-u-s-compare-countries/#item-u-s-relatively-high-mortality-rate-diseases-circulatory-system) has a higher than **average** age adjusted mortality rate for *most* causes of death, but this does not mean that it is absolutely the worst. \n\nNote: As an aside the U.S actually has a *lower* than average age adjusted mortality rate when it comes to cancer.\n\nThe U.S, although above average in for example circulatory diseases, does better than some other countries with single payer systems such as Austria, Germany, and Sweden. \n\nI won't belabor every point in the article I just cited, you could and should at least glance at it for yourself, but the point of *this* section is that survival rates vary across and within countries, and between socioeconomic and ethnic/racial groups. \n\n\n\n----\n\n\n# Access\n\nFirst, a claim made by former President Obama:\n\n&gt; \"There are \u201c46 million uninsured Americans\u201d in May 2009.\"\n\nSo let us start with this number. This implies that the rest of America has access to healthcare (roughly 260 million people as of 2009). \n\nThe Census Bureau put the number at 45,657,000 in 2009. So any claim much higher than this is *probably* false. \n\n9.7 million of that number are not citizens of the United States (this has to do with immigration, which is beyond our discussion)\n\nMore than 17 million of the uninsured make at least $50,000 per year (the median household income of $50,233) \u2013 8.4 million make $50,000 to $74,999 per year and 9.1 million make $75,000 or higher. Two economists working at the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that 25 to 75 percent of those who do not purchase health insurance coverage \u201ccould afford to do so.\u201d\n\n The NationalCenter for Policy Analysis estimates that uninsured people get about $1,500 of free health care per year, or $6,000 per family of four.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office says that 45 percent of the uninsured will be insured within four months. CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin also said that the frequent claim of 40+ million Americans lacking insurance is an \u201cincomplete and potentially misleading picture of the uninsured population.\u201d\n\nCBO analysis found that 36 million people would remain uninsured even if the Senate\u2019s $1.6 trillion health care plan is passed.\n\n\nhttps://www.mrc.org/articles/fact-sheet-americas-uninsured\n\nhttp://www.enttoday.org/article/a-myth-of-modern-medicine-there-are-40-million-americans-with-no-access-to-health-care/\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111651742\n\nThe real number of people who \n\n1. Cannot afford access who need it\n\n2. Do not qualify under some other government program\n\n\nIs actually closer to 12 million people, or about 3.9% of the population as of 2009\n\nIn other words 96.1% of the population is covered or foregoes insurance even though they can afford it or qualify for assistance.\n\nThis is hardly a statistic to get up in arms about. \n\nFurthermore there is great variations between the states and how they run their respective systems, the characteristics of their economies, and the characteristics of their populaces that lead to wide differences in the total number of uninsured within the (https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-population/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Uninsured%22,%22sort%22:%22desc%22%7D)\n\nThis means that *how a healthcare system is run* and its *economy* and the *characteristics of the populace involved* impact uninsured rates. Remember, uninsured doesn't automatically mean \"cannot afford\" or \"will not have healthcare soon\". \n\nAccess to care statistics rarely incorporate all of these facts, and as such we cannot automatically assume that the United States is *substantially* lower on account of access to care than other comparable countries. \n\n----\n\n\n# Number of healthcare workers, MRI's, Cat scanners, etc\n\nThe U.S has the [Second](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282401/density-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-units-by-country/) highest per capita rate of MRI's in the world, [Third](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266539/distribution-of-equipment-for-computer-tomography/) in the world in Cat scanners, And [Well](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.NUMW.P3?locations=US-XD) above the high income countries average in terms of number of nurses and midwives per capita. \n\nSo we've essentially established that the supply of healthcare workers and devices is relatively high in the United States. This is with a free market healthcare system. \n\n\n----\n\n\n# Research and innovation\n\n\nThe U.S produces by far the most new medical [patents](https://www.americanactionforum.org/weekly-checkup/new-drug-patents-country/) than any other country, and its statistics in this measure may actually be underrepresented because of American corporations relocating their headquarters to other countries in order to take advantage of the lower corporate tax rates there. \n\nA study found [that](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2866602/)\n\n&gt; The United States ... was responsible for the development of 43.7% of the NMEs. The United Kingdom, Switzerland, and a few other countries innovated proportionally more than their contribution to GDP or prescription drug spending\n\n\nSo again here we see that the United States far and away leads the world in medical innovation. If a free market system were inferior, it would be hard to see how this would be the case. \n\n\n-----\n\n\n# Unmeasureables\n\nThese are harder to take into account by virtue of the fact that they are hard to quantify. \n\nHowever we may, at the very least, list some of the differences between the U.S and other nations.\n\n\"Tort vs No Fault\" [countries](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2003/olrdata/ins/rpt/2003-R-0885.htm). \n\n&gt;Several medical no-fault systems in medicine operate internationally. Collectively, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and New Zealand have accumulated nearly 80 years of experience in operating administrative systems that replace medical malpractice litigation. Medical no-fault schemes were introduced in New Zealand in 1974, and in Sweden in 1975.\n\n\nOut of 5 countries surveyed on patient comfort, it was a single payer system that finished in [https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.20.3.244], edging out the United States.\n\n ------\n\n\n# What about profit?\n\nIs profit simply extra money paid on top of the base cost of a good or service? Would we be better off on a system that eliminated profit from the healthcare system altogether? \n\n\nFirst, we must understand what profits do, and where they come from. \n\n\nPrices convey a tremendous amount of [information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPy-QKXofQs) without each person having to have a near infinite knowledge on the instantaneously and continuously changing economy in order to produce the right amount of goods and services, at the right time, and at the right place. \n\nProfits are merely a subset of prices, and act much in the same way. Profits tell suppliers of goods and services, where to produce, what to produce, and how to produce it. This is an incredibly efficient way of allocating and distributing resources, at least compared to other known [methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem). \n\n\nThis gets into [Trade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0gGyeA-8C4) theory.What we can distill this down to is that profit doesn't equate to higher prices, especially in competitive markets where trade is freely allowed. In general economic actors wouldn't trade Goods and services unless they generally thought they were going to be better off afterwards than before. \n\n\nyou can read a little bit more about [Profits here.](https://www.tutor2u.net/economics/reference/functions-of-profit) \n\n\n-----\n\n\n# healthcare as a right?\n\n\nThe U.N universal declaration of human rights says the [following](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/)\n\n&gt; Article 25. (1) Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the **health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care** and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.\n\n\n\nThe [Soviet Constitution of 1977](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_Soviet_Constitution#Constitutional_rights) Said the following: \n\n&gt; the Constitution also granted social and economic rights not provided by constitutions in some capitalist countries. Among these were the rights to work, rest and leisure, **health protection**, care in old age and sickness, housing, education, and cultural benefits\n\n\nWe must define two terms first, then move on.\n\nPositive rights: \n\n&gt;the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service...while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right (Narveson 2001)\n\n\nNegative Rights: \n\n&gt; The holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference...A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right\n\n\n\nhttps://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/#2.1\n\n\n\nThe problem with positive rights that...\n\n&gt; Negative rights can be respected simply by each person refraining from interfering with each other, while it may be difficult or even impossible to fulfill everyone's positive rights if the sum of people's claims outstrips the resources available.\n\n\nIn most cases, both negative and positive rights are normative in principle, and as such have no relation to underlying dynamics like a system of economics. What I mean by this is that since positive rights, like a right to healthcare, Have to contend with underlying dynamics of supply, demand, market structure, deadweight loss, welfare costs, and many of the other problems we have discussed thus far. A positive right is therefore constrained by the conditions of dynamic systems upon which the right is to be extracted. Furthermore, positive rights often require a duty on a second or third party, which tramples on their negative rights. \n\nA negative right, like a right to free speech, is not constrained by an underlying dynamic So long as you are free from coercion. In addition to that negative rights like free speech do not trample on the rights of others, it requires no duties on other agents. \n\n\nSo can healthcare *truly* be an affirmative right as a workable theory? I say no, because it is often unworkable from its own constraints and also requires duties on others which interferes with their negative rights.\n\nCountries that have declared healthcare as a right in the form of universal coverage via single payer systems have trampled on the negative rights of others, and are unworkable so in far as they are constrained by underlying dynamics...which in this case means economics. \n\n\n\n-----\n\n# Proposed reforms to U.S healthcare\n\n\nSo you must be wondering, do I think the U.S healthcare system is perfect? Absolutely not. It could use for some major reform in the direction of more free markets.\n\nhere are some proposed solutions\n\n* Allow importation of drugs and medical services/devices (huge Deal)\n* Allow competition across state lines for health insurance (Huge deal)\n* End the practice where local hospitals can veto the establishment of new hospitals ( Called Certificates of public need)\n* reduce or streamline the licensing requirements for certain healthcare practitioners\n* End all taxes on medicine and healthcare\n* Change from allowing companies to have 20 year monopolies after a drug is designed to instead have a bounty system allowing generics and name brand competitors to compete right away.\n* reduce the threshold for over the counter drugs\n* Increase immigration for healthcare workers and doctors especially\n* Allow for tax privileged health savings accounts that can be used for yourself or family members (can be invested in equities).\n* Get rid of all price caps and price controls so that the *long term* supply equilibrium is met, stabilizing costs. \n* implement policies that increase full employment so that people can more likely afford healthcare through policies like eliminating the corporate tax, reducing income taxes, and getting rid of capital gains taxes and estate taxes.\n\n\n------\n\n\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\n\nI believe when compared to single payer systems, free market healthcare is clearly superior. I believe this because Prices and costs are not the same thing, and costs and deadweight loss are hidden in single payer systems. I believe this because Life expectancy for certain groups in the United States are among the highest in the world. I believe this because Survival rates for most diseases are adequate, and the worst performers are single payer systems. I believe this because Access to care in the United States is very very high. I believe this because the number of healthcare workers in the U.S and the supply of advanced medical devices is among the highest in the world. I believe this because The U.S is the worlds leading medical innovator. I believe this because the U.S has tort laws that allow patients to sue for compensation for damages. I believe this because the profit system is indispensable in its function in the economy, and its ability to allocate resources is unmatched. And finally I believe this because I do not believe, unfashionable as it may sound, that healthcare can in *actuality* be a right.

So don't bother with that ridiculous argument. Thanks.\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n&gt; Composed by Adolf Hitler in 1920, the 25 Points outlines the political platform of the Nazi Party and remained mostly unchanged from 1920 through Hitler's demise in 1945.\n\n\n1. We demand the union of all Germans in a Great Germany on the basis of the principle of self-determination of all peoples.\n\n2. We demand that the German people have rights equal to those of other nations; and that the Peace Treaties of Versailles and St. Germain shall be abrogated.\n\n3. We demand land and territory (colonies) for the maintenance of our people and the settlement of our surplus population.\n\n4. Only those who are our fellow countrymen can become citizens. Only those who have German blood, regardless of creed, can be our countrymen. Hence no Jew can be a countryman.\n\n5. Those who are not citizens must live in Germany as foreigners and must be subject to the law of aliens.\n\n6. The right to choose the government and determine the laws of the State shall belong only to citizens. We therefore demand that no public office, of whatever nature, whether in the central government, the province, or the municipality, shall be held by anyone who is not a citizen.\n\nWe wage war against the corrupt parliamentary administration whereby men are appointed to posts by favor of the party without regard to character and fitness.\n\n7. We demand that the State shall above all undertake to ensure that every citizen shall have the possibility of living decently and earning a livelihood. If it should not be possible to feed the whole population, then aliens (non-citizens) must be expelled from the Reich.\n\n8. Any further immigration of non-Germans must be prevented. We demand that all non-Germans who have entered Germany since August 2, 1914, shall be compelled to leave the Reich immediately.\n\n9. All citizens must possess equal rights and duties.\n\n10. The first duty of every citizen must be to work mentally or physically. No individual shall do any work that offends against the interest of the community to the benefit of all.\n\nTherefore we demand:\n\n11. That all unearned income, and all income that does not arise from work, be abolished.\n\n12. Since every war imposes on the people fearful sacrifices in blood and treasure, all personal profit arising from the war must be regarded as treason to the people. We therefore demand the total confiscation of all war profits.\n\n13. We demand the nationalization of all trusts.\n\n14. We demand profit-sharing in large industries.\n\n15. We demand a generous increase in old-age pensions.\n\n16. We demand the creation and maintenance of a sound middle-class, the immediate communalization of large stores which will be rented cheaply to small tradespeople, and the strongest consideration must be given to ensure that small traders shall deliver the supplies needed by the State, the provinces and municipalities.\n\n17. We demand an agrarian reform in accordance with our national requirements, and the enactment of a law to expropriate the owners without compensation of any land needed for the common purpose. The abolition of ground rents, and the prohibition of all speculation in land.\n\n18. We demand that ruthless war be waged against those who work to the injury of the common welfare. Traitors, usurers, profiteers, etc., are to be punished with death, regardless of creed or race.\n\n19. We demand that Roman law, which serves a materialist ordering of the world, be replaced by German common law.\n\n20. In order to make it possible for every capable and industrious German to obtain higher education, and thus the opportunity to reach into positions of leadership, the State must assume the responsibility of organizing thoroughly the entire cultural system of the people. The curricula of all educational establishments shall be adapted to practical life. The conception of the State Idea (science of citizenship) must be taught in the schools from the very beginning. We demand that specially talented children of poor parents, whatever their station or occupation, be educated at the expense of the State.\n\n21. The State has the duty to help raise the standard of national health by providing maternity welfare centers, by prohibiting juvenile labor, by increasing physical fitness through the introduction of compulsory games and gymnastics, and by the greatest possible encouragement of associations concerned with the physical education of the young.\n\n22. We demand the abolition of the regular army and the creation of a national (folk) army.\n\n23. We demand that there be a legal campaign against those who propagate deliberate political lies and disseminate them through the press. In order to make possible the creation of a German press, we demand:\n\n(a) All editors and their assistants on newspapers published in the German language shall be German citizens.\n\n(b) Non-German newspapers shall only be published with the express permission of the State. They must not be published in the German language.\n\n(c) All financial interests in or in any way affecting German newspapers shall be forbidden to non-Germans by law, and we demand that the punishment for transgressing this law be the immediate suppression of the newspaper and the expulsion of the non-Germans from the Reich.\n\nNewspapers transgressing against the common welfare shall be suppressed. We demand legal action against those tendencies in art and literature that have a disruptive influence upon the life of our folk, and that any organizations that offend against the foregoing demands shall be dissolved.\n\n24. We demand freedom for all religious faiths in the state, insofar as they do not endanger its existence or offend the moral and ethical sense of the Germanic race.\n\nThe party as such represents the point of view of a positive Christianity without binding itself to any one particular confession. It fights against the Jewish materialist spirit within and without, and is convinced that a lasting recovery of our folk can only come about from within on the pinciple:\n\nCOMMON GOOD BEFORE INDIVIDUAL GOOD\n\n25. In order to carry out this program we demand: the creation of a strong central authority in the State, the unconditional authority by the political central parliament of the whole State and all its organizations.\n\nThe formation of professional committees and of committees representing the several estates of the realm, to ensure that the laws promulgated by the central authority shall be carried out by the federal states.\n\nThe leaders of the party undertake to promote the execution of the foregoing points at all costs, if necessary at the sacrifice of their own lives.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The 25 points of the National Socialist German Workers' Party"}

{"author":"Dr_Jorge","created_utc":1523362912,"num_comments":3,"score":3,"selftext":"Last week marked the 36th anniversary of the Falklands/Malvinas war. So many years later, deaths, deep scars, generations, financial blockades, politicians using them on both sides of the Atlantic and there is no hint of a definitive solution.\n\nArgentina does not accept the islanders in any negotiations. The United Kingdom maintains de facto sovereignty and claims to support the wishes of the islanders. The Falkland/Malvinas islanders made clear in the 2013 Referendum they wanted to remain as an Overseas Territory under British sovereignty. Yet, the referendum was not legal. And the story goes...\n\nI'm originally from Argentina. I currently live in the UK (I've been here for the past 12 years). I have been in touch with Falkland/Malvinas islanders since before 2013. In fact, I supported the 2013 Referendum and I had the opportunity to have some of the islanders writing on my blog. One of my cousins (now dead) fought in the Falklands war in 1982. I don't have any grudge against the UK or the islanders. In fact, I've always wished for a peaceful resolution. \n\nI've been an academic for over 20 years. Publications in English, Spanish and Russian. I've been working on the Falklands/Malvinas case for over a decade. This includes research, writing (academic and non academic), public presentations, and other activities. In all the cases, I've done my best to keep a balanced view and avoid bias.\n\nCan we do anything for peace? A reminder to the reader, this is a series I called TERRITORIAL DISPUTES. I introduced basic conceptual elements and thereafter, I apply a theoretical frame (based on Rawlsian methodology) to solve well-known sovereignty disputes or conflicts. I explore what reasonable people would do in a territorial dispute. This is a theoretical experiment that deals with IDEAL theory only. There is no claim to NON IDEAL theory hence issues like lack of compliance are not explored.\n\nIn order to do it, I assume the representatives of each claiming party (sovereign States and a non-sovereign character) choose a rule based on theory game. I go for the maximin. From there, these ideal people come up with a solution to the conflict.\n\nThese past two weeks I introduced the Falklands/Malvinas' case and applied the Rawlsian methodology to this dispute. Below all the links to all TEN posts from this week. The first four posts have to do with background information related to the dispute itself in order to set the stage for hypothetical negotiations. The fifth post introduce my solution which I call EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY. Posts six to nine deal with borders, defence and natural resources and I argue how cooperation by means of the Egalitarian Shared Sovereignty can work. Post ten brings back reality and argues that this dispute has to do with domestic, regional and international issues at states. My conclusion, this dispute remains because for some (very few) it is more beneficial the status quo. \n\nQuestions for the readers:\n1. Any disagreement with the facts?\n2. Any information or opinion you may want to share?\n3. How can we solve this territorial dispute?\n\nREMINDER Note: I\u2019ll only post on r/Libertarian on Tuesday a summary of what I do weekly on the blog to avoid spamming this sub-reedit as that is not my intention. I only aim to open a healthy discussion. I started with Gibraltar today and I'll start sharing those posts from next week.\n\nComments welcomed. Guest writers would be hugely appreciated. As you may see from the posts Falklands/Malvinas islanders have previously participated. PLEASE I do this with utmost respect to all people in Argentina, the United Kingdom and the Falkland/Malvinas islands. I'd appreciate the same respect in the discussion. I don't claim to have the solution. As I've just mention, I only aim to offer an open floor for discussion.

That is only the case if one presumes the goals there, and here, were peace and stability.  That is not the case.  The goals there were to ensure that no regional power was able to subvert the US control over the resources available.  In those contexts, the threat was first of either Iraq or Iran developing into strong enough regional powers, and later to prevent the rise of a Caliphate State that could do the same.  \n\nFrom the perspective of the US government, this had to be prevented because it could circumvent using US and US ally controlled shipping lanes, which are one of the biggest sources of both income and power projection for the US government.  A strong regional power and local stability could see sufficient cooperation in overland trade between the states there to disrupt that in the area.  From the perspective of the US government, those military interventions were wildly successful.  \n\nNow, with Syria (at least this time around), the threat to the US government is Russia developing enough regional and financial power to do the same.  The relationships may appear somewhat more murky and complex at this point in time, and from our perspective, but maintaining the status quo in terms of the US governments financial hegemony keeping the local and regional powers weak enough to rely upon us militarily - both of which make it easier to maintain this status quo.  \n\nAs citizens of any nation, we should all fear this agenda, but we should also recognize (even if the fact is despicable) that even if the US government were to pull all of their financial and military power projection and influence from this and other regions, other governments would step in to try todo the same to their own benefit.

Conversely, it will be unprofitable to produce wire if its price falls below 65 cents.\n\nPrices convey a tremendous amount of information. Obviously prices dictate how resources are allocated in a society, whether those prices are set by Gosplan or by spontaneous order. \n\nSo, lets stop a minute and take a breath and think about the free market solution to this problem and the alternatives.\n\nWe have the free market solution, which is to let private economic actors make decisions in the marketplace themselves based on their own sets of criteria (Too innumerable to name). This information is translated into prices every time an economic agent makes pretty much any kind of decision in the marketplace (whether to buy or not, at what price, whether to sell or not and at what prices, how much to buy/sell,  when to buy/sell, personal preferences and tastes, opportunity cost considerations etc...to many to name here as well). \n\nAnd we have alternative solutions. I'm going to go ahead and keep things simple by only using the Soviet Model as an alternative where there are still prices, but each is set by a central authority whose job it is to figure out how to allocate resources. Relevant to this discussion is that I once had a flame war with a well educated communist in my early days on Reddit. *His* suggestion for overcoming the economic calculation problem was to survey the people of society for their needs *and then* allocating resources based on that. So lets say we combined the soviet model of Gosplan setting prices with his model and had the added benefit of Gosplan setting prices based on Surveys they conducted.\n\n\nSo lets say this was a simple survey (simple is easier to process for the authorities). It asks, on a scale from 1-10 rate your need or desire for product/service X. It then asks the same question about product/service Y and Z and so on, until all the relevant information of society is collected and processed. Lets leave aside the problems of how long it would take to collect and analyze such a data set and assume that it can be done faster than economic conditions change (Thats a whole other fatal flaw of central planning in regards to price setting). \n\nSo, *in effect*, from this survey we can get a theoretical **minimum** of ten prices for each good or service (scale of 1-10 remember), and the number can go infinitely higher depending on how precise the authorities want their prices to be. \n\nNow remember, Prices are *related to each other*, so each price has to be set in relation to *every other price*. This sets us up with an interesting problem for the central planners. \n\n**Exactly what combination of prices would be best for society and would best allocate scarce resources?**\n\nI wanted to do a quick \"back of the envelope\" calculation to get an idea of how many combinations of prices there could be if there were *only* ten different possible prices (based on the survey method) for the estimated 24 million different price points. You can read about combinatorics yourself [here](https://medium.com/i-math/combinations-permutations-fa7ac680f0ac), which is what I used to arrive at this number. But since prices can repeat, this is a problem of a permutation with repetition (since prices can be the same from good to good)\n\n\nThe Number you ask?\n\n#10^24,000,000\n\n\nFor comparisons sake, it is estimated that there are [10^82](https://www.universetoday.com/36302/atoms-in-the-universe/) **ATOMS** in the observable known universe, and thats the high estimate. \n\nThats how many different price combinations there were in the Soviet Union when it had 24,000,000 different prices. If we get more precise with our pricing system it only gets worse since the base number increases.   \n\n\nThis problem also only gets worse if we start adding price points from additions of people demanding goods (EG: population increase), new and different products etc. This problem also gets worse with the principle that economic conditions change ...for all practical purposes... at an instantaneous rate of change, meaning the Gosplan must update its information continuously, there cannot be gaps in the flow of information otherwise resources will be wasted in proportion to the size (big or small) in the gap of knowledge. \n\n\nI think this sub is educated enough to understand the role of prices, and how they work in general. If you want to understand a little bit more about prices and how the Gosplan model failed, here ya go. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkPGfTEZ_r4\n\nNow the retort \"But we can have a *Super Computer*\" do that work for us. \n\n\n*this is pure fantasy*\n\nleaving aside various problems like the cost of running such a computer, the technology involved, who would program and run it, how would it collect information efficiently and timely etc, we have a huge problem with using A computer to do this job, because even the world current world record holder for fastest computer, \"Sunway TaihuLight\", pales in comparison to the computing power we would need to do such a thing.\n\n[In fact, even *The entire planets computing power* wouldn't be enough to do it either.](https://aiimpacts.org/global-computing-capacity/#Global_computing_capacity_in_terms_of_human_brains)\n\n&gt; According to different estimates, the human brain performs the equivalent of between 3 x 10^13 and 10^25 FLOPS. The median estimate we know of is 1018 FLOPS. According to that median estimate and our estimate of global computing hardware, if the world\u2019s entire computing capacity could be directed at running minds around as efficient as those of humans, we would have the equivalent of 200-1500 extra human minds.7 **That is, turning all of the world\u2019s hardware into human-efficiency minds at present would increase the world\u2019s population of minds by at most about 0.00002%.** If we select the most favorable set of estimates for producing large numbers, turning all of the world\u2019s computing hardware into minds as efficient as humans\u2019 would produce around 50 million extra minds, increasing the world\u2019s effective population by about 1%.\n\n\n\nThe economic calculation problem is much too high a hurdle for central planners to climb over. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The economic calculation problem.

Vohra has apologized and clarified that his intent was to start the conversation by asking: \u201cwhat is the level of tyranny that would be great enough to morally justify using violence in self defense?\u201d\n\nThank you, Mr. Vohra. Given the current climate of gun politics, this question is more important than ever: When is it justified to stage an armed coup against a group of elected, local government administrators? I\u2019m sure the \u201cpragmatic libertarians\u201d would say that local elections, the PTA, homeschooling, charter schools, or filing a lawsuit will help stop any would-be Superintendent Stalins. But is that really enough? If the citizens of Topeka, Kansas had taken action into their own hands, we wouldn\u2019t have needed [*Brown v. Board of Education*]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education).\n\nVohra\u2019s innovative thinking and bold strategies are exactly what the LP needs right now. Democratic Party leaders always complain about how young voters don\u2019t want to engage in the actual groundwork of party activism, they\u2019d rather just write a long, rambling facebook screeds. Well, Mr. Vohra is taking the opposite approach: he\u2019s reaching out to millennials by beating them at their own game!\n\nNot only that, he\u2019s already reaching out to the *next* generation of voters, too. By constantly railing against age-of-consent laws, he\u2019s trying to create party loyalty early, like a modern-day Joe Camel. I\u2019m predicting big gains for the LP in the 2022 midterms, when they\u2019re old enough to vote!\n\nBut in essence, Vohra is safeguarding the purity of the Libertarian Party. He\u2019s ensuring that no Libertarian ever has to violate the non-aggression principle by holding elected office:\n\n* He\u2019s preventing any LP politician from raising taxes, passing new laws, or having a public sex scandal.\n\n* By publicly disparaging US veterans, he\u2019s taking down the Military-Industrial complex. (It\u2019s harder to start a war when the army hates you!)\n\n* The LP will surely never have to worry about \u201cgetting money out of politics.\u201d\n\nSo, after our country is crushed under the yoke of the Two-Party system, the LP will be standing by, eagerly waiting to cast the first stones.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"A modest defense of Arvin Vohra..."}

I was commited to 30 minutes on the eliptical and didn't bring my phone or music player, so I had to just accept the bombardment of mass media \"news\" for the entire time. Fox and CNN were both on, and both had the predictable panels of empty suits reassuring each other that this latest killing episode was for freedom and democracy (always presumed to be a good thing, for which there is no evidence) , and that Assad is of course an evil reprobate who hates children and baseball and kills puppies. Same shit different decade, we've heard it all before. There was a bit of \"discussion\" on what this means for Russia and US relations, with Syria having become a point of deadly contention between the two, for no discernable reason. We all know that the potential exists for life-ending nuclear exchange because of this. The criminal insanity, evil, and wanton stupidity of this circumstance is self evident. How much sense does it make to end life on earth over a vaguely defined conflict, conjured up essentially out of thin air to enrich a small number of hideously evil people? 99% of americans could not possibly find Syria on an unlabeled map of the world (or Iraq, Afghanistan, Ukraine, North Korea, Vietnam, Israel, Iran, etc etc.......) . Yet their lives may end over it and hardly any seem to really care. The existence of large, violent, and utterly unaccountable nation states is just accepted as an unchangeable feature of our world.\n \nBut what if there were no national governments on earth? Would people living in what we call russia not just be people living their lives? Would people in america not just be more people doing the same? The existence of all life on earth would certainly not be threated over a conflict regarding the goings on in a small country that few from either place have ever visited or know anything about. In fact, if there were no national governments, 20 million koreans would have been able to live their full lives rather than being pointlessly murdered half a century ago. A few million Iraqis and Afghans, many of them children, would have been spared from \"freedom and democracy\" turning their house and bodies into flaming, mangled corpses and rubble. Of course, there are dozens more examples from the 20th and 21st centuries alone, most with much higher body counts. \nIn fact, is there ANY case for nations to exist at all? What good are they? What positive effects have they brought to human life? As best I can tell, they are quickly taken over by incomprehensibly evil people, either directly by wearing a military costume or occupying a congressional office, or indirectly sitting on the board of a military contractor or other war profiteer. Democracy doesn't help. America invades every place it can find and happily carries out one murdering spree after another. There is never an option to vote for this to end. In this sense, there is no discernable difference between a democratic nation or a communist nation.\nTonight's events with Syria have left me very depressed. I just can't believe that innocent humans are AGAIN being murdered and will continue to be murdered for the enrichment of an evil few rulers in the government and corporate arenas. I'd give anything to make it stop. The world isn't supposed to be this way.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"If there were no governements...."}

It is an example of invalidating someone's opinion based on a type of guilt by association called [reductio ad hitlerum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum). Whenever someone tries to argue that the nazis were socialist they are implying that socialism is bad simply because Hitler supported it. It could also be applied to other things(animal welfare is bad because hitler supported it, anti-smoking campaigns are bad because hitler supported it). This obviously doesn't make sense, just because Hitler did atrocious things does not automatically mean that he was wrong about everything. Plus, guilt by association is immoral because you are holding people responsible for things they didn't do(BLM hating whites for slavery, Trump banning muslims because of terrorism, feminists labelling all men as rapists, etc). \n\nAlso, anyone who has a basic understanding of economics knows that the Nazis weren't actually socialist. In a socialist economy the government controls the means of production and the distribution of goods, and that was not the case in the Third Reich, which was was a regulated market economy with high taxes that fund comprehensive welfare programs. \n\nI hate marxism/communism/socialism just as much as any of you guys, but we don't need to lie in order to make a point. Socialism has been implemented in so many countries, and it has failed every single time. We have a huge list of examples: USSR, Vietnam, China, North Korea, Venezuela, Somalia(Somalia is a failed socialist state, not libertarian. Bring that up the next time a berniebro jokes about Somalia) the list goes on and on. ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"PSA: Don't claim that Nazi Germany was \"socialist\""}

Here's the cheese: \n      You are a Jehovah's Witness and your child is septic for whatever reason. The only thing that could save him is a blood transfusion. As many already know, to a practitioner of the Jehovah's Witness faith, blood transfusions are a sin and will damn you to Hell, so they won't approve it. Should the government force the parents to go ahead with the transfusion or not? \n     My thoughts on this issue are as follows, a parent doesn't own a child. That child is a person, albeit one that is dependent on a guardian. Ergo, a child can't be owned. If a parent fails to guard the child from dangers, especially if they are easily solved, then they shouldn't be the guardian. I explain it to myself like this: \n      If a religion preached the starvation of children because they believed children eating was a sin, would we allow the parents to starve the children? Why is it okay to some to kill a child by refusing needed medical services, and not okay to starve a child because of religious reasons? \n    What are everyone's two cents?

This led to the beginning of Ulzi, an app that keeps you and your loved ones safe by combining community and artificial intelligence.\n\nOne of the highlights of the app is \u201ccrowd sourced safety.\u201d It relies on your community members around you to help to protect you in case you\u2019re in danger.

The average police response time is as high as eighteen minutes in some places, but having an app like this removes the dependence on them and allows your community members to protect you, and vice versa.\n\nAnd now, the day is here!\n\nWe\u2019ve launched our crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, which means this is your chance to make sure you\u2019re not just in on the action when the app launches \u2013 you\u2019ll get a great deal, too.\n\nUlzi starts with U, but it also can\u2019t start without you.

A reminder to the reader, this is a series I called TERRITORIAL DISPUTES. I introduced basic conceptual elements and thereafter, I apply a theoretical frame (based on Rawlsian methodology) to solve well-known sovereignty disputes or conflicts. I explore what reasonable people would do in a territorial dispute. This is a theoretical experiment that deals with IDEAL theory only. There is no claim to NON IDEAL theory hence issues like lack of compliance are not explored.\n\nIn order to do it, I assume the representatives of each claiming party (sovereign States and a non-sovereign character) choose a rule based on theory game. I go for the maximin. From there, these ideal people come up with a solution to the conflict.\n\nLast week I introduced a new case for our  TERRITORIAL DISPUTES series: Gibraltar. The first four posts have to do with background information related to the dispute itself in order to set the stage for hypothetical negotiations. The fifth post introduces my solution which I call EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY. This week I'll complete five new posts. \n\nQuestions for the readers:\n1. Any disagreement with the facts?\n2. Any information or opinion you may want to share?\n3.

But, one of the things that bugs me about it is the environment.  If one of the core ideas of libertarianism is of limited government, the laws that regulate the environment would be watered down if not erased. Would large companies not take advantage of this and go balls out, completely destroy the environment and focus only on making the most money possible with nothing to restrain them? Even on smaller things like the conservation of animals through hunting. Would it just be open season 365 days a year? I'm not trying to come across as difficult and am truly trying to learn more about the ideology.

In the last two years I have experienced a PROFOUND change in attitudes toward transgender people, for the worst. This is something Professor Peterson has received many letters about from other transgender people, so I would like to share my experience on this sub.  \nAhem  \nIt used to be the case that I could go outside, quite obviously not lining up with any sexual category, or at least that of my birth, and be left alone. Sure, I would get curious looks, as if people were wondering \"Is that person a he or a she?\", but nothing hateful or malevolent. That was fine, and to be expected when going through a transition. Transitioning at first was intimidating, but also very liberating. My friends all continued to be my friends, and to them it didn't matter what I did with my body. That was my business, they just wanted me to be happy and certain with what I was doing, and most were not surprised.  \nThen, all this SJW stuff started popping up with increasing momentum. I was in my senior year of high school, and I first noticed it when a few teen girls started claiming to be 'gender fluid' or a 'demi-boy' (which sounds a lot like demi-god...at that time I was taking a latin class, we were studying the greek myth of narcissus, the origin or narcissists and daffodils. LOL. Sums that up.), they'd also demand to be called by pronouns like 'ze' or 'zir', and get their jimmies incredibly rustled if you got their pronoun (which changed daily) wrong.  \nCuriously though, none of these people seemed to have the crucial, medical requirement for being transgender (the thing that is actually treated):  \nGENDER DYSPHORIA; a mental disorder that causes extreme, debilitating discomfort toward the afflicted's sexual characteristics and/or biological sex role.  \nThese girls seemed perfectly happy showing off their cleavage or dressing in hyper sexual, feminine outfits. Showing the 'twins' off, from the point of a real transsexual (female to male), would be similar to a man showing off his freakishly large moobs. A source of shame, not pride. My male friends and I, all thought these people were some of the biggest phonies and posers we'd ever met.  \nI left high school and really payed the whole thing no mind. I thought it was a silly phase. But, alas, how wrong I was.  \nWithin the next year, I started to get people questioning me more often, asking me, or saying, things such as\n\"Are you one of those 'non-binaries'?\" \"How many genders are there?\" \"Are you an SJW?\" \"I identify as an attack helicopter\" \"Have you read any Karl Marx?\" (lol)  \nI'd usually reply with some sarcastic joke to make it clear I wasn't happy with the line of questioning, or at least didn't think it was funny. Gradually things got much worse, I'd get a lot of hateful glares and laughs, even threats, but I tried to brush it off. I remember being called 'It' by someone I used to respect a lot, probably one of my role models. I thought back to what had happened when I initially came out, the first person I told had sexually assaulted me because he was so unhappy with it. He said he wanted to 'fix' me. I told myself it'd all be fine when I finally went on hormones and looked like a man and got strong, in maybe, 2 - 5 years. But things were getting sketchy, and I wasn't prepared for any physical violence.  \nTurns out, after taking a blood test, I can't go on the hormones that would give me a male appearance and voice without risking serious ill health. Two years ago, I would have continued living as a man regardless, or wait it out in hopes i'd be able to in a few years, but now? No way. I was barely handling the hate, I kept myself going because I knew, it'd all go away when no one knew I was trans, or had been born female. When I was 'stealth', I could live the way I wanted to relatively unharassed.  \nSo thank you, SJWs. Thank you for making it not just stupid, but DANGEROUS for me to keep living openly as trans. Thanks for making society conflate a medical condition with being a genocidal ideologue communist. Thanks a lot, I hope you're safe in your college campuses. When Western civilization falls, you'll be the first thrown off the roof, just like those you claimed to be fighting for.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"A personal condemnation of the radical left and SJWs (by a trans person)"}

How do you feel about the scandal and data privacy more generally?\n\nEDIT: It seems like a lot of people don't know the details of the CA scandal, and thus why it is a \"scandal\". The general opinion expressed here is that people whose data were used do not have the right to be upset because they willfully gave their data to Facebook and CA. I think this is fair would be fair if this is all that happened, but this reaction doesn't seem to account for the whole story. \n\nIn reality, CA obtained the data in breach of Facebook terms (and I think this might be illegal). Basically, CA purchased the data from someone else who was not allowed to sell it to them. The person they purchased it from was a professor, and bought it as an academic, giving him a much lower rate than a commercial data purchase (which CA should have paid). \n\nAnother layer of this is whose data was obtained. Some of the data sold to CA was obtained from the use of an app. You may think \"well, people willfully used this app, so they can't be angry\". BUT using the data from the app, CA also got data from about 50,000,000 million people who DID NOT use the app or agree to have their data stolen. \n\nSo, CA obtained data outside of facebooks terms, and thus outside of what users agreed to. Moreover, data was obtained indirectly from people who did not agree to having it taken. ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How do you feel about the Cambridge Analytica scandal?"}

The answer is no.\n\n2) I'm assuming then that your argument is that every individual living in a specific geographical area agree implicitly to the social contract by merely being born in that specific geographical area. This is absolutely fucking ridiculous. A 15 year old did not agree to be born and he does not agree to be arrested for smoking a joint by merely existing.\n\nSo, I just demolished the premise that people agree to the agreement and therefor proved that the \"social contract\" is not in fact a contract, but I'm sure my argument did not convince you and therefor I will continue to the second condition of a contract:\n\n**After an agreement is made, individual parties do not get to change the terms of the agreement without approval of all parties involved.**\n\nThe \"social contract\" is not in fact a contract, because 1 party gets to dictate all the terms and change them on a whim. It's surreal that anyone can accept this as legitimate. Why would individual parties be allowed to change all terms and conditions at any time without consulting or even informing the other parties involved.\n\nAre you claiming that you actually agree to all the conditions of the \"social contract\", including all changes that were performed by the government last month? Do you even know in what manner the \"social contract\" was changed last month?\n\nNow, I probably still haven't convinced you that the \"social contract\" is nonsense, because you probably believe something like this:\n\n**Everyone implicitly agrees that only one party is allowed to dictate all the terms and change them whenever they feel like by being born in a specific geographical area.**\n\nThis is circular logic, I already demonstrated that it's not possible to agree to all the terms of this so-called contract.\n\nSo it seems like the rules and conditions of what makes a contract don't fucking matter at all and one party can just do whatever the fuck it wants and we all some how agreed to allow 1 party to do whatever the fuck it wants by simply being born.\n\nIn summary: The social contract is an ~~agreement~~ arrangement that agents of **the state** have determined, applies to all living persons in a specific geographical area. The actors that have determined that the social contract applies to all people, have also determined that they are allowed to change the terms of the arrangement whenever they feel like.

I am curious why that's the case. I know that they claim to always want to slash taxes and unhinder the economy but it seems like there track record as of late is... a little wonky.\n\nThe thing I like the best about libertarianism is it's social views. Specifically about the idea of a minority of one being a protected class. In my view, everyone has the freedom to do whatever they like in so much as it not hurting anyone else. More accurately, I don't really give a shit what others do as long as they aren't hurting anyone. I would also suggest that of the two major parties in the US, this seems to gel better with the Dems. \n\nNow consider the two parties fiscal views. The Dems and Repubs alike seem all to happy to screw over anyone other than the upper echeolon of society. This takes many forms but mainly the attitude seems to be \"fuck them I got mine\". I mean I get them advancing their own interests as it is human nature, but elected officials are meant to represent subsets of the population.  This behavior seems to occur, in my view on the national level, more often in Republican officials. \n\nI would also say that neither party cares about fiscal responsibility. The new tax cuts just moved the economic burden to the lower classes and yet with the new spending package it's obvious that they aren't cutting spending to offset the loss in tax revenue.\n\nSo my question is that give the system as it is, I don't understand why libertarian leaning candidates don't seem to emerge from the Dems? They could influence the party platform  to encourage a more fiscal conservative one while encouring social equality.\n\nAnyway, if you made it this far thanks for taking the time.

{"author":"Techius2","created_utc":1524332753,"num_comments":36,"score":12,"selftext":"What is Libertarianism? It's an ideology which someone is right wing fiscally, and socially on the left. Libertarianism is about being as free as possible.\n\nLibertarians are really shitty at marketing. It's impossible to take them seriously because they fail to separate their political beliefs from action which is based on principle. They politically believe in being as free as possible and not harming anyone. They then make this belief a part of their personality and actions, and it makes them an utter joke. This can be seen from Gary Johnson sticking his tongue out, to James Weeks stripping at the Libertarian convention. They don't harm me, sure. It still puts Libertarians in a bad image. Why would the average person want to vote for a clown? This belief that you have to be Libertarian at everything you do is flatout silly. If Libertarians presented themselves as people who seemed intellectual and respectable, they would gain popularity as they would seem like a more viable respectable option. You could throw in a few extra things like them playing the saxophone like Bill Clinton to try make them seem even more likeable. Being respected, being moderately fun has worked for everyone else. Libertarians haven't embraced any of this, and it's one of the things that's hurt them badly.\n\nLibertarians focus on issues that are irrelevant to the average person. Libertarians hate populism, but it would be an excellent tool for them to actually appeal to the working class. It worked for Trump in 2016, Obama in 2008 and FDR in the 30's. Populism is about making the concerns of the working class heard, and there's absolutely no reason why it can't be implemented into Libertarianism. If Libertarians were more tactical, they could embrace populism and integrate it using Libertarians. You could use populism to make the voices of the average person heard (the question), and then you could propose Libertarianism as the solution (the answer). This would be an extremely smart move for Libertarians and would make them liked among the working class. Libertarians still think populism is the second coming of Hitler. They think it's an extremely fascist tactic to use. The result is that you have Libertarians focusing on issues that nobody literally gives a fuck about? When was the last time the average person who lost their job cared about marijuana or selling heroine to a 5 year old? What you have now are Libertarians who are unpopulist (elitist) that focus on issues that are minuscule in the real world. The result off this is massive unpopularity. The fact that heroine being sold to a 5 year old is even being merely entertained shows how truly out of touch the Libertarians absolutely are.\n\nLibertarianism has lost the voices of reason. You either now have Classically Liberal vs legalise marijuana ancaps. Both proclaim themselves to be Libertarian. I would say that Classical Liberalism is the true form of Libertarianism. Fiscal conservatism and social liberalism. Nobody finds selling heroine to a 5 year old to be reasonable, except extremist ancaps. Nobody finds the privatisation of roads to be reasonable, except ancaps. Nobody finds the absolute gutting of environmental regulations to be reasonable. The only people that find these ideas feasible are lunatics who have never gone to the real world. They think everything is absolute, in black and white. Their own ideas are what making the Libertarians untenable. They don't understand that some sacrifices are going to be need to be made, but it's better to have those sacrifices than absolute freedom. Having government owned infrastructure (like roads) isn't the same as the holocaust. Having some (common sense) environment and workplace safety regulations isn't equivalent to Hitler gassing the Jews. Of course, reasonable Classical Liberals would understand this. Extremist ancaps would autistically screech about me even uttering those words and how they're the same as communism.\n\nBefore you go off about how third parties are rigged against, I would agree with that in a general sense. But it's not impossible for third parties to get ahead if they promote the right hours. In 1992, Ross Perot (an independent) got 20% of the vote. What did he do? He was a populist. He was respectable. He was reasonable. He was forced to dropout, but he clearly had an impact on that election. It's not impossible for Libertarians to get that percentage at the very least. But until they get their head out of their asses, they're going to continue to be losers and come to a realisation that they need to be adults, not petulant children, they will continue to only get meager results in election times and considered a \"wasted vote\".

Tomorrow, we find that an asteroid is headed to earth to wipe out human civilization.  It turns out the only way to blow up the asteroid is to launch a missle from the top of Mount Everest.   However, the top of Mount Everest has been homesteaded by a man named John Smith who hates humanity and thinks evolution has made a mistake.  He welcomes the asteroid wiping out humans.\n\nHow many of you would be willing to support John Smith's right to refuse usage of Mountain Everest for the purposes of saving human civilization?\n\nI would expect the consequentialist Libertarians to say temporarily confiscating John Smith's mountain top is okay for the purposes of launching the missile.  What percentage of self-described Libertarians fall into this category?  Deontological Libertarians would perhaps be frustrated with John's Smith's attitude, but hold his property rights sacred and let the asteroid wipe out humanity.\n\nTLDR - how many of the self proclaimed Libertarians are actually \"deontological Ancaps\" vs the rest?\n\nEDIT - tweaked a couple of things to make it a bit more clear","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Distinction between deontological vs consequentialist Libertarians"}

But I want to hear y\u2019all thoughts.\n\n\nEven when I was a dirty rotten socialist. Life has taught me that\u2019s quite a difficult thing to do. It\u2019s actually why I became a libertarian. I was working so hard on understanding \u201cthe right\u201d so that I could get their perspective and then argue with them why socialism was better, and I might even convince someone I was right because I could approach things from their own perspective.\n\nWell that shit turned me into a libertarian lol.\n\nSo now my goal is to convince people on the left. \n\nOne of the biggest things that turned me to the \u2018dark side\u2019 was something that spoke directly to my liberal thought process. Libertarians like Tom Woods, Peter Schiff, Thomas Sowell, and Larry elder taught me how social welfare destroyed the black community. How young black people and young white people were on equal footing. According to Thomas Sowell, young blacks were even doing slightly better than young whites. Then in Gomes the government with social welfare and suddenly boom, blacks are regressing in every way, poverty, violence, all that shit. We all know that as far as I know lol.\n\nWhen I was a lefty socialist I cared so deeply about the plight of minorities. I thought everyone was racist and that racism was an invisible hand in capitalism holding down black people.\n\nSo really the biggest key to changing me into a cold heartless child eating capitalist demon was showing me that in fact government regulation and interference is what did the overwhelming majority of the damage to the poor people I cared so much about. Further research simply showed me how wrong I was in so many areas.\n\nNot only that but I began my own entrepreneurial journey. I began thinking like a business man. I see business opportunities all of the time. Before I used to hate any kind of capitalist thought. I felt it was evil. But really I was just blind to the wonders of being an entrepreneur. Which showed me that the process of capitalism is not evil, and in fact is a really cool and amazing thing. \n\nSo in my mind the key to convincing lefties is targeting that deep care they have for the poor and minorities. Show them how government intervention hurts people. But how can you cast that entrepreneur perspective on them? I don\u2019t know.\n\nPlus I know that leftists are clouded, blinded. They have such deep hatred for capitalism that all of this is nearly impossible. Implying that minimum wage laws hurt people is telling a liberal that you ride around in a white hooded outfit burning crosses and terrorizing black folks. Y\u2019all knew that though I guess.\n\nI don\u2019t know what the point of this post was. This is just me venting my thoughts I guess.

Pirate ships in the 1650's through the 1750's for instance were democratic organizations of social outsiders, but they were free. Colonial rebels in America, in the revolutionary period were likewise free, but their freedom did not last, as evidenced by the whiskey rebellion during the presidency of George Washington. Freedom is fragile and the state nearly always seeks to suppress it.\n\nThe state exists to stifle freedom, minimize disruption, and promote stability. Maybe this is a good thing because stability is necessary for people to learn the system well enough to succeed in it. \n\nHuman's do not like innovation, or disruptive behavior. We are comfortable with consistency in our local environ. A wall street banker does not like to see an urban traveler on the street, nor does he want to see a person with tattoos, sagging pants and gang colors walking down his street. Likewise, a man in a suit with a briefcase would be a target walking down the street in most ghettos. These things are disruptions. Innovations which disrupted society include; Carnegie steel, which put all other steel manufacturers at the time out of business, Preston Tucker was run out of business by his competitors because he sold a superior product, and Ross Ulbricht is in prison for finding an effective way to avoid the modern surveillance state. Innovation is only encouraged if the benefits to society at large are immediate and immediately apparent, without degrading the control systems already in place.\n\nAs small children, we learn that this thing called society runs on certain rules. The rules we learn differ between cultures and social strata, but to succeed in a given clique, one must follow the rules that the people around you expect to be followed. These rules are generally \"unwritten\" and must be learned by experience. The point is, that conformity to the social rules is mandatory. \n\nHistorically, governments, states, tribes, and other social organizations have enforced segregation of the social classes and promoted conformity.\n\nFreedom, is really only possible in something close to a state of nature, where the population density is low enough that individual actions only minimally impact that individual's neighbors. Freedom, using my definition of the term, and society are mutually exclusive. ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Freedom and Society are mutually exclusive, Prove me wrong."}

There are three main parties: Gibraltar,  the United Kingdom and Spain. There are other characters too: the European Union and Brexit are playing their roles. The issues at stake are many; geopolitics, national, regional and international prestige, tax evasion, financial crime, sovereign rights not protected by the original treaty, and many others.\n\nThis blog series I called TERRITORIAL DISPUTES offers an open platform for discussion. As with the previous reviewed disputes, post 1 introduced very broadly the context and the parties. Posts 2, 3, and 4 presented the views in Gibraltar, the United Kingdom and Spain by including academic and non-academic sources with the intention to show there are different perceptions about this conflict amongst the three main parties and within each of them. Post 5 reminded the reader my proposal which I call EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY. Posts 6 to 9 applied the EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY to Gibraltar in what has to do with the financial system, government and law. Finally, post 10 offers an open conclusion. \n\nA reminder to the reader, this is a series I called TERRITORIAL DISPUTES. I introduced basic conceptual elements and thereafter, I apply a theoretical frame (based on Rawlsian methodology) to solve well-known sovereignty disputes or conflicts. I explore what reasonable people would do in a territorial dispute. This is a theoretical experiment that deals with IDEAL theory only. There is no claim to NON IDEAL theory hence issues like lack of compliance are not explored.\n\nIn order to do it, I assume the representatives of each claiming party (sovereign States and a non-sovereign character) choose a rule based on theory game. I go for the maximin. From there, these ideal people come up with a solution to the conflict.\n\nFrom tomorrow a new case study: the Israel-Palestine difference. \n\nREMINDER Note: I\u2019ll only post on r/Libertarian on Tuesday a summary of what I do weekly on the blog to avoid spamming this sub-reedit as that is not my intention. I only aim to open a healthy discussion.\n\nComments welcomed. Guest writers would be hugely appreciated. As you may see from the posts I don't take sides and I do this with utmost respect to all people involved. I'd appreciate the same respect in the discussion. I don't claim to have the solution. As I've just mention, I only aim to offer an open floor for discussion.

{"author":"rpl_fx","created_utc":1524585330,"num_comments":46,"score":1,"selftext":"One of the functions of marriage was to give women and children economic security. Throughout history, some men have obtained sex by saying, \"Don't worry, honey, I'll stay with you and provide for you and the kids\" and then not kept their word, because they wanted to go chase after other women. So, marriage formalized the relationship and imposed obligations on both husband and wife to keep certain promises to each other.\n\nEventually, the system was reformed to permit divorce. To protect women in the event their husbands were to behave badly in a way that resulted in divorce, women were given the right to sue for alimony, child support, marital property, etc. The difficulty in determining who was at fault for the divorce has led to no-fault divorce laws, which give the husband little protection from being ripped off by gold diggers and disloyal wives in general. A prenuptial agreement can be made, but that defeats a large part of the point of marriage, which was to provide financial security for the wife.\n\nIs it conceivable that we could scrap this entire system entirely, and just have a pay-as-you-go system, where men can walk away at any time from their families without having to pay for their support? I have heard libertarians say that mothers should have the right to stewardship over their small children in the event of a breakup between the parents. Along with rights, though, usually comes responsibility, such as the responsibility to provide for oneself and those over whom one has custody. That would mean women in that situation would be responsible for breadwinning, at the same time that they're trying to care for small children. Perhaps some women in that situation would be young and lack education or work experience. Jim's Blog [says](https://blog.jim.com/culture/the-feminine-imperative/):\n\n&gt;The system that the father and the mother get married at shotgun point, and the father is forced to support his wife and child, and the mother forced to honor and obey the husband makes moral sense. The system that a single mother is on her own would also make moral sense, if women could be treated as independent adults, equal to men, but when we tried that the result was far too many women giving birth to fatherless children in the rain in dark alleys. So now we have a system where pregnancy obligates men, but not women, where women make the decisions and men pay for the consequences.\n\nIs the possibility of women giving birth to fatherless children in the rain in dark alleys a real worry in a libertarian society, or would private charity take care of that adequately?\n\nThe other thing about traditional marriage was that it forced the couple to stay together; abandonment was illegal. So fatherless children simply would not exist, unless their father died or couldn't be located. By now, it's clear that in most cases, having a father around is helpful in ensuring the kids turn out okay. Are we just going to say that regardless of what promises the spouses have made to stay with each other and raise their kids together, they're going to be allowed to walk out of the relationship, because that's what liberty's all about?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Could a society exist without marriage?"}

You can just say, \"The market's got this, bro, don't worry; all we gotta do is get the state out of the way\" or you can actually use your 1-2 minutes of allotted time to go into a little more detail.\n\nProblem is, in my area, Virginia, we have some privatized highways (e.g. High Occupancy Toll lanes built through public-private partnerships, and even an entirely privately owned road, the Dulles Greenway), but the motorists don't really like these roads too much. Transaction cost-wise, it's a hassle to have to pay tolls rather than just pay a gas tax at the pump (some people even accidentally get in the HOT lane without a transponder and then have to pay a huge penalty). And the tolls are usually exorbitant. The Dulles Greenway has barely even turned a profit, but the tolls are still pretty high. I think the agreement they have with the state on tolls is a cost-plus deal, which maybe reduces incentives to cut costs, although on the other hand, the higher the toll is, the less people will want to drive on it.\n\nSo I guess from the standpoint of the motorist who doesn't really care about the ethics of taxation but just wants a good transportation solution, the question becomes, in our modern age, is it really true that private highways give the consumer better value than a public highway? The quality seems to be better in some cases (e.g. the Dulles Greenway is a nice road), but people don't like the cost.\n\nMaybe part of the problem is that these private highways exist side-by-side with public roads, rather than being integrated into a more comprehensive system. Maybe also, part of the problem is that the areas to be served by the private highways weren't really integrated into a land-use plan that the highway builders had any control over. Maybe suburban sprawl doesn't really lend itself well to efficient transportation solutions.\n\nIn other states too where private highways have been built, I've heard people complain that it seems to be a rent seeking scheme where the owners get a favorable deal with the government to monopolize transportation.\n\nIs the situation now different than that faced by the turnpike companies in the 19th century? Why did those work so well, but the modern turnpikes don't seem to be working too well?\n\nWhen people raise these objections, how do we respond, other than by saying, \"You just gotta deregulate and privatize everything to the max and trust the market, bro\"?

I personally find something quite funny.\n\n\u201cLibertarians are merely people who are displeased with neoliberalism, and wish to find a way to regress our capitalist system back to feudalism, replacing the king Charles' of the world with the wealthy class. The libertarian party, in a lot of ways, believes liberty is solely tied to ones right to own property, which is why billionaires like the Koch brothers adore such an ideology. It's reactionary in the most bizarre fashion. \u201c\n\n\u201clibertarians are just reactionaries and fascists by a different name, typically. although it can also mean left wing anarchists, OR it can just be a label used for a liberal who wants \"less government\", but usually it's clear which definition is being used.\u201d\n\n\u201cLibertarians (as the US right wing uses it) are just a subfaction of liberals.  They believe in small government and big business to the extreme.  Liberals are people who hold the ideology of capitalism.  You can learn about them here: https://youtu.be/VlLgvSduugI  TL;DR they excuse capitalism, believe in personal responsibility, and want to use government power to effect social and economic progress.\u201d\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"What communism101 thinks of us"}

The political discussion here is amazing, because so many people have mixed opinions, and you can actually speak your mind, unlike on some other subs I know *cough* /r/The_Donald /r/LateStageCapitalism *cough*.  I also get to here the best of both worlds, Libertarianism is a very middle ground ideology in my opinion, still right-leaning, but more center than Republicanism or Conservatism. And it's nice, sometimes'll see an article that I agree with, and read the differing comments on that, or the reverse. People here also don't base their political opinions off of stereotypes of other political affiliations, never seen a Democrat get called a *sensitive weak snowflake SJW*, or a Republican a *cousin fucking, educated, fat, illiterate idiot*, which is greatly appreciated.

So thanks sub for not being shit, I really appreciate it, because finding a sub for quality discussion relating to politics is too hard to come by.\n\n\n\nOh also, I'm not even sure if this post is allowed, because it doesn't actually relate to politics, just an appreciation thing, but I'm still gonna post this.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I'd just like to say thank you to this sub, its' moderation, and its' users."}

They have gone so far as too place an armed guard at Alfie\u2019s bed and have refused to even give him food or oxygen.  \n\nThis poor child is starving to death in a British hospital because the government decided it can play God.  \n\nAlfie\u2019s father kept him alive last night by giving him mouth to mouth.

Now they are armed with nuclear-warheads and missiles capable of striking our Pacific allies, islands, and possibly U.S. mainland. In short, for a number of reasons, we had to respect NK sovereignty and now that they have nuclear weapons this is even more true. \n\nSyria attacks ... Syrians, and we bomb them overnight and go home. The Israelis bombed them in 2007 for *potentially* having a plutonium production reactor under construction. We've bombed them twice more recently for gassing their citizens. That's in addition to us supplying weapons and training to rebel forces within Syria. Syria being a non-nuclear state and not being cozied up to major \"adversarial\" powers like China or Russia, the U.S. government doesn't seem to be concerned with respecting Syrian sovereignty. We've bombed them twice and we're not even at war with them. In fact, the international community seems to be okay with bombing Syria since they pose so little risk of retaliation (this is based on my assumption that Russia really only values Syria as a naval port and a base in that region and would never enter a major conflict over Syria unless attacks are launched directly at Russian assets in Syria).\n\nThis could also be applied to other countries. Ukraine was briefly the owner of the world's 3rd largest nuclear weapon stockpile when the U.S.S.R. collapsed until it decided to return them to Russia. Would Russia have invaded Ukrainian territory if they were still sitting on a huge nuclear stockpile? \n\nGiven NK has now come to talk diplomacy and is seemingly very amenable to lasting peace with SK, I wonder if their plan all along was to ensure they had the capabilities to insure that the U.S./China/Russia respects NK sovereignty before attempting to push NK as a regional power. If you have a big stick, then people have to give your demands more weight. Now that NK has a big stick, SK having a big American-shaped stick is less of an obstacle when discussing long-term agreements and diplomatic boundaries.\n\nMakes you wonder if the major world powers were less willing to violate a smaller nation's sovereignty, then perhaps there would be far fewer nuclear armed countries and fewer \"dangerous\" countries seeking to get their own nuclear weapon program. It's like being the only guy in a standoff with a water gun when the other guys have shotguns.\n\nEDIT: Just to be absolutely clear, I'm not suggesting NK attacking America would be good. It would be horrifically bad and would end in so much death and sorrow. I'm suggesting that NK having nukes acts as a check in power and keeps NK from being invaded/attacked without diplomatic resolutions being fully explored, as happens in other places where sovereign countries do not have nuclear weapons.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Is it a *good* thing that North Korea has nuclear missiles that could potentially reach American mainland?"}

Here's another one.\n\nI want to address the statists that use IP as an argument. There seems to be a fallacy that the idea of \"Why would I write a book if anyone can copy it?\" is somehow an argument that you get to steal from me to pay for the enforcement of your property rights. Wrong. In a voluntary society, if someone steals your car, that doesn't mean I have to pay the police to investigate your loss. You pay for it. The same goes for every other infringement on your rights. You bear the cost of your own rights enforcement in a free society.\n\nSo, moral questions about IP itself aside, if you believe that the arrangement of words that make up your book is your property, you need to pay the enforcement agencies yourself. The reality is that enforcing intellectual property is prohibitively expensive for an individual, or even a 'guild,' and that is why it cannot work in a free society.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Nail in the Coffin for Intellectual Property"}
