{"author":"Clayton_bigsby_MAGA","created_utc":1530511363,"num_comments":9,"score":0,"selftext":"The racial makeup of prisons are discussed often to argue that there is systemic racism within our justice system by libcuck feminists, but they never bring up the gender makeup of prisons. Men make up 93% of the prison population, and make up half of America\u2019s population. There is a degree of men being more agressive by nature, but even with that taken into account the gap does not disappear, unlike with the mythical \u201cwage gap\u201d feminists bitch about. Another factor that explains this gap is the coddling of women in society. \n\nCulturally, you see women slapping men all the time in movies, but the movies portray the man as having deserved it. The only times you see men hitting women it is when the man is a violent criminal and thug. This reflects society\u2019s double standard where men are held to a higher standard than women are. You also see it when women cry, people will console her, but when men cry we are asked to \u201cman up\u201d. As a men\u2019s right\u2019s activist, I do not think that men\u2019s standards should be lowered, but I think women\u2019s should be raised to the same level as men\u2019s. Men who hit women should be prosecuted and jailed. Women who hit men should also be prosecuted and jailed, and should be given a sentence the same length as the man. When men cry or show emotion in public, they should be told to man up. As humans we should encourage managing our emotions internally while acting logically externally. When women cry and bitch when they don\u2019t get their way, they should be told to stop acting like a child and toughen the fuck up. \n\nThe biggest issue of all is that 80% of women choose 20% of men (Chads). These fucking sluts don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for them because women\u2019s brains work differently than men\u2019s, operating on emotion rather than logic. That is why they choose Chad, a dumb asshole that probably cheats on women, beats them, but women knowingly throw themselves at them because Chad is a tall ripped guy that plays sports. The logical thing to do for women would be to choose a man who is short, fat, and balding but has a high enough intellect to comprehend the subtle jokes of Richard and Mortimer, is loyal, and doesn\u2019t beat her over the tall ripped guy with a full head of hair who plays sports, is too stupid to understand highly intellectual things like politics, Richard and Mortimer, complex science, etc, and also cheats, beats her, does drugs, etc. however, women are not wired as logical creatures so they choose Chad. \n\nThis is also why women voted for Hillary over Trump, they would rather have someone who is the same gender as them in office than someone who is going to get shit done and take our country back. Therefore, as libertarians if we want to win elections we need to do the following things\n\n-eradicate modern feminism and vote against all pro women policies\n\n-keep voting for republicans that support traditional gender roles, women stay in the kitchen while men work and provide for the family. Keep funding these types of republicans until the husband votes for himself and his wife while the wife cooks, cleans, and takes care of the children, which would effectively repeal women\u2019s right to vote.\n\n-to qualify for a government position or to start your own company, you must be required to have a certain testosterone level (men\u2019s low end of average or higher). If you fail this test, you would be legally restricted from doing these things. This would significantly reduce the amount of women in government positions or CEO\u2019s, and would also purge the soyboy low testosterone men (most men with low testosterone are libcucks, there is a correlation between more masculine men being republican)\n\nI do agree that these policies may not be \u201clibertarian\u201d in the short term, but in the long term it would maximize the amount liberty in the country because it would give us libertarians\/alt righters a chance to win. We need to be practical not idealistic, which means putting winning before morals and being willing to do whatever it takes to win. If I had to kill 1 billion people to ensure that libertarians win, I would do it because getting libertarians in would increase the amount of Liberty in America so much that it would cover the cost of the NAP violation. A true believer in libertarianism realizes that the ends do justify the means, and if we don\u2019t compromise our values to win democrats will regain control and they will flood the country with packs of low IQ immigrants that vote democrat.\n \n\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why libertarians should be men\u2019s rights activists rather than feminists"}

{"author":"Dr_Jorge","created_utc":1530613472,"num_comments":1,"score":2,"selftext":"We started weeks ago with the analysis of another TERRITORIAL DISPUTE: Crimea. We introduced basic historical, sociological, financial, geographical elements and many other issues at stake domestically, regionally and internationally.\n\nThe main aim of this blog series is to offer a platform for open discussion. After introducing all these elements we explored a peaceful solution by means of Rawlsian methodology. In other words, we conducted a theoretical experiment by applying different principles (for example, game theory).\n\nCan we do anything for peace? A reminder to the reader, this is a series I called TERRITORIAL DISPUTES. I introduced basic conceptual elements and thereafter, I apply a theoretical frame (based on Rawlsian methodology) to solve well-known sovereignty disputes or conflicts. I explore what reasonable people would do in a territorial dispute. This is a theoretical experiment that deals with IDEAL theory only. There is no claim to NON IDEAL theory hence issues like lack of compliance are not explored.\n\nIn order to do it, I assume the representatives of each claiming party (sovereign States and a non-sovereign character) choose a rule based on theory game. I go for the maximin. From there, these ideal people come up with a solution to the conflict.\n\nI also assume for the purpose of this theoretical experiment we have two sovereign States Russia and Ukraine claiming sovereignty over Crimea, the third populated territory in our model. The three populations through their representatives agreed on sharing sovereignty over Crimea. They understand that they are dealing with many issues such as activities or goods, and these many issues imply both benefits and burdens. So, to ask all of them to contribute equally and receive an equal return is not the solution. Neither is it for the better off in any given activity to contribute more and the least advantaged in any other activity to receive a larger benefit. They may either lead to domination or to continuous assistance. And because they do also know that they will maintain the agreement under the three pre-requisites, they keep their reciprocal non-interference and consider themselves reciprocally equals. In addition to this, they know it is a targeted agreement only referring to the third territory: this is not an agreement based on humanitarian reasons, domestic or global justice.\n\nLast week I introduced a new case for our  TERRITORIAL DISPUTES series: Crimea. The first four posts have to do with background information related to the dispute itself in order to set the stage for hypothetical negotiations. The fifth post introduces my solution which I call EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY. The rest of the posts examines who may have the right to claim sovereignty (what I call \"colourable claim\"), the grounds to claim sovereignty, and the theoretical experiment applied to territorial, population, government and law. \n\nQuestions for the readers:\n1. Any disagreement with the facts?\n2. Any information or opinion you may want to share?\n3. How can we solve this territorial dispute?\n\nREMINDER Note: I\u2019ll only post on r\/Libertarian on Tuesday a summary of what I do weekly on the blog to avoid spamming this sub-reedit as that is not my intention. I only aim to open a healthy discussion.\n\nI started this week with a new analysis on another TERRITORIAL DISPUTE: the case of Northern Ireland. Because of Brexit, I introduce first elements related to European Union law.\n\nComments welcomed. Guest writers would be hugely appreciated. As you may see from the posts I don't take sides and I do this with utmost respect to all people involved. I'd appreciate the same respect in the discussion. I don't claim to have the solution. As I've just mention, I only aim to offer an open floor for discussion.

Which is why the Constitution says that nothing but gold and silver coinage can be made a legal tender for the payment of debts. \n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Jefferson also described the evils of a central banking system: \n\n\n\n\n&gt; \"I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies.

Income taxes are just there to pay off the interest. The Fed controls everything. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis is why the founding fathers rebelled. It is up to us to alter or abolish our central banking system (which would make income taxation on a federal level obsolete) in order to preserve our freedom. \n\n\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve is not Capitalism. It is far-left Socialism. It is a device of pretend economies; it is a machine of debt with pumps primed with the oils of slavery, pressured with the air of theft, fumed with the exhausts of control, and its input is supplied by all of us who are forced to operate it and oversee its evil production. \n\n\n\n\n\nIt's time to abolish the Fed and bring back the gold standard.

{"author":"AerialArtist","created_utc":1530682533,"num_comments":49,"score":0,"selftext":"I am interested to hear your thoughts on why the following hypothetical society could never work:\n\n&gt;Every member of a given community is required to contribute a number of hours of work as a condition of membership (with certain possible exceptions like people in a coma, or with some medical disorder that leaves them literally unable to contribute to any task). Those who don't want to use that community's infrastructure and assets are of course free to go to a different society or to go live in the woods by themselves.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A database of all the jobs necessary to meet basic needs and maintain infrastructure for the community is made available online and by mobile app. People can rank these jobs in order of preference. Each day, they can award labourpoints to those they work with and receive services from, much like the upvoting system on this very forum.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Those with more labourpoints will be more likely to get their preferred task, while those with fewer labourpoints would have to settle for a task lower down on their list. The application of labourpoints would be weighted, so that labourpoints acquired in a given field would be worth twice as much with regard to that field, with a spectrum of less weight the further away from the field they were earned in.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Labourpoints for a given field would also be awarded for education received in that field. Education in medicine would for example grant you labourpoints that would be worth twice as much in the field of medicine. In addition to this, there would continue to be certifications, such that no amount of labourpoints would get you your dream job, if you had not received the necessary certification.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This would create a market-like incentive to perform your task well so that you can get more labourpoints and have a greater likelihood of getting the task you want. Anyone who developed a way to automate a task would be absolved from further labour, assuming that automation was adopted by the community and reduced the number of hours everyone had to work each day.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A similar database would be kept for jobs that were not essential to basic needs and necessary infrastructure, on a voluntary basis. Anyone could add their project to this database, and there would be material, non-capital rewards for contributors to share the fruits of the project. For example, those who helped make ice cream would be rewarded with ice cream. Those who helped build a sailing ship would get to go sailing on it with their fellow contributors or on some time share basis, as stipulated by the project creator at the time of creation. The allocation of community resources (milk and sugar for ice cream, wood and tools for shipbuilding, etc...) would be prioritized according to the number of labourpoints of all contributors to any given project.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Post-Capitalist Incentives"}

The GOP and the American right is shying away from social conservatism, they are realizing that weed isn't a big deal, letting gays get married won't destroy the country, that war isn't something to be taken lightly, and that maybe letting the government spy on us wasn't such a good idea. They aren't exactly libertarians, they would do well to educate themselves about the benefits of free trade, immigration, and lower military spending. However, we agree more than we disagree. \n\nMeanwhile, the left has embraced identity politics and the ridiculous notion of \"social justice\", and is becoming more authoritarian each passing day. Feminists demand that all American taxpayers(including pro-lifers) must subsidize abortions, and they call for lowering standards of evidence for rape trials, throwing presumption of innocence out of the window. SJWs call for restrictions on freedom of speech to avoid offending people, undermining your First Amendment rights. The NAACP doesn't care about racial equality, they only care about advancing the interests of blacks(color me shocked), which is why they are opposed to Trump's decision to end affirmative action. They want you to feel bad for being white, for being male, which is literally the antithesis of individualism. Not only are there social policies becoming wack, with the elections of comrades Bernie and Cortez they are embracing far-left economics, they don't believe you have the right to spend your money as you choose.\n\nMany of you here supported Obama back in 2008 after Paul lost the GOP primary, and that's understandable, the left was reasonable back then. However, times have changed, and the right course of action should be clear for 2020.

The people at \/r\/privacy and other tech communities were jizzing in their pants they thought that it will protect privacy in Europe. Well here is a fun fact, it didn't, in fact the law has nothing to do with privacy, yet everyone mindlessly supported it without even realizing what it is. It has nothing to do with privacy and it literally exempts the government from data processing requirements, so the spy grid will be just as it was before it. In fact I tell you a little secret, the GDPR actually increased surveillance even more, because now to comply with the \"Right to be forgotten\" element, all websites will need to store data about everyone, in order to make sure that they won't be subjected to data collection anymore. Kind of a paradox isn't it, furthermore it literally makes data collection much more organized, and forces businesses to hand over all copies of that data to the government. So it actually made surveillance easier. So what the fuck were the privacy advocates thinking?\n\n**Bonus:** It literally made thousands of small businesses shut down already, and tens of thousands more to come, amongst more known ones here: https:\/\/gdprcasualties.com\n\nSo the EU is lately in the business of fucking up the Internet, in such lousy, backstabbing ways.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-----------------------------\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow the Article 13 of the new copyright law concerning Europe will be voted, it was already approved by the legal committe, today it will be voted upon in the parliament.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**What will Article 13 do:**\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* Ban HTTP\/HTTPS effectively. Effectively all links will be banned, as you would have to purchase a license from the website owner to link to his material, so free linking will be over, effectively ending the HTTP\/HTTPS protocol entirely. I am not joking it's really this serious.\n\n* Businesses will be liable for the copyright infringement of their customers. Logically all businesses will stop free speech on their platforms to avoid liability, or shut down in Europe entirely, so say goodbye to: Reddit, Facebook, Youtube,etc... \n\n* Literally shut down all independent blogs. As if complying with the GDPR wasn't hard enough, now there can be no links on your own website anymore.\n\n* Outlaw image searches: I am not joking, due to the way the law is formulated, they will ban searches for images. So as providing links to images will also be illegal.\n\n* Effectively ending the Web in Europe as we know it, no more memes, no more pictures, no more videos, nothing. We might as well just get back to 1995 text based websites. No more hyperlinks, no more HTTP system, all of it banned.\n\n\n\n\nThe worst is that these slimy bureau rat bastards have just timed this monstruosity to coincide with the FIFA Soccer World Cup 2018 events, so they know most european males are addicted to soccer and they will be totally ignorant about this. Slimy little bastards, trying to pass a totalitarian law while nobody is watching.\n\n\nText of the legislation was just leaked a few days ago, these cunts kept it secret for this long, so only a few days before it's being voted on people can see what it's all about.\n\nTurns out it's worse than imagined, read more here:\n\n* https:\/\/www.techdirt.com\/articles\/20180703\/01343440162\/latest-text-eu-copyright-directive-shows-even-worse-than-expected-must-be-stopped.shtml\n\n\n","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"EU could ban the Internet Today""num_comments":1,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"EU could ban the Internet Today"}

It is often asserted that the world has made a great deal of progress since 1776, that we have had new thoughts and new experiences which have given us a great advance over the people of that day, and that we may therefore very well discard their conclusions for something more modern. But that reasoning can not be applied to this great charter. If all men are created equal, that is final. If they are endowed with inalienable rights, that is final. If governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed, that is final. No advance, no progress can be made beyond these propositions. If anyone wishes to deny their truth or their soundness, the only direction in which he can proceed historically is not forward, but backward toward the time when there was no equality, no rights of the individual, no rule of the people.

New to this reddit thingy ma jig thing, I'm posting this for david Andrew gay a nice, down to earth guy I just wanna spread the word of his group so he can get more donations\/influence\/spread liberty, he has a Facebook page called liberty memes. Check it out pretty please with a cherry on top...\n\nDavid Andrew gay's post about liberty memes community group:\n\nReposting because many of you didn't get to see this post when I posted it late last night. \n\nTime for a serious post. I know it's unexpected from someone like me, but there are some important things I'd like to tell you &amp; see discussed by the L.M.C.G. family.\n\nLiberty Memes has been going to major libertarian events this year and giving presentations. Among other important issues discussed in these presentations, we have made the following our key issues: \n\n1. Memes are more effective at changing the world and promoting liberty than D.C. think tanks, most of whom cannot grasp this concept and are stuck using antiquated methods. Yet, since they offer paying jobs, young people tend to get sucked into these think tanks, thinking that this is how they will change the world. Unfortunately, D.C. changes these kids and eventually they get jobs with other organizations that are more creatures of the swamp than anything that defends liberty. From this oft repeated sequence of events emerges the dreadful phrase \"I used to be libertarian, but then I grew up!\" We intend to discourage this course of action, and remind young people to stay true to their principles if they do choose such a path. \n\n2. The effectiveness of voluntary charity in promotion of liberty cannot be understated. Anyone who understands the guiding principles of libertarianism, understands that government involvement in charity always brings unintended (and sometimes intended) negative side effects. Libertarians have barely scratched the surface of this concept, but I believe it is a crucial tool for future activism. Listen, liberals are great at being charitable eith funds that have been stolen from other people, but they almost never open their wallets to help outside of the taxes they pay for government welfare. Libertarians are literally changing lives &amp; influencing thousands of people, just by being a benevolent factor to society. Liberty Memes fans have raised nearly $40,000 this year for various charities, and you've made it clear that you're libertarians when you've donated. I guarantee you that these people tell their friends, neighbors, coworkers, families, and churches that libertarians did these amazing things for them. Liberty activists are being seen as a positive influence in general society, and earning a special place in the hearts and minds of newcomers. \n\n3. We don't like Bill Weld and unlike Weld, we aren't \"here to vouch for Hillary.\" \n\n4. Humor &amp; mockery of the state is crucial to convincing society that the government is either evil, inept, or both. The more the state is mocked, the less people will turn to the state for solutions. They will instead consider liberty-based options; in fact, they will demand them. \n\n5. While there are many valid avenues for promoting liberty, If you're not having fun, you're probably doing it wrong. \n\nAgain, these are just a few of the key issues we touch on in our presentations. Others include rejection of the drug war, promotion of free speech, gun rights, anti-communism, and rejection of the notion that the U.S. government should serve as the world's police force. Loving your country is great, and the greatest forms of patriotism are most often found in protesting your own government. \n\nThis is what Liberty Memes is about. This is why we are asking for donations to our live appearances fund. Please like &amp; comment on this post to keep it in the newsfeeds, and please donate tonight: gofundme.com\/libertymemes or paypal.me\/libertymemes","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"LIBERTY MEMES *FACEBOOK PAGE* WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT &lt;3"}

The basic idea being that with paper money and, eventual Fiat Currency, you can loan out the same dollar and tie the same dollar up in multiple instances of debt. This multiplication effects aloes for a static amount of available money to be used several times, effectively increasing the money supply without the correlating increase in inflation that would be seen with either dumping a bunch of gold into your country (Pre US dropping the gold standard) or  by printing a large sum of money (post US dropping the gold standard). This Money Multiplier effect would then allow for an expansion of commerce without expanding the real money supply and allow for a greater ceiling of economic activity and thereby avoiding things like the pre Opium war's British Tea Crisis.\n\nNow, I really, really want to know how actively encouraging people to not invest into the FRB system will ever, ever be good for the economy when people bailing of the  FRBs is one of the major triggers for both the Great Depression and the 2008 Crisis.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Give Everyone Federal Accounts!

Example of where this idea loses me: we are presented with a scenario in which a person makes a bad decision and is punished by the market by said bad decision. In a libertarian world this is just the market rightfully punishing bad decisions, but let's play this scenario out; this person is irrational and does not learn from their mistake and continues to make bad mistakes that they don't learn from, we see this play out often in generational poverty imo. How does libertarianism fix this without social Darwinism essebtially? Imo this might be a place the government could step in hopefully in the form of local government not federal at least. Thoughts?\n\nAnother idea that I may also misunderstand is the idea that all people want is money to buy things. Obviously that's true but libertarianism\/capitalism seems to say that this is the only motivating factor. I don't see that as the case, in my opinion people only want dopamine. That doesn't always come with buying things. It could come from something like giving or charitable actions. How does a completely libertarian society make sure that people who do charitable action that no one pays for but that benefits society receive compensation? \n\nI know this subreddit is 90% memes so if this is the wrong place direct me to the right one please :)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Discussion on some concepts"}

On one hand I feel very very sure the potential for life is worth saving the baby pretty much no matter what and terminating the fetus is wrong because the fetus is the victim as it will one day be a thing. (I don't really want to get into the situational aspects or abortion like rape incest or anything like that I feel like abortion is an is or isnt kinda thing). But on the other hand it is atleast one human body that is being forced to deal with the thing by the government if abortion is considered murder and outlawed (which is generally self inflicted but that's not the point). So I came here because I kinda wanted to know what other self described libertarians think about this. I'm generally a more socially and fiscally conservative.

Instead, communists under the age of five or six have a very self-centred view of the world and tend to act according to a line of thinking such as \u201cwhat I want, I get\u201d. This means that if they want another communist\u2019s toy, for example, they\u2019ll just reach out and take it. Since communists this young do not understand that what they are doing is wrong, it is up to parents and other adults to teach them about private property, ownership, borrowing and stealing. However, when communists are older than age six they should know that stealing is wrong. When communists of this age steal something, parents must strive to understand why the communist steals and discipline the communist accordingly in order to remind him or her that this behaviour is inappropriate.\n\n-\n\n&gt; Young communists steal items simply because they want them and they do not know any better. This may be as simple as a communist taking a stuffed animal from a friend\u2019s house or pulling a new toy off of a store shelf simply because it catches his or her eye. When such events occur, parents must remember that young communists do not know any better. They have no concept of private property or that items belong to certain individuals, so rather than punishing a communist parents should strive to educate him or her. Reminding communists that items belong to people by saying \u201cJimmy has such a nice teddy! Let\u2019s ask Jimmy if we can play with his teddy\u201d will help them begin to understand the concepts of ownership and borrowing. When communists do take items that do not belong to them, parents should address this issue such as by saying \u201cThis is Jimmy\u2019s teddy and he will be missing him. It was not right for you to take him without Jimmy\u2019s permission.\u201d Keeping these discussions short and simple will help ensure that communists understand the main concepts.\n\n-\n\n&gt; Older communists, those aged six and above, should understand that stealing is wrong but many do it anyway. There may be a variety of reasons that older communists steal, including that they have succumbed to peer pressure, that they have no money to buy what they want, that they have seen adults or others steal, that they have never been disciplined for stealing and\/or that they have an underlying mental or emotional problem that pushes this behaviour. When an older communist does steal, parents should speak to the communist to determine why (s)he did so. Addressing the cause of the behaviour will help it from happening again. However, parents should also discipline an older communist each and every time (s)he steals in order to reinforce that such behaviour is inappropriate and will not be tolerated.\n\n-\n\n&gt; How a parent disciplines a communist for stealing is a private matter, but any method employed should teach the communist that stealing is wrong. For example, having the communist return the stolen item and apologise for his or her theft will remind him or her that not only did (s)he take something, but that (s)he hurt someone else as well. Discuss these topics with your communist, and also institute a chore or task that (s)he must complete to truly make amends for the theft.

{"author":"Kanaric","created_utc":1530989994,"num_comments":1,"score":7,"selftext":"Putting aside the details of the ideology, the \"never been tried\" arguments, \"Venezuela was real socialism\" arguments and things like that. The biggest problem I have with socialism are the people who claim to be socialist. For example a democrat who claims to like socialism or claims to be a \"democratic socialist\". Any regular person who claims to like socialism but has no idea even what it is. \n\nThese people have what I think of no ideological or philosophical grounding to their ideology. They also view everything as \"yes but\". As in \"we need to reduce police brutality...... but\". That are like that with every issue either exactly or comparatively. They have no grounding ideology like the non aggression principal. Their basic principals are arbitrary. \n\nI started as a liberal during the Bush years, was on the Obama train, then his government made me disillusioned. Back during Bush's time I was outraged, and so were many people, that they were just labeling everything as unamerican and random people as terrorist. Being labled as a terrorist had implications that you had no civil rights as well. We wanted to reduce the usage of that and my liberal friends seemed to want to protect peoples rights. It was a lie. They only were like that because their team wasn't doing it. \n\nAn example of that is any time a white person does anything that is criminal or if they are simply protesting things they disagree with. On simple things like the BLM for example. You have these people all wanting to label them as a terrorist. It's kind of a very transparent act of revenge on behalf of muslims. **The discussion isn't to reduce the usage of terrorist, it's to INCREASE the number of people who can be called a terrorist.** You also have them using the term Nazi like this, for example us if we consider ourselves libertarians in their mind can be Nazis. That makes it perfectly acceptable then, if you are a terrorist or \"nazi\" for police brutality to be used. There is the \"yes but\" on police that I mentioned earlier. \n\nAfter Bush my opinions didn't change because Obama was in office. Obama showed me he wasn't interested in stopping the things I disliked about Bush but somehow to the average person that we are talking about here that was OK. You had some minor gripes but it was, again, a \"yes.....but situation\". You couldn't become anti Obama on the same issues you were anti-bush about because he was doing other \"good things\". You had to be pro-Obama and nice slap on the wrist critical of him, kind of like how Bill Maher behaved during that time. \n\nI find that every socialist I know doesn't have consistent views on anything. It is true for alt-right conservatives as well but I feel their motivations are entirely different and they are not lionized by society or really care to have themselves seen as being virtuous in the same manner. But that is also why I do not like socialists, they see themselves as better than those people. From my perspective I just see them not being liberals or not being socialist but being \"unconservative\" much like those alt-right peoples ideology are just being \"unliberal\". That is their ideological grounding, not an equivalent to a non aggression principal but being \"unconservative\", which is why I do not like them and don't trust them at all. \n\nI am posting a lot on reddit today because I had to leave not one but two groups. One on reddit and another on facebook. The facebook group was supposed to be a funny comedy group but in the course of a month change to be an angry vindictive internet liberal group posting liberal equivalent of memes you might see in the\\_donald. Very on the \"Yes.... but\" spectrum when it comes to civil rights of course. I hope you enjoyed my rant, it's time I get on with my day.

If for example the United States government decided to fully dissolve peacefully on all levels across the nation there would be a monumental shift in power. Previously the most powerful entity on the planet was the United States military, post dissolution the most powerful entity  within America would be Erik Prince and his private army. While private companies will spring up to offer defense and police services for towns none of these in the immediate wake of the dissolution would hold a candle to the current PMCs While Academi, Raytheon and the others would surely become the market leaders in this new society and remain profitable, they would become far more profitable and powerful of instead of selling to the free market they just used their dominance of force to create a new State and Annex the free society of dissolved America. Any organization that becomes the most powerful free market military organization will also be in the same situation where its more profitable to just become the new government than just sell to the market.\n\nNow you might say hold up, if the country democratically dissolved their own government than a majority of the population supports freedom and would forcefully reject any attempt at reinstatement of a new government and allowing force over them. You might point to Iraq or Vietnam and say well look at how well a large motivated insurgency did on defeating the greatest military on the planet surely in this new free society the same would happen. What I would say to that is that rules of engagement have been extremely limited requiring proper target identification and properly assessing that this person poses an immediate threat to you. Also mass group punishment that the Chinese currently does to the Uighur's isn't done now nor in Vietnam. The brutal crackdowns on insurgents that Saddam did, that Castro did, that the soviets did, has not been done by America. If a organized military force like say Academi were to throw out all concern for human lives and decency and fight a total war for control of this new society including  the indiscriminate bombing of communities that insurgents came from, I think without  a doubt this new society would fall under the control of Academi or any other PMC. I think that a post-government  society would go the way of Cuba following their revolution and how one of the various insurgent groups out terrorized the remaining ones to force their submission and the installment of a new government. Insurgencies have been successfully stopped in the past if people are willing to go to the lengths that it would take to stop them. Ultimately I don't believe that the free society would be capable of protecting it self against a well organized aggressor in the aftermath of dissolution.\n\nI love the idea of a free society but ultimately I believe removing the current government will only lead to a more brutal government being created in its place. With that in mind I believe the greatest amount of freedom that can be attained by a society is by having an extremely limited government while still maintaining the monopoly of force. I would like to hear your thoughts on how a society could prevent this from happening, I would like to believe a libertarian society is possible but I have lost my faith due to this .","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How does a libertarian society avoid being taken over and turned into a statist one"}

{"author":"badboi9898555","created_utc":1531064818,"num_comments":118,"score":47,"selftext":"tl;dr: Private prisons aren't competitive markets, so they don't work.\n\nI would like to begin by saying that I am a solid libertarian on most issues, and am genuinely looking for a libertarian justification for private prisons. I have not been able to find one, and am interested in new ideas.\n\nPrivatization is not an intrinsically good thing. Just because a company has profit incentive doesn't mean better quality services will inevitably arise. The reason why privatization is *usually* good is because it goes hand in hand with competitive markets. Competitive markets work because the customer has a vested interest in the quality and cost of the service provided, and will choose to spend their money with whatever business offers the highest quality service at the lowest cost. By this definition, the \"customer\" is whoever is deciding which service to use; aka, deciding where the money goes. The \"end user\" is whoever is actually using the product. For example, in the toy market parents are the customers while children are the end users.\n\nIn a private prison system, the customer is whichever bureaucrat decides which prison company to use and the end users are the prisoners. Unlike the toy market where the parent is interested in spending as little money as possible while keeping the quality great enough to engage their child, the bureaucrat doesn't know or care in any way about the convicts and is spending taxpayer dollars, not his own. Since the customer no longer has any vested interest in the quality or cost of service, the market is no longer competitive. This invariably leads to a single prison company monopolizing geographic regions.\n\nThe propose of the corrections system, in theory, is to punish people for their crimes, reform them, and reestablish them in society as better people. But private prisons get payed per inmate per day, which means to maximize profits they need to maximize the quantity and duration of prison stays. To this end, they run the prison in such a way to maximize the likelihood of violent incidents between inmates, other inmates, and guards. They also have no interest in reforming and rehabilitating ex-cons, since repeat offenders go back into the system for more profits.\n\nAll of this leaves me very conflicted. As a general rule, the government sucks at everything, and I see no real reason why why it wouldn't suck at prisons too, but at the same time I look at the shitshow that is our prison system and I try to think of reasons why the private approach we have is more effective, why market forces would lead to our corrections systems actually working to correct people, and I just can't. I can't think of any way that private prisons don't ultimately become state-sponsored monopolies.\n\nThe ideal goal for society is to minimize crime, thereby minimizing the total incarcerated; the goal of private prisons is to maximize the total incarcerated to maximize profits. Compare that to other industries, where the goal for society is to maximize quality products for consumers and the goal of private companies is to provide the highest quality products to those consumers in order to maximize profits. In the latter case, interests are aligned; in the former that are in opposition.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but this issue has been on my mind for a while.\n\n(Aside: I agree that if fewer things were illegal, people would commit fewer crimes (duh), but that doesn't resolve any of the above issues).","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Prisons shouldn't be privatized; change my mind."}

This presumably would allow us to ease into carrying capacity and not let the booming population be stymied suddenly (be it by natural or artificial means)\n\nThough that was an argument in and of itself, it\u2019s not the question I came to ask. I recently watched an interview (or meeting I guess?) with Ben and a transgender woman, among a few other commentators. Ben refused to use her pronouns when speaking to\/about her. The commentators let him know that wasn\u2019t cool pretty swiftly, but he did cite some relevant statistics and logic to support his supposed rudeness. And then the trans woman told him if he kept it up he would go home in an ambulance. (and she could probably do some damage to that boy LOL)\n\nBasically, I think compared to what trans people go through, it\u2019s not much to ask for him to use their preferred pronouns. Is it really harming or inconveniencing him that much? Anyway here is my situational question on when he would use particular pronouns:\n\nQUESTION\n\nMy friend is a transgender woman. She transitioned in her early teens and has gone through reconstructive surgery. She is by all accounts gorgeous. She also looks incredibly feminine. She has some trouble coming out to people as trans once they meet because no one would even consider she is transgender by looking at her.\n\n1) If upon meeting, this woman told Ben Shapiro she was transgender, would Ben refer to her or talk about her using masculine pronouns, despite (presumably) assuming her as female upon first glance.\n\nNOTE: ik we may have differing views\/differing values. I\u2019m not here to attack any of you. I\u2019m the son of two very conservative parents and I understand and sympathize with many conservative stances.\n\n I\u2019m simply intrigued by Shapiro and since I don\u2019t have the means to ask him my question I thought I would turn to you all and see what You think he would say or what you would say yourself.\n\nCheers!","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I want to ask Ben Shapiro a question\u2014how do you think he would respond?"}

What changed?\n\nWell, you have to look at why the US wanted those huddled masses in the first place, what the huddled masses cost the rest of the country, and what the country got out of them.\n\nFrom early in its history, the US kept acquiring new land, land so vast and unsettled (notwithstanding the natives who already lived there) that they sometimes had to send out long expeditions just to see what they had. Settling all that new land was hard and dangerous work, there weren't enough people to do it, and there was a continent-wide expanse to fill from sea to shining sea.\n\nImmigrants. Need immigrants. How to attract them? \u201cHey, you're at a dead end in your country. You're poor. You're tired, and there are millions of you all huddled up in a mass with no hope for improving yourself. Come over here, risk your life, and work hard, and you can breathe free!\u201d\n\nSo, the huddled masses came. Some stayed in the East Coast cities, and others moved out to the frontier where they starved, froze, died in childbirth, and were killed by natives who were getting sick of all these people moving in on their land. When they starved, nobody back East was sending them food stamps. When they froze, nobody was buying them section 8 housing. When they got sick, they either found money for a doctor, went to a church for charity, or suffered and died.\n\nIt was brutal, but that's how those times were. Immigrants could come here and breathe free, but only if they were hard working enough and lucky enough to keep breathing at all, because the people back East weren't paying for any \u201csocial safety nets\u201d to save them.\n\nNow we're much less brutal. Nobody, and I do mean nobody, has to starve in the US. The American citizens will buy them food. They'll give them free or reduced cost section 8 housing. Show up at a hospital with a life-threatening emergency and\/or in labor, and you get taken care of, no questions asked. There are programs for medical cards to get free health care for poor people. We have all kinds of social safety nets, and no frontier to fill.\n\nNow, people look at those huddled masses and say, \u201cHow much is this going to cost me? I'm happy to have them breathe free, but not if I have to pay for it.\u201d\n\nThat's it. That's the answer to your question. The US used to have totally open immigration because they desperately needed people to go settle those frontiers, and they didn't cost the rest of the US anything at all when they failed and died. Just go get another boatload of huddled masses, and feed them into the meat grinder, and the ones who survive will likely prosper and thank you for being the land of opportunity!\n\nIt seems that social safety nets and open borders aren't all that compatible. If you have friends from some of the more socialist European nations, ask them about their immigration policies. A Swedish friend of mine was telling me about his country's wonderful socialism and equality and social safety nets. I said, \u201cSounds great. How can I move there and get all this free stuff?\u201d He said you need a job in the country before you immigrate, that it has to be a job which they're already having trouble filling, and - this is the big one - you have to have a bunch of money on deposit in one of their banks so that if your plans don't work out you won't become a burden on their social safety nets.\n\nFigures, right?\n\nIt turns out, the more social safety nets a country has, the more restrictive its immigration policies become. Apparently, if you have really awesome \u201cfree stuff\u201d for all your citizens, all the huddled masses want to come to your country, until you have so many huddled masses that you can't afford to pay for all their free stuff. So, they put severe requirements on prospective immigrants.\n\nGo ahead, ask your friends from other countries about their immigration requirements. Ask some Canadians what it would take for you to lawfully immigrate into their country. Ask some Germans, some Swedes, some Brits. Ask some Chinese people and some Russians and some Mexicans. Ask anyone you want from any country you would even consider wanting to live in.\n\nYou will find that, even now, with all our modern social programs, and no frontier to fill, The US still has the most open, least restrictive, easiest immigration policies of any of them. That's probably just because, among the rest of the \u201cdeveloped world,\u201d we have fewer social safety nets than any of them, but if so, that just kind of helps prove the theory, doesn't it","subreddit":"AskThe_Donald","title":"The US had open borders until 1924.

{"author":"LostTheFound","created_utc":1531152797,"num_comments":20,"score":0,"selftext":"If you think carefully about it, there is little difference between freedom and power. For instance, someone who is powerless is not free. A lot of things can augment power imbalance. Talent, luck, money, social standing, etc.\n\nThe problem with laissez-faire capitalism is that imbalances in wealth are built off of imbalances in power. For instance, an employee doesn't have the ability to take a larger share of compensation for himself, but the employer does. If an employee makes a company 20 million dollars and still gets the same 100k a year salary, but then the CEO's net personal gain from the actions of the employee, the CEO's power is what prevents that deed from being fairly rewarded. It's not that the CEO necessarily worked harder for that money. At some point, someone will reach a point where things snowball and wealth grows exponentially. Hitting that point is as much about luck as it is diligence. Sometimes being ruthless is what makes you more money. So, hurting others. For instance, if you throw your coworker under the bus and you get a promotion and they don't even though they work harder, you're going to make more money for being a dirtbag.\n\nThat coworker isn't experiencing the joys of freedom. That coworker is feeling the burden of powerlessness associated being the victim of Machiavellianism. Hard workers tend to get rewarded with more hard work in organizations, and not necessarily promotions. People with money can win lawsuits that they don't have any right to win - taking away people's freedom and power simply because they can afford to hire the more clever lawyers and keep paying them. My father was the victim of this sort of thing at one point, so it hits close to home for me.\n\nAnd people can feel this weight of powerlessness that comes from inequality in wealth. Libertarians really ought to offer more solutions to this problem rather than just defensively bashing anyone who considers laissez-faire capitalism incomplete. Truly consider how people really make their money, consider the power imbalances created by it. Offer solutions, not defenses.\n\nA good final read: [https:\/\/hbr.org\/2015\/04\/becoming-powerful-makes-you-less-empathetic](https:\/\/hbr.org\/2015\/04\/becoming-powerful-makes-you-less-empathetic)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Right-Libertarianism Falls Short in Addressing the Nuances of Power"}

I thought my appendix may be bursting, I was in easily the worst pain of my life. My blood work revealed I was in the very early stages of pregnancy and it seemed to be an ectopic pregnancy, where the egg is fertilized in the fallopian tube. The cells were growing in the tube, which was what was causing the pain. These are unviable pregnancies, there is no chance the baby can survive. After I heard my options I said I wanted an injection that would terminate the pregnancy. I couldn't believe all the raised eyebrows. I was asked by multiple doctors if I was sure, if I wanted time to think about it, if I wanted to talk it over with my husband. My OB works at the hospital and came to see me, (she delivered my daughter 19 months ago). She said \" We both know your body is perfectly capable of producing beautiful, healthy babies\", so she thought we should wait. She also told me that if I got the injection and it didn't work, the baby would certainly have defects and I would have to have a surgical abortion under medical law. I was shocked.\n\n1. This is not a baby, it's a cluster of cells that cannot possibly grow into a baby located in a place in the body that IS NOT FOR GROWING BABIES.\n2. Ectopic pregnancy can lead to the fallopian tube rupturing which can be fatal. It is extremely dangerous.\n3. I felt like I was being stabbed to death, even morphine was not touching the pain. My blood pressure was sky high and I was doubled over.\n4. Am I a walking miracle? Am I going to be the first woman in history to have an ectopic pregnancy that leads to a healthy child? That's what we are putting our money on?\n\nI wanted to share this experience because it left me flabbergasted and more than a little angry. This was a case when abortion is medically necessary to save the life of the mother, IF you can even call it an abortion at all. Suddenly there was a hard choice to be made and guilt and shame that needed to be felt? Fuck. That. Noise.\n\nEDIT: Thank you guys for being so supportive and kind! I want to clear up a few questions. I was in the ER twice, the first time they told me I was pregnant, and I was presenting as ectopic (abdominal pain, severe vaginal bleeding), however they could not see the pregnancy in the fallopian tube or in the uterus. A doctor told me I should have an injection to terminate a possible ectopic pregnancy, I said that was what I wanted. A different doctor came to see me and told me since they could not see anything on the ultrasound I should go home and wait. They gave me pain meds and a strainer to check my urine in case I was possibly passing a kidney stone. I was told to come back if the pain worsened or I had any vomiting or fever.\n\nTwo days later I started vomiting uncontrollably and the pain was still there (even with the oxycodone) so I went back to the ER. A second ultrasound showed the pregnancy in the fallopian tube. Yet another doctor was horrified when I explained what happened on my first visit and laughed out loud when I mentioned the kidney stone theory, she said \"If it looks like an ectopic pregnancy and presents like an ectopic pregnancy, we should treat it like an ectopic pregnancy.\" She was concerned enough to call me at home the next day to see how I was doing and provided her personal cell if I had any questions or complications.\n\nMy takeaway from this is that when these things happen, you have to be your own biggest advocate. Listen to your body and trust yourself, don't be afraid to disagree with a doctor, and please don't let someone shame or convince you into not doing what is best for you.","subreddit":"TwoXChromosomes","title":"Ectopic pregnancy leads to abortion shaming...""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Ectopic pregnancy leads to abortion shaming..."}

I wouldn\u2019t self-identify as libertarian, but I feel like I\u2019m moving further toward it each day. It\u2019s not that I despise the concept of government in and of itself. But I\u2019m realizing that government, whether big or small, has a tendency to end up in the hands of people who are either sinister, incompetent, or both. A while back I saw a meme or something that made the same basic point and had pictures of the big dictators and fascists throughout history. \n\n\nAnd that got me thinking, if the worst people are going to control the government, isn\u2019t the safest option to make sure there\u2019s nothing for them to abuse once they\u2019re in a position of power? Trump may be insane, but if the government didn\u2019t have so much power and the force of the state, the worst we would have to deal with would be Twitter rants. Obama could want to drone all the people he wants, but if it weren\u2019t for the military industrial complex and the fact that we\u2019re in wars all over the world, he couldn\u2019t actually do anything. \n\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be afraid of the government if decent people were running it. But when has that ever been the case? I\u2019m nothing if not a realist. We may not be able to keep unqualified people from getting their hands on the government toolbox. But if that toolbox has nothing in it, then I have nothing to fear. \n\n\nI had the same thought after the outcry about Dominos Pizza paving the streets. At first I thought, that\u2019s the government\u2019s job. Before long we\u2019ll be in a real life Blade Runner movie where every surface is just corporate logos. But then I hit a pothole and I think, \u201cI just want the damn potholes filled, I don\u2019t really care who does it.\u201d Like, have you been to a Chick-fil-A lately?

Donald Trump is president, and he is fighting back against the coddling of feelings and PC narrative in this liberal society. Political correctness, specifically intersectionalst identitarianism is a tool of the white liberal to divide our great nation and target minority communities. The white liberal makes empty promises to improve access to education, reduce crime, and overall advocate for policies that seem like they would benefit ethnic minorities. The reality is that the white liberal gets voted in, doesn\u2019t deliver on his empty promises, and keeps getting re-elected because people hear politicans make promises to better their communities and they vote for them. The white liberals say after failing to deliver on their promises that it\u2019s all the republicans fault, their racist, etc. \n\nThe reality is that it is really the democrats that are the racists, which is why in the democrat primaries the superdelegates went towards the candidate with Klan and white nationalist ties (Hillary Clinton) over the candidate that marched with MLK and was arrested for protesting against racial injustice in the 1960\u2019s (Bernie Sanders). The reason why mostly minority communities like Detroit tend to be poor with high crime rates is because of the failure of democrats that keep getting elected. Democrats with their anti men, pro feminism agenda pass laws that disproportionately lead to the arrest, imprisonment, and loss of custody for men in these communities. An example of this is the 3 strike law passed by Clinton. These types of policies are directly responsible for the increased amount of black children who grow up without a father in the home. There is a strong correlation with a lack of a father figure and higher crime rates, lower graduation rates, increased teenage pregnancies, and increased likelihood of going into poverty. This means all of these issues that effect mostly poor and minority communities were brought on by democrats. Don\u2019t forget, democrats were the party of slavery and founded the KKK. They have changed their tactics, but their goal is the same- divide and conquer, oppress the working class proletariats in favor of the rich, white, liberal bourgeoise swines. \n\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Debunking the myth of \u201cdemocrats want racial equality, republicans are white supremacists\u201d"}

{"author":"PrestigiousProof","created_utc":1531406227,"num_comments":58,"score":0,"selftext":"At risk for what? Chicken pox? Ask your grandmother if she knew anyone who died from chicken pox or measles. Different diseases have different degrees of severity in different age groups. The misconception that \u201cif you don\u2019t vaccinate, you place others at risk\u201d is based on an assumption that vaccinated people do not get the disease they were vaccinated for. Did you know that a controlled study published in BMJ in school age children showed that of all the whooping cough that was diagnosed, over 86% of the children were fully vaccinated and up to date for the whooping cough vaccine? There are similar studies showing that mumps and measles breakouts often affect the vaccinated. People who are vaccinated can have their immune systems altered in a manner that leads to susceptibility to other infectious diseases, and can also leave them vulnerable to the disease they were vaccinated for due to a phenomenon called \u201coriginal antigenic sin\u201d.  What is \u201coriginal antigenic sin\u201d?  This is where an injected vaccine antigen programs the body to react in a manner that is incomplete, and different to the natural response to infection .  When the vaccinated contact that disease again, they are unable to mount an effective response to the pathogen because vital first steps are missing.  The whooping cough vaccine is an example of this.\nhttp:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/333\/7560\/174.full\n\nA very noteworthy study was published in 2013, looking at baboons, which are susceptible and manifest whooping cough like humans do. In the study by Warfel, baboons that were either vaccinated or not vaccinated were later exposed to pertussis bacteria, something that cannot be done experimentally in humans (due to ethical considerations), but which yields very important data.\nhttp:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2013\/11\/20\/1314688110.abstract\n\nAs expected, the baboons that had never been infected got the cough and remained colonized with bacteria for a maximum of 38 days. But unexpectedly, baboons that were previously vaccinated and immunized vaccine-style, became colonized upon later exposure for a longer time than the na\u00efve baboons; 42 days. However unvaccinated baboons that recovered naturally and were later exposed to the bacteria did not become colonized at all \u2013 zero days.\n\nRecuperated and vaccinated baboons were also exposed to pertussis bacteria and then placed in cages with naive baboons. Only the vaccinated baboons infected them. The naturally recovered baboons did not infect their naive cage mates.\n\nThe following video contains relevant information that every parent should know.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/NtgiKFp9NJk?list=PLgH2vCx5TOgXZrRRM-ObX7JXt_0Ie8OI0\nSo, who is providing better herd immunity in the face of whooping cough bacterial exposure? Vaccinated individuals who presume they are immune, yet remain asymptomatically colonized for 42 days spreading bacteria? Unvaccinated kids who get infected and remain colonized for 38 days? Or the naturally convalesced who are not able to be colonized and therefore do not spread bacteria at all upon re-exposure? Better still: natural convalescence makes for solid immunity which lasts decades longer than vaccination.\n\nMany vaccine enthusiasts like to invoke the term \u201cherd immunity\u201d to make the argument that the non-vaccinated pose a risk to the vaccinated. But the concept of herd immunity has no relevance to the vaccinated as it was coined in reference to natural immunity in populations and what level the least epidemics occurred. There is no evidence whatsoever that having an 85% or 95% childhood vaccination rate necessarily protects from outbreaks.\n[Source](http:\/\/drsuzanne.net\/dr-suzanne-humphries-vaccines-vaccination\/)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Discussion - \"You are putting other people at risk by not vaccinating.\""}

How much should technological advancements be distributed, or have access enabled, so that individuals can benefit from technology that can seriously lower the costs of business or living.\n\nI also saw a documentary on 3D printers, and how those can even be applied in the future to drastically decrease the cost of living for individuals.

I have, however, came to question drugs like PCP. I have also questioned where these drugs should be done, if at all.

The model of the economy in this meme made me cringe.\n\nThe truth is, no political side has the upper hand on economics. There are both liberal economists and conservative economists in the upper echelons. These are people who have forgotten more about economics than you will know. Many of them have math and physics degrees at the graduate level.\n\n[James Simons](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/James_Harris_Simons) runs a multibillion dollar hedge fund. He contributed to differential geometry, which is integral to string theory. He hires people based on their ability to mathematically model complex systems. He hires only the best of the best, and he doesn't hire people from typical economics-based backgrounds because they're not trained in solving extremely difficult, complex problems. And, it's worked very well for him.\n\nJames Simons is a Democrat. Like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, he is among the wealthy people who feel that presently the system is somewhat imbalanced. From [this article](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2017\/12\/18\/jim-simons-the-numbers-king):\n\n&gt;Simons himself contributed twenty-six million dollars in the 2016  election cycle\u2014to liberal causes. He told me that he has always been a  Democrat, because of the Party\u2019s commitment to the poor. He sees no  disconnect in paying the least possible in taxes while supporting a  party that would like him to pay more. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be one of the rich  folks, but I think government ought to do as much as it can to help  ordinary folks get on with their lives,\u201d he said. As adept as he is in  math, he said that he was mystified by the way rich Americans had mopped  up so much wealth in recent decades. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly why such a skewing has occurred,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not an economist, and I haven\u2019t  studied the question, but it doesn\u2019t feel right to me to have that kind  of balance\u2014or imbalance.\u201d After some reflection, he told me that he  would support a rise in the top tax bracket. I could almost hear him  running numbers in his head about his net worth. \u201cA rise from forty per cent to fifty per cent would not be a tragedy,\u201d he said. \u201cDepending on  how the government spends the money.\u201d\n\nTo me, this left-right divide is not an issue of economics, but of values. If there's something I've seen, it's that most individuals on either side of the discussion lack a sense of proportion. I.e. they don't do anything like look at the actual net government income, the net government expenditure, where that money goes. They don't look at facts: they just look at gross oversimplifications in the media. And, then because humans are somewhat intuition-based creatures, they assume that they understand economics because they understand some basic concepts, like supply and demand.\n\nThen because they feel that they understand it, they act superior. So, someone suggests raising the minimum wage and they assume prices will go up. But that assumes that the employer can't afford to pay more and is always operating on a narrow margin when in fact, this isn't really the case. Now, arguments for minimum wage aside: I am not arguing for raising or lowering the minimum wage. I'm just making an example of people grossly oversimplifying economics.\n\nFor instance, in this there is a supply-demand curve. Supply and demand curves are used to determine prices. The price is determined by the meeting point of the supplier's price and the consumer's demand. The slopes of these curves actually matter. If you assume that automatically paying someone more will result in proportionally higher prices, \\_then you simply don't know how to solve problems or catch yourself when making assumptions.\\_\n\nA higher minimum wage will result in a small increase in price, if any at all. *So, don't use that as an argument against minimum wage unless you're ready to demonstrate it mathematically using a supply and demand curve and then experimentally by taking statistics on a number of locations and finding a convincing P-value*. Your issue with minimum wage isn't economics: it's your value system. You don't believe in forcing someone's hand. So, make *that* your argument, not some bullshit about how you're superior at economics because the free market is supposedly supposed to fix everything, a completely unfounded statement.\n\n\/endrant\n\nI was initially attracted to Libertarianism because it offered something new outside of left and right leaning views, and I also am very socially Libertarian (legalize and regulate drugs, keep all kinds of firearms with good enough access). But, I'm kind of losing my taste with things like that meme getting 87&amp;#37; upvoted on here, proving to me that I have to reassess my interest in the LP because it's pretty lacking in nuance.\n\nIf there's anything I've learned, it's that learning to accept honest criticism makes you better. I would like to see the Libertarian party evolve and grow. I want the view of personal freedom to be bigger in mainstream society. But, the LP is going to have to improve itself and widen its platform if it wants any impact on society whatsoever.\n\nSo, focus on things that liberals and conservatives will agree on. For instance, eliminating laws that allow employers to make employees sign non-compete contracts, legally preventing them from being hired by competing firms. That's legal slavery FFS, tying someone's livelihood to a single company since so many people work in industries where their only other options are competitors due to specialization.\n\nAnd, right now inequality is extremely high, higher than it's been in the past. And, this has an effect on the economy. That doesn't mean that the solution is the liberal solution, but you certainly don't have to act like it's not a problem. And, you certainly don't have to be one of the idiots who thinks that because inequality is extreme that any other solution is socialism. FFS, it would be nice if we had the levels of inequality that we had in the 1950s. A good amount of inequality is great for society. Too much is terrible: people stop specializing their skillsets to what they're good at because they're just trying to scrape by. But the solution could be a fiscally conservative one. But, instead of listening to liberals' concern, you just bash them for \"wanting handouts\" when billionaires like James Simons are actually liberal and think that inequality is a problem.\n\nThis is more complex than \"conservative vs. liberal\" or \"laissez-faire vs. socialism.\" What about FIXING capitalism? What about focusing on regulations that fuck over the little guy? For instance, guys who are well endowed or poorly endowed can't buy condoms that fit in America. No problem in Europe. There is all SORTS of bullshit that should enrage you as a fiscal conservative but that you're just unaware of because you still believe all the bullshit you're fed on TV despite the fact that you may rail against the media so hard.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"If You Think You Understand Economics, You Don't Understand Economics"}

The education system has corrupted the globeheads with useless garbage and standardized testing. People go to class, memorize a bunch of dates, etc, and they really only learn to obey and conform to a standard that is presented by unqualified people. The reason why I was able to figure out that the earth is really flat is because of my extremely high intellect. I tested at the top .1 percentile when I was given a complete psychiatric evaluation for suspected schizophrenia, which was completely unsurprising. I got perfect grades without studying, and I always challenged authority and the government given narrative as young as 10 years old. I watched the show Richard and Mortimer, and with my genius level intellect I was able to decipher the subtle scientific humor and completely understood Richard\u2019s nihilistic philosophical worldview. To normal IQ simpletons, Richard and Mortimer was just a funny show with a sociopathic time traveling alcoholic and his grandson going on adventures. \n\n\nTo me, it was much more than that. Watching Richard and Mortimer and then trying to discuss how Richard\u2019s unusual psychiatric makeup (genius level intellect, sociopath, risk taking behaviors like alcohol abuse, gun fights, time traveling, etc) influenced his nihilistic worldview with people around me made me realize that I am operating on a higher plane of thought than normal IQ people. I was able to use my extremely high intellect to analyze the speech patterns, word repetition, eye movement, strength of arguments made, etc by my educators and then correctly deduce that they are intentionally holding back information, and pushing an agenda. I also deduced that those words the educators are using we\u2019re not their own, but they were saying what they were told to say. Therefore, I took everything those shitbrained educators said and ignored it, did my own independent research, and redpilled myself on how things really are. I analyzed all the points and counterpoints for flat vs globe earth, and according to my analysis there is approximately a 1 in 999,243,624 chance that we live on a globe. Therefore, I can say with upmost confidence that the earth is flat.\n\n\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"We do not live on a spinning globe- NASA is lying to us"}

I mean, [I guess we've gotten a start on that constituency...](https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/photos\/images\/original\/001\/051\/601\/579.png)\n\nAnyways, I'm passionate about the social libertarian issues like guns, drug legalization and the general voice of reducing government intervention in affairs. Likewise, despite not being a total Libertarian fiscally, I also believe in the diversity of ideas producing a better outcome. Likewise, I think a conversation between Libertarians and Democrats would produce a better economic outcome than Republicans and Libertarians, since Republicans have the tendency to shut down opposition with power plays instead of conversation, so the conversation gets fucked and grossly oversimplified. I actually consider myself a fiscal \"nothing\" at this point. No one knows enough, it's like asking my opinion on how gauge invariance relates to the Higgs Boson. I don't actually have that expertise, and neither does 99.99&amp;#37; of the voting public. So, I am actually gunning (pun fully intended) hard for Libertarians to have their proper place in American politics.\n\nAgreeing to disagree is important, but finding those key issues that will launch you further is important. Don't go to step Z, and don't think that step Z is the outcome you want. Go from step A to B, and sometimes you realize that step Z is actually step C, and the real step Z is something you've never considered. So, we should push for a small amount of power in society first.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How Libertarians Can Gain in Society"}

{"author":"libertyseer","created_utc":1531605941,"num_comments":3,"score":10,"selftext":"This post is in response to a column in the Huffington Post by Kayla Chadwick from 6\/26\/17. It was recently posted on r\/Libertarian one or two days ago.  I wrote this article to show what it would sound like if it was written from a libertarian perspective.  \n\nOur disagreement is not merely political, but a fundamental divide on what it means to live in a peaceful society\n\nLike many Americans, I\u2019m having politics fatigue. Or, to be more specific, arguing about politics fatigue.\n\nI haven\u2019t run out of salient points or evidence for my political perspective, but there is a particular stumbling block I keep running into when trying to reach out to both sides of the proverbial isle and have those \u201cdifficult conversations\u201d never suggested by reaction pieces on either side.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to explain to someone that they should be respectful of other people.\n\nPersonally I\u2019m happy to tip an extra dollar or two for my fast food burger if it means the person making it for me was courteous and did a good job to help them feed their own family. If you think tipping should be mandatory by law, regardless of quality or service then you are a fundamentally different person than I am.\n\nI\u2019m perfectly content to donate to educational charities and private schools which help underprivileged children get a better education than public schools, even though I\u2019m childless and intend to stay that way. If I had children, I would never force others to pay for their food, education or upbringing, although I may ask for volunteer help if I found myself in a financial bind. If being responsible for my own family choices seems unreasonable to you, we are never going to see eye to eye.\n\nIf I had to do little bit more research on the internet to make sure my doctor, hospital, or medical treatment was safe and effective, I would gladly do that to help end government restrictions on medical care, lowering healthcare cost for everyone. Claims of safety and governmental approval should not be a reasons for medical monopolies and skyrocketing healthcare costs. Poverty should not be a death sentence when alternative medical options are available. If you are OK with millions of people unable to afford basic healthcare due to government restrictions on doctors and medicine, there is a divide between our worldview that can never be bridged.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to convince someone to practice the basic human attributes of respect and peaceful interaction. I cannot have one more conversation with someone who is content to use force, threats of force or violence to steal others income in exchange for some perceived government charity which is less efficient than private assistance. (do you make anywhere slightly above the poverty line? Congrats, this charity is not for you).\n\nI cannot have political debates with these people. Our disagreement is not merely political, but a fundamental divide on what it means to live in a peaceful society, how to be a good person, and why any of that matters.\n\nThere are all kinds of practical, self serving reasons to allow people to negotiate freely for their wages (some people in a desperate financial situation may be willing to work for less), reduce their taxes so they can afford a decent private education (private schools perform better than public schools), and make sure every American can afford health care (government regulated but unaffordable health care helps nobody).\n\nBut if leaving your fellow citizens alone so they can afford to eat, get an education and go to the doctor isn\u2019t enough of a reason not steal or try to control them, I have nothing left to say to you.\n\nI cannot debate someone into respecting others personal choices or not taking from them by force when they think the ends justify the means. The fact that such lazy, self-righteous bullying is considered charitable is infuriating and terrifying.\n\nThe \u201cI want to use force to either help the less fortunate or require them to live the lifestyle I deem appropriate\u201d has been oozing from the left and right for decades. But this gleeful exuberance in pushing legislation that will use force and violence against their fellow citizens, immediately hurting everyone is chilling.\n\nIt has always been like this. I\u2019m middle age and I\u2019ve read about this type of behavior in despotic governments of the past. Maybe the emergence of social media has made this heinous tendency more visible; seeing hundreds of accounts spring to the defense of policies that will almost certainly make their lives less free is incredible to behold.\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s changed - or indeed if anything has - and I don\u2019t have easy answers. But I do know I will continue to espouse the virtues of freedom and respect for all people.

The vast majority of Individuals experiencing thought distortions\/irrational thought are going to resist hospitalization, thus increasing risk of suicide.  That said, would a Libertarian government still be allowed to protect an individual from themselves?  As it stands, I am obligated to enforce involuntary admission if a patient\/client is suicidal.

As a therapist, I support a patient\u2019s right to self-determination, but I also have a responsibility to implement safety precautions when a patient is at risk. In the midst of a crisis, the patient would be exhibiting acute symptoms of mental illness, potentially creating a barrier to rational thought.  The patient would then be hospitalized, stabilized, and then discharged. The vast majority of Individuals experiencing thought distortions\/irrational thought are going to resist hospitalization, thus increasing risk of suicide.  That said, would a Libertarian government still be allowed to protect an individual from themselves?  As it stands, I am obligated to enforce involuntary admission if a patient\/client is suicidal.

Asking for notice isn't a lot to ask.\n\nHere are the facts:\n\n- 4 people renting different levels of the house. The landlord does not live here. \n\n- we share the living room and kitchen on the first floor\n\n- when I moved in it was a girls only house and it was advertised like that. \n\n- it does not say girls only on the lease, but the landlord only ever rents to women\n\n- our lease specifies we can't have over night guests for more than 3 days a month. If we do, we are subject to a fee of $50 per day for each additional night the guest spends over\n\n- our lease says we can't move anyone else in with us\n\n- my roommate has her boyfriend over 2-3 days a week at least. Sometimes for a full week at a time\n\n- initially she agreed to text me when he was coming over but she has stopped that now. Sometimes I'll wake up and he'll be cooking breakfast making himself at home \n\n- if it was once in a while I wouldn't mind if she had the courtesy to give me notice \n\n- the lease specifies that we cannot copy the key to give to anyone and he has a copy of the key and comes and goes as he pleases\n\nThen we had a fight. I took her aside and politely told her that I didn't appreciate she was no longer being thoughtful and notifying me of his presence so I can put on my Hijab. I reminder her that this was a girls only house and asked her if she could respect my freedom of religion and not put me in a position where I have to run out of the room to get my Hijab. A simple text would be fine but she can also stay at his place more instead of having him over so often, especially on places that we share.\n\nAnd then she was rude and had so much attitude. She said \"good luck proving this is girls only. That's not the lease\". While that's true I have text messages with my landlord confirming that the house would only rented to girls which he sent when I was considering moving in.\n\nAnd then she was so disrespectful, laughed in my face, and said that I could just wear my \"scarf\" everywhere around the house if I was uncomfortable with it. Since then she has been soooo rude it's almost harassment. She'll come in and yell to the entire house \"ANN!!!! MAN ALERT! MAN ALERT! PUT YOUR SCARF ON!\" and laugh.\n\nDoesn't this interfere with my right to enjoy the place I rent? Aren't there limits to how often someone can have guests over?\n\nWhat are my options here?\n\n-------\n\nReddit is too male and too atheist and that biasing the responses.\n\nSURE. My religion might interfere with her right to have guests, but her right to have guests interferes with my practicing my religion.\n\nWhich one wins?\n\nI guess in Reddits eyes it's automatically the  religious person who loses (on the basis that you don't agree with my Faith?)\n\nBut think about it reasonably - why does she automatically win? The two rights conflict with each other and there is no reason one should win over the other.\n\n**So as a COMPROMISE shouldn't she at least have to notify me when he is coming? It still means she has the right to bring him over and I can practice my religion in my home consistently.**\n\nAlso yes she did make a copy of the key which is against the lease rules. I looked it up and landlords are within their rights to demand that on a lease. So she is breaking the rules as well.","subreddit":"askTO","title":"I'm Muslim and I don't want my roommate bringing over her boyfriend because it means I have to wear my Hijab even when I'm home.""num_comments":6,"score":9,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"This is interesting.."}

The net effect is actually going to make the cost of living higher for everyone, including people making minimum wage.\n\nVoting for higher taxes is actually stabbing everyone in the back.\n\nHow about an example?  Let's make the rich (anyone making 250k or more) pay more income tax.  Chances are good that they are already spending a lot of that income (on their home mortgage and property taxes and more), so they will want a raise.\n\n If they are running a business, which chances are good if they have that much income), the only way they can get a raise is by raising their prices.  Good news, everyone is going to do the same thing, because all their competitors are in the same boat.\n\nSo suddenly everyone's prices go up.\n\nGreat.  Your cost of living has just gone up.  If you're living on minimum wage, and complaining about it not being a living wage, blame the tax man.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Liberals don't understand that the cost of living is directly affected by taxes.

They are quite common and quickly detract from any political debate. I'm hoping that by identifying these and bringing them to attention we can see them less often.\n\nLaw Equals Action. This is extremely common on reddit and facebook in my experience but less so with Libertarians. It typically looks a lot like that horrible Cathy Newman interview with Jordan Peterson. There are 2 parts to this one: \n\nThe first is assuming that when someone says a particular action should be legalized that means they want everyone to do that thing. A common example is legalization of drugs. Whenever someone says that drugs should be legalized a response will be something like \"So you're saying you want everyone hooked on heroin?\".\n\nThe second is assuming that when someone says the government shouldn't be doing some action that means they don't want anyone to do that action. A common example with this one is getting rid of welfare\/medicaid\/etc. It never fails that someone will respond with \"So you're saying you want to see people dying on the street?\".\n\nOnly One Way. Another common mistake people make is assuming that anyone opposed to their method must have a different goal. We see this one in a wide variety of political topics. You see people say they don't want to Build The Wall^tm and they will get a response like \"But we need a way to stop illegal immigration!\". The person might agree with the goal of reducing illegal immigration but not think that building a wall is a good way to achieve said goal. With this in mind it's pretty easy to get clarification about the goal being discussed so you can get down to talking about best methods.\n\nSinister Disagreement. This seems to be the one that really causes the most of the heated arguments. This is the assumption that only your political ideals will lead to a better world and anyone who opposes them is doing so because they want to make the world a worse place for everyone. In my experience there are very few people that want to make things worse. The vast majority of people's political beliefs are held because they honestly believe that if those beliefs were shared by all and their goals were carried out then the world would be a greater place for everyone involved. Identifying this one in particular can really help reduce those multi-paragraph all caps shitstorm arguments with family and friends on facebook.\n\nAny thoughts or additional fallacies you guys notice a lot?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Common fallacies in political discussion"}

{"author":"IsaacNewtonsAndroid","created_utc":1531830397,"num_comments":5,"score":0,"selftext":"Every time someone posts a meme into r\/Libertarian there is always someone in the comments section who decries the fall of the sub and mentions that there's no longer any substantial political or philosophical discourse anymore. In any case, whether or not this is true it does leave open the possibility for an open discussion on the topic that will hopefully be more enlightening than the usual complaints. It seems to me that r\/Libertarian and Reddit as a whole can be likened to a market economy with up and down votes being the currency. In this way we can see r\/Libertarian as a free market economy where ideally only the best \"products\" or posts would receive the most upvotes. As many have pointed out however, this does not seem to be the case. The first problem is likely a matter of perception. You, as a critic of the subs meme economy, place little value on memes whereas many more do. As such the issue could simply be that you are misunderstanding the \"market value\" of the memes because you do not understand them. The second issue is that Reddit itself is not very condusive to long, drawn out intellectual discussions. In the modern age most people have a short attention span and so when browsing through Reddit the larger, more colorful meme posts catch the audiences eye where they otherwise likely wouldn't have even read the post. Particularly if it is a particularly large block of text. Some people will stop of course but this is a niche group and is not indicative of the majority. This is not to say that the majority is inherantly correct, but they do weird the most influence over the market. It is at this point that many people will direct others towards r\/Libertarianmemes but this is a futile effort. In business location plays a very large part and r\/Libertarian offers a significantly better location. Not only is it's subscriber base over ten times larger but memes on r\/Libertarian also have less competition than on a strictly meme channel. Rather than trying to fight back against the forces of the free market I would suggest that those who cannot stand memes on r\/Libertarian make a new sub that focuses purely on long-form content. Perhaps an r\/LibertarianDebate or r\/LibertarianPhilosophy? It is simply to hard to fight back against the meme economy in its current state. Memes have all the advantages. They are easy to produce in large quantity, appeal to a large domographic, adverise themselves substantially more, and  bring in a much larger \"revenue\" stream. There is simply no \"Financial\" incentive to post philosophical discussion when long posts receive upvotes in the double digits while a meme someone stumbled upon in the internet Garner's thousands. This naturally breeds copycats who post large numbers of memes to farm for karma. In order to prevent this it seems necessary to enforce stricter moderation over posts which will not happen in r\/Libertarian and in my opinion shouldn't. Once again, I'd advise a specialized platform of your own. In any case, discuss. What are your opinions on the meme economy? What are your grievances? Do you have any feasible ideas of how to \"fix\" it? Maybe I'm wrong, none of this makes any sense at all, and this post will get over 100 upvotes but I doubt it. We'll see what the free market decides...","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The Meme economy within r\/Libertarian"}

{"author":"MisterCharlton","created_utc":1531849005,"num_comments":6,"score":2,"selftext":"Now, I feel as if this topic has been done to death over the past year or two, but I figured that I\u2019d take a gander and weigh in on the whole thing: what does everyone make of the alleged \u201clibertarian to alt-right conduit\u201d that the media seems to have been briefly fixated on in the aftermath of that \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally down in Charlottesville last year (particularly in the aftermath of the Chris Cantrell and Stefan Molyneux controversies, in which they have since made ideological conversations to the movement)? Although with a heavy heart, I can\u2019t but help see a sort of trend in that regard, particularly among our ancap friends and paleoconservatives who also identify as libertarian. What do you guys make of it?\n\nNow, unlike the liberal media, which tends to brand even centrists like Jordan Peterson and Dave Rubin as \u201calt righters\u201d, I tend to use the term sparingly, to refer specially to white nationalists and neoconfederates, so don\u2019t get the impression that I use the term cavalierly (I wouldn\u2019t even consider Milo or Bannon as being alt right). Trust me, libertarians are the LAST group I would ever willingly assign the term to. But even so, I can\u2019t help but view the claim as having some degree of validity to it. Even Richard Spencer, before becoming a socialist, considered himself a paleo libertarian anarchocapitalist. And then there was recently a low profile ancap\/paleolibertarian\/neonazi\/incel\/pedo\/nrxer who ran as an independent in my state\u2019s recent primary last month. And then there\u2019s ALSO goat blood-drinking crazy person Augustus Sol Invictus, who was a SPEAKER at UtR, who, as far as I know, STILL identifies as libertarian. As a classical liberal, this is concerning to me, and seems to paint us in a bad light to the rest of the general public, many of whom probably share libertarian-leaning views.\n\nFrom what I understand, many were former Ron Paul supporters from 08\u2019 and 12\u2019, which is also concerning, because many other supporters of Dr. Paul were centrists and moderate paleocons (and even a couple of leftists). I understand there was controversy with the newsletters written under his name, but it was reported to have been Lee Rockwell, who too is a libertarian. While I\u2019d hardly consider Mr. Rockwell to be a member of the alt right, it is still relatively concerning, as well as the fact that the Mises Institute (which I try so hard to like) seems to have some fellows and literature that are sympathetic to the movement, even if loosely. Tom Woods, whom I have been told has done some really influential things in advancing the liberty movement, was a member of the Neoconfederates at one point, and Jeff Deist, head of the LvMI, has actively used some fascist terminology in his speeches. While I find the whole idea of there being an outright \u201cpipeline\u201d as being something that is rather ridiculous, it just strikes me as concerning that there seems to be some kind of connection, specifically among our paleolibertarian brethren.\n\nWhat I find to be most dangerous are the writings of Hans Herman Hoppe, who comes across as a fake ancap. While I like his ideas on freedom of association and rather like his ideas of convent communes, his ideas seem to be highly problematic (not to sound like an SJW) and I find that they hold back the liberty movement. He even made a speech a little while ago that urged us to forge an alliance with the alt right, which I find completely repulsive, even if I understand the place he is coming from from a philosophical standpoint. Additionally, this seems to be a position taken by Mr. Rothbard later in life as well, and I can\u2019t help but feel that, given his later writings, that, at least to a lesser degree, he would agree with Hoppe on the issue to a certain extent. I could get flak for opining such and making that suggestion, but I\u2019m just stating such based upon what I understand about him, so I could be vastly misinterpreting his words (I\u2019ve always been more of a Friedman guy myself, being a utilitarian and a proponent of neoclassical economics as opposed to Austrian...don\u2019t hate me). Either way, he did speak kindly of David Duke at one point, who also claims to be a paleolibertarian. Or at least did at one point.\n\nI feel a certain kinship with our anarchist friends, and - not to beat a dead horse on the head - it, again, concerns me that some of them have made that switch, or, at least, have began to lean towards, the alt right, many more supporting Donald Trump as well (who, in my personal opinion, is the most authoritarian potus we\u2019ve had in a century).\n\nEither way, those are my meaningless two Orens.

At first I was like yeah common law makes sense because you let people judge the law with juries, and then leave room for interpretation so that the judiciary will help block tyrannical legislation. I think this is a farce.\n\nI live in Europe so I am under civil law and I have just realized how much better it is. \n\nFirst of all I think the common law as it is is very flawed and subject to extreme subjective interpretation which will only lead to disaster in the long run. Civil law is much more precise and accurate and doesn't leave room for \"legalese mysticism\". I will look at the pros and cons of each here.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Issue with Common Law\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe main issue with common law is that it's not precise and it totally leaves room for subjective interpretation, and there are no real explicit rights there, because all of is just relative, it doesn't guarantee absolute rights. Also the jury system is totally biased, yeah it would be a good idea to be judged by a jury, in order to eliminate corrupt judges biases, however the jury is even more biased. I mean a court case can literally be determined whether a juror likes you or not, trials become like a fucking reality show, the most popular side wins. And that is even more exascerbated where in the US the juror can't be found guilty for not judging based on the evidence, so basically a jury trial is just a circus, it's not serious.\n\nSo yeah your precious constitution gives you all kinds of \"natural rights\" which then the courts will just interpret away over the course of 250 years with all kinds of precedents stacked on one another, and then you wake up in the modern US or UK with no freedom and a near police state.\n\nStep by step your rights got eroded, and it's almost like a natural outcome of every common law jurisdiction. If you look closely the most authoritarian (western) societies are all common law based.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Issue with Civil Law\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo be fair civil law isn't perfect either, but it's much better. It does have flaws but nowhere near as bad as common law and it's a superior system in my opinion.\n\nFirst of all in civil law rights are non-negotiable and all rights are tied to the constitution. That is why usually you have all these damn exceptions in free speech like for hate speech and so on. So it's more explicitly defined therefore you need to add exceptions so that the government can exercize it's authority. However the government has to be in that boundary, which is very strictly expected ,especially after the atrocities of WW2, the government must follow the rule of law. So at least you can expect your rights to be more protected.\n\nThe main flaw of civil law is that sometimes not all rights are enumerated. So if you have a shitty or an incomplete constitution then the legal system won't save you from tyranny. But this has been fixed since WW2, the EU constitution guarantees pretty much all your basic freedoms, so you can safely expect them to be recognized in the future.\n\nThere are no jury trials or they are very limited, which is good. I mean why would you want a bunch of strangers deciding your case who you don't know they follow the evidence properly and can't be held accountable if they don't? If you follow the evidence you don't need an arbitrator, the evidence itself is the proof of your guilt or innocence. You just need a threshold, and that threshold should be very high for the defendant's side.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Difference\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe difference is that while in common law you have the spirit of \"freedom\", and a junk relativistic justice system that will just redefine everything and define all your freedoms away, as we see. While in the civil law you have a clearly defined constitution, full of exceptions, but at least the constitution has to be followed verbatim, so you have a much better expectation for your rights. The downside of the civil law is that in the past the constitutions were incomplete or bad, but this has been solved after the atrocities of WW2, now many atrocities are strictly forbidden.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Outcome\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe outcome is that in the \"land of the free\" USA under common law, you have now concentration camps for children, secret courts, indefinite detention, slavery in prisons, death penalty, [gas chambers until 1999](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Gas_chamber#United_States), police brutality, militarized police, no-knock raids by militarized police, mass spying....\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhile in the EU (which very authoritarian economically, at least your rights are safe) concentration camps and genocide banned for good, death penalty abolished, prisons are getting reformed and sentences reduced, drugs getting legalized , children are protected, police is civil and low armed, legal procedures in case of house searches and warrants are respected, no militarized police. And you can always appeal to the ECHR in case you are mistreated, and they overwhelmingly rule in favor of the victims, so the legal systems works well. (though we also have the mass spying apparatus, but that is a global issue)\n\n\n","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"Common Law vs Civil Law""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Common Law vs Civil Law"}

We agree a lot on social issues, but when it comes to government and economics, we often clash. The one area that I'm rarely able to argue involves health care.\n\nI've seen a lot of libertarian ideas surrounding the subject, but I've often struggled to argue how those ideas can work for health care. In a free market, the incentives of supply, demand, and profit are the most influential. That works great for cars, computers, and most heavy industry. With health care, though, some of those incentives have issues.\n\nThe most common argument my relative puts forward is the idea that in a free market health care system, there's too much incentive to keep people sick and NOT cure disease. And it does make sense on some levels. If a health care company or pharmaceutical company could choose between a drug that cured a disease with one pill or made it so someone was required to take that pill for the rest of their life, basic economics says they'll favor the latter. In that system, there's no incentive to cure anything. There's only an incentive to treat it indefinitely.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this logic. Now, I don't deny for a second that our current health care system is pretty inefficient, if I'm being generous. But is there a libertarian way to craft a system with the right incentives? I look forward to some insightful responses.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The Free Market, Health Care, And Incentives"}

I believe that in terms of Rape and Murder, if there is infallible evidence that the person has committed the crime without a shadow of a doubt, I'd be for the death penalty. I see this as being an enforcer of the NAP. Of course, there have been cases where people have been killed under the penalty when they were innocent. This is horrifying, so I would have a provision on it. It'd need to be extremely obvious the crime was committed. That is, catching a person in the act on a security camera or having police and citizens see it out in the town square at once. In my position, if a person isn't killed under death penalty for violating the rights of others, the restitution can no longer be carried out by the afflicted party. Thus, to ensure that said aggression is punished, the State then has the right to kill the individual as a proxy for the victim. If there was even a .000001% chance of the evidence being falsifiable or untrue, then I'd support life in prison without parole instead. Finally, I wouldn't support a penalty this harsh for any other crime but rape or murder, and I wouldn't support the penalty in the case of self-defense. I apply the NAP in an \"eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth\" fashion. An act that violates the rights of others must be restituted, no matter what time it was committed in.

I also have heard that while this sub is for Libertarians this sub is populated by people from pretty much all over the political spectrum. Anyways without further delays here come the questions and I \u2018m sorry if any seem silly or simple.\n\n1) What does each party believe in general? I mean people call the republican conservative and democrats liberal but this is honestly vague and not very helpful. \n\n2)Piggy backing off of this where do libertarians stand on that scale? I\u2019ve briefly look over the sub but it seems to generally no clear consensus over this besides that the free market should decide most things.\n\n3) What happens if you don\u2019t like any of the candidates that are running for office. I\u2019m not going to say where I live but I will say that I live in the south. So elections are pretty much all one party depending on town and location. I mention this because all of the candidates running for office where I live either don\u2019t support my views or it easy to see that they are corrupt.\n\n4)Back to questions 1&amp;2 but I have to ask what do you believe the government should be able to do? \n\n5) I know that in order to vote you have to go to specified locations but besides this the voting process is pretty vague to me.\n\nPS: Sorry for the lack of formatting. While I have been on reddit for a while I have only commented and posted memes, I have no clue how to properly format things. Also sorry for any grammar errors as I am using the mobile app and it\u2019s not the best for catching those types of mistakes\n\nEdit: Unfortunately, I have to get up early tomorrow for work so I won\u2019t be able to respond to any one else tonight. However, if you have any questions for me I\u2019ll answer them tomorrow sometime around lunch.

I completely accept the argument for why the service of policing or security is better dealt with by the free market in theory. However one thing I cannot wrap my mind around is what compels ANYONE to comply? For example if I were a prominent and rich businessman and the local private police pulled me over because there was a report of robbery nearby what is to stop me from telling them to screw off and go about my business (especially if I had my own security)? If they were allowed to escalate force to ensure compliance, is not that a violation of the non-aggression principle? Lastly, doesn't the privatization of police forces assume that we can reasonably believe everyone will respect their authority? Maybe it's my statist conditioning but it seems as though without the fear of big brother and the joint efforts of centralized policing that private security falls short in the ways I've mentioned.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Policing in a Libertarian Society?"}

{"author":"JohnStargaryen","created_utc":1531935978,"num_comments":20,"score":20,"selftext":"Hi All,\n\nSo this is my first foray into this sub. I have a couple questions about libertarianism and it's tenability, just would love to be enlightened about it and can't really find satisfying answers to these queries on the internet.\n\nA little about myself first. I'm 31 and have been a democrat most of my life. I tend to be very liberal when it comes to views on social issues and more moderate fiscally. Lately though as i've gotten older I've started to feel abandoned by the Democratic party. More specifically, my wife and I have started looking for a house to buy, yet while we can afford to live in areas that are nice and would be convenient, the property taxes of these areas make buying a house there nearly untenable. This just seems wrong as it seems like my house that i'd be paying a fortune for would be defacto owned by the government and really still a rental to me. On top of that my wife and i are currently making more money than we ever have by a considerable amount, yet our increase in taxes has left us with not much more disposable income than when we got our first small one bedroom apartment fresh out of college. \n\nThe logical conclusion to this i hear from everyone is vote republican. Yet I personally believe the modern conservative movement is really more snake oil with the faux design of being for the people. In reality, the real benefactors of their tax cuts always seem to go into the pockets of special interests and corporations, not the every day hardworking American.\n\nSo that brings me to today. One of my friends suggested that my own feelings are mirrored pretty strongly by the libertarian community. I know a little just from poli sci classes and general research. But I have a couple questions and am also hoping maybe someone can send me some resources that make sense. But anyway here are my basic questions:\n\n1) I know the core to a lot of libertarian beliefs is a Sales Tax rather than income tax. My question is how would this work persay? And is there a way to ensure that this doesn't leave us in a debt crisis? \n\n2) Obviously libertarianism is grounded in small government. With that being the case, what are the solution(s) to stuff such as building infrastructure and keeping America technologically caught up with the rest of the world?\n\nAsking this in all seriousness. And any good books or resources that you could send would be appreciated. Thanks!","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Questions About Libertarianism"}

{"author":"PrideAndPolitics","created_utc":1531964877,"num_comments":10,"score":2,"selftext":"#How tolls would work \n\n\n\nFirst of all I would like to debunk the common misconception that a Pinkerton Private Goon will be standing in your driveway to toll you in bitcoin every time that you back out. Nobody would even think about living there. \n\n\nTolls would also not have booths. Booths are far too outdated and are only used by the government because the government kinda sucks at everything and their bureaucrat committees don't keep up with tech. **Tolls would be collected by an E-Z-FastTrack system with light sensors** that take a picture of a QR code on the back of your car which is encrypted (or your license plate). They would keep a secure database of encrypted private keys for various cryptocurrencies in which the driver can manage an account. Bills could be collected upon passage or monthly, depending on the market (all hail to the market, the almighty god). \n\n\n\n#City Streets\n\n\n\nCity streets would usually be crowdfunded by building tenants or landlords who pool their funds to build and maintain these streets with limited tolls, and they keep a constant watchman over every corner block by block to remove accidents in a matter of minutes. Roundabouts would be common as they are cheaper, easier to maintain, and they keep the traffic moving. \n\n\n\n\nHere's the thing: businesses would do everything in their power to make sure that their business location is accessible as possible. Expect the roads and parking lots to be in tip-top shape. \n\n\n\n\nThe constitution specifies that the federal government has the power to establish and maintain postal roads, and that's exactly what they did up until the Interstate Defense Highways Act. Roads were mainly used by postal services and for the military, and most roads were privatised. \n\n\n\nAnd I know what many people say in reaction to this, and it's usually: \"Yeah, but that was back then when they had half-planked roads and dirt and mud and horses and shit, it's much different now\". \n\n\n\n\nBut the answer to that would be that it would have to be even more efficient for roads to be maintained in easy shape because it isn't difficult to maintain signs, guardrails, and asphalt. We are just so used to the government doing it. \n\n\n\n\nIf I owned a business on Skid Row, and I didn't want to invest in alternative properties because I prefer my location (some reason), I would invest in the maintenance infrastructure around my property in order to make my business the most accessible. I want people to have the easiest time getting to my business and I want them to be safe not only around my property but around nearby properties. This immediately prompts businesses to capitalise on serving the public interest. That prompting would establish local roadway associations of businesses who use certain roads to pool their funds equally to hire contractors to build, maintain, and pave their roads. Expect there to be no potholes. Not only are businesses inclined to do this, they are happy doing it because they get to decide how their roads should be, because they're building and maintaining them. \n\n\n\n\n\nSo if my road were adjacent to another maintained road, I may send representatives to communicate with those businesses in order to set a uniform standard of signage and road safety, because any roads near my property would have to be used to access my property and other's property. This starts a chain reaction of nearby businesses and sets a similar precedent of road maintenance, which would most likely conform with traditional American roads to avoid confusion. \n\n\n\n\n\nThere are plenty of historical examples of private transport networks without government involvement that accurately and efficiently coordinated businesses together to promote accessibility, and they all competed with each other as well. A great example would be Times Square and the 42nd Street Businesses Association. \n\n\n#Suburban roads \n\n\nSuburban roads would usually be crowdfunded by local agencies who have a tow insurance hotline in the case of wrecks. Under these private roads would also be private sewers and drainage systems which would be coordinated by the banks who loan mortgages to that community or by the property developers themselves. \n\n\n\n#Exurban roads \n\n\n\nExurban roads are tricky. They are far enough away from suburban commuter villages to be profitable to regularly maintain and they are close enough to cities where tolls would be tedious. \n\n\n\nSo the answer would have to be **gas stations**. That's right. The gas stations would own the exurban roads. They won't charge tolls because they want to keep the roads as accessible as possible to increase your chances of using more gas (or electricity for electric cars), and thus stop at their station. Other businesses and farms along these roads would be a limited fee to use and maintain them, but most of the funding for them would come from the gas station itself. Gas companies would also team up with trucking companies to transport certain materials in exchange for free gas along the roads for select trucks. Also, the signage would still be uniform to avoid confusion and the gas station would assume the legal responsibilities associated with keeping the roads safe (i.e. you can sue if a turn is too sharp). \n\n\n\n#Highways network \n\n\n\n\nThese are the hardest to build and maintain, but they carry a lifeline to a network of economies. Expect dozens of companies to build them in cooperation with existing properties (I pay you to allow me to build a massive byway skybridge above your property) and charge moderate tolls with light sensors. \n\n\n\n\n#The government \n\n\n\nI'm not against the government building some roads, but they shouldn't use imminent domain and they shouldn't force me to pay for them unless it is a toll that pays for the road itself.

A Utilitarian like Friedman? A Virtue Ethicist like Ayn Rand? Or do you just prefer small government because small government is attractive?\n\nPersonally, I am a utilitarian (the Millean variety, not the Bentham kind). I believe that libertarianism is the most pragmatic form of government, and that the consequences of its existence will ultimately maximize not only the efficiency of the government, but also market innovations and how we handle foreign policy. Most importantly, I believe that the moral thing to do is the decision whose consequence yields the greatest amount of happiness in the greatest number of individuals (not the collective). Ultimately, a government that has the most civil liberties leads to a society where people have more freedom, and the more freedom people have, the happier they become (pretty sure it\u2019s psychologically proven that such is the case most of the time). I also include some deontological elements in my personal philosophy (though I lean more towards Kant\u2019s view than Rothbard\u2019s). For instance, I believe a society that guarantees both the absolutism and respect towards a person\u2019s natural rights also makes a person happier, so in a way I defend deontology on utilitarian grounds.\n\nEither way, what do you guys closely identify as, if anything.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Upon which philosophy do you justify your libertarianism?"}

Then the government said the park system couldn't have them working year-round without calling them full time and paying benefits... so the park system \"fired\" everyone instead. (I'm grossly oversimplifying. Read the article.)\n\nAt the end of all this, my friend said, \"The article attributes the changes in hiring procedures to the [National Park Service]. It was actually [the Office of Personnel Management] that took a firm position with the NPS and said \u2018you\u2019re exploiting seasonal employees by making them do full-time work without offering them benefits.\u2019 Which is exactly what was happening. The issue now is they didn\u2019t follow through with a fix. They just said \u2018you can\u2019t do that\u2019 and now Park Rangers are out of a job for six months of the year. Ideally, they should have said \u2018you can do that but you must also call them full time employees and offer benefits\u2019 or created more permanent positions. But the NPS doesn\u2019t have the budget to do either.\"\n\nI know this person has liberal\/progressive leanings and enthusiastically supported Jill Stein... but she also immediately recognized the issue that many libertarians would point out: \"The NPS doesn't have the budget\" to offer everyone benefits.\n\nIf we can focus on digging into specific examples like this, and really flesh out the challenges involved, I think there's common ground for seemingly opposite political factions to find a shared perspective.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"An example of more benefits leading to fewer jobs... from a Jill Stein supporter."}

Basically the authoritarian argument against drugs is that they want to completely collectivise society and guarantee the social safety of the citizens. Yet, when questioned on economics, they\u2019re relatively centrist or on the right. Well, if they want to guarantee people their social safety and prevent social degeneracy, they should want to guarantee their economic safety with a basic income, universal healthcare, and a welfare state the size of the ocean. But, no, they\u2019re usually national socialist and somehow that argument doesn\u2019t either convert them to be more libertarian on drugs or more left on economics.\n    The other fallacy of authoritarians logic is that they think there is going to be a decrease in drug use by banning it. Except, they\u2019re still pro gun rights? And the argument for gun rights is the same as it is for drugs. Criminals don\u2019t care what the law is. By banning something, all you do is effectively create a black market, and a harmful one at that. You actually have more anarchy and chaos by being authoritarian on drugs because the drug dealers aren\u2019t regulated, licensed, they sell designer drugs like Special K and bath salts which are the most harmful things you can think of combined, and they can sell to children. By legalizing drugs, you can regulate the market and prevent all of these things. So legalization is more authoritarian than banning drugs.\n    A huge example of the issues of designer drugs is Prince\u2019s death. Prince was using a form of heroin that was laced with a form of elephant tranquilizer, about 400x more powerful than morphine. To put that in perspective if you don\u2019t know, morphine is used for patients whose legs are falling off and things in that ballpark. Now Prince wouldn\u2019t have been doing that drug had there been a legal market where he could buy a legal, safe alternative similar to heroin. But, no.

{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1532194103,"num_comments":10,"score":3,"selftext":"I've been looking into monopolies and their different types lately. Most monopolies I definitely agree arise from government interference in the market. I don't see the Anti-Trust laws as being needed as they create more monopolies than they'll ever destroy. In fact, most monopolies would be destroyed by free-market competition. I also don't support zoning laws, as I believe demand should determine where people setup shop. However, there's one problem I cannot reconcile, and that is the problem of a land monopoly. Let's say an incredibly rich company buys out all of the land in an isolated area for the purpose of preventing any competition. They use the land they bought to prevent other businesses from setting up shop and then the business leaves all land areas except one unused. The one that's being used is for a factory to supply jobs and goods. However, they keep job amounts low. restricting employment severely. Considering this area might be small (or not attracting new businesses at the time), this allows one company to price set. The price of living goes up so much people aren't able to move out of the town to find new businesses, keeping them lock-and-key. How would we as Libertarians solve this scenario? I've looked up two solutions on this scenario: a Land Value Tax and Public Property. Public property would allow businesses to rent off of the government. However, considering it's not their property, pollution could become an issue. A Land Value Tax seems like a nice alternative to me, but it also kinda reminds me of a couple of socialist policies. If the person didn't pay up, they could be kicked off their land with their property still on it, effectively redistributing wealth. Assuming we have a government, how could we prevent a negative monopolization of land? I already know all monopolies aren't bad, but I'm only speaking of the negative monopolies on land.

I agree that the NAP is a very nice principle to abide by, especially in your personal life. However, whenever we argue something, I think we should at least try to argue it from a point of either logic or empirical evidence. Saying you support something based on the NAP alone, rather than by using logic to support something, is essentially following the principle blindly without thinking for yourself. Considering several people cite this for their arguments and nothing else, it leads me to believe some Libertarians are ideologues instead of independent self-thinkers like Libertarians should be.

{"author":"Gemingo","created_utc":1532209750,"num_comments":1,"score":2,"selftext":"Exploring libertarian thinking.\nLibertarian thought is based on reducing state power, thereby increasing the liberty and prosperity of individuals and free markets.\nAs with similar labels across the political spectrum, a libertarian is someone who has a subscript set of views as would a conservative or a liberal. Of course within all groups there are sub divisions over swing topics such as gay marriage, taxation, military action overseas.\nIt can be said that there are two types of libertarians; there are those in support of a large military and those opposed to a large military. The arguments for both positions are sound, the topic becomes so divisive because they fulfil different elements of what a libertarian society should be. A small military believer such as Larry Elder proposes that a government should enact no more power abroad as they do domestically. On the other side, a large military is necessary for greater global freedom. A look at Japan, Germany and South Korea demonstrates how strong (US) military action and long term military presents has stabilised regions once fraught with war.\nBoth cases fulfil different elements of the non-aggression-principal (NAP). That is the belief that freedom should only be limited when other\u2019s rights become threatened. It is a messages aimed at anyone who may threaten liberty, especially the government.\nFor many the idea of the NAP is one they can get behind but the NAP is as mush the idea itself as is what it excludes. Under the non-aggression-principal would drugs be legal, taxes and business regulation low. This is the principal at the core of the mind of libertarian thinkers and political parties, the only way each differs is from how they apply this idea to real life scenarios. Should speech be free and open to the extent of allowing pro-Nazi messages? The US libertarian party agrees. Should a woman be free to terminate their unwanted pregnancy? The UK libertarian party believes so. Others say that ending a life is a direct violation of the NAP and morally indefensible, that the government has functions to protect \u201clife, liberty, and property and one of those is life.\u201d\nWhat is universal is a want for lower taxes, minimal economic intervention freedom to live as seen fit; believing that these factors produce the best quality of life for individuals and grow economies.\n \n \nLibertarianism is often described as socially liberal, economically conservative; this is largely true but it is important to make a measurement on the alternate scale on the political compass. Lower on the authoritarian\/ libertarian scale is a night watchman state. A night watchman state only and purely protects its citizen\u2019s rights by providing police, courts, jails, and a military. In return a small portion of taxes are paid. This leaves no room for functions widely considered foundational, especially with regards to the economy \u2013 welfare, minimum wage guarantees, tariffs, subsidies economic union membership.  This is what\u2019s called Laissez-faire economics (French; \u2018let do\u2019) where there is zero intervention outside of property rights protection. To a large extent has been\/ is practised throughout the industrial world where China, India, South Korea, Poland, Spain have all seen enormous economic growth in the last forty years, and the UK in the 20th century. Under these conditions pollution, child labour, and poverty income rates are all too common. However it is these conditions that produce wealth and development to struggling nations and it is too much state interference that cripple economies, even those of great potential.\n \n \nWhat if the basic functions of a night watchman state were to be completely liquidated by private corporations? The functions carried out by such a state would be taken over by businesses and run as such. This is known as anarcho-capitalism, where (with a twist) the free market substitutes the state, completely.\nAnarcho-capitalism is based on the comparison of the reciprocal nature of government vs enterprise. For example: the taxes you pay, even to a small state, are not always proportionate to the service you receive and are never optional. Whereas in business what you pay is proportional what you receive out of it. If it is not you have the choice to spend elsewhere.  Anarcho-capitalism is as much an attack on state as it is a strong levy for capitalism.\nIt is imagined by Brian Caplan, professor of economics at George Mason University that in a system of anarcho-capitalism justice would be carried out by enterprise. They would be under the same market forces as shape private sector. The leap from our current system may not be as large as it seems - there are more private security members (bouncers, corporate security) than are police currently in the US.\nBrian caplan and other anarcho capitalists believe that once reliance on government is removed people will negotiate employee rights and other dealings themselves. Prevailing market forces and the elimination of taxes will produce innovation and progress like never before, stating that Uber and Lift has done more to prevent drunk driving than government policy ever has \u2013 why not extend enterprise to cover more serious government functions?\n \n ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Here\u2019s an article I wrote for sixth form (year 13) called Exploring libertarian thinking.

{"author":"Jos_Metadi","created_utc":1532289401,"num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"As far as I can tell, there are 4 types of monopolies:\n\n1. a monopoly due to new tech or intellectual property that other's can't legally use yet\n2. a monopoly by government regulations that bar competitors from entering the market\n3. a monopoly caused by a company buying up its potential rivals so that it controls the market\n4. a monopoly caused by a company doing such a good job at a low price that no one else can compete\n\nI've been kicking around an idea that is aimed at reducing the prevalence of the third type of monopoly while also making the government be less involved in the process.\n\nThe gist of my idea is that corporations should not be allowed to buy\/own the stock of any other company besides itself. Individuals could own shares in both companies, and the ownership could even be completely overlapped, with the exact same people owning all the shares of corporation A and corporation B. But Corporation A couldn't own Corporation B, and vice versa.\n\nThe reasons for the idea are:\n\n* It would be harder for a company to turn into a monolopy since it wouldn't be buying competitors directly. In order for two companies to merge, sharedholders who wanted buy a competitor would have to individually purchase the controlling shares of the other company, and then sell the assets from one company to the other until the target company was dissolved. This would have a lot more natural friction than the board of directors negotiating a merger deal and just presenting it to whole body of shareholders as one yes\/no majority vote.\n\n* Responsibility, wisdom, and long-term stability are maximized when the consequences of actions are felt as closely as possible by the people making the decisions. When people own a corporation which owns another corporation which owns the majority another corporation, it's relatively easy for that bottom layer to be more separated from the oversight and management of the individuals who own the top corp, and for those people to be more insulated from what the bottom company does. By never being more than a single step removed from individual owners, there is more accountability when a corporation does something wrong.\n\n* It would reduce\/remove the need for direct government decisions on mergers. I think this is good since I really oppose the idea of government picking winners and losers. The government usually says the buyout is okay anyway, and those kinds of decisions are the most susceptible to hidden lobbying\/bribery\/corruption.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"An idea to simplify one aspect of anti-trust\/anti-monopoly laws"}

Then, bit by bit in countries of the  developed world, the death rate dropped, **by the 1960s by 98% or more. In the U.K., it dropped by an astounding 99.96%. And then, the measles vaccine entered the market.**  \n\n\nAfter  the vaccine\u2019s introduction, the measles death rate continued to drop into the 1970s. Many scientists credit the continued decline entirely to the vaccine. Other scientists believe the vaccine played a minor role, if that, noting that most infectious diseases similarly petered out  during the 20th century, including some, like scarlet fever, for which vaccines were never developed.\n\n# The  credit for the century-long decline, scientists generally agree, goes to improved nutrition and improved health care, side effects of the West\u2019s growing affluence. \n\n**In the U.S., the death rate dropped by about 98%, from about 10 per 100,000 population a century ago to one fifth of one person by 1963, the year measles vaccines made their American debut.**  Both before and after vaccination started, victims tended to be poor.  \n\n\nA study in the *American Journal of Public Health*,  \u201cMeasles mortality in the United States 1971-1975,\u201d found the measles  death rate to be almost 10 times higher among families whose median income was less than $5,000 than among families whose income exceeded a modest $10,000. Families outside metropolitan areas, who tended to have  poor healthcare, had three times the death rate.\n\nAn earlier, landmark study in the *American Journal of Epidemiolog*y by the Center for Disease Control\u2019s Roger Barkin found similar disturbing results of measles\u2019 toll on the disadvantaged. Here race entered the picture because black children were disproportionately victimized, not by the measles virus per se but by poverty. A poor black child and a poor white child had the same high chance of dying from measles, but because white children rarely lived in abject poverty,  measles claimed the blacks.  \n\n\nMeasles  didn\u2019t only discriminate by income \u2014 in another study, Barkin found  that children with underlying diseases were particularly vulnerable, and that the \u201cmajority of this group were physically or mentally retarded,  or both.\u201d The realization that measles was selective in whom it killed led Barkin to emphasize that vulnerable populations, rather than the general population, should be targeted for measles vaccination.  \n\n\nIn the pre-vaccine era, when the natural measles virus infected the entire  population, **measles \u2014 \u201ctypically a benign childhood illness,\u201d** as *Clinical Pediatrics*  described it \u2014 was welcomed for providing lifetime immunity, thus  avoiding dangerous adult infections. In today\u2019s vaccine era, adults have  accounted for one quarter to one half of measles cases; most of them involve pneumonia, one-quarter of them hospitalization.  \n\n\nAlso  importantly, measles during pregnancies have risen dangerously because  expectant mothers no longer have lifetime immunity. **Today\u2019s vaccinated  expectant mothers are at risk because the measles vaccine wanes with time and because it often fails to protect against measles.**  \n   \nA study in Houston of 12 pregnant women and one who had just given birth,  all of whom had measles, found one died, seven suffered pneumonia and seven hepatitis, four went through premature labour and one lost her child in a spontaneous abortion. A study of eight measles pregnancies in Japan found three ended in spontaneous abortions or stillbirths while four babies were born with congenital measles; two mothers endured pneumonia and one hemorrhagic shock. A Los Angeles study of 58 such pregnancies found 21 ended prematurely (three induced abortions, five  spontaneous abortions and 13 preterm deliveries); 35 of the 58 mothers were hospitalized, 15 contracted pneumonia, and two died.  \n   \nThe  danger extends to babies, whose bodies are too immature to receive  measles vaccination before age one, making them entirely dependent on  antibodies inherited from their mothers. In their first year out of the  womb, infants suffer the highest rate of measles infections and the most lasting harm. Yet vaccinated mothers have little antibody to pass on \u2014  only about one-quarter as much as mothers protected by natural measles \u2014  leaving infants vulnerable three months after birth, according to a  study last year in the *Journal of Infectious Diseases*.  HIV-infected children, who may account for most recent measles-related  child deaths, also suffer when their mothers have been vaccinated, since  HIV further reduces the antibodies they inherit.  \n\n\n**Factors  such as these increased the death rate for adults and the very young,  helping to reverse the decline in deaths seen in previous decades**,  according to a 2004 study in the *Journal of Infectious Disease*, authored by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  \n\n\nVaccines  for measles have had spotty safety records. Soon after their  introduction, the Vital Statistics of the United States began recording  deaths from the measles vaccine, along with deaths from other vaccines.  By 1970, one of the two original **measles vaccines was withdrawn in Canada and the U.S**. after causing atypical measles syndrome, a harsh disease triggering high rates of pneumonia. In 1975, **the second original vaccine was withdrawn** due to 103-degrees-plus fevers, among other severe side effects. **Two variants of this vaccine also proved  unsatisfactory**. **A measles vaccine then became part of the combination MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine in the 1980s, only to be withdrawn  in 1990 by Canada and in 1992** by the manufacturer after reports from Canada, the U.S., Sweden and Japan **blamed MMR for febrile convulsions,  meningitis, deafness and deaths**. A second version of MMR, now in  widespread use, is believed safe by government officials.\n\nSafety  aside, vaccines repeatedly failed worldwide in the 1980s and 1990s. As  described in \u201cMeasles Elimination in Canada\u201d, a 2004 report authored by  Canadian government officials and academics, \u201cdespite virtually 100%  documented one-dose coverage in some regions, large outbreaks of measles  involving thousands of cases persisted \u2026 Clearly, because of **primary  vaccine failure**, Canada\u2019s one-dose program was insufficient.\u201d\n\nThe  solution finally arrived at \u2014 adding a second dose for children \u2014  initially seemed to tame measles outbreaks. But in recent years, the new  vaccination regime, too, has been failing, with widespread outbreaks again occurring, including among those who have received the recommended dose and especially among infants too young to be vaccinated, and thus unprotected because their mothers had been vaccinated. Now health experts, scrambling to find solutions, are suggesting numerous reforms, including earlier child vaccinations and second doses for adults.\n\n# Clearly,  the science is not settled\n\nMaking for parents a numbers game of the  decision to vaccinate their children. Some parents rely on the press or  health authorities to interpret the numbers. Others defy the authorities  and weigh the risks in the numbers differently, in\u00a0deciding what\u2019s best  for their own families. Who are these others? According to a survey in Pediatrics,  **unvaccinated children in the U.S. have a mother who is at least 30  years old, who has at least one college degree and whose household has  an annual income of at least $75,000.** In the absence of studies showing vaccinated children to be healthier than those unvaccinated, the parents  in these educated households have determined that the numbers argue  against vaccination.\n\n[https:\/\/business.financialpost.com\/opinion\/lawrence-solomon-the-untold-story-of-measles](https:\/\/business.financialpost.com\/opinion\/lawrence-solomon-the-untold-story-of-measles)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The Untold Story of Measles"}

It emerged as a primitive perception regarding things like  truth and the nature of our existence, as well as a layer of  reinforcement against antisocial, uncooperative behavior (byproduct of  groupishness). By definition of a meme, the tenets of it worked in  comparison to other methods of survival. So, teachings like how to deal  with things that have been known to make us sick, how to behave in  relationships (no sex before marriage), etc. All things that worked for  people. This didn't necessarily give rise to people who were genetically  more built for religion, although it might have, but it definitely  would make people inclined to adopt those teachings. And now we see a  continuation of this with political correctness. People describe  themselves as secular, but they still have to believe in something.  Political correctness is a new age religion, especially on college  campuses, which have become cathedrals of social justice rather than  centers of inquiry. This also somewhat even extends to science, maybe  not to scientists themselves, but the way people put science on a  pedastel, thinking \"well these people give us a lot of cool stuff that  makes our lives better; let's follow them.\" and so the process  continues. And this is going to sound incredibly conceited, but is  something I think is nevertheless true. I'm convinced stupid people  actually aren't able to understand the actual principles of science, and  that perhaps intelligent people aren't able to understand religious  thinking. People with an interest in science tend to much more often be  on the autism spectrum, and it seems sensible that this disorder of not  being able to read emotions easily makes it easier for them to look at  things objectively.. This would suggest religious and objective  thinking are just byproducts of our innate dispositions. It's just  stupid people arguing with smart people.

This difference is certainly vast, yet, inasmuch as these strong governmental powers must be wielded by human agents, even as the powers of the despotism, it is, after all, only a difference in degree; and the tendency to demoralization and tyranny is the same, though the development of the evil results is much more gradual and slow in the one case than in the other.

Miller, medical research journalist and Director of the\u00a0*Thinktwice Global Vaccine Institute*\n\n**1. What is polio?**  \n\nPolio is a contagious disease caused  by an intestinal virus that may attack nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include fever, headache, sore throat, and vomiting. Some victims develop neurological complications, including  stiffness of the neck and back, weak muscles, pain in the joints, and  paralysis of one or more limbs or respiratory muscles. In severe cases  it may be fatal, due to respiratory paralysis.\n\n**2. How is polio contracted?**  \nPolio can be spread through contact with  contaminated feces\u00a0 (for example, by changing an infected baby\u2019s diapers) or through airborne droplets, in food, or in water. The virus enters the body by nose or mouth, then travels to the intestines where  it incubates. Next, it enters the bloodstream where \u201canti-polio\u201d  antibodies are produced. In most cases, this stops the progression of  the virus and the individual gains permanent immunity against the disease \\[1\\]. \n\nMany\u00a0 people mistakenly\u00a0believe that\u00a0anyone who\u00a0contracts polio will become paralyzed or die. However, in most infections caused by polio there are few distinctive symptoms  \\[2\\].In fact, **95 percent of everyone who is exposed to the natural\u00a0polio\u00a0 virus won\u2019t exhibit any symptoms, even under\u00a0 epidemic\u00a0  conditions** \\[3,4\\]**. About 5 percent of infected people will experience mild sympto**ms, such as a sore throat, stiff neck, headache, and  fever\u2014often diagnosed as a cold or flu \\[3,5\\]. Muscular paralysis has  been estimated to occur in about one of every 1,000 people who contract  the disease \\[3,6\\]. This has lead some scientific researchers to conclude that the small percentage of people who do develop paralytic polio may be anatomically susceptible to the disease. The vast remainder of the  population may be naturally immune to the polio virus \\[7\\]. \n\n**Injections:**  Several studies have shown that injections (for antibiotics or other  vaccines) increase susceptibility to polio. In fact, researchers have  known since the early 1900s that paralytic poliomyelitis often started  at the site of an injection \\[8,9\\]. When diphtheria and pertussis vaccines were introduced in the 1940s, cases of paralytic poliomyelitis skyrocketed (Figure 1) \\[10\\]. This was documented in *Lancet* and other medical journals \\[11-13\\]. In1949, the Medical Research Council in Great Britain set up a committee to investigate the matter and ultimately concluded that individuals are at increased risk of paralysis for 30 days following injections; injections alter the distribution of  paralysis; and it did not matter whether\u00a0the\u00a0injections were subcutaneous or intramuscular \\[14,15\\].\n\n**Figure 1. Polio cases skyrocketed after diphtheria and pertussis vaccines were introduced**\n\n[http:\/\/vaxtruth.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/Figure-1-Polio-copy1.jpg](http:\/\/vaxtruth.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/Figure-1-Polio-copy1.jpg)\n\nSeveral studies show  that injections increase susceptibility to polio. When diphtheria and pertussis vaccines were introduced in the 1940s, cases of paralytic poliomyelitis skyrocketed. \u00a0This chart shows the average number of polio cases per\u00a0100,000 people during five year periods before and after the vaccines were introduced. \u00a0\n\nSource: National Morbidity Reports taken from U.S. Public Health surveillance reports; Lancet (April 18, 1950), pp. 659-63.\n\nA 1992 study, published in the  Journal of Infectious Diseases, validated earlier findings. **Children who received DPT (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) injections were significantly more likely than controls to suffer paralytic  poliomyelitis within the next 30 days** \\[16\\]. According to the authors,  **\u201cthis study confirms that injections are an important cause of  provocative poliomyelitis** \\[16:444\\].\u201d \n\nIn 1995, the New England Journal of  Medicine published a study showing that children who received a single injection within one month after receiving a polio vaccine were 8 times  more likely to contract polio than children who received no injections.  The risk jumped 27-fold when children received up to nine injections  within one month after receiving the polio vaccine. And **with ten or more  injections, the likelihood of developing polio was 182 times greater  than expected** \\[17\\].\u00a0 Why injections increase the risk of polio is  unclear \\[18\\]. Nevertheless, these studies and others \\[19-24\\] indicate  that \u201cinjections must be avoided in countries with endemic poliomyelitis  \\[18\\].\u201d Health authorities believe that all \u201cunnecessary\u201d injections  should be avoided as well \\[18:1006;24\\]. \n\n**Nutritional deficiencies:**  A poor diet has also been shown to increase susceptibility to polio  \\[25\\]. In 1948, during the height of the polio epidemics, Dr. Benjamin  Sandler, a nutritional expert at the Oteen Veterans\u2019 Hospital,  documented a relationship between polio and an excessive use of sugars  and starches. He compiled records showing that countries with the  highest per capita consumption of\u00a0 sugar, such as the United States,  Britain, Australia, Canada, and Sweden (with over 100 pounds per person  per year) had the greatest incidence of polio \\[26\\]. In contrast, polio  was practically\u00a0 unheard\u00a0 of\u00a0 in\u00a0 China\u00a0 (with its sugar use of only 3  pounds per person per year) \\[26\\].\n\nDr. Sandler claimed that sugars and  starches lower blood sugar levels causing hypoglycemia, and that phosphoric acid in soft drinks strips the nerves of proper nourishment.  Such foods dehydrate the cells and leech calcium from the body. A  serious calcium deficiency precedes polio \\[26-29\\]. Weakened nerve trunks  are then more likely to malfunction and the victim loses the use of one  or more limbs \\[26:146\\]. \n\nResearchers have always known that  polio strikes with its greatest intensity during the hot summer months.  Dr. Sandler observed that children consume greater amounts of ice cream,  soft drinks, and artificially sweetened products in hot weather. In  1949, before the polio season began, he warned the residents of North  Carolina, through the newspapers and radio, to decrease their  consumption of these products. That summer, North Carolinians reduced  their intake of sugar by 90 percent\u2013 and polio decreased by the same  amount! The North Carolina State Health Department reported 2,498 cases  of polio in 1948, and 229 cases in 1949 (data taken\u00a0 from North Carolina  State Health Department figures) \\[26:146;29\\]. \n\nOne manufacturer shipped one million  less gallons of ice cream during the first week alone following the  publication of Dr. Sandler\u2019s anti-polio diet. Soft drink sales were down  as well. But the powerful Rockefeller Milk Trust, which sold frozen  products to North Carolinians, combined forces with soft drink business  leaders and convinced the people that Sandler\u2019s findings were a myth and  the polio figures a fluke. By the summer of 1950 sales were back to previous levels and polio cases returned to \u201cnormal\u201d \\[26:146;29\\].\n\n**3. Can polio be treated?** Paralytic polio is rarely  permanent. Usually there is a full recovery \\[30-34\\]. Muscle power begins  to return after several days and continues to improve during the next  12-24 months \\[30-34\\]. A small percentage of cases will experience  residual paralysis. In rare cases, paralysis of the muscles used to  breathe can lead to death \\[5:108;30-34\\]. \n\nTreatment mainly\u00a0 consists of putting  the patient to bed\u00a0 and allowing the affected limbs to be completely  relaxed. If breathing is affected, a respirator or iron lung can be  used. Physical therapy may be required. \n\n**4. Does a polio vaccine exist?**  \nIn 1947, Jonas Salk, an American physician and microbiologist, became head  of the Virus Research Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh. He was interested in developing a polio vaccine. In 1952, Salk combined three types of polio virus grown in cultures made from monkey kidneys. Using formaldehyde, he was able to \u201ckill\u201d or inactivate the viral matter so that it would trigger an antibody response without causing the disease. That year he began his initial experiments on human subjects.  \n\nIn 1953, his findings were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\u00a0 And in April of 1954 the nation\u2019s first polio  immunization campaign, directed at school children, was launched \\[35\\].  However,\u00a0shortly thereafter hundreds of people contracted polio from  Salk\u2019s vaccine; many died. Apparently, his \u201ckilled-virus\u201d vaccine was not completely inactivated \\[1\\]. The vaccine was redeveloped, and by  August 1955 over 4 million doses were administered in the United States.  By 1959, nearly 100 other countries were using Salk\u2019s vaccine \\[1,35\\]. \n\nIn 1957, Albert Sabin, another American physician and microbiologist, developed a live-virus (oral) vaccine against polio. He didn\u2019t think Salk\u2019s killed-virus vaccine would be effective in preventing epidemics. He wanted his vaccine to simulate  a real-life infection. This meant using an attenuated or weakened form of the live virus. He experimented with thousands of monkeys and  chimpanzees before isolating a rare type of polio virus that would  reproduce in the intestinal tract without penetrating the central  nervous system. The initial human trials were conducted in foreign  countries. In 1958, it was tested in the United States. And in 1963  Sabin\u2019s oral \u201csugar-cube\u201d vaccine became available for general use  \\[1,35\\].\n\n**5. Which vaccine is in use today?**  \nIn 1963, Sabin\u2019s oral vaccine quickly replaced Salk\u2019s injectable shot. It is cheaper to make, easier to take, and appears to provide greater\u00a0 protection,\u00a0including \u201cherd immunity\u201d in unvaccinated people.\u00a0 However, it cannot be given to people with  compromised immune systems \\[1,35\\]. Plus, it is capable of causing\u00a0polio  in some recipients of the vaccine, and in individuals with compromised immune systems who come into close contact with recently vaccinated children \\[1,35-38\\]. As a result, in January 2000, the CDC \u201cupdated\u201d its  polio vaccine recommendations, reverting back to policies first implemented during the 1950s: Children should only be given the killed-virus shot. The oral polio vaccine should only be used in \u201cspecial circumstances \\[39-41\\].\n\n**References:** \n\n[http:\/\/vaxtruth.org\/2012\/03\/the-polio-vaccine-part-1-2\/](http:\/\/vaxtruth.org\/2012\/03\/the-polio-vaccine-part-1-2\/)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The polio vaccine: a critical assessment of its arcane history, efficacy, and long-term health-related consequences"}

So how do the proponents of the \u201cgas attack\u201d story explain his report?\n\n-What about the fact that this month\u2019s OPCW report found there\u2019s no evidence that sarin was involved in the incident, directly contradicting the White House\u2019s claims? Additionally, the report didn\u2019t find that chlorine was involved either. Fisk\u2019s interviewees said that a heavy dust storm was all that had happened that day, and that it was then falsely reported as a chemical attack. After all we\u2019ve learned since the incident, does this version of events really sound like some kind of crazy conspiracy theory?\n\n-International law states that unless a country is attacked, they have no justification for attacking another country. An unprovoked attack is defined as the crime against peace, and it\u2019s the worst of all the war crimes.

For  example, Vermont reported 15 cases of polio during the one-year report period ending August 30, 1954 (before mass inoculations), compared to 55  cases of polio during the one-year period ending August 30, 1955 (after  mass inoculations)\u2013\u00a0 266% increase. Rhode Island reported 22 cases  during the before inoculations period as compared to 122 cases during  the after inoculations period \u2014 454% increase. In New Hampshire the  figures increased from 38 to 129; in Connecticut they rose from 144 to  276; and in Massachusetts they\u00a0 swelled\u00a0 from 273\u00a0 to 2027 \u2014 whopping  642% increase (Figure 2) \\[26:140;29:146;42\\].\n\n[Figure 2. Cases of polio increased in the U.S. after mass inoculations](http:\/\/vaxtruth.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/Figure-2-Polio_thumb.jpg)\n\nWhen  national immunization campaigns were initiated in the 1950s, the number  of reported cases of polio following mass inoculations with the  killed-virus vaccine was significantly greater than before mass  inoculations, and may have more than doubled in the U.S. as a whole.  Source: U.S. Government statistics.\n\nDoctors and scientists on the staff of the National Institutes of  Health during the 1950s were well aware that the Salk vaccine was  causing polio. Some frankly stated that it was **\u201cworthless as a  preventive and dangerous to take** \\[26:142\\].\u201d They refused to vaccinate  their own children \\[26:142\\]. Health departments banned the inoculations  \\[26:140\\]. The Idaho State Health Director angrily declared: **\u201cI hold the  Salk vaccine and its manufacturers responsible\u201d** for a polio outbreak  that killed several Idahoans and hospitalized dozens more \\[26:140\\]. Even  Salk himself was quoted as sa**ying: \u201cWhen you inoculate children with a  polio vaccine you don\u2019t sleep well for two or three** weeks \\[26:144;43\\].\u201d  But the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and drug companies  with large investments in the vaccine coerced the U.S. Public Health  Service into falsely proclaiming the vaccine was safe\u00a0 and\u00a0 effective  \\[26:142-5\\].\n\nIn 1976, Dr. Jonas Salk, creator of the killed-virus vaccine used **in the 1950s, testified that the live-virus vaccine (used almost exclusively in the U.S. from the early 1960s to 2000) was the \u201cprincipal if not sole cause\u201d of all reported polio cases in the U.S. since 1961**  \\[44\\]. (The virus remains in the throat for one to two weeks and in the  feces for up to two months. Thus, vaccine recipients are at risk, and  can potentially spread the disease, as long as fecal excretion of the  virus continues \\[45\\].) **In 1992, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published an admission that the live-virus vaccine had become the dominant cause of polio in the United States** \\[36\\]. In fa**ct, according to CDC figures, every case of polio in the U.S. since 1979 was caused by the oral polio vac**cine \\[36\\]. Authorities claim the  vaccine was responsible for about eight cases of polio every year \\[46\\].  However, an independent study that analyzed the government\u2019s own vaccine database during a recent period of less than five years uncovered 13,641 reports of adverse events following use of the oral polio  vaccine. These reports included 6,364 emergency room visits and\u00a0 540  deaths (Figure 3) \\[47**,48\\]. Public outrage at these tragedies became the  impetus for removing the oral polio vaccine from immunization sch**edules  \\[36:568;37;38\\].\n\n[Figure 3. Polio vaccine:\u00a0 adverse and serious adverse reactions](http:\/\/vaxtruth.org\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/Figure-3-Polio_thumb.jpg)\n\nIn  the mid-1990s, during a period of less than five years, there were 13,641 documented adverse reactions to the oral polio vaccine. 6,364 of these were serious enough to require hospital emergency room visits. 540 people died. \n\nSource: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting\u00a0 System (VAERS); OPV Vaccine Report: Doc. #14\n\nThe following story is typical of the damage associated with oral  polio vaccines: \u201cFour months ago my son was taken to a local clinic for his polio vaccine. I wasn\u2019t aware that he was going to have one, and would have prevented it if I had known. Unfortunately, he changed from that day \u2014 high-pitched screaming, smelly stools, non-stop crying, difficulty in breathing, high temperature, and lethargy. He also lost  weight. Weeks of sleepless nights for all of us followed. His  development ceased. He had been able to stand and move around, but he  went back\u00a0to remaining\u00a0in\u00a0basically whatever position we left him in.\n\n\u201cMy wife was six months pregnant at the time, and about a week after  our son\u2019s polio vaccine, she began to have headaches, loss of balance,  muscular weakness, and frequent tiredness. I panicked because everything  seemed to be pointing to polio infection.\u00a0 Then, a week after her  continuous headaches began, she had to go to the hospital because there  was something wrong with the pregnancy; she lost our daughter.\n\n\u201cI tried to get a polio test, and to find the cause of this tragic  series of events, but the medical profession was extremely unhelpful.  They laughed at me. I will never know why our son suddenly stopped  growing or why his development regressed. I will never know why we lost  our daughter. The only thing I am sure about is that the precursor to  these events was the polio vaccine.\u201d \\[From an unsolicited e-mail  received by the Thinktwice Global Vaccine Institute\u2014www.thinktwice.com\\]\n\nToday, fact sheets on polio published by the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services, warn parents that **the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) can cause \u201cserious problems or even death\u2026**\\[49\\]\u201d\u00a0 The  company that manufactures the current inactivated polio vaccine warns that **Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome**,\u00a0 a\u00a0 debilitating ailment characterized by muscular incapacitation and nervous system damage, \u201chas been temporally  related to administration of\u00a0another inactivated poliovirus vaccine  \\[3:780\\].\u201d And although this company makes the claim that \u201cno causal  relationship has been established,\u201d it also admits that \u201cdeaths have  occurred\u201d after vaccination of infants with IPV \\[3:780\\]. Yet, like the days of old, despite these \u201cdanger alerts,\u201d medical authorities continue  to assure parents that the currently available inactivated polio  vaccine is both safe and effective.\n\n[SOURCE](http:\/\/vaxtruth.org\/2012\/03\/the-polio-vaccine-part-2-2\/)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Are Polio Vaccines Safe?"}

This would be fine if Americans had willpower, but they are lazy and stupid and let themselves get fat even though there are children starving in Africa that need that food more. In the USSR, nobody was overweight or obese due to Stalin feeding his people according to the needs of the population. \n\nCapitalism allows all the money to concentrate into the pockets of the wealthy, who then buy our politicans and media, making America an oligarchy run by the rich. \n\nCapitalism encourages selfishness and discouraged putting the community before the individual, leading to a divided nation. A nation that is divided will not last, and the only reason America was kept together this long is because force was used (see the civil war). In a communist country like the Soviet Union (any pseudo commie that says the USSR wasn\u2019t real communism is deluding themselves), those who disagreed with and actively fought against Stalin\u2019s policies were rightfully killed. Communists kill the opposition because when dissenters are allowed liberty, they use that liberty to do whatever they can to try and stop the government, leading to a fractured nation. A united nation has no room for disagreement. The reason why communists are so quick to kill people is because said people are a detriment to society, and communists value individuals solely on what they contribute to their nation. Therefore, killing those with a negative value to society is good for the nation. Because human nature is inherently selfish, force is a requirement to get people to put the community before themselves. That is why Stalin was a great leader, and is why America needs communism.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Capitalism doesn\u2019t work"}

It's been missing this attitude, and since, they've been losing elections with a majority of voters *and* voting for socialists. It's that *ultimate* personal responsibility that gets you through the day, gets you hired, gets people to want to help you.\n\nThere's been a bit of unwinding of the moral fabric of society in this way. People don't want to give.\n\nI'm a centrist in that a lot of my ideas would be hated by the left, and many would be hated by the right, but I think that the fiscal right gets it *right* when it comes to the individual. I think they maybe should focus on more systematic efforts to train and educate people on how to be more model citizens, taking responsibility.\n\nThen again, if someone else fails to take responsibility and they lose a competitive advantage over those who do, that is an ideal system. And that is the gist of why socialism is oppressive. Yet, I think that most people should ultimately be *redeemable*. The right often goes too far right with fire and brimstone. I.e. they take the attitude that if you've made a lot of mistakes in life, you simply deserve it. It creates unequal opportunity where people would at first glance think that opportunity is equal.\n\nLets start with two people as a thought experiment. Person A has the same innate work ethic and moral compass as person B, but person A has responsible parents who understand things like personal responsibility. Person B gets spoiled as a child, and acts in an egocentric way until he or she gets out of the house and is beaten down by the reality of the world.\n\nIn some sense it's person B's fault that they didn't take care of themselves, but the expectation that they'd be able to without any sort of good parental platform is actually kind of ludicrous.\n\nPerson B simply needs the opportunity to redeem oneself, but not to \"make up for\" the position that person A has acquired by simply understanding personal responsibility and having had the discipline instilled to apply it.\n\nI think that we're mostly lost as people until we understand that we as individuals are mostly lost until we understand that basically everything happens to us is our responsibility. I.e. if a loved one dies, it's up to us to manage and help our other family members. If we lose our job, it's up to us to find another one and be more careful about not getting fired. If one of us is homeless, it's up to us to crawl our way out.\n\nIf people can't get access to medical care despite having a job, it's up to us to protest the horrendous patent laws that allow people to not have to compete with generic brands of medication. It's also up to us to learn more about healthcare and find out how to solve it.\n\nSo, instead of bitching at liberals for not being responsible, understand where they're coming from, but also let them know that they're failing John F. Kennedy in his famous quote that is the title of this thread when they happen vote for socialism as opposed to the typical Keynesianism or whatever the hell the left supports these days.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country."}

However,  according to Dr. Robert Mendelsohn, medical investigator and  pediatrician, there is no credible scientific evidence that the\u00a0vaccine  caused polio to disappear \\[50\\]. From 1923 to 1953, before the Salk  killed-virus vaccine was introduced, the polio death rate in the United  States and England had already declined on its own by 47 percent and 55  percent, respectively (Figure 4) \\[51\\]. Statistics show a similar decline  in other European countries as well \\[51\\]. And\u00a0 when the vaccine did  become available, many European countries questioned its effectiveness  and refused to systematically inoculate their citizens.\u00a0 Yet, polio  epidemics also ended in these countries \\[50\\].\n\n[Figure 4.

Source: International  Mortality Statistics (1981) by Michael Alderson.\n\nThe standards for defining polio were changed when the polio vaccine  was introduced. The new definition of a polio epidemic required more  cases to be reported. Paralytic polio was redefined as well, making it  more difficult to confirm, and therefore tally, cases. Prior to the  introduction of the vaccine the patient only had to exhibit paralytic  symptoms for 24 hours. Laboratory confirmation and tests to determine  residual paralysis were not required. The new definition required the  patient to exhibit paralytic symptoms for at least 60 days, and residual  paralysis had to be confirmed twice during the course of the disease.  Also, after the vaccine was introduced cases of\u00a0 aseptic meningitis (an  infectious disease often difficult to distinguish from polio) and  coxsackie virus infections were more often reported as separate diseases  from polio. But such cases were counted as polio before the vaccine was  introduced. The vaccine\u2019s reported effectiveness was therefore skewed  (Table 1 and Figure 5) \\[52,53\\].\n\n[Table 1.

His expert testimony was used as evidence during  Congressional hearings in 1962. He credited the \u201cdecline\u201d of polio cases  not to the vaccine, but rather to a change in the way doctors were  required to report cases: \u201cPrior to 1954 any physician who reported  paralytic poliomyelitis was doing his patient a service by way of  subsidizing the cost of hospitalization\u2026 two examinations at least 24  hours apart was all that was required\u2026 In 1955 the criteria were  changed\u2026 residual paralysis was determined 10 to 20 days after onset of  illness and again 50 to 70 days after onset\u2026 This change in definition  meant that in 1955 we started reporting a new disease\u2026 Furthermore,  diagnostic procedures have continued to be refined. Coxsackie\u00a0virus  infections and aseptic meningitis have been distinguished from  poliomyelitis\u2026 Thus, simply by changes in diagnostic criteria, the  number of paralytic cases was predetermined to decrease\u2026 \\[52:96,97\\]\u201d\n\n\\[50\\] Mendelsohn R.

Earlier today on this very sub, there was this weird thread where many people were decrying the evil of ticket scalping.  WTF.\n\nI'll rant on this a minute... First, three sources.  One is libertarian, the other two are mainstream.  It's not rocket science people.\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kCAXUfMGx34](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kCAXUfMGx34)\n\n[http:\/\/freakonomics.com\/podcast\/live-event-ticket-market-screwed\/](http:\/\/freakonomics.com\/podcast\/live-event-ticket-market-screwed\/)\n\n[https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/chris-tsakalakis\/why-reselling-tickets-is\\_b\\_643219.html](https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/chris-tsakalakis\/why-reselling-tickets-is_b_643219.html)\n\nThe roll of supply and demand is to equilibrate supply and demand.  If prices are too high not enough people will buy a good and there will be surpluses on the shelves, and sellers will have to lower their price to get rid of their excess.  If prices are too low there will be shortages!  More people will be willing to buy at that price then tickets or other goods are available.  The solution to the shortage is too raise prices so fewer people are willing buy, so that only the people who most care about the product will be able to get it.  \n\nThis helps minimize social cost!  If you get a ticket part of the cost is the opportunity cost that someone else could not get the ticket is incurred.  If someone else would have paid a higher maximum then you would have paid, then the value of the ticket to him is higher than too you.  By you holding the ticket and the person who values it more then you not there is a social loss that could be fixed if he could pay you higher then your max for the ticket, and then get it himself.  Of course the transaction cost of him finding you and haggling may be prohibitively high.  And so ticket scalpers come to the rescue.\n\nTickets are priced chronically too low, creating huge shortages.  Ticket scalpers come in and eliminate those transaction costs and make sure those who most want the tickets can get them.  Why are they priced too low in the first place?  Well, sometimes businesses will purposely not charge the equilibrium price so as to create good will.  Walmart for example is dedicated to their brand of low prices, so they would rather have empty shelves and send people to another store then raise their price and make more money in the short term, still selling out.  Show people are the same, for the purpose of optics they don't charge what they could get.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Ticket Scalping is a Service to Humanity!"}

If we are to treat a foetus as a full human being with rights, as we should, then we need to recognize that **no human, born or in utero, has the right to infringe on another's bodily autonomy without their express consent.** If a pregnant woman wants to have a tattoo in her uterus (bear with me) aren't her rights deprived by denying her the tattoo because it may be fatal for the foetus to have it done?\n\nI think a woman has the full right to void her uterus at any point of the pregnancy and see the death of the foetus as a result as insufficient cause to deny her this right- to me, it's demise is unfortunate but extraneous.\n\nThankfully, this also clears my conscience of the fetal murder dilemma wherein some argue that if someone murders a pregnant woman and the foetus dies, they should be charged for two murders. Prior to my newfound approach, I was unable to reconcile a foetus with no rights with a murder charge for causing it's death. **Now, I firmly believe that causing the death of a foetus- outside of any procedure in which the woman exercises her inextinguishable right to bodily autonomy- should be treated as murder.**\n\n# EDIT: Since I can't sticky my own comments, I'll make this point here since the airplane eviction principle (if you will) is being repeated and my replies are going to get buried.

{"author":"jetpacksforall","created_utc":1532605142,"num_comments":73,"score":6,"selftext":"The basic problem with Libertarianism is that it's incomplete as a political philosophy. As a result it offers no clear solutions to political issues facing a modern democracy. \n\nLibertarianism is built around a single overriding principle: limit state power. That's an agreeable enough principle, and in fact it is already widely accepted in western democracies. The need to limit state power is built into the US Constitution, and in varying degrees into all governments modeled after it. The ideal of \"liberty\" is at the center of all modern democracies.\n\nBut how do you implement liberty? How much should you limit state power? That's where Libertarianism falls on its face. \n\nTake fiscal policy. Most Libertarians will concede that some things are better paid for in common (roads, har har), but because Libertarianism is incomplete as a political philosophy, it has no coherent way to draw the line between public spending that is necessary vs. public spending that is corrupt\/coercive\/frivolous\/wasteful\/economically harmful. The result is that no two Libertarians can agree on where to draw that line. Ask them and you will see. The problem is that drawing that line is the single most important political question for a modern democracy. Given that nearly everyone in western countries agrees that state power should be limited to the greatest extent consistent with public welfare and fairness, the *single most difficult political question in those countries becomes how to determine what public spending is necessary and what is unnecessary*. \n\nWhen non-Libertarians see that the theory has no coherent answer for the most difficult and challenging questions in public life -- what should the government do, how should it do it, who should pay for it, how should it be limited -- then they quite rationally dismiss it as a solution to the modern world's problems. The Democratic Party in the US is notorious for being a circular firing squad, but they've got nothing on Libertarians who would pretty evidently tear one another to pieces once in power. All Libertarians believe that they are defending the most sacred of all values: the liberty of individual human beings. They're pretty passionate about that issue. And yet they can't agree among themselves on how exactly to do protect that value. It's a recipe for endless and very heated conflict. Not very useful in a democratic society.\n\nIf Libertarians want to become a mainstream political movement, they will need to develop a coherent political philosophy that can answer the question: \"Where do you draw the line between the state and individual liberty?\" Or in more practical terms, how can you get several hundred million people to reach consensus on an answer? Because that is the question everyone else is struggling over.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why people don't take Libertarianism seriously."}

They have become the way we live and the  way we die. Now, a study published in PLoS One has documented that  vaccinations may\tbe causing this plague.\n\nAnother study,[ Self-Organized Criticality Theory of  \t\t\tAutoimmunity](http:\/\/www.bibliotecapleyades.net\/archivos_pdf\/self-organized-theory-autoimmunity.pdf), produced a wide variety of tests on animals  to examine the fact that, as they stated:\n\nRepeated immunization with antigen causes systemic autoimmunity in mice otherwise not prone to spontaneous autoimmune diseases.\n\nThey concluded:\n\n&gt;Systemic  autoimmunity appears to be the inevitable consequence of   over-stimulating the host\u2019s immune \u2018system\u2019 by repeated \t\t\timmunization  with antigen, to the levels that surpass system\u2019s \tself-organized  criticality.\n\nIn other words, they found that, not only is vaccination a possible or even probable cause of autoimmune disorders, but that:\n\n**Chronic diseases are the inevitable result of vaccinations!**\n\nIn their introduction, the authors further describe their discovery:\n\n&gt;The  method we have chosen was to stimulate the system maximally by antigen  to the \tlevels far beyond its steady-state just like testing the  capability of automobile.\n\nIn  a perfectly reproducible experiments in which the mice not prone to  autoimmune diseases were immunized repeatedly with antigen, we have  unexpectedly and surprisingly discovered that \t\t\toverstimulation of  immune system beyond its self-organized \t\tcriticality inevitably leads  to systemic autoimmunity.\n\nThe mice used  in this experiment were ones bred to have no autoimmune disorders, so  the ability to stress them to the point of inevitably suffering from  autoimmune disorders is particularly significant.\n\n**Study Findings**\n\nT-cells, commonly called killer cells, are a type of lymphocyte  \t\t\t(white blood cell).\n\nThey  are a critical part of the immune system. CD4+ cells are a type of  T-cell. They initiate the body\u2019s response to infections. The study found  that overstimulation of CD4+ cells results in the induction of  \t\t\t autoantibodies, that is, antibodies that attack the self instead of  \t\t invaders. **That is virtually the definition of an autoimmune disease.**\n\nThe authors specifically found tissue injury like that of the  \t\t\tdisease lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune disorders.\n\nThe  researchers used Staphylococcus entertoxin B (SEB) to inject\t\tmice bred  for their lack of autoimmunity. Injection initially resulted in loss of  energy in a particular kind of CD4+ cell, V\u03b28+. These cells recovered  through 7 cycles of injections. However, the V\u03b28+ cells were unable to  recover after the 8th injection. At that point, they started to produce  the autoantibodies.\n\nThey found the following autoantibodies:\n\n&gt;IgG-rheumatoid factor (RF)IgM-RFAnti-Sm antibodyRF reactive against galactose-deficient IgG\n\nAs  the term rheumatoid factor seems to imply, these are significant in  rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disorder. The last item,  anti-galactose deficiency IgG antibodies, is used as a  \t\t\t[ marker to diagnose the disease](http:\/\/www.ra-genomics.com\/en\/about-rheumatoid-arthritis\/testing-for-rheumatoid-arthritis).\n\nThe  researchers also showed that ovalbumin (OVA) and keyhole limpet  hemocyanin, also induce autoimmunity after the 8th injection.\n\n**Autoimmune Tissue Damage**\n\nEosinophils. The authors included [graphic images](https:\/\/www.bibliotecapleyades.net\/imagenes_salud\/vacunas131_02.jpg) of autoimmune tissue damage from the experiments.\n\nThe  image above is of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the  kidneys of mice immunized 12 times. Both images are at 400X.\n\nThe  image on the left is (PBS) refers to a non-antigen injected. It shows  grossly enlarged eosinophils resulting from autoimmune damage. \tImmune  complexes (ICs) of proteinuria are indications of  \t\t\tautoantibodies.\n\n[This image](https:\/\/www.bibliotecapleyades.net\/imagenes_salud\/vacunas131_03.jpg)  shows the development of ICs of Immunoglobulin G (IgG), C3 (indicative  of lupus erythematosus), and OVA in mice injected 12 times. As in the  previous image, PBS refers to the results of the injection of a  \t non-antigen, and the results on the bottom are injection of the known \t antigen, OVA.\n\nThe image is of a microscopic magnification of 400X.\n\n[This image](https:\/\/www.bibliotecapleyades.net\/imagenes_salud\/vacunas131_04.jpg)  shows infiltration of CD8 cells in the kidneys and anti-interferon  (IFN) autoantibodies in mice injected 12 times. The image is of a  microscopic magnification of 300X.\n\nAs in the prior images, PBS refers to injection of a nonantigen and OVA is the injected antigen.\n\n**Types of Damage Found**\n\nThe authors state that they found the following types of tissue damage:\n\n&gt;Diffuse membranous (wire-loop) glomerulonephritis in the kidney\n\nProliferative  glomerulonephritis in the kidney. Infiltration of plasma cells around  hepatic bile ducts. Enlarged lymphoid follicles with marked germinal  center in the spleen. Occasional lymphocyte infiltration into the  salivary glands. Lymphoid cell infiltration into the thyroid.  Perivascular infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the skin  dermis of the auricle. Positive lupus\tband test\n\n**Autoimmune Diseases Are Infectious**\n\nThe  authors also reported that injection of the damaged CD4+ cells  \tinto  the autoimmune disease-safe mice transferred the damage to them.\n\nThe  implications of that are huge. It means that no one suffering from an  autoimmune disorder should be allowed to donate blood, because they  could also be donating their diseases.\n\n**Implications**\n\nThe Researchers Concluded\n\n&gt;**Systemic  autoimmunity appears to be the inevitable consequence of   over-stimulating the host\u2019s immune \u2018system\u2019 by repeated immunization  with antigen, to the levels that surpass system\u2019s self-organized  criticality.**\n\nStarting with the A\u2019s, \t\t\tautoimmune diseases include:\n\n&gt;Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)  \nAcute necrotizing hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis  \nAddison\u2019s disease  \nAgammaglobulinemia  \nAlopecia areata  \nAmyloidosis  \nAnkylosing spondylitis  \nAnti-GBM\/Anti-TBM nephritis  \nAntiphospholipid \tsyndrome (APS)  \nAutoimmune angioedema  \nAutoimmune aplastic anemia  \nAutoimmune dysautonomia  \nAutoimmune hepatitis  \nAutoimmune hyperlipidemia  \nAutoimmune immunodeficiency  \nAutoimmune inner ear disease  \nAutoimmune myocarditis  \nAutoimmune pancreatitis  \nAutoimmune retinopathy  \nAutoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura  \nAutoimmune thyroid disease  \nAutoimmune urticaria  \nAxonal &amp; neuronal neuropathies\n\nThen  comes the rest of the alphabet, including lupus erythematosus,  rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, chronic fatigue syndrome,  Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and frankly, too many others to list here.\n\n    Here\u2019s a more complete list http:\/\/www.aarda.org\/research_display.php?ID=47. \n\n&gt;Source   \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Self-Organized Criticality Theory of \tAutoimmunity](http:\/\/www.plosone.org\/article\/info:doi\/10.1371\/journal.pone.0008382), by Ken Tsumiyama, Yumi Miyazaki, Shunichi Shiozawa","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Vaccination contributes to causing a wide variety of autoimmune disorders."}

The study only lists the top 10 causes of death, and for whites \"interpersonal violence\" doesn't even make it.\n\nTo get the actual numbers you have to go to the [appendix](https:\/\/ars.els-cdn.com\/content\/image\/1-s2.0-S2214109X16301139-mmc1.pdf) I think it's Table 3B.\n\nFrom 2000-2012, the number of white deaths from violence declined from about 700-500, a 28 percent drop. And that equals about 3 percent of total deaths vs. 9 percent white population. This is slightly higher than the percentage reported based on an analysis of murder dockets back in 2003. And, even though interpersonal violence is a slightly broader category than murder, you get a rough estimate of a white murder rate of about 11 per 100,000 vs 33 per 100,000 for the country as a whole.\n\nMost of the top 10 causes of death among black people include  diseases of poverty, violence and the number 1 is AIDS, which killed a mind-blowing 150,000 people in 2012.\n\nWhite people mostly die of diseases of affluence like ass-cancer and the gout (I'm making that one up). The number one killer is heart disease, accounting for nearly 19 percent of deaths or about 8400.\n\nSo doing the math, fat colonizer swine are about 17 times more likely to die from eating too goddamn much than they are to be murdered by each other or by black people.\n\nfacts.\n","subreddit":"ChapoTrapHouse","title":"Effort Post: Big Macs are killing more Afrikaners than \"white genocide.\"""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Effort Post: Big Macs are killing more Afrikaners than \"white genocide.\""}

{"author":"LDL2","created_utc":1532670079,"num_comments":20,"score":8,"selftext":"I spawned some interest on another thread so started a fresh one.  I also invited \/r\/GoldandBlack since I'm not always great at getting back to people these days.\n\nFirst thing to understand about private courts is there are several important institutions:  In libertopia we use DROs (dispute resolution organizations) aka courts.  Another source we use is insurance.  Insurance works two-fold.  It acts both as a cost limiting factor in many instances but also as a valuation of reputation.  \n\nFirst lets talk about what is crime- in libertarian society it would be NAP violations and within those reciprocal responses are generally preferred in the immediate an restitution in the long term.  The goal of criminal court is restitution not punishment.  However that restitution falls upon the principle actor of the crime and obviously some punishment may be involved or the rich can simply buy away murder.  Modern criminal courts only focus on punishment.  So the most obvious crimes are those to life, person, and property or rape assault murder and theft.  I will circle back to these.\n\nSo I take out a policy with my insurance that is focused on monetary damages for many cases.  The cost is part of some subset of premiums that likely escalate greatly as the cost of the premium only really focuses on court costs and increasing payouts probably increase length of battles.  If you are ruled to be a murderer you'd have to pay the restitution up to my policy value.  Basically that person spends their time paying back their insurance because immediate payment would go hand in hand with a guilty verdict.\n\nSo what don't pay right?  Insurance acts as a value of reputation.  Your presence is a risk many places.  They vouch for you to not shoot up Walmart. Not paying basically isolates yourself.  No voucher...limits your options.  Even private roads.  You basically go into house arrest.  You keep breaking that you may go to a penal colony focused on indentured servitude to pay back and for your maintenance.  Outside of LEO which I think we can imagine as a private organization the inner workings of finding a court are now similar.  Even if I pay immediately my reputation and my insurance may be so high as to limit people vouching for me until a company is willing to take that risk.\n\nTheft may fall more into civil cases despite being more truly criminal.\n\n\nOk in civil court or disputes it is quite simple.  Lets say you and I contest ownership of a computer.  We can agree as many people do to meet before a judge with no coercion because we are both rational individual who would like this solved.  This is the same thing that happens on judge judy today.\n\nLets say you can produce a contract that says the computer was yours because it arrived as the work of our business together and you had all tech products as yours.  Furthermore in most situations whereby civil cases would occur, contracts would also occur and specify the location of such arbitration.  It then no longer matters which judge I want.  \n\nBut lets say you are just my buddy and I lent my computer to you with no contract because I'm a fool.  Similarly if this goes to court without a reply from me whatsoever, they may rule [in absentia](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/In_absentia).  \n\nLets say I blow up and say I don't want to meet with Judy she's a cunt and Judge Joe Brown is cooler and his proclivity for rapping verdicts makes me believe he will rule in my favor because I too am a rapper.  Ok so now we have it down to situations where there is no contract, and we cannot agree about whom to use as our dispute resolution organization (DRO).  I want Joe Brown and you want Judy.  In theory it should not matter, right?  Lets say Judy is widely known as person who lets people walk off with other's property if they appear less well to do.  The easiest solution upon competing resolutions is a combined resolution organization.  We would argue before Joe and Judy who would then need to privately come to a conclusion.  If one of these two in private is not acting reputably they may be reported to another organization which monitors reputable DROs, which would deal more with internal liscensing among the group ad they are at risk of their reputation and future business  edit 4- you still don't like it and refuse to show before your own 50% choice again absentia.  And we are paying for 2 times the service so obviously it is in our favor to find a neutral group.\n\nNow lets say everything didn't go my way.  I have to give you the computer but I refuse.  Two major arguments can be presented here.  One you are now a legitimate target for having previously violated a contract to violent and justifiable retrieval.  Great you say for the weak, what about the rich guy who has 10 armed guards. This would be potentially as bad.  You would have yourself blacklisted as the person who doesn't follow throw with legitimate contractual obligations and blacklisted effectively from any contract but the riskiest of takers who know you don't follow through on your word this again is in part the cost of your insurance.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Private Courts"}

So let's clear that out of the way. Effectively M3 or M4 is the de facto true inflation metric in the current financial system.\n\n\nHowever because the current money system is so complex, the water that you pump into the 1 end of the pipe won't be equal to the water coming out of the other end of pipe, so if you put your sensor at the beginning, that is the de facto water pumped in, but there will be losses, some of the water will flow back, and the water will not come out with the same pressure at the other end, so it will have a time delayed propagation, plus if it's a multi-pipe system, in some pipes it will come out quicker while at other it will come out slower.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo when we measure inflation the other end, which is really what only effects our true wealth, it might be different than the M3 metric, so if we want to be more accurate we need to look at the price changes, hence: **PRICE INFLATION**\n\n\nSo inflation is assymetric and propagates in a weird way into every market, so it has to be measured and somehow quantified at the price end. Of course normally you have the CPI for that, which is a totally shitty metric I tell you. \n\n* The CPI purpusefully excludes real estate, stocks , bonds and commodities, which is ironic because that is where most of the money goes.\n* The price data is collected by random sampling (question is whether the sample is big enough and random enough)\n* It is weighted but the weights seem arbitrary, it should be weighted by transaction volume instead of some random number\n* The formula uses normal ratios instead of log ratios, massive mistake that any statistician with half a brain would avoid\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo overall the effect of the CPI is that it massively underestimates inflation, and I mean massively. The only thing worse from a statistical standpoint would be if they would use a geometric average, that would just be peak cretinism.\n\nNow are the government statisticians so dumb to not realize this that any amateur statistician would? I doubt it, so the only conclusion is that they are purpusefully trying to donwplay inflation.\n\nIt's bad enough that fiat currencies lose 99.9% of their value in a century, but imagine if the inflation would be accurately calculated, it probably loses 99.9% of it's value in just a few decades.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere is also another factor which nobody talks about namely: **shrinkflation** and **qualityflation**\n\nWhere the quantity and the quality of the products shrink in a deceptive way but their price stays the same or even rises. We all know those cereal boxes now barely contain stuff but are filled with air to make it look more heavy. Or when they replace healthy bio food with GMO crap to cut costs but you get cancer instead.\n\nThat is not even quantified by the CPI, so you definitely have massive inflation at work here.\n\nFiat currency is the biggest scam that has ever existed in the history of humanity.","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"Inflation Scam""num_comments":0,"score":3,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Inflation Scam"}

Did you transition from one belief to it? What was the main factor that turned you into a libertarian or reinforced your beliefs? Anything else you wish to include, please include! \n\nMy little back story is that when I first got into politics around the age of fifteen, I was a liberal (had liberal parents and was surrounded by liberal culture) and honestly I was a fucking asshole. I wanted more and more government to \"help protect\" people. I was anti-gun, pro high taxes, and all that leftist junk. Transition into when I was 17-18 and the election came around. By this point i was sick of the two parties and found myself a Bernie supporter (jesus christ) and declared myself socialist. \n\nTHANKFULLY by the grace of God, I read 1984 and Animal Farm and it quickly changed my perspective on government. It scared the hell out of me. Why did it scare me? Because I saw everything that the book was talking about, happening right around me. Within a year after reading those I became very critical of government and eventually realized I was a libertarian. Now i'm pro=gun, want to eliminate taxes, and truly believe that the individual deserves their own version of their freedom. \n\nNow a year after that I have embraced my transition of beliefs and try to spread the ideology with discussion and debate.

Then progress is charted on who gets better, who gets worse, and conclusions are drawn. In theory there should be no bias as to reporting because the researchers don\u2019t know who is in the placebo or the real intervention group.\n\nHow many vaccines currently on the CDC Vaccine Schedule have ever been studied in this manner?  ZERO!  \n\nThe reason?  \n\nResearchers say they cannot perform an RCT because it would be unethical to NOT give a child a vaccine because if that child dies of something that could have been prevented, then they don\u2019t want to be responsible. \n\nIt is unethical to not give someone something that has not been proven safe or effective.\n\nRead that again.\n\nBut if someone dies in their trials from taking their anti-depressants, it must be OK. But moving on.\n\nHow about primate studies?\n\nThere are plenty of unvaccinated populations to compare disease transmission and side effects to.\n\n\\-The Amish.\n\n\\-Nearly all of Portland.\n\n\\-Christian Scientists. \n\nBut I digress....\n\nInstead of research to see safety and effectiveness, they instead see  if the person builds anti-bodies to the antigen (the foreign invader)  that is in the vaccine.  If antibodies are built, then it\u2019s \u2018safe and effective,\u2019 or so they lead us to believe.  These studies are rarely, if ever done on kids younger than 4 years old.  How can you say it\u2019s safe or effective for a baby if it\u2019s never studied on a baby?\n\n**The 2 populations that have limited production of anti-bodies are infants and geriatrics, the 2 most heavily vaccinated populations.**  If they can\u2019t produce anti-bodies, then the vaccine would be pointless. The whole premise of the vaccine is that you get injected with a foreign invader and you produce anti-bodies against it.  If you can\u2019t produce anti-bodies well then what\u2019s the use of injecting something to try and stimulate that reaction?\n\nWith kids, they don\u2019t produce any anybodies until after age 6 months. So why give a vaccine to anyone under the age of 6 months if they  can\u2019t produce antibodies.  Even if the whole vaccine theory really  worked, it would be absolutely pointless to inject a baby of 6 months or less with a vaccine .  With a child\u2019s immune system being very immature until age 2, but by 18 months they have been overloaded with 36 vaccines. But with all the above, why start using logic and common sense now?\n\n[Source](http:\/\/healthimpactnews.com\/2013\/dr-kurt-why-i-will-never-choose-to-vaccinate-my-own-son-and-any-future-kids-my-wife-and-i-have\/?hc_location=ufi#sthash.voArnfLx.dpuf)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The Gold Standard in research design is the double blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

From my understanding, libertarianism requires no obligation from one person to another, financially or otherwise. Thus, we\u2019re all in agreement on a policy of abolishing welfare and government funded social safety nets, correct? In order for someone to live in modern society it is necessary for the individual to generate wealth or product to then be traded for goods and services. My question is in a developed country what becomes the expectation of disabled\/underage\/elderly citizens? If a person is born severely disabled, and can not generate wealth or product, does libertarianism determine that said individual is legally not a  responsibility of anyone and therefore should be left homeless and starving and that\u2019s just the end of it? Furthermore does everyone on this board agree with that statement? I have discussed this with a few like minded friends and their answer was essentially a yes. A few argued that social welfare systems would flourish privately in a \u201ctrue libertarian\u201d society. That there would somehow be a large enough group of people and donations working for nothing to support the most needy members of the population. As nice of a thought as this is, I\u2019m having trouble being convinced that it\u2019s a viable solution. In terms of homeless shelters and orphanages I can see volunteer and charity groups covering those populations alright, but what about the people who need high cost medical for decades at a time? Or rural areas where there is little incentive or extra money to help run programs? All the people I\u2019ve had this discussion with made arguments for the private safety net situation and yet unanimously agreed they would not give money or time to members of society who could give nothing back. Is it not a possibility then that the same thing would happen on a national scale? Where everyone agrees it\u2019s a nice idea but no one wants to be forced to give any of their own time\/income? I\u2019m not here to make an argument for socialism, I\u2019m just curious about if there is any kind of agreement amongst libertarians about how to handle this specific problem. Also if someone could recommend further reading on the subject I\u2019d really appreciate it. \n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Conflicted feelings on humanitarian aspects of libertarian philosophy"}

This, they argue, is to make up for the costs of R&amp;D it took to make the product. People against the patent system claim the system gives an unfair monopoly, driving up prices and driving down quality. I myself am against the patent system, but also see how innovation could be decentivized without some kind of reward (especially if it almost always results in a loss).  The alternative is something known as the Prize System, a method coined by Joseph E. Stiglitz. The Prize System awards people a sum of money for discovering a new drug but doesn't give them monopoly power over the drug. Some may support a tax on individuals to pool in a fund to redistribute to innovators. I don't agree with that method at all. Rather, I'll take another way out. The main concern here is that companies won't be able to recoup the losses seen by R&amp;D. So, what about this: we take a certain percentage out of the sales tax of that good (no matter which companies sells it) and give that money back to the innovators until the costs of R&amp;D are recovered. Then the sales tax would all be taken by the government afterwards. Say this sales tax at the time is 10%. 9% of the sales tax would go to the government and 1% would go to the innovator. Give me a bit of feedback on this please, suggest alternatives, or tell me why it's better to have a full patent system or no reward system.

The libertarian idea for immigration is an open border policy. At face value, this may seem akin to the democratic idea of open borders. However the difference here is actually a significant one. The democratic approach makes no distinction between the difference of eliminating state borders and eliminating private property borders. To this end, there is clear differences even within the fundamentals of the two policies. This is why I think we need to be cautious about going soft on the democratic immigration policy just for the purpose of undermining the current one. If we allow ourselves to fall victim to the idea of a joint campaign with the democrats over the border, we will inevitably be jeopardizing libertarian values in the process. Anyone who is libertarian, as a basic obligation, believes in the right or social precondition of individuals to justly acquire property and reject aggressions against the same. Those who reject the right or necessity of individuals to own property and use it without unwanted interference are undermining our belief structure. Questions to personal vs private property are without virtue. Collectivists have their mind set on the idea of factories and large scale goods when they pretend this is an important distinction. Once we realize, however, there is a vast multitude of goods between a xbox for entertainment and a automobile factory for manufacturing, the difference is quickly unmasked as an irrational one. Some of the immigration into the United States is not helpful. \n\nAkin to the way that a wheat subsidy would cause wheat farmers to grow too much wheat for market demand. Government subsidies to immigration cause more of it than what would be occurring in a free market. We should strive to reduce or abolish such government interference whenever possible. Most of our problems in regards to immigration can be fixed, or greatly reduced, just by cutting government spending. In Mexico, and other countries south of the US, high profits for drug cartels put farmers at a competitive disadvantage by forcing them to bid against the cartels for land and resources. Even in cases where the cartels don\u2019t use criminal tactics to get their way, the purchasing power of the cartels means more Mexican farmers are encouraged to head north where instead of owning their own farm in their home country, they are illegal employees of farms in the US. These are situations where the immigrant probably didn't even have desire to leave their land in the first place. Of course you also have the problem of violent drug dealers crossing the border with drugs. Ending the drug war is very practical, and will have beneficial effects for people on both sides. In addition to ending the drug war, the extensive protectionist interventions into agriculture have the effects of artificially holding up US farms that the market would not otherwise support, ensuring higher prices for US consumers.\n\nAgain harming farmers south of the US border. Without these interventions, Mexican farmers could dominate in many agricultural products, giving them the opportunity to be successful farmers in their home country. As opposed to forcing them to become citizens and employees north of the border. Then there's the problem of welfare. For natives and immigrants, welfare rewards failure and punishes success. It's an immoral transfer of wealth, it contributes to the destruction of families, and it displaces private charity. It also attracts freeloaders, causing excessive immigration while local born workers sit useless. It should be reduced or abolished wherever possible. Also decentralization will aid. Giving control of lands to the municipal governments would be an improvement. Local level officials are much more susceptible to local political pressure, have smaller budgets with which to do harm, and will more closely represent the desires of their citizenry than feds. Also we should be enforcing the property rights of the individual! In the absence of state border control, property owners on the border could take charge. Rather than rounding up peaceful families, and setting up inland checkpoints, they could focus on those who pose actual threats to their property. I don't really see much of a compromise on the immigration issue. Both of the mainstream opposing views seem very much \nintolerable and will only cause more finical devastation on our country.

With this foreknowledge the series of catastrophic events that followed the most intensive campaign of mass poisoning in known human history, should not have surprised the experts. Yet, far from admitting a causal relationship so obvious that in any other field of biology it would be instantly accepted, virtually the entire apparatus of communication, lay and scientific alike, has been devoted to denying, concealing, suppressing, distorting and attempts to convert into its opposite, the overwhelming evidence. Libel, slander and economic boycott have not been  overlooked in this campaign.\u00a0  \n   \nEarly in 1949, as a result of studies during the previous year, the author published reports implicating DDT preparations in the syndrome widely attributed to a \"virus-X\" in man, in \"X-disease\" in cattle and in often fatal syndromes in dogs and cats. The relationship was promptly denied by government officials, who provided no evidence to contest the author's observations but relied solely on the prestige of government authority and sheer numbers of  experts to bolster their position.  \n   \n \\[\"X-disease\"\\] ...studied by the author following known exposure to DDT and related compounds and over and over again in the same patients, each time following known exposure. We have described the syndrome as follows:\u00a0  \n \"...In acute exacerbations, mild clonic convulsions involving mainly the legs, have been observed. Several young children exposed to DDT developed a limp lasting from 2 or 3 days to a week or more.\u00a0  \n   \nSimultaneously with the occurrence of this disorder \\[X-disease\\] a number of related changes occurred in the incidence of known diseases. The most striking of these is poliomyelitis. In the United States the incidence of polio had been increasing prior to 1945 at a fairly constant rate, but its  epidemiologic characteristics remained unchanged. Beginning in 1946 the\u00a0*rate of increase more than doubled*.  Since then remarkable changes in the character of the disease have been noted. Contrary to all past experience, the disease has remained epidemic year after year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Morton S.

An armed robber who knows a house contains something valuable may then do some quick calculation and decide he's good enough with a gun to give himself a good chance of besting the armed homeowner. Then the robbery is a go in the expected value sense. If however, he knows that even if he beats the homeowner and pulls off the robbery, he will be wanted and pursued by law enforcement, suddenly the robbery is no longer worth trying; the mere threat of being pursued by the law has prevented the crime.

{"author":"PrestigiousProof","created_utc":1532832532,"num_comments":30,"score":0,"selftext":"The herd immunity theory was originally coined in 1933 by a  researcher called Hedrich. He had been studying measles patterns in the US between 1900-1931 (years before any vaccine was ever invented for measles) and observed that epidemics of the illness only occurred  when less than 68% of children had developed a natural immunity to it. This was based upon the principle that children build their own immunity after suffering with or being exposed to the disease.\n\n# Herd immunity was about natural disease processes and had nothing to do with vaccination.\n\n**-If 68% of the population were allowed to build their own natural defences, there would be no raging epidemic.**\n\nLater on, vaccinologists adopted the phrase and increased the figure from 68% to 95% with no scientific justification as to why, and then stated that there had to be 95% vaccine coverage to achieve immunity. Essentially, they took Hedrich\u2019s study and manipulated it to promote their vaccination programmes.1\n\n# Why Vaccine Induced Herd Immunity is Flawed\n\n**If vaccination really immunizes, then your vaccinated child will be immunized and therefore protected against any disease an unvaccinated  child gets. If he isn\u2019t, his shots didn\u2019t work.**\n\nThe concept of herd immunity is often used as a way to push guilt at people who don\u2019t line up, with their children, like robots for their shots.\n\nFrom the point of view of protecting people who are already vaccinated, herd immunity is flat-out absurd.\n\nLittle Jimmy, whose parents have decided not to vaccinate him, will  pass diseases on to kids who are already vaccinated? Oh, you mean those immunized kids aren\u2019t really safe? **Then why did you vaccinate them in  the first place?**\n\nFrom another point of view, herd immunity is the  idea that people who \u201ccan\u2019t be\u201d vaccinated (for example, those who are  obviously allergic to elements contained in vaccines) will gain a  measure of protection, if larger and larger numbers of others are  vaccinated.\n\nThe vaccinated protecting the unvaccinated.\n\nThis is foolish, because **what actually protects people against  disease is the strength of their immune systems, and that strength has  nothing to do with vaccination.**\n\nIf a person has a weak immune system, he will get dangerously sick,  and it doesn\u2019t matter how many people around him are vaccinated against how many diseases.\n\nEven if one accepts the (false) premise that vaccines are effective and safe, the premise of herd immunity is ludicrous.\n\nThere are many doctors who know this, but they refuse to speak out, because they know they\u2019ll suffer consequences.\n\nVaccination,  as a propaganda strategy, is used to medicalize the population\u2014to  assert that good health is fundamentally a medical matter.\n\nIt isn\u2019t.\n\nThe health of populations has everything to do with good nutrition,  adequate sanitation, and an absence of toxic elements in the  environment. Not on shots full of aluminum, mercury and fetal bovine serum (actual vaccine ingredients).\n\n[SOURCE](http:\/\/healthimpactnews.com\/2013\/the-herd-immunity-myth-treating-our-children-like-cattle-2\/)\n\n[SOURCE](https:\/\/www.activistpost.com\/2014\/11\/vaccines-and-herd-immunity-nonsense.html)\n\n1\u201cMonthly estimates of the child population \u2018susceptible\u2019 to measles,  1900-1931, Baltimore, Maryland\u201d; A W Hedrich; American Journal of  Epidemiology; May 1933 \u2013 Oxford University Press.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"What Herd Immunity Is and Why the Theory is Flawed"}

Lengthy delays and an adversarial tone characterize the program.\n\nBy Clifton B. Parker \n\nThe safety net that Congress created to protect children who suffer from vaccine injury is not working as intended, a Stanford law professor has found.\n\n**\"The bottom line is that the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was supposed to offer 'simple justice' to vaccine-injured children. But it has largely failed to do so,\"** wrote Stanford law Professor [Nora Freeman Engstrom](https:\/\/www.law.stanford.edu\/profile\/nora-freeman-engstrom) in a new research [article](http:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2623756).\n\n### Outside the court system\n\nCreated by Congress in 1986 as the problem of vaccine injury hit crisis proportions, the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, or VICP, is a no-fault compensation system housed within the U.S. Court of Claims and funded by a 75-cent tax on each vaccine dose administered across the country.\n\nVCIP uses a no-fault alternative dispute resolution system for resolving vaccine injury claims. Known as an \"alternative compensation mechanism,\" it is similar to workers' compensation funds or the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund in providing payment to injured individuals outside the traditional court system.\n\nThe vaccine fund has adjudicated more than 14,000 petitions for vaccine injury since its beginning in 1986. In her research, she analyzed nearly three decades' worth of data concerning the program's operation.\n\n**\"The results are discouraging,\"** she said. **\"Despite initial optimism in Congress and beyond that such a fund could resolve claims efficiently and amicably, in operation the program has been astonishingly slow and surprisingly combative.\"**\n\nFor example, **Congress originally established a 240-day deadline for all adjudication decisions. But Engstrom reported that, in reality, the average adjudication takes over five years.** \"This is years longer than similar claims resolved by court judgment or trial verdict within the traditional tort system,\" she said.\n\nThe tone and nature of the experience is also disillusioning, she noted. Though claims within the system are supposed to be amicably resolved, in reality \"the resolution of petitions is frequently antagonistic,\" she said.\n\nEngstrom found that even when children are found to be entitled to compensation, governmental lawyers have sometimes hassled petitioners over relatively piddling amounts. For example, **in one case, a dispute arose whether a 14-year-old girl with profound mental retardation was or was not entitled to a $40 pair of high-top tennis shoes.**\n\nPerhaps as a result, Engstrom said, the vaccine program has heavily relied on lawyers. Early on, some hoped that procedures would be straightforward and collaborative enough to make it unnecessary to hire counsel. But Engstrom discovered that petitioners need counsel \u2013 and often highly specialized legal help \u2013 to have any chance at successfully resolving their claims.\n\n### Lessons learned\n\nOriginally, she said, the vaccine compensation program was supposed to represent a simple and effective safety net that would encourage more parents to immunize their children.\n\nApplying that logic, she said, \"If we want to convince more American parents to vaccinate their children, improving the VICP could help.\"\n\nSecond, the findings, she said, shed light on the effectiveness of health courts and other options for resolving disputes beyond traditional courts, which are often suggested as possible solutions to medical malpractice litigation problems.\n\nEngstrom calls health courts the \"tort reform *du jour*.\" In fact, legislation to enact health courts has been introduced in several state legislatures and both houses of Congress.\n\nShe said health courts would take medical malpractice cases out of the traditional court system and relocate them to a specialized venue. Health court supporters suggest that this relocation would promote faster, more predictable and less adversarial resolutions of disputes.\n\nBut Engstrom wrote that the vaccine fund example is cause for great concern: \"Moving cases outside the court system in no way guarantees that claim resolution will be fast, simple or straightforward.\"\n\nShe noted, \"Before we charge forward in creating new compensation systems, we ought to make sure we understand how our past experiments with tort reform have fared \u2013 and we've got to learn the sometimes bitter lessons that come from our past mistakes.\"\n\n## Media Contact\n\nNora Freeman Engstrom, Stanford Law School: (650) 736-8891, [nora.engstrom@law.stanford.edu](mailto:nora.engstrom@law.stanford.edu)\n\nClifton B.

Proponents of  voluntary vaccination stress this right.**\n\nCritics argue that, if we can use force to stop a knife-wielding  thug, we can use force to stop someone from infecting others, even unintentionally. But at least one cluster of difficulties ought to be of great concern even to those who think this argument works (there isn\u2019t space here to talk about why it might not): the negative consequences of  a forcible vaccination program would be serious and far-reaching.  \n\nProponents of compulsory vaccination want the government to vaccinate their neighbors. **Implementing a large-scale state program of mandatory vaccination would dramatically increase the level of government intrusion in people\u2019s lives.**\n\n**Like the \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d such a program would feature incentives for extensive government monitoring**. Pediatricians would confront new  reporting requirements. Home-schooling parents would be monitored for  compliance. New levels of intrusion would spawn new secondary crimes, as  people were punished not only for failing to comply with vaccination mandates but also for failing to provide information needed to implement these mandates. Government agencies would demand new surveillance  powers and technologies. Those with state power would find it hard to  resist the temptation to seek more\u2014more power, more budget dollars.\n\nAt the same time, a mandatory vaccination program would create new  incentives for what economists call \u201crent-seeking.\u201d **Well-connected  businesses would welcome opportunities to boost their profits at the  public\u2019s expense.** Those that manufacture vaccines, often worried by anticipated profit declines as drug patents expire, would doubtless find reason to lobby\u2014in the public interest, of course\u2014for mandates that  would dramatically increase their captive markets. (The Affordable Care  Act already requires insurers to provide vaccines at low costs.) **More and more illnesses could be expected to be added the list of those to be  met with compulsory vaccination\u2014enabling these markets to expand  without reference to consumer demand**. Makers of monitoring technology  would surely find multiple opportunities to encourage legislators to  boost government contracting opportunities.  \n\n**Any appeal to \u201csave our children\u201d is likely to be met with hysterical enthusiasm.** So the vaccine manufacturers will continue to be protected against liability, as they are now, by federal law. (Taxpayers are on the hook for some injuries in virtue of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Not only does this unfairly burden people who  aren\u2019t responsible for making or marketing unsafe products, but it reduces the incentive for manufacturers to concern themselves with safety.)\n\nWhile federal regulation of mandatory vaccines might reduce some  dangers, manufacturers\u2019 incentives to keep risks at appropriate levels  would be dampened by \u201cregulatory capture.\u201d Those who regulate key industries are usually drawn from those industries\u2019 top executives. And  even when regulators come from outside, regulatory agencies typically  depend on the regulated industries for information about products, standards of care, and so forth. The kind of regulation we could expect doesn\u2019t inspire confidence, especially where population wide mandates  are concerned.\n\nWe could be confident, for instance, that pre-release safety review  of vaccines, like those of drugs, would continue to be designed to satisfy regulators rather than to survive exposure during litigation.  And where there are billions of dollars to be made, out-and-out fraud is hardly unlikely.\n\n[SOURCE](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Conscience-Anarchist-Good-Bye-State-Society\/dp\/1935942026?SubscriptionId=AKIAI63WS3YGA3Y5U2QA&amp;tag=lrc18-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=1935942026)\n\n[SOURCE](https:\/\/www.lewrockwell.com\/2015\/02\/gary-chartier\/no-forced-vaccinations\/)\n\n[SOURCE](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Anarchy-Legal-Order-Politics-Stateless\/dp\/1107661617?SubscriptionId=AKIAI63WS3YGA3Y5U2QA&amp;tag=lrc18-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=1107661617)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Government always want more power.

In fact, I think around 99.98% of the population should be vaccinated.  However, I have pragmatic reasons for not allowing such a program. For starters, even the most rigorous testing cannot determine how a drug might react in certain populations over a long period of time. It might appear in clinical trials that the drug does exactly what it was intended, but given a few years of time could have an incredibly negative side-effect or even a horrific immediate side-effect in an extremely small subset of the population. Let's give those with a dormant autoimmune disease for example. I once knew a family that had vaccinated their daughter only to have seizures immediately after vaccination and undergo an autoimmune attack a couple of months later. The child was vaccinated with the MMR Vaccine and it was determined the vaccine had triggered [Guillain-Barre Syndrome and the seizure, as outlined in this insert.](https:\/\/www.fda.gov\/downloads\/BiologicsBloodVaccines\/UCM123789.pdf) [There was also evidence of vaccine-triggered Narcolepsy in Finland After a Vaccine Trial.](https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/vaccinesafety\/concerns\/history\/narcolepsy-flu.html) Secondly, it ensures that a vaccine company receives a government monopoly. If everyone is forced to get X vaccine, then a company would be able to charge whatever they wanted for the drug without improving its quality. A vaccine could've came out that had a better side-effect profile than the one that was mandated, and at a cheaper price, but said policy could prevent such innovation. Finally, it could lead to an Orwellian nightmare. Paint me paranoid, but I don't trust a government-mandated injection. If the government had wanted to sterilize a large portion of the population by force, it could include a sterilizing agent along with an inoculation. Vaccines most definitely help and save many more lives than they harm, and the hysteria about them is absurd. However, using force is generally not a good option. What you could do is charge parents if not vaccinating their children leads to the harm of either their child or another child. Of course, an exemption to this could be made if something contraindicates the child receiving a vaccine, such as a family or previous history of autoimmune disease.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why I Don't Agree With Forced Vaccination Programs"}

In terms of private ownership of land, such ownership would prevent a lot of pollution. In the case of logging, it's more profitable to log some trees but not all of them. In the case of dumping waste into water, you can force a company to clean up their mess. You can also force them to buy out all areas they could pollute in an area, and by doing that, water pollution would only extend to their property. In the case of where it ran off to other places, the company could be prosecuted. The private property defense of the environment works in almost every case to me - except Air Pollution. After all, greenhouse gas emissions cause a majority of the climate mess we have. Even worse so, it's hard to trace a polluter if several companies release emissions at once. What is the government's role in solving air pollution? Before that, I'd like to point out solutions I already think won't work. I would prefer answers that were not any of the ones below:\n\nCarbon Tax: This would pass price of pollutants down to consumers by raising the prices of a polluter's goods. This would incentivize people to buy off of sources like China, one of the world's biggest polluters. This incentivizes their behavior, causing even worse damage while hindering our economy. You could use the Carbon Tax to give a monthly rebate check to consumers, but I can almost guarantee a large amount would never make it due to government corruption and irresponsibility. This would likely increase the cost of living and extremely hurt the poor.\n\nPrivate Property Defense: Would only work if a company released zero emissions, otherwise they'd be constantly fined. This passes off costs in the situation of the Carbon Tax.\n\nBuying the Right to Pollute: Basically does nothing to solve our problem. Big spenders would be more than happy to purchase these rights. It'd also hurt small businesses, as they wouldn't be able to pay the costs, potentially creating a big business monopoly of sorts.\n\nSubsidizing Green Energy: Leads to incentivization of poor energy solutions while driving up the cost of living. A perfect example of this is in the case of wind energy.\n\nCortez Plan (Forcing transition to green energy and banning of all fossil fuels over time): This one would send several corporations out of business, extremely hurting the economy and even throwing it into a full economic failure.\n\nIf you can prove to me how any of the above would work, I'm also all ears.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"What are some Libertarian Solutions to Air Pollution?"}

However perfect competition is the market system that most of the \"free market\" libertarians quote the basics of without understanding the caveats.\n\n A free market merely means unrestricted competition, or there is no central power prohibiting the entrance and exit to a market [[1]](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/terms\/f\/freemarket.asp). This means that companies can lie, cheat, apply any anti-competitive behaviors they deem necessary so long as it does not violate the non-aggression principle. This is still a free market, in fact businesses can become monopolies or examples of monopolistic competition if the average consumer thinks it's beneficial for them (eg cheaper prices) so long as no central power takes authoritative action.\n\nMost often I hear replies about the market correcting itself through choosing to fund competitors if the market ever becomes anti-competitive. But in order for this to occur perfect information would have to be had by the consumers and new firms would have to be able to be launched easily.\n\nThese two arguments made above for how libertarian societies will be more free made me think that perhaps by free market, libertarians typically mean perfectly competitive market. However, if that is true, there are a large number of requirements in order to maintain this type of market [[2]] (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Perfect_competition). \n\n* A large number of buyers and sellers \u2013 A large number of consumers with the willingness and ability to buy the product at a certain price, and a large number of producers with the willingness and ability to supply the product at a certain price.\n\n* Perfect information \u2013 All consumers and producers know all prices of products and utilities each person would get from owning each product.\n\n* Homogeneous products \u2013 The products are perfect substitutes for each other, (i.e., the qualities and characteristics of a market good or service do not vary between different suppliers).\n\n* Well defined property rights \u2013 These determine what may be sold, as well as what rights are conferred on the buyer.\n\n* No barriers to entry or exit - ***My note: This also means market barriers to entry such as high upfront capital costs***\n\n* Every participant is a price taker \u2013 No participant with market power to set prices\n\n* Perfect factor mobility \u2013 In the long run factors of production are perfectly mobile, allowing free long term adjustments to changing market conditions.\n\n* Profit maximization of sellers \u2013 Firms sell where the most profit is generated, where marginal costs meet marginal revenue.\n\n* Rational buyers: Buyers make all trades that increase their economic utility and make no trades that do not increase their utility.\n\n* No externalities \u2013 Costs or benefits of an activity do not affect third parties. This criteria also excludes any government intervention.\n\n* Zero transaction costs \u2013 Buyers and sellers do not incur costs in making an exchange of goods in a perfectly competitive market.\n\n* Non-increasing returns to scale and no network effects \u2013 The lack of economies of scale or network effects ensures that there will always be a sufficient number of firms in the industry.\n\n* Anti-competitive regulation - It is assumed that a market of perfect competition shall provide the regulations and protections implicit in the control of and elimination of anti-competitive activity in the market place.\n\nIf by a free market libertarians do mean a perfectly competitive market, what insurances does the libertarian system make to ensure that these requirements stay in place? Or do libertarians typically mean by a free market \"imperfect competition\" and if so why are most arguments rebutted with claims that are valid only under perfectly competitive system?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Do Libertarians mistake a free market with no regulations for a perfectly competitive market?"}

I am an environmentalist, a real environmentalist, not a fake leftist one who is just virtue signalling, so let me state my beliefs and actions, and so can you in the comment section.\n\n* Me and my wife both eat only and prefer bio food. Bio food is healthy natural, so we don't like all kinds of pesticides and other toxic chemicals that they put in the food supply, which is obviously harmful for both the planet and human health. I am not a vegetarian, my wife is, so that is a bit of a weak point, but sorry, I just can't give up on a juicy steak, but I don't eat processed meat which is also bad for the environment, and I don't like industrial farming which is also unhealthy.\n\n* I don't produce excessive trash. Since I eat bio food and rarely eat snacks, I don't contribute to the plastic pollution (I don't even use straws lol), like from plastic chip bags or eating fast food garbage wrapped in plastic container and whatnot. The beer that I drink only from glass bottle, I don't drink canned stuff it can be tainted by poisonous metals, glass is healthier. So I don't pollule, I don't throw trash on the ground, and I (or actually my wife) keep our garden very tidy and green. And neither does my wife and the people I know if that matters.\n\n* I don't waste water. Sorry we have a car, so it has to be washed, I also have to be hygienic so I shower every day or 2 days, and wash my hands before every eating. But it's not like I keep my fauced open and just let the water go to waste. On top of that the water is heavily taxed here, so I pay the fair market price over the top, it's not like I don't deserve the water I use.\n\n* We are in contact with a green firm to install solar panels on our roof, have been shopping around for a while and we decided to switch to green energy. It's kind of hard from a regulatory point of view, a lot of paperwork with the utility bureaucrats but it's possible here in Europe, and it may even be cheaper since the electricity is taxed too. Also good to become self-sustainable and not depend on government electricity. So everyone that lives in a house should probably do this, it can save you on the bills in the long term, but it may have a 10-15 year amortization cost.\n\n* I have an older car I have to admit, but that is just because these new green cars look ridiculous, not a good family car and it doesn't have a big trunk to put shopping items in, so I'll pass on that until some better cars come out. I also don't like this smart shit that they put in cars where they can remote hack your smart car, so I will avoid that for a while until it gets sorted out.\n\n* Most house utilities that we have are rated A or A+ by the EU electricity authorities , so they are very efficient. \n\n* I try to avoid to use a much paper as possible, haven't even bought a notebook lately whereas I used to keep my notes in a notebook, lately I keep it all on computer, it's just much more efficient that way, and I don't lose them. Unfortunately the government bureau rats are the ones that use massive amounts of paper each year, and even though they started transitioning to digital stuff, this whole [EU Digital Market](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Digital_Single_Market) directive which can turn into an Orwellian system, but the regulations have also expanded so even thought they keep a lot of databases online, they still do a lot of paperwork, whereas I try to avoid paper as much as possible. Just with the GDPR alone now you have to fill out a paper form at every store agreeing to data collection, what an ecological disaster.\n\n* I don't consent to war which creates gigantic amounts of pollution.\n\n* I don't consent to taxation and fractional reserve banking, which creates a consumerist wasteful economy that is extreme on pollution, instead I would like to see an economy with people having more capital and less gadgets, which is what matters on the long run. Just think about it, buying a damn phone every year knowing that in 10 years it's price will lose 90% of it's value, what a fucking waste of capital and resources.\n\n* By the way I don't buy stupid gadgets, I am a minimalist, I don't even own a smart phone, nor any other smart crap. I'd rather own cryptocurrencies or hard assets like land and precious metals.\n\n* I think we are probably better off with green energy, it seems clean and more efficient, but we should not discount the current infrastructure either, so we probably need to transition very slowly to green alternatives, to not mess up the economy. \n\n* I don't believe in the Global Warming Hoax, I think it's a UN\/Chinese scam of global wealth redistribution. Charts like [this](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:2000_Year_Temperature_Comparison.png) shown by these swindlers is totally phony when looking at [the big picture](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/File:All_palaeotemps.svg), as you can see it's just a minor blip in the big picture and it's just a reversal to the mean. However all climate change charlatans advocate for a global carbon tax and a global carbon credit market, which banksters are drooling over, more toxic derivatives that they can play with, and some even advocated for a tax that is redistributed to families, talking about peak socialism here, not to mention increased foreign aid to Africa which will end up in the Swiss bank account of african dictators. It's basically just a globalist bankster scam like the credit-default-swaps, this is their latest invention. Also notice that big oil companies are not against climate regulation, they are all for it, because it would monopolize them, in some cases they make up the panelists in the climate change institutions like [Hoesung Lee](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hoesung_Lee) the head of [IPCC](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change) who previously worked for ExxonMobil, what a damn weird coincidence??? Talking about crony regulation. Global Warming is the 21 century's biggest SCAM, compared to fractional reserve banking which is the 20th century's one. And the dumb people swallow it.\n\n--------------\n\nI am a real environmentalist and I want to see an ecologically friendly society, but that won't happen with endorsing massive scams.","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"Real Environmentalism""num_comments":10,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Real Environmentalism"}

{"author":"CommunismDoesntWork","created_utc":1532968455,"num_comments":6,"score":6,"selftext":"TL;DR: Any ideology based on banning private property is dead thanks to cryptographically-enforced private property.\n\nCryptocurrencies, Smart Contracts(sometimes called dApps), and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations(DAOs) each represents three different forms of unbannable private property. What is private property? Our definition of private property is straightforward; it's any piece of property that the government doesn't own. But even if we go by the left's irrelevant definition, we will see that each of these 3 technologies meets their definition of private property. And since each of these technologies are inherently unbannable, one can only conclude that the far left is ideologically dead.\n\nSo how does the far left define private property? Here are a few excerpts from a few different leftists:\n\n[\u201dWe are opposed to the kind of \\[private\\] property \u201cwhich can be used only to exploit people \u2014 land and buildings, instruments of production and distribution, raw materials and manufactured articles, money and capital.\u201d \\[Nicholas Walter, About Anarchism, p. 40\\]](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/the-anarchist-faq-editorial-collective-an-anarchist-faq-03-17#toc17)\n\n[\"If your mom made a living off fixing neighbors clothes, and accepted money for it, then \\[the sewing machine\\] would be considered private property. If she employs people and takes part of the revenue for the work done by employees, that shit's getting seized.\"](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/communism101\/comments\/6zgp2s\/personal_property_vs_private_property\/dmv9m3z\/) Here we see how communists define private property. If you use property to make money, it's private property. And if you make money using your private property while hiring others, that's doubly offensive.\n\nHere are some others on money in particular:\n\n[\"Yes, communism seeks to abolish money, but nobody knows how a moneyless post-capitalist system would run.\"](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DebateCommunism\/comments\/85o77b\/does_communism_seek_to_abolish_money\/)\n\n[\"\\[Money\\] needs to be abolished there is no way to have money and not have material individualism.\"](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/comments\/3ob4ws\/how_do_anarchists_feel_about_money_as_a_concept\/cvvx1wq\/)\n\n[\"Abolish Money!\"](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/shusui-kotoku-abolish-money) This one is particularly interesting becuase leftist-anarchists like to claim that anarcho-capitalists aren't real anarchists because 100 years ago the 'original' anarchists were anti-capitalists. At the same time, some modern anarchists say that money is fine, and doesn't need to be abolished(likely because they realized Bitcoin killed their entire ideology overnight). When debating these fools, send them to this article, and be sure to tell them to check the date it was published(1900).\n\nSo now let's go one by one and use technology to destroy the far left's horrific hopes and dreams.\n\n#Money\n\nMoney is the obvious one. Cryptocurrencies are [unbannable](https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/computing\/dont-worry-about-bitcoin-regulation-it-cant-be-stopped\/) forms of money. Their inherent decentralized structure means that not even china, who has complete control of their nations internet, could ban it. The weakest link in crypto space are the centralized exchanges. However, thanks to mining and stores that accept CCs like SilkRoad and [OpenBazaar](https:\/\/openbazaar.org\/), it's possible to acquire CCs and spend them without going through a centralized exchange. Not to mention, decentralized exchanges will be a thing one day.\n\n#Property that you use to earn money\n\nThis one is solved by boths Smart Contracts and DAOs, but I'm going to focus on Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts are awesome. If you haven't read my article on them, check out what I wrote [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GoldandBlack\/comments\/7pqkpb\/ethereums_smart_contracts_are_the_most_ancap\/). They [can compute anything that a normal program can](https:\/\/ethereum.stackexchange.com\/questions\/2464\/what-does-it-mean-that-ethereum-is-turing-complete), but are also unbannable thanks to being decentralized. For our purposes, we can think of Smart Contracts as unbannable programs. Programs are property. Even [open source programs are property](https:\/\/www.linuxtoday.com\/infrastructure\/2001051601220op). When a programer creates a program, they have the freedom to open source the code or not because they own their code(assuming they haven't agreed to give up ownership of the code in exchange for something else). If they do decide to open source their code, they also have the freedom to attach a license(any license) onto their code or not- because they own their code. It's their property. In fact, software in general can be thought of as just digital factories- it takes in inputs, and spits out some outputs. And like physical factories, someone owns them. So we've established programs and code are property. *But is it private property?* Going by the leftist definitions, yes, it can be. \n\nTake [CryptoKitties](https:\/\/www.cryptokitties.co\/) for instance. CryptoKitties is a SmartContract that lives on the Ethereum blockchain. The idea is you can trade and breed these digital cats with other users, while the company earns a fixed percentage of each trade. CryptoKitties was in fact created by an entrepreneur who hired people to help him make the product. His employees probably get paid a salary, while his company gets paid directly through the SmartContract. In fact, we can see the exact addresses that CryptoKities sends its revenue to, along with who has control over which parts of the Smart Contract: https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d#code\nThe \"contract KittyAccessControl\" is particularly interesting. CryptoKitties was made by a team, but you could imagine if it was made by a single person. There's nothing really stopping a single person from making CKs. Either way, CKs is property that is owned by an individual or a few individuals, and is used to make a profit. And it's unbannable. The revenue from CKs will always go to the owner of the contract. That makes CKs an unbannable form of private property by their own definition. \n\n#Instruments\/Tools\/Means of production\n\nBut what about the physical computers and keyboards that the programmers use to create the unbannable programs? Couldn't those at least be seized? Nope. That's where DAOs come in. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations mother fucker. DAOs are a beast. Imagine a company with no headquarters, and no one knows who the owners or employees are, or where they're located. DAOs are built on top of Smart Contracts, but instead of a cute game like CryptoKitties, they allow an entrepreneur to codify a business structure in such a way that anyone can perform a task and get paid for it in a completely decentralized fashion. In such a business, it would be impossible to \"seize the means of production\". Even if the government tracked down one employee and stole their computer, the DAO would still automatically find a new employee to do work, potentially in a completely separate country. And even if the government tracked down the owner of the DAO, the DAO itself still might not be seizeable, assuming the owner stores their private keys in their head. Think of the Uber business model, but on steroids. Or think 'working from home' taken to the extreme. [Here's a good article on DAOs](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/future-work-jack-du-rose\/). Uber by itself actually is very interesting. Uber doesn't own any cars, the drivers own their own car. However, the Uber App isn't on the blockchain, so technically it could be banned or seized. However, if Uber were a DAO, it would become an unbannable form of private property.\n\nFar leftists would point out that DAOs also enable \"woker owned businesses\", which is true. A DAO could be programmed to fit any sort of business structure. Unfortunately for them, capitalism doesn't care at all what individuals do, as long as they don't steal or damage other people's private property, or break a contract that they agreed to. Worker co-ops like [Mondragon Corporation](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mondragon_Corporation) are as capitalist as Chicken McNuggets. Far leftists on the other hand don't extend this same level of freedom to us, which is why their ideologies are predicated on violence. In order for them to succeed, private property must be completely banned, and their very specific business model must be enforced at gunpoint. Luckily for us, we have cryptography and economics on our side. They may be able to ban certain forms of physical private property like apartments(although even that could be solved by an AirBnB Smart Contract), but they will never be able to ban all of it, or even a fraction of it. Other far leftists such as left-anarchists believe that if we get rid of the government, private property won't be enforceable, and will just automatically disappear. They believe a government is required for private property enforcement. They're completely wrong. Cryptographically-enforced private property is here to stay. They can scream and shout exploitation all they want, but their ideology is completely and utterly unenforceable, and is thus effectively dead. Good riddens.\n\n# In conclusion\n\n* Any ideology predicated on completely banning private property is dead\n\n* Any ideology predicated on the idea that private property will disappear if the government does as well is dead.\n\nIf you like this post and want to explore this topic further, feel free to sub and post to \/r\/AnarchoCryptography.

Some Libertarians are seeking radical change toward the cause of freedom, and view any compromise as being betrayal. Some Libertarians prefer a slower approach to change, with a steady aim at freedom while attempting to curb unintended consequences.\n\nI personally fall in the second category, which would put me in line with men like Ben Shapiro and Rand Paul, both who seem to be villianized by the hardline\/liberal end of the Libertarian spectrum.\n\nRegardless of which outlook is taken by the party as a whole, we will not be taken seriously until we can actually organize a common ground on how change should be implemented.\nI would suggest that slow change is more stable and lasting, but that is only my mere opinion.\n\n1.

Is this a balanced opinion, well thought out that considers more possibilities?\"\n\nI feel like I see a lot of opinions on this subreddit that have made it hard for me to solidify my identity as Libertarian. See, when people like Bill Weld or Gary Johnson talk about issues, I generally agree with most of what they say.\n\nBut when I come here? I see people worrying about the existence of maternity leave as if it's some major issue, as if women don't get the short end of the stick with that. I mean, excessive maternity leave isn't so great, but women will have no ability to compete with men if they wish to have a family. It'll set us back in terms of equity.\n\nIt's not really a *sane* opinion that we should eliminate programs that tell companies to offer maternity leave, because they'll go away, and quickly. What *else* isn't sane is to categorize people who think that it's perfectly okay to offer maternity leave with the far left people who think that you should have to call people by their proper gender pronouns.\n\nI'm sorry, but this just isn't sane. There might be some manipulation of this sub's votes going on, since a post about Gary Johnson running for Senate in New Mexico got about a quarter of the votes as a post by someone who has posted pro-socialist stuff who just happened to be promoting something that is meant to create more divisiveness over gender.\n\nThis might be a divide and conquer strategy by people who mean us harm. So, try to foster sane opinions, because there is no shortage of insane ones out there. \n\nAlso... I notice that a lot of laissez-faire discussion focuses on cutting taxes for the wealthy exclusively. Like, you don't have to agree with that, but *why is reducing taxes on people who already have a shitload of money a priority?* To me that sounds kind of foolish, like you're gullible if you're ultra worried about that. I'm not saying it *shouldn't* be lowered either, but there are *far* *more* important things to worry about.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"A Litmus Test"}

Many young couples may more to live in neighborhoods that have better school options.\n\nClearly there is a line in which government pays too much for public education leading to diminished returns.

I\u2019ve seen plenty of organizations linked to the local opposition spouting out numbers though.\n\nVenezuelans are hungry in good part because capitalists in the country are intentionally trying to starve them by withholding food in order to provoke an uprising, as they have done numerous times in recent history, for example, before the 2014 elections and in the year of the 2002 and 2002\/3 attempted coups. After decades of neoliberalism, Latin American countries\u2019 food systems are dominated by often a single massive multinational which creates, imports or distributes most of the food. For instance, the company Polar dominates the food market, controlling [over half the flour](https:\/\/monthlyreview.org\/2018\/06\/01\/the-politics-of-food-in-venezuela\/) controls over half the flour in the country (the staple) and also owns a network of supermarkets.\n\nSecondly, Venezuela is also suffering because of the US sanctions, which the UN General Assembly condemned, noting they were deliberately designed to [\u201cdisproportionately affect the poor and the most vulnerable classes\u201d]( http:\/\/undocs.org\/A\/HRC\/37\/L.34) , calling on all states not to recognize them and began discussing reparations that the US must pay to Venezuela. None of this has been reported anywhere in the US media; I have checked.\n\nThe Venezuelan people, unlike us, of course, know all this, and that\u2019s why even during this period the government\u2019s popularity has *gone up* and they convincingly won the recent election. Of course, none of this is to say that the government is good or doing well. I'm actually highly critical of where the government has gone. But if we actually care about facts and context and discussion, this stuff needs to be known, otherwise we are completely ignorant of the situation.\n\nThese are not the only reasons why the economy is bad, [you can read a longer explanation here]( https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/socialism\/comments\/8kbzir\/ive_just_written_a_book_about_the_media_and\/dz6fcfl\/?context=3).\n\n\n\nFinally, if this is proof socialism failed, then Ecuador must be proof that socialism works, as under the socialist president Correa, unemployment fell to a record low of [4%, poverty fell by 27%](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2013\/feb\/15\/rafael-correa-ecuador-elections) in 7 years all while beginning to bring in [universal free education and healthcare](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/cifamerica\/2012\/jan\/19\/ecuador-radical-exciting-place) and reducing its debt. Of course, none of this is ever brought up by these people because they don\u2019t want an honest discussion about \u201csocialism\u201d and they don\u2019t want people knowing about these countries.\n\nSo a response in 140 characters would be Venezuelans are hungry because big capitalists in the country are intentionally trying to starve them and because of illegal US sanctions. This certainly doesn\u2019t tell the whole story but is a quick comeback.\n\nOh yeah, and if you are interested in the book but balk at the price, DM me your email address and I could send you a copy of my PhD which is pretty similar to the book.","subreddit":"ChapoTrapHouse","title":"A response to the classic \"what about Venezuela?\"""num_comments":1,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"A response to the classic \"what about Venezuela?\""}

I also think most can agree that the deep state is one of the biggest problems facing the U.S right now. Obviously voting Democrat and voting Republican obviously will do nothing, but I also don't see how a libertarian government would fix it. Campaign donations and lobbying is one of the biggest reasons why the deep state exists and libertarianism would do nothing to stop that, it would just make it worse by lifting any regulations that are currently in place to limit the amount of money an individual or a corporation can give to a candidate. I understand there would be \"100% transparency\", but still. The increase in power that corporations can have is something that would inherently come from a libertarian government, and obviously that would further enhance the plutocracy.\n\nAm I missing something?
