I saw a lot of that this past year. To put it simply: Anarchy = no government, while Libertarian = smaller government. I hope you can find some time in 2018 to familiarize yourself with what Libertarianism truly is because I honestly believe everyone is Libertarian, they just don't know it yet. Now on to the list!\n\n1. [Despite Trump backing out of the Paris Agreement, some US States vowed to uphold the agreement.](http://www.businessinsider.com/us-states-uphold-paris-agreement-2017-6) We don't need the federal government's permission to do what's right for the environment. We have the power individually to help combat climate change. Plus, this is a prime example of giving the power back to the states. We should have very few nationwide blanket policies because what's good for New York may not be what's good for California. \n\n2. [Gamers finally vote with their wallets by boycotting EA and Battlefront 2.](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-star-wars-battlefront-economics-20171123-story.html) See, we didn't need more regulations and we don't need the government to step in to say that lootboxes are gambling. We changed a billion dollar business with our wallets. Sure, they'll try to go back to their old ways but if we stay strong they'll finally get the message: we will not be nickeled and dimed. Here's to playing better games in the future by making sacrifices now!\n\n3. [After Trump fails to send the proper help and supplies to Puerto Rico, private citizens pick up the slack for the relief effort.](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/28/mark-cuban-and-pitbull-lend-private-planes-to-puerto-rico.html) I was debating whether I should put this on here or not because this *is* what a government is actually supposed to be there for but it just further shows that if the government isn't there for us we can still get through a tough situation. We are good, strong, and smart enough to make a difference as individual private citizens.\n\nWhat are other examples? And happy new year!

Back in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s I learned race has no bearing on character. For about 20 years, I lived my life that way, making a conscious effort to not respect any race (and that morphed to group) over another.   Some people started respecting some races and group above others. It made some sense because these groups had been abused and marginalized for so many years.\n \nIn the late 90\u2019s some people started stereotyping by race again, they stereotyped one race as privileged. The more authoritative ones told all members of that race that they had this privilege and if any objected they were called racist or bigot.\n  \nMeanwhile income inequality had been growing steadily and the poor of all races got poorer. At a time when all the low income people needed to come together it seemed they were more divided than ever. Social justice is a something to be strived after but like all vigilante efforts in can get out of hand. When hate and intolerance start to lead a movement reason can easily be left behind.\n \nMany poor white Americans were annoyed at being stereotyped. A few of the more ignorant ones could be deluded into believing themselves \u201csupreme\u201d over other races or groups. Donald Trump knows how to use hate, intolerance and controversy. Trump played the media like a virtuoso; he\u2019d make an outrageous statement that had a kernel of truth to it. The liberal leaning media, would jump all over it and be almost as outrageous back, often denying the kernel of truth. Of course the conservative leaning media would push back and a fake news fight ensued. Sadly both sides believed their own press and doubled down. Then things got \u201cnasty and deplorable\u201d\u2026.and then got bad. Surprisingly, a \u201cgiant douche and a turd sandwich\u201d, gets record low voter participation.\n\nWe now have the unthinkable a Pres. Trump. I\u2019m a little annoyed; some of you social justice warriors may wonder why I\u2019m busting your chops here? I\u2019m used to conservatives being dicks but liberals are supposed to be the tolerant ones. Many Republicans will see Pres, Trump for the authoritarian that he is and recognize the path they\u2019re one. \n\nBUTT many Democrats are still full of hate. Hillary recognized her mistake and apologized for calling Republicans \u201cdeplorable\u201d. So many social justice warriors are still angry and want vengeance. They still call Republicans racist, bigot, homophobe\u2026while overlooking their own intolerance.  The sharper ones should start to see a pattern, the more intolerance, the better Trump can operate. Do you really need hate, intolerance and rhetoric to defeat Trump\u2019s logic? Facts and logic are cold and resolute. Rhetoric is hot and emotional. \n  \nSo what do we do now?  As an Independent who has never voted for a sitting president, I\u2019ll do what I\u2019ve always done;\n\u201cIn questions of power, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution.\u201d Thomas Jefferson\n\nDo I expect you to lie down?

From what I understand, when the automobile was a relatively new technology, the US was home to a huge number of auto companies, most of which have been purchased or driven out of business, until we are left with just a few (GM, Ford, etc). I heard recently that a similar thing happened with ISP's, and now we are left with just a few (Comcast, Time Warner, etc).\n\nI have seen in this subreddit people mention that a big reason the ISP market belongs to so few companies is because of government interference within that market, and acting in a way that chooses favorites or something to a similar effect. I was just curious if anyone was aware of similar things happening with the auto industry back in the day, and also what some proposed solutions might be. More competition within the market is better, but it seems like companies are often times able to completely decimate their competition and accumulate huge amounts of capital and power, then use that to squash their competition. I love the free market as much as the next guy, but this seems to be a recurring problem. If anyone is able to shed some light on this or simply express some constructive thoughts, I would be very appreciative.\n\nThis is what I was referring to as the auto industry bit. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_automobile_manufacturers_of_the_United_States\n\nIt says there were over 1800 auto manufacturers in the US from 1894 to 1930, and obviously there are far fewer today.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Curious about businesses conglomerating"}

You can read all about it if you type dot com at the end of my username. \n\nAnyways, I tend to vote \"L\" whenever possible, from local elections all the way up to national. The LP point of view on 2A closely mirrors my own, so it kind of works out. \n\nWhen the rubber meets the road though, I notice that the LP at most levels tends to back-burner 2A. My personal opinion is that this is kind of a mistake, since if the LP actively courted gun owners, it would swell their ranks enormously. On social media, once in awhile, you'll see a \"rah rah rah 2A!\" post from the big LP orgs, but it's usually very circumspect. \n\nIt's actually why I like Austin Petersen - he's \"out and proud\" about guns. \n\nAs far as points of view though, I do notice that sometimes bringing up 2A in a Libertarian context gives a lot people pause. I understand guns are a contentious issue in this country, and coming out of the gate to recruit people to Libertarianism by advertising \"Hey, we want to deregulate machine guns!\" isn't the wisest approach.

{"author":"rigbed","created_utc":1515123994,"num_comments":4,"score":0,"selftext":"&gt;It's called \"political economy\" for a reason. The relationship between the individual, the state and property is central to most every ideology, whether political or economic, and the state ends up enforcing the economic terms of the political system. \n\nO come on now, don't be wilfully obtuse\u2014we both know that most conservatives don't know what socialism actually is and have been brought up and indoctrinated to believe that communism inherently  means totalitarianism and dictatorships and mass killings. That's their main\u2014and oftentimes sole\u2014argument against communism. I can 9 times out of 10 already come up with their clich\u00e9 responses before they even type a word. Then it turns to \"Well if communism/socialism is so good then why hasn't it ever been achieved yada yada yada\". Then I have to ask them how long capitalism has been around and then ask them how long communism/socialism has been around? One is old and one is like a newborn baby in the modern world. Then they throw up a wall and can't compute that. Then I tell them to research the history of the US and the CIA toppling socialist nations in the 1900s and pushing coups of democratically elected socialists while propping fascist dictatorships and then they throw up another wall.\n\nWhy hasn't a socialist nation progressed? Ask Vietnam, for example, why millions died at the hands of the US? Because the US didn't want another communist/socialist country in southeast Asia so instead of letting Vietnam govern itself and elect who they wanted to capitalist United States had to attempt to bomb the communism out of Vietnam.\n\nWhy hasn't a socialist nation progressed? The world market is dominated by capitalism and is enforced by US imperialism. The US has went to war, bombed innocents, murdered countless millions, incited coups and more in the face of free people choosing a communist/socialist system. The US is the head honcho of capitalist nations and can produce economic sanctions against almost any nation it deems an enemy and eventually crush it.\n\nWhy indeed.\n\n&gt;If the economic system demands stripping individuals of their property by force, why would you not blame the government of such a state for political abuses in pursuit of those economic aims?\n\nWhat personal property? Workplaces and businesses where the masses are taken advantage of and exploited by the few for the amassment of riches for those few? Or are you under the wrong assumption that socialism advocates the stripping away of personal property like homes and cars and what an individual owns? You couldn't believe that because if you did then that would just show that you are devoid of the very basics of socialism.\n\n&gt;That's not in dispute, at least by me, but it's a straw man argument.\n\nYes, it is in dispute because the very same uneducated lot who tie communism/socialism to mass killings and mayhem can't see the same thing in capitalism. It's the literal basis for the start of every single argument with an uneducated conservative who decries communism/socialism.\n\n\n&gt;No one claimed capitalism was free of abuses.\n\nYou haven't been paying attention.\n\n\n&gt;The claim isn't that socialism and communism theoreticians advocate for the use of mass murder and tyranny to implement their systems.\n\nYes, it is. Again, you haven't been paying attention.\n\n&gt;The claim is that the implementation of these systems is prone to producing authoritarian governments who systematically oppress their populations in pursuit of their goals.\n\nAs are capitalist nations, as are any nations. The difference is is that capitalism inherently relies on mass exploitation to achieve its end goal and is setup in such a way that eventually the rich, who are the few, will get richer and richer, while the masses, the many, get poorer and poorer. Socialism isn't inherently about exploitation but democracy in the workplace and rights and protections\u2014the same rights and protections people have used to attempt to humanize capitalism with, which are social security, healthcare, labor rights, a minimum wage, ect.\n\n\n&gt;There is no true socialist system. In fact, you're committing something of a fallacy by claiming there is one.\n\nOkay, you can't even discern the difference between a hypothetical and me claiming that there are true socialist nations today. This convo has gotten tedious.\n\n&gt;But that aside, I would argue that if socialism was actually a superior economic system to capitalism, then it would have no problem competing with capitalism. In fact, it's better treated workforce would in fact out produce the capitalists and enjoy higher standards of living and greater material prosperity. \n\nI already answered this above.\n\n&gt;The world would be rushing to adopt socialism not for its ideological goals but for the practical fact that it delivered thriving economies where needs and wants were met with ease. \n\nThat's what typically happens when the masses have been brainwashed to love their exploitation and defend it at all costs. That's what happens when the masses have been brainwashed instead of being taught about what socialism actually is by picking up a book. The rich and elite and the politicians they control love capitalism because it allows them to stay rich and powerful while the masses are exploited for profit. It's ingenious, really. Brainwash young minds to think that capitalism is synonymous with freedom and democracy and that anyone that wants to democratize the workplace\u2014even via labor unions\u2014is a dirty commie. You bathe them in faux patriotism and send them off to die in wars for \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" while the rich profit off the destruction.

First of all, it seems to be based on the idea of space being the province of all mankind\u2014at first that may sound good, as it means there isn't any powerful governmental organization making the ridiculous claim that they own all of space. But it breaks down pretty quickly\u2014if all of space is owned by all mankind equally, what about private property? If I had the means to get to another planet, shouldn't I be able to stake a claim on some land there, just like how the first civilizations were founded on Earth? Why shouldn't I have the same freedom to own and control my own private property just because that property happens to be located somewhere other than Earth?\n\nHere's all the principles that page lists and why they're wrong:\n\n&gt; The exploration and use of outer space shall be carried on for the benefit and in the interests of all mankind;\n\nSo I can use my private property on Earth solely for my own benefit if I want, but somehow as soon as I leave Earth, I'm suddenly only allowed to do things for the benefit of everyone back there? Besides the absurdity of saying people somehow only have a right to private property on one planet out of the whole universe, there's a couple other things wrong with this. First, what sense does it make that I'd be *more* liable to the rest of mankind because I'm *further* from them? Also, what if I'm going to space because I don't want to consider myself among the rest of mankind, or because I want a place to enjoy the individual freedom I'm entitled to without anyone else in the way? I know in practice it wouldn't necessarily be worth the trouble for people on Earth to fly out to space and bring me back by force for doing something they don't like, but simply the fact that they're implying they have the right to, and that everyone seems to be okay with that, bothers me.\n\nAnd what about alien races? I doubt Earth-based government organizations are claiming any and all alien races that may exist must answer to the people of Earth. That would be even more ridiculous. But if I leave Earth, why shouldn't I enjoy the same self-sovereignty they enjoy? Just because I *originated* on Earth means I must remain forever associated with the people there? It's not like I chose Earth and agreed to that.\n\n&gt; Outer space and celestial bodies are free for exploration and use by all States;\n\nWhat about individuals? This seems to imply they're treating states as the only primary agents, with individuals not really having any freedom except as allowed to them by the state. Nope, you got that backwards. You may point out they never said individuals don't have that freedom as well, but judging by the rest of it, I'm pretty sure they just mean states.\n\n&gt; Outer space and celestial bodies are not subject to national appropriation;\n\nIf a country that isn't a party to this agreement were to travel to another planet and start a community there, why wouldn't it be part of that country if it would on Earth? What if I wanted to start my *own* country on another planet, just as people have done on Earth? Why shouldn't I be able to do that, where there's actually unclaimed land to do so?\n\n&gt; No Weapons of Mass Destruction are permitted in outer space;\n\nSounds like a good idea at first, but remember, on the scale of outer space, those weapons are much less destructive. Why shouldn't I be able to detonate a nuclear bomb on another planet if I want, where there wouldn't be any damage to person or property? Why are countries allowed to test nuclear weapons underground on the planet currently occupied by humans, and not safely on unoccupied planets?\n\n&gt; The Moon and other celestial bodies shall be used exclusively for peaceful purposes;\n\nOkay, so this one seems pretty good at least. War is aggression, and is therefore wrong in space just as it is on Earth. My only complaint would be if they extend this to prohibit using things in space to defend oneself against acts of aggression by others, which I'm not sure if they are.\n\n&gt; The activities of non-governmental entities in outer space shall require the authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State;\n\nThis is one of the craziest ones. If I'm doing something in space, how is my country at all involved? What if I'm going to space because I want to live solely as an individual, *not* subject to the jurisdiction of any state? Where do they expect us to go? No government has any claim on me personally. I don't think much really needs to be said here; we all know how wrong this one is.\n\n&gt; States shall retain jurisdiction and control over their space objects   and any personnel thereon;\n\nThis one *sounds* good\u2014a state, just like an individual, should have control over their own property, and should be able to make rules concerning the use of their property. (In other words, individuals have rights to their property, and whether or not they collectively call themselves a \"state\" is irrelevant to that.) If that's all it means then that's good. But when they say \"their\" space objects, I wouldn't be surprised if they mean that to include those of their citizens as well. By sending something into space, that doesn't suddenly mean it's any less my property.\n\n&gt; States shall be liable for damage caused by their space objects; and\n\nNot bad, I guess. If a state sends something into space, and it damages someone else's property, I can't think of anyone else who should be liable. But again, if they're extending it to include objects owned by their citizens...well, I can't say I'd *complain* if my country's government agreed to foot the bill for me, but it doesn't make sense for them to be *required* to, or for it to be considered their fault, implying they had say in it. Especially if my country wasn't a party to this agreement.\n\n&gt; States shall avoid the harmful contamination of outer space.\n\nCan't really find fault in this. It does qualify it with \"harmful\" after all.\n\n----\n\nI know it seems like Earth is the center of the universe, and space is just some \"extension\" of Earth accessible from said planet. But it's not. Earth is just one planet in space, currently the only one that happens to be inhabited by humans. And yet, along with its flawed interpretation of rights, space law seems to be written as if Earth \"owns\" the rest of space somehow, regardless of who else may begin or already be living there. Even if that were the case, I don't see why the same property rights wouldn't apply.\n\nYour thoughts? Why isn't there more opposition to this? Hopefully there will be once space travel actually becomes widespread, if these backwards laws aren't fixed by then.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why aren't more people talking about how backwards space law is?"}

First, if schools are privatized what happens to the people who can't afford to send their children to good schools, I know the money theyd gain from not paying taxes would help with the cost, but wouldn't the families who had to send their kids to worse schools because of money put their children at a disadvantage because they couldn't afford better(basically like college right now in the US). Secondly, how would poor areas afford police, fire, and paramedic services? Again, they'd have more money without taxes, but this would create a further divide between classes because the poor people would be less able to pay for the decent services. Thirdly, how would a privatized military work? If the govt would not be in control of the military how would the private military orgs decide on what's considered grounds for action? I mean you could take a national poll, but sometimes there isn't time for a poll. ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Some questions I have"}

I've unfortunately seen a lot of people on this sub defending Sessions, arguing that he's simply following the law and instead calling on Congress to change the law if they don't like it.\n\nI've responded to a few of these comments, so I'm just going to write down my main argument here.\n\nFirst of all, Sessions has the power to deschedule marijuana, so if we want to criticize Congress for their inaction on marijuana, we can also criticize the executive branch. Don't defend Sessions for \"following the law\" when he very well could have changed the law in question.\n\nBut in regards to this \"he's just doing his job\" stuff.... Drug prohibition is an unjust and unconstitutional law that reduces individual liberty. We needed a constitutional amendment to outlaw alcohol, how is drug prohibition constitutional? So shouldn't a \"small government constitutionalist\" like Sessions oppose drug prohibition? Not to mention the inherent moral issue of locking someone in a cage for smoking a plant.\n\nIt is absolutely OK to criticize Sessions for going *out of his way* to enforce an unjust law. Would you have criticized the Northern States for not enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act? Would you have criticized Nazi officials who didn't enforce some of Hitler's policies? I know those are extreme cases, but I believe Thomas Jefferson put it best: \"If a law is unjust, a man is not only right to disobey it, he is obligated to do so.\" ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Response to \"Jeff Sessions is just doing his job\""}

However, these tax cuts only mean anything if they and the rest of the deficit are made up for by cuts to [spending](https://imgur.com/a/iowar). \n\nTrump has [repeatedly](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/12/donald-trump-paul-ryan-medicare-medicaid/) [promised](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/23/15862312/trump-medicaid-promise) that he won't make any cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. He recently [reaffirmed](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/oct/23/trump-says-he-wont-touch-social-security-medicare/) those promises so we know he wasn't just lying to get elected.\n\nHe also supports massive *increases* in military spending, [increases that look likely to take effect](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/18/senate-passes-700-billion-defense-policy-bill-backing-trump-call-for-steep-increase-in-military-spending.html).\n\nIf you look at [total federal spending](https://imgur.com/a/iowar) again, you'll see that **Trump is unwilling to cut over 75% of government spending**. So the problem isn't that Trump cut taxes, it's that he's too much of a populist and a statist to offset those tax cuts. So Trump's unwillingness to cut spending will result in increases to the deficits and ultimately the federal debt. \n\nAnd as we all know from ECON 101, all debt is simply future taxation. So no Trump apologists, I don't oppose Trump for cutting taxes. I oppose him because he opposes spending cuts.\n\nEdit: Grammar","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The problem isn't that Trump cut taxes, the problem is that he's unwilling to cut the vast majority of federal spending"}

Swept DLR 2010 under the rug? [The bunching one too](http://www.sole-jole.org/17722.pdf)? And the one where we [put to bed](http://ftp.iza.org/dp10572.pdf) the whole \"minimum wage workers aren't really from poor families\" thing? I thought you were better than that. But there you are, citing *that* Seattle paper, arguing that it's totally reasonable to estimate the employment effects of minimum wages [just by asking firms in a survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/6r83cg/study_montgomery_would_lose_47000_jobs_by_2022_if/dl31ipi/), slinging around blog posts by best selling textbook authors (not by labor economists!), and then telling weird stories about how really the minimum wage discussion is all about how the marginal propensity to consume varies by income group.   \n\nI'd school y'all on this but my hourly rate ain't 0 for material already in the [r/badeconomics textbook](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/wiki/faq_minwage). (That's right Mankiw, we're coming for you.)\n\nSo instead, let's talk about your reasoning about the minimum wage wouldn't be entirely straight *even if labor markets were perfectly competitive*. \n\nIt seems to me there's this idea floating out there that without monopsony power, the minimum wage is a clear no. Price floors cause unemployment cause the minimum wage to be a bad policy. So [instead we should do the EITC](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/6kusgl/who_actually_benefits_from_a_raise_in_the_minimum/djrkhkv/), which is soooo much better than the minimum wage [that it's an indictment of democracy itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/6kusgl/who_actually_benefits_from_a_raise_in_the_minimum/djpendy/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=neoliberal) that we don't discuss it more. \n\n\nLet's start with the minimum wage and then move to the EITC. The point of the minimum wage, presumably, is to increase the welfare of low wage workers by raising their income. To make them earn more. So, why this sudden big interest in unemployment? So what if people spend a little more time unemployed each year if they earn more overall? You'd have to have some pretty funny elasticities in mind to make a minimum wage hike reduce average earnings, even with unemployment hikes.\n\nNot following? Did you have in mind that one model, that supply and demand cross thing -- the one in 101 textbooks? Yeah, I thought so. That one usually goes wrong in labor markets. I mean, good grief, you can't even guarantee that labor supply curves are upward sloping!\n\nBut the other thing it does is it makes a lot of people think of \"employment\" and \"unemployment\" as static bins that people go into and then stay in. The trouble is, that's just not a good way of thinking about the labor market. When people lose their jobs, they look for new ones. Eventually, they get a new one. Unemployment isn't a bin you stay in forever, becoming the permanent \"loser\" from the new policy -- you can climb your way out of it.\n\nSo, when it comes to the minimum wage, whether or not it increases unemployment isn't the only question you should ask. You should ask how that unemployment is distributed across the population of low wage workers. If a minimum wage hike raises unemployment, causing someone to lose their job and not get a new one for a whole year -- that's a big deal. But let's say instead low wage workers have really high churn rates and maybe work several different jobs over the course of the year, with the unemployment hike boiling down to everyone more or less spending an extra week or two between jobs. Well, in that later case, the unemployment probably isn't a big deal -- you spent a little extra time out of work but the increased wages more than make up for it overall.\n\nWhich case is more realistic? It turns out it's later. Low wage workers exhibit pretty high turnover rates in general and easily exhibit median employment spell lengths &lt; 1 year in the SIPP, along with fairly brief unemployment spells as well. This also shouldn't be too shocking. In general, there are huge flows into and out of employment that regularly dwarf any net changes in employment -- this is actually a huge part of why labor search models have grown in prominence. For  further details on this, you can look into Henry Farber's research, which broadly looks at related topics and has quite a bit to say related to unemployment spells. Now, in general, for providing empirical backing to these claims, I would caution that people don't publish papers just giving descriptive statistics. But I can link you to some papers intimately working with related topics that include the desired figures in their tables and discussion. [This paper](https://sites.hks.harvard.edu/fs/dhojman/papers/MPD_Hojman_Kast.pdf) for example discusses the dynamics of poverty (and links to a bajillion papers on the topic) and how people transition into and out of it pretty rapidly. [This paper](https://arindube.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/dlr2r3_fullpaper.pdf) looks at the effect of the minimum wage on labor market flows, finding that minimum wage hikes don't particularly affect the amount of time spent outside of employment (cheating to cite it hear though because, of course, it comes from outside our hypothetical, where there is lots of monopsony power).\n\n\n\n\nSo where does this get us? Well, before, in our no-monopsony-power analysis we thought minimum wages were bad because the severe utility losses associated with getting stuck in unemployment maybe outweighed the gains experienced by others due to wage hikes. But now we're not so sure. Minimum wages can cause unemployment to go up without *anyone* seeing their compensation over, say, a 2 year period fall. Throw in minimum wages raising wages all the way throughout the bottom quarter of the wage distribution^[1](http://www.nber.org/papers/w16533)^[2](http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/the_ripple_effect_of_the_minimum_wage_on_american_workers/), and thinks are looking good \n\nBut maybe you're not convinced. Sure, you say, maybe some people who spend more time in unemployment really are better off. But maybe some people really do get shipped into long term unemployment. The long run trends in the labor market are, after all, pointing toward reduced dynamism, lower churn rates, and higher long term unemployment rates. That's why we need to switch to a policy like the EITC -- something that helps all low wage workers at no cost. It's just a better policy.\n\nWell, I want to start by pointing out that all policies include tradeoffs. When it comes to the minimum wage in a no monopsony power environment, there is a risk that some people will lose out in terms of unemployment. But if some do, that's not the end of the story. You have to weigh those losses against the gains. No purely redistributive policy, after all, is going to be free. Even the EITC generates distortions and requires a financing mechanism.\n\nBut let's focus a bit on this EITC thing. Y'all seem to be deifying it a bit in r/neoliberal land. Now, I'm not saying it's a bad policy, but it's not exactly all that you crack it up to be. Let's ask a question that often gets passed over in EITC discussions: *what is the incidence of the EITC?*\n\nGet ready for some disappointment. [Rothstein](https://www.princeton.edu/ceps/workingpapers/165rothstein.pdf) has low-skill single moms keeping only 70 cents per dollar of EITC spending. Their employers, meanwhile, get 72 cents on the dollar. Wait, shouldn't that add up to a dollar? Oh don't worry, it does. The EITC depresses wages for recipients and non-recipients alike. The non-recipients? They *lose* 43 cents per EITC dollar. Meaning each dollar of EITC spending raises wages for low-skill workers in general by just, drum roll please, 28 cents. That's a pretty costly way to raise earnings for low-skill workers. And if you wanted to go after the minimum wage for generating winners and losers... \n\nBut, what if there was some sort of way I could change the incidence of the EITC? To make more of the benefits fall on workers by preventing those benefits from leaking out to employers through wage reductions? \n\nWell, [Lee and Saez would like you to know](https://eml.berkeley.edu//~saez/lee-saezJan10minwage.pdf) that the minimum wage would do that for us! By preventing wages from falling, the minimum wage can increase the efficacy of transfer programs like the EITC. So, the minimum wage and the EITC aren't *substitutes*, they're *complements*. By the way, some other neat points in that paper -- they show that minimum wages are welfare improving under perfect competition in general, provided that there is efficient job rationing (meaning that it is marginal workers that get laid off first). \n And check out the optimal tax / optimal minimum wage estimates in [this older version](http://www.nber.org/papers/w14320.pdf) of their paper! Turns out you can get to $15 being optimal, at least in some labor markets.\n\nSo let's wrap up:\n\n* There's monopsony power in the labor market\n* Non-crazy oversized minimum wage hikes don't cause unemployment as a result, with the non-crazy range including $15/hour in some jurisdictions \n* Minimum wage hikes raise wages for more than just the very bottom of the wage distribution\n* Even if minimum wages cause unemployment to go up, they need not lower total annual earnings for anyone (though it probably will for at least some)\n* Even if some people see annual earnings go down, it's probably a good idea anyway provided it's marginal workers who lose their jobs\n* The EITC's welfare math is a bit more complicated than you'd think because of incidence issues\n* The minimum wage and the EITC are complements because the minimum wage can shift the incidence of the EITC away from firms and on to workers\n\nPS - I saw[ some posts complaining](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/6iwulr/eitc_is_better_than_the_minimum_wage/dj9pfjz/) about how the EITC comes as a lumpsum and how that's a really bad thing or something. I don't want to do a whole RI about this, but just a heads up, turns out that's super NBD. People consumption smooth their EITC check over the year [by spending it on durable goods](https://ideas.repec.org/a/fip/fedhep/y2008iqiip17-32nv.32no.2.html).

{"author":"IndyPoker979","created_utc":1515732720,"num_comments":6,"score":2,"selftext":"I've voted Libertarian for years now. Around 6 elections so about 24 years. Ever since a guy by the name of Andrew Horning came to my group and talked about this weird political group called 'Libertarians'.\n\nAnd to my core I still feel very much in support of the party. I will most likely vote for the LP candidate nationally next time, and definitely support the local candidates as I think that the party is the most likely to see national support and to break this two-party system that is a joke.\n\nBut since my son was born things have changed. You see, my son was born with autism.\n\nSo while he is growing up in the world, I'm seeing some things in a different light that I wasn't aware of and wasn't empathetic towards before meeting some other families of people with special needs.\n\nMy core values are such that I'm self-sufficient. I make my bed I lie in it. I don't rely on others to train and raise my son, I work on his education and learning every day and have for the last 5 years.\n\nBut the model of 'Libertarianism' leads to these school systems that are of the opinion that it is too costly for them to allow for special needs children so they just don't allow them to attend. Instead they keep costs of the school down by removing the more expensive students.\n\nThe model of the healthcare for the Libertarians again puts the free market into play which works for me and my wife, but my son and his needs? We would be bankrupt if we weren't so successful in a free market system. Not to mention how much price gouging would occur by the greedy corporations who gain monopolies on certain drugs.\n\nI still value the core aspects of Libertarianism. The self-responsibility, the reduction of restrictions/regulations that have hampered growth both in business and in life. I value the idea that you are responsible for what you put into your body and the amount of income you bring through your work.\n\nI think that as a whole it is the most concise, effective, logical way of approaching society... but I don't know how I can support it knowing that it means that I am dooming my son to a life of ostracizing/minimizing/ignoring.\n\nBecause the free market isn't kind. Neither is the world. \n\nI don't believe in the Democrats view of governing. It gives us rule after rule while they spend without regards to the future.\n\nI don't believe in the Republicans view of governing as it bullies the people into a 'my way or the highway' and the current version of the GOP is reprehensible at minimum. Not to even go into the fact that it is a shill for corporations.\n\nI have always considered myself a minarchist of sorts. But what do you do when the minimum amount of government results in a lack of protection for your children and you don't have the ability to protect them for the rest of their life?\n\n\nIs there a happy medium anywhere in the philosophy/political world for people who want more freedom but not so much that it results in those with more power from being able to abuse it?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Not sure if I'm so enthralled with the philosophy of Libertarianism but I'd really like it to work."}

I'm your host for the day, /u/Conspiracythierry.** It's no secret that President Trump is actively negotiating new legislation effecting DACA and DREAM Act recipients known as DREAMers. Two days ago, President Trump tweeted:       \n\n&gt;The United States needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border, which must be part of any DACA approval. The safety and security of our country is #1! - @realdonaldtrump    \n\nThe Republicans don't want DACA and the Democrats don't want the wall.    \n\n**Let's consider a possible DACA deal scenario.** Would it be a good deal or not to offer DACA a \"lengthy\" path of citizenship to \"quickly\" gain the wall, kill chain migration, immigration lottery, and anchor babies. There's an instinct to say [\"absolutely not,\"](https://kek.gg/i/6DgPYw.jpeg) but it's also important to remember that DACA recipients only reflect [800K-1.3M](http://dailycaller.com/2017/09/11/the-numbers-behind-the-dreamers/) of the total 11M illegals residing in the United States. All non-DACA illegals all still must return home and the United States has experienced a [\"45 year low in illegal immigration this year.\"](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/951441504203104256)    \n\n**Americans in the NO Daca deal camp,** focus on the hundreds of thousands of people coming from [\"shithole countries\"](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/01/11/trump-laments-immigration-from-s-hole-countries-in-oval-office-negotiations.html) who have already received an incredible amount from the American tax payer, at the risk of the prosperity and safety of Americans. Not only have they settled into a country they don't belong in, they actively attempt to influence public policy and law. They are politically sympathetic and well-resourced, and they, along with Democrat leaders, are pushing for generous immigration reform and quick citizenship.    \n\n**As we watch the negotiations unfold,** Trump knows that [Americans have dreams too]( https://kek.gg/i/4TWs5M.jpeg) and will always put the needs of Americans first:    \n\n&gt;We're always talking about dreamers from other countries. I want the children of the United States to have dreams also. - President Donald Trump    \n\nHow do you see it?

Here we talk about the financing of the state and taxes. We critique the concept of taxes and their collection from the ethical point of view. We go deep into the background of each regulation and law, and how to morally justify their backing by force from the side of the police.\n\nLecturer: Urza (www.urza.cz)\n\n--------------------------\n\n\n'Anarcho-capitalism' is a new regular cycle by Parallel Polis, which introduces the value system, on which cryptoanarchy is based.\n\nDoes the word 'anarchy' evoke a picture of chaos in your mind? Do you shake your head when hearing the idea of a stateless society? Do you ask 'Who will build the roads?' The state uses a sophisticated propaganda which is being instilled in us from early age. The power of this manipulation lies in that most people consider the question \"Do we actually need the state?\" already answered in advance. Few people actually think about it critically. In each of the meetups, we will introduce one area of human society which is strongly distorted by the presence of the state and we will show how it could be different. Come to Parallel Polis, step out of familiar stereotypes and be one of those, who would like to try to see society from a different perspective.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Anarcho-capitalism part 1: The State Is Immoral (with English subtitles)"}

Like Monkeys have a certain unpleasant odor.\n\n\nI think you must be still thinking of them as Human beings to even ask the question... You have to wrap your mind around the fact that they are not. They are a failed Ape species that isn't quite Human. Once you get that, you'll just understand.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons, which vary among the breed... They do have stronger sweat glands, because they come from a part of the world where it is very very hot, and having more melanin in their skin, they also give off more oils... \n\nThose are the physical reasons... Here are the ones that are caused by the way they act...\n\n1- Many Niggers don't like to bathe. The sheboons (female niggers) in particular have a thing about getting their hair wet, since doing so ruins the expensive weaving of human hair they usually put in their nappy nigger heads. The water loosens the bond, even just steam does, in case you're thinking, \"Why don't they just wear a shower cap?\". So they will go weeks without washing it. Add that to being just plain lazy when it comes to personal Hygiene, you have a stinky combination.\n\n2- Niggers have a type of skin that, not unlike the hands of a chimp, gets leathery... They call it \"Ashy\"... and when it happens they put this stinky lotion on it, It's usually either Cocoa Butter or another plant called Shea Butter\", which stinks even worse than the first one. Go to a drugstore that caters to niggers and get a whiff of these... You'll recognize the stench immediately. \n\nNow put the body funk of a non bather together with those nasty smelling lotions and you've got some Prime, Grade A NIGGER FUNK. Also, again with the She boons, they have to keep that weave of hair moist, and since Niggers love the scents of \"Tropical\" fruits, such as Mango and Coconut, most of the hair products they use contain those odors... Add that to unwashed dead human hair and... Well... There ya go.\n\nI'm sure others will add things like Jenkem (Fermented Feces and Urine inhaled from Balloons that is used to get high), The stench of clothes that have been permeated with Marijuana smoke and Newport Cigarettes... Eating a ton of Greasy foods like Fried Chicken, Chitlins, and Roughage (Collard Greens) that are a gastrointestinal nightmare that also comes out in the skin...\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s because they are niggers.

There isn't. We are rapidly approaching a time where only one party line is acceptable and not just acceptable, but will be the only one allowed to be mentioned.\n\nThis began with liberals and progressives refusing to even rebut arguments from their opponents because they didn't want to give those arguments publicity. We are now at the point where there is no argument at all because non-left-wing viewpoints are being intentionally blocked and banned. Here on reddit, almost anything not in line with the status quo is downvoted into oblivion. There are subs in which contradictory arguments, even reasoned ones, get the user perma-banned.\n\nThe only saving grace to this is that there is diversity on the Left, just as there is on the Right. Once social media starts pushing far left ideals and selecting candidates for office, many on the Left will push back. But many won't. For some, even a hack Democratic candidate is better than a principled non-Democratic candidate. Win at all costs.

I would say I am a mix of Libertarian on some things (including guns), and \"Progressive\" on other things. I do agree and disagree with both groups on a number of issues. But I also have this crazy idea that Libertarians and Progressives agree with each other on a lot more than either side may believe. (Agreements which often go against the DemoRepublicratican-Washington consensus) And so I'd like to see if I may be onto something here.\n\nRECAP: Some of you may remember the first in my series of issue-specific posts (a couple weeks ago) on this subreddit to help me get an idea of which way the Libertarian wind blows on specific issues. I would like to thank those of you who contributed to that post in a meaningful way. You folks certainly broadened my understanding on the history of the Net Neutrality debate in general, as well as the Libertarian viewpoint specifically. Those comments made it clear to me that Libertarians and \"the Left\" do not quite see as eye-to-eye on every detail of the issue. But it is still my belief that our two groups are far more ideologically aligned with each other (on the broad strokes) than either of us are with the GOP or Democratic establishments. It is my sincere hope that we can continue this sort of dialogue on a weekly/biweekly basis. \n\nTHIS WEEK: I would like to throw out a random idea on which I am pretty sure Progressives and Libertarians would be greatly in agreement on.\n\nMy personal thoughts on Prostitution are such. Live and let live. I believe this is, by and large, also the way my fellow progressives lean. Legalization would reduce violence towards sex workers because they could work more or less in public with better security than a \"pimp.\" Likewise STD rates would probably go down, though I have no evidence to back up that idea. Most importantly, legalization would put an end to the sex slave market/human trafficking.

Who would have thought? lol\n\nHere's the really interesting part: \n\n&gt;What about the competition?\n\n&gt;There is almost none. The ISP market appears to have been oligopolized by the titans, and for a good reason. The market has an extremely high barrier to entry. The costs associated with creating cabling infrastructure are beyond astronomical. So, even if a would-be start up had the incentive to enter the market, doing so is virtually impossible. To illustrate this, let\u2019s take a look at an example.\n\n&gt;Back in 2013, Google announced its Fiber project. Digital Trends estimated that it could cost $94 million to build. Since the net neutrality repeal puts power back into the hands of ISPs, the end users are expected to suffer. Corporations like Comcast, Verizon, AT&amp;T, Charter, and Time Warner will profit.\n\n&gt;According to data published on BGR in December 2013, 67 percent of Americans have two or less options when it comes to internet service providers.\n\n&gt;At the moment, the ripple effect of FCC\u2019s net neutrality repeal seems to be leaving its mark on the market. Although it has always been dominated by a small number of corporations, the repeal seems to have given even more maneuver space to industry titans.\n\n&gt;Since the repeal is practically still in its infancy, end users still haven\u2019t been really affected by it. However, it has recently come out that the FCC wants to redefine (and lower) American broadband standards in relation to upload and download speed, so instead of having to offer a minimum of 25 megabits per second for download speed and 3 megabits for upload speed, ISPs will now have to meet a minimum of 10 megabits per second for download speed and 1 megabit per second for upload speed.\n\n&gt;Lowering these standards will affect the end user, but will it affect the market? Lack of competition, a high barrier to entry, and the market\u2019s oligopolistic nature promise more of the same.\n\nSeems like a bit of a stalemate situation to me.

I wouldn't want them to go to jail for it; they did nothing wrong so putting them in a cell against their will would be nothing less than kidnapping. I don't want to be a part in that; if anything I want to protect the person from it, not make it more likely. But if I keep the information to myself, that's contempt of court, and if I tell a lie to protect them, that's perjury. Both are criminal charges with serious penalties, for nothing more than failing to reveal information that's my own to reveal or keep to myself. And I could be roped into this dilemma by nothing more than being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Then I have to either assist in victimizing an innocent person, or risk being victimized myself. And to add insult to injury, most people would even claim that the court is in the right, and that I'm morally obligated to testify.\n\nIs anyone else scared of this prospect? Does anyone know of any ways I could, if faced with this situation, make sure I don't make things any worse for the defendant, without putting myself at risk?\n\nWhy don't we have something like jury nullification for witnesses?\n\n**EDIT:** /u/DarthFluttershy made an important point in a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/7r2fjj/anyone_else_worried_theyll_accidentally_witness/dstvpru/):\n\n&gt; Though that does give rise to a scenario I think might not be avoidable. Say you own a store with security cameras and they subpoena the tape. Than I'm not sure what your options are. \n\nYeah, what if something happens that unintentionally leaves a record somewhere under my control? What do I do?\n\nCome to think of it I do like taking pictures and stuff when I see something interesting; it would suck to not be able to do that out of fear of being forced against my will to turn them over for a cause I feel strongly against. I wonder if there could be some loophole there involving a third party? Like I send it to someone in another jurisdiction (that won't subpoena them for it) and delete my own copy as soon as possible. Then I get it back from them after sufficient time has passed that I know no subpoena will occur. I could even tell them to ignore any requests from me for the information until a certain time, in case the court decides they can compel me to request it from the third party for them. Maybe that would be a good idea for a startup website? I'd have to host it in some other country though. Still a cumbersome and inconvenient solution for a problem that shouldn't even exist.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Anyone else worried they'll accidentally witness an illegal act that shouldn't be illegal, and be forced to testify?"}

{"author":"bduxbellorum","created_utc":1516225969,"num_comments":5,"score":2,"selftext":"In a conversation with a talented math bio professor at my university, we were discussing the fact that at international universities, nearly all faculty either completed their graduate degrees or completed a post-doc in the US. His observation was that international scientists at the top tier aren't taken seriously unless they have done significant work in the US. \n\n\nFor this reason, most nations send their best and brightest to the US to go to school. Either as undergraduates or grad students, the US holds a monopoly on high quality education. Sure, we do hear about high level research coming out of some major international universities, but it's clear that most of the renowned (and best funded) schools are in the states. \n\n\nThing is, many of the best and brightest who come to the US for school decide to stay. Since they are talented, they get jobs, and certainly displace natural born citizens. Most conservatives probably don't fixate on these, the best and brightest, but they certainly get pretty loud when less qualified immigrants enter the country and \"steal jobs.\" I began thinking about this process from a libertarian perspective and realized there's a major discussion people pretty much ignore these days. \n\n\nThe US is a pretty new country. There are some old families, but for the most part we (the main-stream) are immigrants. Many within 1-2 generations. Somehow we became \"Americans\" without any incumbent lineage to speak-of. \n\nSo what does it mean to be an American? The original immigration policy of the US came with only one requirement: \n\n1. An oath of allegiance to support the Constitution of the United States. \n\nOver time, 4 more clauses have been added, the first two benign, the last two not so. \n\n2. (1795) To renounce allegiance to any foreign country.\n3. (1906) To Defend the Constitution of the United States against enemies Foreign and Domestic\n4. (1950) Promise to serve in the Armed Forces when required by law. \n5. (1950) Promise to perform civilian duties of national importance when required by law. \n\n\n4 and 5 are vile stipulations remnant from the rise of nationalism and totalitarianism that festered through the cold war and resulted in our much bloated Federal apparatus today.  \n\nThat said, the basic message of our citizenship process is as long as they commit to our constitution, anybody can become an American. \n\n\nPut another way, displacing natural born citizens is a small price to pay if we are able to expand the number of people who have committed to our ideals of freedom, whether they are Mexican citrus pickers or Chinese computer scientists. The concept of turning away immigrants willing to accept that commitment is un-American. ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"US Citizenship and the corruption of Conservativism toward Nationalism"}

I cannot tell you how many poor people often scoff at the rich business owners because they are just lucky to have been born from wealthy parents. Hell I even see middle class people who are well off attacking the Bill Gates and other successes as lazy imbeciles who are just \"sitting on their butts all day long\" and they are hoarding wealth so it should be distributed.  I seen from the general populace, both poor and middle class, attack the capitalist system because business men aren't really doing hardwork nor are they producing anything of value.\n\nI will admit just for the sake of what I will say in a minute that I am not a conservative. I've been raised in a minarchist household that favors neither leftist nor rightest view but merely view government should have minimal interaction in everything from what movies you watch to visiting a brothel to AK47 owndership. So yes I already have views that are contradictory to conservative idealism.\n\nYet I could never understand the criticism \"business men are lazy because they inherited their richness\" and \"running a business is as easy as 123!\". Even before I started going into the stock market, I already had first hand experience of how running a business would be like via stays at my auntie (who I mentioned in one of the above reddit links, owns a restaurant). In addition to seeing the dangers and difficulties of kitchen cookings, everytime I stayed over I would always hear her at night getting enraged as she spoke on the phone as she was speaking with employees, partners, and other business associates about so many complex subjects such as paying the bills, trying to get a new insurance company's support, difficulties with kitchen equipment, etc. I could always see how stressed my auntie would be everytime she woke up before she drank coffee and took a bath.\n\nMind you my auntie is actually quite a successful business owner. At the time she already had a $1,000,000 (I was 14 when she had that amount) in one of her bank accounts and when I talked to her which was weeks before I tried to get into stocks and bonds recently, she told me she had amassed a little over $10 million in that specific bank account. This is not counting assets, her other bank account savings, etc. But I can see despite being merely 46, she's already full of gray hair (I'm only 22 just to put this into perspective).\n\nSo I was not naive to believe I'll get rich quick when I tried to enter stock market recently as I already know first hand how hard business can be. Yet even I was caught off guard at how simplistic stuff such as comparing different stocks in chart analysis could be.\n\nSo it makes me wonder why the politically left and anarchist as well as poor and many middle class people think running a business and investments is a cakewake? And why many of them think just because Trump was given a lot of cash to start business  by his already rich dad that it was easy as playing video games for him to run his enterprises?\n\nI mean has any one seen how Tom Kalinske left his job as CEO of Sega of America with grey hair just because the stress of company politics got him? Or how medical analysts are saying Steve Jobs had a relatively young death because of his diseases which they theorized was probably caused by being overworked running Apple?\n\nI would like your input libertarians!","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How legit is the criticism that many current successful businessmen and investors inherited their wealth and/or company or came from educated upper middle class backgrounds?

But the enemy in this case is free:  spying is sorta cheap when it comes down to it.   \n\nWhat's not is the shit state, for lack of better terms as it's the logical extension of the nefarious and nebulous \"deep state\" that is more often and finally becoming a pronounced fact of our existence.   \n\nBut whatever path you get there, from antigovernment deep state theories to progressive ideals, the best end to our situation is a classic reorganization of how we've been doing things before.  \n\nWhat we're doing today is profoundly expensive and it doesn't work for how much it is morally reprehensible and is equally and fiscally objectionable.  \n\nEliminating the cost of deeply unamerican machines like spying, prisons, and warfare would let socialist states like mine in California have all the money they want to engage in ventures like government healthcare as they would to liberate the tax base in states that don't want anything to do with that and enjoy their economic freedom.  \n\nI've long believed that government defined by the rule of the people is only the best when it's closer to home, but I don't know where to go from there.  \n\nI have watched libertarianism for two decades and wish it worked better in the United States and want to make it work because it's long goddamn time.  \n\nI appreciate the read and any comments or suggestions.\n\nThank you.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Are liberal progressives and Libertarians really that different when it comes down to it, especially from an economic perspective?"}

Services that are not temporarily ended will continue on with their reserve funds.  Action items that were planned for this time but delayed will continue once the shutdown ends, with potentially higher costs due to the delay.\n\nTemporary funding measures, that often hail the lead up to a shutdown, do not save money.  They waste it in even grandeur fashion than normal budgets because most of the spending from a previous budget is simply \"locked in\" for X amount of days.  For example say some construction was funded in the last real spending bill, but Congress can't agree on a new spending bill so they extend the previous one.  Problem is, that construction is already complete but its getting money all the same.  Thats waste.

Nothing.\n\nWhat the shutdown ***SHOULD*** tell us is that the government shouldn't be so partisan that such waste is acceptable in order to stop CHIP and a DACA provision.  It also tells us that the government spending shouldnt be so great and/or so centralized so that when shutdowns occur there's no run away waste.\n\nLibertarians should be pissed at their inept government wasting money in even worse ways, instead of getting all giggly about the word \"shutdown\" itself ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The shutdown doesn't change anything libertarians complain about, you people cheering are idiots"}

It is very critical of wage labor relationships with employers and promotes worker self-management of the workplace.\n\nIt sort of makes the argument that a critical part of abolishing authoritarian structures is removing their ownership of means of production.\n\nIt advocates for these things within the frame of voluntary human relationships, which makes it very distinct from Marxism or social democracy within socialism.\n\nIt is, however, anti-capitalist, mainly in that such structures  affect actual freedom. That is, it rejects the idea that the freedom of choice a capitalist system presents is actually freedom, regardless of the fact that you have choice, because which choices you have available are largely outside of your control. So while it rejects the idea of state ownership or control of the economy, it also rejects capitalism, and instead tries to promote a more equal distribution of working capital, as within the philosophy degrees of capital are closely tied to degrees of freedom.\n\nIt's an individualist socialist framework, but it definitely runs counter to many of the things I see here pretty often.

Here in this article, we are going to share few tips on how to charge your smartphone and make its battery last longer.\n\n\u00a0Also Read:Top 5 Best Game Hacking Apps with download links For Android 2018 (No Root)\n\n\n10 Things You Should Never Do While Charging Your Smartphone.\n\nToday, more than billions are using Android/iOS devices. Everyone encounters a problem with battery reinforcement. A mobile operating system like Android consumes much battery compared to others.\n\nOn the average, our smartphone battery lasts about 7-8 hours. Long lasting battery life was always an important factor for buyers to consider before purchasing any phone.\n\n\u00a0Also Read:\u00a040 keyboard Shortcuts You Should Keep Note Of\n\n\nHowever, there are few phone charging habits you can implement in your daily life that can increase the longevity of your device\u2019s battery. Here in this article, we are going to share few tips on how to charge your smartphone and make its battery last longer.\n\n1.\u00a0Charge Your Smartphone with Original Charger\nIt will be best if you charge your phone with its own charger. Very often due to our busy schedule, we forgot to carry the original charger and replace it with a duplicate one. This is what affects battery performance. If you are using a replacement charger then, check its output voltage (V) and current (Ampere).\n\n2.\u00a0Avoid Fast Chargers\nFast chargers might not be the best option for your battery\u2019s overall health. Charging your smartphone with fast chargers can damage your battery in a long run. This process involves higher voltage which lets to high temperature. So, make sure to avoid using fast chargers.\n\n3.\u00a0Remove protective case while charging\nYou might have noticed, while our phone is on the charge, it becomes slightly warm. So, make sure to remove the phone\u2019s protective case while charging. This can act as a barrier and slow down heat dissipation. If possible, try to flip the phone over while charging\n\n\u00a0Also Read:\u00a03 Ways To Boost Up Game Performance On Android Device\n\n\n4.\u00a0Never Leave Your Phone To charge overnight\nThere are many people, including me who left the phone plugged in overnight for charging. We just need to cut this practice. Charging overnight affects battery longevity, and it also makes your smartphone overheat. Therefore, make sure to unplug your charge when you feel it is sufficiently charged.\n\n5.\u00a0Avoid third party battery apps\nYou might have already installed a battery or power management app on your smartphone. There are many applications available in Google Play Store that claims to increase the battery life of Android. However, these apps will not do any good to your battery because it increases the load on the smartphone and forces the device to use more battery power.\n\n6.\u00a0Avoid Gaming\nEveryone loves to play games on their smartphones. Nowadays games are so addictive that we can\u2019t resist without them. However, if gaming is the main reason behind your battery draining, then you should stop to play games while charging. This will not only charge your smartphone fast but will also eliminate overheating issues.\n\n7.\u00a0Always Charge Up To 80%\nWe must admit that 80% charge is enough for a day, and it\u2019s ideal for overall battery lifespan. Crossing the 80% mark can make your battery to overheat, thereby affecting battery\u2019s life. So, it\u2019s not necessary that your smartphone should always be topped up to a maximum.\n\n\u00a0Also Read:\u00a0Top 10 Best Games you must Try out on Your Android Device\n\n\n8.\u00a0Avoid Constant recharge\nWe always tend to charge our smartphone when it reaches the 50% battery mark. However, that\u2019s not the best thing to do. Users must allow the battery to discharge to around 20% before they plug it in. Studies have claimed that unnecessary and frequent recharges shorten the lifespan of the battery.\n\n9.\u00a0Use Powerbanks\nThe best way to provide your smartphone an extended battery life is to have a power bank. However, while buying a power bank, you need to notice few things like your power bank should promise protection against voltage surge, short circuit, overcharging etc. These features will make sure that the battery of your smartphone lasts longer.\n\n10.\u00a0Avoid Using Phone While It\u2019s connected to Powerbank\nAs we all know, using a smartphone while charging might not be a good idea. So, you should avoid using your phone while it\u2019s connected to the power bank. Using your phone while connected to Powerbank will increase the internal temperatures and shorten battery life.\n\nPost source @: https://www.techzvibes.xyz/2018/01/10-things-you-should-never-do-while.html?m=1","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"10 Things You Should Never Do While Charging Your Smartphone"}

I was one of those kids.\n\nThe juvenile judge worked closely with schools and police to have a zero tolerance system for juveniles.\n\nThe County run detention center was closed down due to the work of these judges and this property owner. A private detention center was built and the judges were offered kickbacks for sending kids there since the privately run detention center was paid for having the kids. (Through CYS or some form of the government, I'm not sure)\n\nMy first offense was when I was 14. My mom and I had gotten into an argument and I wanted to \"run away\". She stood in front of the door and I pushed her out of the way and left. Took a walk in the woods and came back home to find the police. She called them because I left. She just wanted help finding me, but they arrested me. Simple assault for pushing her.\nI was put away for 6 months. My mom called everyone she could and somehow managed to get me out. \n\nMy second and final juvenile offense was when I was 15. I was in school playing with some ketchup packets or something equally as childish. One of the cafeteria aids came over and began yelling at me. I was a cocky little teenager and I made up some story about my dad being someone important and told her she would lose her job. I ran my finger across my throat when I told her this.\nThe rest of the day went by and I was called down to the office just before dismissal. My mom was there and a police officer came. They all went into the office and I assumed the school was trying to scare me...\nI was arrested and sent to the detention center. The judge told me I was charged with terroristic threats for threatening to kill the cafeteria aid. I was sent away for a little over two years.\n\nThere were no defense attorneys into he courtrooms. Only the judge and the children. We all knew he was very strict since he had visited our schools many times and talked to us about crimes and how he would have zero tolerance. \nI had no idea at the time that anything was wrong with the system. Every kid just thought it was normal. \nAbout a year after I was released the situation was exposed and investigated. The judges were arrested and the children were part of a class action lawsuit.\n\nI spent a year and half of my high school years getting a very dulled down education consisting of multiplication tables and learning middle school level history. I was between 50 and 200 miles away from my family and because of this I went months without visits. I got a phone call once every few days if I was lucky. I was housed with kids who had gun charges, drug charges, and attempted murder charges. I was borderline abused by staff members.\nThe class action settlement was about $20,000, which I don't know if that made up for everything.\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/gallery/Y35F4\n\nEDIT: documentary is here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxpNynnYwC0\n\nAsk me anything.\n\nEdit: I chose to not use the word \"victim\" because I do not see myself as a victim. I did what I did. I may not have deserved what I got, but I initiated what happened.\nI don't want pity, or anything of the sort. Just getting the rest of this situation off my chest and answering questions anyone may have about what happened.\n\nI took some steps to hide my identity, but with the story taking place in scuba small area and with personal details being put out, it's very easy to figure out. Who I am doesn't have to do with the story, but I don't care if anyone knows who I am or not.\n\nThe documentary has apparently been removed from Netflix but is still on YouTube.

It seems there isn't enough thought into the repercussions on not getting it right from the start. Scheduling should be thought out and correct and taken deadly seriously! People's health and freedom hangs in the balance. If it can't be improved we need a new system entirely.\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n**Lets get started**\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nI am convinced the controlled substance schedule was determined by a **stupid ~ monkey** throwing darts at a list of medications\n\n\n-\n\n\n**Definition of a Monkey**\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n* Monkeys are haplorhine primates\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n**Definition of Stupid**\n\n* 1: slow of mind, given to unintelligent decisions or acts : \nacting in an unintelligent or careless mannerc :  lacking intelligence or reason :  brutish \n* 2:  dulled in feeling or sensation :  torpid &lt;still stupid from the sedative\n* 3:  marked by or resulting from unreason ed thinking or acting :  senseless &lt;a stupid decision&gt;\n* 4:  a: lacking interest or point &lt;a stupid event&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n*Excuse the sarcasism, this topic heats me up*\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n**Currently the Controlled Drug Schedule**\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n*Penalties as you can see are much more severe as you move down the scheduling ladder*\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n* **Schedule I** substances include Marijuana (controversy exists about its placement in Schedule I); Heroin; MDMA; Psilocybin (hallucinogenic mushrooms); Foxy (5-methoxy-N-diisopropyltryptamine); LSD; Peyote; Mescaline; GHB (Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid)\n\n\n-\n\n\nUnlawful possession of a Schedule I substance, other than less than one ounce marijuana, is a Class B felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines. \n\n\n-\n\n\n* **Schedule II** substances include Cocaine; Methamphetamine; Opium; Laudanum; Methadone; Oxycodone (Percocet, OxyContin, Percodan); Morphine; Dilaudid (Hydromorphone); Pure Codeine; Pure Hydrocodone; PCP \n\n\n-\n\n\n\nUnlawful possession of Class II substances is a Class C felony punishable by up to 5 years in prison and $125,000 in fines.\n\n-\n\n\n* **Schedule III** substances include Hydrocodone when compounded with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as acetaminophen (e.g., Vicodin) or ibuprofen (e.g., Vicoprofin); Codeine when compounded with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as acetaminopen (Tylenol 3); Ketamine; Anabolic Steroids; Marinol, (a synthetic form of THC) \n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\nUnlawful possession of Schedule III substances is a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to 1 year in jail and $6,250 in fines.\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n* **Schedule IV** drugs in this schedule include Benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), and diazepam (Valium); Rohypnol (roofies)\n\n\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n\nUnlawful possession of Schedule IV substances is a Class C Misdemeanor and is punishable by up to thirty days in jail and $1,250 in fines.\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n**Examples of Mis-Scheduling**\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n* The most deadly drug per capita both social and physical is alcohol and nicotine a close second. They aren't scheduled. Why? There was a specific exemption in the Controlled Substances Act. Mark Kleiman, a drug policy expert, argues both would be marked C1 if they were evaluated today, since they're widely used recreationally, addictive, detrimental to one's health, society and deadly\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n* It took 500,000 overdose fatalities for the Fed's to reschedule opioid pain killers from C4 to C2. Heroin is chemically 99% identical to next-gen opioids such as OxyContin. Heroin was , of course scheduled C1 along with LSD for a decade while new, novel Opioid pain killers were C4, less controlled than testosterone and prescription cough syrup?!\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n* Cannabis is C1 alongside Foxy (5-methoxy-N-diisopropyltryptamine); LSD and GHB (Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid) ......while Rohypinal 'date rape drug' is scheduled C4 along with Ambien?....Feds just a tip. If a drug is widely know as the 'Date Rape Drug,' you might want to shorten the leash on that one.\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n* Marinol is a C3 FDA approved prescription medication whose active ingredient is a synthetic form of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) the active ingredient in cannabis, Cannabis is CI and three double-blind trials showed natural cannabiods had less psychoactive  effects than Marinol.\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n* Why the F is PCP scheduled with Ritalin? Wait, lets back up why isn't it C1? Hey, let's have a little experiment. Swap out little Timmy's Ritalin tablet for 'Angel Dust,' and instead of finishing that science project Timmy takes off all his clothes and runs naked down the freeway, not with traffic but against it of course\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n* Gabapentin used to treat nerve pain and seizures RX growth is at an all-time high. \nGabapentin is a medication that is structurally related to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Gabapentin is not a controlled substance, but has the same torrid history of misuse, addiction, withdrawal syndrome and psychoactive effects that mimic benzodiazepines. If the DEA has decided benzodiazepines should be C4 they should be consistent and C4 Gabapentin\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n* Testosterone C3 makes no sense. Yes, I get it bodybuilders and athletes abuse it, but it's not an intoxicant and abusing it isn't putting the public in danger. It's not the gov't business as long as it isn't putting the public at risk.  My testicles produce testosterone. I guess that makes me a criminal, b/c I don't have a prescription.\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n&gt; **ME**  \"Judge, I swear I had no idea they were manufacturing a controlled substance!\"\n\n\n\n&gt; **JUDGE** \"100 hrs. community service\"\n\n\n\n&gt; **ME** \"but, but, but\"\n\n\n\n&gt; **JUDGE** \"State vs. Mr. Smith's testicles is adjourned\"\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n* These are just several examples that show that common sense isn't being applied, or better said little thought, little time, little importance\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n**Can the Feds just Reschedule the Mis-Scheduled Drugs?**\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n*Well, it's not that easy. Big pharma lobby would succeed in blocking a controlled drug C1-C3 rescheduled to C4+*\n\n\n-\n\n\n*I remember yrs. ago a company Alza developed a delivery system making it all but impossible to deliver Ritalin intravenously or Intranasually, thus drastically reducing its abuse potential. The analyst community was buzzing when Alza filed for C3 approval (all other methylphenidate products were C2. Literally one analyst report later big pharma catches wind of it and POOF they refiled under C2*\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n*All controlled drugs are in huge markets, where pharma has multi-billions invested, A major reschedule would disrupt the pharmaceutical market share war.*\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n*Another, often ignored, big hurdle is international treaties. The US is party to international agreements that effectively require some drugs, including cannabis, to remain within the scheduling system in schedule 1 or 2.*\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n*Cannabis has/is the focal point regarding the integrity of the Scheduled system. The Pro-legalization groups and supporters have a strong argument that cannabis is less addictive than heroin, meth, cocaine, nicotine, and alcohol, but fail to see the 'elephant in the room,' that torpedoes their case. The widespread recreational use of cannabis is 'proof positive,' 'air tight' evidence that cannabis has a 'high abuse risk,''* \n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n*Therefore, rescheduling cannabis would 'open a can of worms,' and  'topple the apple cart,' highlighting the broken schedule system. This would put other drugs, drug companies, international treaties et al. up for scrutiny.*\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n*Federal re-scheduling of cannabis will never happen, even if Americans overwhelmingly demand it. That's why politicians throw this hot potato to the state legislators*\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\nI will add more examples when I have time\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n**Browse my sub and see for yourself the shocking fraud that has polluted the drug industry and the regulatory bodies charged with protecting us**\n\n","subreddit":"Badpill","title":"Monkey Throwing Darts""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"[deleted]","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Monkey Throwing Darts"}

If this is your first time hearing of the Q anon, I hope you will take everything I say with a grain of salt and come to your own conclusion. The purpose of this post is to present proof Q is not a LARP, highlight some unusual activity that has occurred over the past few months, as well as discuss this so-called \"awakening\" from more of a psychological perspective. This word is thrown around so much it is hard to take it seriously anymore. \n\n**Updated Q Map** - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZSZmPcI67cTBnSWdKv4378bxmnFpA2WD/view?usp=sharing\n\n(Full transcription of the original posts from Q on 4chan &amp; 8chan, worldwide news, Anon\u2019s analysis / theories, useful info graphs and links.)\n\n**What is Q?**\n\nQ is an anon who has been posting since the end of October, prior to the coup in Saudia Arabia. He initially started posting on /pol/, before migrating to the 8chan board, The Calm Before The Storm, claiming his 4chan tripcode was compromised. In the last few weeks, Q claimed the 8chan board was compromised and has moved again to another board on 8chan. \n\n**Why is this not a LARP?**\n\nLARPing stands for *Live Action Role Playing*. It is by far, the easiest and most effective way to derail an anonymous posting that contrasts your own worldview. In the case of many chan anons, authenticating themselves is a catch 22. Reveal too much information, and they give away their identity. Reveal too little, and it is easy to drown out the message. Q has gone above and beyond in proving his authenticity. From posting quotes, word for word, that the president would tweet minutes later, to warnings about false flag attempts. Here are a few examples below:\n\n[NYC False Flag](https://i.redd.it/xejdzbgnnha01.jpg)\n\n[Hawaii Missile Scare](https://i.redd.it/i11916a4nha01.jpg) More info: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CBTS_Stream/comments/7q7pzs/q_stringer_foretold_connecting_yesterdays_assange/)\n\n[The Pope changing the Lord's Prayer?](https://i.redd.it/4evvhioenha01.jpg)\n\n[Here is a Reddit post that highlights 35 World Events that support Q's posts as being true](https://www.reddit.com/r/CBTS_Stream/comments/7o5kag/35_world_events_that_support_qs_posts_are_true/)\n\nWhether Q is truly representing the good guys trying to drain the swamp or is an intelligence psych-op to consolidate power, is anybody's guess. However, Q's portrayal in the mainstream media leads me to believe my first assumption. It should not come as a surprise it is lumped in with other conspiracies that many of us believe to be true.\n\nhttp://nymag.com/selectall/2017/12/qanon-4chan-the-storm-conspiracy-explained.html\n\nhttps://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2018/01/09/sean-hannity-wades-message-board-conspiracy-theory-storm/219013\n\nhttps://www.dailydot.com/unclick/spacex-launch-zuma-conspiracy/\n\nhttps://www.avclub.com/theres-a-new-insane-conspiracy-theory-tearing-up-4chan-1821432397\n\nhttp://metro.co.uk/2017/11/20/followthewhiterabbit-is-possibly-the-craziest-conspiracy-theory-of-all-time-7092659/\n\nhttps://www.yahoo.com/news/six-facts-incredibly-odd-white-rabbit-conspiracy-theory-trump-fans-sharing-131435153.html\n\nI certainly found it interesting that almost every single article felt the need to compare Q anon and The Storm to the Pizzagate talking points. Some of those articles have not aged well. \n\n**Related to The Storm?**\n\n[DOJ announces indictment in bribery scheme that may be tied to Russia Uranium One deal](http://www.worldtribune.com/doj-co-president-of-maryland-based-firm-indicted-in-bribery-scheme-tied-to-russia-uranium-one-deal/)\n\n[Over 9000 sealed indictments](https://www.theepochtimes.com/justice-department-may-have-something-big-in-the-works-over-9000-sealed-indictments_2401511.html)\n\n[Fusion GPS and the \u2018Insurance Policy\u2019 to Prevent Trump From Becoming President](https://m.theepochtimes.com/fusion-gps-and-the-insurance-policy-to-prevent-trump-from-becoming-president_2417742.html)\n\n**\"The truth would put 99% of people in the hospital.\"**\n\nQ posted that quote in early November. He has mentioned and alluded to that idea numerous times in future postings. From everything that I have read or watched over the years, many conspiracies have a dark part to them. Human trafficking, adrenochrome, satanic rituals, pedophilia and political blackmail, democide, etc., is only the tip of the iceberg. Ignorance can certainly be bliss, but the truth is liberating. Q has indicated all those theories are true. \n\nThe biggest issue any \"good guy\" would face with revealing all the sick, and disgusting truths of this world would be by those in power spinning the information in a way that they could retain control. Millions of people have a worldview that they hold that is part of their identity, it is the root of their self. If that identity was fractured overnight, people would have psychotic breakdowns. ER's would be flooded and there would be many suicides. The economy would implode (not that a correction isn't due, there is nothing organic about the DOW). However, slowly releasing information of actions going on behind the scenes is a great way to waken people without heads exploding. \n\nI have had many conversations with people who believe in conspiracies, but aren't interested in looking further due to how dark they get. A common question that I am asked is \"How do you sleep anymore?\" I wish I had a good answer to that. However, the only way this all stops is if a critical mass of people become aware of it. Could Q just be phase 1 of disclosing this to the public? Maybe not phase 1, but a preface to future events and past events? \n\n**Recent Q posts**\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/HvLTn\n\nQ posted this [link yesterday as well](https://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2015/06/communism-in-jarretts-family/) \n\nThe memo? - https://imgur.com/a/qSTE5\n\n\n**Updated Q Map** -\n https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZSZmPcI67cTBnSWdKv4378bxmnFpA2WD/view?usp=sharing \n\n(Full transcription of the original posts from Q on 4chan &amp; 8chan, worldwide news, Anon\u2019s analysis / theories, useful info graphs and links.)\n\n&gt;\u201cTruth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn't.\u201d\n\n&gt;-- Mark Twain\n\nEdit: typo\n\nEdit2: No need to ask to share this post.

By introducing a line where killing a fetus or person who cannot consent makes an impossible counter for someone who ends up in that scenario later in life. For example, if you claim that an abortion is ok as long as the fetus cannot sustain a heart beat or live on its own, it is ok to terminate the pregnancy. How do you defend that principle for someone with a pace-maker or someone on artifical life support.

I don\u2019t know whether it really belongs here, as I wrote it more from that angle, because my aim was to post it somewhere neutral, as I\u2019ve never posted in political subs before. Before it was deleted, someone commented telling me I sounded like a Libertarian, so here I am.\n\nBackground: Twenties, male, U.S. I\u2019ve been blissfully ignorant to anything having to do with politics basically my entire life. To tell the truth, I didn\u2019t know what \u2018capitalist\u2019 or \u2018socialist\u2019 meant until a year or so ago. Barely knew the difference between the two major parties. Just ignored it. All throughout high school and beyond, all of my friends were extremely liberal; I mostly agreed with them on a whole bunch of social issues when they\u2019d ask my opinion, and I actually still do. I\u2019m also married to a beautiful, intelligent, self-proclaimed feminist.\n\nI always saw keeping up with politics and current events, at least to the point of being able to give an informed opinion on it, as something that required a lot of time, attention, and natural interest. I wasn\u2019t exactly wrong; it kind of does. I\u2019m not even close yet, in my eyes, which is why I\u2019ve never registered to vote, and also the reason for this throwaway.\n\nAs far as social issues, I can kind of tell where I stand. I have no problem with gay people, or them getting married. I think that abortion should be available and accessible. I think it should be illegal to own a gun. I\u2019ve been an atheist from a young age. I think trans people should be able to do and say whatever they want, as long as nobody gets mad at me for saying \u2018she\u2019 if I don\u2019t know you and you appear to be a \u2018she\u2019. There are no minority groups I dislike. I\u2019m not sexist, I think women should be equal in every way. I think symbols like flags and anthems should be treated as such, and not like something that\u2019ll invoke the wrath of Zeus if someone burns it or puts it on the ground or turns it upside down or doesn\u2019t stand up.\n\nBut.\n\nI have a problem with illegal immigrants. In any country, at any time, of whatever race. I don\u2019t think any of them should be shown leniency when it comes to deportation. It\u2019s a law, and, if it\u2019s a law, it needs to be followed. If you don\u2019t like it, then do what you can to change that law. Don\u2019t propose that we take this whole group of people and decide, as one, to just ignore the law for them because it\u2019s easier.\n\nI have a problem with this new wave of man-hating feminists. It\u2019s not about equality anymore. If it was, it wouldn\u2019t be a new \u2018wave\u2019, it would just still be feminism. It\u2019s now about how far apart your legs are on the bus, hats that look like vaginas, contests to see who can list more reasons they\u2019re oppressed, sexual assault allegations after anyone anywhere does anything, and calling for violence. I can\u2019t find a redeeming quality about the whole thing. Whether you think women are still treated as less and still have to keep fighting for equality, or think it\u2019s a bunch of horse shit and exaggeration, why would this be the way for anyone, on any side, to go about doing anything?\n\nI have a problem with all of these people calling for socialism and communism. I can\u2019t even tell if they\u2019re serious half the time. Like I said, I didn\u2019t understand these concepts a year ago. I knew I was a blank slate, so when I first started to become interested in all of this, I actually asked my friend/coworker/history nerd to explain the basic philosophies of capitalism and socialism to me, in a nutshell, one at a time, without any stigma attached to them. Guess which one, based on just my common sense, sounded a lot like people who wanted to be able to vote on whether they should be able to steal someone else\u2019s stuff.\n\nI have a problem with people who insist on scoffing, making a face, and reciting this week\u2019s popular complaint or outrage every time Donald Trump\u2019s name is mentioned. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t look up to the guy. I also don\u2019t think that the president is really personally responsible for nearly as many things as most people seem to think, anyway, but still. I read the other day, \u201cthink of him as the pilot of the airplane that we\u2019re all on for at least the next three years. Do you want him to fail, or to succeed?\u201d You\u2019re going to be hearing his name regularly for (at least) those three years, so just accept it.\n\nI don\u2019t know why I wrote all of this out. I think because I can\u2019t talk to anyone in my real life about any of my different views except my parents, and I wanted to express it in my own words for once without caring about being judged or hated, even just in a place like this, to a bunch of strangers. \n\nThanks.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I\u2019ve been trying to figure out where I stand, politically, and I have more conservative leanings than I had realized."}

{"author":"GuineaPigApocalypse","created_utc":1516849316,"num_comments":16,"score":1,"selftext":"Hi all, I was hoping for a general libertarian view on a discussion I had recently.\n\nI had heard [ETA: from TV news] about a company selling an expensive injectable \u201cmedicine\u201d to the public, for which they had never produced any scientific evidence (or even any evidence of research), while also making claims like \u201cwe cured X children of autism\u201d and \u201cyou need to stop chemo because Product cures Stage 4 cancer and chemo is really bad for you.\u201d Regulators did step in, and also found that the injection vials at the factory were contaminated.\n\nMy stance on this: I\u2019m glad a regulator stepped in to stop this. The \u201cmedicine\u201d being untested and possibly unsafe, the fact that they\u2019re profiting from desperate people while presumably being aware it is a placebo, it apparently being injected into children by people with no training, the spokesman telling people not to take legitimate and possibly life-saving medication so they will buy his drug instead - all of it makes me feel like getting the law involved was a net good.\n\nThe other party in the discussion claimed to support the company because, \u201cas a libertarian\u201d, in short - people should be allowed to sell a fake medicine, with whatever claims, to whomever they want, and should not be legally bound to produce evidence or meet quality standards (the anecdotes from the spokesman should be enough). \n\nThe thinking being that the government should have a seal or stamp for truly \u201capproved\u201d medicines, people should learn what it means, and then should know they should avoid medicine which doesn\u2019t have it if they want something backed by science. The maker can continue calling it a medicine and profiting from the public without interruption as long as there\u2019s someone uneducated or unwise enough to buy it. \n\n(I doubt the claim that allowing this to happen wouldn\u2019t dramatically increase the amount of fake/unsafe drugs on the market - it offers a very good profit margin.)\n\nDoes this second approach generally fit with the libertarian viewpoint? I\u2019m not hugely familiar with it yet but interested to know more. I appreciate that there\u2019s probably a spectrum of opinion even amongst libertarians.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Libertarian view on fake medicine?"}

{"author":"nekozoshi","created_utc":1516930229,"num_comments":21,"score":0,"selftext":"I figured this would be a good place to ask about Ayn Rand's philosophy. I have a question about what actually makes Objectivism moral, more specifically the ideal morality. \n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but Objectivism states that morality is working towards your own happiness, as long as you don't infringe the rights of others. My confusion about this is mainly that working towards your own, and only your own happiness seems antithetical to most people's concept of morality. Human altruism seems to value helping others, especially at a cost to yourself. I'm a utilitarian, so I'd explain this situation as such: a millionaire giving a poor man $10 is morally good because it causes less suffering to the millionaire to give up $10 than it causes pleasure to the poor man to receive it and feed his family for a night. Rand did not consider charity a virtue, or helping others in desperate need to be a duty. What is the fundamental argument that Objectivism uses to dismiss alturism, and claim selfishness is the most important virtue?\n\nI also have a major problem with how objectivism never seems to define person-hood. It seems like a serious oversight to theorize a morality and never explain who it applies to. You may say \"people of course\" but for a long time slaves, women and many different peoples were not considered \"people\" with any rights, so a clear definition is important. I first thought it was defined by any being that can pursue it's own happiness. The internet says that the ability to reason was her intended standard, but she doesn't advocate harming humans who can't reason (babies, and very mentally impaired humans) and is completely silent on the fact that plenty of animals have some ability to reason (at least better than babies can). This could also lead to the argument that ants or computer systems with the ability to reason and produce things deserve rights. So what actually is Objectivism's definition of person-hood?

The life expectancy in the US is about 12% shorter than in a comparable socialized healthcare country.  In the US the cost of care is about triple that of a socialized country.  Cost of care was about 2.5x higher before the implementation of the ACA.  \n\nSo using the typical metrics of supply and demand - raw amount produced, market clearing price, and the effectiveness of what is produced...the data doesn't support the idea that care is more scarce in socialized countries.  \n\nConservatives and libertarians have a tendency to ignore data.  They see information that contradicts their view, and they'll either a) come up with a reason that it can be discounted or b) perform a kind of 'data transferrence' where they'll claim the exact opposite of what the data shows, and repeatedly shout that analysis at the top of their lungs.  (Great example is Social Security, where Republicans cut the funding to Social Security by 40% and then told us we needed to cut benefits because it was unafforable...after they had cut the funding).  \n\nThis is another great example of that.  My purpose is simply to point out how easy it is to succumb to your ideology when it tells you what you want to hear, and the facts do not.  \n\nSources:  [OECD](https://i.imgur.com/1T7ITq9.png), [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/uninsured/fact-sheet/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Based on the economic facts, despite what is claimed by the right scarcity of care is far higher in the US than it is in countries with universal taxpayer funded coverage."}

What was the reason for raising shovels instead of slinging snow? To answer that, we must go back in time.\n\nThe weather forecasters had predicted rain, followed by ice, and then by snow. Panic was everywhere, which usually means nothing would be the result \u2014 and I had hoped as much. Sure, we might get a little rain and a little ice and snow, but only as minor inconveniences.\n\nHowever, it rained \u2014 a lot. Then the temperature plummeted and ice fell from the sky. Finally, the snow came \u2014 inches. Stores closed and traffic clogged, causing major inconveniences.\n\nOnce it stopped, homeowners ventured out to begin clearing and chipping, hard work, to say the least. As I pushed and tossed snow higher and higher, I noted my neighbor humming, cheerful in his work.\n\nI asked, \u201cWhy all the cheer? Aren\u2019t your arms tired and your back sore?\u201d To which he replied,\u201d Sure, but I am doing great things today. Thank goodness for the ice and snow.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat things? Your shoveling snow and chipping ice \u2014 hard, back-breaking labor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no. If it hadn\u2019t snowed, I would have been doing something less \u2014 caning an old chair, a work of lesser value. So, instead of doing the lesser, I am doing the greater. And I am better off since my labor is devoted to that which I value more, a cleared driveway. I am being more productive and, hence, improving my lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? You lost me.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I value \u2014 and my wife values \u2014 a cleared driveway over the other work I had planned for this weekend. Instead of wasting my time producing lesser value \u2014 caning that old chair, I am devoting my labor to clearing my driveway. So, again, if the snow had passed, as folks like you had hoped, I would be worse off.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorse off?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Your supposed snow disaster is no disaster at all. It is an opportunity for each of us to devote our labor to the better. I mean, you obviously value a cleared driveway over anything else you would have done this weekend. Why else would you be pushing a shovel like me?\u201d\n\nI stopped for a moment to formulate what I hoped was a decent response.\n\nI began, \u201cIf the storm had passed to the north or south as I hoped, your driveway would have remained clear and you would have had your chair caned. But since the storm hit us directly, after your hours of labor and days of recovery, you will only be where you were the morning of the storm. And you are out a caned chair and left with a sore back and tired arms. You are certainly not better off.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you are wrong. Disasters always produce positive results. They allow men and women to devote their labor to activities each value greater than non-disaster alternatives. That is true, regardless of whether the disaster is a hurricane or snowstorm, or something else. I am creating more value today than I would have absent the snow and ice. So I am, without a doubt, better off.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you chair isn\u2019t going to be caned.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do I care? I desire that less than a cleared driveway.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should care. Your driveway would have been clear \u2014 not cleared, but clear \u2014 without the storm. You are focusing on the seen \u2014 your soon-to-be-cleared driveway, all the while ignoring the unseen \u2014 your cane-bare chair. Your whole argument is nothing but sophistry.\u201d\n\nAs noted above, that last word was impetus for his shovel to rise in \u2014 to my perception \u2014 an offensive gesture, followed by mine in a defensive one.\n\nAs we stared at each other, a thought came to me, \u201cSo, assuming I hit you with my shovel and open a wound on your forehead \u2014 a true disaster from your standpoint, I will be giving you the opportunity to redevote your labor, this time to something you value greater \u2014 your health \u2014 than your cleared driveway. I will be doing you a favor, improving your lot. Agreed?\u201d\n\nHe tilted his head for a moment and then quickly lowered his shovel. The smile drained from his face, just as the energy drained from his back and arms. He looked at me and said, \u201cMan, I hate this snow.\u201d","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Keynesians"}

If that same $3.6B could go toward the opioid epidemic, it would save many lives. How many lives will be saved spending the $3.6B on cannabis law enforcement? Zero!, because their lives weren't at risk to begin with. We were headed in the right direction, certainly a long road ahead, but still the right direction.

{"author":"vivere_aut_mori","created_utc":1517213112,"num_comments":42,"score":7,"selftext":"I have been watching Dirty Money on Netflix. The first episode had unfortunate editorializing at the end, but was generally a good look at what Volkswagen did with their defeat devices. The second was a stunningly fair look at Scott Tucker, the man who faced a $1.3 billion judgment, followed by a 16 year prison term (which at his age of 55 is nearly a life sentence). But based on what I saw, he did nothing wrong. The guy saw loopholes in the law, saw consumer demand, and then made a product that met that demand. It says clearly on the first line of the agreement that \"your loan consists of 1 payment of X due at your next paycheck,\" which is not ambiguous at all. \n\nIn my view, the fault of this disaster (if you would call it that) lies on the people who aren't reading binding legal documents that come with loans. It would be like throwing the CEO of my local bank in prison because I didn't know that my 30 year mortgage had to be paid every month for thirty years, in my eyes. \n\nTo quickly brief you on what he did, he essentially set up the businesses as being owned and operated by Indian tribes in Oklahoma. Indian tribes are immune to state laws. By going through the tribe, he avoided state laws. \n\nAt one point, Tucker's racing coach (rightfully, IMO) compares it to racing. In racing, teams frequently race the rulebook. In his words, \"if you're racing and there's a rule book for white drivers that's [a foot thick,] and a rule book for Indian drivers that's [an inch thick,] I'm hiring Indian drivers.\" All Tucker did was follow the idiocy of the rules to its natural conclusion. One set of rules for brown guys, and a tougher set of rules for white guys. He sets the company up through the brown guys, and the government, angry at being made the fool, crucified the guy.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? As a libertarian, I despise this kind of jackbooted thuggery. Near the end, Tucker's attorney sums up my opinion nicely (paraphrasing best I can remember): \"if you want to have a policy discussion on payday lending, fine. You want to have a discussion on the morality of high interest short term loans, fine. But you want to change government policy through criminal prosecutions? You can go to hell.\" I share his sentiment. Don't punish people who were clever enough to beat your laws. \n\nAs a final sidenote, what's your thoughts on payday lending? To me, I see it as yet another \"prohibition never works\" issue. We didn't allow it, so the mafia stepped in. Now we do allow it, and while it is a raw deal for most people, it provides financial options for people who have such poor credit that they would be out of any hope at all otherwise. It has a role, and all Tucker and people like him do is fill that role. If anyone has a problem with it, make your own payday loan company that operates on thinner margins or as a nonprofit. If it really is as corrupt as people think, that wouldn't be hard.

I've long had libertarian/classical liberal sympathies, but I've been getting hung up on an issue relating to privacy and free speech. It started with the [CNN doxxing threat](https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/7/5/15922224/cnn-blackmail-doxxing-hanassholesolo-reddit-wrestling-gif) last year. In case anyone doesn't remember this, CNN figured out the identity of a poster from TD and threatened to reveal his real name. Like a lot of people, I was pretty disturbed by this, but as a believer in free speech, I was uncomfortably aware of a tension between saying \"people shouldn't be allowed to doxx each other\" and also affirming every individual's right to say whatever the hell they want.\n\nThe more I thought about issues of privacy, the more it seemed like it could come into conflict with free speech. For example, I feel pretty uncomfortable about media organisations publishing the name of people arrested for (but not convicted of) crimes, potentially ruining their reputation even if they subsequently acquitted. Similarly, I feel like 'revenge porn' (i.e., nonconsensual public sharing of private nude or sexually explicit images of a person by a former lover/partner) violates an individual's basic liberty. I even have some sympathy for the [right to be forgotten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten), given how our current media age can lead to people having a devastating 'five minutes of infamy' that haunts their future lives.\n\nAnyway, I'm increasingly convinced that there's a good libertarian case for giving priority to privacy over free speech when the two come into conflict (while still holding both to be core principles). Specifically, I think a hallmark of libertarianism is *protecting individual autonomy* and our ability to make our own moral and lifestyle choices. Violations of privacy like those above do indeed encroach on our autonomy: if I know that I'm liable to be doxxed if I express unpopular views online, and that this could compromise my career and reputation, then there are lots of things I might well feel unable to do/say.\n\nInterested to hear people's thoughts.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Which should libertarians value more highly: privacy or free speech?"}

If you were to therefore ask me for 110 dollars in the future instead you aren\u2019t exploiting me. Instead you are acknowledging the fact that you should be compensated for your sacrifice of value in the interim. For this reason a down payment is not exploitation as we shall soon see.\n\nSuppose workers wanted to make a product, let\u2019s say a car and then sell it at full value. Well to do it without any coordination from the capitalist first they would need to make the throughput. They would need to mine the iron (make the tools to mine the iron and other metals), buy the tools to make the car, assemble the engines, paint the car and after all those years, then they could make the full profit of they are even able to sell it.\n\nHowever workers can\u2019t properly sustain themselves that long and would prefer money in the shorter period of time over the longer period. This is where the capitalist comes in. By providing you a wage worth less than the full amount that would occur at the end of the process you aren\u2019t being exploited. You are given the value for your part of the work in acknowledgment that other factors such as throughout and all other forms of labour done before weren\u2019t done by you and needed to be communicated by the capitalist as well as also acknowledging that the process isn\u2019t completed by you in its entirety for that product. \n\nIn turn the capitalist isn\u2019t exploiting you; when he invests and abstains from immediate consumption to do this investment he is allowing you to get a short term wage and compensation which is more ideal than waiting however long you would have to wait to do the entire process.\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"An attempt to tackle the labour theory of value"}

{"author":"RV2115","created_utc":1517364933,"num_comments":14,"score":0,"selftext":"My aim for this post is to try to get to the root of what gives people rights. I will try my best to keep as much opinion out as possible. I would like for everyone to provide every step in their reasoning and a logical argument as to why that reason is valid. I will start off this discussion with my own understanding of rights. \n \n Beforehand, I will go into the history of rights, notably in US government. The start of the idea of rights has, historically, been tied to an objective source, a \"creator\". Gods and Goddesses gave us our traits, behaviors, and, in some cases, our \"rights\". We lived according to what our gods allowed, also what our society allowed. \n\nThese things are always changing over the centuries. So, what rights have withstood the test of time? And does that withstanding make them superior, for lack of a better word, to other \"rights\"? \n\nWell, here I will go into how I will divide the subject of rights. Firstly, I will stop calling them rights and instead, call them privileges. Secondly, I have three categories. \n\nFirst category: includes the immediate bodily privileges. These are extremely hard to obstruct. They include belief, thought, speech, emotion, movement of limbs and other body parts, urination, breathing, defecating, etc. These privileges are needed to survive, develop properly, and be productive. I do not think any civilized person argues against these being vital to society. \n\nSecond category: includes subjective bodily and object privileges. These include privilege to any amount or kind of land, to drinking water, to food, to shelter, to protection against attackers via weapons of some kind, to things you created or grew, some kind of currency you worked for, immediately necessary medical treatment.\n\nThird category: includes subjective social privileges. These include privileges to housing, basic universal income, equal pay, non-discriminatory workplaces, free healthcare, net neutrality, etc. \n\nI do not mean to say any category is more or less valid than any other. I would argue that all categories have no basis in any fact or evidence. All categories are equally valid since none are objectively derived. (That is unless you believe in a creator which gave us these \"rights\", in which case you could point to a definitive source of rights. ) However, just because none are based in objective measurement, experimentation, and calculation, doesn't mean society won't treat them as if they were. \n\nMy conclusion is that rights are simply what society agrees should be allowed behaviors for each of its members. That being true, there is no difference in validity between any form of rule and economy. Totalitarian state socialism is just as respectful of rights, objectively speaking, as a libertarian government. \n\n\nKeep in mind this isn't an argument for or against any system of thought or government, just a thought about rights.

However, I've noticed a lot of anti-liberty sentiment in places. \n\nExample: I frequent two subs that seem to hate libertarians: \n\n1. /r/flying. It's a place frequented mostly by pilots, student pilots and aircraft mechanics. It's a pretty darn cool community, but damn do they love some of the worst FAA regulations. When the FAA shut down Flytenow (an Uber-esque startup aimed at light aircraft owners to rideshare), the sub by and large cheered for that, lest millions of Cessnas start falling from the sky because non-commercial pilots can more easily split their enormous gas bills. I see the regulations cited as major protectionism geared towards incumbent business jet operators, and it's extremely expensive to comply with them in a small prop aircraft with no big money to be made. Many there acknowledge this, but the intention of safety cited by the FAA is enough for them to support such strict rules. \n\n2. r/electricvehicles/. I find the technology fascinating, and hope to buy a second-hand Chevy Bolt in a year or two because the running costs are so cheap and maintenance is so low. However, there's a great deal of progressive activists there who want to outright ban the internal combustion engine, and have no qualms about other severe environmental legislation that would likely grind the economy to a halt. \n\nWhat are some subs where y'all visit that don't take well to the ideas of liberty?
