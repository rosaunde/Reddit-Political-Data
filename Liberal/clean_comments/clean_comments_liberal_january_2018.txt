THC has depressing and pain killing effects similar to opioids. If made legal, it could potentially be a replacement and solve the opioid crisis.\n\nIt has a scary drug taboo and is illegal in many countries. But alcohol is illegal in many places too. Science extend beyond cultural assumptions, and the science is clear on THC compared to other legal substances. \n\nWhy is the GOP against pot? It\u2019s because they need money to win elections. And please a base that prides anti-intellectualism and cultural biases over rationality. The tobacco lobby fears this getting legal and replacing their products.

By every measurable metric, firearm ownership is growing rapidly. Nationally, concealed carry permitting has increased 20-fold in 20 years. In states that require them, FOID application rates are at record highs. 32 of the last 60 months have set record numbers for NICS background checks. \n\nAnd here's the important part: Most (all?) of the \"blue\" states severely restrict conceal carry and gun ownership, so they aren't seeing the concerns of these voters. \n\nThe majority of these 15 million concealed carriers are in populous swing states. Kids who have seen mom and dad safely carry every day are now coming of voting age. Their friends and family trust them more than they trust politicians of any bent. In addition to the single-issue gun owners you had 20 years ago, you've gained another 30 million people with a vested interest in gun ownership. \n\nThen you have the Democratic nominee for president saying things like this:\n\n&gt;\"We\u2019re way out of balance.

The friends and family of these concealed carriers add at least another 15 million, and the kids of the first carriers are now coming of age and are being gifted their first handguns by their concealed carrier parents. \n\nThis is one issue that Democrats cannot afford to be on the wrong side of, and the \"wrong side\" is the position popular in democratic enclaves. \n\nWe need the swing states far more than we need gun control. Abandoning 15 million concealed carriers to the GOP is political suicide. ","created_utc":1515591513,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"spaceghoti","body":"I find it best to always browse Wapo and NYTimes in Privacy/Incognito mode. That way they can't track how many free articles you've read.\n\n&gt; President Trump is now denying that he ever described developing nations as \u201cshithole countries.\u201d But he is acknowledging that he did use \u201ctough\u201d language in the context of the debate over whether to take in people from said shitholes, and in so doing, he is only confirming that the mask has now been torn off for good.\n\n&gt; Multiple TV journalists have flatly declared that Trump has revealed himself as a racist. It\u2019s good that it\u2019s now safe to say this on prime-time television, but we already knew that. What this episode also does is shatter the endless euphemisms and dissembling that Trump and his allies have employed to obscure a related truth: that the nationalism at the core of Trumpism is heavily driven by a reactionary backlash to the current ethnic and racial mix of the U.S. population \u2014 it is white nationalism, despite all the what-me-racist protestation to the contrary.\n\n&gt; Trump\u2019s comments also reveal that this basic truth is shaping the White House\u2019s policy stances in the current immigration debate, something that is also being obscured with all sorts of rhetorical trickery. Trump\u2019s comments have upended the negotiations underway over a deal to protect the \u201cdreamers.\u201d But it can no longer be denied that Trump opposes the deal at least in part because it does not do enough to resist or roll back ongoing racial and demographic trends.\n\n&gt; Consider the particulars of the current immigration talks and Trump\u2019s response to them. In the White House, a bipartisan group of senators yesterday presented an agreement that would grant protected status to the dreamers who were brought here illegally as children, pump more money into border security, tweak family-based immigration and end the \u201cDiversity Visa Lottery Program,\u201d which distributes visas to countries with historically low immigration rates, many in Africa and Central Asia, channeling those visas to some U.S. residents with temporary protected status (TPS) from countries like El Salvador, Nicaragua and Haiti, a program Trump is rolling back.\n\n&gt; Trump reportedly reacted to a discussion of that last component of the deal by saying: \u201cWhy are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?\u201d before suggesting the United States should instead allow in more people from countries like Norway. Trump now claims he only used \u201ctough\u201d language about this deal, but his reported comments illuminate his actual policy stance: Trump is, in fact, rejecting the deal because it lets in too many people from what he thinks are \u201cshithole countries,\u201d or lets too many of them remain.\n\n&gt; Trump objects to the agreement because he claims it makes so-called chain migration (family-based immigration) and the lottery system \u201cworse,\u201d meaning we must take in \u201clarge numbers of people\u201d from \u201chigh crime \u2026 countries which are doing badly.\u201d That openly concedes that Trump wants fewer people from those countries here.\n\n&gt; The meaning of this is plain. Trump has claimed he objects to the lottery program because it admits terrorists, but he still objects to the deal reached on it because it still allows people (those with TPS) from the wrong countries, the \u201cshithole\u201d countries, to remain. He wants more funding for the wall, which is symbolic, yes, but that\u2019s exactly the point: As Frank Sharry of America\u2019s Voice puts it to me, the wall is a \u201cmiddle finger to Latin America,\u201d a statement that \u201cwe don\u2019t want your kind.\u201d It\u2019s a middle finger to shithole countries, but more to the point, it\u2019s a statement that we don\u2019t want the people from them.\n\n&gt; Trump also opposes the current deal because it would restrict family-based immigration (in which current immigrant citizens or permanent residents sponsor relatives for entry) only for the parents of the dreamers and some others, whereas Trump wants much greater reductions in family-based immigration. But as Dara Lind points out, while this debate is complicated, this functionally means large reductions in the numbers of people from countries who already have large immigrant populations here \u2014 which means resisting trends shaping our current ethnic and national mix.\n\n&gt; In light of Trump\u2019s apparent claim that he wants to prioritize people from countries such as Norway, the uglier white nationalist cast of all of this is inescapable. Trump\u2019s fellow travelers have gone to great lengths to obscure this basic reality. In a now-infamous exchange, CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta asked White House immigration hard-liner Stephen Miller whether Trump\u2019s policies are designed \u201cto engineer the racial and ethnic flow of people into this country.\u201d Miller reacted with outrage and repeatedly cast the goal as reducing the mere numbers of immigrants \u2014 ostensibly to protect U.S. workers from competition \u2014 which he said was in keeping with previous periods of lower immigration.\n\n&gt; It is very hard to disentangle the goal of reducing the overall numbers of immigrant arrivals from the goal of shifting our current ethnic and racial mix. But Trump has now left little to no doubt that the real animating impulse is the latter.","created_utc":1515796552,"score":17,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

For example, in the case of the baker who refused to bake a cake for a gay couple, if he had actually read 1 Corinthians 5:9-13 (and understood it) he would never have brought this action in the first place.   In summary:\n\nThere is NO basis for prioritising sexual sin (let alone being gay) for any particular opprobrium over and above other items, such as being greedy, or ripping people off.   \n\nPaul (the author of the text) takes it a step farther and says, basically, that if you want to play this game (\"who am I too holy to associate with?\") then there is no end to it - *everyone* is a sinner and you \"would have to leave this world altogether\" (you would never get out of your front door and nobody entering your shop would be worthy of service).\n\nOne for starters: Couple comes in for their child's birthday cake - he finds out they aren't married - does he not serve them too?....  but I'd be here all day.\n\nRightfully, Paul is more interested in hypocrisy (people within the church who behave badly) with the basic message being \"mind your own business and take care of your own house\" (A timely message wouldn't you think?)\n\nBut within verse 12 lies the rub (and worth breaking my no-all-caps rule, with your indulgence, fellow readers:)\n\n\"WHAT BUSINESS IS IT OF MINE TO JUDGE THOSE OUTSIDE THE CHURCH?  ARE YOU NOT TO JUDGE THOSE INSIDE?  GOD WILL JUDGE THOSE OUTSIDE.\"\n\nHaving got that off my chest, I am far from saying leave your brains at home.  Businesses of all stripes can rightfully say that taking certain business does not align with their values.   Drug companies are refusing to sell pentabarbatol to the US government for use in lethal injection.   Ethical investment funds make choices regarding all kinds of issues.\n\nBut in this case, this is not just discrimination, but hypocrisy of the worst kind.  The baker seems to think God has deputised him to adjudicate on which sins are worse than others.  From there he thinks he can pay out on gays but conveniently take a \"don't ask - don't tell\" policy for everyone else.  \n\nI will go as far as to say - from my experiences from being brought up as an evangelical Christian, that it is a sin not to serve the gay couple.

The country can support those who can't support themselves, but they can't support EVERYONE.  There's more immigrants in this country than ever before in this nation's history, we don't owe the world a thing given our philanthropy.  We're being asked to take in people that their own neighbor countries won't lift a finger to help, and this pressure is being clothed in a sense that we're bad people to not do it, when we do more than anyone else proportionately.  When the President said \"why can't we get anybody from Norway?\" he's talking about maybe bringing in the next Nobel Prize winner or Elon Musk, rather than the next taxi driver.  I know Musk comes from South Africa, but given how that country's going these days, Musk is the rare exception.  Bottom line, it used to be merit that got you into this country, now it's just a test of how brown you are, and you shouldn't be penalized for pointing the obvious out.","created_utc":1516134212,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}
{"author":"MillicentWood","body":"Our president, notorious for random burst tweeting, taking pause at false allegations is fishy. If he truly didn't say it - trust he would have been on Twitter immediately. It's more likely there was a pause because he knows he said it - and wanted to triple check any evidence  (other than hersay) that would contradict what he said. To get all his ducks in a row before out right denying he said it and risk putting his foot in his mouth. The weird pause, IMO, makes me believe he said it more than if he would have just out right said he didn't or went to Twitter ranting like he normally does. Talks about deportation and immigration is a whole different conversation. And we can have that conversation. But if feels misleading to suddenly jump to what he actually said and \"he only said that because.... goes on to talk about immigration\" - I hope I'm not coming across as combative. But a lot of people don't seem to understand the significance of what he (allegedly) said and why it's important despite his intentions. As our most important respresentive of the United States. Literally, the face of the United States on the global platform, why behavior and language is important. Our president, leader, respresentive, should not call Africa a shithole. Ya know what I mean? Regardless of what he was \"trying\" to say - and on a side note: \"trying\" to say something is silly. Are you kidding me? Try harder president. If that is you trying to put together a thought that is really saying a lot you can't rub two brain cells together and have an adult conversation?

I don't know your aunt but I'm willing to believe she's actually a hard worker. But many wealthy people are not like that. Many only parade their face around while everyone else does work in their name.\n\nAdditionally, you have to keep in mind what we're comparing it too. Someone can work a standard workload and be rich, while another person can be working 60 hours a week at multiple, lousy jobs such as dishwashing or custodial work and be making considerably less, barely enough to keep their home and feed their family.\n\nAlso, many middle class people with these attitudes are hypocritical to a degree. They may be working harder and for less than the rich, but they're also working less hard for more than the actual poor.\n\nAnd sure stress plays a factor in the difficulty of a job, but you can't argue that it's comparable to long hours of physical labor and monotonous tasks.\n\nLastly, when a wealthy person gets off work, they can go relax at a sauna, or go out to eat, or just sit at their home that they're not at risk of losing. They can take vacation time without worrying about the lost wages or cost of a motel. They don't have to spend half of their weekends doing maintenance work on their home because they can afford people to do it for them.","created_utc":1516213773,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"djinnisequoia","body":"There was one time on a message board where I was trying to explain to people why racial hate was bad. And I happened to have a story told to me by an older black man I know. When he was in college, he met a young lady, a white woman, and she was the love of his life. They were perfect for each other. But his father didn't like white folks, and talked him into breaking up with her. (there may have been a financial component? I forget.) Now here he was in his sixties, still sad because he felt like he had blown his best chance at real happiness. --So I told this story to the racially-intolerant white folks on the board, thinking maybe the point might get through if the shoe was on the other foot, if they weren't cast as the bad guys in that story. (a lot of white bigots these days have this weird persecution complex) And actually, nobody argued with me over that one. I don't know if I got through or not. You can only try. So, try when you feel strong enough, and remember that every reasonable voice speaking out against what is wrong, is some of the water that turns the tide.

{"author":"unMuggle","body":"The thing is, if you want to reduce the deficit there are several thousand ways of doing it. \nTrump is doing it (well, not doing it) by cutting taxes and programs. It won\u2019t end up working, but in theory you could design a small reach zero program government with minimal taxes and only civil protection. Why the hell you would is anyone\u2019s guess.\nHillary isn\u2019t really something to discuss, her presidency would have looked almost identical to Obama\u2019s but with possibly more identity politics (which is only a bad thing if that is your only politics.)\nBernie would have increased social spending by a huge factor, while also increasing taxes (to everyone but significantly top heavy) and would have fought to decrease military waste. \n\nIn truth and trying to be as fair as possible, how you handle a budget is based on expertise and values and not really policy. If you value low taxes and small government you cut funding and cut taxes. If you value social programs and the like, you raise taxes and raise programs. I would argue one is far more moral, but in raw numbers neither way is better.\n\nNow on to Trump\u2019s plan. I don\u2019t plan on being super specific, but anyone with a calculator and the cliff notes version of the tax plan will tell you that by itself, it will add 10 trillion to our debt in 10 yearsish. You can\u2019t cut taxes on everyone and keep programs, and as of right now his tax plan doesn\u2019t really have significant program cuts, mostly because it\u2019s marketing. They are cutting the taxes first, and slowly cutting the funding afterwards not because of the tax cuts but as Paul Ryan will say \u201cwe just can\u2019t afford it\u201d. If the plan said everyone pays less taxes but fuck your services it would have been less popular than it already was.\n\nTo Bernie\u2019s plan. It\u2019s easy, if you don\u2019t obsess over politics to say and incorrectly mean that you couldn\u2019t pay for M4A and Free College. However, covering everyone under a Universal healthcare system would allow for things like negotiated pricing and drug importation, which would reduce the Federal spending on healthcare by billions every year. And even if you have to raise taxes for free tuition for everyone, long term college educated populations will do better economically.
