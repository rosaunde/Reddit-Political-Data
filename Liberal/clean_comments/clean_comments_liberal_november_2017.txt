That's not really relevant though because comparing the US effective corporate tax rate to the statutory corporate tax rate of other countries doesn't disprove my \"supposition\". According to this [report](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52419) from the CBO, when adjusting to an effective corporate tax rate, the US is still higher than all but three G20 countries (whom consist of about 86% of world GDP). It's not a coincidence that US multinational corporations are increasingly investing and relocating headquarter operations into countries with lower corporate tax rates. Since we are taxing overseas profits (unlike other countries) and taxing a higher average corporate tax rate, US corporations with overseas earnings are increasingly being aquisitioned by foreign firms for tax inversions. US corporations are not going to invest domestically the billions of dollars they've made overseas since the profits would then be subject to a higher tax. Instead, these large profits are more often invested abroad. At one-point, Ireland even peaked in 2015 with a 26.3% spike in GDP growth rate as US corporations were flocking to countries with lower corporate tax rates.","created_utc":1510019307,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"CavalierTunes","body":"&gt;So am I allowed to address the things that Anita has done? She's one of the ones conning us, using us a shield, just like how the misogynists co-opted the Gamergate cause.\n\nThe problem is, every other Gamergater I\u2019ve interacted with has used Anita Sarkeesian as a stand-in for feminism or feminist policies. If you want to link me to an article that discusses Sarkeesian\u2019s actions without dismissing her assertions regarding the negative portrayal of women in videogames have at it. My point is: If you can find a Gamergate-article that isn\u2019t anti-feminist, I\u2019d be glad to read it. But, based on my experience, 99% of Gamergate-articles involve some criticism of Sarkeesian\u2019s feminist views (as opposed to more general criticisms of her actions), and many men they mentioned are criticized for their connection to feminism. \n\n&gt;If you're committed to thinking that Anita did nothing wrong, and I can't defend it without bringing up what people like that have done, then I'm afraid that our views aren't really compatible.\n\nEducate me. In your own words, what horrible thing has Sarkeesian done that doesn\u2019t boil down to \u201cshe\u2019s a feminist.\u201d\n\n&gt;All I'll say is that we're getting too caught up in Left vs Right, such basic tribalism that we're not seeing straight.\n\nTo a certain extent, I agree with you. As an avid supporter of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, I see myself ostracized from certain groups of other liberals very often for not being part of the \u201cClinton-tribe.\u201d  So, yeah, I understand.\n\nI\u2019ve had to repeatedly explain and defend how criticizing Clinton\u2019s policies are not the same thing as sexism. How I don\u2019t trust Corey Booker\u2019s ties to pharmaceutical companies, and how those beliefs aren\u2019t based in racism.  So, let me explain, I understand where you\u2019re coming from: It\u2019s bothersome to have to constantly defend how you\u2019re not misogynist.\n\nBut, at the same time, the catalyst for the Gamergate phenomenon appears to have stemmed not from actual journalistic integrity, but rather a push for a feminist viewpoint in videogames. Criticisms of Sarkeesian almost inevitably fall back on her feminist beliefs.\n\nI can defend my pro-Sanders beliefs with articles that don\u2019t mention Clinton. I can show statements made by Sanders explaining his social policies. But I have never seen a Gamergate article that didn\u2019t, in some fashion, draw its passion from anti-feminism.\n\n&gt;&gt;Surely even you can admit that, assuming your assertion is accurate, the loudest members of the Gamergate group were anti-feminists.\n&gt;Precisely, which is why it's so easy to dismiss all of the other evidence. It's also the reason why every right winger can point at us whenever we deny something blatantly obvious.\n\nPlease provide me with the other evidence. Because I haven\u2019t seen it.\n\n&gt;We're both doing this, the left and right, and it's getting us nowhere.\n\nTo a certain extent, yes.\n\n&gt;Also, thank you very much for being so nice and non-threatening.\n&gt;I expected alot of harassment for going against the group and I'm glad that didn't happen.\n\nWell, I\u2019m always willing to have a rational discussion about a topic. That said, aside from your assertions, I\u2019ve seen no evidence that the Gamergaters are concerned with journalistic integrity as anything more than an afterthought to anti-feminism. Don\u2019t get me wrong: I agree that there\u2019s a problem when certain EA games get positive reviews from IGN (after clearly purchasing said positive reviews).

{"author":"Absobloodylootely","body":"The author posits two theories as to why the US is unique among western nations in this respect. I believe there is a third option that I personally think is more central.\n\nI did my first degree (law) in Europe, where a mandatory course was legal history. A significant chunk was dedicated to the huge impact the Age of Enlightenment had on the criminal justice system. Gradually the courts moved from church run to civilian run. \n\nSubsequently a significant debate was had on what the purpose of criminal justice was. The outcome of that debate was that the focus shifted away from punishment (especially punishment of amoral behavior) to serving the best interests of society by focusing on prevention and rehabilitation.\n\nYears later, after having returned to the US, I met a leading philosophy professor and asked him why the US criminal justice system still seemed so focused on punishment, and hadn't evolved like European courts to primarily focus on prevention and rehabilitation. He answered that the US had never had a full reception of the Age of Enlightenment philosophy. Yes, when it came to establishing the Constitution the founding fathers primarily relied on AoE philosophers. But beyond this limited domain where the tools of AoE were deployed the philosophy itself and the tools it generated were never really taken onboard.\n\nI would argue that if one views the criminal justice system primarily as a tool for meting out punishment then capital punishment isn't surprising. Conversely if one views the criminal justice system primarily as a tool of prevention and rehabilitation capital punishment doesn't make sense.\n\nIt is also notable that the one source that the article is premised on is the US Constitution - the one example of Age of Enlightenment thinking implemented in the US.","created_utc":1511038082,"score":3,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"bubba-natep","body":"So yeah, this scares the shit out of me: \n\n&gt;Enter the next element of the court-packing turducken: a new plan written by the crafty co-founder of the Federalist Society, Steven Calabresi. In a paper that deserves credit for its transparency (it features a section titled \u201cUndoing President Barack Obama\u2019s Judicial Legacy\u201d), Calabresi proposes to pack the federal courts with a \u201cminimum\u201d of 260 \u2014 and possibly as many as 447 \u2014 newly created judicial positions. Under this plan, the 228-year-old federal judiciary would increase \u2014 in a single year \u2014 by 30 to 50 percent.\n\n&gt;Almost overnight, the judicial branch would come to consist of almost equal parts judges picked by nine presidents combined \u2014 Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush 41, Clinton, Bush 43 and Obama \u2014 and judges picked by one: Donald J. Trump. The effect on our civil rights and liberties would be astounding. And a continuation of the pattern of Trump\u2019s nominees to date \u2014 more white and more male than any president\u2019s in nearly 30 years \u2014 would roll back decades of progress in judicial diversity.\n\n&gt;But even that isn\u2019t enough for the Turducken Court Packers. They have jammed one more \u201ctreat\u201d inside this turkey.\n\n&gt;Calabresi has also proposed that Congress abolish 158 administrative law judgeships in federal regulatory agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, Food and Drug Administration, Federal Communications Commission, and Securities and Exchange Commission, and replace these impartial fact-finders with a new corps of 158 Trump-selected judges who \u2014 unlike current administrative law judges \u2014 would serve for life.\n\n&gt;These new Trump administrative law judges would have vast power over environmental, health and safety, fair competition, communications, labor, financial and consumer regulation for decades. Unlike the existing administrative law judges, selected as nonpartisan members of the civil service, Calabresi\u2019s replacement corps would all be picked in a single year, by a single man: Donald J. Trump.\n\n&gt;And if this breathtaking transformation of our federal judicial system isn\u2019t jarring enough, Calabresi has one final treat: a proposal that Congress do all of this in the tax-cut bill that Congress is trying to pass before it leaves for the holidays.\n\n","created_utc":1511318942,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

I have seen so much horseshit in defense of Moore that is just complete non sequitur. I've seen people say \"so what if Roy Moore fucked a 14 year old, Harvey Weinstein is a serial sexual assaulter who took advantage of his position of power,\" which, yes, he was and did. He was also unanimously rebuked by society at large and he lost his ludicrously high-end career over those accusations. And regardless of any of that, none of it has anything to do with the fact that Roy Moore fucked a kid. Even if Weinstein or any of these other percieved liberals (who, again, are not holding political office or running for the fucking Senate) went unscathed in spite of their ousted history of sexual misconduct (kind of like President Trump has, despite having more accusers than Weinstein and a fucking history of openly admitting to said sexually aggressive behavior up to and including a fucking recording of him boasting about freely sexually assaulting women and encouraging Billy Bush to \"grab them by the pussy\", but I digress), none of that would have ANY bearing on the fact that ROY MOORE is an accused pedophile who is RUNNING for a SENATE SEAT. The pertinent case concerns nothing and no one but Roy fucking Moore, and any whataboutisms concerning liberals like Kevin Spacey committing similar misconduct is just a distraction from the actual discussion concerning Moore and his run for the Senate. \n\nAnd another reason why your right wing propaganda is bullshit is that they'll straight up lie and make shit up, or spread conspiracy theories like that one concerning the fake secret pedophile ring in the nonexistent basement of that pizza place.

He worked for a major U.S. manufacturing corporation for over 40 years. It went bankrupt and out of business a couple of years after his retirement.  He had a number of health issues, most related to his employment, and the health care he'd worked more than 40 years to earn was gone in the blink of a lawyer's eye.  He was spending more than $2000 a month in insurance premiums just to cover himself.  \n\nHe did everything \"the right way\" and still got screwed over. That's when I started thinking there had to be a better way.  Looking at those nations that have single-payer- like Germany, the UK, France- it's painfully obvious that there are.","created_utc":1511771809,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

A president needs to be level headed, have the ability to understand and seek out sources from all angles. Trump hasn't demonstrated that at all, and he blames everyone except for himself for the problems. Combine that with horrible people going into positions (I.E nearly everyone he has appointed either has no experience or did what they could to fight/remove the industry) and you have someone that just doesn't give a damn. \n\nIf he didn't have the letter \"R\" next to his name, then many people would that support him, would hate him, but their love of the party is much more then actual qualifications.\n\n2.) Yes, extremists are hated by me, but I also hate the people that have the thought that \"you have no right to be how you are\". Why people think that they have authority over your existence is sickening, and (some) would kill their own children just because of something that no one has control over. That's scary that people are so screwed up to think that way. My father thought that way.  \n\n3.) Liberal, same as Conservative, Libertarian, etc. all boils down to what you believe is best for a nation and people at large. That brings in a whole bunch of outside influence, whether it be cultural, religious, education, bias etc and are all based more or less on opinion. Do you agree with what the Conservatives say about x, x, and x? Then you can do so, do you agree with Liberals about x,x and x? Then you can do the same. I agree with more liberal policies since it makes much more sense and has a greater chance (through example) of working depending on the issue. \n\nThe way that I've seen it, is that Liberal tends to be much more progressive in nature while Conservative is much more traditional and reluctant to change. However, through-out history, change is inevitable and you cannot go back-wards in history (even though some policies instituted by the Trump administration is attempting that). So why not realize that change is going to happen and embrace it? \n\n4.) Why do you ask the question as that? Being a liberal doesn't mean anti-capitalist, nor does being liberal mean that you fall into line with the \"left\" party. If you have a system that is left un-regulated to a large extent then you'll have it exploited by people, and in the case of capitalism what does that get you? It's get a large section of wealth (and in turn, massive influence) to a select group of people and it's apparent now. If those individuals want a large section of the population to never have a good day in their lives they can do that, and that is very scary to think about. Can a better economic system be implemented? Likely not, but you can form and regulate a system that at the very least lessens the control that others have over the system, it'd be better if the general population collectively had a large amount of power to influence these large businesses, and the ability for start-ups to actually be a source of competition. \n\nIf you have any more questions I'll answer them when I have a chance.\n\nCheers","created_utc":1512071825,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}
