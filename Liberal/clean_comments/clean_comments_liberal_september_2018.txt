{"author":"DeadHonor","body":"I can see why you have such disdain for Peterson. I have listened to his entire YouTube collection and read Maps of Meaning. At first, I was in the same boat as you. Upon further investigation, I found that he is balanced and very well educated, although you do have a point about him being a bit of an alarmist. His study of totalitarianism may have much to do with his supposed \"threatened and oppressed\" stance. I did not view it that way, but I can see how some might. He is merely shining a very bright light on warning signs of a totalitarian left. \n\nFrom the link you provided:\n\n\"The Supreme Court has also found that some limits on free speech are justifiable to protect people from harassment and discrimination in social areas like employment and services.[3]\u00a0On the other hand, decision-makers have said that freedom of expression is much less likely to be limited in the context of a public debate on social, political or religious issues in a university or a newspaper.[4]\n\nIn situations where equality rights and freedom of expression must be balanced, context is critical.[5]\u00a0The words that are chosen matter: the more harmful the words, the further they are from the core values of freedom of expression.[6]\u00a0Other important considerations are the vulnerability of the group affected by the speech, and the degree of impact on their ability to access employment, services and housing on an equal basis.[7]\"\n\nThis is what I have a problem with. Who decides on the context or what expressions are balanced? You say the bar has been high, but that bar can get lower and lower depending on who is in power. That makes me uneasy. \n\nOf course word choice matters, but who decides which are harmful, why, and to what degree? \n\nIs it wise to put these decisions in the hands of force? Yes, laws are interpreted and that is how the legal system works, but what can be interpreted should be limited as much as possible. This is what makes our legal system pragmatic. \n\nHate is too large a term to be interpreted by lawyers. I am against hate-speech laws as well as compelled speech. \n\nI do not believe government should restrict speech.\n\nLibel and defamation laws are different in that they are punishing falsehood. They walk a fine line and it can be clearly interpreted in most cases.\n\nI believe society and culture must decide what is hateful speech and put a stop to it on its own. I do not call my ceo \"sir\" because the law compels me to. Nor do I refrain from calling him \"Mr. Stick-in-the-ass\" because I fear the law (even though there is no law against it). I refrain from doing so for a myriad of reasons that do not require force from the government.\n\nI understand that the west is a culture based on the individual, and subsequently the laws that protect the individual, but I would argue that at the foundation of individual sovereignty is mutual trust and respect for each other as such. Laws are secondary to that foundation and meant to protect against psychopaths who do not understand that identity is not tyranny of self, but instead a mutually agreed upon existence based on the interdependent trust and goodwill of the people; society and culture. \n\nI am who I am only in part because of who I decide to be. You, along with the rest of my community, must also accept, agree, and cooperate with my identity for it to become recognized as sovereign and real. This is a fluid relationship that constantly evolves as I and society develop together. I cannot use force to bend your will and accept my identity. Society should not do so either.\n\nBut here's the difference between my influence on society's cooperation with whatever identity I choose, and its influence on me:\n\nEach of us live a fraction of what our cultures and societies have already lived through. We can only learn so much as individuals and so must heavily rely on culture and society to shape us. \n\nOf course, when we look back at past cultures or stages of our own culture, we gasp and gag at the seemingly obvious errors of our ancestors. Much blood has been shed in the name of progress and liberal thought. But the direction has always been, and should always be, away from tyrannical force. This is why liberalism will never die.\n\nYou can argue that the laws from the Civil Rights movement, anti-discrimination\/anti-hate-speech, are the champions that changed our society for the better. I am certain they helped in many ways. I would argue that the non-violent, peaceful protests of those thousands of brave souls were the strongest and (ever) lasting champions of change; that even without the laws, the people would have continued to change and progress. \n\nThose same laws have evolved (ex. affirmative action) and are now being interpreted in ways that are detrimental to the original cause. Democrats are slowly (or rapidly, depending how you see it) becoming more and more illiberal. They are leaning more and more on force to employ their ideals. \n\nForce is not the answer. This is why I am strongly against Canada's adoption of compelled speech laws. I understand WHY they did it. I sympathize completely with transgender suffering. But they must negotiate their place in society just as every individual must. I acknowledge their fight is much, much tougher. Still, force should not be turned to without serious consideration for the future repercussions. \n\nBTW, I'm sorry for being a bit aggressive at first. I thought \"crock of shit\" was a bit ignorant. I've read hit-piece after hit-piece on Jordan Peterson that really made me lose respect for many left leaning outlets. \n\n\n\n","created_utc":1535763688,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Employers will do whatever it takes to make money.  Passing new laws just makes them more creative.  The only way to keep them honest, is to create a market that MAKES them honest.  Every business must bend the knee to the budget.  Government restriction isn't how you create growth.  Curbing environmental issues, yes.  Ensuring public safety, yes.  Standing army, stable currency, public health, yes.  Government should have a small presence in ones life, but an important one.\n\nI'm perfectly open to dialogue, but not lectures.  Yeah, I live in Oklahoma.  Yeah, I eat meat.  It seems the biggest voices out there are in SoCal trying to tell me how to live my life when their lifestyle destroyed their own cities.  I refuse to listen to someone who values a chicken over an unborn human, who chooses to disarm others rather than learn to defend themselves with the pretense of 'safety', and insists on rights without responsibilities.  We recognize that government's can go sour and remember those lessons well.  The reason we keep firearms is to defend against tyranny, not our neighbors.  And that's exactly it.  If Trump or any government over us DOES go rogue or whatever, there are over 40 million rifles waiting to remind them why.  All other ways will be exhausted first, yes.  Plenty of safeguards in place in our government to keep tyranny at bay.  But we saw Venezuela.  We watched Germany under the Reich.  We will hopefully not follow.","created_utc":1535894368,"score":-3,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"UserN-me","body":"I always knew favoring authoritarianism is a core element of being a conservative. Militant nationalism is also an extension of this as well. \nIt is likely due to the religious upbringing. One of the key components of religion is the disciplined teachings, seeing progressive \u201cfree\u201d thinking, such as the arts, the press, etc. as dangerous. This isn\u2019t strictly an evangelical thing, it\u2019s evident in all modern religions, it\u2019s essential for the religion to \u201cwork\u201d. Outside influence weakens the bond with that religion and their believer. Therefore anything outside the religion is a threat, this is why liberal ideologies cannot be accepted amongst the right. \n\n\u201cTolerance\u201d of others to include ethnic, cultural, and religious groups would weaken their own faith on a communal level. \u201cLiberals\u201d see a diverse group of people who can function independently on a cultural level but maintain the peace as mutually beneficial. Conservative ultimately believe this isn\u2019t possible, that we are incapable of social harmony and suppressing the underlying tension is delaying the inevitable, so we must either force others to assimilate or have them removed.  \n\nSo the end result is the primary divide between the right and left in America is the Evangelical faith or at least the stricter adherence to it. Often Christian teachings are the fundamental purpose for much of the rights desired laws. \n\nSo America isn\u2019t any different than every other nation where religious divide is often the primary driver of conflict. \n\nThey see Trump as the fire and brimstone pastor, the anger, the threats, the \u201cabove the law \u201c(higher purpose and power) approach for himself and his mission while strongly enforcing all laws seen as authoritarian in nature, this is exactly why they voted for him.

It\u2019s eating up the countryside in a seemingly infinite pattern of Lennar Homes, shiny new Rosses, a bunch of Walmarts &amp; Red Lobsters. *Where the fuck does this train stop??????* We\u2019re in a weird holding pattern economically the way I see it very clearly illustrated by the very static nature of our building patterns. \u201cThe powers that Be\u201d are greasing all the right elbows so the people who were making big bucks 50 years ago are STILL making the big bucks now, and will 50 years from now- in America, on the backs of the globally coveted American consumer.\n\nIndia\u2019s gonna be opening it\u2019s first high speed rail soon. China\u2019s got a massive system under way. Obama &amp; Biden had a proposal &amp; Republican governors were having NONE of that. I guess \u201cProgressive\u201d &amp; Exxon Mobile don\u2019t have as many hands in the rupee pot for some reason. So what we have here doesn\u2019t have much to do with capitalism anyway by now. It does have everything to do with greed &amp; a massively disfunctional system perverted into a wealth extraction machine by money-changers who don\u2019t want to let new things ever happen, bc the same ol\u2019 is getting their dick SOAKED at this point.","created_utc":1535988251,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"Zemrude","body":"I definitely didn't mean to suggest that Kaepernick is the only black person protesting, and I'm sure we can both think of many other people participating in protests about this issue.\n\nI am also confident most black protesters would love it if their concerns about their personal safety were not divisive.  But it seems to me that there is a difference between an issue not being divisive because everyone is in agreement, and an issue not being divisive because most people aren't paying attention to it.  And quite simply, politics and political discussion are how we ultimately move from division into agreement.\n\nIf you will permit me to diverge a bit, I think I can explain using a less currently divisive example.  Many US soldiers returned from the first world war with shell shock and\/or physical injuries that limited their ability to find employment.  Our veterans had sacrificed far more, on average, than just their years of active service.  The US government passed a bill in 1924, authorizing a bonus payment to each WWI veteran or their surviving family.  But there was a catch\u2026most veterans couldn't actually receive their payment until 1945.\n\nBy the great depression many WWI veterans were desperate, feeling that they had given an enormous amount for their country and were simply being ignored in return.  So they formed a group, called The Bonus Army, and marched on DC in 1932 in order to demand the immediate payment of their bonus from 1924.  They installed themselves in public spaces, including in front of the Capitol Building, and made their protest visible to everyone passing by, day after day.  This was *hugely* divisive, with one side opposing the taxes needed in order to pay for veterans benefits, and saying that the government had already paid everything owed to the veterans and more.  In addition, many people thought that it had been a mistake for the US to enter WWI, and so (as would be seen again with Vietnam) the veterans were often mistreated and blamed for the larger unpopular war.  Veterans agitating for the bonus and\/or government employment programs were called communists and criminals, and people called for them to be forcibly removed.\n\nThe issue only became more divisive when violence erupted between the march and the DC police.  Two veterans were shot and killed by the police, and in response president Hoover ordered the US Army to clear the protesters from public spaces.  Infantry, cavalry, and six tanks charged into the protest camps.  At least 55 veterans were injured and the 12-week old child of one veteran was killed.  The Bonus Army dispersed, having failed to achieve its immediate objectives.\n\nThis event did, however, get a lot of newspaper coverage.  Ultimately the Bonus Army got people talking about this issue, and forced the public to pay attention to the suffering of veterans.  The issue went from \"most people aren't paying attention to it\" to \"divisive political issue\".  Both protests and political discourse continued over the years while people argued about whether we as a nation owed anything to our veterans after they returned from service.  Hollywood produced a major movie about the treatment of veterans.  Newspapers ran op-eds from both sides.  People disagreed, but they were treating it as a problem to address, rather than something to ignore until it went away.\n\nUltimately the country's attitude shifted, and after years of waiting for Hoover's austerity policies to work, people began to be more accepting of government support and employment programs.  Consensus formed, and in 1936 a bill was passed authorizing the immediate payment of the bonus.  And this consensus became the basis for the 1944 GI Bill, establishing ongoing benefits for existing and future veterans.\n\nToday, we still argue over how to best support our veterans and how to pay for it, but we as a society pretty much agree that we owe our veterans support when they return from service.  And that agreement emerged in the 1930's as the direct result of people forcing a divisive issue into the public eye.\n\nTaking that example as a metaphor, I can see how a group of people whose problems seem to be ignored today might choose to risk making their issue into a divisive one, in the hope that consensus will eventually emerge and it will become non-divisive\u2026not because we aren't thinking about it, but because we have actually agreed to address the issue.\n\nDoes that make sense to you?","created_utc":1536179512,"score":0,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Looking back, I did get a bit wordy and pedantic, it's a fault of mine that often comes out when I am just trying to work things through carefully for my own benefit.\n\nI tend to divide the idea of racism into two categories, because I find it useful to distinguish between personal animosity type racism (i.e. someone who thinks black people are inferior or actively hates them for their race) and racial bias (what a lot of people call institutional racism) where both individuals and systems can - without requiring particular intent or animosity - behave in ways that tend to harm people of certain races.\n\nMy overall impression is probably reasonably compatible with yours.  I don't see some large conspiracy, and I suspect the vast majority of officers aren't personal animosity style racists.  I have seen some numbers that make me think law enforcement is still, overall, acting in a way that disproportionately harms black people and leaving them with at least reasonable cause to fear for their safety in police encounters.  But those larger biases can emerge out of simple factors like poor training.\n\nFor example (and I promise this one will be shorter), if an officer who lives in a mostly white suburb is sent every day to deal with active crimes in a mostly black neighborhood, then statistically a lot of the black people they see and interact with on a day to day basis will be criminals, even if the vast majority of people in that neighborhood are peaceful and law abiding.  The human mind is going to notice that pattern, and it's often going to take some active training or other measures to keep officers from developing a bias and treating all black people as likely criminals.  I don't think it makes that officer an intrinsically bad person, but I do think officers, police forces, and our society as a whole should put in some work to correct those tendencies so they stop contributing to bad outcomes, like unarmed suspects being needlessly killed.\n\nI know some people disagree with me about the extent of the problem, where to place blame, and the best solutions, and there is definitely room for reasonable people to do so.  I think reasonably disagreeing on and discussing these aspects of the problem are important parts of figuring out how to solve it.  I wish I knew better how to deal with people who are unreasonable, but I suspect that the solution is in part not allowing them to shut down the reasonable conversation.\n\nThat may be why I am personally less bothered by the protests.  It seems that many minorities in the US are used to having their problems ignored by default, and people being killed is an urgent problem.  I can see where protesters are coming from when they feel like they have to really work to make sure other people keep paying attention and talking about police brutality.  And by that metric, their tactics do seem to be working.  I just hope I'm right about that being a path to a solution.","created_utc":1536343489,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Reverence for one's own sacred things--parents, religion, flag, laws and respect for one's own beliefs--these are feelings which we cannot even help.

You can't revere his gods or his politics, and no one expects you to do that, but you could respect his belief in them if you tried hard enough; and you could respect him, too, if you tried hard enough. But it is very, very difficult; it is next to impossible, and so we hardly ever try. If the man doesn't believe as we do, we say he is a crank, and that settles it. I mean it does nowadays, because we can't burn him. \n\nAlso:\n\n&gt; We despise all reverences and all objects of reverence which are outside the pale of our list of sacred things.

It's dangerous because of the potential effects.\n\nPut this man on the Supreme Court, repeal Roe v Wade despite scientific evidence, statistics, and the overall viewpoint of the population, and you go back to women performing illegal abortions. *That kills women.* Now, maybe you're a man and so you don't take that to value, but birth control methods even when *taken correctly are never 100% guaranteed.* Unintentional pregnancies happen. Abortions are going to happen. Take away medically safe abortions that women should be entitled to, *women are going to do it out of necessarity.*\n\nAsking no one to ever go through an abortion and carry a child fullterm because \"abortion is murder\" is unrealistic (despite I think that's a load of horseshit). Here's why I'm personally terrified. I have an IUD. It's supposed to work, but again, they're not always 100% effective. But god damn if it would fail, I'm on a cocktail of medications that will give a child birth defects. Right now I'm getting treatments that require me to change *nothing* with my medications for it to work. But nothing is really working that well.\n\nSay despite in all of this chaos, I somehow become pregnant. What do I do? Stop all of these medications that are very hard to stop and pull the plug on my treatments for a month (if you can do them at all during pregnancy), or illegally abort the child if Roe v Wade is overturned? \n\nKeep in mind that (A) these medications are for severe depression so bad I chronically think about killing myself and literally keep me functioning and (B) not everyone is bound to a \"moral thinking\" that life starts when a sperm merges with an egg because I don't believe a cluster of snot is capable of sentience.\n\nAnd thing is, I probably should be considering other birth control methods as my therapist pointed out my hormones may be worsening my already-drastic mood swings, but now we have proof that we're even looking at the possibility of taking away birth control. No matter what happens, I have at least 4 years of semi-reliable protection they literally have to yank out of me.\n\nAnd that just shows **he wants control over the laws regulating women,** *not* that he cares about abortion\/\"murder.\" Since it is completely counterproductive to take away birth control when you're trying to reduce the rate of \"murder.\" But that's not the concern so of course that's not his reason. \n\nLet's put it this way: men will never know the burden of being **forced against their will** to carry a child physically for 9 months, and financially not just in the medical bills for the pregnancy but in child care and emotionally *for the rest of their lives.* Men **always** will be able to walk away despite how much of the share of the blame they share. They have **100% chance of not becoming pregnant even without birth control.**\n\nNot dangerous? For the first time, I had to take a break from the news because *I am terrified.* I'm disgusted and angry but the fact that swing voters aren't concerned literally could be life or death if the stars align just right because *they're gonna ram the fuck face despite he has no place being there.*\n\nHe is indeed, dangerous.\n\nEdit: I'm not even looking for civil debate.

Rather than the predicted **massive inflation** there was.... **none** or lower than normal inflation.\n\nThe dollar is a fiat, global reserve currency that can be converted into any other currency at will.  \n\nPrinting money does not dilute the dollar by (value printed\/gdp), or even (value printed\/total wealth of the US) but it dilutes the dollar by (value printed\/total wealth of the globe).\n\nSo zeroing out the debt owed to China by inventing dollars would have an inflationary pressure of something like $1.2T\/$241T or about .4%.  Not that China would allow us to do that, China's economy depends on owing the US money to keep the value of their currency low.\n\n\nFeel free to try to change my view..","created_utc":1536702409,"score":-5,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

That's not how it works.  Big businesses have proven throughout our history that they will choose profit over the good of the American people, and so laws had to be created that kept them from treating us like animals to be sacrificed at the altar of personal wealth.  \n\n&gt;There's no free market for supply and demand.\n\nThere is no such thing as a \"free\" market.  There never has been, and never will be.  Markets do not exist in nature.  They are man-made creations and will always be subject to SOMEONE controlling them.  Do you honestly believe that if all business regulations were stripped away that greedy corporations would stop trying to manipulate the economy? If so, you're a fool.  If anything, you'd get one large corporation controlling each of the products \/ services there are to offer.  Or have you forgotten the fact that we had to have laws put in place to ban monopolies? \n\n&gt;the solution is to use guns\n\nOh come off it with the guns thing.  Laws exist so that society can function.  This weird delusion that there are armed military personnel marching in the streets shooting business owners who break the law is ridiculous.  \n\n&gt;How is that more freedom?\n\nI think the mistake you're making is believing that freedom can or even should be absolute.  We have never had a single uninhibited freedom in this country.  All of our rights are subject to regulation, and they should be.  Uninhibited freedom leads to chaos and a survival of the fittest society, where the weak are turned into slaves. We evolved out of that as a species, and I'm pretty sure only the naive and ignorant want to go back to that.  \n\n&gt;But you want to use guns of the gov't to force me to provide services against my will?\n\nNobody forces anyone to go into businesses. What you want is for people to go into business then shuck all the laws and do whatever the fuck they want with no consequences if they hurt individuals or even society as a whole.  If a person doesn't want to follow business laws then they shouldn't open a business.  It's really that simple.  There is no force involved.  \n\n&gt;IN the name of freedom?\n\nIf by freedom, you mean the right to hurt people, defraud them, rip them off, and deny a service that they are paying for, then no, you shouldn't and don't have that freedom.

Extreme Narcissism like Trump's has many traits  similar to a psychopath's profile.\n\nMRI's show a lack of emotional brain response to people pictures  depicting , joy, love, distress or pain. These sorts of people cannot identify with your feelings. They are born that way.\n\nAlso, both types consistently report that they have never felt the  feelings of guilt or shame or love (they can like or admire someone, but  only if  a 10. LOL). They do not understand what normal people are talking  about when they say they feel guilty and shameful or are madly in love.  It confuses them concerning how others behave with these feelings. Both  types are tone deaf and do not behave in sociably acceptable ways to  things like death and violence.\n\nBoth types know right from wrong, but have no internal moral compass  to impede them from doing what is wrong other than the self-preservation  urge to not get caught and punished.\n\nYou could say that these types of people truly are inhuman and capable of committing atrocious acts against real feeling humans.\n\nNote: One difference between Trump and a psychopath is Trump's ego can be hurt. As a narcissist, his ego has huge feelings of superiority and you will hurt his feelings (ego) if you attack him personally. A psychopath really does not care about his ego so long as you are not impeding his wants and desires.","created_utc":1536780167,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"EdVaguelyJr","body":"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2018\/9\/7\/17829320\/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-hearing-perjury\n\nMiriam Baer, law professor, Brooklyn Law School Neither of these two cases meet the high bar for a perjury prosecution.\n\nThe first instance, wherein Kavanaugh said he was \u201cnot involved in handling\u201d Pryor\u2019s nomination, isn\u2019t even clearly \u201cfalse.\u201d The question that precedes it is a lengthy question from Senator Kennedy. One could argue that Kavanaugh thought Kennedy was asking whether Kavanaugh played a major role \u201cin the vetting process\u201d for Pryor, or discussed specific Constitutional doctrines with Pryor prior to Pryor\u2019s nomination (Kennedy mentions Pryor\u2019s reported views of the Supreme Court\u2019s Miranda decision). Thus, Kavanaugh\u2019s answer (\u201cNo. I was not involved in handling his nomination\u201d) is truthful insofar as Kavanaugh understood \u201chandling\u201d to mean \u201cin charge\u201d of either vetting the person or shepherding that person\u2019s nomination through the Senate. The fact that Kavanaugh apparently was invited to a meeting (and it is unclear from the email how many other people were invited) doesn\u2019t necessarily demonstrate that Kavanaugh\u2019s statement was untrue, much less that he intentionally lied or misled Senator Kennedy.\n\nI don\u2019t see any lie in [the second case]. Instead, he\u2019s effectively saying, \u201cBased on my own response, I don\u2019t think I realized this was a stolen draft.\u201d\n\nThat being said, senators are free to point out inconsistencies in testimony and question a judicial nominee about those perceived inconsistencies. And if the nominee does a poor job explaining such inconsistencies, senators can and should take that into account. But perjury is a serious crime, provable only by evidence that someone intentionally lied under oath. Based on what I have read so far, I cannot imagine any prosecutor pursuing either of these.\n\nJessica Levinson, law professor, Loyola Law School\n\nProbably not. Perjury is a pretty high standard and it\u2019s not, \u201cWe think you lied, this isn\u2019t particularly credible.\u201d It\u2019s, \u201cYou willfully lied under oath.\u201d It doesn\u2019t feel totally credible, but we don\u2019t have proof of a willful falsehood.\n\nOn the first tweet, being involved in the nomination, I think if you look down lower at the transcript below the part highlighted, he gives himself enough room that it doesn\u2019t clearly rise to the level of perjury. He\u2019s saying, \u201cI know him, I\u2019ve met him, but I wasn\u2019t the point person for that one, I wasn\u2019t in charge.\u201d I think if you look at the overall context, he has a line that he wasn\u2019t involved in the handling. That was probably too direct an assertion, but I don\u2019t think that one rises to the level of perjury.\n\nOn the second one about the documents, that one is a little bit more nefarious or troubling, and I think what Senator Leahy said at the end of that thread is where I come down. Is that really credible? It doesn\u2019t sound right to me. But again, does it rise to the high level of perjury? Can you leap over that threshold or cross that hurdle? I don\u2019t think so. I think the second instance is a closer call, but if you look at the context, if you look at his statements, I think he left himself enough room.\n\nIn sum, do I think future Justice Kavanaugh perjured himself? I don\u2019t. Do I think he\u2019s been less than forthcoming? Absolutely. Do I think he\u2019s been more troublingly less than forthcoming than previous nominees? I do. Do I think we have less access to documents than we have with previous nominees? Yes. But I don\u2019t think that he perjured himself.\n\nCiara Torres-Spelliscy, law professor, Stetson University\n\nIf federal prosecutors are really going after lying to Congress, that could open up an entirely new front of liability for lots of less than truthful witnesses. I doubt anyone at DOJ would have the moxie to go after Judge Kavanaugh for these statements. Whether as a circuit judge or if he gets elevated to the Supreme Court, the remedy to remove him is through the impeachment process, and I don\u2019t see Congress having the stomach for that either.\n\nMark Tushnet, law professor, Harvard University\n\nI\u2019d have to know more detail about both what the documents say and about precisely what Kavanaugh said to be able to make a judgment. But \u201csuggests the contrary\u201d would be a rather feeble basis for a perjury charge.","created_utc":1536855230,"score":3,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"whenthereisfire","body":"Hey I think I can provide some clarification here! I'm currently working a $27 million FEMA funded grant in Florida to provide case management for those who are still displaced or have damage resulting from Hurricane Irma. Puerto Rico is getting a similar grant (the dollar amount will likely be different since it is based on the number of affected households, damage sustained, etc.) and they are in the process of getting it up and running currently. FEMA is pulling out their direct assistance (like hotel rooms and trailers) since it has now been a year since the storms happened, and local community organizations and businesses are picking up where they left off. Most counties here in Florida have at least one Long Term Recovery Group, and organizations like the Red Cross, Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, and Habitat for Humanity are also providing ongoing assistance. Puerto Rico will also be developing these kinds of recovery groups to provide further mitigation.\n\nObviously this grant has been needed for a year now and the fact that it is only now filling positions is an issue, but these people have not been forgotten about, at least by their community recovery groups and these national non-profit organizations. FEMA is currently turning their resources to the Carolinas in the wake of Hurricane Florence, and their solution to halting direct response is the funding of these grants. Millions of people applied for FEMA assistance after the 2017 hurricane season, and the bulk of them have been able to have some form of recovery. Many families who evacuated to Florida from Puerto Rico have found permanent housing here. Unfortunately these 987 families are not in that same position, but I think it's worth noting that there has been significant work happening over the past year and communities are dedicated to continuing to provide aid until full recovery is made.\n\nETA: I think a big obstacle is that people aren't aware of what assistance is available to them. These families likely qualify for assistance but don't know about it or how to access it. FEMA is a federal organization and doesn't have a ton of contact with local community assistance groups, and they also don't provide long-term case management, so if their only contact has been with FEMA they aren't being told about the options that are out there.","created_utc":1536939143,"score":6,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

He's not trying to \"win.\" He's not running for office, he's not suing the president. He was tasked with finding the truth and bringing criminals to justice. I'm not trying to say that Trump is innocent but who is \"winning\" and \"losing\" shouldn't really be the bar here. That sounds like something Trump would say - that this is a zero sum game, there are winners and losers.\n\nShouldn't the point be for Mueller to hold everyone accountable for their actions and, in that way, only persecute Trump to the extent that he is guilty? I mean sure, it feels good to say that he would totally be impeached and\/or arrested for his crimes (and trust me, I do believe he has committed them), but wouldn't that be a \"loss\" for our whole country?\n\nFirst, we elected the guy. That's bad enough. Say what you want about Russians meddling in our elections, millions of Americans voted for this man to take office, despite what he's said, done, and who he is. IMO, that's the real issue here, not Trump's criminal dealings. If he's impeached, what happens? Trump supporters just get more angry and double down in their opposition. They see the \"Washington insiders\" like Mueller as having conspired to get Trump out of office (or stop the #TrumpTrain!!) and will just vote for the next person who mirrors his message.\n\nThen we'd have a more polarized America that looks like it can't control it's political situation. Do you really think Putin cares who is in office as long as we are in political turmoil? He would LOVE for us to impeach Trump. It would make it SO much easier to prey on the uneducated Trump supporter and push them farther right. Additionally, this would do nothing to stop the actually successful things this administration is trying to accomplish as Pence would likely push the same agenda.\n\nGreat. Robert Mueller \"is winning.\" How happy we should all be.\n\nIMO, the absolute best outcome is that Dems shellack the GOP this fall. I hope Mueller takes his time with the investigation. I would rather have the evidence he produces influence the American voter in 2020 than have Trump enter a long, drawn out legal process in which he will just declare the judicial system \"corrupt\" and his supporters will believe him. I would rather have him lose and show the world that no, the majority of Americans do NOT support this man, and here is the absolutely lopsided electoral college vote to prove it.\n\nTL;DR: Does Mueller \"winning\" even matter\/if he wins, don't we all lose?\n\n\n\n","created_utc":1537130828,"score":33,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

But they failed to take into account that there was a large spike his first year due to Bush-era spending, and that was followed by massive bailouts ([which have resulted in a net positive profit for the government](https:\/\/projects.propublica.org\/bailout\/)) and potentially saved millions of people's jobs.\n\nThen the economy tanked further, which meant that federal income was way down.

Depending on how you account for it ([this article walks through three methods](https:\/\/www.thebalance.com\/national-debt-under-obama-3306293)), Obama's eight years in office through a tumultuous period of time resulted in less of a debt increase than Trump's administration is pushing us to after 1.5 years.\n\nTrump believes in leverage and borrowing money and not paying for things.

THIS is their favorite quality about him.  \n\nThey need that type of leader to force the implementation of ultimately what Evangelicals want...Christian theocratic rule.

In fact, I\u2019d go as far as to say that\u2019s why they surround the Republican Party...it\u2019s the party of \u201cGod\u201d. \n\nThe Supreme Court picks are more important than Trump.

Once they have theological justices appointed they can overrule congress and even the states and claim things like abortions and gay marriage as unconstitutional.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s just the start...\n\nThey will implement public prayer in courts, in schools and houses of governance, they will expand laws, loosen the death penalty, overrule on local cases such as sexual or racial discrimination etc. \n\nTHIS is what they mean by Make America Great AGAIN, they want to take it back...way back.

{"author":"not_that_planet","body":"As a liberal evangelical, the term evangelical voter (IMHO) has nothing to do Christian evangelism.  It is more like a label that is caused by coincidence.  \n\nI think the \"evangelical\" voter block is really the same group of people \/ families that voted democrat (the so-called southern democrats) when the democratic party was the party of racism and Jim Crow.  It just so happens that church is a central part of southern life and a lot of anti-civil rights activism took place through the white Baptist churches.  Because the group of people that attended (and still attend) those churches are also the same people who wanted to keep racism as an institution in America, I think the term evangelical just kind of stuck.\n\nIn any case, just remember that if this story about our beloved smoky-eyed queen of the forked tongue is true, she is doing it because she and her family quite likely have a long history with racism, and racism isn't God.","created_utc":1537220600,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"ProgressiveLogic","body":"I kind of get what you are getting at. Black rap depicts bad attitudes towards whites. Stories get passed around of whites being afraid around blacks because they are white. \n\nYea, I suppose there is black racism. But lets not forget that whites have the overwhelming power to act out their racism with little to no repercussions for their actions. So I see the intensity level of white racism far exceeding that of black racism. \n\nAnd there is the point to be made that if White racism was eliminated, there would be no Black racism since Black racism is a response to overt White racism\/suppression. I know. I was there in the 60s. \n\nMy neighbor in the college dorm one year was a black student who loudly played Malcolm X tapes. I kept hearing the phrase, 'The White Devil this...' 'The White Devil that...\". I understood. He played his militant part in helping bring about the Civil Rights Act by being a member of the Black Student Union. He never acknowledged me in the hallway, never said a word, ignored me like the White Devil I was. Even when black friends visited me in my room, my neighbor remained prejudiced against me for the whole year.\n\nDuring the more violent 1960s, Blacks were responding to White racism. Blacks were much more militant then. They were in a real fight with the Whites in those days. \n\nI would say that some Blacks were certainly more racist in those days, obviously really. But I recognized that it was justified Black racism because they could not tell which White man was for them or against them. We all look alike to them.","created_utc":1537293032,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"WhippersnapperUT99","body":"The Republicans should simply dismiss Ford's allegations as salacious, unsubstantiated garbage fabricated for political purposes and move on.\n\nHow is she credible? Does she have DNA evidence taken from under her fingernails or a video? Why didn't she go to the police 35 years ago when a proper investigation could be conducted along with a legal process to adjudicate the facts of the matter and not 36 years later when people's memories have faded and evidence has soured? So she claims she mentioned his name to her husband in 2012 at a time when he had already been an Appellate Court judge (a relatively high profile position) and thus potential Republican nominee for several years; maybe she just had a personal axe to grind against him unrelated to her allegation. How do we know that she actually mentioned his name other than her say so?\n\nDoesn't it seem at all funny and suspicious that this allegation suddenly shows up now when it could have easily been fabricated for political purposes? If the Judge were a private person and not (as he currently is) a public figure and someone were mailing allegations to his employers to get him fired, he could file a defamation lawsuit for millions of dollars and would probably win.\n\nI'm so sorry Mrs. Ford, but if you want to make a devastating, life-impacting accusation against someone, the time to do it would have been 35 years ago. Now your accusation is essentially salacious garbage. It's a filthy, underhanded trick to evade proper and timely adjudication and then make an unsubstantiated allegation 36 years later. As far I'm concerned, unless she has some solid evidence to present, whatever she has to say is disqualified.\n\nI am not saying that her story is or is not true, just that we cannot really know if it is true or fabricated, or partially true but also partially inaccurate and blown out of proportion and that people need to contemplate the possibility that the story was fabricated for political purposes.\n\nImagine if someone accused you of stealing a $2000 ring 35 years ago when you were babysitting but waited 35 years to come forward with the accusation at a time when your employer were publicly considering promoting you, or accused you punching a child, etc. Wouldn't you want the burden of proof to be on the person making the accusation? Would you consider filing a defamation lawsuit? It's kind of like that.\n","created_utc":1537295175,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"WhippersnapperUT99","body":"I'm questioning whether her claim that she mentioned her name to her therapist or anyone has veracity.  Also that her recollection of events is accurate and that she is identifying the right person.  Memories can fade and become mistaken and inaccurate over decades.  Maybe her psyche just attached his name to the incident because they got into an argument at some point in a classroom, at a party, or at the Mall, or perhaps she just has some sort of an axe to grind against him.  Maybe a \"therapist\" will attest to her story, but how do we know the therapist isn't conspiring to fabricate a smear campaign against Kavanaugh?  It's also possible that she's a support of the Democrats and finds his candidacy repugnant and is sacrificing herself to try to stop it and delay the nomination process until after the Midterms.\n\nDon't you think it's a filthy, underhanded dirty trick to bring something like this up 36 years later when it could have been properly investigated and adjudicated 35 years ago?  How is someone supposed to defend themselves against an allegation about an event that occurred 36 years ago when there is no solid evidence to back up or refute the claim?  For that reason, her accusation should simply be disqualified.\n\nI'm not a Republican or conservative, BTW and could properly be characterized as being somewhere on the moderate Left.  I don't want Kavanaugh on the bench anymore than you do.  However, I'm also an opponent of false accusations and malicious prosecution as tens of thousands of people have been wrongfully convicted.\n\nHowever, if the Democrats really do succeed in derailing his nomination and\/or dragging out the process past the Midterms while taking the Senate, allowing them to delay any Supreme Court nomination until after the 2020 Presidential election, I won't know whether to laugh my ass off or feel that an injustice was done to Kavanaugh.  I'd probably laugh my ass off, I guess, since I felt that how the Republicans treated the Merrick Garland nomination was a travesty.","created_utc":1537297413,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"derangeddollop","body":"&gt; There are three basic insights that flow from this data: 1) poverty overwhelmingly afflicts nonworkers, 2) half of the population does not work, and 3) nearly everyone who is not currently working in our society cannot or should not work. Once you accept all of these insights, the solution to poverty becomes very clear: a welfare state that provides income to nonworking people.\n&gt; \n&gt; The US already has a modest welfare state that does this to some degree. Old-age benefits primarily from Social Security and SSI cut the elderly poverty rate from 49.4 percent to 14.1 percent. Transfer incomes paid to the disabled cut their poverty from 50.1 percent to 26.6 percent. If we want to get down to super-low poverty rates, we need to build on this success by, for instance, increasing minimum benefits for old-age and disability benefits, providing paid leave, free child care, and a child allowance to families with children, providing caregiver allowances to carers, increasing the generosity and duration of unemployment benefits, and increasing student benefits such as through a living stipend.\n&gt; \n&gt; People who do not generally study poverty often erroneously believe that the answer to poverty is more jobs and higher wages. This is not surprising because this is the major poverty narrative of our society. But this strategy runs into a wall very quickly. The clear solution for ending poverty is welfare not jobs.\n&gt; \n&gt; ","created_utc":1537299762,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"ProgressiveLogic","body":"Typical Republican QuackHead statement. Thinks the rich deserve all the money and he, himself, should only get the crumbs. SAD!!!!\n\nThe bilionaires did NOT create a billion dollars in wealth all by themselves. It was their employees who actually created most the wealth. \n\nThese employees were the innovators, the organizers, the visionaries and they were the hard workers putting in almost all the effort in creating a billion dollars in wealth.\n\nThe rich just take all the credit and most the money. But the rich have only one talent, management, and there is nothing remarkable about it. A hundred thousand people could replace these rich people and be just as good at it. In fact, most wealthy people employ people smarter than themselves. Most rich people were just lucky to be in the right place at the right time. \n\nBill Gates was just plain lucky to be born into a well off family in the USA. Bill's mother sat on a corporate board with the CEO of IBM. Bill's mother got him the meeting where he was able to sell IBM his software for every computer IBM made. JEEZ, I wish I had connections like that. And may I remind you, there was only one IBM and one opportunity for one person. There were plenty of more talented people than Bill Gates.  Bill Gates did not even create his own software. It was someone else that no one remembers who. But Bill Gates takes all the credit.\n\nThe wealthy do not deserve their extreme wealth. They can easily be replaced with an equally competent person. \n\nIt is the vast majority of employees who deserve a larger piece of pie. It is their efforts, their hard work, their inventions, their intelligence that creates the wealth in this Great Country of ours.\n\nThe most you can say about the wealthy is that they have good management skills and maybe hired a few vice-presidents. Human resources employees probably hired almost all the star employees and they suffer the same problem we all do. Employees do not get paid enough for all the wealth they create.\n\nCapitalism is supposed to reward people for their efforts. But in the modern corporate world, that does not happen. Corporations are like communist communes. Everyone must work for the greater good of the company and in return they get a limited pay scale between 20,000 to $70,000 a year for most people. \n\nOh, and before you say everyone can open his own business let me tell you they cannot. There is a reason almost everyone works for a corporation. Corporations put all the mom and pop businesses out of business. Corporations are more efficient because of their size. This is not the world of 1776 when almost everybody worked for themselves. \n\nIn today's world we need corporations because mom and pop cannot do what corporations do. Walmart needs employees so we can shop there for cheap China goods bought by the ship full. But as an employee, you get very little reward for your efforts.\n\nIt was a group of Walmart purchasing agents who thought of and actually created the huge China import division at Walmart. The CEO Sam Walton did NOT do this all by his lonesome. Sam Walton was just another person with management skills who did NOT think up all the innovative ideas of how to grow into an international corporation importing from China. The Vice-Presidents, the managers, the purchasing department employees did that. \n\nSam Walton even said once that he could never start a department store from scratch in today's world. Walmart would put him out of business. There you have it. A world where almost everyone has to work for a corporation. ","created_utc":1537361060,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

You are quoting people from a primitive age that never saw the remarkable growth of America and how our government guided it into the future.\n\nEverything takes planning. Corporations, individual businesses, Federal, state and local governments all need to plan and act intelligently. People have to work together to get things done and sometimes the government is the best way to get things done. Most the time, large nation changing advancements will never get done if the government does not do it.\n\nRead about the history of America. Socialism has always played the deciding part in the nation's development from a back water colony to the country that leads the world in everything technical except high speed rail.\n\nThe originals railroads were given federal domain over the land routes with Federal dollars subsidizing every mile of track laid during the period when the government wanted the nation connected. During the same period, mail delivery to every address in the nation was guaranteed, even to rural America which costs a hell of a lot more than in the city.\n\nEvery child was guaranteed a high school education, paid for by the government. Every hamlet was connected by a road, electricity and phone service by the government some of it State funded. Every State created colleges and Community Colleges subsidized by the State Government.\n\nThe Interstate system was Federally funded. Government fully paid for the beginnings of space exploration and usage. All our phones and TV stations are transmitted via satellite around the world due to the government socialism that put into orbit the first communications satellite. Government put in the lock and dam systems for the major rivers. Government negotiated huge trade deals for farmers and other exporters. Government cleaned up the air and water which was really bad in the 1960s. Maybe you were too young to see or read about the rivers on fire and smog so thick in some cities that you had to have your car lights on.\n\nComputers were created by the government and the Internet was created by the government. Practically ever major technological advancement that America is known for was developed by or subsidized by the government in its early phases.  You could make the argument that cars would not have thrived without the government building roads out of mud and dirt trails.\n\nJust think about the things I mentioned above.

Detroit manufacturers closed down or moved overseas with new better plants and cheaper labor. Republicans ruined the Detroit economy with job loses due to the free market and free trade policies they have pushed since 1974.\n\nAmerican car companies were at fault too. Management decisions created low quality parts. Lack of investment to upgrade and improve assembly line quality created crappy cars.\n\nFree trade meant competition from superior Japanese cars. The inferior American car companies had to lay off people and close factories. Detroit was starting to become a ghost town.\n\nAmerican car companies eventually made the corporate decision to invest and improve the quality of the parts and assembly lines. But it was too late.\n\nThe Free Trade policies meant that car companies could move overseas with new improved facilities and use cheaper labor. New American cars were shipped to the U.S.  Mexico benefited the most with new factories springing up that supported the making of cars, along with a host of other manufacturers for things like refrigerator and washing machines.\n\nCar manufacturers leaving the country, this was the final nail in the coffin for Detroit. The economy collapsed never to recover. Detroit as a city government and the State of Michigan were helpless in the fight to save jobs. The Republicans made sure of that  with their constant promise that Free Trade was good for America.\n\nYou know so little about the real world.

The Republican's love affair with free trade was at its peak. The public was convinced that Republican free trade policies was the way to go.\n\nAll this came crashing down in the 2000's when unregulated speculation destroyed the U.S. economy twice in 8 years. \n\nCapitalism 'run wild' is a sure fire way to collapse an economy.

{"author":"ProgressiveLogic","body":"You cannot really find a definition for Liberal or Progressive that people can agree on. They are interchangeable names for most people who do not care about definitions. Liberals have always supported social programs to support the poor and Liberals have always been for regulations that protect the people. Me too. I am all for programs that help those in need.\n\nI am in the camp that says there is no real difference between the two, except one. Progressives, in general, want to take a more aggressive approach towards economics. Progressives want to exert government leverage to expand economic intervention in the direction of progress. \n\nPrivate Enterprise can be insufficient or at odds with the interest of most Americans. There is no rule that says Capitalism has to do what is in the interest of the nation. Progressives should step in, commit to &amp; work towards the national interests of people at a national scale.\n\nProgressives would push to mandate 100% renewable energy for the future. Progressives would mandate electric plugins at every Gas station and rental apartment, so Americans can convert to electric cars. Progressives would build a high-speed rail system throughout the Nation, or maybe a futuristic Hyperloop transport system would be better for our future. That is my vision of a Progressive platform at the Democratic Convention.\n\nI want Progress which is why I have labeled myself a progressive. It is a 'can do' attitude that America can do great things. We are missing the governmental greatness that landed a man on the moon, which in turn gave us satellite communications capabilities and cell phones that could call anywhere in the world.\n\nWe had other huge national ambitions during periods of our history. First we connected the whole of America with railroads. Later we built the Interstate system and connected the whole of America again for cars and trucks.\n\nGovernment efforts finished the electrification of the whole nation so nobody was left without access to electricity. We gave every child a free high school education. We delivered mail to every home address in the nation, no matter how remote. \n\nThese were instances I call Progressive in thought and action. We did things, great things, on a huge scale and they benefited all Americans.\n\nOK, so that is what I think of the Progressive label. But I basically agree with everything Liberal too. So really, we are on the same side of the issues, almost all the time, as far as I can tell.\n\nI just might push harder and go for the jugular when fighting Republicans.","created_utc":1537413602,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Secondly that would make sense to wonder why Obama did nothing about Ukraine. \n\nSo from this I get the vibe that Russia has had influence in our government during the Obama administration as well. It's an obvious problem that we need to fix and it isn't going to be fixed by both sides arguing that both opposing leaders were compromised. \n\nThe way to fix it is work on election security, find ways to block Russian money from pouring into our campaigns, and find ways to try and block Russian propaganda. \n\nMy belief is the Trump administration has no interest in stopping this because they have everything to gain from Russia's help. So we need to vote him out and put somebody in who will save our Democracy (voting being the cornerstone of democracy). \n\nIt also concerns me that the DNC emails were leaked but the RNC (who were also hacked) did not get their info leaked. Why is that? What do the hackers have to gain from holding on to their emails? Leverage is my best guess. Leverage on the political party that controls most of government that is a scary thought and partly why I will be voting D in the midterms. ","created_utc":1537465987,"score":3,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

AR-15s are used in more crimes than legal machine guns because they are barely regulated.\n5. More heavy regulation of AR-15s would see them used in less crimes.\n\nWhether or not guns are used in \"many\" crimes (a relative term) has no baring on whether or not they should be regulated. Nuclear weapons are used in few (zero) crimes, but you can bet your ass that the FBI is going to kick your door down if you try to \"exercise your rights\" in your garage.\n\nThe fact is that a weapon's deadliness determines whether it should be regulated, not whether it is used in a lot of crimes.\n\nAlso, the comparison of the damage a light machine gun could do versus some kid's plinkgun gun is laughable.

He also lived in a state where it would be legal for him to do so.  This is the first I've heard he had attempted to purchase machine guns and was prevented.  \n\nAlso, you have now argued that AR15 are both a kid's plinking gun, and at the same time very dangerous and need more regulation.  This seems pretty inconsistent.  ","created_utc":1537627831,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Is every single Trump supporter the exact same way? Probably not. But there are certain ideas and ways of life that are prevalent within their communities (whether in real life or on social media.) Pretending that \"not ALL Trump supporters are like that\" is ridiculous. No, they're not all like that, but enough of them are that those ideas have taken control of their party \/ platforms. The problem then becomes, why aren't those that are NOT like that that are within camp Trump trying to stop those ideas from becoming a problem? The answer is that they don't give a shit. They're fine with the racism, the homophobia, the sexism, and the whacked out ideas about science and religion as long as someone that labels themselves \"Republican\" stands in a position of power. If they weren't fine with it, there would be more of a divide within the Trump supporting community, within the Republican party itself, and there isn't. That's how and why we got Trump in the first place. Open your eyes.\" \n\nI'll also add, that being Liberal doesn't mean standing back and watching as racism, homophobia, misogyny, and the like go unchecked, because \"freedom.\"  Nothing about my being liberal means that I have to stand back in silence and watch bigotry have it's way in our society.  One does not have to tolerate intolerance to be considered a tolerant person.  Also, judging a political group as a whole based on which beliefs and ideas control that party isn't \"illiberal.\"  It's using your brain.

All he wants to do is host rallies, get on TV, and get re-elected.\n\nIs he helping? No. He\u2019s opening up a political narrative where facts don\u2019t matter and the truth is something to be debated and politicized. That being said, his rhetoric would have been far-left extremism if he thought that\u2019s what would get him elected. He has no solid political beliefs. He has no hard legislation he deeply believes in. He\u2019s here for the ratings.\n\nFar-Right extremism existed before Trump and will exist after he leaves. Trump did not create the systemic racism we see all over the country, the groups against gay marriage, the constitutionalists who refuse to give up their guns. What he did was give them a voice, he didn\u2019t create them.\n\nWhat he also did was provide a unique opportunity. Where those groups remained largely a silent minority, they are now prominently attending rallies and screaming \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d and burning their Nikes.

If you don't believe me post porn on Facebook and see how long your account lasts.  Just because they don't check your spelling or offer any editorial feedback on your latest rant doesn't mean they don't have control.\n\n&gt;There is a huge difference between a publisher and a platform. The users of the platform have their rights to free speech and\/or free  press, the platform doesn't since it doesn't even voice an opinion of  its own to begin with.\n\nThe terms aren't mutually exclusive, so your argument immediately falls apart. Freedom of Press protects publishers regardless of what other labels also apply to them.\n\nFurther, an argument can be made that the label of platform doesn't apply. Platform has multiple definitions, but the salient one here is \"a place or opportunity for public discussion\". Facebook isn't public - you are required to obtain a membership and keeping that membership is contingent on following the terms of service set out by the company which you agree they can change unilaterally at any time for any reason. Twitter, Reddit and most other Social media sites also require you to have an account and obey their respective TOS agreements.\n\nEven if you can refute that argument, you would have to also establish that these companies are not publishers.  They take submissions from users and place them in a publication - their website, which they control the formatting of, decide when it is shown to some degree (especially Facebook and its news feed). That the contract is open to any willing to enter into it doesn't change this reality.\n\nThey are publishers. Therefore Freedom of Press does apply to them.

You think that I see freedom of speech as a tool to demand a platform to let you speak on said platform. However, that is not what I mean with freedom of speech. In fact, I use the term exactly like OP does, which is protection from the government using its power to silence you from or force you to voice your opinion,  so I don't understand where this misconception of you comes from.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I speak on a private platform and get kicked out by its owner, that is not a free speech issue and I never claimed it was. It's like you didn't read my first comment in the context of what part I replied to at all. When I said \"There is a huge difference between a publisher and a platform. The users of the platform have their rights to free speech and\/or free press, the platform doesn't\\[\u2026\\]\", I meant that only the users would be affected **in their right to free speech** by government regulation, because I don't see the platforms themselves as acting speakers or publishers and thus not as holders of a right to free speech or press in this context.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHOWEVER, that does not mean that the platform owner is without protection, because the owner kicking me out is not doing so by invoking his free speech right, he is simply using his right of property by casting me out of said property. So in this whole scenario that you mentioned free speech is actually not involved at all, which was MY WHOLE ACTUAL POINT.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen platform owners kick someone from their platform, it's not grounded on their freedom of speech but on their property rights. So basically I totally agree with your result\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;No they don't, not on someone else's platform.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbecause I wasn't talking about  users using their freedom of speech AGAINST THE PLATFORM OWNER, but AGAINST THE STATE. You were the one making this a conflict between the freedoms of speech of user and platform owner, when it actually isn't. If there is a conflict between a platform owner and his user, the platform owner \"wins\", because his property rights make it perfectly legal for him to bar the user from his platform and it's not even an infringement of free speech, because freedom of speech isn't even involved at all if the platform owner is not the state, an associate of the state or the public.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's the difference in our views. You wanna see a conflict of freedom of speech in a scenario that I didn't even talk about (I was talking about government regulations, you about a conflict between user and platform owner) and that I don't see that conflict in. Freedom of speech is not involved in your conflict, it's a private platform owner  using his property rights to **not infringe** on someone's free speech rights, because the use of his property right is perfectly legal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was talking about whose freedom of speech\/press would be infringed on by government regulations but you suddenly shifted this conversation to a conflict between user and platform and just strawmaned some positions on me that I don't hold and didn't voice just so you could entertain that uninvited hypothetical scenario ,in which I don't even disagree with you in the result just in how to get to that result, and totally explode and trashtalk me when I tried to set your wrong impression right.

That's just not an actual conflict of freedom of speech.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;You're not editorial... they can be freeform. But... it is your property? Right?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYES!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;That's the problem here for you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWHY? I never stated anything that goes against the conclusions above. I was talking about me not viewing social media themselves as publishers, only as platforms, and thus not as holders of the right to free speech\/press when it comes to government regulations on what you can say on social media. The ones holding that right are the users, it's effectively only THEIR right to freely voice their opinions that is infringed upon by such a government interference. I was not talking about a conflict between user and platform. In such a conflict freedom of speech is completely irrelevant because the private platform's owner can do whatever he want, I never dismissed that possibility for such a scenario. I was simply not talking about that scenario that you so obsess over. When you bring up a new scenario FUCKING ASK ME ABOUT MY BELIEFS INSTEAD OF JUST UNFAVORABLY ASSUMING MY POSITIONS!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;A platform is property. Facebook is literally IP ran on literal servers that are paid for.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhy do you pretend like I didn't know that? It simply didn't matter in regards to what I was talking about, which was the question of who actually holds the right of free speech and is infringed on that if the government interferes in platforms with regulations, so I didn't mention it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;They can allow people to come in. But if you break any rule, they can kick you out. Physical or digital platform. They pay the rent, they make the rules.\n\nAgain, I agree with that. Why are you too thick headed to understand that I was talking about a different scenario in which this all doesn't matter and thus were not mentioned?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;There are no \"platform\" protections?.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot what I said. I just said the social media platforms are not holders of freedom of speech\/press. In a conflict between user and platform, the platform's owner decides, grounded on his property rights, whether the user is allowed and, if yes, what he is allowed to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSame even goes in case of government regulations. When the government regulates what is allowed on a private platform, it is NOT the freedom of speech\/press of the platform's owner that is infringed, since the platform's owner actually doesn't voice any opinion of his own that is being regulated, he only owns the platform that these opinions are being espoused on. But of course it is an infringement of his property rights when the government decides in his stead what is allowed on HIS property and what not. We are only having this argument right now because I didn't explicitly add that and because  you jumped to your own conclusions about what I believe instead of FUCKING ASKING ME and proceeded to ignore my elaborations on your scenario WHICH WERE IN AGREEMENT WITH YOU!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;You can ignore property rights if you want, but it destroys your argument.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI didn't \"ignore\" (rather just not mention) property rights because I thought THEY WERE OBVIOUS. Had you posted your first comment WITHOUT accusing me of thinking otherwise, I would have simple answered with \"Yes, agree\" and this stupid debate WOULD HAVE CONCLUDED THERE.

{"author":"Fratermalus1","body":"That's ok, I see that you want social media companies thoroughly protected from regulation. It just doesn't go well with me, because I really am having a hard time viewing those social media companies as publishers or acting speakers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe acting speakers part should be obvious. Excluding the statements the owners of those social media platforms make on their own said platforms nothing written on their social media is any opinion they wanna associate themselves with. They typically don't use their social media platforms to make use of their freedom to free speech, they wanna make money with ads that their users see, which in turn are the actual ones who are using their freedom to free speech, for THEY are the ones exchanges their ideas. But I think that one is, indeed, obvious, since you yourself only cite freedom of press for the owners of the platforms, not the freedom of speech.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, about freedom of press, by declaring the owners of social media to be publishers, it feels to me like you are thus declaring that they are associated to everything that is being written on their platforms, which I think is not the case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my (german) understanding, the freedom of press and art are extensions of freedom of speech. Free speech (actually \"freedom of information\" in Germany) lets you freely spread your opinion by matter of speech, whereas freedom of press and freedom of art let you use written, digital or other channels and forms of expression to achieve that end. They (the artist or the publisher) still require to actually WANT to spread a certain expression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, with social media that is not the case. Yes, you brought up some correct points, which are that they slightly control what is going on on their platforms with  their TOS and that they also partly decide what you see when.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut their TOS are mostly just ensuring that everything that is going on on their platform is according to law. Wanting the users of your platform to abide by the law doesn't make you a publisher.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor example, if I were to open my home for free discussions for one day, but set up a rule that said \"Whoever starts threatening others with violence in my home, gets kicked out\", would simply setting up and enforcing that rule make me the publisher of everything that is said in my home? Because I am loosely \"in control of what is being said\"? Let's even go a step further, let's say I set up a rule that says \"don't be mean\", which is not necessary by law, would that make me a publisher? I'd say no, because I still wouldn't actually decide which ideas are being spread, and I still wouldn't condone or condemn any of them by their ideological content. It's basically just setting up house rules, which is already protected by property rights, I don't need to cite my freedom of speech or press for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut what's even more important is your following claim:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;\\[They are publishers because they\\] take submissions from users and place them in a publication - their website, which they control the formatting of, decide when it is shown to some degree (especially Facebook and its news feed).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, the first part of that statement would apply even to any host of a chat-service. Of course they control the formatting of their website, there at least gotta be a standard one, otherwise it would necessitate sensible access of each and any user to the main-code, and just the lack of customization features to deviate from that standard doesn't make a website host a publisher. It just makes him a host who\u2026 doesn't give his clients a satisfying amount of customization features.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe actually interesting part is the last part of your statement, which is social media being publishers because they decide when (and honestly also which) content is shown to you. Here is what makes me absolutely sure that social media like Facebook can't be publishers. What you say sounds like social media are controlling content to put on their website, which you paraphrase as \"a publication\". But that is actually not true. There isn't any \"one publication\" at any time. It's a big mass of user accounts, which are shown different \"news feeds\" based on their and other users' preferences. The social media don't give a shit about what these preferences are, as long as they don't go against their TOS, which are mostly derived from the laws of the nations their services are being run in.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey don't care which content actually reaches you, which is something that an actual publisher would care about, which, as I stated above, would be a person or group of persons using written, digital or other channels of expression to spread a certain opinion of theirs. Facebook and all the others don't have a certain opinion that they wanna spread, they don't show you what THEY want you to see, their service is showing you whatever YOU want to see and keeping from you whatever YOU don't want to see.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom my personal point of view, someone so indifferent can't be a publisher, only a host of a platform. But yes, as you correctly stated, those are not mutually exclusive, too bad it came of like I wanted to set up a dichotomy in my first comment, a good example for something being both would be a blog or news-site website with comment function. To be called a publisher, however, there actually needs to be some form of personal agency in what said publisher spreads, content-wise. But spreading certain information or ideas out of personal conviction is not what social media companies do, their service, instead, is basically tailoring a nice, personal room for you, where you find same-minded people and see stuff that entices you to get active on their platform. And I just don't think that service alone is deserving of this inviolable protection of free press.","created_utc":1538068311,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"AkiTendo","body":"&gt;That's ok, I see that you want social media companies thoroughly protected from regulation. \n\nI never said that. Quickest way to my block list is to put words in my mouth - I don't suffer fools. I said the government can't force them to give access to their platform to an individual. Regulations on what types of data they can harvest, how they store it, how they secure it, and how they release it are an entirely different item. If Congress was looking into those issues during the hearings then good. My impression though is that they were debating who can and cannot have access, and that's a non-starter under Freedom of Press. \n\n&gt;It just doesn't go well with me, because I really am having a hard time viewing those social media companies as publishers or acting speakers.\n\nWell, flatly, you're wrong.\n\n&gt; From my (german) understanding, the freedom of press and art are  extensions of freedom of speech. Free speech (actually \"freedom of  information\" in Germany) \n\nThat explains much.  \"Freedom of Speech\" has been ruled by the SCOTUS multiple times to be a blanket protection on freedom of expression regardless of the mode it takes. Unlike Germany we don't have to enumerate each and every mode of communication extant or yet to be devised.\n\n&gt; What you say sounds like social media are controlling content to put on  their website, which you paraphrase as \"a publication\". But that is  actually not true. There isn't any \"one publication\" at any time. It's a  big mass of user accounts, which are shown different \"news feeds\" based  on their and other users' preferences. \n\nIt doesn't matter if the work is carefully crafted for mass consumption or assembled by bots for the viewing of one person, it's still a publication under the law.\n\n&gt; They don't care which content actually reaches you, which is something that an actual publisher would care about...    \n&gt;  \n&gt;From my personal point of view, someone so indifferent can't be a publisher, only a host of a platform. \n\nYou have a staggering amount of ignorance about publishers to the point where I don't think you understand what the word means.  If you go to a book publisher and pay their fee, they'll print your book. They could care less what happens after. Decades ago you had to put in an order for thousands of books before they'd take the job, but today there are publishers who print single copies on demand.\n\nI think you are conflating the business of authoring and preparing content to the physical process of presenting it, be it on page with a physical press or online using a server.  They aren't the same. It is the presentation of content that is protected by the US Bill of Rights, whether it's a presentation of new ideas or those centuries old.\n\nThere is **one exception only** to Freedom of the Press, and it's existence and nature blows your argument that preparing ideas and presenting them are the same out of the water - copyright. Congress is empowered by the Constitution to grant copyrights to works to their authors. Other publishers which violate those rights are liable to the fines and penalties outlined in the law.\n\nI've been in the web publishing business almost since it's beginning, and worked for firms which publish across multiple medias most of my career. I'm well aware of the nuance of what qualifies as a publication. You'd be surprised that it's a very, very low bar to clear in the US.\n\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;","created_utc":1538070545,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

But, it sure does sound prophetic about the presidency of W.\n\nIf the satire writers of The Onion were able to make such predictions based purely on a Republican taking office, it means that this is pretty obviously the result of Republican administrations.\n\nSatire, prophetic, but satire: [Bush: 'Our Long National Nightmare Of Peace And Prosperity Is Finally Over'](https:\/\/politics.theonion.com\/bush-our-long-national-nightmare-of-peace-and-prosperi-1819565882)\n\nNow take a look at the national debt under Republican administrations versus under Democratic administrations. Neither party is fiscally conservative. But, one party is much more conservative for, at the very least, realizing that bills must be paid.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.vox.com\/polyarchy\/2018\/4\/20\/17262944\/democrats-fiscal-responsibility-budget-deficits\n\nhttps:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/politics\/archive\/2012\/10\/gop-presidents-have-been-the-worst-contributors-to-the-federal-debt\/264193\/\n\nhttps:\/\/www.snopes.com\/fact-check\/who-increased-the-debt\/","created_utc":1538288822,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}
