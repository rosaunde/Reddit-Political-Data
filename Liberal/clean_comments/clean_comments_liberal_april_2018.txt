Whereas unions tend to push up wages at the bottom and restrain them at the top, compressing the wage distribution, there's no such effect for occupational licensing. Wage dispersion within a given trade is not effected by licensing.\n\n&gt;In other words, the most successful workers will find that occupational licensing recreates the wage gains that unions once provided.

The closest ones were taken in 1960 and 1970.\n\n&gt;Second, the census itself has not asked a citizenship question since 1950. Third, the American Community Survey included a citizenship question in 2010, although it was not in the census itself.\n\n&gt;Let\u2019s take a quick stroll through the history. In 1950, the decennial census form asked respondents to enter their birthplace and whether they were naturalized.\n\n&gt;In 1960, the birthplace question appeared again \u2014 but not the naturalization question.\n\n&gt;In 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000, the census sent households a separate, long-form survey that included a citizenship question. This was in addition to the standard questionnaire, but only a fraction of U.S. households would receive it, about one out of every six.\n\n&gt;In 1996, the census began to send out the ACS, which it continues to use today. This in-depth annual survey of 3.5 million households has contained a citizenship question since 2005. Contrary to what Sanders indicated, the citizenship question appeared in 2010.\n\n&gt;It may not have been in the census itself, or in the long-form survey (which was sent out in 2000 but discontinued by 2010), but the citizenship question did appear in the ACS.\n\nSo, the question itself of citizenship isn\u2019t surprising, historically. \n\nSpecifically the citizenship question was asked in the ACS which is an addendum survey of the census in 2010 as well.

{"author":"The_Poop","body":"I didn't make the claim, I said it is on par with the claim you have made, and so if I wanted to resort to poorly constructed claims based on meager evidence for the sake of challenging yours, I would use that argument.\n\nYou're right, I do not have evidence to support a claim that democrats are getting votes via dead people and illegal immigrants, mostly because I have had no real interest in convincing people that is the case.\nBut I can *get* that evidence, legitimate or otherwise, particularly for the latter claim.\n\nThat's the point. It's a bogus argument either way because the reality is that whether the republicans or the democrats have used illegitimate means to procure votes, the effect would be negligible due to the conspicuous nature of such activities. If, say, democrats were using illegal immigration to boost votes enough to make a substantial difference, they wouldn't be able to get away with it, practically speaking. It would have to be small enough to go largely unnoticed or poorly contested.\n\nHere is what I am perceiving as your problem: you are a democrat. You are ideologically chained to the left, and you are tribally opposed to the right on the basis of what the left has told you rather than what you have observed for yourself via humoring your opposition with the least bias possible.\nYou haven't proven republicans *wrong* , you've just communicated that you don't *like* them.\nThat's fine, you don't have to. I used to hate them too, because I used to be everything I just described.\n\nBut you can't really *learn* anything by picking sides and allowing yourself to be manipulated by 'your team' , it just *feels* good.\n\nIn order to perceive reality from the most objective and factual possible perspective, one has to assume that both sides are wholly invested in lying to their constituencies.\nSo we can either assume that *both* republicans and democrats use illegitimate means to get their votes, or we can assume *neither* do. \nIn doing so you can attempt to smother confirmation bias and find real answers rather than the 'democrat claim' or the 'republican claim' .\nAt which point, you can reliably pick sides on an issue by issue basis. \n\nIt's also useful to assume that neither side actually *cares* about the issues their potential voters care about. What they are concerned with is manipulating and motivating those voters to go out and reelect them. They want power, not solutions.\nI think most people understand this. Which is likely what made both Trump and Bernie so popular-- they seemed like they weren't more of the same, like they actually cared about something, cared about the people. \nMaybe they were\/are, maybe not.\n\nThis is why the democrats didn't get DACA when it was sitting right in front of them, ripe for the taking.\nIt is more useful to them to use illegal immigration to stir up their base come the next election(s) than to actually accomplish what their base wants.\nEspecially if it helps their opponents in any way, such as with DACA and Trump. It would have made him look good to both make a deal regarding DACA and to get funding for the wall. They didn't want that, they wanted DACA hanging in their air for them to run on.\nNow, this could all be inaccurate because it's mostly conjecture and reasoning.\nBut those things infinitely more valuable to the discerning citizen than emotion and partisanship.","created_utc":1522881945,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

You kept after me for numbers, and as soon as I pulled some out of my ass _at **your** behest_ you go, \"your goal is reduction in guns\". That's not my goal! It was a suggested means to a goal that **you** requested \"I don't see hard numbers\". I stated repeatedly what my goal is:\n\n* My goal is to not have a school shooting every week.\n\n* My goal is to have firearm violence rates on par with other developed nations.\n\nFurthermore, I said a decrease in firearms per capita, not \"taking guns away\". Those things are not the same. Stop trying to repurpose my argument into a straw man.\n\nAlso, you're repurposing the NRA's talking points into \"a reduction in the number of guns and\/or a ban on assault-style weapons\". Most gun owners don't own military style assault weapons and even then a ban on them doesn't mean that they will be confiscated. There has been ZERO legislation proposed that takes guns from law-abiding gun owners. The NRA photoshopped an image of Emma Gonzalez ripping up a shooting target and replaced the target with a poorly rendered image of the U.S. Constitution. You yourself claimed that the left is \"secretly\" trying to undo the 2nd amendment. My point to you is that this claim is baseless, which it is. Universal background checks don't infringe on your 2nd Amendment, it's not tantamount to ripping up the constitution, and it isn't the left trying to take guns away from people. It would, however, have a negative effect on gun sales... which is why the NRA is opposed to it. The NRA's goal is to increase sales of firearms by stoking fears, and they're doing a fantastic job. \n\nI'll tell you this much, if gun lovers, and the gun lobby **don't** want the 2nd amendment overturned or their guns taken, they had better start approaching the issue with a little more candor and pragmatism because this refusal to confront the very real problem of gun violence in this country and\/or agree to moderate compromising solutions isn't going to make the issue go away, it's only going to make the left move in a more extreme direction, e.x. Australia 1996.\n\nIf the gun lobby doesn't want their guns taken away, agree to universal background checks... Universal background checks don't take your guns away.\n\nIf the gun lobby doesn't want their guns taken away, agree to mandatory minimum waiting periods.... Mandatory minimum waiting periods don't take your guns away.\n\nIf the gun lobby doesn't want their guns taken away, agree to a ban on certain militaristic accessories... A ban on military-style accessories like extended magazines and \"bump stocks\" don't take your guns away.\n\nAnd **even** when the solution could potentially \"take your gun away\" (if your gun is a high powered military style rifle) it doesn't infringe on the 2nd amendment. My point stands.... the claim that gun control is tantamount to overturning the 2nd amendment is baseless.\n\nRegarding your attempt to point to a decrease in homicides (along with crime in general) as justification that we don't need gun control, that's a weak argument. The issue of crime and violence is a **much** larger issue than gun control and\/or school\/mass shootings. Furthermore, you can't prove any causal factors, and the reason you can't goes right back to the NRA. They lobbied (successfully) to prevent the CDC from conducting research in to gun violence.

In any case, I said a good goal would be less guns per 100 citizens. That\u2019s not proposed legislation and that\u2019s not quotas. You then asked how that was different from taking guns away and how you could decrease the numbers without taking guns from people. I explained that the effect of good gun control would be a decrease in guns per capita, through licensing background checks etc. the number would decrease on its own. Now all the sudden you\u2019re talking about quotas and taking guns from people again. You are arguing a losing point, and you\u2019re losing the debate so you keep shifting the premise to avoid reflecting on your own preconceived notion of what \u201cgun control\u201d means. You\u2019re the biased one here, not me. ","created_utc":1523021192,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"nationalistsareRINOs","body":"For me personally, when I think of classical liberalism I think of people like Adam Smith, Denis Diderot, JS Mill, John Locke, Jeremy Bentham, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Condorcet, and so on. Although they are philosophically diverse, you can easily trace the main ideas forward in time to modern liberals - 1) belief in progress and promoting of science, 2) egalitarianism, and 3) belief that the government should be meritocratic, democratic, and look after the common welfare (rather than some idea of \"the social order\").\n\nEnlightenment-era philosophers were extremely ideologically diverse. Some were extremely leftwing and basically planted the ideological foundations for modern socialism, like Godwin, and some were basically conservative liberals, like Burke.\n\nIn that sense you might characterize Jordan Peterson as a classical liberal in the sense of being like Burke, although I don't really know much about him so I don't know if that would even be correct. The only thing I really know about Peterson's ideology is that he is very \"anti-SJWs\" and just on the face of it that makes him appear illiberal to me. I have no idea what his general political positions or political philosophy would be.\n\nOther people ITT are correct that conservatives are usually the ones who use the term these days, it has kind of been taken over by them (same as with \"libertarian\"). So if Jordan Peterson says he is a classical liberal, and you agree with his philosophy, then I would say you are probably both conservatives and not liberals. Ultimately, the only way to really find out would be to spend more time talking about politics with liberals, and\/or reading about the philosophers I listed above.","created_utc":1523027574,"score":5,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

I fully understand your desire to hold us all to a higher level of decency, and your notion that we are all on the same side here, shows that you are a person of integrity...\n\nBut, it is NOT going to work.  All Americans are NOT on the same side.  Not anymore.  That value is gone like last weekend's Taco Bell burrito.  A very large number of trump voters really are out to get us.  The gop politicians have worked hard and steadily for years now to keep liberals from voting.  Especially people of color.  Trump during the campaign exhorted his followers to \"poll watch\" and to use  \"2nd amendment rights\" as enforcement if necessary in areas where people of color lived.  He encouraged people to be self-appointed \"Trump election observers\" Pure voter intimidation, this.  \n\nThen there is the work they have done to decrease the number of polling places, making it harder for people to vote.  Almost 900 polling places were closed.  Add to this voter ID laws and gerrymandering, on top of Russian interference, and you have a skewed election.  Please understand:  The GOP is NOT on our side, they DON\"T want us to be all Kumbayah with them, they want us beneath them, disenfranchised.  \n\nYes, trump voters are just as much constituents in the USA as we liberals are.  But I cannot and will not respect them. Not their politicians and not their average citizens.  Remember President Obama \"reaching across the aisle\" endlessly?  He was rebuffed every. single. time.  Not *once* did the GOP reach back to him in good faith. And the average trump-voter is likewise not going to reach out to us, or consider us as fellow constituents, equally deserving of respect.  Take some time today and listen to some right-wing talk radio.  Listen to the callers and really hear what they are saying.  Look again at the pictures of the Charlottesville rally.  Watch again the video where Ted Nugent shakes his rifle and yells to his cheering crowd that HRC can ride his gun.  \n\nI agree with you that there is russian involvement but they could have not gained traction with GOP voters if there was not fertile ground in which to work.  \n\nAnd lastly, Education?  These folks don't want us liberals to educate them.  Many of these folks think the world is less than 10K years old and that we are living in End Times.  They resent like hell the idea that we are smarter than they, and they openly sneer at intellectuals.  And again, the GOP has been working for years to disrupt and destroy our public school system, damning it with faint support and outright hostility.  Betsy de Vos' appointement as Ed Secretary was no mistake.  I urge you to try to educate a few 2016 trump voters and just see how far you get.  \n\nIf liberals continue to turn the other cheek, it is going to get slugged, too.

{"author":"lordperiwinkle","body":"Okay, here is my answer:  There are some trump supporters who can be talked to, reasoned with. But not many.  I have tried discussing Trump's failings with neighbors, acquaintances, and a few cousins.  All of them rebuffed me, all of them said that anyone who thinks trump may have colluded with russia are crazy, or that they were glad the russians helped prevent a HRC presidency. None of them were too fussed about trump's sexual peccadilloes, (one 50ish woman laughed and said she wishes trump would grab *her* by the pussy).  I brought up trump \"university\"  Not a single one of them gave a damn.  Nor about his lawsuits, or about the time the trumps were fined for not renting to people of color.  Most of them sympathized with him.  Standards, you know. So, to answer your question, no, I don't think most of them can be reasoned with.  Talk is not going to do it.  Maybe a few folks will see the error when their own livelihood is at stake, like the soybean farmers.  maybe. Too many Americans have spent the past 20 or so years gorging on fast food, and entertaining themselves by watching vapid crap, like reality tv, and nascar, and listening to rush limbaugh   and fox news.  And then there is evangelical christianity, which just adds to the stupid, squares it, cubes it, and gives it a special club for them to all attend. And us liberals have become weak.  We should have been in the streets over their denying President Obama a SCOTUS appointment.  But we weren't. Too late now.\n\nI want you to notice the amount of trump supporters on reddit who try to engage us liberals in open, honest dialogue.  Almost zero. They are not reaching out in good faith, they are doubling down.  I see this on other social media, I see it in rl. And they are the ones with more guns, and less compunctions.  I had a convo last year with this guy who assumed I was a conservative.  He was with his kids, the oldest was about 15 I'd guess.  He steered the talk to politics. He came out with this:  that if he could, he would gather up all the effing liberals and line them and their children up against a wall and shoot them down.  What about babies, I asked.  Those too, he said, get all of them.  This man is not the only person I have heard advocate murdering liberals.  Check out what ted nugent said yesterday.  \n\n\nThis is what we are up against. I believe we are now beyond mere political disagreement.  The gop has colluded with russian operatives to win the election, and not a single person that I know who voted for trump has told me that they made a mistake.  If anything their rhetoric is more strident, more prejudicial.  \n\npart of me is glad that there are still people like you, who have this Kumbayah philosophy, believing that persuasive talk is the panacea for all our societal ills.  But...You are also part of the problem.  \n\nI have got work to do, so I can't continue this tonight.  Why don't you get back to me in a few months and update me on your conciliatory efforts.  Let us know just how many folks you have brought around.  Your ideals of brotherhood are very, very noble.  But that nobility is wrapped in a smug, superior attitude, with a large dollop of ignorance on top.  You think you are better than folks like me, folks who are scared and angry and rightfully so.  Better because you want to reach out, to converse, to engage, to not label.

Nearly half the American public (48%) trusts CNN more than Trump, compared with one-third (35%) who trust Trump more than CNN and another 13% who trust both equally as a source of information. The results are similar when Trump is pitted against the left-leaning MSNBC \u2013 45% trust MSNBC more, 32% trust Trump more, and 16% trust both equally. The right-leaning Fox News also bests the president as a trusted information source \u2013 30% trust Fox more and 20% trust Trump more, although a plurality of 37% trust both equally.\n\n&gt;The results for the president versus MSNBC have not changed much in the past year (47% trusted MSNBC more, 33% trusted Trump more, 15% trusted both equally in March 2017). The pendulum has swung slightly but not substantially away from Fox News and toward Trump in that matchup (37% trusted Fox News more, 17% trusted Trump more, 36% trusted both equally in March 2017). CNN was not included in the 2017 poll.\n\n&gt;It should come as no surprise that many more Republicans trust the president as an information source than either CNN (12% versus 75% for Trump) or MSNBC (11% versus 72% for Trump).

In 2017, 29% of Republicans trusted Trump more, 26% trusted Fox more, and 44% trusted both equally, marking a slight gain for the president in the current poll.\n\n\nThere, now there should be no confusion as to what the graphic shows.","created_utc":1523305002,"score":3,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

This is precisely the time for Democrats to swing left. And I mean *hard* to the left.\n\nMedicare for All is popular. Electoral reform is popular. Gun reform is popular. Stronger progressive taxation is popular. Climate change action is popular. \n\nHistoric levels of dissatisfaction with the GOP and Trump mean that this is the perfect time to strike out left and show the country that there *is* a real difference between the Trump cult of personality and the reactionary knee-jerking of the rest of the Republicans. A strong, liberal congress and administration could make some real progress on addressing the systemic flaws in our economic and political structures. A centrist Democratic Party would only generate political impotence. Combining conservative ideas with liberal reform generates nothing but problems, and gives conservatives ammo to claim that non-conservatives can't govern (see Obamacare and the subsequent 7 years of Republican attacks based on it). Conservatives would hate centrist Dems for existing, liberals would hate them for not being liberal enough, and moderate Democrats would be exhausted from defending all their decisions from both sides.\n\n&gt; The Republican Party today is the Democrat Party of the 90\u2019s.\n\nFun fact: that's what conservatism does. When change happens, it resists progress. When change becomes entrenched, conservatives forget that they were the ones screaming bloody murder over that change, and proceed to proclaim themselves the guardians of this new norm while accusing those seeking further reform of undermining the present system.\n\nSo of course the Republican Party of today is the Democratic Party of the 1990's. You just watch, in one generation conservatives will claim they never opposed gay marriage or LGBTQ rights or make up excuses about how \"it was a different time\" or some crap like that.\n\n&gt; moderate democrats feel the bar has been moved to far left and they now are more inline with republicans\n\nLet me get this straight: you think that Democrats moved too far left and are now in-line with Republicans?? Do you actually think that Republicans are further left? You couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nIf we were in Europe, our Democratic Party would be solidly centrist and our Republican Party would be firmly on the right (and drifting further little by little). By most other democracies' standards, we hardly *have* a liberal, left-leaning party. And I think that's why so many of us are frustrated - we want a truly liberal party, but the Democrats are afraid of taking up that mantle and taking the bold steps that we so desperately wish they would.","created_utc":1523311143,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"KrookedasFuck","body":"I am personally of the opinion that \u201cplaying politics\u201d has been the single worst move of the Democratic Party of the last 25 years. They try to play the same game as the GOP but will never be as successful, because Democratic voters have ethical lines that can\u2019t be crossed, even when Dem politicians don\u2019t. Republican voters have no such qualms. They don\u2019t value honesty, consistency, or integrity in any significant way. So when the game of politics is played, the GOP will *always* win.\n\nTo me, the way the Democrats win is by standing up for what they actually believe is right, not what they think plays well to the mythical swing voter. \n\nAs that pertains to Trump, he absolutely deserves to be impeached, just from the facts we have now. The immoluments, not enacting sanctions, the constant lies and twitter rants, the endless scandals of his appointment cabinet and White House staff. He absolutely should be impeached and that\u2019s what needs to be said.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean candidates need to dwell on it. They should still be campaigning on the actual policy improvements they want to make, but they shouldn\u2019t tiptoe around Trump either. Any sane person believes he should be impeached. Refusing to say it just makes it look like you\u2019re playing politics, which *everybody* hates.","created_utc":1523318045,"score":5,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

The Occupy movement was popular and despite how ridiculous it ended up becoming, income inequality had some meat to it as a beef for middle class people.  The banks had just been bailed out, the backlash to the notion of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d was a fundamental and legitimate criticism of how we approached our countries capitalist economy.\n\nI was very critical of the US and it\u2019s past when I was an undergrad, probably because it\u2019s one of the first times you are thinking critically about your own country and it\u2019s intoxicating to realize some of what you were taught when you were young wasn\u2019t the \u201cwhole truth.\u201d\n\nAs you get older and gain some experience, I realized that western values on the whole are mostly good. We tend to criticize the US as a whole while comparing it to different aspects of a lot of other countries which isn\u2019t fair.\n\nThis idea that colleges are largely liberal echo chambers is also reinforced by professors who have never worked outside of academia and have a limited perspective on working in corporate america or owning a business of their own.  \n\nStudents are largely inexperienced and take them at their word.  This doesn\u2019t go over well on Reddit because most young people don\u2019t want to be told that they need experience for a more well informed perspective.  I\u2019ve changed incredibly from age 18 to 28- in my views, work ethic, and perspective on success and how to live life.  I\u2019m sure it will change again soon.\n\nNow I consider myself center-right, and could certainly be swayed to vote Democrat again, but there\u2019s a pervasive element in the party that is a big turn off.  They seem to have made fringe social issues a central part of their platform and that just doesn\u2019t sit well with a lot of middle class Americans.  The attitude of \u201cwe know more than you\u201d seems to be more toxic than ever and a big turn off to voters. There seems to be a feeling of contempt for the US and western values.

Wright for vice president. The \u201cDixiecrats\u201d managed to win many Southern states, but collapsed as a party soon after the election, with effectively all members returning to the Democratic Party. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat from the Southern state of Texas, led many Southern Democrats to vote for Barry Goldwater at the national level. In the ensuing years, the increasing conservatism of the Republican Party compared to the liberalism of the Democratic Party (especially on social and cultural issues) led many more conservative white Democrats in the South to vote Republican. However, many continued to vote for Democrats at the state and local levels ,especially before 1994. After 2010, Republicans had gained a solid advantage over Democrats at all levels of politics in most Southern states.\u201d\n\n[Southern Democrats](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Southern_Democrats) ","created_utc":1523467140,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

It's not \"theft\" it's just asset redistribution. It's not \"hiring based on skin color and gender\" it's \"affirmative action\".\n\n\n&gt;restricting your ability to discriminate\n\nOnce again, you call it discrimination because you're speaking a literal different language than conservatives are. You care more about the feelings of the situation than hard rights of individuals, and we can't get behind that.  \n\n&gt;like a woman\u2019s right to choose\n\nI don't think you have the right to choose if you kill the baby you created or not, however, I recognize that we're far enough gone with this that it will never be reversed. I would want non medically necessary abortions limited after 10 weeks, since the brain begins developing around that time. \n\n&gt;the rights of gays to marry\n\nI believe gays should not be able to force churches to perform marriages for them, but they should be allowed to be married in the eyes of the state if they wish, and have the same legal status. I am one, I should know.\n\n&gt;the rights of trans people to identify as they choose and use the bathroom they choose\n \nI have so many issues with this I'll have to number them. Read them carefully so you don't mistake what I'm saying, too.\n\n1) You're not a man or a woman just because you say you are, once again, redefining language does *not make it so*. What you *feel* on the inside or \"in your mind\" is a made up thing. Gender is not real. There is no mind\/body dichotomy, there is a body, and your brain controlling it. Your brain has a hormonal or structural problem and it makes you think your body is not correct. \n\n2) Nobody has a duty to call you by anything. If you look like a man or look like a woman, there would literally *never* be an issue with this. But if you're got 5 o clock shadow and a noticeable bulge, don't be surprised when you get odd looks when you're powdering your nose in the ladies room. I'm not going to call that a woman. You cannot seriously sit there with size 14 hairy feet in 3 inch heels putting you at 6'7 with an adams apple, and demand people call you a woman. \n\nI will reiterate: If you look like what you demand to be called, there would be *no* issue with this. I will not ignore reality for you, but I will not be an asshole on purpose if what you look like is synonymous with what you're demanding to be called. \n\n3)\"use the bathroom they choose\" See above.\n\n&gt;right to choose what drugs we consume as private citizens\n\nWhen your drug use creates criminality, it has to be made illegal. Hard drugs like heroin and opiates must stay illegal, but dumb shit like hallucinogens and weed should be legal, hard stop, everywhere, at any amount. \n\nSo to wrap it up, what am I trying to make illegal for you? I don't want you to kill babies. That's about it. I want to be the sole decision maker of my private property, and I want you to not kill babies.\n\nYou want: \n\nTo infringe on my private property rights\n\nTo infringe on my gun rights\n\nTo infringe on my free speech (but of course, silencing me and getting me fired and expelled is just the \"social consequences of my actions\", according to your type, the cop out for your shitty behavior towards whoever has the balls to disagree)\n\nTo seize an ever increasing portion of my assets to pay for your shitty social programs that never solve anything, and usually harm more than help.\n\n\nAnd then you have the nerve to act like you're fighting the good fight, and say things like \n\n&gt;You want to be a hateful bigot, You are low down scum, groveling in the dirt for scraps from your billionaire masters that tell you what to think and how to feel.

{"author":"thespicygay","body":"Oh dear. Honey, I graduated with honors with degrees in philosophy and political science, and I'm in the top of my class at one of the best law schools in the country, I know what liberalism is. It's pretty clear to me, however, that you don't know anything about American politics or theory. So, technically, both parties are liberal parties, in that both are built on a foundation of individual rights, liberty, etc., and this is due to America not having a feudal history where the conservative and liberal parties would have to distinguish themselves on the monarchy vs liberal democracy divide like how liberal parties originated in Europe. However, Americans use the term liberal in a slightly different way. It is an accepted political colloquialism to refer to Democrats in general as being the liberal party due to how the parties have distinguished themselves, particularly in the twentieth century on issues of civil rights, equality, and social welfare. It's with FDR that we see the Democrats really assume the mantle as the American liberal party, however, while it doesn't necessarily espouse European classical liberalism, it instead espouses a form of social liberalism emphasizing racial equality, a strong social safety net, and the idea that political and civil rights can only be secured through strong economic protections that secure worker's rights and liberty against the machinations of the wealthy. This strain of liberalism continued to develop in the post-WWII period up through LBJ with his Great Society. However, there was a divide at this time in the Democratic party. The more liberal, northern Democrats supported full civil and political rights for black people, however, southern Democrats did not. When LBJ signed the Civil Rights Act into law, it fractured the party between a liberal and a decidedly illiberal wing. Starting in the seventies, as part of the Southern Strategy, Republicans and comservatives began to court southern Democrats, leading to the realignment of the two parties and, by the time Reagan was elected, both parties had firmly established their modern identities as a liberal Democratic party that makes equality and rights its priority, and a conservative Republican party that has tried to impede the expansion of civil rights and liberties for minority groups in any way it can. So in short, you're wrong, and perhaps shouldn't come for someone who clearly knows more about this than you. &lt;3","created_utc":1523967745,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"Firegeek79","body":"&gt;\"if we were to pay this 330 billion per month by printing new money then this would end up flooding the market with cash and prices would go up\"\nThats a big \"if\" actually and I don't think thats whats being proposed.  Your absolutely correct,the value of the dollar depends in part on scarcity so printing more money will always cause inflation, thats a great point.  I believe this guy isn't suggesting that however.  Also, your correct in assuming that a luxury item like Starbucks coffee may try to increase their prices on coffee with the assumption that people would be willing to pay more.  Thats not the same as inflation though as long as the raw materials, coffee beans, transportation, water, paper, etc. stay the same.  Starbucks could change their prices but as long as JoeSchmo's coffee shop on the corner has a similarly good coffee at a cheaper price eventually Starbucks will lose customers causing the price of a cup of coffee to come back down.  As long as there are laws prohibiting companies from price gouging and other anti-consumer policies then I think inflation would be very minimal.  It's the same for raising the minimum wage, Conservatives have long argued that this would cause rampant inflation and it never has.\nTo your second point, I think that the $1000 number is important as that would put people with no other income right at the poverty line.  It would allow them to exist, not thrive, which would provide an important motivator for people to further their earning potential while not leaving them entirely destitute.\n\nEDIT: tried to format the quote above... can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.

The analysis is using survey data from patients and doctors and asking about how they *feel* the health care process went for them. General opinion of a system is not a good indicator of that system's success. What really needs to be analyzed are objective metrics, like average patient wait times, survival rates for certain afflictions (cancer, etc.), costs for those treatments and quality of care, not how people feel these metrics were for them personally. When you do this, I'm pretty sure the US ranks number one for wait times and survival rates, but is still rather expensive per treatment.

{"author":"Erozar","body":"They state exactly where they get their data in the methodology, which is where you'd expect an analysis' data gathering techniques to be explained. I won't copy paste the full thing since you clearly have access to the source material, but I'll tell you it's on page 28 and literally says the data come from surveys conducted in 2011 through 2013.\n\nTaking your remark into consideration, I also looked into exactly what these surveys were, because I still wasn't sure what they meant by 'survey.' It turns out the data collection methods used are some of the worst ways to collect reliable data - by telephone. Here are the sources I found that include the data for the surveys conducted from 2011 through 2013 (which are the data the analysis uses):\n\n***\n\n&gt;Telephone survey of representative samples of sicker adults ages 18 and older conducted from March to June 2011.\n\n-[The Commonwealth Fund 2011 International Health Policy Survey of Sicker Adults in Eleven Countries](http:\/\/www.commonwealthfund.org\/~\/media\/files\/publications\/in-the-literature\/2011\/nov\/ihp-survey\/pdf_schoen_2011_survey_article_chartpack.pdf)\n\n\n&gt;Mail and phone survey of primary care physicians in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States \n\n-[The Commonwealth Fund 2012 International Health Policy Survey of Primary Care Physicians](http:\/\/www.commonwealthfund.org\/~\/media\/Files\/Publications\/In%20the%20Literature\/2012\/Nov\/PDF_2012_IHP_survey_chartpack.pdf)\n\n\n&gt;Survey of adults age 18 and older in eleven countries.\n&gt;...Conducted by Social Science Research Solutions and country contractors (by landline and cell phone). \n\n-[The Commonwealth Fund 2013 International Health Policy Survey In Eleven Countries](http:\/\/www.commonwealthfund.org\/~\/media\/files\/publications\/in-the-literature\/2013\/nov\/pdf_schoen_2013_ihp_survey_chartpack_final.pdf)\n\n***\n\nIt turns out that all of the data the analysis uses is purely survey based. Now there probably is objective statements to be stated using this data, but we cannot in good conscience use it as a measurement for the quality, cost or effectiveness of medical care in these countries. We can only use it as to how the public *perceives* it. However, there is one survey that may be of some use, which would be the primary care physician survey. In it, it shows the US and other countries' access to electronic medical records, which is incredibly necessary in today's world. This is probably the only useful data that can be gleaned from all of these surveys, since it actually holds some use outside of opinion (of course, it is still a survey, so the data could still be disputed).\n\nI hope this further analysis into the analysis of the analysis of the surveys helps clear anything up for you, and I recommend looking into the links yourself, making sure I didn't mess up on anything. I'd hate to be wrong.\n***\nNote: Looking at the footnotes for some of their claims, I saw a lot of references to past surveys that they conducted. I don't know the merit of these claims based on those surveys, but judging from what I've gleaned from my meta-meta-analysis, it's probably not a good sign. I'd be careful with future claims supported by the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nEdit: Spacing\/Formatting","created_utc":1524106041,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

By culture, he means \u201ca set of generational customs, practices, and rituals that are grounded in local and particular settings\u201d.\n\n&gt; Deneen never spells out exactly what these local communities might look like, but it\u2019s clear that what he wants, in reality, is a return to \u201cupdated Benedictine forms\u201d of Catholic monastic communities...\n\n&gt; ...This gets at a broader problem with the sort of critique that Deneen and other conservatives level at liberals. They seem to believe the communities and cultures that liberals share somehow don\u2019t count.\n\n&gt; Between their museums, concert halls, universities and coffee houses, liberals also have their customs, practices and rituals grounded in particular settings. These \u201csettings\u201d might be found across the globe, much to the distaste of conservatives, but that is not to deny their existence. So it is not that liberals don\u2019t have their own cultural communities, it is that they have communities Deneen doesn\u2019t like.\n\n&gt; Tellingly, one liberal tradition that Deneen fails to mention is pluralism, which many liberals still recognise themselves in today. Pluralism holds that there are numerous competing and irreducible worldviews, and that the goal of politics is to find a way to make them work together.\n\n&gt; It is that pluralist project \u2013 building bridges between different communities \u2013 that is in most urgent need of rediscovery. What we need now is not a retreat to our own communities, which can only aggravate the polarisation of society, not to say give free rein to those already in power.

In the US, we have an ocean in the way, so the only way to get here is by plane. I do agree with a lot of the citizens of those countries that those countries are taking in too many migrants. I don't think the US should take in an unlimited number of migrants, but we can take in more than 10,000. A vast majority of Muslims who immigrate here are women and child. As for the other laws you listed, I'm not familiar with them, but they sound like something I would be in favor of.

What I think is that they should have right to it. We have plenty of space, plenty of resources. I\u2019m someone who doesn\u2019t mind sharing. I get that you aren\u2019t, but as a matter of preference (because I think it\u2019s both moral and doable), I am. \n\nb) I absolutely respect that people have to make tough decisions regarding how far they want to pursue their version of happiness when weighed against how much money they have. \n\nBut seriously? It\u2019s the illegal immigrants who are criminal freeloaders? Have you looked at the corporate tax cut that the GOP passed? The money siphoned from our economy - from you and your family, from your friends\u2019 family, my family - is staggering, and dwarfs whatever burden immigrants, illegal or otherwise, have on our country. \n\nHere, let\u2019s look at some articles together.\n\nFox News claims that LA County paid out $1.3 billion to \nillegal immigrants via these kinds of handouts over the span of two years.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/2017\/08\/03\/la-made-1-3b-in-illegal-immigrant-welfare-payouts-in-just-2-years.html\n\nThe Washington Times (hilarious name, by the way) corroborates.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.washingtontimes.com\/news\/2017\/aug\/7\/l-county-hands-13-billion-billion-illegals-welfare\/\n\nI didn\u2019t know that - that\u2019s a fair bit of money. But let\u2019s take this national. \n\nIn a piece titled \u201cThe Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers\u201d, Matt O\u2019Brien and Spencer Raley thoroughly dissect the cost of illegal immigration to our fair country.  \n\nhttp:\/\/www.fairus.org\/issue\/publications-resources\/fiscal-burden-illegal-immigration-united-states-taxpayers\n\nThey arrive at $114 billion annually - at least, I\u2019m assuming annually, they didn\u2019t immediately say - which is really quite a bit more money, isn\u2019t it? \n\nNow let\u2019s take a look at that tax break gifted to the upper crust of society just last year by the GOP held government. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.crfb.org\/blogs\/final-tax-bill-could-end-costing-22-trillion\n\nThis piece cites that the fiscal impact of the policy just put out will increase our deficit by $2.2 trillion over the next ten years, costing us taxpayers $220 billion annually. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.vox.com\/2017\/12\/22\/16812144\/gop-tax-bill-loopholes-cost-debt-irs\n\nThis site lists it closer to $1.5 to $1 trillion over a ten year span.\n\nIn one fucking policy, one fucking corporate tax break, the government spent as much to twice as much as it costs to support the entire illegal immigrant population residing in the country. If the GOP had only cut that bill in half and given the rest as tax breaks to your family, to my family, then bam! Bing-badda-boom! You would have no more worries about illegal immigrants costing you literally anything! It would all be paid for!\n\nBut nah, the GOP had to give that money to corporations, because naturally, that money leads to job creation, right? (Actually, you might very well think that. Articulating anything worthwhile on that front warrants another post).\n\nSo, my opinion of the cost of illegal immigration, is that it\u2019s peanuts next to the kind of money our country throws around on a daily basis. If you want less taxes. There are far better ways of going about doing that then by shitting on people who just want to come to America because of how fucking awesome it is. \n\nAnd it\u2019s now that I face the choice of whether I want to talk about how your argument seems rooted in racism. If you think immigrants are bad just because they aren\u2019t white and don\u2019t speak our language, I think you\u2019re a hateful person.

{"author":"John6507","body":"Thanks again for the response.  Now, answering your question, I believe that, on average, there are differences between the races due to genetic differences and\/or evolution.  So each race has on average some advantages and disadvantages depending on the comparison.  And whites have some genetic advantages (depending on the comparison) but they also have some disadvantages (depending on the comparison) like higher incidents of neurological diseases or in the realm of athletic performance on average they don't tend to jump as high or run as fast as some other races.  This is one reason why I believe blacks are overly represented in professional sports like the NFL or NBA despite having a much smaller population percentage in the US.\n\nAnd the above was really what I was referencing in my #2 point but to answer your question more broadly.  I think there is a question about at what point do quotas and other programs designed to achieve racial equality may overreach and actually unfairly harm whites or others.  Basically, we have attacked this problem only looking at nurture without considering nature.  For example, if there are differences in iq or other factors that explain performance differences in society, it would be unfair to punish whites or any race    after other impediments have been removed.  In other words, it is the difference between equal opportunity versus equality of outcome.  Like in the sporting event example, the overreach would be saying ok, blacks are \"overly represented\" in certain sports (through no fault of their own) and so we decide in terms of racial equality that teams now must take a set number of players from each race or require blacks to perform with ankle weights or something.

It's one thing if the response to the proposal to stronger background checks is \"muh principles\" followed by giggling and frolicking to a safe distance to yell \"gotem\".

I figure from there you would discuss why they do or don't. If someone says guns don't kill, people kill, That's a reasonable argument. It's just some weak ass shit in terms of actual persuasion. Anybody with a touch of nuance knows the individual rights advocate is focusing on the active participant's motives and actions while gun control advocates focus on the means through which they act. Both are important, but to what extent may not be viewed equally.\n\nAlthough nothing new has been added to the debate at that point, they have at least set the frame on what their focus is. Now you, also a reasonable participant I this conversation I assume, can discuss that argument that people are the problem if you'd like.

{"author":"jwgarcia82","body":"&gt;...they have almost no control over how much the public is willing to pay for their product or service.\n\nExcept this isn't entirely true.  The reason people are only willing to pay so much for a product or service is because they only have so much money to spend.  They only have so much money to spend because of what their employers pay them.\n\nBasic economics say that if people have more money to spend, they are willing to pay more for certain goods and services they find valuable.  If they don't make enough money, they'll start cutting non\\-necessities out all together, or reconsidering how much they're willing to pay.

{"author":"jwgarcia82","body":"&gt;Right now, 50 million Americans make less than $15 an hour. If Sanders\u2019s proposal were to become law\u00a0tomorrow, what would happen? Tens of millions of Americans would take government jobs, leaving their former employers in the private sector in the lurch and hampering productivity.\n\nOr.... You know... Employers would be forced to pay their employees a living wage or be forced to close their businesses due to lack of willing workers.  There's always that possibility.  Besides that, there is no possibility of Sander's plan becoming law tomorrow.  At best it would be a plan that was implemented over a number of years, giving time for private businesses to adjust to the change.\n\n&gt;...potentially causing an inflationary spiral as private employers face pressure to continue paying workers more for their labor.\n\nEmployers having to pay their workers more is a bad thing.... For what reason now?  I'd love for the author to explain how having more workers with more money to put back into the economy is a bad thing...\n\n&gt;A way out for the private sector would be to invest in automation, a good in itself, but surely an unwelcome unintended consequence for supporters of these proposals.\n\nNews flash! Businesses are *already* investing in automation.  Raising the minimum wage or a guaranteed jobs plan isn't contributing to that what\\-so\\-ever, as it's *already happening right now.*  The fact is, if a business can change over to automation and not have to pay wages or benefits, they will.  That's the way of the world.  It is now, and always has been.  Allowing businesses to pay poverty wages isn't going to change that fact.\n\n&gt;Then, there is the cost of the program, sure to be outlandishly high.\n\nMaybe, maybe not? Will it cost?  Absolutely.  Will it be unfeasible? Who knows? What we do know is that having millions of Americans without jobs, who are *not contributing to tax income* and having to depend on government assistance *is* expensive.  What the article seems to be forgetting, is that if more of these out of work Americans are given jobs, the cost of Social Services will decline, as these Americans now have guaranteed work and most likely won't need it \\(or at least won't need as much.\\)  They'll also be paying taxes and putting money back into the economy, which they aren't doing now \\(outside of sales tax.\\)\n\n&gt;One group of economists writing for the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says the cost would be hundreds of billions of dollars per year.\n\nPerhaps we can cut out a few of Trump's golf trips and stop paying for trillion dollar fighter jet programs for planes that have never even left the ground to cover it the cost?\n\n&gt;But their\u00a0[assertion](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/modeledbehavior\/2018\/04\/24\/yes-the-jobs-guarantee-is-absurd\/#e36c351afd05)\u00a0that the program would not crowd out any private employment is so incredible that it verges on academic malpractice.\n\nIf businesses who pay their employees poverty wages are forced to go out of business, then good riddance.  Let a company who will gladly pay their employees a living wage fill in the gap left by the rot that was cut out.\n\n&gt;...at the expense of *my opinion not based off of* sound economics.\n\nThere, fixed that sentence for ya.\n\n&gt;such as beefing up the earned\\-income tax credit\n\nYeah, because unemployed Americans are *totally* benefiting from the earned\\-income tax credit.\n\n&gt;Then, there is the jobs guarantee, a half\\-baked attempt at\u00a0*dirigisme*\u00a0that, if implemented, would have woeful consequences.\n\nWhich seems to boil down to \"but private businesses will have to close their doors if they have to pay their employees a living wage!\" Sorry, but I'm not seeing that as a \"woeful consequence.\"","created_utc":1525052728,"score":3,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"EddieFrits","body":"Here's my problem; I think we should have stronger gun laws, but when people come in with \"there's no debate\" and then go on to demonstrate that they have very little understanding of firearms, it really undercuts us.  For instance, what does \"military style\" weapon mean?  How can we effectively legislate against that?  Does it mean having a pistol grip?  Being made mostly out of polymer and therefore a scary black color?  Is it having a rail system so you can mount an optic\/grip\/flashlight?  Is it being the civilian version of a military rifle?  That would make a bit more sense but then all gun manufacturers would have to do is design a new rifle that's otherwise the same and be around that law.  \n\nThe other article you posted just talked about how .223\/.556 is more powerful than a 9mm.  That has nothing to do with the style of rifle, just it's calibre.  You can get a manual bolt\/lever action rifle that fires .223\/5.56; it's a cheap round to fire comparitavely.\n\nHollow-point ammunition also has no bearing to the gun.  A manual action gin will fire a hollow-point because that's a characteristic of the bullet, not the gun.  Hollow-point can also be safer than regular ammo because it is less likely to overpenetrate (go through your target or, if you miss, a wall\/tree\/etc.)\n\nAnd this article is hyperbole, because the author doesn't dictate what a mental illness is.  It also complains about suppressors, which is another red herring because they don't actually silence the gun; it's still rock concert loud, just not immediate hearing loss loud.\n\nI'm not saying that you're wrong to want gun control, I'm just saying that if you're going to come on as strong as \"there's no debate\" you should at least have a basic understanding of of firearms and terms.","created_utc":1525124582,"score":4,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"nookienostradamus","body":"Yep, everyone needs to read every single scrap of available evidence for both sides of any argument before forming an opinion! Disregard the one developed nation that keeps shrieking \u201cgun control doesn\u2019t work\u201d and the remaining developed countries consistently demonstrating that it does. By, you know, avoiding the same astronomical gun violence rates. Oh, and I chose \u201cmisinformed\u201d because \u201cmurder-enabling\u201d or \u201cmassacre-endorsing\u201d might be a little harsh for delicate widdle sensibilities. So many of these craven people shouting from behind their arsenals think the lives of school kids, curious toddlers, abused spouses, people at church services and live events are an okey-dokey trade for bragging rights and defense on the off chance  that the next non-white or female national leader is going to \u201coppress\u201d them by making them feel bad. Tantrum time. Why, they might just have to put down their Big Gulps and their Xboxes and \u201crise up.\u201d The Second Amendment is intellectually indefensible in the modern age, which is why there is such a shortage of intellectuals defending it. If guns mean more than people do to a person\u2014he can pat himself on the back for being both morally bankrupt and on the wrong side of history. Even if I abhor every word out of his mouth, I would still rather he lived to keep spouting nonsense than get mowed down along with his family at the theme park by some equally righteous and entitled twat with an AR-15.
