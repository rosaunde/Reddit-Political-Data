I think, when it comes to religious beliefs (as a fellow atheist), it\u2019s best not to say anything at all. And if you do, explain it to them as you just did to us. \n\nEveryone is entitled to believe in what they want to believe, and I think atheists are frowned upon by religious groups because we are believed to be anti-religion - which, at least in my case, I am not. I don\u2019t believe in the teachings of Christianity, or Islam, or anything else, but I\u2019m not against them either. I honestly don\u2019t care what other people believe in. \n\nI also think it\u2019s disrespectful to try and persuade others against their beliefs or just speak out against the teachings of different religions in general - even if their religion is, as you say, misogynistic and has had radicalized sects doing or promoting bad things. For most people, religion is also a part of their culture, so by criticizing their religion and pointing out all the bad parts of it, you are also inherently criticizing them too. \n\nWith this said, I also hate hypocrites, so if I do hear some evangelical type making negative connotations about Islam that could also be made about Christianity, or making wild assumptions based on nothing but their personal beliefs, I will just make my point to them in a polite, respectful manner. \n\nReligions already clash enough without atheists trying to throw our 2 cents in - unless someone specifically invites you to discuss the pros and cons of each religion.","created_utc":1517560421,"score":3,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

It\u2019s a summary of a passage from his book about what he claimed Jews were doing and the more accurate attribution could be with Goebbels. However, it wasn\u2019t the German propaganda technique at all. \n\n&gt; In fact, Goebbels' views were quite different than what this fraudulent quote suggests. He consistently held that propaganda should be accurate and truthful.\n\n&gt;In an address given in September 1934 in Nuremberg, he said: \"Good propaganda does not need to lie, indeed it may not lie. It has no reason to fear the truth. It is a mistake to believe that people cannot take the truth. They can. It is only a matter of presenting the truth to people in a way that they will be able to understand. A propaganda that lies proves that it has a bad cause. It cannot be successful in the long run.\"\n\n&gt;In an article written in 1941, he cited examples of false British wartime claims, and went on to charge that British propagandists had adopted the \"big lie\" technique that Hitler had identified and condemned in his book Mein Kampf. Goebbels wrote: \"The English follow the principle that when one lies, one should lie big, and stick to it. They keep up their lies, even at the risk of looking ridiculous.\"\n\nhttp://www.ihr.org/other/weber2011fakequotations.html","created_utc":1517660198,"score":8,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

The conservative-dominated state legislature lined up behind him and, with the passage of the largest tax cut in state history, immediately began to wean the government off income taxes. The expectation was that newly unburdened corporations and the rich would usher the state into a new era of unprecedented economic growth.

However, the lefts love affair with illegal immigration can be seen as racist, on many levels.  As I stated blacks are fighting for the same jobs and have a much higher un-employment rate, so telling them they need to support illegals because they are brown probably is racist.  BTW, you do actually see these types sentiments at BLM rallies, they are no fans of democrats.  It is fascinating because White liberals only see skin color, there is an assumption that blacks and Mexicans have \"the same interests\", but seem completely unaware that black citizens and Hispanic illegals in fact have very different, and often opposite, interests.   \n\nFurther, as many right wingers say, there does seem to be a bizarre sympathy the left has for the religious peasant working class of other countries (namely Mexico), and yet the religious peasant working class of America (hillbillies) seems to get nothing but scorn.

{"author":"novagenesis","body":"&gt; Yes, I am slightly conflating 2 issues. I agree DACA protections are not racist. However, the lefts love affair with illegal immigration can be seen as racist, on many levels. As I stated blacks are fighting for the same jobs and have a much higher un-employment rate, so telling them they need to support illegals because they are brown probably is racist. \n\nAnything \"can be seen as racist\".  Perhaps it helps to understand that many Democrat states have a different relationship with \"illegal immigrants\" than Southern Red States.  As a general rule, they're not \"taking blacks' jobs\" in many of those states.  \n\nAlso, what is a \"love affair with illegal immigration\", really?  DACA is about stuff that actually affects Democratic voters in a life-or-death level.  Other stuff like path to citizenship?  Well, to be honest, voting immigrant citizens usually vote Blue.  From a strategic viewpoint, it makes sense.\n\n&gt; It is fascinating because White liberals only see skin color, there is an assumption that blacks and Mexicans have \"the same interests\", but seem completely unaware that black citizens and Hispanic illegals in fact have very different, and often opposite, interests.\n\nI'm not a politician, but I'm both white and a liberal... I can't imagine that two different culture groups with two different backgrounds have \"the same interests\".  Both parties are trying to please a diverse base, and both make compromises to do so.  An incredibly significant part of the Democratic base gives a damn about DACA and about cleaning up immigration... And yes, liberals favor globalism, where conservatives favor isolationism.  It comes out in their immigration views.\n\n&gt; Further, as many right wingers say, there does seem to be a bizarre sympathy the left has for the religious peasant working class of other countries (namely Mexico), and yet the religious peasant working class of America (hillbillies) seems to get nothing but scorn\n\nThis is getting kinda \"even more out there\" from the discussion.  I'm not even sure what you're talking about... Are you targeting liberal politicians or liberal individuals here?  You realize that Democrats' social programs largely benefit rural poor the same as urban poor, right?  The ACA may have a lot of problems, but it did a lot of good for the impoverished in the states that didn't refuse funding (Republican) for it.\n\n&gt; By definition that poll also shows a small majority of democrats DO NOT think the DACA kids are worth a government shutdown.\n\nNope.  From the article, actually 42% didn't think so.  The gap was undecided.  It seems reasonable to an outsider that giving up on DACA could turn a few Blue states into swing states, but I'll be surprised if the fight would turn any blue states red.  \n\nAlso, juggling estimates against the numbers in the article, it *appears* a significantly larger majority of Democrat voters blame the Republicans/Trump for the shutdown, even if they think maybe the Democrats should give in.  I can only imagine what side they'd bend on.","created_utc":1518104570,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

The conservatives still want to weaken them.\n\nLike it or not, the Democratic party is the closest party to a Labor party that has a chance to win a US election right now.  But if it rebranded as entirely a Labor party, it would alienate a massive part of its base, just as if the Republicans rebranded as \"just for the religious\" or \"just for the rich\".

Afterwards, if they miss their plane flight home, then what should happen to them?\n\nNext let's clear up some potential background misconceptions. First, Your post doesn't seem to recognize the citizen/legal resident distinction. Next, most people enter the country legally, and then overstay their visa, making them legally equivalent to the above people who missed their flight home after visiting Disneyland. Last, [overstaying a visa isn't a crime](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/mar/15/florida-conference-catholic-bishops/being-united-states-unlawfully-crime/).\n\nNow that those are out of the way, I think countries should be generally permissive of foreign tourists, that they shouldn't be in the habit of paying for their plane flight home, and that they should be able to earn their own way back. This requires that they continue to be a legal resident. I recognize that this means many of them will end up staying here for years, given how little discretionary spending the rest of us earn, and that may mean they end up putting down roots.\n\nLastly, the type of immigrant I want most is the sort that will quickly put down roots, that won't commit any felonies and few misdemeanors, and will generally be a productive member of society.

From wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism): \"Terrorism is, in the broadest sense, the use of intentionally indiscriminate violence as a means to create terror, or fear, to achieve a financial, political, religious or ideological aim. It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence against peacetime targets or in war against non-combatants\". Mind you, I am fully for being able to duke it out with the police. If you agree to have a fight with the police, hell, you will find me not complaining at all. This is why the police has pepperspray and tear gas and fancy tasers and body armor. Heck, you sign up for it, you get what you paid for. You want it, the police want it, why should there be anything more about this? What I am disagreeing with intensely is when you involve civillians in this. If antifa attacks counter demonstrators with bike locks... If they set peoples hair on fire.... If they beat people lying on the ground..... I am sorry, the shoe fits. They are using indiscriminate violence to create fear and archieve a political goal.

{"author":"djinnisequoia","body":"First of all, I agree about the rule of law. In most cases and times, it should be supported. That said, libraries have a day once in a while when all overdue book debts are forgiven if you return the books. Municipal governments have days once in awhile when you can clear up a lot of tickets at a much-reduced fee. These reflect the realization that people do not always follow the law to the letter, and propose a limited adjustment to the rule of law in the interest of least harm done, or most utility. (Don't know if you've ever read John Stuart Mill. His stuff is bogged down in a lot of old-fashioned prose, but the basic idea is that sometimes laws cause more trouble than what they're trying to fix.) I think the DACA thing is in the same spirit. As an aside, I do wish that the \"rule of law\" were something conservatives were more willing to follow consistently rather than only when it suits them, but that's another conversation, and I don't want to get into a bunch of whataboutism here.\n\nWith respect to the rule of law superceding \"he was a nice guy,\" I see no problem with a policy of trying to focus on actual bad actors when pursuing deportations. The many cases I see in the news of loving fathers and little old men and hospitalized sick children being swept up by ICE and bumrushed back to their country of origin are not helping anyone to see your side of things. Sure, it's easier to ticket people going two mph over the speed limit, but wouldn't you rather they focused on people going 70 in a 25mph zone?\n\nAnd regarding your hypothetical compromises: I agree to most of the first part, except that a three-year-old who was brought here illegally and is now eighteen -- that's a citizen, to me. They might not even speak another language. Their internalized sense of self is as an American. They are participants in our culture and furthermore, have been paying sales tax all their lives. I don't see what good it does anyone to send them \"back\" to a foreign culture where for all intents and purposes they really don't belong. \n\nThe second part: A citizen is a citizen. If Dreamers become citizens and then commit a felony, why should their rights as a citizen be any different from yours or mine? Applying differential rights to any one class of citizen is a slippery slope that I believe it is dangerous to attempt. If you're talking about undocumented illegal immigrants caught doing a felony, yes, of course deport them.\n\nThird part: If by \"total enforcement of all other immigration laws\" you mean no sanctuary cities, no, I'm against that. I live in California, a state which arguably has a bigger stake in this issue than others do. That California itself is strongly in favor of sanctuary cities and fairly tolerant of our (illegal) immigrant population ought to tell you something. We don't feel this way just because we're a bunch of airheaded liberals. They are just not the kind of problem other people seem to think they are, and we largely don't get what people elsewhere are so worked up about.\n\nFourth part: End the drug war? God, please! *Please* end the drug war. There are many good harm-reduction models that we could adopt or adapt. Build the wall? I think the wall is mostly a way for the same group of crooked contractors to further fleece taxpayers. They would be rolling in dough cutting every corner to build a contentious and foolish thing we just don't need. That money is *far* better spent on things *the American people* need.\n\nFifth part: English-speaking immigrants? Why? Really, I'm serious, what is the reason for proposing this? Do non-English-speakers bother you? You must be aware of the countless examples of people who came here speaking no English and went on to invent things, open successful businesses, become leaders or entertainers or scientists or whatever. Really, unless you can articulate a sound rational support for this suggestion, I don't  feel I need to address it.","created_utc":1518209413,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"funkmagnet","body":"Fixed link to be easier to read. Here's a copy of the report, a pivotal meta-analysis presented at this year's American Economics Association Conference: https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sole-jole.org%2F17722.pdf\n\n&gt;none of the economists on these studies will tell you that this means that minimum wage increases can never lead to job loss, if that were the case we could make the minimum wage $80 an hour and call it a day. \n\nYes, the economy and the employment in a region is volatile. In policy though, we look for the changes that lead to net positive effects. The research shows that minimum wage increases lead to a loss of jobs that can't pay the new minimum and a gain in jobs at and above the new minimum. It's a net positive in the majority of instances. A lot of people still don't have insurance after the ACA, and a lot of folks prices went up, but the overall effect was a net positive on public health outcomes.\n\n\n&gt;It fucks you over if you don't have a job, and does nothing if you are middle class. \n\nHere you're saying that minimum wage kills jobs again, a classic Neil Cavuto line. This isn't the case. Reseach shows that it raises wages and has no net effect on employment - hence not fucking the unemployed. As for the middle class, this has nothing to do with them. You said the minimum wage was \"overrated as a poverty fighting tool,\" and the middle class usually aren't regarded as being impoverished. \n\n\n&gt;We're improving the lives of Americans or we're twiddling our thumbs\n\nYou may not care about the relationship between labor and capital, but it's the reason that wages have been stagnant and Americans are currently experiencing a decreasing quality of life, going deeper into debt, and struggling while the richest of the rich soak up all the economic gains. When it comes to materially improving lives, raising the minimum wage is the fastest way to do it for tens of millions of American working families. \n\n&gt;There is an ideal minimum wage, which should be found through economic research and not ideology. The ideal number is probably higher than 7.25, but should be set at the regional level and not just firing 15 from the hip and assuming it'll work everywhere\n\n$7.25 an hour is a poverty wages everywhere, so yes, economic research would agree with you that a correct minimum is \"probably higher than $7.25.\" Economists can argue about the efficacy of $15, and it's certainly not enough in places like New York City, but we already have a good idea about what a living wage should be and where (check out livingwage.mit.edu - it needs to be way higher almost everywhere). \n\nBut your search for a technocratic solution misses the bigger point that economics and the minimum wage are inherently political. It's really about asking \"what sort of society do we want to have?\" Do we think it's OK that companies can get away with paying pennies while taxpayers pick up the difference because their truly suffering employees then have to get public assistance? The reason that $15 was important was political from the start. Before that, the only increases being put forward we're incremental at best ($10.10 was as high as Obama ever went). In order to shift the overton window you have to make bold demands to get people excited and involved. If the Civil Rights movement had waited until it was the right time to talk about race relations in America, they'd still be waiting. \n\nAnd to get to the original post - what if we paid Congress minimum wage - I agree with you that it would just dissuade the working class from running. I think the best solution would be that, to enter Congress, you have to either give up your wealth or not have any in the first place. Let's get money out of politics! And let's start by ending the fact that something like 50% of them are millionaires in the first place. How can we expect them to look out for anyone but the rich if they're all rich to begin with?

The Democrats say they want bigger government for a variety of reasons, many related to social welfare, and when they get in power they tend to follow through on this. The Republicans say they want smaller government, and when they get in power they completely do the opposite. \n\nMy overall point in response to answering the question in this post is that it must be deduced that Conservative politicians are actually not as conservative as their voters and constituents would like them to be. \n\nThat is the entire reason that Donald Trump actually won the Republican nomination and then the Presidency. All he had to do to win the nomination was espouse views which were more conservative than the 12 people he was running against. He basically exposed his opponents as not actually having truly conservative policies. \n\n&gt;What's dishonest is pretending to have some kind of small government ethos to cut programs you don't like instead of just arguing against them on the merits, or suggesting an outlook everyone shares is exclusive to one group.\n\nYes this is the point, this is again why Trump won and why the Republican party has been in disarray for some time. To a lesser extent, this is why the short-lived \"Tea Party\" became a thing. The average conservative voter does not like that they vote for small government and then the deficit increases. Rand Paul's recent gov't shutdown speech was in this vain. He and his father are the kind of people I would consider as actually conservative.

Having your money increase under interest and holding onto bonds is much more safer than investing in stocks.\n- Interest rates have been kept artificially low to influence people to invest in the stocks after the great recession of 2008.

{"author":"data2dave","body":"Quick read of that shows an apples and oranges comparison- SNAP vs WIC. WIC usually goes mostly to single moms with kids who\u2019d be motivated to pick healthy foods for their young children. SNAP includes a lot of admittedly \u201cunemployable men\u201d from what I\u2019ve seen, even recent convicts who can\u2019t find work due to discrimination towards such and it\u2019s often temporary between jobs for men and women and yeah some have some income which SNAP only covers part of their food. Ignorance, stupidity etc also makes them less able to pick good food. But then there are those who just have low income from work and/or are retired only on Social Security which is too little to cover food after rent is paid. Should those who pick good food be penalized because of the stupid ones? \nSNAP doesn\u2019t cover cooked Pizza, rotisserie chickens and other cooked foods ready to eat as at a restaurant or in supermarket\u2019s food court. So why not ban sugary drinks and candy etc??? Because the Sugar Lobby is supporting Republicans while Democrats are for the poor having some rights as to Choices. So I think restricting bad food is okay as cigs, cooked food, and alcohol is already restricted. In case people didn\u2019t know SNAP is just like a debit card. Not \u201cstamps\u201d. It\u2019s all digital and programming tells the card what can be purchased and what can\u2019t (at least in most states as I\u2019m not an expert).

I don't think 'no more guns' makes much sense, particularly at this stage when criminals would easily out-arm the populace and even the police force. We're too loose with our transactions for guns. Obviously, don't sell to the mentally ill. Also, make people go through courses, proving not just their ability to use them safely, but more importantly their ability to show up to appointments like normal adults. This would be another filter for crazy people, and this would hopefully make people cherish their ownership of guns as a privilege more than a right. Then, make the penalties more severe regarding improper ownership of guns. You have to keep them locked safely somewhere, and you cannot sell illegally. Maybe even track the guns with GPS implants to reduce the second market. All of this will dry up the market for the most depraved of us, and it will make them much less accessible to the angsty teen that seems to be behind a plurality of these shooting events.\n\nAnd probably, in addition to those measures, a big movement to trade in guns freely for some money couldn't hurt.

Obama bent over backwards to bring republicans to the table, always gave them the benefit of the doubt and kept on reaching out to them and he was thanked for this by them completely lying and accusing him of never inviting them to the table at all. \n\nI think most liberals and democrats already know that the foundation of our democracy is compromising with those who don't agree with us. We'd all LOVE to find compromise on the myriad of issues and problems out there and we've tried and tried again in politics and in life to find common ground with them only to discover that there doesn't seem to be any. At all.\n\nEven on these problems we all agree on, like infrastructure or too much money in politics, their \"solutions\" are always so far out of line with ours and they refuse to accept any of the blame. Admitting fault is weakness to them and compromise is for pussies so the only thing they will accept is for the left/democrats to completely capitulate and go along 100% with their ideas and they call *that* compromising. They do this shit even when they are completely in the minority. Their opening position and their final position is always a complete nonstarter with the left because they are just being completely unreasonable and *they know it*. It's HOW they get what they want. It works. \n\nI don't think I've EVER seen an article like this one directed at the right, suggesting to *them* that if they want to continue to win in the future they should reach out to the liberals in the cities or the black, hispanic or muslim communities to try and find out why they are so misunderstood and to try to find common ground and heal divisions. No one ever asks them to do this. It's only our side that gets asked to, again and again. What they are really asking is for us to follow and not lead.\n\nIt's as if the authors of these kinds of articles already know that addressing an article like this to people on the right would be a waste of time. They know it wouldn't even get read.\n\nThis should be the first clue to them and to us that the only thing people on the right respect is force and standing by your principles. We need to form an equal and opposite reaction to them, not appease them. If they are going to stand opposed to any compromise on gun legislation, then we need to go full bore towards FULL 2nd amendment repeal (even if that's not really what we want). Watch how fast they'll suddenly be willing to comprise. If they want to kill Obamacare, we need to go HARD on getting universal healthcare passed. IF they want to end medicare we go BALLS TO THE WALL on basic income. \n\nI think that's how you win AND how you get compromise on the things you don't win.

This makes them inherently conservative because they are protecting rather than trying to do something new. This unites them with the upper class, who generally also don't want to change things. This is juxtaposed to the upper middle, lower middle, and the lower, all of whom believe the world (or at least, their world) could/should be better.\n\nSo, what protects their way of life? Sure, on a surface level, you can name everything that has been part of the old guard for a while: family values (even to the exclusion of non-family values). But just as important, in this time of great change, is job security for the types of jobs the middle class pursues. Jobs are emergent from several variables, including perhaps the gov not spending too much on welfare (keeping value of dollar high?) and the protection of industries via trade restriction. Hey, throw in a little bit about immigrants taking the existing jobs, and it's an even fuller picture. Trump has been nailing the heart of the middle class's desires the entire time, at least on the surface.

Do you know how hard it is to get a liquor license to sell? Spoiler: it can be REALLY hard sometimes. A license to sell guns is $200 for three years. A liquor license can range from $400 for a bar selling beer and wine to $14,000 and higher selling a full selection of liquor. Most cities require fingerprints of everyone owning at least 10% of the businesses, and require extensive documentation of the doors and possible entrances to the building.\n\nSo yeah, if the gun industry would follow the route the alcohol industry has been held to, I think that would cover almost everything everyone is asking for and more.

Never owned a firearm but always been in favor of empowering people with the right to own a firearm. I've since come to support full reform of gun laws if not repealing the second ammendment.\n\nIn ancient Rome and pretty much all ancient civilizations the government would not allow for citizens to buy and sell weapons. Even in that scenario the populous is fully capable of bringing down a government with or without it being fully armed, as history shows us, so the argument that the citizens need to be armed in order to keep the government from being oppressive sounds good but I don't buy it any longer.\n\nAs for people who hunt for sport and game, why would any hunter need a semi-automatic rifle? He wouldn't. In fact, what's the scenario where ANY citizen needs to own a semi-automatic rifle? There simply isn't one. Why not ban semi-automatic rifles then? I heard 2 of my state representatives recently in media separately come out and say that if you enact ANY gun restricting laws then it's a slipperly sloap and eventually all guns will be taken away. Do they really believe that, or was that just a convenient answer, or was it for the fact that the NRA has given millions of dollars to many congressmen effectively buying out their opinion? No matter the answer, that ain't right.\n\nAnd the politicians give the answer after a mass shooting \"let's not politicize this.\" you're a politician, you have literally one job: to politicize events affecting the populous. But it isn't the democratic politicians that cry foul when mass shootings happen, no it's only one party that does that.\n\nThe ability for citizens to buy and sell weapons has gone on for so many centuries in this country that even \"bad guys\" can own firearms now, so the need to own guns is self-fulfilling: good guys need to have guns because bad guys have guns. If we hadn't empowered people from the earliest days with the right to own weapons then bad guys would only have knives, hammers, etc to perform criminal acts with.\n\nThe idea of empowering citizens with firearms sounds good, but in practice it is just a powder keg waiting to be lit given enough time, which is where we are now and I don't know what the solution is because the reality of a fully armed population, good and bad, stable and unstable, exists now. But we for sure need way more common sense gun reatrictions than currently exist. And the idea that this is a mental health issue only: BS. \"Madness is like gravity, all it takes is a little push\" -the Joker. \n\nScary world, but hopefully people can start to see the politicians that are doing absolutely nothing to address the issue.","created_utc":1519068194,"score":-1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

IMO If the rationale for semi-automatics existing is for the hunter who misses their first shot then that should not be reason enough for semi-automatics to be sold to the general public. My recommendation if semi-automatics simply must exist? Allow them to only be owned by a hunting club and not any individuals, or you must own a current hunting lucense and you lose that weapon if your license lapses (yes, the government pries it from your hands). \n\nFurthermore, why should anybody own a gun that can hold more than 6 bullets? If for hunting let it be the property of hunting clubs and not individuals. To me these regulations sound reasonable.

On what criteria? To what standards? No, don't just say, \"the local police department\" or something similar. This training would have to specially designed because you're talking about non-professionals with guns in a building full of panicked children AND those \"specially trained people\" will be very likely facing a CHILD with a gun who is killing other children. We don't train soldiers for that. We don't train cops for that. So we're going to need special training, including not just the mechanics and theory of combat arms, but the psychology of killing a CHILD in an active shooter situation. If you don't understand why this is a problem, then you're very likely unqualified to be in this conversation in the first place. It takes years of training to condition a soldier to kill another human being on command, let alone a child. And when that killing occurs, it's usually in a warzone, alongside your squadmates, and while that engagement is very, very often chaotic, it can't be compared to the confusion and chaos of a building packed with screaming running children that you are supposed to be protecting. In a warzone, if your bullets hit a civilian, even a child, well, that's collateral damage. It happens. It can't NOT happen. That's war. But a school? Full of American kids? You starting to see why you'd need some VERY, VERY specific training? \n\nWho pays for it? Combat arms is a perishable skill, so how often is refresher training and re-qualification mandated? \n\nWho do these \"specially trained people\" answer to? Are they trained to work together? Or are they Lone Wolf McQuade? \n\nHow do you insure the school in this situation? \n\nBecause you going to HAVE to insure the school. \n\nAre the specially trained people personally liable for their fire? If they hit an innocent kid, if they kill an innocent kid or cripple him or her for life? Who's responsible for that? \n\nMoreover, is the \"specially trained person\" responsible for failure to stop an active shooter?\n\nWell? \n\nNo. No. Don't roll your eyes. You live in America (most of you). We are a litigious society. Somebody has to be responsible. You were trained. You had a gun. You failed to stop the shooter, when the grieving parents sue you, will the school board pay your legal fees? Or will the the school, school board, state take responsibility? \n\nSOMEBODY has to be legally responsible.\n\nWhat weapons? \n\nIt makes a difference, you know. Larger, high velocity rounds can penetrate body armor, but also walls, doors, etc, meaning increased chance of collateral damage in a building full of children. We made the cockpit doors on commercial aircraft bullet proof, are we going to do that with classrooms? If not, well, we're back to that question of who's responsible when the school gets sued for not protecting the students from stray bullets fired by their own teachers. \n\nSo, do you mandate acceptable weapons? Ammunition? Fields of Fire? Zones of responsibility. Or is it the Wild West?\n\nHow do the cops know who the licensed and qualified \"specially trained people\" are? \n\nThis hole is bottomless. \n\nYou are essentially talking about turning teachers into soldiers and schools into warzones. You would do everything, EXCEPT address the actual problem. Easy availability of high powered weapons of war. \n\nNow look, I did not say there shouldn't be armed guards in schools. I didn't say there should. \n\nLikewise, I didn't say teachers shouldn't be armed. Or that they should. \n\nInstead, I asked some VERY basic questions regarding the proposed idea of allowing or even mandating armed teachers and school personnel. \n\nI used to do this for a living. I've had advanced training and extensive experience in this area. I was trained by both military and civilian schools. I taught combat arms. I'm a gun owner. I have a concealed carry permit. I'm hardly anti-gun. I didn't suggest anything, one way or the other. Instead, I'm asking BASIC questions about this idea of arming up teachers and putting amateurs with guns in schools. Questions that any competent gun operator should ask.  \n\nYou want to put more guns, carried by amateurs, into a building packed full of children.

The vast majority don't belong to some special club, they just go hunting.

A large military, police-state and intelligence apparatus without 4th amendment protections clearly diminishes the effectiveness of the 2nd amendment in a way that people who reflexively vote for authoritarian politicians don't understand.\n\nThe flip side of this is that many liberals don't acknowledge that the\nthe 2nd amendment protected the right for civilians and private militias to have [cannons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_and_Honorable_Artillery_Company_of_Massachusetts), [own and operate warships](http://www.usmm.org/revolution.html) and own contemporary military weaponry of the time, including the [20 round repeating rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corps_of_Discovery#History) which President Jefferson outfitted the Lewis and Clarke expedition with in 1803. Just as the 4th Amendment should protect against unreasonable search of electronic communication (email, phone, text, data transfer) which did not exist at the time of the constitution, the 2nd Amendment also should protect the use of the people to bear arms which have a fundamentally similar role as those justified by the founders. An argument for additional \"regulation of the militia\" through backgrounds checks or banning specific weapons of mass destruction are fine but banning \"military style assault weapons\" which are glorified semi-auto rifles seems disingenuous compared to just arguing that the 2nd amendment is outdated and needs to be amended.\n\nThe other hypocrisy are authoritarians such as Dianne Feinstein who are fine with diminishing the 4th amendment, increasing the military and domestic intelligence powers, and reserving the 2nd amendment only for the government or the wealthy in the name of safety.","created_utc":1519198876,"score":8,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

I see we're grounded in reality. Look at Apple- they are doing many things to \"go green\" to the point where it's annoying.\n\nI'm curious what distinction you think there is between illegal markets and legal ones other than legality? Yes, businesses are organized legal revenue generation vs. organized criminal revenue generation, in fact in much of the world including the US, the two are largely entwined in several industries. If you don't believe me, feel free to try doing any kind of major real estate development in a major US city without bribing officials and/or engaging with local crime syndicates. It's why Trump has so many mob connections lol. \n\n&gt;I see we're grounded in reality. Look at Apple- they are doing many things to \"go green\" to the point where it's annoying.\n\n[Apple isn't even the most green manufacturer of personal computers, though you'll note my source is the hyper anti-mac biased people at macworld.](https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/complete-guide-apples-environmental-impact-green-policies-3450263/) They sure do \n\n&gt;Why stop at taxing? If that's your goal, make all automobiles illegal. Then we can use the military to stop all the other countries across the world if they don't conform.\n\nNah, I'm going with a more centrist approach than what I'd actually like. I'll go a step further, I'd fully endorse car control with the expectation being cities are car-free and most people rely on public trans.\n\nWe're already dealing with mass migrations due to global warming, and it's only going to get worse and worse as time goes on.

I live in California, and I went through the Obama years getting happier and happier because I felt I was seeing the better world we envisioned in my youth coming to life. The world around me was so encouraging -- black &amp; white &amp; Latino &amp; Middle Eastern people could all be friends (and visibly were); gay people could walk down the street holding hands, not in fear of their lives, and nobody batted an eyelash. Many important progressive agendas were not only being taken seriously and finally discussed, but even actually put into policy. Because I guess it's so different here from a lot of the rest of America, I had serious tunnel vision of which I was mostly unaware. When tRump happened and all these vile racists and Nazis came crawling out of the woodwork, I was completely blindsided. I had *no idea* there were still people who thought (or didn't think) like that. I thought that finally having women and people of color visibly in political office, in science and STEM careers, in professorships and judgeships and being your doctor or your lawyer or your banker, was bringing people into wholesome rational contact with people that they might hate or fear, and teaching them the truth, bringing about a gentle enlightenment. Wow. I guess not.\n\nI think that the demonization of the poor (and corollary crushing of compassion) is part of the whole process of the concentration of wealth into the hands of a smaller and smaller segment of society. People who have seen their wages and buying power stagnate and then shrink dramatically are lied to; they're being told that their former prosperity is being siphoned off by poor folks cheating on welfare, by social programs and the safety net draining the coffers of America, when in fact it is nothing of the kind. They no longer even care to keep up the thinnest of a veneer of a premise -- a matter of mere weeks after voting in a catastrophic tax cut for corporations and the extremely wealthy, they tell us they will begin cutting everything we care about, health care, Social Security, all of it, because \"we simply don't have the money.\"\n\nAnd they smile right in our faces. I have to wonder what the endgame is -- if they keep up this game to see who ends up with all the money, shaving off a narrower and narrower portion for all the other human beings to share among us, gathering a more and more gargantuan share into fewer and fewer peoples' hands, then what happens when one sick twisted bastard finally ends up with ALL the money and the rest of us with none?

Gun rights plays into this in multiple ways, so it is a perfect tool for republican leaders to simultaneously stimulate their followers to action and keep them in their place.\n\nThe most direct fear stimulated by gun rights is fear of not being able to protect your family and property in case of attack. On top of that, you have the second-level fear of Democrats taking away your guns. Then you get to conspiracy types of fears -- that Democrats want to disarm the public because they want to have a violent revolution of some kind. And it goes on.\n\nGun rights is absolutely the perfect issue for republican leaders because it allows them to use coded language to stoke all these fears. Though a very significant majority if the population, including the majority of republican voters, want to see additional levels of gun control, the value of this issue to foment the fear they rely on to stay in power makes it worth the risk of backlash for republican leaders. And of course, generous support from the gun lobby and NRA means they can be paid well at the same time.","created_utc":1519702540,"score":0,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

How were my objections \"knocked down\"? Those were all highly anecdotal, not statistically representative cases that were presented. Why rely on those anecdotes? There's plenty of data out there that would at least go further in supporting the thesis. There's plenty of data that shows that conservatives are hostile to protections guaranteed in the first amendment (probably more so than democrats or people who identify as 'on the left') but that isn't synonymous with wanting to repeal the first amendment. \n\nOne often sees conservative media headlines that say 'A Majority of Democrats Want to Repeal the First Amendment'... but when you read more carefully you realize that the poll actually just shows that they don't think \"hate speech\" should be protected.

Here's a decent collection of attitudes representing opinions on both ends of the spectrum that shows that when it comes to speech protections, support for religious freedom, protection of freedom of the press and political expression, conservatives (or at least Republicans) are indeed more hostile towards these principles than those on the left.\n[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2017/10/23/daily-202-the-corrosion-of-support-for-first-amendment-principles-started-before-trump-he-s-supercharged-it/59ed49b130fb045cba000926/?utm_term=.4fef78575784](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2017/10/23/daily-202-the-corrosion-of-support-for-first-amendment-principles-started-before-trump-he-s-supercharged-it/59ed49b130fb045cba000926/?utm_term=.4fef78575784)\n\n But none of that proves the original claim that \"Conservatives want to repeal the first amendment\"... unless by \"conservatives\" you mean more than one person identifying as conservative... in which case, yes, I'm sure you could find at least two conservatives who think the first amendment should be repealed.\n\n&gt; Sorry there\u2019s not convention where every Republican raises their hand\n\nThat's why we have polling... it's a much better way to gauge opinions at scale than to try to do so based on anecdotal evidence","created_utc":1519786707,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}
