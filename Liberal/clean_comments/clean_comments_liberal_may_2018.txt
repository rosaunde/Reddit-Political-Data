{"author":"jawminator","body":"&gt;I don't think the scale of discrimination against asian\/irish-americans comes close to what we did and continue to do to african-americans.\n\nI agree. What I meant is that a *similarity* could ensue.\nIf the immigrants just sat down and said \"fuck america, we were treated badly so we aren't going to even try to help our own situation\" then, idk.. american inter-race relations would be quite worse off. Yes black people were oppressed for longer so it's harder for them to help themselves, granted, but nothing is going to change if they keep lying down shouting help. \"I can't help you if you can't help yourself\"\n\nAlso, I don't think they are the more impoverished race because of racism. I don't think even the alt-right hate black people, they just want a nation that is segregated because they think caucasians have their own culture. I'm sure some of them have the racist white-supremacist view, but that's not the goal of their ideology... At least from what I've read. Regardless, the alt-right ideology is retarded. And the kkk is probably like 5000 people max. 300000000\/5000 = hardly any.\n\nAnyways, I think part of the reason that black people are more impoverished is because of the very policies meant to help them out of poverty. Welfare support for instance essentially promotes single motherhood so that they get more money. Which isn't good for the kids, nor for the next generation, etc.\n\nRooted from the 'being in poor neighborhoods' comes the fact that hard times breed crime, from more crime means more police presence, which in turn means more arrests for petty crime, etc.. that just goes around in circles.\n\nAnd rooted from that excessive police presence comes the hatred of police presence, which means rappers like Tupac and NWA... (That's really all I know, I don't like propaganda music... Biggie and wu-tang are good though) bringing that hatred of the police to the mainstream, and every single black man shot by a cop brought up by news media, and no mention of white people shot by cops despite there undoubtedly being more due to sheer demographics... Next thing you know every black person, regardless of societal standing is afraid that a cop will shoot them on sight or something.\n\nSorry about the essay, those are just my thoughts. \n\nI also think (and this could certainly be wrong) that most of the black people claiming victimhood are mostly entitled 20-30 something's from California and New York that aren't being discriminated against, have even more protection than white people by law (hate crime laws), and come from middle-high class families. The actual victims are probably too worried about other things to be complaining on Twitter and Instagram about historical injustices.\n","created_utc":1525213796,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"jawminator","body":"I sort of hit on the crime point in my most recent reply to travdwyer in this comment thread.\n\nRegarding the peonage thing, it says that was outlawed along with the end of slavery in 1867. Was a different thing done after? Anyways the people still around from that are 75-80yo minimum, and that's if they were kids during that time so they technically didn't live through that themselves. While it is unfortunate and disgusting, it doesn't affect today's generation.\n\nRegarding violence such as lynchings; again, while despicable and abhorrent, only ~5000 cases were known about (1300-1400 of which were white people). There could have been many more undocumented cases so I'll say ~10000 is fair. From what I found searching us census pop. Statistics for 1930-40-50-60 there were about 10 million black people. 0.1% of black people at most were lynched. 0.047% - 0.1%\n\nAgain horrible, and there should have been 0, but yeah, reality sucks.\n\nIn my other comment I gave my opinion that it's been policies that have kept poor black communities down. Whether by good intentions gone awry, or purposefully malevolent I have no idea. \n\n\n\n","created_utc":1525229004,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

If you spend a lot of time on political subreddits, you inevitably end up with a pretty dark picture of what the other side is like. I consider myself pretty centrist and spend time on both right and left wings forums, and both are guilty of exaggerating or disproportionately focusing on the evils of the other side. To the right, liberals are all welfare queens who are racist against whites, sexist against men, and intolerant of Christians. To the left, conservatives are all reactionaries who are racist against non-whites, sexist against women, and intolerant of muslims.

Or are you referring to his **smears on Mueller via tweets?**, the fact of the matter is, the President is allowed to air his private opinion to the public. *Do you think Mueller is going to let up on Trump because of this?* **Don't you instead think a veteran prosecutor will chase the target even harder?** I am eagerly waiting for the conclusion of Mueller's probe and letting the facts of the case be released to the public. :)\n\n**Treason?** Where is the evidence? What conspiracy theory are you guys chasing?\n\n**Past financial crimes?** How long ago? How come he didn't get charged then? Are there well known cases that you can cite for me?\n\n**Reek of money laundering?** In what event? Please cite a verified case where Trump (or the Trump Organization) illegally **laundered** money? **ALSO** on the subject of money laundering, did you ever wonder why big banks pay tens of millions to Obama or Hillary for a 30min speech? What information can the former President or the former Secretary of State provide that is worth tens of millions???\n\n\nPolicy? Ok.\n\n\n**HealthCare?** You are absolutely correct, Trump hasn't been able to do anything to healthcare, therefore **Obamacare remains the law of the land** so I agree with you, Healthcare as it currently stands has been an absolute disaster. Hopefully they will let Trump have a crack at it after the midterms.\n\n**Tax Bill**, everyone benefits from it mate. When you cut taxes by 2.5% for everyone across the board that means a person earning $100 takes an extra $2.50, whilst someone making $10000 will save $250. DOH!\n\n**Immigration Ban?** What was the matter with it? you are clearly an open borders advocate, in which you want anyone who wants to come here, come here. What Trump wants is a skill-based immigration system. Or are you referring to what the left has described as the **Muslim Ban??** The one that targets only 6% of the countries whose majority religion is Islam? Are you blind to the fact that the countries targeted, are nations that have serious problems of radicalized extremists. Or that the list of extremist countries was commissioned under Obama?\n\n**Spending Bill?** So you are angry that you got a less radicalized bill? Trump isn't really a Republican or a Democrat, he is a pragmatist. \n\n**Insensitivity to Race Issues?** Like What? Did Obama have sensitivity to race issues? Please list achievements Obama achieved for the african americans? I instead raise the fact that african-american unemployment is the lowest it has ever been. Thats not an exaggeration my friend. That is a FACT.\nPS. The DOJ is a federal entity, if you are referring to the dickhead asshole traffic cops, that is your local\/state issue. The President does not order the deputy or the police commissioner. These are by law, independent from the President.\n\n**Wall?** Why is it unneeded? Please do some research on the absolutely heinous criminal violence that is ravaging our southern neighbor. You must live in Oregon (Or Canada), if you are oblivious to it. I would rather not have kidnappings and be-headings on my streets. Mexico is a beautiful country, but the northern states have a very very serious problem, rather than let Mexico's war against the gangs enter its second decade hoping for a solution. We need to take concrete steps to safeguard out border rather than waiting for Mexico to solve the problem on their territory.\n\n**FCC** Net Neutrality is the biggest scam being pimped by the big corporations, the established corporations don't want competition, which is what its actually about. If Verizon starts limiting the speed of people using TMobile, guess what, that person is just gonna go to TMobile. Don't be a slave for the established IPs. Ask yourself, why are the biggest corporations in favor of keeping the playing field as is. Why would they argue for something that limits them? What idiots do they have running the ship at Time Warner and Comcast?\n\n**Discriminatory Immigration Courts** If you can give me one case of an immigration court discriminating against someone due to the color of their skin, instead of actual legal grounds I will be happy to retract it.\n\n**EPA rollbacks?** Did you know the vast majority of those \"vital regulations\" did not exist 2 years ago? What if I further revealed to you, that a lot of those federally protected land only became federally protected during those two months after Trump won, but before his inauguration, and the democrats were busy trying to get slap some points on the board before time expired?

{"author":"jeffp12","body":"&gt;why do conservatives show up when it's time to serve and liberals don't.\n\nThe left\/right liberal\/conservative divide is mostly geographical. Left in the cities, right is rural, and suburbs tend to be the most mixed. \n\nPeople raised in rural areas tend to be much more interested in and exposed to guns. I mean guns are part of their culture. People in the cities are exposed to guns mostly because we hear gunshots some nights followed by police sirens. So I think a big factor is simply that people raised in gun-culture are much more likely to be interested in military service. \n\nAnother factor is that the left\/right divide is largely based on education. Less than 30% of people with post-graduate degrees identify as conservative. So by the same token you can ask why liberals don't join the military, we can ask why conservatives aren't going to college (or grad school). \n\nI think it largely goes back to the urban\/rural divide. In the cities, I feel like we're culturally driven towards getting a higher education, especially going on to grad school so you can get a good career, and being in the military just isn't seen as a good career. Whereas in the rural culture, military, police, firefighter, etc are more seen as good careers. So the city kids are focusing really hard on school, go to good college, good grad school, then good job, while rural kids are the ones that are often thinking -- military service, then get GI money to go to college, then career. \n\nTo someone thinking that they want to get a masters or PhD or go to law school or med school, while the prospect of free college is nice, the idea of putting off college for several years is definitely not. If you have to do military service first, you're not finishing your post-grad degree until you're into your thirties, and that's if you make it. That several year break between high school and starting college is not going to make starting back in school easy. If you're interested in anything related to science math, that break is going to be tough to overcome. And it's important to know that while most kids don't go to grad school, if you talk to incoming freshman, most of them do plan on it. \n\nI'd also add that liberals tend to have a more cynical view of what the US military is for or how it's used, while conservatives tend to have a more naive view. Conservatives fall for the rhetoric about \"spreading democracy\" which I think is really quite non-sensical. So if you're a teenager thinking about college and you think Bush is fighting wars for oil, are you really gonna join the military? Military service isn't really seen as a great patriotic thing to do, like you said, \"show up when it's time to serve.\" I don't see the US military as really \"protecting our freedom.\" But rather exerting our global and economic influence. Not to say it does nothing good, but it's not some altruistic force for good. \n\nWhile you painted conservatives as \"show[ing] up when it's time to serve,\" I think it's a bit disingenuous to say that people sign up for the military purely to serve their country. I think largely they do it because they get a guaranteed job\/money, plus work experience and resume building, plus money for college. I mean if the choice is stay home and work as a pizza delivery driver with little prospect for advancement, or join the military, get a job for which you feel like you're earning some respect, have some pride in your work, and get money for college, it's not just this altruistic choice for the greater good, they're at least partially doing it for all those perks. People want jobs they can be proud of and feel like they're moving upward, and military service offers that, especially with college money. But if you have a negative view of the military or Bush's wars, you're not going to see that service as a job you can be proud of. And I'd add that military service is great work experience and resume building if you want to go into Law enforcement, which is again, a career that is held in higher esteem in rural areas than it is in urban areas. \n\nIf America were to be in a situation where our country were seriously threatened (and not by guys in caves on the other side of the world, like we were under threat of invasion), you would see a huge increase in enlistment from the left\/cities. \n\n","created_utc":1525384601,"score":4,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Conservatives are not nazis, the nazis were self proclaimed socialists: not conservative. What I\u2019m saying is that we should be tolerant of CONSERVATIVE OPINIONS, not Nazi opinions. Actually, the closest person to a nazi I can think of is Richard Spencer, who wants a white ethnostate and believes in all that separate but equal shit (racist, but still wouldn\u2019t be classified as a nazi), and he is a socialist. If you listen to him, he is actually far left. But hardly any liberals know this because they won\u2019t even listen to him. To effectively criticize a person\u2019s ideas, you need to first listen to the side that you will be arguing. I\u2019m curious, if you found an actual nazi, what would you want to do with them? Punch them? Yeah, that will change their minds. Lock them up for the rest of their lives? Have our tax dollars go to feeding and housing them, their ideology becoming even more radicalized in prison.

Republicans and Democrats are near exact opposites. If you aren't an American citizen, I'll forgive you for not understanding this.\n\nDemocrats don't do a damn thing that remotely compares to racism. Have you ever really experienced racism in America? Sounds like you haven't, especially since you don't know the difference between racism and discrimination. We don't even discriminate against them, we've simply stopped tolerating their intolerance, and there's a huge difference. Racism is rampant and unchecked on the right. Most on the right flat out deny being racist even when they blatantly make racist remarks and say racist shit. Most of them even condone the terroristic killing of peaceful protesters, and are regularly charged with assault against other protesters.\n\nBoth sides are NOT dumbasses, but one most definitely is. Republicans are objectively stupid, uneducated, bigoted, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, etc. You can play dumb and use the \"both sides to the same coin\" bullshit argument, but it's simply not true. One side has a relationship with science, logic, and reasoning; the other clings to gawd, faith, and opinions. If you actually did a little research on both parties, it'd be tremendously obvious which side is based around reality.\n\nI used to think very similarly to you. I used to sit in the center and call both sides idiots. But the more and more hatred that spewed from the right, the further left I moved. You just have to do some non-partisan research. Watch a YouTube video of an Obama speech and a Trump speech. If you can watch crap like that and still think the way you do, then you've got nobody to blame for your ignorance but yourself.\n\nAnother thing, we've tried negotiating and reasoning with these people for decades. We always start center\/center-left with them all the way to the right, and end somewhere on the right because they refuse to budge and we don't.

So there\u2019s nothing wrong with stock buybacks. Um, that\u2019s not a bad thing.\n\nAuthor's (correct, IMHO) interpretation:\n\n&gt; In other words: This tax giveaway to corporations was \u201cexcess capital\u201d \u2013 that is, they didn\u2019t need the money \u2013 so they\u2019re giving it back to shareholders. But \u201cthat\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d according to Mnuchin, because the largely wealthy shareholders who get that money will spend it and the economy will benefit.\n\n&gt; If that argument sounds familiar, it should. It\u2019s the same old \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d Republicans have been foisting on the American people for decades.

Much like the south utilized racism to justify slavery. The conservative political party is utilizing religion as the common cause, the constant message they deliver is that their religious liberties are under attack and it\u2019s evident in progression. The fact that the law now says they have to marry a gay couple is an example of that proof. \nTrump might not embody everything for Evangelicals, he\u2019s not a Bible thumper and if he was...well he\u2019d be their new messiah perhaps (Im being facetious). \nWhat Trump is, is authoritarian. Conservatives like authoritarians, they see them as people who don\u2019t care about compromise, they tend to dictate law as absolute. They need the authoritarianism to force society back to a time when most people went to church and everyone basically knew everyone in a society. This is also a time when White People dominated society and the other races where swept under the social rug. \nConservatives essentially see progression as lawlessness. They see laws as absolutes rather than interpretations. \nThey see Christianity as the fundamental building block in American society. Which I\u2019d argue is obviously the largest faith and the earliest western faith to land in the US by European settlers. \nHistorically America has been made up of many groups, one of the largest are the religiously shunned groups of Europeans such as puritans, Catholics etc. \nRemember much like racism and it\u2019s hate, it wasn\u2019t long ago that atheists were seen as communists.  Especially in the 50s. There was a very strong Evangelical push in the 50s. Being an atheist was actually un-American. At this time there was a very strong sense of nationalism tied to Christianity.

{"author":"shamrockpub","body":"2013 McCain supported Barack Obama\u2019s nominee for CIA, John Brennan despite his involvement in the very same program: \n\nThirteen Republicans wound up voting for Brennan, including five members of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Among the most notable were Sens. John McCain (Ariz.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.).\n\nAt the time of his nomination, liberal journal The Atlantic pointed to Brennan\u2019s robust participation in the same programs McCain references as disqualifying for Haspel. In fact, Brennan was more senior and more involved in the decision making process in carrying out the enhanced interrogation techniques: \n\nLast month, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved a report on CIA interrogations during the Bush Administration, when prisoners were tortured in violation of domestic and international law. \u201cThe report uncovers startling details about the CIA detention and interrogation program and raises critical questions about intelligence operations and oversight,\u201d Senator Dianne Feinstein, an occasional apologist for executive power, said after the vote. \u201cI strongly believe that the creation of long-term, clandestine \u2018black sites\u2019 and the use of so-called \u2018enhanced-interrogation techniques\u2019 were terrible mistakes. The majority of the Committee agrees.\u201d\n\nArizona Senator John McCain, another War on Terror hawk, is among the several elected officials who have publicly called for the report to be declassified, but Dixon Osborn of Human Rights First made the case best: \u201cTelling the American people the truth about torture isn\u2019t a task that should be left up to speculative reporting, Hollywood filmmakers, or publishing houses. It should be based on the facts. Thankfully, that report already exists. Now it should be made public.\u201d\n\nIn nominating John Brennan to head the CIA, President Obama has made it more urgent that the report be declassified. It is one of several sources that could help us to answer an important question: Are the American people being asked to entrust our clandestine spy agency and its killing and interrogation apparatuses to a man who was complicit in illegal torture?\n\nThere is strong circumstantial evidence that the answer is yes. At minimum, Brennan favored rendition and what he called \u201cenhanced interrogation tactics\u201d other than waterboarding. As Andrew Sullivan put it in 2008, when Obama first considered Brennan as CIA chief, \u201cif Obama picks him, it will be a vindication of the kind of ambivalence and institutional moral cowardice that made America a torturing nation. It would be an unforgivable betrayal of his supporters and his ideals.\u201d\n\nSo why the apparent double-standard for McCain? The Senator will have to answer that for himself.","created_utc":1526042446,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

That money is being taxed twice - once to for corporate income tax, and again on personal income tax. \n\nAlso - guess what you can lower your tax rate by simply incorporating in a country with lower taxes - typically best countries to do this are Ireland, Liechtenstein, Singapore, or the many Caribbean Islands with no income tax. Companies are only receiving the benefits on the money they repatriate to the United States (per your article).  \n\nI think progressive income and consumption taxes (taxes on high wages and luxury items) makes more sense than high corporate income taxes.\n\nDo you even have a job?","created_utc":1526263003,"score":0,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

To this day, democrats continue to defend her.  As if she's their best friend who needs a cuddle. Democrats didn't handle our sh\\*t. We tried to hand her the presidency as if it were a jewel she now deserved and put all our money on the wrong race horse.  This isn't about Bernie Sanders, or the FBI or her being a woman.  People hated her.  Completely and utterly hated her.  Who cares if it was fair.  We knew it going in and until we admit out loud that the democratic party made a huge mistake and should have backed someone with no past scandals that the public could get to know, with no preconceived notions, that clown may just win again.

{"author":"OctoberStreet","body":"An increase in housing prices is to some degree inevitable when the government is trying to implement a policy to increase housing provision. The reason the houses aren't being provided is because it isn't financially viable to do so. In order for it to become financially viable, someone has to be incentivized to do it, so someone needs to make money. By giving more money (or subsidies) to renters, you create a bigger possible cash source for those considering providing housing, so they are more incentivized to do so. Essentially, a policy like this will always make landowners richer.\n\nYou could try and solve this by, as you suggest, limiting the amount a landlord can charge. This is difficult though, because by doing this you reduce the incentive to rent out your property again. This gives the opposite of the desired effect, since now you are basically telling the landowner \"look, you should rent out your property because these people have money you could get\" and then saying \"oh, we won't let you take that money, you are only allowed to charge $x for your property\".","created_utc":1526665908,"score":-1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Here\u2019s a quick snippet from the study:\n\n&gt; Defensive use of guns by crime victims is a common occurrence, although the exact number remains disputed (Cook and Ludwig, 1996; Kleck, 2001a). Almost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010). On the other hand, some scholars point to a radically lower estimate of only 108,000 annual defensive uses based on the National Crime Victimization Survey (Cook et al., 1997). The variation in these numbers remains a controversy in the field. The estimate of 3 million defensive uses per year is based on an extrapolation from a small number of responses taken from more than 19 national surveys. The former estimate of 108,000 is difficult to interpret because respondents were not asked specifically about defensive gun use.\n\n\nSo there is inconsistency in the data among all studies, but the vast majority show that defensive gun use is a common occurrence.

{"author":"calthopian","body":"&gt;I don't think that would happen. \n\nReally? Because Neighbourhood Councils and suburban city councils are full of people who put up barriers to housing construction. And while I'm in favour of greatly increasing density in urban areas like LA, people who own homes are more prolific voters than renters and increasing density in their neighbourhoods will lower their property values. There aren't a lot of home owners who are willing to lower their property values, not only is it likely to put many underwater on their mortgage but for those who won't be underwater it means they have less collateral to get money for a remodel or to start a business.\n\n&gt;Honestly, I am skepical just how many of those people are truly Democrats, and I really don't think there are enough NIMBY Democrats for it to make a difference.\n\nDefine \"true Democrat\" because many of the wealthiest neighbourhoods in areas like West LA, Palo Alto, and Westchester, NY are represented by Democrats and provide the Democrats with large margins in elections. \"Resistance rockstar\" Ted Lieu represents lots of West LA, including Santa Monica, Brentwood, Malibu, and Beverly Hills. Adam Schiff represents the Hollywood Hills, Silver Lake\/Los Feliz, and West Hollywood. These areas are some of the most affluent in Los Angeles and represented by some of the biggest names in the House Democratic Caucus not in leadership. They're also neighbourhoods in which NIMBYs have frozen development and pushed gentrification into other parts of LA like poorer South Los Angeles and East LA. You start having the national party attack their property values and you'll start seeing an uptick in support for Republicans. And its not just rich people. Poor neighbourhoods also protest new development because of gentrification and demand affordability concessions that make development uneconomical. And I know you're not going to tell me that voters in areas like South LA and East LA aren't \"True Democrats\" are you?\n\n&gt;Also, being stronger on this issue would bring in and energize a lot more anti-NIMBYs into the party. It has all the trappings of a classic economic justice issue, really - working class renters getting screwed by rich rentseekers - and smart policy change, that Democrats can run on, can fix the problem. It would be a big political victory.\n\nExcept the economic justice types are hardly blameless. They also advocate against market rate housing construction which most people in the rental market are subject to. Moreover, there really isn't much of a role for federal involvement in the housing crisis. Sure, HUD can build more public housing, but they can't force a community to upzone neighbourhoods to spread the availability of such housing geographically. It's been clear that cities and neighbourhoods can't be trusted to act in good faith with regards to housing, so the issue is probably best handled at the state level. The problem is that when state level solutions are proposed, every municipality comes out against it and puts pressure on their state reps to vote against it. See what happened to SB 827 in California. Rich NIMBYs came out against it because the idea of the state forcing them to allow denser development on transit lines would impact their property values and poor NIMBYs came out against it because increased density would create space for market rate housing which raises fears of gentrification. \n","created_utc":1526792091,"score":3,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Being blind is a medical concept. So what? It doesn't have anything to do with what were talking about here.

I am in no way a believer in gods or demons but, like any educated person, I have read The New Testament and I was capable of understanding that the whole thing is a liberal manifesto. \n\nTell your grandfather that all of us desire lawfulness, security, fiscal responsibility, national defense. All of us yearn for peace and safety for our community and our families. We all want more concerned and involved citizenry. And none of these things conflict with liberalism. Liberalism can be summed up with the Bill Of Rights, The Golden Rule and the well known response... Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. \n\nTell your grandfather that we are REQUIRED by our heritage, our ethics and our humanity to help others that are in need. We are not required to aid only those unfortunate who are worthy. We are required to render aid them all.\n\nI have simply stated the facts that are known. If your grandfather wants to aver his gaze, ignore his duty, fill his heart with hate and fear then, perhaps, he should screw his MEGA hat firmly on his head, nurture his fears and cower behind the wagons of that ilk.

And this to my way is ideal. And everyone believes in the freedom of the bathroom. It should be right there in the Constitution. But if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing. You have to set up, you have to set up times for each person, you have to bang at the door, aren't you through yet, and so on. And in the same way, democracy cannot survive overpopulation. Human dignity cannot survive it. Convenience and decency cannot survive it. As you put more and more people onto the world, the value of life not only declines, but it disappears.

{"author":"rohank101","body":"Citing footnote 14 from the actual study \n\n\"14We note that the magnitude of our main result is halved when we control for the application of a mandatory minimum. We view this result as an underestimate of the true racial gap in sentencing given the potential endogeneity of this decision although racial gaps in the application of a mandatory minimum by political affiliation are economically small (see Appendix Table A4). Another way to bound the contribution of mandatory minimums is to multiply the Judge Repub*Black coefficient from Appendix Table A4 (0.8 pp) with the average effect of a mandatory minimum on sentence length for black offenders sentenced by Republican-appointed judges (81.0 months). This back-of-the- envelope calculation suggests that racial gaps in the application of a mandatory minimum can explain at most a 0.65 month racial gap in sentence length by political affiliation. We note that this magnitude is substantially smaller than the main effect we find in Table 4 (3.0 months).\"\n\nNow, mandatory minimums are used for violent crimes involving class A, B, C and D felonies and class A and C misdemeanors. Now, there were 1.25 million violent crimes reported in 2016. It seems highly irresponsible on part of the researchers to omit that figure from their main effect calculation. A 15 day ratial gap after adding this figure is nowhere near as statistically significant as a 3 month gap. \n\nDon't blindly listen to whatever the media tells you.

Here's a snapshot of [where their voters stand](http:\/\/www.people-press.org\/2017\/10\/05\/4-race-immigration-and-discrimination\/).\n\nNone of those statistics show proof of bigotry. Bigotry may very well be the underlying cause of the discrepancy but the stats don't prove that.\n\n&gt; Calling it a plank of their platform was metaphoric, but bigotry is defined as intolerance of those different from you.\n\nHere are some definitions of bigotry...\n\n&gt;intolerance toward those who hold different opinions from oneself: *the*\\* difficultie*s* *o*f combati*n*g prejudi*c*e a*n*d bigotr\\*y.\n\n......\n\n&gt;obstinate or intolerant devotion to one's own opinions and prejudices **:** the state of mind of a [bigot](https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/bigot)\n\nBigotry in and of itself is not a bad thing... it depends on what you're bigoted towards. For instance, I have no problem being intolerant of racists... one should, in my opinion be bigoted towards racists. However if someone is a racial bigot, that's obviously bad.\n\n&gt;Their attempts to suppress minority votes, deny LGBT rights, encode religious extremism into law, deport or denigrate immigrants, promote nationalism, encourage authoritarian means of governing ethnic minorities, and push back against women's equality all qualify as bigoted.\n\nI think that labeling these things as bigoted is just a losing strategy... maybe with the exception of the suppression of minority votes \\(when it can be proven it's targeted towards minorities, such as in NC\\) and denial of LGBT rights. At this point bigotry really just means that you have a difference of opinion with someone over a moral stance. When you say that a christian republican is bigoted towards gays, they will simply say...'no, I love them and don't want them to go to hell for acting on their same sex attraction... it's you who's not showing them love or compassion for allowing them to go to hell'. Obviously that's a ridiculous argument but many people believe it... I think it's more effective to go to the source of the disagreement rather than simply calling someone a bigot... it just doesn't work to change people's minds and doesn't say very much about the nature of the disagreement.\n\n&gt;Their [denial that there is even a bigotry problem](http:\/\/time.com\/4837972\/race-gender-discrimination-perception-gap-republicans-democrats\/) prevents them from recognizing discrimination, so they continue to support bigoted policies. They are not the only group in the world where bigotry can be found, but their policies are steeped in it.\n\nAgain, I think you're just speaking the wrong language here... instead of arguing about whether or not discrimination exists... speak to specific policies and data that shows discrimination....\n\nAlso, what's up with calling me and others \"invaders\" simply for asking you to explain your position further?

Especially when you factor in unintended consequences.  Accidental shootings account for about 500 people per year, if you save all those people that leaves you with another 500.   There are about 2,000 self-defense shootings in the US per year by civilians, how many of those people would be killed or become victims of a serious crime?  This doesn't account for crimes stopped without firing, or crimes that never occur because of the possibility of a victim being armed.

You nicely cherry picked the one conclusion that perhaps supports some of your position while in the next paragraph this appears:\n\n&gt;Even when defensive use of guns is effective in averting death or injury for the gun user in cases of crime, it is still possible that keeping a gun in the home or carrying a gun in public\u2014concealed or open carry\u2014may have a different net effect on the rate of injury. For example, if gun ownership raises the risk of suicide, homicide, or the use of weapons by those who invade the homes of gun owners, this could cancel or outweigh the beneficial effects of defensive gun use (Kellermann et al., 1992, 1993, 1995). Although some early studies were published that relate to this issue, they were not conclusive, and this is a sufficiently important question that it merits additional, careful exploration.\n\nSo whether or not there are \"defensive\" uses of handguns, the net rate of harm could be much higher.

Considering the UK tried regulation leading to banning. Now they need \u201cKNIFE... regulation\u201d because the violence didn\u2019t stop. \n\nThe problem is solved in two places. \n1. At home. Discipline your damn kid and teach them respect for other human life. Im heavily conservative and with that being said, i think liberals are absolutely bat shit crazy. HOWEVER, i would never allow my kid to grow up thinking that, or any other reason should warrant any sort of initiation of violence to anybody. No matter who they are or what the situation. \n\n2. At School. I witnessed teachers when i was in school brush off bullying so many times it made me want to put a hole in their wall. Bullying needs to be taken far more seriously than this bs system schools have now. Teachers need to make a bigger effort to reach out to kids effected and confronting bullys. How they arent immediately expelled by now is beyond me. Lessons need to be learned.\n\nMy point being: the issue is simply just shitty human beings. Thats something that is never going to change. No lifeless object being ignorantly banned will fix that. Idk what is so hard about blaming lack of accountability. But that alone is the answer. If you cant prevent something, all you can do is be as prepared as humanly possible to stop it and deal with it if the situation arrives. The threat will never go away and thats a fact.
