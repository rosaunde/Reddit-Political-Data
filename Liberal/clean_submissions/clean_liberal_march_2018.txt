One person mentioned that they agreed with Democrats on marijuana legalization.\n\n&gt; ...I am finding it harder and harder to find common ground, as they keep going farther off the deep end...\n\n-----\n\n**Communists** mostly found no common ground with libertarians.  Some found common positions in:\n\n* opposing US military interventions\n* opposing the two-party system\n* favoring LGBT rights\n\nThen they banned me from r/communism without explanation.\n\n&gt; ...I can see how libertarians can develop leftist politics but as it stands their lack of understanding of economics prevents that.\n\n-----\n\n**Libertarians** found many areas of agreement with communists.\n\n* opposing US military interventions\n* the right to bear arms\n* aiming for a stateless society\n* strong workers' rights\n* opposition to fascism\n\n&gt; I agree with their ideal...but I recognize that [it] will never happen and that every attempt at bringing it about has resulted in tyranny.\n\n-----\n\n**Republicans** and **Democrats** did not respond at all.\n\n**Conservatives** did not get a chance to respond, as their moderators removed the post.","subreddit":"Liberal","title":"Results of asking about opposing political views"}

Probably will not do anything about automation, most likely will do something about immigration, nobody is talking about Industry Structure and that is really the focus of my interest.\n\ndebt\n\u2022 noun 1 a sum of money owed. 2 the\nstate of owing money. 3 a feeling of\ngratitude for a favour or service.\n-Oxford English Dictionary\n\nIf you owe the bank a hundred thousand\ndollars, the bank owns you. If\nyou owe the bank a hundred million\ndollars, you own the bank.\n-American Proverb\n\nEverything is a bubble because there is an overall lack of work to be done in the economy due to lack of consumers translating into lack of demand for goods and services; vicious cycle  et cetera.\n\nWell, what is the culprit? Here is the actual right answer: Industry Structure / Core competency theory of the firm hollowing out the economy. Because Intellectual Property is the only profit center when you farm everything else out to the world, all other activities done by a firm are being treated as a service *outside of the firm* and this creates the bimodal distribution that is causing the economy to be so low for so long, because those activities when done outside the firm have an additional set of investors, additional set of people taking a slice, and leaving less room for a weekly paycheck for the same activity. Also, activities done outside the firm are subject to a higher level of competition than something involving an interview process, so in this additional way, the \u201clean\u201d industry structure exerts downward pressure on wages. We are too efficient at doing work, and therefore a lot less effective at creating one additional job in the economy.\n\nSome have argued that this new bimodal distribution (tale of two cities) is a more truthful representation of a meritocracy than a normal distribution, since we run up against risk/excellence pretty darn frequently, whereas bankers in the 2000s and 1990s and I guess the 1980s thought of risk in particular as being normally distributed, and therefore bad things go down very infrequently. Well, maybe if you are discriminating against the risky guys, and not giving them loans! But long tail risk is much more common than that. If you are not anticipating long tail risk, such as if you are a pension holder at United Airlines, and UA is allowed to default on 9 billion dollars in pension obligations to their employees / slaves. Then you are not only creating moral hazard, you are creating a situation where debtors are taking enormous levels of risk, because the creditor class is not actually taking any risk. Debts therefore will always need to be paid, regardless of whether it is a bad loan. Because the debtor is considered to be the one taking the risk, rather than the creditor. Sovereign nations are paying back debt at many times the principal. If you have payed 100% interest, a debt obligation should be considered met. That is not the system we have. All religions have condemnations against debtors not meeting their debt obligations, but they also all condemn usury. Even the word evokes images that are too harsh for polite company. \n\nFor this reason, it makes zero sense for Trump to take credit for the economy. Obama bought at a low. Trump bought at high. So, there is more downside than upside to tethering the evaluation of the President's performance to the state of the economy, because these metrics also goes down on some years. We are also too close to evaluate, because we do not know what the future brings. There are bubbles everywhere in a world where growth is much lower than what we expected previously, when we were making investment decisions based on that expectation of growth/return. Indeed, the stock market is not the economy, and so the recent gains to the real economy have been modest. However, we talk about labor market tightening up without respect to the quality of those same jobs, or the sustainability of the growth, or the equity of the growth. The Fed is raising interest rates so that employers don\u2019t lose the whip hand. The central problem has *not* been solved.\n\nThe biggest problem is industry structure; ie, the difference between GE in 1960 being the most profitable and largest employer, versus today where Apple employs only tens of thousands of people. But the scope of the conversation is limited to an infrastructure program built out with American steel. Getting that piece right doesn't preclude missing the part that bites your ass. Will it be sovereign debt? Will it be student debt? Regardless of the bubbles, the core competency theory of the firm or competition is what is hollowing out the economy. It's profitable toi a fault, and in the case of MSPs are rarely more effective than doing something in house.\n\nThe way out of the Great Recession is for firms to do more in-house, such as Elon Musk doing basically everything in-house, outside of farming out frame production to Thermo-Fusion in Newark. On the other hand, when firms instead engage something as a service, the activity in question becomes even more a cost to be minimized, rather than an asset to invest in (Human Capital). There is still an overall lack of demand for people to do work in the economy, and it is because there is an overall lack of consumers. The economy turns into a godless surveillance machine when the only buyers are oligarchs and governments. Anticipate a techlash against the firms who are not employing enough Americans, and importing Asians because they are better spatially, allowing those same firms not to do any job-training in-house while also investing in campaigns to make the price of software development labor cheaper, such as school programs training more software developers in public school with our tax dollars et cetera. That is far too lean. Google is responsible for Google\u2019s pipeline of labour, not the US federal government. Maybe if they were a patriotic firm, caring about their interests would make sense. But they are not. The money has already crept in, and google is a bad actor that has never received any sort of public response, except from the Republicans. Is a bimodal distribution inherently prone to class warfare? It certainly seems the case. Attacking the big four tech companies would be the most meaningful step toward fixing our spirit, because we are only as good as our citizens. We need to hurt the people that have been hurting us. Most of all, because they are a powerful symbol of what the economy has become, and somehow, everyone and their dog understands that the automation, industry structure, immigration, and most of all the general progression of information technology that allows us as a group of skilled workers to do more work for less money. There is nothing to be done about automation or technology, but immigration and industry structure are the sorts of contours of the market the the feds are able to shape.
