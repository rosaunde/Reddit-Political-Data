{"author":"jwgarcia82","created_utc":1511308474,"num_comments":2,"score":5,"selftext":"Rep. Denham, \n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t know you\u2019re a corporate puppet who will do whatever your wealthy donors want you to do, but for better or worse you are our \u201celected\u201d official, so I won\u2019t let that stop me from voicing my concerns anyway.  Even if I don\u2019t believe it will do any good\u2026\n\nBut regardless, the reason I\u2019m writing is to voice my concern about the upcoming battle for net neutrality.  Ajit Pai (one of Trump\u2019s hand-picked sycophants at the FCC) has made the claim that the regulations that stop corporations like Comcast, Verizon, Time Warner, and AT&amp;T from throttling internet speeds for websites they don\u2019t like, or those they want to extort more money from, somehow stifle innovation.   This outrageous statement is just flat out absurd, and I think even those of you who have sold yourself to the highest bidder know that.  Free access to the information that the internet provides is what fuels innovation.  \n\nWhat *actually* stifles innovation is our elected officials handing over control of the internet to a few corporate juggernauts.  What will hinder innovation, is not having free access to information as we have since the internet made its debut in the world.  What will hinder innovation, is a corporate giant like Comcast deciding it wants to block our access to websites that refuse to pay them a fee every month.  Claiming that removing regulations that were put in place to stop them from doing so will somehow promote innovation is, as I said, absurd.  \n\nIt\u2019s not that I think writing a letter, begging you to stand up for net neutrality will do any good, because I know it won\u2019t.  You\u2019ll just ignore the voice of your constituents as you have since you were first elected.  No\u2026  I\u2019m writing in hopes that this will, at the very least,  remind you that you don\u2019t serve whatever \u201cdonations\u201d you receive from your corporate donors, but that you actually serve us\u2026 The American people and those of us in California.  You are where you are today by the grace of those who voted for you, so when you go to cast your vote on a decision that could potentially destroy a tool that has become an integral part of all of our lives (including yours), think ahead to the next election, and decide if the voters will forgive you for making the incorrect choice.  Think about the outcome of the election should those internet giants suddenly decide to stifle your voice. Then just vote accordingly.  This decision will affect you just as much as it affects the rest of us.  \n\nRegards, \n","subreddit":"Liberal","title":"My Letter to Jeff Denham about net neutrality"}
