{"author":"AkiTendo","created_utc":1537988852,"num_comments":23,"score":1,"selftext":"The last month and a half has seen quite a bit of posting and tweeting about Alex Jones being tossed out of the social media sites on his ear. Cries against censorship have been voiced, but I find them misguided.\n\n# Freedom of Speech\n\nSimply put, the government will not curate speech. Many people seem to believe this is somehow freedom from the consequences of speech - but nothing could be further from the truth. Alex Jones' business empire is being crippled because people no longer want to associate with him at all. People don't want to listen, so they walk away. Companies do not want to publish his materials so they ban him from their sites.  The First Amendment is not a restriction on corporations though - only on the government and its agents. Occasionally companies do serve the government - and when they do they become bound to the restrictions the government must abide by (see below). All individuals and most companies are free to shun you if you cannot be civil, as Jones' is finally discovering.\n\n# Freedom of the Press\n\nThe  first amendment protects free speech, but it also protects free press.  Free press means a publisher cannot be prevented from publishing anything AND the reverse - the government cannot force a publisher to publish something.\n\nIt's very important to note that when wingnuts get control of governments - be they on the left or right - one of the first thing they invariably do is seize control of the press.  That isn't simply a matter of preventing stories from being published - it also involves forcing the press to run favorable propaganda for the controlling wingnuts.\n\nThis truth made the whole social media hearings last month a farce. Any law Congress might pass to regulate what Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and others do would be a violation of their rights as publishers and unconstitutional.\n\nAlex Jones and his following can cry all the crocodile tears they want - they frequently ban people from forums they control who challenge their views without a second thought. This power to kick someone off a platform never goes away no matter how big the platform.\n\nAnd as monolithic as these platforms may seem, they are castles built on sand.  If they censor users too much those users can build new sites of their own, so long as the internet is a free and open platform and no one's traffic has priority over anyone else's. Something, very ironically, Alex Jones' opposes out of ignorance...\n\n# Network Neutrality\n\nWhich brings me to my last point. I've seen some call for Alex Jones' Internet Service Provider (ISP) to be found and forced to shut him down. This violates the doctrine of network neutrality which forces ISP's to follow the same laws as the government.  The reason they are so bound is they are direct agents of the government by working directly on the physical infrastructure of the net. They have government granted monopolies within the various cities and  municipalities. These grants make any censorship dictate they make effectively government censorship, which is unconstitutional.\n\nIt is a violation of Jones' freedom of speech to deny him a connection to the internet.  They don't have to provide him a server or a co-location, but he can still set up a server and run it out of his own home or business. Access to the Internet in our technological age is an inviolable part of Free Speech. \n\nThe role of an ISP is analogous to the Postal Service, not a publisher. The Postal Service cannot refuse to send newsletters (or even newspapers, though the cost by weight would be prohibitive) to people regardless of what is said in them. The analogy even goes a step further in that the Postal Service isn't allowed to even open the mail they carry, similarly ISP's cannot easily thwart transmission encryption that maintains the privacy of both sender and receiver.\n\nSo this too is a free speech issue, and the Republicans as ever have made themselves enemies of free speech by removing network neutrality.  I've really never understood this - it's the dumbest thing the right has ever stood for. I chalk it up to sheer ignorance that they don't understand that 90% of their viewers are dependent on ISP's owned by the very same big media companies they hate and rail against constantly. They are ignorant of the fact that in the absence of net neutrality those companies could take their programs off the air (Their radio feeds are transmitted to the broadcasting radio stations over the Internet). It's something that has always amused me - that they support the right of their greatest enemy to shoot them in the head (metaphorically).","subreddit":"Liberal","title":"Alex Jones, Freedom of Speech, Freedom of the Press, and Network Neutrality"}
