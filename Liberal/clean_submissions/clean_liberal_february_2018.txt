As an atheist I think the abrahamic religions at their core have a lot of problems and are extremely misogynistic. (I\u2019m sure some eastern religions are too but I don\u2019t know enough to speak on it). So it would be extremely hypocritical of me to criticize Christianity for sexism/misogyny without doing the same for Islam. HOWEVER I find that most people in the United States who openly criticize Islam are far right Christian xenophobes who A. are huge hypocrites because their religion has a lot of similarities and B. are using \u201cwomen\u2019s rights\u201d as a way to disguise their xenophobia. Both of which piss me off and I don\u2019t want to be lumped in with those people. \nA summary of my beliefs about Christianity AND Islam \n1. Both religions are pretty darn sexist\n2. Both religions put double standards on women when it comes to dress\n3. HOWEVER I fully support women who PERSONALLY CHOOSE to follow rules about dress because it is their choice \n\nI\u2019m hesitant to voice my disapproval of Islam though because there is already a stigma against Muslim people in this country that I don\u2019t want to add to, they are more often discriminated against and stereotyped than Christians are.

The 2nd amendment right to \u201ckeep and bear arms\u201d does not equal an unlimited right to own any and all types of firearms. Even the most ardent gun rights supporters acknowledge and accept this; you don\u2019t see many people arguing that machine gun ownership should be legal. Under this same logic, a ban on military-style assault weapons clearly does not contravene the 2nd amendment. The 4th amendment, however, unequivocally states that searches require a warrant based on probable cause. Thus, the warrantless searches and surveillance authorized under the PATRIOT Act and FISA Sec. 702 (which Congress voted last month to reauthorize) patently violate the 4th amendment. Yet many of the same individuals who steadfastly oppose an assault weapons ban on constitutional grounds have no problem with, and even strongly support, such blatant violations of the 4th amendment \u201cfor our own safety.\u201d To me, this appears to be the height of hypocrisy.
