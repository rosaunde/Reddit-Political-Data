I only ever broke party lines during the last presidential election. I never voted for Barack Obama, though I found him to be an alright president as time went on. I even worked for a Republican senatorial campaign.\n\nI also worked in EMS, and saw several victims of sexual assault in my time working there. I objected strongly to Brett Kavenough, to the point where I have just been permanently banned from r\/Conservative over using the phrase, \"God help you\" in response to his supporters. It is for emotional reasons, I will admit. I believe Dr. Ford off the basis of her testimony, and my own personal experiences with Kavenough's alma mater. But, more importantly, I also cannot deny that this is a man who does not belong enforcing fair and impartial law.\n\nI've never been a Democrat. I'll be perfectly honest, I still don't like most of the policies you all seek to enact, barring healthcare. But I can't stand by and watch while the division of government is torn apart. Scalia would not have abided by it. I know many of you dislike him, but if there is one thing he made explicitly clear regarding his judicial philosophy, it was a profound belief in the necessity of avoiding the consolidation of power into a single party in the three branches of government.\n\nI'm voting Democrat for the second time ever next election. And if I am, I'm sure some others of us are doing it too. One day, I hope to see a government that represents me, but that seems far off.\n\nWe aren't all bad, all of us. In the words of Obama, there's hope.\n\nPlease be gentle with those who are still on the fence.

I used to be pretty deeply involved in the liberal camp, but my views have evolved over the years and now I consider myself a leftist. I mean no disrespect, I'm just curious about what the liberal views are on some things and I think this sub is a good place to ask! \n\nBTW, when I speak about nationalism here I'm talking more about civic nationalism, rather than ethnic, religious, or cultural nationalism. I doubt many people on this sub are ethnic nationalists. \n\nWhat are your thoughts as a liberal on patriotism and nationalism? I know that's a pretty broad question. \n\nAre these values desirable? Harmful? \n\nAt what point does patriotism turn into nationalism?\n\nShould liberal politicians promote patriotism? \n\nIf you are patriotic, do you think that this is at all in tension with your liberal values? Could the protection of individual liberties inherent in liberalism perhaps be at odds with the somewhat more collective goals of nationalism?\n\nAny other thoughts on patriotism and nationalism? I'm really just curious to hear some more liberal views on these matters.

My question is how would you do it and what should it cover?\n\nSo I feel like housing, food, and water are all easily yes, the argument comes when you get into healthcare and communication and things similar to that where one could argue it is necessary although by strict interpretation it\u2019s not. I\u2019m under the impression that if America were to do UBI it\u2019d replace all other social programs so no more social security no more Medicaid or Medicare and no more welfare or food stamps. I guess the core questions I have are,:\n\nWould it be money that could only be spent on such items (whichever we agree is necessary) in the same way as food stamps? Or would it be more you get a check every week and spend it however you see fit? \n\nWould there be an opt out or transfer option? Like if someone who\u2019s sole or primary source of income was UBI decides they\u2019d rather live in a better house or better neighborhood than have healthcare would they be allowed to do that?\n\nAnd should it vary depending on where you live, and if so how micro should we go? Someone living in California has a higher living cost than someone in say Texas, however I\u2019m sure there are counties in Texas that have a higher cost than some counties in California. Should this be a factor and how small should we go, state, region, or all the way down to county?\n\nThanks for any replies hoping we get a good discussion going!","subreddit":"Liberal","title":"How would you do UBI?"}

If you want a society with fewer abortions, your only choice is to vote for Democrats. That is the only party with a platform that will actually reduce the number of abortions - access to birth control, comprehensive sex education, expanding access to health care like Planned Parenthood (most importantly prenatal care), even affordable education and early childcare\/welfare\/food stamps to provide economic assistance after birth make a huge impact on the frequency of abortions. Not coincidentally, these are the planks of the Democratic platform.\n\nThe Republican answer is to simply ban the medical practice, which doesn\u2019t prevent abortions but makes them less safe for the mothers. Outlawing abortions also fails to acknowledge the instances in which abortions are a medical necessity or the least bad of two choices. It\u2019s not a good choice, but is one that many hopeful mothers are forced to make - when the genetic or ultrasound tests show that the fetus will not survive the pregnancy or the birth. It is a terrible decision but one that a mother\/father must make with the physician. Sometimes that heartbreaking choice is not available until after 20 weeks. The Republicans insert themselves between a women and her OB\/GYN with unnecessary testing and sometimes force the physician to lie.\n\nI understand that some people see this as a black and white issue, but as with most things in life, the practice is quite gray. There are legitimate, medical reasons for abortions or induced miscarriages, and they are all sad and terrible. If if there wasn\u2019t a medical reason, this should be a decision a woman gets to make for her own self, her own body. The answer isn\u2019t to make the women criminals or punish the physicians. The answer is to make the practice an unnecessary as possible and that is where Democratic policies win the argument hands down.","subreddit":"Liberal","title":"Pro-Choice is the Only Choice"}

Their arguments were that Christians are just as oppressed if not MORE. They said because of what the kkk did and other things, most everyone hates Christians. I was dumbfounded. How the fuck can you compare Christians to muslims in terms of oppression. Sure everyone frowned upon the KKK and what they stood for but by no means are they on the same level as muslims. When a Christian sits next to you on a plane do you hope your breath for a second or two? When a bombing happens does everyone automatically point fingers at the Christians? When you see them in public, do they feel every eye on them? Of course not. I am neither liberal or conservative. I see the light in both sides.
