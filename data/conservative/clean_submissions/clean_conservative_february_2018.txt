It has shown me a few things about people that I wouldn't have expected given my prior interactions with them.  I was out with some friends, having a drink or two (No more than 1, it wasn't the booze talking for anyone.) when the topic of conversation got onto Trump.\n\nI was really surprised when my friends talked about the President and his family, the administration, and Conservative values.  (Violence, judgements based on appearance, ridiculous scenarios, etc.)  I didn't really say much during this portion of the conversation, which was noticed by my friends and used as a prompt to question why I wasn't participating.   I did not expect to hear this kind of stuff out of these people, who I know are normally smart and rational.  \n\nAt present, it seems like one needs to completely reject the current administration and ALL of its policies in order to not get a label.  I can't tell someone that I agree with some of Trump's policies and disagree with others.  It requires total rejection.  In fact, today at work I was told \"don't tell me you're one of THOSE people.\"  (I did not prompt this conversation.  I said I liked some of what he's doing, and dislike some of what he's going.  I left it at that.  I make a point to NOT talk politics at work, if at all possible.)\n\nIt's amazing how polarized things are.  I am generally a quiet person, but I'm getting tired of hearing about people constantly ragging on Conservative values and policy positions.  Of the people I've met, most of the intolerant are on the Left.\n\n    ","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I am surprised - Assumptions and uncharacteristic conversation"}

{"author":"regularguy98b","created_utc":1517508428,"num_comments":3,"score":18,"selftext":"This is a quote I recently heard in one of Dr. Jordan Peterson's videos. The man is brilliant, and this statement really struck a chord with me. However, I'd like to expand on this a little bit more, partly to rant about some of the frustrating things I've noticed of late, and just to share my personal thoughts on this statement. \n\nIt is true that many conservatives and Republicans tend to apologize for their views. However, it goes beyond that. Not only do many conservatives apologize for holding the opinions they hold, but also, when confronted with a liberal Democrat on the other side, they instantly become meek and defensive and try to either minimize the importance of the views that they hold, or to make it abundantly clear that the views they espouse are not as right-of-center as the liberal might think. For example, you often see conservatives saying things like \"(states political stance), but that's just my opinion,\" or \"I believe (states political stance), but I'm not suggesting that (describes alternative political stance that the liberal they are engaging with would consider \"extreme\").\" I've seen this happen in a number of settings, from instances in which one of my conservative friends was talking informally with their liberal friend at a house party or a liberal stranger at a bar, to more formal instances, including talk shows that involved esteemed and distinguished conservative speakers with reliable credentials. Also, this form of defensive statement is particularly common when the subject being discussed is particularly controversial, and forms a main plank of the liberal PC platform. Examples of political issues being discussed in which I've noticed this mechanism being applied recently include: metoo, feminism, Black Lives Matter, abortion, and the Second Amendment. This is wrong on a whole number of levels, including:\n\n1) Liberals almost never do this. If you listen to any of these discussions, you'll notice that conservatives tend to employ this method of speaking far more often than liberals do. Unfortunately, by doing this we are not only ceding power to the liberal(s) we are speaking with, at least in the context of that particular interaction, but also unintentionally reinforcing the system of toxic political correctness that we are trying to eliminate. If we want the concept of political correctness to be removed from public discourse, we can only achieve this by being vocal about our political opinions, and unafraid to state them when clashing with opposing views.\n\n2) By instantly admitting that one does not hold the most conservative possible opinion on a given subject, one is instantly denying themselves the opportunity to catch their opponent in the act of strawmanning, which refers to your opponent misconstruing or misunderstanding your opinion into one that they consider to be more extreme, more simplistic, and one that they consider easier to defeat in the course of an argument. By preventing them from falling into the straw man trap, you are not only losing a chance to embarrass them and make it more difficult for them to win, but are also in a sense helping to perpetuate the notion that only conservatives can commit this fallacy. This is a favorite tactic of liberals, who like to point out instances in which conservatives fall into this and other traps involving cognitive biases, since they then argue that liberals do not commit the same errors, which they then use to perpetuate the myth that they are intellectually superior to us and that conservatives are generally stupid, when in reality we are often so defensive over the course of any extended conversation that we deprive ourselves of any opportunity to actually grab the initiative and win the argument and catch the liberals making the same mistakes they accuse us of making. And when they do make these mistakes, we are often too meek to call them out for it and acknowledge them.\n\n3) Holding unpopular views is not morally wrong, nor is it illegal. By cutting oneself off from certain views, one is suggesting that these views are not socially acceptable and that holding them would be egregious. This not only promoting the PC view that certain views should not be permitted, but also alienates our fellow conservative brothers and sisters who may hold views further to the right than we do on the political spectrum. Of course, there is nothing wrong with stating your opinion, and if one's opinion is more centrist than the average conservative's, one should certainly feel empowered to clarify that, but this should not be done using overly defensive language that inadvertently disenfranchises people farther to the right of the political spectrum on that particular issue.\n\nThat's just a few of the reasons why I think the way that conservatives conduct themselves during political conversations need to change if we are to reduce the role of political correctness and bring about real change. I could go on for hours about this, but the post is already long enough. Basically, we need to stop being ashamed of our conservatism and wear it on our sleeve, being proud of our views and remembering that they are in every way equal to the views of the liberals we discuss them with.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"\"Conservatives need to stop apologizing\""}

{"author":"rey-de-nutka","created_utc":1517613020,"num_comments":13,"score":19,"selftext":"I'm a college freshman, and this quarter, I'm taking a course on cultural anthropology. I genuinely enjoy college and the experiences that it provides, and I genuinely like the subject of cultural anthropology - because it helps you understand cultures that may be vastly different from your own.\n\nOne of the key concepts that continually recurs in our cultural anthropology class is cultural relativism. Cultural relativism holds that each culture develops its practices (song, dance, language, manners of dress, literature, food, etc.) in response to a very specific context of demands and pressures placed on a human population, and that all cultures' practices are equally legitimate expressions of culture. \n\nAn example of this is the Inuit natives of Greenland having hundreds of words for different kinds of sea water conditions that don't exist in English, because their livelihood depended on hunting marine animals to eat - so knowing and communicating the precise sea water conditions is extremely helpful to assure successful hunting.\n\nToday, we had a discussion about medical pluralism as it relates to cultural relativism. Medical pluralism advocates that we should consider medicine from multiple cultures, and not box ourselves in to our own medical practices. The majority of people in the class agreed with the premise, but I spoke at length in dissent against the concept.\n\nI said that cultural relativism works very well in some scenarios, such as developing rapport and non-judgment when conducting fieldwork to study a specific population, but that the idea of cultural relativism falls short in other areas. I said that medicine was one of those areas, as it is not a field that particularly minds cultural sensitivities or political trends, as it's a purely biological matter: since some things are objectively better for your body than others.\n\nI said that for example, some forms of medicine are objectively more legitimate than others, and that medicine is not a fixed set of practices that never change: instead, it continually evolves and changes as we discover new medical techniques and practices that are more effective, refine existing practices, and discard practices that are pernicious or ineffective - in an iterative process that happens over hundreds of years. For my examples, I cited vaccines being used to stop viral infections, and the proliferation of antibiotics (such as penicillin) to stop bacterial infections as modern forms of medicine used in the Western world, and the obsolescence of bloodletting and leeches as legitimate forms of medicine. \n\nIn response, my classmates called me racist, ethnocentric, and closed-minded. Yet, all that any of them could offer in response were tired anecdotes about how \"my brother saw a naturopath, took some neutriceuticals, and he was all cured!\" or nonsensical political rhetoric about how \"the big pharmaceutical companies control everything.\" or \"I never had the flu once in my life, got vaccinated, and got the flu!\" They conflated my condemnation of cultural relativism as universal truth with being racist toward other cultures' medical practices.\n\nI think many of them missed the underlying point: cultural relativism works well, but it too has limitations, and it can't be applied to everything. Medicine is one of those fields, and there are some medicines and medical practices that work objectively better than others.\n\nI mean, I love college and all, but some folks around me are totally dependent on the professor for their reasoning skills.

People last year were hesitant and perhaps a little apprehensive of Trump's pick for Haley as UN ambassador. She already made some highlights for herself in giving 0 fucks for the UN, like their denouncement of the Cuba embargo:\n\n&gt;\u201cLet\u2019s be honest about what we really see going on here,\u201d Haley said. \u201cThis assembly does not have the power to end the U.S. embargo. It is based in U.S. law, which only the United States Congress can change.\u201d\n\nBut she really shone through when the UN almost in unison denounced the US for Trump making the move that every president promised on their campaign run, but never did: move the US embassy to Jerusalem. \n\nAnd with that, Nikki Haley made, in my mind, one of the greatest speeches in response to the UN.\n\n&gt;will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in the General Assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation. We will remember it when we are called upon to once again make the world\u2019s largest contribution to the U.N.\n\nTo me, it's very refreshing to see someone correct the reality that it's the US that runs the show, not the other way around. It's wonderful to see someone stand up to the UN for their hypocrisy and calling out their bullshit.  Much better than the grovelling US apologists from before.\n\nShe then got her named dragged through the mud by the sleeze merchant known as michael wolff and many others because the other side can't stand the idea of a woman that has a backbone. Yet, nevertheless, she persisted. ;)\n\nI look forward to more from her. Hopefully the next great speech from her in the future is the US leaving the UN and letting it crumble. \n\nHave a great weekend everybody.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Sidebar Tribute: Nikki Haley"}

I don't know if you saw the news today, but the Republican party basically admitted it no longer cares about fiscal conservatism (they want to approve $300 billion in new spending while only cutting $100 billion, and this is on top of the tax cuts - check it out here https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/02/spending-deal-deficit-hawks-congress-384968?cid=apn).\n\nI am a moderator on the sub /r/modernwhigs, and we represent supporters and those interested in the Modern Whig Party. The Modern Whigs were founded in 2007 by disillusioned members of the US military, who were at the time serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. The party's aim is to provide evidence-based solutions to the issues currently facing America. You can read more about the platform on action.modernwhig.org/platform, but the main goals are balancing the budget, increasing investment in public education, increasing investment in infrastructure, and providing what is effectively universal healthcare. So other than the part about education, not that different from the Republican platform - except that we actually support a balanced budget. And we have a world-renowned economist who can confirm our policies eliminate the $200 trillion fiscal gap (if you thought it was $20 trillion, you're wrong. It's way more serious and increasing spending is possibly the worst thing the government can do right now. You can read about it here https://www.npr.org/2011/08/06/139027615/a-national-debt-of-14-trillion-try-211-trillion).\n\nAs a centrist, I very strongly support what they advocate for, but I also think all conservatives should consider joining the party. There is currently one member of the party running for Congress in Virginia, so I encourage you to also check that out. You can read about it at http://action.modernwhig.org/virginia_whigs_nominate_peter_carey_us_congress. Our party chair also recently wrote a response to the State of the Union, which you can read at http://action.modernwhig.org/whig_response_to_state_of_the_union_speech?recruiter_id=11170.\n\nIf you have any questions, pm me. It would also be great if you could get involved, pm me about that too.

Democrats, who are supposed to be the party of the little guy and underdog, just sitting there with resting bitch face doesn't help their image.

I went to the emergency room and look how much they charged me! Trump is evil!\n\nMe: Then I'll send you $20 and you can start managing a fund to pay for people's medical care.\n\nA: You just don't get it, do you? Let me call in a friend who is an actual doctor.\n\nDoctor: I don't know what point you're trying to make is, Mr. A. Most of medical expenses end up funding the staff. Doctors make very little.\n\nA: But if we cut doctor's salaries, wouldn't that lower costs?\n\nDoctor: I work for less than I am worth, and I spend a lot of time helping poor people, and my family is struggling with bills just like everyone else. When I do get paid, it's not as much as you think. Cut even the best doctor's pay in half, and you're only knocking a few dollars off of the medical bill.

Not different than any other type of politician of course, but you have to understand that I thought we were on the right side. I started getting politically active when I was 18 in 2004, when we invaded Iraq. I found it simply unjust that we were fighting there with no evidence they were related to 9/11. I still don\u2019t. But my na\u00efvet\u00e9 equated that to the Democratic Party - despite lots of its politicians voting for an Iraq invasion - was simply morally superior. We were on the right side and that kept me going.\n\nPlease note that I am black and trans. This is relevant only in so far that I just felt that I naturally had to side with the left on all things because \u201cthey fight for and with me\u201d. It shaped an idea in my head that traditional values, things like that wasn\u2019t for people like us because people who expose that mentality are \u201cthe enemy\u201d. \n\nFast forward to election 2016. I witnessed all the smugness, all the self righteousness, the idea that we alone contain the progress of humanity on our back blow up in our faces. All whites people are racist? Deplorables? I witnessed people blame all white people for voting for Trump when the blame laid at the feet of Hillary Clinton and her teams hubris. Not stepping into Wisconsin until it was too late, not caring about core Democratic states because they were mostly rural and therefore not important, only caring about coastal elites. Then I witnessed people laughing and not showing empathy to coal workers with black lung because of the simple \u201ccrime\u201d of voting for Trump. Then and there I realized the things I believed in, the things I fight for were all a lie. We weren\u2019t truly \u201cbetter\u201d.\n\nI want to apologize on the behalf of any liberal or leftist who has judged you, who has hurt you, called you names or dehumanized you. As the months roll by I see myself questioning so much of what I was taught. I\u2019m now a Christian, pro-life, and celibate. I will be confirmed as a Catholic this Easter. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m writing all of this. As much as I\u2019m disillusioned with the current left I don\u2019t find the current right a real alternative either. Yet more and more I start to see the value in good, hard conservative values. I\u2019d like to say I need some help but I\u2019m not sure with what exactly. I want to know how we can do better. How we can further understand each other and love one another.\n\nSorry this was long.\n\n**TLDR** disillusioned with current left and especially SJWs. Finding more and more value in conservatism but still also find worthwhile things in the left too. Dumbfounded as to what to do and needs guidance.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m here, but I\u2019m really struggling with my leftist politics and really need to talk to some conservatives about how I\u2019m feeling"}

This is something that's been on my mind for a while, and has really begun to bother me. I'm eighteen and it seems like all my peers are made from the same 2018 cookie-cutter. Liberal, pro-choice, sex-positive, anti-gun, atheists who think things like modesty and gender roles are evil. I, on the other hand, am the exact opposite of almost all of that. The scary thing is I know very, very few people my age who think the same. My own best friend thinks I'm brainwashed and doing what my parents tell me to do when in reality, I may be even more Conservative than them because I'm more passionate about it, and I'm more modest than my mom!\n\n\nThere are some things happening that it seems like I'm in 1% of with my opinion. For example, as a woman, I 110% agree with Nikki Haley's words on the sidebar. I'm apparently the only female in my life who believes these women's marches are absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary, and putting your toddler daughter in a p*ssy hat is absolutely vile. We're talking dozens of my classmates and family members and acquaintances rallying for something that I find truly appalling. Same scenario with pro-life or basically any topic that there's a Conservative side to. \n\n\nIt's a very strange and lonely feeling. I'm not trying to find a radical Conservative corner because extremists in anything are a little much. But I don't think I know anyone younger than 30 who shares any of my beliefs.

{"author":"yamsHS","created_utc":1518563578,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"Part of what I do for news about everyday is browse for news in politics. Because there really isn't an unpartisan source for news on this site (r/politics claims to be neutral, which anybody that has seen that sub enough times can clearly see is not the case), the best thing I can do is browse articles from subs with both sides of the political spectrum (so r/politics and this sub). Today I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7x8fyb/terror_victims_donald_trump_wont_talk_about/?utm_source=reddit-android) titles \"Terror victims Donald Trump won't talk about\". The article is from *Salon* so it's obviously biased as hell so keep that in mind if you decide to read it, but the article isn't really the main reason why I'm posting this. \n\nA bit of background from me; I don't like the typical \"alt-right\" groups, in fact I despise them. They are usually racists, provocateurs and violence usually follows the group wherever it goes (look at Charlottesville). Then they get labeled and are associated  as \"mainstream right-wing politics\". This is why we are all usually labeled as \"racist\" or as \"bigots\" by just expressing conservative opinions. These groups are *extreme* groups that I think any level headed person realizes that exact fact and oppose what they stand for. With \"extreme groups\" in mind, I came across this comment:\n\n&gt;I love how certain rioters are called \u201cantifa\u201d. The abbreviation is stupid and silly. These are people *opposing fascism*. They should simply be called *anti-fascists* because the people they are opposing are, gasp, fascists.\n\nThe consensus that ensued below honestly shocked me. These are the same people that condemned the extreme action of the alt-right. Yet most people thought the organization that got labeled as a freaking *domestic terror group* was not only acceptable but actually *good*. This actually blows my mind. Steven Crowder literally showed a video where his partner went undercover and **they were handing out knives and ice picks with the intention of stabbing people.** How can anybody be OK with this from anybody? I honestly wanna know why people on the left straight up ignore antifa's actions or downplay thier presence or even both. I have a feeling that a part of this is people being uninformed about what antifa actually is, but part of me thinks that with some of these people there is deeper psychological reasoning for thier ignorance.\n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for listening to my rant and have a nice rest of your day!","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Why are people on the left so accepting of the extreme left wing \"antifa\" group while at the same time denounce the extreme right \"alt-right\" group?"}

Chesterton, was an English writer, poet, philosopher, dramatist, journalist, orator, lay theologian, biographer, and literary and art critic. Chesterton is often referred to as the \"prince of paradox\". Time magazine has observed of his writing style: \"Whenever possible Chesterton made his points with popular sayings, proverbs, allegories\u2014first carefully turning them inside out.\"\n\n&gt;Chesterton is well known for his fictional priest-detective Father Brown, and for his reasoned apologetics. Even some of those who disagree with him have recognised the wide appeal of such works as Orthodoxy and The Everlasting Man. Chesterton routinely referred to himself as an \"orthodox\" Christian, and came to identify this position more and more with Catholicism, eventually converting to Catholicism from High Church Anglicanism. George Bernard Shaw, his \"friendly enemy\", said of him, \"He was a man of colossal genius.\" Biographers have identified him as a successor to such Victorian authors as Matthew Arnold, Thomas Carlyle, Cardinal John Henry Newman, and John Ruskin.\n\n[Those lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton) sum him up, but the main reason that I like him is because he's a Catholic and has some sayings that really line up with conservative ideals. He also says things that are clearly applicable to today (especially the sidebar quote that /u/thatrightwinger found for me).\n\nHe has a bunch of great books and he's well worth listening to.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"This Week's Sidebar Tribute: G.

It explains envy in all its political forms and dispels many of the Utopian egalitarian notions so prevalent in today's left.I have to say this is one of the most illuminating book you can read if you wish to know the bare foundation of the Social Justice movement.\n\nIt is hard to do this book justice with my own words so instead i'll post some excerpts that truly floored me:\n\n\"Demagogues appeal to envy because its universality makes potential victims of all the people and because the invincible inequality of our own personal capabilities and of the irremediable limitation of many social goods makes it inevitable that the majority will feel inferior to certain minorities. The promotion of this envious feeling of inferiority is the dominant political tactic, at least in the present age. The demagogic promotion of envy, as with everything else that refers to this unpublishable feeling, is not carried out in public but under cover. A contemporary disguise of collective envy is what is called \"social justice.\" How does this ideological and derivative argumentation run? A fundamental postulate is established that the more just a society is, the more equal its members are in opportunities, position, and wealth; and immediately it is established that the party will fight without rest to achieve such \"justice\". The appeal of this axiom and of such a program is evidently unbeatable for the envious, since it promises to abolish the unassimilated inferiority that causes them so much pain. Equality is a paradisiacal promise for the envious, the definite incentive\"(93)\n\n\"The teaching profession constitutes a special case. The parties inspired by Marxism have adopted the tactic of coming to power not through the massive support of the proletariat, but through the cooperation of so-called intellectuals. It makes little difference that such a tactic contradicts the postulates of historical materialism. Its practical application runs through the controls shaping public opinion, educational institutions, and the means of mass communication. The university is the main center of this activity since it is the \"alma mater\" of the whole educative process, and the parties try to make it a branch of the state and fill its positions not on the basis of scholarship and knowledge but party affiliation. When these parties feel insecure with respect to their hold on power, they oversature the positions to with appointments that make departments top-heavy and deny promotions to future generations.In this way, the disciplines become politicized and lose intellectual dignity. Those who rebel against ideological subservience, ordinarily the best, are ostracized or eliminated, and the transmission of culture is left in the hands of the commentators on the party catechism. Objective science thus becomes egalitarian. This is one of the most serious outcomes of the hierarchical function of the state: injustice to the teachers, the students, and the truth. This is the road to the diabolical utopia Orwell described\"(107).\n\nAmazon Link here","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Egalitarian Envy: The Origins of Social Justice"}

We see too many false arguments that are easily refuted, and that's why we tend to lose the gun debate quite a bit.\n\n---\n\nThe 2nd Amendment was created as a check against government tyranny. It was not created so that we could hunt with firearms. It was not created so that we may shoot for sport. It was not even technically created as a means to protect property against other American citizens who wish to intrude on your own property. All of those things are benefits of this one, solid fact: The right to bear arms is for the sole purpose of protecting the public from a potentially tyrannical government.\n\nThis is the law. This cannot be changed. Any attempt from a government to infringe upon this law should be seen as invalid. That government has immediately lost its identity as the government and now has to be overthrown and re-established correctly, most likely through a convention of states.\n\nSo, about semi or fully automatic rifles:\n\nDoes the government own and operate semi-automatic rifles? Yes? Then the people must also own and operate semi-automatic rifles, because the people as a collective must be MORE power than their government.\n\nDoes the government own and operate fully automatic rifles? Yes? Then the people must also own and operate fully automatic rifles, because the people as a collective must be MORE power than their government.\n\nKeep going with this point the higher they go. Tanks? Yes. Missiles? Yes. Nukes? Yes.\n\nNOW WOAH WOAH WOAH YOU'RE ADVOCATING FOR THE PEOPLE'S OWNERSHIP OF NUKES?\n\nI'm not advocating for anything. I am telling you what is THE LAW. I cannot change it. You cannot change it. No one can change it, and any attempt to change it should be seen as an elementary violation of the constitution, and completely invalidate whatever authority was held. This is THE LAW, and no matter what I think about it, what you think about it, what the media thinks about it, what the government thinks about it, what your facebook friends think about it, etc... IT CANNOT BE INFRINGED UPON.\n\nTO REITERATE: ANY ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THIS LAW SHOULD BE SEEN AS AN IMMEDIATE INVALIDATION OF THE GOVERNMENT'S AUTHORITY\n\n---\n\nThis is how you argue. I don't care about how insane it sounds. It's the law. I see too much of \"AR-15s should be legal because I use them to hunt\" NO. STOP IT. \"Bump stocks should be legal because I need them to defend my home from thieves\" NO. You may be right, but THIS IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THE 2ND AMENDMENT. \"I need a silencer so that I can defend my local business\" THAT IS NOT WHY YOU NEED A SILENCER. YOU NEED A SILENCER BECAUSE YOUR GOVERNMENT USES SILENCERS.\n\ntldr: A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"A Debate Tip: How to Argue the Case for Semi-Automatic and even Fully Automatic Rifles."}

But 99% of those protesting were not affected. They are operating on either paranoia or the euphoric feeling of being swept up in an important movement. \n\nI have no idea what the game is. Why are the organizers of the protests doing this? It's all so misinformed. I edited a video of a young lady screaming \"ban AR-15s!\". She has no idea that she is asking for a ban on how a gun looks! And people are constantly asking for a ban on assault rifles. They speak with the same misinformed bias. \nSome absolutely ignorant lady destroyed her pistol to say she is more concerned about the lives of children than her gun. I've have never seen something so ironic. It was just a hand gun!\nIn the White House a disgusting man that has no connection to shootings was obviously fake crying saying \"why is this happening?\" The the man that had a daughter killed a week ago stood like a man and said what he believed. \n\nMy message is for you to not be moved by these ignoramouses, paranoid fruitcakes, and manufactured tears. Your 2nd Amendment Rights are as needed as ever. Fight for them. Though we need to be open to certain reforms, I believe the most necessary reform is education replacing paranoia. Try to be kind to those who oppose your rights. They are misinformed, but I think there are always valid points the opposition makes....as long as they aren't lying. \n\nTL;DR\nI needed to vent about all the misinformation going around about guns that if being forced into my eye holes. Lots of protestors are lying and fake crying and asking bans for things that don't make sense.

Everyone just assumes I support Planned Parenthood, Women's March, and any other organization or decision that supposedly supports women. Every other person who attends one of these events preaches about how they're defending the rights of their fellow women. It's now a universal belief that girls should be raised to be loud and assertive, to stand up to boys and to ditch traditional feminine ideals. I *hate* it. I'm not saying there's one way to raise a boy and one way to raise a girl. But to straight up tell little girls that being aggressive is how you stick it to the patriarchy? Not exactly my style. Submission isn't the way to go either but foregoing respect to make a point shouldn't be as common as it is. And the whole disaster of combining the Boy and Girl Scouts is another perfect example of this. Rather than expanding the Girl Scouts to include the same activities available in Boy Scouts, they had to shove them together. And I'm telling you, part of that is because a lot of young girls are being taught that the things they do in Girl Scouts and would learn at home are sexist. I can't tell you how many people I saw/heard say sewing, cooking, crafts, etc were dumb and they want their daughter to be able to do the Boy Scout things instead. Which there's nothing really wrong with that *except* the part where you crap all over traditional femininity. The whole \"modesty is evil and young girls should be encouraged to dress however they please\" thing is another branch of it. I suppose in the end we should all try to raise kind adults who can think for themselves so they don't end up believing this.\n\n\nKids should be left out of protests and rallies. Period. Doesn't matter what it's for or against, using a child to make a statement is wrong. And yes, *using* the child is exactly what they're doing. What other reason is there to put a baby in a \"nasty\" shirt and p-ssy hat? They do it because it's poignant. I've seen people outright say that. Some seem to have this idealized outlook on all the marches and protests and rallies. Like they're *fighting* for rights same as generations before when in fact it's not even close to being the same thing. Fighting for your \"right\" to abort your unborn child VS fighting for the right to vote...one of these is not like the other. At all. It's so far removed from being \"feminism\" that it's disgraceful for Women's March and modern feminists to be in the same sect as Women's Suffrage. \n\n\nLastly, I wish people would stop forcing the idea that women are *physically* equal to men. How many cases have there been where the requirements for firefighters, police officers, or soldiers were reduced so a female could make the cut? I'm not saying there are no women capable of filling these jobs, but basic biology explains why so many can't. I mean, I'm 5'2 and 130 pounds. There are a lot more women that match me in size than men. There's pretty much nothing I can do to reach the requirements to be a firefighter. There's a reason those requirements are in place, folks.\n\n\nWomen have been treated like dirt throughout history. We're not anymore. That time is over and done. There's nothing left to fight for us to fight for in first world countries.\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I feel like femininity is under attack by...modern feminists."}

As of my family, my father is an independent (never sticking with one of the two major parties) while my mother was a passionate Democratic. As of me, I was never political back home, but identified as a Democratic and shared most Democratic ideologies. I cannot emphasis enough how I was never a politician; in political debates among peers, I would never say anything, but instead, just listen to both sides and never jumped in, not knowing enough about either side to take a stance.\n\nFor college, I decided to attend RUN for financial reasons, going out of state and exposing myself to an environment I was unfamiliar with. It\u2019s been one semester and I can confidently state that I am now a conservative Republican and this all changed after attending RUN. \n\nI almost feel guilty for feeling this way as I am one of very few who share this ideology on this campus. However, for the first time in my entire life, I was surrounded by politics and became exposed to an extremely liberal environment where almost every conversation with my classmates and peers turned political when it came to issues that threatened African Americans, Hispanics, illegal immigrants, etc. Trying to avoid conforming to the environment around me, I was prompted to research extensively about the topics that came up frequently and this has made me to take the side of the Republicans. \n\nTo be completely honest, I expected to become more liberal and leftist when attending this school, just as the agenda of the university tries to enforce on its students. But, the opposite has happened and I guess, I\u2019m trying to figure out why being surrounded in this environment has made me to find comfort and reason in the exact opposite side. \n\nCan anyone else share their experience and/or their reasoning behind why this happened?\n\n(*I'm sorry for formatting issues, this is my first post*)","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Going to a Liberal University Made Me Conservative"}

I make 60k a year and am set up to retire at 46 years old and have always thought that my pay/pension along with my co-workers were unsustainable for the economic environment of NYS. Let me start off by saying that it has bothered me for awhile that I cannot name 5 associates that are not government employees or are receiving their work through subsidies/contracts of the government. The vast majority of income by the individual citizens of New York State are through government funds and those private businesses are propped up by government employees purchasing goods and services at these businesses. So your grocery stores and car dealerships are set up to provide goods for your public employees who receive their money through the state government. Your child are facilities take care of the kids of government employees and your real estate agents sell houses to government employees. In this sense the money is just circulating around and no real wealth creation is taking place. The machinists I know fabricates stuff for the county buildings, the electricians are contracted through SUNY systems to work on campuses, the plumbers work in the grade schools, the nurses exist to take care of medicaid patients and government employees with government insurance etc. The entire economy of the state of New York is funneled through state and government programs which in turn funds small and local businesses. Without government employees small businesses in NYS would cease to exist. Medicaid, which a ton of New Yorkers are on, props up the hospital systems and the cycle continues there. I would say the few steel plants and other shops that are left contribute to the tax base however the business climate is so abysmal they are gifted tax cuts at the state level to encourage them not to leave. \n\nEssentially I do not know how my state sustains itself and I feel that it is a house of cards waiting to collapse. I could get into the public employees unions of NYS and how the dues are just funds for the DNC but I will spare that unless someone is interested. The state of New York is being run like a Ponzi Scheme \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_New_York_(state)#/media/File:Tree_Map_of_Industries_by_Share_in_New_York_(2014).png\n\n\nThis map shows the economy of NYS and the industries it encompasses. As you see schooling, justice systems are the main industries along with construction which is subsidized by those industries. Like I said grocery stores exist for the government employee to shop at and the list goes on. \nhttps://datausa.io/profile/geo/new-york/#tmap_ind_num_emp","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"New York State is a Ponzi Scheme"}
