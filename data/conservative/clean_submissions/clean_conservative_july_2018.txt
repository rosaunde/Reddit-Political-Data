Both NY and MA are suggesting this \"solution.\" How in the world is this legal? If taxpayers are funding the unions and unions are funneling money to DNC candidates exclusively then how is that not a state funded party? I know if I ask a Democrats they will try to claim the money unions use to fund politicians is separated from that the taxpayers are being forced to give but money is fungible. Every dollar given to a union from the taxpayer to pay for the electricity during collective bargaining sessions saves them a dollar of membership dues they can then use to bribe the DNC for more taxes. \n\nI just don't see how in the world such a scheme can be legal. \n\n\n\n\n***\n\n[Union workers would get city income tax credit to pay for dues under pol's proposal](http:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/news\/politics\/ny-pol-janus-union-dues-tax-credit-20180627-story.html)\n\n\nAfter the Supreme Court dealt a major blow to public sector unions, a city pol is proposing a credit on local income taxes to pay for members\u2019 dues.\n\nCity Councilman Justin Brannan will introduce a resolution Thursday calling for a dollar for dollar credit on city income taxes that would equal the cost of dues.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in the case Janus vs. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees that government workers who opt out of joining unions not be forced to pay fees to the union to cover the cost of collective bargaining.\n\nBrannan (D-Brooklyn) said the tax credit would be a way to encourage workers to join unions anyway.\n\n\u201cThe path to the middle class runs straight through a union hall and anyone who says different is lying through their teeth. This decision is a direct attack on working men and women and the middle class,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to make it easier not harder for people to join and support labor unions. And we can do that with an income tax credit.\u201d\n\nThe proposal would likely make a hefty dent in city tax coffers, but no study has been done yet to determine how much it would cost.\n\nIt\u2019s being introduced as a non-binding resolution in the City Council because state legislation is required before the city can change its tax system.\n\nThe state already passed legislation to allow union workers to deduct dues from their state income taxes. A credit, unlike a deduction, can be taken by people who don\u2019t itemize their taxes.\n\nThe high court\u2019s decision was met with wide condemnation by officials in New York.\n\nMayor de Blasio and 22 other mayors signed a pledge to pursue policies to shore up public sector unions after the ruling, including by giving new employees a message from the mayor talking up the contributions of unions, giving unions information on new hires, and allowing union reps to meet with would-be members on work time.\n\n\u201cIn New York City, we believe in fairness \u2014 we believe working people deserve fairness. It\u2019s clear that the conservative Supreme Court justices don\u2019t share that same sentiment,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to stand with mayors from across the country who once again recognize the power of cities to do right where others have done wrong.\u201d\n\n***\n\n[Legislators weighing bill to \u2018soften\u2019 impact of Supreme Court ruling on unions](http:\/\/archive.is\/Wj7fU#selection-733.0-733.78)\n\nBy Matt Stout and Jamie Halper Globe Correspondents  June 27, 2018\n\nMassachusetts House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo said Wednesday that lawmakers intend to pursue legislation in the coming weeks to \u201csoften the blow\u201d on unions after the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to require government employees to pay union fees.\n\nDeLeo said that the details of any potential legislation are far from settled and that lawmakers plan to speak with union leaders to find a \u201cconsensus that we can support.\u201d\n\nBut he indicated the Legislature intends to move fast. He said he hopes to move a bill to the House floor before the legislative session wraps at the end of July. The top leader in the Senate, President Harriette L. Chandler, also hopes to craft a bill by then, according to an aide.\n\n\u201cWe as a House will be taking some action . . . to soften the blow, shall we say, relative to our unions here in Massachusetts,\u201d DeLeo told reporters after a Democratic caucus at the State House. The Winthrop Democrat said the 5-4 ruling in Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which overturned a 40-year-old precedent, \u201ccould be quite a bit of loss in terms of revenue for our unions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we just want to make sure that unions still have a place here in Massachusetts and they play a role again in the Massachusetts economy,\u201d he said. \u201cAny issues that come up that could limit the role that they play could be detrimental to our economy. That\u2019s what we want to take a look at.\u201d\n***\n\nUnions already get tax dollars which is baffling to me. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.dailysignal.com\/2016\/09\/28\/the-sneaky-way-public-unions-are-getting-tax-dollars-for-union-activities\/\n\nFortunately, 47 of 50 states\u2019 constitutions contain a provision known as the \u201cgift clause\u201d that bans government subsidies primarily benefitting private entities.\n\nIn other words, the gift clause prohibits states and municipalities from giving away the public\u2019s money unless it primarily serves a public purpose or the government receives adequate consideration. Since union release time serves the private interests of unions and fails to provide any value to the public, the gift clause can be used to eliminate the subsidy.\n\nIn some states, public policy organizations are attempting to do just that. Most recently, on Sept. 7 the Goldwater Institute and Texas Public Policy Foundation filed a lawsuit against the city of Austin and the Austin Firefighters Association Local 975. They are challenging that the collective bargaining agreement between the city and union, which grants release time, violates Texas\u2019 gift clause.\n\nThe release time that the International Association of Firefighters receives is not a trivial amount. According to public record requests submitted by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, in Austin, the city\u2019s police department, fire department, and emergency medical services were granted 10,857 hours of release time in fiscal year 2012 and 16,963 in fiscal year 2013, a cumulative total of 27,821.14.\n\nFor the salaries made available, the cost of union release time to Austin taxpayers was $227,530 and $593,783 in fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2013, respectively. These costs do not include pension benefits.\n\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Democrat politicians are reacting to the SCOTUS Janus ruling by proposing giving tax dollars directly to unions so unions can pass those funds to the DNC candidates.

And yes, they\u2019re going to impact the Democratic Party. \u2026\u201d\n\nTranslation: Our party's stance has become nuanced in socialist policies, that we don't care if we're subverted into becoming far-left, because we get more votes. The Democratic Party is the new socialist.

{"author":"psy_raven","created_utc":1530483852,"num_comments":5,"score":0,"selftext":"The greatest lie ever told to women, which women swallowed hook, line and sinker, was that working 60 hours a week towards a career and being financially independent is somehow more noble and worthwhile than having children and devoting their life to raising them.\n\n\nLet us step back and consider what is the #1 most important factor in the continued survival of the human race.  What is absolutely crucial to our continuing evolution towards becoming intellectually superior beings?  Reproduction.  Yes, reproduction and the need to reproduce is pretty much the primary driver behind a majority of human behavior and, well at least up until recently, was the reason gender roles and social constructs existed.  Nature ensured the continual evolution of human to produce smarter and stronger offsprings by making certain traits, like intelligence and physical strength, and other physical features be more attractive than say, laziness or stupidity.  The system worked.  For hundred of thousands of years, humans evolved, getting stronger, taller, and smarter.  Smart women realized what kind of man would be most suited to take care of their offspring and provide for the family, so those men got to have more kids.  In return, these women were able to have more resources and raise their kids with less difficulty than women who poorly chose their mates. \n\n\nLet's jump to the present.  More and more women are choosing their career and independence over having a family.  So, ask yourselves, who are the majority of these women who are choosing such a path.  Is it a woman with a 80 IQ?  Or is it more likely a woman with a 120 IQ who's pursuing a career in medicine, law, or science?  I would postulate that it is the latter.  What are the consequences of having the smartest women stop reproducing?  \n\n\nWell, if we believe the recent hype that a majority of the intelligence is inherited from the maternal family line, then we are in serious trouble.  (I don't believe this.  I believe that intelligence is a combined trait inherited from both parents. https:\/\/www.snopes.com\/fact-check\/intelligence-is-inherited-only-from-your-mother\/  But even so, the point I'm trying to make is still valid)  This would mean that the people who the world needs the MOST to reproduce, i.e. highly intelligent people, are reproducing the least.  In effect, we are reducing the overall intelligence of the world. https:\/\/www.pri.org\/stories\/2013-05-25\/western-iqs-drop-14-points-last-century-study-says\n\n\nWhy?  Why did they convince women to ignore the bigger picture of human survival and our evolution towards superior humanity and instead, force feed this nonsense that raising a family is stupid and having a baby is a burden?  \n\n\nIt is because a dumb population is much easier to control and manipulate than a smart population.  Those in control, those who have wealth that is hidden from us that reach levels we can not even fathom, would like a population that will never rise up against them.  It is much easier to convince a group of lesser intelligent population by telling them, \"hey, these guys are evil.  These guys are ripping you off.  These guys are the enemy.  Go kill them\" than to actually convince free thinkers and those who can't be brainwashed.  This is why feminism has been pushed so hard against us ever since the end of WW2.  Because the end of that war was the time that our current overlords consolidated their power and still rule over us to this day, even though most people aren't even aware of their existence.\n\n\nDo you need further proof?  Consider abortion.  Do you ever notice that the left's argument is ALWAYS about the rights of the woman?  Rarely do the left debate on the father's rights (after all, you don't get pregnant alone and certainly, the father is held financially responsible for any burdens should the woman choose to have the child) or that a fetus is at least, partial human or at the very least, it has the full potential to BECOME a human, and thus, should AT LEAST, have partial rights.   Why is that?  \n\nIt is because abortion is another weapon used to convince the woman that having children and raising a family is a \"bad thing\".  Now, I'm not saying abortion is bad or not bad.  Nor am I saying it should be legal\/illegal.  I'm merely saying that abortion, among other weapons like sexual harassment, are used to convince women that \"Hey, having children is bad.  Relying on your husband is bad.  Just work, make money, then die alone\".... \n\n\n\nI am truly saddened by the antagonistic relationship that is the default for couples these days.  I'm truly saddened by the divorce rates that keep climbing, the MGTOW movement that is the result of the sadistic intent behind the feminist movement, and the common place hatred and anger from women towards men.  But most of all, I feel saddened by these women who are now in their 50's and 60's regretting their decisions not to have a family and a husband.  They are the victims of the plan that has been in place since 1945.  \n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The real reason feminism has been pushed on us for the last century. Make us dumber."}

{"author":"Esoteric_Innovations","created_utc":1531000670,"num_comments":27,"score":54,"selftext":"Growing up in a rural town in the South, my family has been a part of the working poor for generations. Working jobs like Mail Clerks, Laundry Mat workers, Construction, and lower level Military duties. At times, as I was growing up, we went to a local food bank to make sure we could survive the next month. In many ways, this kind of life growing up gave me a desire to change things, and by the time I was in a Freshman in High School, I was a Communist. \n\nAs you may, or may not, expect, a few close friends of mine were also in the same vein that I was. We were the circle of guys that were always into Science and Mathematics, although my specialty was Philosophy. In those early years of High School we were all Communists, more or less, and were open in expressing it to the people who'd listen. I remember that I'd speak to my U.S. Government teacher after classes sometimes and we'd talk about politics a fair bit, and on one or two occasions we shared a mutual admiration for Lenin and Trotsky. Which only made my belief in the ideology stronger.\n\nSince I was a kid, I've told people that the most important thing to me in life is learning, and this was no different when I was in High School. I'd spend hours in the school library whenever I could, reading countless books on various subjects. I used a lot of this time to do a lot of research on economics, politics, history, and human nature because I wanted to build strong arguments to show people why Communism was the better alternative to Capitalism and the like. So things went like this for about three years.\n\nAs time went on in those first three years, I kept reading and researching relentlessly. Inevitably, I began to realize that everything about Communism just wasn't going to work. No matter how one tried to go about implementing it. The economics just wouldn't work due to problems of getting appropriate information about the wants and needs of people without the existence of a currency and prices, among other reasons. The political advocacy of a more pure democracy is something that people have criticized for thousands of years because it would play off of humanity's factionalist and indulgent tendencies. So on, and so forth. \n\nInitially, as I kept hitting roadblock after roadblock and began realize there was no possibility Socialism in general would ever work, I was depressed for a little while because I just desperately wanted it to work. That's when I adopted the idea of the Nordic Model that we always hear about, but still dragged my feet about it because I wasn't happy about it. I kept searching for a way out, usually through some variation of Anarchism. \n\nIt was through my studies in Anarchism that I stumbled upon Anarcho-Capitalism. While I vehemently oppose the ideology as just as flawed as all other Anarchist ideologies, reading about it introduced me to the Austrian School of Economics. Reading the works of Carl Menger, Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk, and especially Ludwig von Mises changed everything for me. I'd already given up on Socialism, but reading the Austrian's work made me fully embrace Capitalism. Their work made so much sense and I was taken aback by the fact I'd never heard of it before since all of its points about economics were closer to the truth than any other school of Economics I'd seen. The works of the Austrians, as well as that of Dr. Thomas Sowell, convinced me that Laissez-faire Capitalism was the only way forward to a better and more peaceful world for everyone. And I've since become a fierce defender of Laissez-faire and the Menger-Bawerk-Mises tradition of the Austrian School of Economics.\n\nAbout two years ago, my old friends from High School and I met up just to talk. I'd expected them all to still be communists, but they weren't. They'd drifted away from it as they also realized it wasn't going to work, and we talked for a while reflecting on it and the like. They'd given up on it as well, and I was glad to see that.\n\nSince then, we're all Capitalists and pretty happy about it. I've personally grown increasingly conservative over the past few years as a result of learning about those like William F. Buckley Jr. and Barry Goldwater, along with Dr. Sowell again. Though I'd best be described as a Moderate with strong conservative and liberal policies on different issues (e.g. Strong support of Gun Rights like Switzerland as well as Strong support of Drug legalization like Portugal.)\n\nI wanted to go over all of this because I wanted to tell a story about how I became a Socialist, as well as my friends, and how we all came to realize over time, as we learned more and more, that it just wasn't going to work. \n\nIn the past year, I've often said this to people that are unfamiliar with economics or political theory:\n\n*\"The more and more I've learned about economics and politics, the more and more Capitalist and Conservative I've become.\"* ","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Going from Communist to Laissez-faire Capitalist."}

{"author":"TrashRider","created_utc":1531164788,"num_comments":2,"score":0,"selftext":"Well as a brief overview of the current US political scene would show, there is a  great difference between the right and left sides of the political spectrum. But to cut the bullshit and the reason you are reading this (hopefully) is to either have confirmation of the way leftists operate their political agenda or your are a leftist yourself and want to hear what a \u201cracist\u201d, \u201cbigoted\u201d, mouth breather would say. To get to the point, the way leftist media and supporters of the left would argue is that anyone who isn\u2019t a hardcore pro-choice civil rights activist is the second coming of Hitler. But to say that ICE and the Trump administration are Nazis would be extremely hypocritical and ignorant of what your side of the political spectrum is doing. Let\u2019s start from the most prominent act of Nazism that the left uses; propaganda machines. These \u201cmedia outlets\u201d push their political goals and agenda down viewers throat and are essentially propaganda outlets for people who don\u2019t know better. Much like Nazis they have promises of a better America for the minorities and leftists who have lost individuality and have confirmed to a solely group ideology. They make claims that if the left gets control of the US it will be a safe haven for everyone that sides with their viewpoints. This is similar to the Nazi promises of a unified German state  by promoting the few that actually agree with the ideology. Another way is through the use of loaded language and lies to create a feeling of outrage and anger. I won\u2019t mention any specifics due to the crazy nature of these types of platforms but everyone knows those \u201crelatable\u201d anti-Trump websites that use fake data to sway the gullible and young American people. Examples include the use of School Shootings to promote gin control instead of respecting the people involved in a tragedy or completely legal and peaceful pro-Trump rallies and showing them as groups of hate. The way this relates to the rise of Nazism in Germany is because they both use propaganda that pictures the parties as victims and as people who are serving justice to others while really just trying to push a political agenda. And for the crux of the argument that the left is using Nazism ideals to try and sway the masses is the way the try and vilify the Trump Admin. and white people, most notably white men. This is what the left used to convert the right wing of America. They use downright racist tactics and embellish stories to try to make these groups seem like the evil ones. This can be seen a while ago when the talks of separation of children from immigrants was used as a weapon against the Trump Administration. On the other hand the left uses white Americans as a scapegoat for everyone else\u2019s problems. Let me give an example a minority woman goes to an interview. She doesn\u2019t get the job. Instead of thinking of ways to improve and get a job, she vilifies the white majority and government and claims that it\u2019s their fault for being white and racist. It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out but this targeting of these groups of people is exactly like Nazis blaming their problems on Jews even though they did nothing wrong. And the fact that it\u2019s a social norm and acceptable to do this is just disgusting and hypocritical to the extreme. Now I will admit this is biased. As a conservative and right winger I will try to make the opposing side seem awful but if your truly want to see the truth do research and see the logic and parallels for yourself. Then make your decision. But based on that the hypocrisy in the left is absurd and should be more denounced by true Americans. As a send off. as to not get this post removed unfairly, I will say that I am not calling anyone or any party a Nazi. I am just showing the parallels between the two.

Although the stakes of the 2016 election were understood it seems that, in democrats\u2019 minds, the threat to progressivism justifies almost anything to overcome Trump. Dictated by the latest emotionalism and hate of all things Trump, the left\u2019s base of beliefs has firmly moved to Socialism. This is concerning in itself for conservatives, who see America adopting socialism as very un - American. Why liberal love of Socialism is now clear, with the Supreme Court nomination, the means by which the left wishes to drastically change our country is also coming to light. \n\nRecent articles in The Washington Post and USA Today advocate for \u201cCourt Packing\u201d. This means injecting up to 6 more court justices into the Supreme Court and perhaps even more. The idea is that as soon as the democrats get power they will carry out this drastic change that completely changes our country, turning the Court into a nominated legislature. In the face of not being in control and seeing our country not headed toward growing progressive policies, this is the strategy that the Democratic Party has adopted (publicly or not). Packing the court with leftist judges would undoubtedly just be the first step in creating a socialist government. With the court firmly in the grasp of liberals the most basic systems and forms of government can be changed. This is because the left believes the constitution is forever changing. Undoubtedly with the new license to change government, they will use the Supreme Court to create a new America, wether it was built by the rules...or not. \n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The Left Looks to Completely Change the Rules to Win the Game.

However, I have somewhat of a story to share and I thought this would be the place to do it. I am a healthy, adult male - using a throwaway.\n\nFrom a very early age, I felt like a girl. I would dress in female attire whenever I could, look at myself in the mirror and wish with all of my heart that I could change my gender, even tried to have my entire family use female pronouns when referring to me. There was not a doubt in my young mind that I was meant to be female. This all took place until about puberty.\n\nMy parents reacted about how anyone would react in the 90s - assumed that it was a weird childhood phase. They humored me but never actually took it seriously. **Thank goodness.**\n\nUnsurprisingly, puberty had a way of straightening out these deviant thoughts. Soon enough all of these desires were behind me; they all seemed foreign in hindsight. I finished my teens as a healthy, heterosexual male, and I am now a regular adult. I have maintained intimate relationships with women, and have unwavering confidence in both my gender and sexuality. I actually was raised in a very liberal environment, so there was no societal pressure to behave masculinely. I just naturally figured it out on my own.\n\nI share this story because I know that if this would have happened twenty years later (aka in the present), the outcome would have been very different. My parents (now far left activists) would have taken this childhood phase as some sort of a indication of transgenderism. I would have been taken to consultations, and god forbid even injected with hormones to try and reconcile my childhood delusions.\n\nI certainly had my fair share of weird phases and feelings, some more persistent than others. Let me be clear, *I cannot speak for anyone else*. I don't mean to imply that I know what is best for anyone else. What I can say is, kids are dumb. When I was a prepubescent boy, I wanted to be a girl more than anything. I would have jumped on any opportunity to make this a reality, such as the solutions that are mainstreamed today. I have no doubt in my mind that if I grew up today my parents and I would essentially ruin any chance of living a life of a healthy male - which I current live.\n\nI see more and more in the news about protecting the \"trans kids\", and [Canada even has laws](https:\/\/www.dailysignal.com\/2017\/06\/27\/new-law-canada-remove-kids-parents-reject-transgender-ideology\/) to remove the kids from their parents if the parents won't acknowledge their perceived identity. These laws are undoubtedly on the horizon for the US. I pray for all the kids who act like I did as a youth, and hope that they don't come to regret these choices as an adult. These are serious decisions, and when I was that age I certainly wasn't anywhere near ready to speak with authority about my identity.\n\nTL;DR: I convinced myself I was transgender the first decade of my life, and grew out of it. If this happened today, a leftist could ruin any chance of me living as a normal man.\n\nEdit: Grammar\/clarity","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Cautionary perspective from a previous \"transgender child\""}

Along with this, the outright calls for violence have increased tenfold. I cannot go into one single thread without seeing calls for a civil war, promotion of attacks against conservatives, and dehumanization of anyone that disagrees with the hive mind.

Someone asked how everyone seems to generally agree on the price of weed since it's illegal and there's nothing regulating its sale. In the process, redditors accidentally started describing and defending free market economics. The basic idea that the seller wants as high of a price as possible, but *wants to make a sale period*, and the buyer wants as low of a price as possible, *but also wants to make a sale*. If the prices each party want can meet in the middle, a sale is made. If not, it isn't and one side or the other has to rethink the price until they can find something both can agree on.\n\nInteresting how people can seem to so easily grasp this concept when applied to something like weed, but the moment you ask \"well, what if we applied that to prescription medication, or surgery, or a doctor's visit?\" all of a sudden we're told that that free market doesn't work, can't work, and the only way to price things correctly is to have the government involved as much as possible.

Just want to clear up two things\n\n1) it absolutely doesn't make sense to indict a **sitting** president\n\n2) SCOTUS judges don't have the ability to indict POTUS or not indict so why would Trump care\n\n2) is self explanatory, I'll dive into 1) the idea that you shouldn't indict a **sitting** president is a common sense. This is a common opinion among legal professionals and lawmakers [including TDS co-leader Robert Mueller](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/politics\/muellers-team-told-trumps-lawyers-the-special-counsel-cannot-indict-a-sitting-president\/2018\/05\/16\/cf4d5700-5961-11e8-858f-12becb4d6067_story.html). The reasoning is pretty simple, indictments are criminal, criminal activity is investigated by the executive branch, the executive branch is ultimately controlled by a sitting president. It makes as much sense as a sheriff's department investigating the elected sheriff's wrong doing while the sheriff is in charge. \n\nNo where in the sentence a **sitting** president shouldn't be indicted is there an implication that a president can't be indicted. Just that they should be impeached first, which oh yeah we legally have impeachment and congressional investigations for this exact reason. \n\n(I'm not saying Trump should be indicted or impeached. I'm just saying there is a common sense order if a president is to be criminally charged) \n\nAs usual, the left is outraged over something truly irrelevant.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"RE: Kavanaugh believes a sitting president can't be indicted and that's clearly Trumps reason for nomination"}

{"author":"blushdot","created_utc":1531630199,"num_comments":11,"score":142,"selftext":"[I came across a fascinating article which I think illustrates *why* immigration laws must be respected.](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/andyjsemotiuk\/2018\/07\/06\/tensions-rise-as-more-u-s-illegals-cross-border-into-canada\/#5fabb84210d8)\n\nSome illegal immigrants in the United States do not want to be deported and see in the media that Canada is this super awesome place that loves them (thanks to people like Trudeau who all but say they are welcome).\n\nWhat has followed is a rise in illegal immigrants circumventing legal immigration AND the asylum process. Basically, there is this weird law which says that you can't just pass through the United States and claim asylum in Canada, but there is a loophole to where as long as you don't show up at a port of entry and cross the border illegally you can make the claim (or something like that - but they are breaking the law).\n\nCanada wants to renegotiate this (surprise surprise).\n\nBut anyway, what's happening is that:\n\n* Illegal immigrants are almost more numerous than Syrian refugees.\n* It costs 10,000-20,000 dollars to process them.\n* They are eligible to obtain work permits, so they can end up taking a job from a local.\n* Have access to all welfare.\n* There is now an 11 year wait time for a refugee hearing and there is a shortage of immigration lawyers.\n\nPremier Ford refuses to accept migrants from Quebec because housing requests in city shelters has quadrupled and municipal services are strained.\n\nI have also seen reports in other articles that they are sending Canadians down to the United States to warn illegal immigrants that they will be deported (LOL) if they try to come, even though it's clear that won't happen if they cross illegally. It should be noted that MOST illegal immigrants are not Hispanic, but Haitian, and largely going to Quebec, but I think Canada is scared that Mexico and Central America may decide Canada looks enticing and then they will be shit out of luck.\n\nHowever, it is near the end of this article which really honed the point home WHY illegal immigration is so bad:\n\n&gt; In the absence of a mitigating policy, illegal migrants crossing the U.S.-Canada border will increasingly consume resources previously meant to help process overseas immigrants. Canadian citizens who seek to bring their family members into the country will be delayed. Employers who seek to bring over skilled workers will not be able to do so. Investors who want to come to Canada to start businesses and grow the Canadian economy will be pushed aside.\n\nSo real people are hurt by illegal immigration - *especially* families looking to be reunited with their loved ones.\n\nBut you know the funny thing?\n\nI looked at the numbers of detained illegal immigrants detained in both countries for the current fiscal year and then compared them to the population of both countries.\n\nGet ready to be absolutely fucking furious with Canada's hypocrisy towards those in the United States calling for immigration laws to be enforced:\n\n[Canada](https:\/\/www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca\/security-securite\/detent\/qstat-2017-2018-eng.html) -  7,364\n\n[United States](https:\/\/www.cbp.gov\/newsroom\/stats\/sw-border-migration) - 286,290\n\nThere are multiple measures for both country, so it's not a perfect match, but I think you can see which country has the more difficult situation. But let's compare it to population.\n\nCanada - 36.29 million \/ 7364 = 1 illegal immigrant for every 4,928 people\n\nUnited States - 325.7 million \/ 286,290 = 1 illegal immigrant for every 1,137 people\n\nBut let's compare asylum seeker rates to better understand what is happening:\n\n[Canada](http:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2018\/04\/16\/asylum-claims-in-canada-reached-highest-level-in-decades-in-2017\/) - 2017 rate is 50,420 (2x last year) =  1 application for every 719 people\n\nUnited States rate (same link as above) - 142,000 = 1 application for every 1,137 people\n\nThe US has a stricter asylum process, and I'm guessing one reason why we have less applications per legal resident is because we have so many illegal immigrants who know they will be deported compared to the situation in Canada where they believe they won't be.\n\nHowever, Canada seems to be getting scared they may have a situation as difficult to deal with as we do... and its ridiculous. What is the wait we have here? Like 2 years for a court case? And it's 10 in Canada? Good god. No wonder they worry about a wave of illegal immigrants seeking opportunity in their country.\n\nHey Canada... now do you wonder why conservatives in the United States are getting upset over illegal immigration?\n\nThat's probably why some of them are afraid of the United States laying down the law... because liberal policy in their country means they'll be illegal immigrants next target.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Canada is overwhelmed by illegal immigrants, which is ruining immigration for everyone else."}

{"author":"yoshijosh55","created_utc":1531653959,"num_comments":11,"score":17,"selftext":"Just before i post this I want to make 2 things clear:\n\n1. I am British, living in a rural area between Birmingham and London called the Midlands that is very right wing\n\n2. I have noticed a lot of Anti-British sentiment not necessarily on this sub, but on a lot of conservative pages, comments etcetera that seems to think of our nation as a liberal a d facist hell hole, so I want to talk about what the UK is actually like from the point of view of an insider\n\nSo, with that out of the way, here is what is going on at the moment.\n\n- The political climate -\n\nFirstly, though many Americans I have spoken to didn't realize it, yes our government is a Conservative coalition between two conservative parties. HOWEVER, the Conservative party leader is Theresa May (obviously) and she is much less right leaning, and is generally trying to please everybody, which of course means she's pleased nobody, least of all her own party which is currently undergoing rebellion from Pro Brexit conservative MPs who actually are more right leaning and often more conservative, and some less authoritarian as well, due to her handling of Brexit. \n\nNow, the current government is about as popular as a rat in a kitchen, as Theresa May is doing nothing to actually fix our nations problems, like our aforementioned Brexit issues and our Nation Health Service, which contrary to what many people in our own country think, does NOT need more government funding, but needs to be made more efficient with it's funding, and crucially, needs to be ran like a business not a welfare (however this is not a debate about government healthcare so I'll leave it at that).\n\nSo with her being so utterly useless, why did the largest portion of our country vote for her? Well, that's because there is no alternative. The main opposition is one Jeremy Corbyn, an actual Marxist (though his policies are a more left leaning Bernie Sanders) who supports the IRA, Hamas and Hezbollah without a trace of irony as a self proclaimed pacifist. So obviously he is a terrible alternative for people who are conservative. So what right wing alternatives are there?\n\n- UKIP who got 20% of the popular vote in 2015 but only 2 seats in government because first past the post (which isn't a bad system as you are electing a local representative but leaves many parties with very few seats). They stand for strong borders, leaving the EU, and are more conservative than the conservatives\n\n- The BNP who got 3000 total votes and are known as being the racist party (I'll let you decide for yourself)\n\n- Nobody else\n\nSo that is why we elected a piss poor government, and at the moment we're just hoping Theresa caves in the the rebels and some actual right wing people get into power like we voted for (this is of course the party of Churchill and Thatcher)\n\n- Sadiq Khan's London -\n\nI see a lot of people here talking about Sadiq Khan, and I just felt like mentioning that he is elected separate of the governments intervention and with London being very liberal,  he was elected to reflect that. And of course, London is very different to the rest of England and the UK. Most outsiders and many Londoners though do feel his removal of stop and searches and banning of knives is \"a little bit silly\" or as I would put it \"utterly ridiculous\". \n\nLondon being liberal is also why they marched against Trump whereas the rest of the country doesn't really care about him much, or likes him.\n\n- That Brexit thing -\n\nI'm sure you all know why the 52% of the population voted Brexit, unaccountable people from Brussels dictating our laws and deciding our regulations of which there are a lot (I shall never forgive the EU for ruining Ritz crackers) and basically having two big governments rather than one, not having direct control of who can live and work in the UK and not being able to make trade deals with the rest of the world. So that's why we voted out. Simple, right? Well, Theresa May thinks that means still being in the EU but technically not being in the EU. That of course has pissed off Brexiteers and Remainers alike and is why she is pretty much useless. \n\n- Islam - \n\nIslam, contrary to what many say on conservative pages, is a small percentage of the country as a whole and is not mostly refugees as many I have seen saying. David Cameron barely let any refugees in (though many just came over illegally but A for effort).\n\nMost of our Islamic population is people who came over from Pakistan and Bangladesh after the partition of India in 1949 and so have been here for decades and have had time to have kids and grandkids who have assimilated into British culture. There is not problem with these people.\n\nHOWEVER, there are some that don't assimilate and do things like form grooming gangs. Now the main problem is not that there are a huge amount of them doing it, but that they are protected and validated by Liberals as would happen in the US. That is the issue and why Tommy Robinson was trying to show ALTHOUGH he did openly break the law by filming their faces before the trial and antagonising them (whether what he did should be against the law is up for debate). \n\n- Our Media -\n\nThe media in the UK is generally biased, tabloid style out of context rubbish regardless of political affiliations. The Daily Mail, The Mirror, The Sun, The Independent the list goes on (though some sources like the Times and sometimes the Guardian are fine) and of course our mandatory BBC which generally leans to the liberal side, but the news is generally alright and some of the shows are really good, though I disagree with the license fee on principal. \n\nOur media generally seems to exaggerate everything, and take things out of context for a story, and is pretty much doing a great job of trying to tear the country in half, kind of like the media in the US. \n\n- The Queen -\n\nQuick notes on the queen though you probably already know this:\n\n1. The Queen stays out of Politics\n\n2. The Queen has only ceremonial power\n\n3. The Queen makes the state \u00a3230,000,000 per year in profit from tourism and land holdings\n\n4. Fun side note, the queen was trained by the army before anyone knew she would be heir and so she definitely knows how to shoot a rifle\n\n- Gun Rights -\n\nGenerally gun ownership was very low even before the ban, which is why we have relatively low gun crime (we have knife crime instead hooray!), especially as we have good measures of keeping them out of the country. However, guns are not totally banned, I live in an area where many people legally own a rifle or shotgun for hunting. Generally though, most western countries outside the US (except Switzerland of course) have very low gun ownership anyway so it isn't all that surprisingly. The US is wonderfully unique in that respect. \n\n- Conclusion (aka what am I on about) -\n\nI pretty much wrote this to defend my country and show how our population aren't all liberals but like the US are split, and to explain our current situation and how we got there (and why our only other choice was a bearded communist).\n\n\nRant over","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The State of the UK right now"}

Starship trooper-esque government overreach, or making sure only the bakers have their fingers in the pie? I would suggest that after leaving school, students should have to complete three months national service, which can include work on infrastructure projects, and that all men and women (unless mentally incapable) be proficient to a B standard in Maths (yes it has an 's,' bloody colonials), English, the three natural sciences, art and music. They must also be healthy, i.e. not obese (no need to be a muscle bound greek God either).\n\nPersonally I believe the three months service would open the eyes of a lot of privileged kids to the real world, and that people with a stake in society already will be more inclined to properly safeguard it in the future. If you are unable to meet the academic standards you can choose to be held back, or leave school but be unable to vote. The same may apply to the national service, i.e. you are not forced to play ball.\n\nFor reference, I am not an old man, I'm 21, but I do believe the past couple of generations have lost their way. Those who have not been educated under this system and are now adults would still have the right to vote. In your opinions is this a good idea, or government over reach? Should we all have the right to vote? This is assuming we have the money to fund such a system. Looking forward to seeing the responses from fellow conservatives.\n\nEdit: for the Americans the grading is to 'GCSE' standard, which in America is equivalent to the grades you achieve age 16, expecting B's in Maths, English, Biology, Physics, Chemistry Art and Music at the end of high school (equivalent of our A levels) is too much, high school would proceed as normal and national service would take place after high school.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The right to vote, should it be earned?"}

I haven't gotten terribly far yet, but it occurs to me that people who aren't encouraged to be independent and self-reliant would ultimately be more hypersensitive to perceived \"discrimination\", more reliant on the government or university to solve their problems, etc. This of course ultimately has an effect on culture as well as politics, and the worst part is that you can't teach what you don't know, so even if such people want their children to be more independent and self-reliant than they were, they'd be reliant on others to teach them. It becomes a dying art.\n\nThat being the case, my own insecurity is starring to get the best of me, and I am looking to compile resources on the types of things we as adults should be learning, but for whatever reason aren't.

But don't believe it for a second.  When we look a little closer into the liberals' mindset, we find that they don't really want him impeached.

The same talking points would be being spouted, the same witch hunts against anyone who dares to even think that capitalism isn't the root of all human evil would be happening, and the same rallying cries of \"not my president\" would be popping up on message boards across the country.\n\nDemocrats are not against Trumpism.  They are against morality.  If we don't understand this we will be overrun.  This will not change when Trump is no longer president.

I am so proud to be an American and have the right to sit here today and express these thoughts. I\u2019ve tried to voice my concerns but it feels like such an all or nothing argument coming from the left.

I am getting severely pissed off with how people are reacting to any little thing Trump does. In the beginning it was funny, you know \u201chaha lel look at the angry woman cry at his inauguration\u201d, simple stuff, but now people are on the verge of shitting themselves over him. And I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s most Democrats, it\u2019s just the people who spew their thought vomit all over Reddit. First of all, Theresa May deserves all the harsh criticism he might\u2019ve given her. The Chequers plan is retarded, and Trump is right for wanting a hard Brexit. Secondly, why must he be so reverently respectful of the Queen? We fought a war so he didn\u2019t have to bow down to her and act like she\u2019s a divine being. Finally, Russia. Russia isn\u2019t even close to being a shadow of its former self. It will never be the USSR again no matter how badly Putin wants it to be. There\u2019s no reason for people to act like Trump being like \u201cwho cares about election meddling\u201d is treason of the highest order. Is election meddling bad? Of course, but the left is in absolutely no position to all of a sudden be holier than though when Obama meddled in our greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel\u2019s elections against Netanyahu. Russia isn\u2019t our greatest enemy anymore. We\u2019re the only superpower left in the world, no matter how badly the EU wants to act like they can rival us. I for one would LOVE to see Trump pull out all our troops from Europe and leave them in the hands of their own armies. I\u2019d love to see the UN\u2019s \u201cdestruction\u201d of the American Superiority Complex when Russia\u2019s tanks come rolling through, if that even happens. And what\u2019s the issue with trying to improve relations with the country that used to be our biggest adversary? Why are people frothing at the mouth over the idea of us trying to spread our philosophies to our former enemy? They are communist anymore, and there\u2019s no reason to act like they threaten our very way of life. Hillary was going to lose the election either way, and they can\u2019t handle it. They\u2019re just setting themselves up to be absolutely demolished in 2020. I think trump is reminiscent of President Ford, in that he\u2019s trying to move the country away from a time of turmoil, for us being the election of 2016, and everyone thinks he\u2019s evil for it. But this time, instead of a competent opposition party, you have the fearmongering Democrats whose only platform is \u201cEnd Trump\u201d, and it\u2019s not going to work. If all you did was browse Reddit you\u2019d think that Trump was all that defined America, but it\u2019s not, and Trump wants to try and focus on all the other problems that come knocking on our door.

In August 2005, just seven months after his swearing-in, Obama traveled to Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine with then-Indiana Republican Senator Dick Lugar, touring a conventional weapons site. The two met in Kiev with President Victor Yushchenko, making the case that an existing Cooperative Threat Reduction Program covering the destruction of nuclear weapons should be expanded to include artillery, small arms, anti-aircraft weapons, and conventional ammunition of all kinds. After a stopover in London, the senators returned to Washington and declared that the U.S. should devote funds to speed up the destruction of more than 400,000 small arms, 1,000 anti-aircraft missiles, and more than 15,000 tons of ammunition.\u201d\n\n2.

Anyone who acts like *hacking us* is the reason why Putin is an evil piece of shit over all of the other horrific things he had done prior to Bush making that statement is a clown. Bush still had to deal with him. Trump still has to deal with him. Expecting presidents to be blatantly rude when they are trying to get some diplomatic deal done is idiotic. Could Trump have used slightly better rhetoric? Sure, but that\u2019s about the harshest level of criticism that\u2019s warranted, not the sobbing hysteria of people acting like this is some cataclysm and that the sky is falling.\n\nThe media will never give you this context.

{"author":"sgtpepperspineapple","created_utc":1531844878,"num_comments":1,"score":2,"selftext":"I think what happened to us is multi-faceted, and similar to the 2008 crash it's going to take another few years for people to truly understand.  These are three parts of the story that I happened to have a unique experience with.\n\n# The Domestic Picture 2014 - 2016\n\nIn 2014 I became involved with a progressive leadership group similar to the Aspen Institute.  In reading about youth programs in my political science coursework, I would say this was an Obama-era youth leadership group.\n\nIt became apparent to me a) this group was global b) this group was connected c) this group had an agenda.  I'll give you an example.  They forbid a speaker in the mining industry from ever speaking again after the \"normalization\" of mining offended a tree-hugging activist in the group.\n\nThis group had a mix of those who had attended \"elite\" schools, those who came from wealthy families, international people, and \"hard leftists\" who probably got their start in the Occupy Wall Street days.  There were undertones of want for socialist and communist economic models.\n\nAfter the Ferguson events, this group became ignited.  At some point (likely after), George Soros' foundation became a sponsor\/partner.  Peter Thiel had been a partner prior.  The agenda most closely resembled want for solving world problems at a global scale with global cooperation.\n\nThe \"hard leftists\" in the group got a pass when their language was obviously a mix of a) violent b) encouraging of violence c) targeting of particular groups of people based on issue d) racially\/sexually charged.  As a moderate, I felt these effects racially and because I was straight; a group member who was gay accused me of being homophobic after he made sexually questionable advances.\n\nThe group chose to rationalize and \"normalize\" any behaviors that marginalized straight white men almost as a sick exercise to even the scales.  If you didn't join in the violent condemnation, you could be a target was the basic lesson.\n\nRather than stoop to their level, I took a back seat and stopped engaging this group.  Other events began to occur in our country on college campuses.  Notably, at schools like Yale there were deliberate attempts to silence people who did not comply with what became known as \"social justice\".  In short, in a bizarre twist the progressives new brand of seriousness\/exclusion\/silencing on the basis of race\/sexual equality started to look more and more like fascism to me.\n\nWe can put aside that this group fed off of my young desire to get leadership training.  Basically, this group was descending into the mob-like mentality that must have been born within the confines of groups like Anonymous and Occupy Wall Street.\n\nAs we got closer to the election, I saw this group amp up its misinformation and a notch-up of \"f\\*\\*\\*-the-police\" messaging and aggressive silencing of dissent.  Given the international nature of this group, I had inclinations that there was foreign influence.  Given the connectedness of members of this group and the \"elite\" pedigree of many members, I suspected political opportunism fusing into the very real and wrong mob-like mentality this group allowed to exist.\n\n# The Technology Picture 2014 - 2016\n\nHere in my life, I became a data scientist.  In particular, I was attempting to create data mining software for the web to inch us closer to the semantic\/web 3.0 that has received more coverage since.  I also acted somewhat as a security researcher, inadvertently finding data widely available where it shouldn't have been.  In the 1980's hackers found their way into banks, and in the 2010's it's less sensitive information but information if put together can be very powerful.\n\nAt this time, I'm aware that America has a unique information policy compared to the rest of the world.  What I am seeing in the data picture is that our data is wide-open for others to come in and take.  I'm not seeing much benefit or gain returned back to us.  When I assess my experience at technology companies comprised mostly of foreign workers, I start to seriously evaluate the political messaging I'm seeing.\n\nIn fact, for the election season I had a discussion or two to become a data vendor for a political consultancy (Democrat leaning).  The promise was to provide a semantic assessment of every article in the US every day.  The daily report would contain references to any political candidates and whether the journalism was favorable\/not favorable.  Then, contact information from the journalist would be provided so that they could be contacted by the candidate's constituents.  Surprisingly -- not surprisingly -- the company was backed by Chinese money apparently.  This factoid only fused into my brain six months after the election had ended.\n\nDuring the primaries, I tested some of the polling systems.  It was easy to prove from a security research perspective that the online polls were hackable.  You could have made Chris Christie the top candidate every time if you wanted from your home computer.  I alerted a few media outlets not to rely on online polls, and sure enough at least Megyn Kelly's show seemed to listen (hurray, success -- you're welcome).  The thought did cross my mind if the Trump campaign utilized this \"exploit\" to an advantage.  If I recall, I did notify the Trump campaign about the online poll exploit.\n\nAs we got closer to the election, it seemed clear that our media was capitalizing on Trump's zingers.  Everyone thought Clinton was the obvious win.  I took a road trip for work months before the election and even in California only saw Trump signs.  It's possible that Clinton's followers either all lived in cities or that they had been convinced that signs were bad for the environment.  However, it was odd to see only Trump signs like that.\n\nWhat became obvious to me as well was the Facebook also was capitalizing on the mania.  If anything, Facebook seemed to bake in a political agenda given its algorithms.  The agenda would be consistent with how most of Silicon Valley was thinking in 2014-2016.  Middle-American Christians had been the enemy of rational progressivism for more than a decade.  Facebook seemed to identify a profitable alignment with the protesters just as the leadership group had turned the cheek to fuel a violent mob to carry a political agenda.\n\n# My Assessment of Trump\n\nDuring the primaries, I viewed Trump mostly as an amateur who was picking apart the given data that I could find.  Recall, I was a data scientist\/data miner and made it my business to know the available data.  Three prevalent facts were on my radar to depict the American political landscape:\n\n* gun ownership requests were at an all-time high\n* we were at a trade deficit with nearly every country\n* immigration was at a 40-year 10-year high meaning between 2006 - 2016, the immigration numbers were highest with a slight dip if adjusted for population growth\n\nThese facts helped me see the \"news feed\" differently to prevent myself from getting mixed up with misinformation.  I felt:\n\n* Americans are feeling the need to protect themselves\n* We don't have good accountability while there's a set of actors advocating socialism\n* There really isn't a believable immigration issue\/case for \"not enough immigration\" if I factor my first-hand experiences and overview of the numbers\n\nGiven this matrix of factoids, it seemed to me as though Trump was behaving as an altruistic guy looking to earnestly connect with the issues.  When he started punching the political spin in the nose, the guy actually began to earn my respect.  When this caused the mob-like mentality, the social media, the political opportunists, the foreign actors to double down on the double-speak -- I only became more convinced.\n\nThere were a lot of shows and media that tried to understand how Trump \"managed to pull it off,\" but from my point of view there's this one guy speaking into a microphone about what he experiences and what the data presents itself as whereas everyone else is acting like they've lost their mind and are hell-bent on racial\/sexual equalization and civil rights over every other issue known to mankind.\n\n# My Conclusions About Interference\n\nWere there possible attempts by Eastern European actors to subvert the online polls, hack emails, and get into the voting systems (without success)?  Sure, I'd believe it.  However, I think it's questionable that this is tied to the Russian state.  It does seem possible that Julian Assange was used as a cut-out of sorts by the Russian state.  I don't think this is all that was going on.\n\nIn fact, I think none of this would have been possible if it wasn't for Facebook.  The misinformation that Facebook was a vehicle for had a far more significant impact than any Russian interference could have had.  Julian Assange's release of CIA\/NSA hacking methods was far more damaging than hacking a DNC email server.\n\nWas Clinton a victim?  In hacking efforts, yes.  However, there seemed to be political opportunism in the very same Black Lives Matters uprising likely inflamed by Russian state actors (if we're believing it as fact that Russians interfered).  In my view, it's much more likely that a mix of Russia\/China\/Iran played a role in igniting the Black Lives matter movement.  This would have been the more obvious fulcrum to create destabilization with.  Black Lives Matters would have been the attack vector executed because it sought to racially divide us as a country when diversity is inherent to our values.  It played on want for economic opportunism and I think without foreign interference, it would have been a more peaceful movement that was less focused at undermining the police.  There were a lot of brilliant alignments thrown together to truly !@#$ed with the population during BLM.  You can evidence this by trying to convince someone of this argument and facing a huge amount of resistance in response.  But with time and provided there isn't any more psychological warfare I think it will all make sense.\n\nI didn't answer the question.  Was Clinton a victim?  I think Clinton like Obama knew all of this was going on.  I think they stood to benefit politically from the foreign interference, and they turned a blind eye to foreign actors like George Soros because they felt this would enhance trade deals that fed back into their constituents which largely would have been comprised of by tech companies.\n\nSo awkwardly, the collusion does seem to be within the realm of the Democrats within my view.  Except it's not breaking any election laws from what I can tell.  It's just very dirty politics and it's a poor show of self-gain on the basis of items as trivial as race\/sex from what I can tell.\n\nThe political thinking from the Democrats is that we're all due for a \"demographic shift\" to become a white-as-a-minority country.  When I see fellow citizens and even friends engage in racial remarks about, \"poor whitey is just scared of becoming obsolete,\" I'm reminded of the fascist undertones on college campuses like Yale of silencing dissent.  There's merit to racial equality, but unfortunately it's received the same aggressive (if not more extreme) posturing that climate science receives.  The want is to control people's behavior at the micro-level to accelerate social changes because this group of people truly believes in the urgency of these \"issues\" and the lack of viable mechanisms to bring about change through policy.  The problem with this thinking is that manipulating these forces runs counter to the political ethos of our country, and it comes off as an abuse of power.  Democracy is inherently slow and wanting to disrupt social order in a matter of a year when social order found its equilibrium over a much longer timeframe borders on the Orwellian ideas to fuse technology to overcome biological limiters.  People who behave aggressively like this seem to do so at a cost to civility, and I view that as \"un-American\".  The double-speak is offensive to cast people opposing this as being racist (which is totally ridiculous).\n\n# Policy Proposals\n\nThere are a variety of laws that do govern the collusion I saw.  Some of the actions probably would have constituted civil offenses and I'm sure if brought to scrutiny would end a couple of careers.  Let's outline the areas to cover:\n\n* non-profits participated in political issues -&gt; stricter standards for financial shelter from IRS\n* foreign actors funded non-profits on political issues -&gt; stricter standards for financial shelter from IRS\n* Facebook profited from spreading misinformation -&gt; whew... can-of-worms... likely fine them to oblivion please! :)\n* other tech companies were profiting from the erosion caused by the globally wanted mob -&gt; traditional anti-trust laws can apply to companies like Amazon to demonstrate people are greater than shareholders when the business is at a particular scale\n* policing is somehow inadequate -&gt; let's have innovation conversations about what 21st century policing and criminal justice means when a computer can predict what color your poop is let alone if\/when you'll commit a crime\n* our information ecosystem is only hurting us -&gt; instead of \"Mexico wall\" let's consider a digital wall maybe?\n* there is some easily accessed information out there that likely culminated in a number of hacks -&gt; let's better define an information security model for individuals for the 21st century\n\nThere are many other policy issues within technology that are more proactive and less reactive.  The industry is working on some of the proactive pieces, but as \"usual\" they are doing it whilst practically ignoring regulatory accountability.  If anything, what modern technology companies do is *rationally maximize profit in lieu of the law*.  It's an amoral strategy that has shown us in 2016 leads to bad ends.  Wall Street thinks different from you and I, though.  It wouldn't matter for people to be dumb unless you consider the life-altering potential of computers and the extreme moral perils of allowing these emerging technologies to self-regulate.\n\nWhen Wall Street kicks the can down the road with insane valuations based on abstract quantifiers, you mind-bogglingly head-scratch at the utility of government, and in fact government is and has been undermined by the private sector.  In the picture I was seeing 2014 - 2016, we were extending beyond the red zone of \"economic crash\" and into \"social chaos\" with these power plays.  Getting the numbers picture so out of whack seems like ultimately it can only culminate with people losing their minds. It's not just the meaninglessness of accounting to justify the technology companies soaking up people's data and buying up former competitors.  It's that we lose the ability to fairly exchange in just about every facet of life from speech to goods and services.  We lose the privacy picture and descend into human rights risks that we can't easily come back from.\n\nAs for Hillary, I think the voters spoke.  I think miraculously, the American dream of individual autonomy and ability to see reality uniquely spoke that the collusion going on was so bad voters voted against it for a man that gratuitously runs his mouth and makes George W. Bush look articulate.\n\n# The Path Forward\n\nI think I'm a progressive.  I'm starting to put aside my anger that people were so self-motivated they were turning a blind eye to wrongful mass manipulation and shouting violently for equality while eroding it.  I'm starting to remember ideas like preserving the environment, and I'm beginning to see and consider perspectives I didn't consider before.\n\nAt the same time, Donald Trump remains some kind of bizarre exercise of my 2nd amendment rights.  My 1st amendment rights were being violated by my fellow citizens.  Economically, we were and have been doing a pathetic job of policing fair economics in technology which found a vehicle for cemented power in the Democratic party.  I felt that was and has been appalling.  In short, Donald Trump can have my vote if \"progressives\" don't address these issues.\n\nI would have to hope for peaceful democracy.  I would have to hope that if there truly is civility people would see Donald Trump couldn't possibly be doing what he is any longer at this point for self-serving interests.  There is so very little that man had to gain by running for office, and now that he's had a giant shitpile dumped on him, really the only chance I see is for him to gain a very mild approval.  And yet, I think he has become many Americans exercise of the 2nd amendment and he will remain that way so he can work on the issues as a human being would.\n\nI am and have been totally appalled at learning the political views of other people.  It makes me question who the internet gives a voice to and if that is right\/what it means.  I would hope the focus of policy is in fact on the internet itself whether it's economic or security topics.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n\\-Citizen","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"1st-hand Remarks on the \"election collusion\""}

I am also subscribed to liberal subreddits so I can get opinions from both sides. Thanks for helping me out!\n\n**2nd amendment**: a few loopholes need to be closed and some weapon control measures need to be put in place but the 2nd amendment is a key part of our nation's constitution and should remain that way\n\n**Abortion:** It should be illegal after the 3rd month but before then its the woman's choice because completely outlawing it would be governmental overreach.\n\n**Budget and Economy:**\n\n* Reinstate Glass-Steagall\n* Bring back manufacturing jobs with the condition that factories abide by environmental protection measures\n* Cut military budget by a lot\n* Reduce national debt\n* Capitalism not corporatism\/ crony capitalism\n\n**Civil Rights:** \n\n* There is racism present ( echoes from the past) but concrete measures shouldn't taken because time will fix it\n* Sexism is not present in America\n* People of all genders except pedos should be OK to have rights\n* No safe spaces, no trigger warnings, no to other SJW things etc...

I think the last civil conversations we had occurred just days before November 8, 2016. You were supremely confident Hillary Clinton would win the presidential election; you voted for her with glee. As a lifelong Republican, I bit down hard and cast my vote for Donald Trump. Then the unimaginable happened. He won.\nAnd you lost your freaking minds.\n\nI knew you would take the loss hard\u2014and personally\u2014since all of you were super jacked-up to elect the first woman president. But I did not imagine you would become totally deranged, attacking anyone who voted for Trump or supported his presidency as a racist, sexist, misogynistic, homophobic Nazi-sympathizer.\n\nThe weirdness started on social media late on Election Night, as it became clear Hillary was going to lose. A few of you actually admitted that you were cradling your sleeping children, weeping, wondering what to tell your kindergartner the next morning about Trump\u2019s victory. It continued over the next several days. Some of you seriously expressed fear about modern-day concentration camps. Despite living a privileged lifestyle, you were suddenly a casualty of the white patriarchy. Your daughters were future victims; your sons were predators-in-waiting. You threatened to leave Facebook because you could no longer enjoy the family photos or vacation posts from people who, once friends, became Literal Hitlers to you on November 8 because they voted for Donald Trump.\n\nI admit I was a little hurt at first. The attacks against us Trump voters were so personal and so vicious that I did not think it could be sustained. I thought maybe you would regain your sanity after some turkey and egg nog.\n\nBut you did not. You got worse. And I went from sad to angry to where I am today: Amused.\nAs the whole charade you have been suckered into over the last 18 months starts to fall apart\u2014that Trump would not survive his presidency; he would be betrayed by his own staff, family, and\/or political party; he would destroy the Republican Party; he would be declared mentally ill and removed from office; he would be handcuffed and dragged out of the White House by Robert Mueller for \u201ccolluding\u201d with Russia\u2014let me remind you what complete fools you have made of yourselves. Not to mention how you\u2019ve been fooled by the media, the Democratic Party, and your new heroes on the NeverTrump Right.\n\nOn November 9, you awoke from a self-induced, eight-year-long political coma to find that White House press secretaries shade the truth and top presidential advisors run political cover for their boss. You were shocked to discover that presidents exaggerate, even lie, on occasion. You became interested for the first time about the travel accommodations, office expenses, and lobbyist pals of administration officials. You started counting how many rounds of golf the president played. You suddenly thought it was fine to mock the first lady now that she wasn\u2019t Michelle Obama. Once you removed your pussy hat after attending the Women\u2019s March, you made fun of Kellyanne Conway\u2019s hair, Sarah Sanders\u2019 weight, Melania Trump\u2019s shoes, Hope Hicks\u2019 death stare; you helped fuel a rumor started by a bottom-feeding author that U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley slept with Donald Trump. You thought it was A-OK that Betsy DeVos was nearly physically assaulted and routinely heckled. You glorified a woman who has sex on camera for a paycheck.\n\nYou have learned all kinds of new things that those of us who didn\u2019t willfully ignore politics for the past eight years already knew. For example, we already knew that illegal immigrants were being deported and families were being separated.\n\nSome of your behavior has been kinda cute. It was endearing to watch you become experts on the Logan Act, the Hatch Act, the Second Amendment, the 25th Amendment, and the Emoluments Clause. You developed a new crush on Mitt Romney after calling him a \u201csexist\u201d for having \u201cbinders full of women.\u201d You longed for a redux of the presidency of George W. Bush, a man you once wanted imprisoned for war crimes. Ditto for John McCain. You embraced people like Bill Kristol and David Frum without knowing anything about their histories of shotgunning the Iraq War.\n\nClassified emails shared by Hillary Clinton? Who cares! Devin Nunes wanting to declassify crucial information of the public interest? Traitor!\nBut your newfound admiration and fealty to law enforcement really has been a fascinating transformation. Wasn\u2019t it just last fall that I saw you loudly supporting professional athletes who were protesting police brutality by kneeling during the national anthem? Remember how you fanboyed a mediocre quarterback for wearing socks that depicted cops as pigs?\n\nBut now you sound like paid spokesmen for the Fraternal Order of Police. You insist that any legitimate criticism of the misconduct and possibile criminality that occured at the Justice Department and FBI is an \u201cattack on law enforcement.\u201d While you once opposed the Patriot Act because it might have allowed the federal government to spy on terrorists who were using the local library to learn how to make suitcase bombs, you now fully support the unchecked power of a secret court to look into the phone calls, text messages and emails of an American citizen because he volunteered for the Trump campaign for a few months.\nSpying on terrorists, circa 2002: Bad. Spying on Carter Page, circa 2017: The highest form of patriotism.\n\nAnd that white, male patriarchy that you were convinced would strip away basic rights and silence any opposition after Trump won? That fear has apparently been washed away as you hang on every word uttered by James Comey, John Brennan, and James Clapper. This triumvirate is exhibit \u201cA\u201d of the old-boy network, and represents how the insularity, arrogance, and cover-your-tracks mentality of the white-male power structure still prevails. Yet, instead of rising up against it, you are buying their books, retweeting their Twitter rants and blasting anyone who dares to question their testicular authority. Your pussy hat must be very sad.\n\nBut your daily meltdowns about Trump-Russia election collusion have been the most entertaining to observe. After Robert Mueller was appointed as Special Counsel, you were absolutely convinced it would result in Trump\u2019s arrest and\/or impeachment. Some of you insisted that Trump wouldn\u2019t last beyond 2017. You quickly swallowed any chum tossed at you by the Trump-hating media on MSNBC, the New York Times and the Washington Post about who was going down next, or who would flip on the president.\n\nFor the past year, I have watched you obsess over a rotating cast of characters: Paul Manafort, Donald Trump, Jr., Jared Kushner, Carter Page, Reince Priebus, Jeff Sessions, Michael Flynn, Steve Bannon, Sam Nunberg, and Hope Hicks are just a few of the people you thought would turn on Trump or hasten his political demise. But when those fantasies didn\u2019t come true, you turned to Michael Avenatti and Stormy Daniels for hope and inspiration. It will always be your low point.\nWell, I think it will be. Each time I believe you\u2019ve hit bottom, you come up with a new baseline. Perhaps defending the unprecedented use of federal power to spy on political foes then lie about it will be the next nail in your credibility coffin.\n\nThe next several weeks will be tough for you. I think Americans will learn some very hard truths about what happened in the previous administration and how we purposely have been misled by powerful leaders and the news media. I wish I could see you as a victim here, but you are not. I know you are smart; you chose to support this insurgency with your eyes wide open.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The truth"}

The intellectual Dark Web is not full of backward people but people who are intellectually honest.\nMainstream academic is completely dishonest and bankrupt because it\u2019s centred around political correctness (the premises of which I won\u2019t go into here) and not empirical reality. \n\nWe have people who have been programmed all their lives with a set of values and who often don\u2019t have the intellectual ability to see past their programming. We then have a kind of political Stasi force in organisations to maintain the \u201ccorrect\u201d beliefs.\n\nI will provide examples. Let\u2019s say you bring up the question of whether feminism has an real issues in the Western world today, or only non-issues; these people think in black and white and form an immediate knee jerk response. The initial knee jerk response is one of shock, horror and faux outrage. The reaction is not to actually respond on the subject matter and make an argument about the real issues of feminism. The response is based on the belief that the proposer is a bigot with an outdated set of beliefs that needs to be re-educated. \n\nThe same goes for bringing up the argument that there are no instances of oppression and prejudge leading to differences in group outcomes, and this is caused by different abilities and preferences in the group. The person who proposes this is an outdated bigot who needs to be reformed from their antiquated views from 1860 (even though these are cutting edge views developed in 2017\/2018).

Yes, I greatly disdain pedophilia and other grave actions that are also in the same category as pedophilia but knowing the context of shock\/dark humour (since most of his old tweets appeal to satirical and dark humor), James Gunn's primary comedic style on his past works and just simply the context of a joke should give enough sense to it.\n\nThey were deemed offensive and I understand why. But it's quite odd to know that those tweets that had been resurfaced was posted 11 years ago. James Gunn actually addressed the issue about his \"offensive\" tweets and apologized to it years ago. Weird thing to realize is that Disney hired him years ago as well and I think it's safe to assume that they must be aware about his past tweets.\n\nIt is also stated that James Gunn stepped\u00a0in to defend\u00a0fellow filmmaker Mark Duplass after he faced extreme backlash for recommending Ben Shapiro and James is also an outspoken Donald Trump critic. Clearly he is visible and vulnerable via political means.\n\nBut what really bothers me the most is resurfacing of the said tweets (brought by Mike Cernovich and #MAGA) bothers. I greatly question the ulterior motives of resurfacing those.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------\n\nRealizations:\n\nI'm the type of person who really scrutinizes the context of each situation. I do not get offended as much when tweets like those or any jokes that exist is bombarded at me. Yes I do know my limits and borders on what can you call \"offensive\" but I try not to be shallow as any usual snowflake and I know what is the difference between satirical humour and blatantly offensive because of context.\n\nAs much as possible I do not want to get upset by the least possible things that I completely disagree on the internet and use them as political weapons, wielding it on everyone's faces to show that my sentiments on a certain political issue should be held on a high pedestal. I do not want to get upset because I greatly disdain outrage culture. Outrage culture destroys the true quality of productive discourses, which is by exchanging opinions through dialectic basis, not on dumb competition. As this type of culture can be greatly seen on Twitter. The constant lashing of hate and getting offended every time you disagree on twitter with almost no justifiable reason occurs everyday making it a very useful weapon. Even if it's a decade or a 100-year old tweet and someone weaponizes them against you, that kind of act clearly denies the capacity for someone to change and forgive and take things only on a superficial level, not considering context at all.\n\nLastly, the James Gunn issue is not a new thing. Celebrities or political figures who had malicious acts or political disagreements before are now being constantly pegged-down buy media outlets or by average people. In his case, he was brought down by Mike Cernovich (constantly labelled as part of the alt-right. Would love to hear your sentiments about him). Clearly, this issue has political ulterior motives.\n\nI'm just really bothered by the aforementioned issues and somewhat scares the shit out of me, especially with Twitter culture. It bothers me because I can feel the gravity of the situation due to the people I'm always with. That's why I love using Reddit, it's built for dialectical methods.\n\n\\----------------------------------\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on the aforementioned issues...and if this has something to do with the modern social progressivism.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Thoughts on outrage culture, weaponization of twitter and the recent James Gunn controversy"}

The wisdom and learning of men that had been studied for centuries has been pushed aside, and forgetting it would be detrimental to society as a whole.  Many people know the names Julius Caesar, Augustus Caesar, and some of the Emporers, but so many great Romans have been sadly forgotten, and one of those was Cicero.  I could have chosen a number of Roman writers, like Seneca, Cato, or even Marcus Aurelius, but from a young child, when I thought of famous Romans that weren\u2019t Emperors, Cicero was always the name that came up.\n\nCicero was arguably the last of the great thinkers of the Roman Republican period.  He was a brilliant legal mind, and many of his courtroom speeches as well as political speeches are remembered to this day.  A prolific writer, his preserved letters was a bedrock of classical education for centuries, and his works inspired not just the Renaissance but also the American revolution.  Thinkers from St. Augustine to Erasmus, to Luther, to John Locke.   John Adams said, \"As all the ages of the world have not produced a greater statesman and philosopher united than Cicero, his authority should have great weight.\"  Thomas Jefferson considered Cicero to be of paramount importance a well.  \n\nWhen some of the greatest names in Western history have nothing to say but glowing praise for the thoughts of a man, modern society should not only remember him, but should be focusing on his work and drilling into the heads of their children.\n\nI give you one of the greatest minds in Western Culture, Cicero.\n\n**There is a true law, a right reason, conformable to nature, universal, unchangeable, eternal, whose commands urge us to duty, and whose prohibitions restrain us from evil. Whether it enjoins or forbids, the good respect its injunctions, and the wicked treat them with indifference. This law cannot be contradicted by any other law, and is not liable either to derogation or abrogation. Neither the senate nor the people can give us any dispensation for not obeying this universal law of justice. It needs no other expositor and interpreter than our own conscience.**\n\n--Cicero\n\n**UPDATED** - Added the quote for those on mobile version of reddit.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Quote of the Week - Cicero"}

I  realized that I was not agreeing as much with was hip or \"current\".\n\nAs I became more conservative my friends started to call me an \"extremist\". It was a joke at first, but then I realized that everything that they didn't agree with is the 'other extreme'. As my views changed, and the political climate turned more and more hostile, my friends and I just drifted apart. I'm not the type of guy to brings up politics all the time, but it seems like lately, I can't escape it. Every movie discussion, every TV show analysis turned political. I'm don't want to talk politics all the time, but I'm not going to roll over in agreement just because I don't want a discussion or argument. \n\nMy family is very liberal. We're a complex bunch, we live between L.A. and Spain. Historically my family has been a member of the Spanish left, but I don't agree with their views anymore. Slowly but surely I've been pushed away from them. They just don't want anybody second-guessing their pity parties when they talk about how oppressive the \"extreme right\" is. \n\nAnd now I look at the media and most of what I see being advertised is just political propaganda. A show or film is no longer good or bad. They are *important*. Every late-night is now a political pamphlet.  I've found myself watching old movies because I feel that's the only way I can escape it. The same thing has happened to music or books. \n\nRight now I'm in Spain and I feel like I'm becoming not an island, but a man on a raft. Drifting further and further away. I work in a creative industry so most, if not all, the people I meet are very very liberal. Left of the democratic party. \n\nI'm a few years out of college now. I'm successful in my area of work. I keep trying to better myself as a person. But I feel this is pushing me away from people somehow. \n\nAm I the only one going through this? Did it happen to you? \n\nP.S. Sorry for the long rant.

California...). What are some good conservative universities that offer psychology\/art therapy programs (will be an art therapist for veterans with PTSD and other disorders) at known red states such as TX, NC, and GA? I don't feel like having a repeat of going into a college that does nothing but virtue signal about leftists ideologies (i.e., supporting illegal immigrants, calling the travel ban a \"Muslim ban,\" gun control, and so on) and dehumanizing the Trump administration overall.  Thank you all in advanced, can't wait to hear your insight! :)\n\nEDIT; thanks a lot for the comments! I'll PM if I have any questions.

{"author":"SillyConclusion0","created_utc":1532340637,"num_comments":10,"score":87,"selftext":"Hello. I\u2019m going to relate an anecdote that illustrates the possible dangers of taking trans kids too seriously. I know the title is a little flippant and inflammatory but bear with me, I have a genuine and heartfelt story to tell. \n\nI am a 21 year old man. But I was an extremely gender confused boy. \nAutistic, raised by a single mother, very mentally ill. I was more girl than boy for about a decade. I was a lonely, fat, ugly and effeminate child with a lot of emotional baggage. I exclusively got along with girls. I didn\u2019t have a single iota of maleness about me, and it stayed that way for a long time. But thank God I was never approached by a trans positive school counsellor, I was never labelled trans, and my identity as a ten year old was never taken seriously. Thank God for that, because if they did, my life may well be ruined. \n\nIn time and with guidance, I started to discover what it meant to be a man, and my identity fell into place relatively normally. \nWhat absolutely terrifies me, and this is where the danger lies, is that if you told me, as a kid, that I was a girl not a boy, and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t fit in, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m sad all the time, I\u2019d have believed you, fully committed to it, and happily mutilated my body in the name of transgenderism. You\u2019d have given me an explanation for a lifetime of ostracism and suffering and I\u2019d have martyred myself in its name. \nBut since gender was never an important consideration to me, and no trans-positive school counsellors tried to change that, I grew up into a mentally healthy man, son and brother.\n\nI know that a kid like me, growing up in 2018, may very well end up labelled \u201ctrans\u201d, and be deprived of an opportunity to grow up without political and medical interference. If I grew up in 2018, my life would be ruined. My mental health only evened out when I discovered values of masculinity, strength, competence, etc. Had a doctor validated my femininity, and had I been given treatment or surgery, I would be living a broken life. \nI\u2019d be another drug-addicted rainbow-haired LGBT activist with  severe mental health issues, forced to live out my existence in an indoctrinated state of confusion and misery, deprived of the chance to grow up. \n\nI know my anecdote doesn\u2019t prove shit. But it goes a certain distance to explaining the possible consequences of this \u201ctrans kids\u201d shit. And I wonder how many vulnerable, confused children have already been harmed.

I\u2019m going to relate an anecdote that illustrates the possible dangers of taking trans kids too seriously. I know the title is a little flippant and inflammatory but bear with me, I have a genuine and heartfelt story to tell. \n\nI am a 21 year old man. But I was an extremely gender confused boy. \nAutistic, raised by a single mother, very mentally ill. I was more girl than boy for about a decade. I was a lonely, fat, ugly and effeminate child with a lot of emotional baggage. I exclusively got along with girls. I didn\u2019t have a single iota of maleness about me, and it stayed that way for a long time. But thank God I was never approached by a trans positive school counsellor, I was never labelled trans, and my identity as a ten year old was never taken seriously. Thank God for that, because if they did, my life may well be ruined. \n\nIn time and with guidance, I started to discover what it meant to be a man, and my identity fell into place relatively normally. \nWhat absolutely terrifies me, and this is where the danger lies, is that if you told me, as a kid, that I was a girl not a boy, and that\u2019s why I don\u2019t fit in, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m sad all the time, I\u2019d have believed you, fully committed to it, and happily mutilated my body in the name of transgenderism. You\u2019d have given me an explanation for a lifetime of ostracism and suffering and I\u2019d have martyred myself in its name. \nBut since gender was never an important consideration to me, and no trans-positive school counsellors tried to change that, I grew up into a mentally healthy man, son and brother.\n\nI know that a kid like me, growing up in 2018, may very well end up labelled \u201ctrans\u201d, and be deprived of an opportunity to grow up without political and medical interference. If I grew up in 2018, my life would be ruined. My mental health only evened out when I discovered values of masculinity, strength, competence, etc. Had a doctor validated my femininity, and had I been given treatment or surgery, I would be living a broken life. \nI\u2019d be another drug-addicted rainbow-haired LGBT activist with  severe mental health issues, forced to live out my existence in an indoctrinated state of confusion and misery, deprived of the chance to grow up. \n\nI know my anecdote doesn\u2019t prove shit. But it goes a certain distance to explaining the possible consequences of this \u201ctrans kids\u201d shit. And I wonder how many vulnerable, confused children have already been harmed.

We are minorities and I am a traitor for being conservative, I have lost ties to my heriatage by not siding with other minorities I've been told. Despite sticking up for truth I have been kicked and spat on (figuratively...liberals are usually only big to talk, unless they can hide their faces) and yet conservatives are considered backwards and heartless. Contrary to what most people think, discrimination occurs from these posturing liberals who look down at anyone on the right wing spectrum as if they are morally bankrupt with elitist gaze. Its come to a point where I dare not touch any politics at work at a tech company so as to keep up the team and have to stay in the closet on things I deem true.  \n\nThe left is a cancer on sensible ideas, yet those that follow it are the most vocal. I'm not sure what can be done to stop it from spreading. I have to do my part and speak up, at the cost of comfort I guess.

I guess they didn't understand that policy that fits 98%+ of all abortions is perfectly fine policy and that using the 2% fringe-cases of abortions is a very poor defense.\n\nAlso, if a woman were to abort her child and abortion were illegal, what would be the punishment for breaking that law? It's obviously a very hard choice to abort a child; there's enough emotional trauma already, but law is law so I feel as though there must be a punishment but am unsure what that punishment would be.\n\nFinally, also I'm curious about stem cells. I believe that stem cell research has great potential, and that stem cells in general are great, however, since they come from embryos, I'm wondering how that affects the child.\n\nThanks for everything. I'm a very recent conservative; I supported Bernie for a lot of the 2016 election cycle until I swallowed the red-pill early this year :)","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Abortion Discussion\/Pro-Life Platform Help"}

{"author":"Rightquercusalba","created_utc":1532796610,"num_comments":1,"score":6,"selftext":"My responce to someone in this subreddit  who claimed we don't understand socialists.\n\n&gt;A lot of them want a piece of the capitalist pie and have been screwed over. By dismissing them you are making them indignant and giving them further ammo.\n\nCapitalists create the pie, socialists think they deserve to be the pie makers just because they are educated and work hard. Sorry, everyone already enjoys a piece of the capitalist pie, they consume it every day.\n\n&gt;**1. People with education and degrees are struggling to find relevant work.**\n\nThat's the problem, they pissed away opportunities to discover relevant work. They were sold the lie of \"follow your passiins, do what you love. So they end up with worthless degrees in saturated markets with overpriced educations.\n\n&gt;A lot of them put a ton of work into university, got a degree and did \u201ceverything right.\u201d But struggle finding a job in their field because the job requirements for even entry level jobs typically require years of experience. I\u2019ve seen entry level jobs that require five years of experience. When you see enough of that you become demoralized that you did everything right only to end up with a job as a waitress. Are some of over privileged and think there should be no hardship? Maybe. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s often much, much harder to find a job in your field these days even if you have the required education.\n\nThat's because they didn't do everything right. No surprise that socialists believe in some form of the labor theory for value. Work hard, do everything right, expect to get paid a living wage AND pay off insane debts. Like someone who didn't go to college who thinks that you should get paid to dig holes and fill them back up, after all they worked hard to do it, they should be rewarded for it.\n\n&gt;**2. Bosses and companies that guilt trip you into overworking.**\n\nThese are the same bosses that understand that if you you walk away or quit, there will be somone else to replace you because despite your complaints, your wages and benefits are pretty damn good all things considered. That's why one persons overworking is another person's work ethic and drive to succeed. \n\n&gt;What made me socialist wasn\u2019t college. It was working my first job out of college. We were paid above minimum wage and yet guilt tripped into working 12-14 hour days. Some 60 year old woman would work from 5 in the morning to 9-10 at night every day and it still wasn\u2019t enough for our bosses. And even if you worked an 8 shift they\u2019d be like,\u201dwhy can\u2019t you be more like her?\u201d Essentially, we have a situation where many jobs want you to give your lives to them. Sometimes while working for peanuts. Don\u2019t assume that they don\u2019t work hard. Many of the socialists I know work two jobs. They are trying the best they can. They just don\u2019t beleive in the system at all anymore.\n\nMy 57 year old mom works circles around illegal immigrants in a factory, making 13 bucks and hour after 30 years. You know why she does it? Because she is a hard worker and that's just part of who she is. She is the one literally kicking coworkers in the ass when they are slacking or pretending they don't understand English and playing grab ass with female coworkers.\n\n&gt;**3. A lot of them have to make the choice between going to the hospital and just letting something heal on it\u2019s own.**\n\nWelcome to life, it's rough at times and yet the vast majority of Americans have first world problems and often choose to waste money on things they don't need and end up foregoing things they do need. That doesn't means that people don't suffer out of no fault of their own. But let's be real, the average poor American lies like a king relative to 50% of the world's population.\n\n&gt;Medical expenses are so high that they outright don\u2019t want to go to the hospital even if it could be life saving. Because the last time they went to the ER they got a thousand dollars worth of charges for being there for two hours. Related, they see big pharma hike life saving medicine to ridiculous prices and get away with it. As seen in that insulin price hike a few years back.\n\nAnd that has nothing to do with capitalism. Every single country with socialized medicine that isn't a shithole like Cuba is capitalist. \n\n&gt;**4. They feel the country values corporations above the common man**\n\nThe common man owes their first world problems to capitalists and evil corporations are just a means to attack capitalism and pander to the common leftist\/victim.\n\n&gt;This is self explanatory. When a company like Amazon is predicted to become the first trillionaire company while the employees have to live on food stamps, this pisses them off even further.\n\nThis is why I can't stand socialists or their natural progression when they realize socialism fails (Democratic Socialists) Do you honestly believe that the average Amazon employee HAS to live on food stamps? Or what about the average worker that benefits from Amazon. Do you think delivery drivers make 10 bucks an hour? What about businesses that are able to expand their services thanks to products they can have shipped to them with expedited shipping?Hundreds of companies sell products on Amazon, they pay employees that don't need to be on food stamps. Get out of here with corporations out people on food stamps, it's bullshit. \n\n&gt;**5. The 2008 financial crisis.**\n\nWhat does that have to do with capitalism? Without capitalism you have famine crisis and disease crisis. Instead of people losing homes they lose family members.\n\n&gt;Arguably the biggest influence for the most modern rise of socialism. Bankers committed fraud that caused the Great Recession and Obama pardoned them. This told an entire generation that elites are more important than them. It is one of single handed most disasterous decisions of his presidency.\n\nI agree. \n\n&gt;**6. After eight years of conservative media calling Obama a socialist the word has been desensitized.**\n\nNo it hasn't, that's why socialists have turned to buzz words like Democratic Socialism to take off the edge and pretend that socialism can work if only it becomes part of Democratic institutions.\n\n&gt;Good work, Fox. The over use of the word last presidency made young people look into, and later, consider socialism. If everything if socialism, nothing is socialism. And if nothing is socialism then socialism shouldn\u2019t be feared. And if it\u2019s not feared it will be treated as a good thing because it\u2019s an easy sell.\n\nThat's nonsense.\n\n&gt;**What you should notice is that a lot of them have commonalities with conservatives who voted for Trump. A lot of us agree there\u2019s a problem but we have disagreements on how to fix it.**\n\nThe only thing we have in common is that we understand that the government screws up nearly everything it touches. Socialist sypathizers seem to think that we just have the wrong people in power, that if we overthrow the evil corporations and replace them with benevolent politicians we can fix the \"problem\" of greed and inequality. \n\n&gt;A lot of them furiously believed in the American Dream but don\u2019t see how it\u2019s possible. They no longer believe in any institution of America therefore they believe it should be remade. Multiple things have contributed to this and it is a dangerous position for the country to be in. They overwhelmingly beleive that the country has been taken over by elites who deem them common serfs. And whether you agree or not, a lot of Trump supporters agreed that there was at least a problem. That many average every day Americans were being left out for greed which is precisely why Trump promised to drain the swamp.\n\nYes. The problem is that the elites, whether politicians or heads of corporations that serve as proganda arms for the government have been selling out the country. Getting in the way of prosperity by expanding government and making people dependent on it while advocating for open borders and refugees that will only make the problem worse. \n\n&gt;So because we have many commonalities and agree that many Americans weren\u2019t getting their fake shake, we should try to make our best case for why capitalism works and socialism doesn\u2019t as humanely and empathetically as possible. We must win them to our side.\n\nThe best case for capitalism reveals itself when the government gets out of the way and people are able to afford an education and are able to find jobs that allow them to live a life within their means. People who are busy working, raising families, providing for themselves and loved ones don't have time to bitch about capiatalism.\n\n&gt;We must stress that while capitalism has excesses, that socialism in its largest, purest forms takes away individual freedom and values. Let\u2019s be clear, I am not for pure capitalism just like I\u2019m not for pure socialism a capitalist society needs *some* social programs and workers rights or else we\u2019re just slaves that get paid. We must admit that we are having monopolies dictate American life. As conservatives we must be the first to admit there\u2019s a problem there when a literal monopoly on video sharing services, YouTube, can dictate what is and isn\u2019t okay to be on their site. With them censoring conservative views on YouTube you got to admit that this is attempt of elites trying to control the conversation, that it\u2019s a corporation being placed above Americans. This is the exact thing socialists are against.\n\nYou sound like a Democratic Socialist. Which is a call for socialism without eliminating capitalism. Which means it's not socialism, it's just more big government.\n\n&gt;We must emphasize that we aren\u2019t entirely enemies and show them the merits of capitalism while also disagreeing with any abuse of human welfare under it. By doing that, I believe we can win. But if we plug our ears and pretend there\u2019s no problem and they\u2019re just deluded, selfish, people It\u2019s ours to lose. Because more and more people see socialism as a good thing. We must fight this with a clenched fist and take it **very** seriously.\n\nThere are plenty of problems. Capitalism isn't one of them.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The Problem With Capitalism?"}

Again, no questions!\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**THERE IS MORE TO COME!**\n\nI am not done dissecting their agenda.  This is just one of the many posts I will be making on these monsters.  They have successfully taken control of the Democrat Party, and are coming to a city near you.  They hate free speech, they hate the second amendment, they hate the White Male, they hate the family, they hate the church, they hate the flag, they hate the police, they hate the military.  \n\nI have not even begun to expose who these people are!  Next time I am going to go through statements where they espouse things like complete open borders and legislation against harmful words.  Straight out of an Orwell novel, we will be forced to speak Newspeak if they get control of our country.  They openly oppose our Bill of Rights, and will not stop until it is destroyed, unless they are stopped first.\n\n**CONFRONT,  ARGUE, EXPOSE**\n\nThank you for reading.","subreddit":"walkaway","title":"The Dangerous and Reticent Agenda of the Democrat Socialists.""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The Dangerous and Reticent Agenda of the Democrat Socialists."}

Thursday morning I went into work and about two hours before the end of the day my boss asked me to follow him to a conference room. There was a woman from HR who wasted no time to tell me that today will be my last day of employment. The initial reason for my firing was that since they have switched to a different computer system there is not enough work for me. She informed me that as a student worker my employment is considered temporary and they can fire me at any time without cause. Given that there is another student worker who worked next to me, I asked how the decision was made to fire me instead of her. She declined to answer so I told her she can answer my question now or in a courtroom. She got her supervisor. Her obese supervisor walked in and told me that I am being let go for a \"racist comment\" that was made. I know I made no such comment. I have expressed some conservative viewpoints about Trump's wall which I can understand that some snowflakes are offended by at a university, but I NEVER said ANYTHING racist. I told her she will be hearing from my lawyers and I left. The whole lawyer thing is somewhat of a bluff. My father is a lawyer but workplace law is not his area of expertise so he can't really help me for much more than writing a threatening letter or two. Since technically I was laid off a I asked my boss if he would provide a reference but after consulting with those dogs from HR he \"respectfully declined\" over text message. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do? I have until Monday to file a grievance saying that I was fired incorrectly at which point the firing will be reviewed by a board. I don't want to work with those assholes anymore, I just want a good reference so I can move on to something else. As a 19 year old, this was my first job and it was difficult enough to get so, I need that reference. I really think that they will not give it to me and this will follow me. I don't really know what to do and any advice is appreciated. Thanks everyone.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I got fired for a conservative comment at work. What should I do?"}

Because I am a woman, and therefore I cannot be charged with man-boy love, I felt I had a moral obligation - and I don't recognize morality in most areas of life - a moral obligation to speak out against this kind of persecution in puritan Protestant culture, this persecution of a sensibility that as far as I can see has been intertwined with the highest achievements of art and intellect since the period of classical Athens.\"\n\n\"In her book Sex and Destiny, Germaine Greer says that the standards for adult-child contact in the non-Western world are very, very free. She says that adults take pleasure in physical contact with children, take pleasure in their bodies, in ways that are considered absolutely criminal here. Now this was an utterly explosive and momentous thesis. I totally agree with it, and I think that an authentic queer studies, one based on scholarship and not propaganda, would be pursuing this issue.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/nambla.org\/paglia.html\n\n\"Certainly **Allen Ginsberg, my great hero**, has spoken out on this.\" \n\nGinsberg was a member of NAMBLA.\n\nHere's what Paglia thinks of it:\n http:\/\/archive.li\/e2UwB\n\n**Allen Ginsberg**: \u201cEverybody likes little kids. \u2026 Naked kids have been a staple of delight for centuries, for both parents and onlookers. So to label pedophilia as criminal is ridiculous.\u201d (1997 interview with The Harvard Gay &amp; Lesbian Review)\n\nAgain, Ginsberg: **\u201cPrepubescent boys and girls don\u2019t have to be protected from big hairy you and me, they\u2019ll get used to our lovemaking in two days provided the controlling adults will stop making those hysterical noises that make everything sexy sound like rape.\u201d** (Deliberate Prose: Selected Essays 1952-1995)\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Camille Paglia is pro-pedophilia"}

That makes 3 out of the last 4 presidents disciples of Alinsky, to at least some extent. I would argue they were the 3 most effective modern presidents in terms of changing the country, with the exception of Reagan. No wonder the country is so divided, after 3 decades of these kinds of tactics being used.\n\nI'm not saying Trump shouldn't use them. If they bring a gun to the fight you have to as well.\n\nAlinsky\u2019s 13 Rules for Radicals:\n\n1. \u201cPower is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.\u201c Power is derived from 2 main sources \u2013 money and people. \u201cHave-Nots\u201d must build power from flesh and blood.\n\n2. \u201cNever go outside the expertise of your people.\u201c It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone.\n\n3. \u201cWhenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.\u201c Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty.\n\n4. \u201cMake the enemy live up to its own book of rules.\u201c If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules.\n\n5. \u201cRidicule is man\u2019s most potent weapon.\u201c There is no defense. It\u2019s irrational. It\u2019s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions.\n\n6. \u201cA good tactic is one your people enjoy.\u201c They\u2019ll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They\u2019re doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones.\n\n7. \u201cA tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.\u201c Don\u2019t become old news.\n\n8. \u201cKeep the pressure on. Never let up.\u201c Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new.\n\n9. \u201cThe threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.\u201c Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist.\n\n10. \u201cThe major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition.\u201d It is this unceasing pressure that results in the reactions from the opposition that are essential for the success of the campaign.\n\n11. \u201cIf you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.\u201c Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog.\n\n12. \u201cThe price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.\u201c Never let the enemy score points because you\u2019re caught without a solution to the problem.\n\n13. \u201cPick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.\u201c Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I just realized Trump is using Saul Alinsky's \"Rules for Radicals\""}

{"author":"Horses_On_Stilts","created_utc":1533067730,"author":"A-MacLeod","created_utc":1533036557.0,"num_comments":688,"score":1544,"selftext":"I\u2019ve been seeing and hearing a lot of \u201cif you like socialism look at starving Venezuela\u201d comments all over the media, most recently with Meghan McCain on [The View](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HLwsi7otSoQ) which the Chapo Boys talked about in the last episode and someone asked me for a response to her comments.\n\nThe reason they asked me was that I have a PhD in sociology and more specifically looking at how the Western media covers Venezuela. \n\nI recently wrote a book called [\u201cBad News From Venezuela\u201d](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bad-News-Venezuela-misreporting-Communication\/dp\/1138489239\/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1524768350&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=alan+macleod) which details the enormous disparity between the image of the country and the empirical reality and features interviews with journalists where they admit to not being able to speak Spanish, not leaving their penthouse apartments very often, paying locals to write their stories and knowingly printing fake news about the country. \n\nI also write about the media coverage of Venezuela at [Fairness]( https:\/\/fair.org\/home\/writing-off-democracy-in-venezuela-us-press-and-politicians-dream-of-a-coup\/) and Accuracy in [Reporting](https:\/\/fair.org\/home\/media-delegitimize-venezuelan-elections-amid-complete-unanimity-of-outlook\/).\n\nFirstly, I\u2019ve yet to see any credible study about how much weight Venezuelans have lost. I\u2019ve seen plenty of organizations linked to the local opposition spouting out numbers though.\n\nVenezuelans are hungry in good part because capitalists in the country are intentionally trying to starve them by withholding food in order to provoke an uprising, as they have done numerous times in recent history, for example, before the 2014 elections and in the year of the 2002 and 2002\/3 attempted coups. After decades of neoliberalism, Latin American countries\u2019 food systems are dominated by often a single massive multinational which creates, imports or distributes most of the food. For instance, the company Polar dominates the food market, controlling [over half the flour](https:\/\/monthlyreview.org\/2018\/06\/01\/the-politics-of-food-in-venezuela\/) controls over half the flour in the country (the staple) and also owns a network of supermarkets.\n\nSecondly, Venezuela is also suffering because of the US sanctions, which the UN General Assembly condemned, noting they were deliberately designed to [\u201cdisproportionately affect the poor and the most vulnerable classes\u201d]( http:\/\/undocs.org\/A\/HRC\/37\/L.34) , calling on all states not to recognize them and began discussing reparations that the US must pay to Venezuela. None of this has been reported anywhere in the US media; I have checked.\n\nThe Venezuelan people, unlike us, of course, know all this, and that\u2019s why even during this period the government\u2019s popularity has *gone up* and they convincingly won the recent election. Of course, none of this is to say that the government is good or doing well. I'm actually highly critical of where the government has gone. But if we actually care about facts and context and discussion, this stuff needs to be known, otherwise we are completely ignorant of the situation.\n\nThese are not the only reasons why the economy is bad, [you can read a longer explanation here]( https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/socialism\/comments\/8kbzir\/ive_just_written_a_book_about_the_media_and\/dz6fcfl\/?context=3).\n\n\n\nFinally, if this is proof socialism failed, then Ecuador must be proof that socialism works, as under the socialist president Correa, unemployment fell to a record low of [4%, poverty fell by 27%](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/2013\/feb\/15\/rafael-correa-ecuador-elections) in 7 years all while beginning to bring in [universal free education and healthcare](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/commentisfree\/cifamerica\/2012\/jan\/19\/ecuador-radical-exciting-place) and reducing its debt. Of course, none of this is ever brought up by these people because they don\u2019t want an honest discussion about \u201csocialism\u201d and they don\u2019t want people knowing about these countries.\n\nSo a response in 140 characters would be Venezuelans are hungry because big capitalists in the country are intentionally trying to starve them and because of illegal US sanctions. This certainly doesn\u2019t tell the whole story but is a quick comeback.\n\nOh yeah, and if you are interested in the book but balk at the price, DM me your email address and I could send you a copy of my PhD which is pretty similar to the book.","subreddit":"ChapoTrapHouse","title":"A response to the classic \"what about Venezuela?\"""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I\u2019m not an expert on economics but can anyone explain what\u2019s wrong with this argument?"}
