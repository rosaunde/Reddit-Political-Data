Now I've seen the full depth of liberal hypocrisy with my own two eyes, and they DISGUST ME. At least racists are racist to your face.\n\nA week ago, my girlfriend and I were told to get off a public bus near this tiny little hippie town in Canada, Nelson. My girlfriend is a black girl from London, I'm a Montrealer who passes for white (my father is actually Berber). We've been trying to kick up a fuss about that fact, and aaaaaall the liberals have been studiously ignoring us. I sent tweets and messages to liberal news sources, politicians and journalists. I humiliated trying to get the people of this town to care just so they wouldn't look like racists. I literally told people they should care even if only for the optics of the thing.\n\nProblem is, they are racists. I literally did not get a single word of support from all the liberals in this town who support aaaaaaall the right causes. I took my lock off my door and threw it off the balcony, and everybody was shocked at how un-Canadian I was acting. Many people worried about the lock, but I didn\u2019t get one word of support or concern for my girlfriend or myself. I was deliberately ignored by EVERY LIBERAL PERSON AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS HIPPIE LIBERAL TOWN.\n\nI tried posting on a liberal message board (www.straightdope.com), and I was immediately treated as crazy. My threads were locked and I was banned. They even refused to admit I was getting an unusual reaction. Not one person has even CONSIDERED that my story might be true.\n\nHere is the sequence of events, EXACTLY AS THEY HAPPENED:\n\nOn the February 23rd, my girlfriend and I were told to get off the 33 bus at the Selkirk College stop. Here are the events.\n\nWe get on the bus.\n\nMy girlfriend: Hi, is this the bus to the airport?\n\nThe driver: I don't know.\n\nUs: Stunned silence\n\nMe, tentatively: I have the map here...\n\nThe driver: I don't know. I'm not a cab driver.\n\nUs: More stunned silence\n\nHer: I've just been to the airport.\n\nI start to move aside so the queue can start moving while I double check on my phone.\n\nThe driver: You have to give me tickets or get off the bus. (I actually had two transfer tickets in my hand)\n\nI'm still stunned. I move towards the second door because there is a queue of people behind us.\n\nThe driver: Where are you going?\n\nMe: sheepishly: I was going to get out the second door.\n\nHer: Get out this door.\n\nShe gestures with her head towards the front door.\n\nAt this point, I believed her when she said it was the wrong bus, since she had no good reason to lie. I was just confused as to why she was so rude. Why was it so urgent that we get off the bus? We get out the front door. We brush against people waiting.\n\nThe driver: Have a good day.\n\nMe: Just\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026\n\nI still naively thought it actually was the wrong bus. We walked the rest of the way with backpacks on. Several cars drove slowly past. Then, the bus actually drove past without stopping. This is when gears started turning that there was NO way this was an honest mistake.\n\nLook at the bus route. COME ON.\n\nhttps://bctransit.com/west-kootenay/schedules-and-maps/route-overview?route=33\n\nHere is the thing: maybe it wasn\u2019t racism. Maybe she doesn\u2019t like French Canadians. Maybe she doesn\u2019t like all foreigners. Maybe she doesn\u2019t like city slickers \u2013 we both have city accents. Maybe there is some other reason. SHE SHOULD STILL BE FIRED ON THE SPOT. This isn\u2019t the kind of behavior for which you should be fired if it can be proved it was racism. This is the kind of behavior for which you should be fired for unless you can come up with an excuse.\n\nAnd so, first we complained to BC Transit. They gave us canned responses and stalling tactics. It\u2019s been a week. People are saying these things take time. But it\u2019s not true. I want something very simple: ask her for her version of the events. If she disagrees with the tiniest detail of my account, let her call me a liar. BUT WHY IS SHE ALLOWED TO IGNORE US?\n\nMaybe people think I\u2019ll let this go if they ignore us long enough. What they don\u2019t realize is that I would happily burn their town to the ground to make s\u2019mores for her.\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I was liberal until I started dating a black woman"}

The below  figures are from an official copy of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation tax return for 2014, found on the National Center for Charitable Statistics web site.  You can obtain the latest tax return on any charitable organization there.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation:\nNumber of Employees (line 5) 486\n\nTotal revenue (line 12) $177,804,612.00\n\nTotal grants to charity (line 13) $5,160,385.00 (this is less than 3%)\n\nTotal expenses: $91,281,145.00\n\nExpenses include:\nSalaries (line 15) $34,838,106.00\nFund raising fees (line 16a) $850,803.00\n\nOther expenses (line 17) $50,431,851.00\nTravel $8,000,000.00\nMeetings $12,000,000.00\n\nNet assets/fund balances (line 22) $332,471,349.00\n\nSo it required 486 people, who were paid $34.8 million, plus $91.3 million in fees and expenses, to give away $5.1 MILLION! And they called this a CHARITY?\n\nThis is one of the greatest white-collar crimes ever committed.

I'm a middle school student at a stupidly liberal school, and I feel trapped. Before I start, here's a disclaimer. I know I'm in middle school, and my beliefs will almost certainly change drastically within the next decade or so. But until then, I'm stuck being fed propaganda and being discriminated against for being conservative. Almost every teacher is constantly teaching us liberal viewpoints as fact, or at the very least openly supporting them. Moreover, several students who have female genitals (I wouldn't want to assume ~~their~~ ~~its~~ ~~anyone's~~ anything's gender) are being aggressive towards myself and the two other conservative students I know. When we do have debates and disagree, they use anecdotal evidence and are rude to us. One student has mocked me on several occasions, and I've been called a misogynist, racist, homophobe, and even a nutcase. Not only that, but these students are completely above the rules in every case. They are profane in front of teachers, use their computers during class to watch youtube, have made death threats to students, and have played the victim card every time. I'm so fucking sick and tired of their bullshit, and I'm just about done. I was forced to meet with the school counselor because I supposedly have to learn how to shut my mouth and not disagree with angry feminists. I've found one teacher who's been a bit of a lifeline; he's giving me really solid advice. But as much as I appreciate it, nothing's really changing. The counselor's been telling me to just keep my mouth shut, but I can't do that for the entirety of my educational career. What do I do, Reddit? Ask as many questions as you like; I likely have an answer.\n\nTL;DR: I'm a middle school conservative stuck in a stupidly liberal school. Help.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I Need Advice"}

I see and experience the effects of policy first hand in freight prices and volume along with talking directly with varying levels of management from top to bottom.  In return, the user told me: \"I doubt you've even been to the states, Vlad.\"\n\n\nI wake up with a dick harder than this snowflakes job.  My coworkers and I are the economy on a very basic level.  While this fuck wears a suit and flies around the country (which he probably doesn't and actually lives at home working a McJob), I'm moving product where it's needed and wanted and literally keep the economy moving.\n\n\nYet I'm a Russian.  I'm a \"pathological liar\" and he knows this.  He KNOWS this.    This is a repeat of 2016.  There can be no conversation or debate.  We'll all stop trying and just vote.  2020 will be a Trump landslide and I can't wait to laugh off when it happens.  The best part?  I voted Johnson yet I'm constantly called a Trump supporter LOL","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"How many of us have been called a Russian bot for disagreeing with liberals? Bit of a rant.

I grew up in a very open idea household where at a young age we were allowed to express our thoughts. Because of this I'm rarely irritated by opposing views. I grew up becoming a conservative/libertarian (depending on specific issues). But those ideologies that support my political stance I decided on. It wasn't forced on me. Anyway, I've been in college for the past 8 years of my life. I switched majors twice. I'm currently almost finished with my elementary teaching degree. In my current class I was told that my belief that all students need to learn english is a form of racism and xenophobia. That I'm trying to erase their (the student's) culture if I believe in English first. Again, I'm Hispanic. My family came to this country from South America. They assimilated into the culture of America while also maintaining their culture. But they have always been \"America first\" kind of people. There is no love loss in leaving a country like South America. They had to learn English, they wanted to learn English and they became successful in engrossing themselves in English. There is nothing wrong with coming to a country and wanting what the country has to offer and adapting to it. If these college ass clowns believe that they're going to make me feel any sort of white guilt, or that my beliefs are anti-American they got the wrong mutt. I don't know why I'm writing this, I just needed to vent somewhere. Sorry for the rant.

Day by day, more and more channels and creators are being banned, removed, and demonetized due to their political beliefs.  This project is to form a safe haven that fosters and celebrates free speech.  Creators will no longer worry about censorship or demonetization of their content, and patriots will have a better place to congregate online and spread their ideas.\n\nWe envision a website as easy to use as YouTube, as quick to relay information as Twitter, with the strongest commitment to free speech, privacy, and security. Along with a video streaming website, an app is most definitely on our to do list. \n\nWe need your help to make this a reality.

{"author":"GrieferDenOfficial","created_utc":1520428410,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"For some reason conservatives on reddit are praising politicians such as Babis, Zeman or Fico due to their supposed anti migrant stance. However they fail to realize that these people are polar opposite of right wing populism. \n\nLets break each of them down:\n\n\nAndrej Babis:\n\nThis man has been praised far and wide on subs such as the_donald for his anti-immigrant stance and that he won the election against the \"globalist cucks\".\n\n- He is a [former StB agent](https://domov.sme.sk/c/20759872/babis-definitivne-prehral-sud-s-upn-o-tom-ci-ho-moze-evidovat-v-zvazkoch-stb.html) (Czechoslovak version of the KGB) \n\n- He was a high ranking member of the communist party from 1980 to 1989\n\n- He is anti-small business and his legislation has continuously stifled small business through various regulations and minimum wage increases.\n\n- His business is terribly shady and he only managed to build it up from his connections in the StB \n\n- He claims his party is centrist, yet he was in a coalition with the Social Democrats \n\n- He was involved in a large eurofunds embezzlement scandal. \n\n- Isn't even Czech\n\n\nMilos Zeman:\n\nThis drunk idiot was also praised by some conservatives after winning his election aswell.\n\n- He is a disgrace to the country and cant even form sentences properly as [he is constantly drunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APXDT9lCyxk)\n\n- He has very close ties to China, and actively tries to increase Chinese influence over the Czech Republic. He also avidly criticized pro-Tibet protestors. \n\n- He was the leader of the Social Democrat Party.\n\n- Supported stricter gun control across the Czech Republic.\n\nRobert Fico:\n\nNow this one surprised me the most, if you search Slovakia into reddit, you'll find a post from the donald which praises this man as being somekind of hero. This is utterly ridiculous, he is a corrupt far left politician who is [closely linked to the Italian Mafia](https://i.redd.it/jjnu3jq45xi01.jpg).\n\n- He is involved in a multitude of scandals every year (if he did this in america, he would have a life sentence for just one them)\n\n- He tried to cover up and ignore the murder of the investigative journalist which was exposing his ties to the Italian Mafia and their eurofund embezzlement scheme. Instead of taking action, he put a 1 million dollar reward up to anyone who finds information about the killer. This is fucking ridiculous and pathetic.\n\n- He was a member of the Communist party, and now is the leader of the Social Democrats, hardly the right wing populist.\n\n- When a conservative politician exposed Fico for having 700million dollars hidden in Belize (yet he was a politician his entire life after the fall of communism weird how made this much money) fico [sent out a criminal complaint against him](https://domov.sme.sk/c/7964222/premier-fico-podava-s-manzelkou-trestne-oznamenie-na-matovica.html) and further threatened him. Because thats how you prove that you're innocent right?\n\nNow I could sit here and type out every single scandal Fico and his socialist goons were part of but I'd be here all day. He has stolen more taxpayer money than any politician in slovak history. Which is a big feat. \n\nConservatives on reddit have to distance themselves from these people, they're not our allies but our enemies. Just because they're anti migrant does not mean anything. Every major politician is anti-migrant in those countries, left , right and centre.\n\nDo not listen to some dumb T_D post which claims that any one of these politicians are on our side. They're not. \n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"People here are misinformed about Czech and Slovak politicians"}

I am used to being called names merely for disagreeing with people, but today was quite hard on me. By the way, I am not a \"conservative\" (as I side with the left and right on different issues and I don't just inherit my parents' ideas), but this shit is really pushing me there. I was discussing gun-control with my father, and it escalated very quickly. He isn't a \"leftist\" per se, but regarding guns, he is very anti-gun. He is honest about what he believes, saying that a ban on \"assault\" weapons would be useless, and he actually supports banning all guns. I then brought up facts about how most murders are drug-related, nearly all mass-shootings are done in \"gun free\" zones, etc. He responded, by saying that 1. if guns weren't available then none of those mass shooting would occur. and 2. the government should confiscate all the guns and \"find\" all the illegal guns as well. \n\nTo that, I said that there is no evidence to suggest that taking guns away would decrease the rate of violent crime, and that to \"find\" all the hidden guns would entail an extreme breach of our rights as citizens. And it would be impossible. \n\nIt kinda spiralled from there. He asked what my solution was to mass-shootings since I \"seem to be fine with the status quo.\" He said that I keep talking about our rights to self-preservation but I never seemed to care about \"other people's right to live.\" After about an hour of arguing, he told me that he was \"shocked to have a son that had no regard for human life\" and that I was \"happy that people died.\" and was pissed off at me since. He was \"shocked and disgusted\" by me and my beliefs, and he \"couldn't believe it.\"\n\nThing is, I can take this shit from other people, but when it comes from one of your family members it hurts like fucking hell. I dunno if anyone of you guys has had a similar situation, or what I should do going forward? Seems like whatever fact I pull up has no effect, and it makes him angrier. \n\nI'm sorry for this rant, I guess I seem like a loser but I'm kinda hurting rn. Just wanted to vent a bit. I don't even know a single one of you on here, but I appreciate you reading this as I get it off my chest.\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Really down..."}

{"author":"JohnSemmens","created_utc":1520651493,"num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: March 11, 2018 Edition\n\nSchools Struggle with Religious Intolerance\n\nContrasting styles of how to cope with differing religions in schools were demonstrated recently in Massachusetts and Germany.\n\nIn Massachusetts librarians at Simmons College in Boston issued The Anti-Oppression Library Guide to promote equality and limit religious persecution. The Guide urges students to \"refrain from using trigger words like 'Merry Christmas' or 'God bless you' after someone sneezes because these words constitute microaggressions against Muslims. Muslims don't celebrate Christmas. And the notion that God should bless a non-Muslim is offensive to their faith.\"\n\nThe Guide warns that \"even unintentional or inadvertent use of such trigger words could unleash a violent response that Muslims would regard as fully justified. As far as Islam is concerned, unbelievers are subhumans who must submit to Muslim dominance or face extermination. It is best that confrontations on these matters be avoided if at all possible.\"\n\nIn contrast, in the Peter Petersen Elementary School in Neuk\u00f6lln, Germany the Muslim majority students routinely bully non-Muslim classmates for insulting Islam by eating non-halal food like ham sandwiches or Gummy Bears or for being Jewish. School principal Hildegard Greif-Gross complains that \"the rights of native Germans are being abused by these ungrateful immigrants. We are giving them an education that far surpasses what was available to them in the countries they emigrated from. Rather than appreciating what we are doing for them they are importing the barbaric ways of the countries they left behind.\"\n\nLocal Imam Mulhed Ashat condemned the principal's complaint, calling it \"an insult to Islam. Kafirs have no right to criticize any Muslim for any reason. Allah gave all the world to his believers. Her life is forfeit to the first righteous Muslim who chooses to slay her.\"\n\nIn related news, more Democrat voters in America believe Muslims are treated worse here (56%) than Christians are treated in Islamic countries (47%). This is despite substantial evidence of violent crimes committed against Christians in Muslim countries during 2017, including 3,066 killed, 1,252 abducted, and 1,020 raped or sexually harassed, and 793 churches attacked or destroyed. Almost all of these crimes were carried out by \"moderate\" Muslims, not Islamic terrorists. In contrast, the assaults against Muslims in the United States has averaged 50 per year over the past two decades. A possible explanation for Democrats' mistaken beliefs is likely the discrepancy in media coverage. Muslims in the US have been granted \"victim\" status by the media. Crimes against Christians in Muslim countries have been mostly ignored.\n\nConn Guv Says NRA a \"Terrorist Organization\"\n\nConnecticut's Gov. Dannel Malloy (D) called the NRA \"a terrorist organization\" and announced his state will \"boycott the NRA.\"\n\n\"Their defense of gun ownership goes far beyond legitimate protection of the rights of hunters and ventures into explicitly anti-government intent,\" Malloy argued. \"In their fantastical vision, citizens need guns to be able to fight against tyranny. If that isn't an out-and-out threat to authority I don't know what is.\"\n\n\"Citizens owning guns may have made sense when we were fighting the British for our independence,\" Malloy ventured. \"But times have changed. Under our democracy, the government is the people. It is nonsensical that citizens would any longer need guns to protect themselves from government oppression.\"\n\n\"Ideally, only the government should have guns,\" Malloy contended. \"The next best option would be for the government to extend the privilege to select individuals or groups whose loyalty to the government is without question. These loyal citizens would constitute the 'well-regulated militia' that government officials could call upon to put down rebellions against its authority\u2014as the writers of the Second Amendment originally intended.\"\n\nSenator Says \"California Represents the Future\"\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif) vehemently denounced US Attorney General Jeff Sessions' efforts to enforce federal immigration laws, calling them \"a grievous and doomed attempt to thwart history. California represents the future toward which America is inexorably marching.\"\n\n\"As Gov. Brown so eloquently pointed out, the so-called evils that Sessions claims to be trying to prevent are part of a worldwide evolution toward the more natural way of life being experienced outside of the United States.,\" Harris maintained. \"The notion that Americans can live above the standards that exist in other parts of the world is both selfish and unsustainable. Owning a home with indoor plumbing, heating, and electricity is a luxury that can only be allowed for a small elite. The sooner we reconcile ourselves to this reality, the sooner we will stem the necessity of people migrating here in hopes of a better life.\"\n\nHarris admitted that \"the average American may be ill-suited to adapt to this emerging return to a more natural state of existence. Our saving grace, though, is that under our state's open-borders agenda the vast majority of those entering the country from Latin America and the Middle East are ideally suited to this life style. So, there is a replacement population that is flowing into the country of its own free will. And I am proud to stand with visionaries like Gov. Brown and Mayor Schaaf who are working diligently to accelerate this transformation.\"\n\nPart of Schaaf's diligent work included warning illegals in her city of the recent ICE raid. This enabled an estimated 800 to escape apprehension. Of the 232 caught by ICE, 115 (~50%) had prior felony convictions for serious offenses, such as child sex crimes, weapons charges and assault, or had past convictions for significant or multiple misdemeanors. \"While the 50% proportion of common criminals among the immigrants rounded up by ICE seems high, let's not forget that we force these people into the criminal classes by making them sneak into the country,\" Schaaf reminded. \"If we welcomed them in and gave them apartments, food stamps and other amenities unavailable in their home countries they would have less reason to prey upon our citizens. So, I blame Trump, Sessions, and the other racists who would deny these people their human right to live wherever they choose.\"\n\nPlanned Trump-Kim Meeting Irks Soros\n\nBillionaire donor to the Democratic Party George Soros is apoplectic over the announcement that President Trump has agreed to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un within the next two months to discuss nuclear disarmament of his country.\n\n\"This never should have happened,\" Soros complained. \"I paid $30 million to defeat Trump in the 2016 election. I've funded street protests and riots to try to undermine his administration. I've been working tirelessly with the FBI and media to generate a scandal that will drive him from office. That this Korean twit would wreck my efforts by yielding to Trump's pressures and threats is yet another unexpected setback.\"\n\n\"We were so close,\" Soros lamented. \"The aid provided to Kim by Presidents Clinton and Obama helped North Korea attain nuclear power status. While North Korea could never conquer the United States, the possibility that Kim could've nuked Guam or maybe landed a missile within the US borders should have paralyzed any rational US leader. Trump's maniacal and unfair threat to annihilate North Korea for any attack changed the course of history for the worse. It's beginning to look like our only hope is for the US intelligence community to take Trump out like they took out JFK after he vowed to dismantle the CIA.\"\n\nDem Promises Reparations by 2020\n\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif) promised an audience in Selma, Alabama that \"we will provide reparations for slavery to all African-Americans by 2020 if we take back the House this November. We are going to divert those billion dollar tax cuts Trump gave to corporations and white people and pay off every Black man, woman, and child in America, except for 'Uncle Toms' like Ben Carson.\"\n\nWaters brushed aside difficulties in trying to distinguish between whites who owned slaves and the millions of white soldiers who fought in the Civil War that ended slavery in this country. \"It's not about guilt or liability,\" she clarified. \"It's about racial equality. Those whites who died to free the slaves still had it better than the slaves did. Today's whites have it better than Blacks. Equality demands that this disparity be eliminated.\"\n\nTo help drive home her point, Waters targeted fellow legislator House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's $90 million in personal assets as \"a pot of money we will be looking to redistribute among African-American members of congress. Lord knows I love Nancy like a sister, but she's got to do her sisterly duty by me and the other members of the Black Caucus. Poor old Charlie Rangel wouldn't have had to cheat on his taxes if he could've had a share of Nancy's stash. It's a simple matter of social justice.\"\n\nFor her part, Pelosi pronounced Waters' intention \"noble of heart, but impractical in reality. Those of us in government have got to stick together rather than fight among ourselves over the few crumbs in my bank account. The Federal Reserve can print more than enough money for every descendant of a former slave to get a generous payout. There is no need for her to covet my money. My ability to hold my seat in congress and to campaign for equality is founded on the leisure provided by the income I obtain from my investments. Surely Maxine wouldn't want to take that away from me.\"\n\nWaters tried to reassure Pelosi that \"we're not going to take it all. When you and I are evened out is when we'll stop redistributing your wealth and move on to the next person in line.\"\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: March 11, 2018 Edition"}

{"author":"sylect","created_utc":1520952835,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"I have been listening to some philosophical discussions about the psychology of mass shooters and humanity in general and was intrigued by Tolstoy, who, in wrestling with the reality that people are not inherently good, rationalized 4 methods by which humans escape that knowledge:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n1) People will retreat into childlike ignorance of the problem  \n\n2) They will pursue endless and mindless pleasure  \n\n3) Some will continue to live a life that is evil and knowing that nothing good will come of it  \n\n4) Finally, some will seek to escape it all together by ending their own lives  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTo sit in willful ignorance that every lesson of history has taught us about the nature of humans and to try and wish utopia into existence is to ignore reality and to usher in more evil. You cannot fight against evil by simply trying to suppress bad thoughts or ideas in others and pretend they don't exist. As those who have gone through AA have come to understand, you cannot solve a problem until you admit that one exists. Evil is not produced by implements, evil is produced by bad and toxic ideologies. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhen you look at the product of the willful ignorance that our country has been attempting the last couple decades, you see the rise and acceptance of evil ideologies that constrain thought and individual liberties. They attempt to solve the problem by placing humans in self-made prisons rather than through enlightenment. We now have a plurality of Americans that once again are supportive of the vile practice of eugenics. A majority of my generation doesn't believe in the right of free speech which is essential in combatting evil ideologies. That same group also feels that they have a right to use government to take anything they feel they deserve.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is a ruinous development that mirrors those from the early decades of the 20th century when people of that time were willfully ignorant of the evil occurring. That evil grew to a point where the only solution was in massive violence. My fear is that this time around, there is no country with the moral fortitude to stand against it. More and more, the countries that formed that crucial and moral alliance have collectively buried their heads in the sand as they embrace nearly every bad ideology that they previously fought so viciously against. They seek the cowardly solution and have embraced all four of the forms of escape that Tolstoy acknowledged.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am no paragon of virtue, and I have been lax in my duty to my fellow man and have failed to safeguard the gift given by those who came before me and fought to provide me with the freedom and opportunity I am watching be sucked up by weeds. I am ashamed of my own inaction. I don\u2019t know the answers, but I will attempt to no longer avoid confronting evil where it springs up. Bad ideas must be fought with good ideas. The answer to hearing something you disagree with is to argue against it with logic and reason, not to cower behind anti-intellectualism and emotion.\n\n\nlink to the podcast for anyone interested: https://jordanbpeterson.com/jordan-b-peterson-podcast/","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Jordan Peterson's Most Recent Podcast Gave Me Some Thoughts"}

Some left wing organization, after the florida shooting, spread the word about the walkout and paid schools to organize the events. When the students hear it, half of them dont give a shit and just want to leave class, the other half barely know what they're doing, and maybe 10% actually understand the movement and care about the gun issue. Then, they go tell the media, \"Look at all these students who are demanding gun control!\", when in reality, 90% of the people there don't really know or care.\n\nThe other reason is that I don't agree with the message. The walkout is a protest, and why should I go for a protest that advocates for gun control, when I don't support it? I support the second amendment, an the right to keep and bear arms. Gun control would never work in the US. There's 300 million guns in this country, and the people who do own guns aren't gonna just give them up to the government they don't trust. Even if we ban the sale and ownership semiautomatic weapons, and two thirds of the country turns in their guns, you still have 100 million guns out there, a large percent semiautomatic, and a gun black market will come up and the end result is you'll have more idiots with guns and now you don't know who they are because the sales are underground. \n\nI do feel for the victims of the shooting, but I believe the walkout as it is is corrupt and not fighting for the right cause. I would go if it was non political and specifically for victim memorial, but because it's politicized, I don't want to go to an event that goes against my beliefs.\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I'm a high school student, and my school is planning a walkout.

Sounds impossible, I know... but r/PoliticalPerspectives is willing to try if you are.\n\nMy real goal for moderation is to be different from the other rule-heavy forums or forums dedicated to specific views. I'm looking for all perspectives, and inviting as many political subreddits as I can find.\n\nMy experience on Reddit (and elsewhere on the internet) is that there is a basic pattern of comments designed to shut down discussions, regardless of topic. A pattern as old as the internet, really. That is what I will focus on and ban.\n\nr/PoliticalPerspectives won't tell you you have to cite sources (although I will suggest it) or write a college thesis - like some other subreddits do. I won't tell you what to think or how to think. You can write a \"wall of text\", or leave a simple statement. Up to you.\n\nWhat I will ask, is that you don't use \"Troll\" or \"Shill\" or \"Russian Bot\" or \"Libtard\" or \"Conservatard\" or \"Independentard\" or any base insults. I'll ask that you refrain from telling people what fallacy they are committing or how they are not educated... things like that.\n\nThings I'm sure you are all familiar with, and are sick of reading just like me!\n\nYou can rail against a political perspective, a politician, a political event - all you like. Use sarcasm or irony or satire or just be dead-pan honest. However you do it.\n\nJust don't aim at an individual redditor. Be open to seeing those other political perspectives.\n\nSelf-Posts or Articles are requested. I may reserve the right to remove blogs or youtubevideos and instead ask you to write a self post explaining that view *yourself*, instead. I think most people recognize what mainstream sources are and also those that are not. Let's keep it mainstream. It is US focused, but all political articles are welcome.\n\nThat's my one time pitch. Please ask me any questions you like, or come join me and the 20 others so far in r/PoliticalPerspectives any time and read the sidebar, the articles I've put up, and decide for yourself.\n\n**Special thanks to your moderators here, who seem pretty unique in allowing me to give this pitch!**","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I'm starting a new political discussion subreddit called r/PoliticalPerspectives - intended for every political perspective - and I'd love for you to participate!"}

Today I fucked up and got lazy. But tomorrow I can try again. This might be common sense but as someone used to the victimhood of liberalism, I find it liberating. I\u2019m not saying one size fits all. Someone like Obama clearly has drive despite being liberal. But when I was a liberal I had no drive because there was an endless supply of things standing in the way of my being successful. Today, there is only me and you cannot believe how good that makes me feel tomadmit that it\u2019s my failure for my fuck up. I think certain ideologies fit people differently and I think liberalism eroded my ability to perform my best. When I was a teenager I actually had the mindset of a conservative and self improvement that went away as soon as I left for college. Liberalism lead me to excess. Ithink that for ME,  the more \u201climiting\u201d ideology of conservatism makes me perform my best in a way I cannot describe. Fully believing in the merits of capitalism I feel I have much more to offer and am pursuing as many avenues possible to make that happen. That didn\u2019t happen with liberalism - again, for ME.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve signed up for business classes. That\u2019s why I\u2019m pursuing a master degree. That\u2019s why I\u2019m taking online classes and watching online lectures to be more informed. That\u2019s why I\u2019m waking up at 5 am tomorrow morning to read two different newspapers (adding a third when I get the money) and start my day early so I can be the best and most responsible citizen I can be. I am in no way attributing this kind of drive solely to liberalism (although it can be levied at leftism). I\u2019m just articulating my mindset in relation to both the left and the right. For me personally I think the right just makes me a better person. \n\nThank you for reading.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Coming from liberalism I find the freedom the freedom and individuality of conservatism to be liberating"}

This happened with Voat back when a lot of redditors wanted an alternative-- it got run over with 4chan-tier racists and therefore was a shitty place for genuinely good, freethinkers.

I figured I would compile the evidence that gun control often precedes government mass murder, so you all can use these facts to spread the truth.\n\n1. [1903 &amp; 1910](https://archive.org/stream/TheImperialOttomanPenalCode/OttomanPenalCode_djvu.txt): The Ottoman Empire banned the production or importing of guns or gunpowder without government permission. From 1915-1917, 1.5 million Armenians were rounded up and exterminated.\n\n2. [1918](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_the_Soviet_Union): The Soviet Union immediately banned all gun ownership. From 1929-1953, 20 million dissidents were rounded up and murdered.\n\n3. [1928 &amp; 1938](https://www.nationalreview.com/2013/12/how-nazis-used-gun-control-stephen-p-halbrook/): Germany passed various gun control measures, including banning Jews and \"unreliable persons\" from owning guns. From 1939-1945, 13 million Jews and others were rounded up and exterminated.\n\n4. [1949](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm_ownership_law_in_China): The Communist Chinese government immediately banned gun ownership. From 1949-1952, 20 million political dissidents were rounded up and exterminated.\n\n5. I'm having difficulty finding the exact year, but Guatemala has had very strict gun control, requiring expensive licenses to own a gun, among many other restrictions, since at least 1964. From 1981-1984, 100,000 Mayan Indians were rounded up and exterminated.\n\n6. [1955 &amp; 70](http://www.davekopel.com/NRO/2002/Disarming-Uganda.htm): Uganda made the requirements for owning a gun so strict that it was in effect virtually outlawed. From 1971-1979, 300,000 Ugandans were rounded up and exterminated.\n\n7. [1956](http://www.theacru.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ACRU_GunControl_v3b.pdf): The French government banned gun possession for self-defense, target-shooting, or collecting in Cambodia. Those laws remained after the French government left Cambodia. From 1975-1977, 1 million educated people were rounded up and exterminated.\n\nThis is a short, great read on the subject by [Dr. Jason J. Campbell](https://cahss.nova.edu/faculty/campbell.html). Dr. Campbell's research interests include genocide studies and prevention, the problem of state-endorsed mass extermination and the theoretical understanding of exclusionary ideologies:\n\nhttp://www.academia.edu/486853/Gun_Control_Disarmament_and_the_Threat_of_Genocide_Second_Amendment","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"7 Times Governments Committed Mass Murder After Abolishing Gun Rights"}

If you define a monopoly along the lines of \"a product/service with no similar substitute and has a large barrier to entry, preventing competition\", then YouTube would absolutely satisfy those conditions. With the site controlling [about 3/4 of the online video content](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266201/us-market-share-of-leading-internet-video-portals/) as well as the incredibly exspensive infrastructure makes it nearly impossible for any other provider to compete at a similar level.\n\nI'm not super familiar wit US antitrust laws, but it seems like YouTube could certainly be subject to regulations. However, since conservatives seem to oppose excessive government regulation and believe that the market does a fine job regulating itself, I'm curious as to how others may think of this situation.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"[Discussion] Would you consider YouTube to be a monopoly that needs to be regulated?"}

People flee Illinois to neighboring states like Wisconsin and Indiana to escape the taxes and taxes disguised as fees (stickers for your car, parking, yard waste, you name it, there is a fee for everything).\n_____\n_____\n\nAlthough most of the exciting stuff that is happening in this Illinois primary season isn't in the Federal level, we will list those here first:\n_____\n_____\n**US House of Representatives**\n_____\n_____\n**District 1**\n\n[Jimmy Lee Tilman II](https://ballotpedia.org/Jimmy_Lee_Tillman_II) \n\nThis is a safe democrat seat held by Bobby Rush (D) and covers a good chunk of the South Side of Chicago and extends into the southwest burbs.  It is a predominantly black district, with 51.3% of the population black.\n_____\n**District 2**\n\n[There are three Republicans running for this seat.](https://ballotpedia.org/Illinois%27_2nd_Congressional_District_election_\\(March_20,_2018_Republican_primary\\))\n\n* Patrick Harmon\n* David Merkle\n* John Marrow\n\nThis is another safe Democrat seat on the south side of Chicago and extending along the state line of Indiana down to Kankakee.  Robin Kelly (D) is the incumbent.\n_____\n**District 3**\n\nThis is a safe (D) race and I will not give text to the only (R) on the ballot since he is a self described holocaust denier.  [Here is the Open Letter the Republicans from Illinois wrote to him.](https://archive.is/TGqxP)\n_____\n**District 4**\n \n* [Mark Wayne Lorch](https://ballotpedia.org/Mark_Wayne_Lorch)\n\nThis is another safe (D) seat that Luis Gutierrez is giving up.  It encompasses a very large Hispanic population in Chicago, on the near west sides, at 71.8%.  [It is also listed as one of the top ten most contorted congressional districts in the nation due to redistricting](https://ballotpedia.org/Illinois%27_4th_Congressional_District).\n_____\n**District 5**\n\n* [Tom Hanson](https://ballotpedia.org/Tom_Hanson)\n\nAnother safe (D) district with incumbent Mike Quigley (D) running a somewhat contested primary on the D side of things.  It is in the mostly white part of Chicago, the north and west sides encircling the 4th District.  The only good news is that if Rob Sherman (G) who used to run as a (D) gets enough votes in the general to peel off votes from Quigley to give Hanson a shot.  But it is a long shot.\n_____\n**District 6**\n \n* [Peter Roskam](https://ballotpedia.org/Peter_Roskam)\n\nThis is a lean to likely Republican seat and Peter Roskam is a power house for the Illinois Republican Party.  He was in the rumors to be Speaker of the House when Ryan took it.  Reps decided to run unopposed on this one so that they can focus energy on the general.  Hillary won this district in 2016.  The dems have targeted this one as a key district to pick up and [have fielded some of their best candidates they could in Illinois](https://ballotpedia.org/Illinois%27_6th_Congressional_District_election_\\(March_20,_2018_Democratic_primary\\)).  This one will need to be active to keep in 2018.\n_____\n**District 7**\n\n* [Craig Cameron](https://ballotpedia.org/Craig_Cameron)\n* [Jeffrey Leef](https://ballotpedia.org/Jeffrey_Leef)\n\nThis seat is currently held by Danny Davis (D).  He has voted no on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (HR 36), Kate's Law (HR3004), No Sanctuary for Criminals Act (HR 3003) and the repeal of ObamaCare (HR 1628).  He is the definition of a toe the line democrat having come up through the Chicago political machine.  This is listed as a safe (D) seat.  Leef has the endorsement of the Chicago Sun-Times fwiw.\n_____\n**District 8**\n\n* [Jitendra Diganvker](https://ballotpedia.org/Jitendra_Diganvker)\n\nThis is the seat that was redrawn just to get Tammy Duckworth into congress.  It is the same district that Joe Walsh was in prior to the redistricting.  It is currently held by Raja Krishnamoorthi and is an example of RINO republicans trying to play identity politics like the dems do.  Since the redistricting, it has gone to the dems from 9%-16%.  Reps have struggled to take this one back, but it is still listed as lean democrat and could be on the table for a contested race in November.\n_____\n**District 9**\n\n* [John Elleson](https://ballotpedia.org/John_Elleson)\n* [Max Rice](https://ballotpedia.org/Max_Rice)\n* [Sargis Sangari](https://ballotpedia.org/Sargis_Sangari)\n* [D. Vincent Thomas Jr.](https://ballotpedia.org/D._Vincent_Thomas_Jr.)\n\nThis seat is currently held by Jan Schakowsky (D), the wife of the infamous democratic political operative and convicted felon, Robert Creamer.  This is an example of the mind numbing politics that is Illinois, as a good chunk of this district contains the most Republican in the greater Chicago area.  Thomas has won the endorsements of local papers, but Elleson has the support of the National Republican party.  **Elleson is a supporter of term limits.  He is also the most MAGA candidate on the ballot ([read his answers to the Ballotpedia survey](https://ballotpedia.org/John_Elleson#Ballotpedia_survey_responses).**\n_____\n**District 10**\n\n* [Doug Bennett](https://ballotpedia.org/Doug_Bennett)\n* [Sapan Shah](https://ballotpedia.org/Sapan_Shah)\n* [Jeremy Wynes](https://ballotpedia.org/Jeremy_Wynes)\n\nAnother district that fell victim to the dem redistricting that occurred in 2012.  It used to be a swing district that former Senator Mark Kirk (RINO) won many times as a congressman, but has switched back and forth between Dold (RINO) and Schneider (D), who holds it now.  The Republicans have put up some candidates this time around, including Dr. Shah, who is from the Libertyville area, Jeremy Wynes from Highland Park (pro-choice, pro gay marriage, fiscal conservative who doesn't agree with President Trump on immigration or trade policies), and **Doug Bennett, who is the most MAGA candidate in this race.**  Shah has had a lot of TV ads in this market and will be hard to beat though.\n_____\n**District 11**\n\n* [Nick Stella](https://ballotpedia.org/Nick_Stella)\n* [Constant \"Connor\" Vlakancic](https://ballotpedia.org/Connor_Vlakancic)\n\nThis seat, in the Chicago west collar county suburbs has gone for Bill Foster (D) since the redistricting of 2012. This seat changed hands a lot, with a new rep in there every 2 years since Ray LaHood left, being a rare republican tapped by Obama to head up the US Dept. of Transportation.  Bill Foster has made this a safe dem seat, winning around 20% more votes than his republican challengers.  Nick Stella is strong on borders, security and seems to be the more stable of the candidates that is running in the primary.  Connor Vlakancic is an odd bird, advocating for reforms to redistricting (which could eventually help the republicans since he wants it county based), but also advocates for an alternative graded voting system.  **Nick Stella has the best chance, albeit slim, to beat Bill Foster in the general.**\n_____\n**District 12**\n\n* [Mike Bost - Incumbent](https://ballotpedia.org/Mike_Bost)\n* [Preston Nelson](https://ballotpedia.org/Preston_Nelson)\n\nThis district makes up the southern tip of Illinois all the way north to East St. Louis.  It is a swing district, going for both Democrat and Republican candidates.  It usually goes for the incumbent, but has had some upsets, including the one that Mike Bost won in 2014 on a strong border, America First platform against an embattled William Enyart, whose wife collected on three taxpayer pension funds, and lost his race due to his support of the DREAMers.  Preston Nelson, a 27yo former international model and current network service technician.  He is a Libertarian for Republican Nomination, campaigning on anti-war for most of his platform, but is strong on pro-life issues and is pro-legalization of drugs, which is counter to POTUS.  He is also pro Audit the Fed, and ending the Fed, and against Civil Asset Forfeiture.  If he wasn't running against the incumbent, he would be a great candidate in a swing district.  **Mike Bost has a proven track record of supporting President Trump and is the pro-MAGA candidate here.**\n_____\n**District 13**\n\n* [Rodney Davis - Incumbent](https://ballotpedia.org/Rodney_Davis_(Illinois))\n\nRunning unopposed.\n_____\n**District 14**\n\n* [Randy Hultgren - Incumbent](https://ballotpedia.org/Randy_Hultgren)\n\nRunning unopposed.\n_____\n**District 15**\n\n* [John Shimkus - Incumbent](https://ballotpedia.org/John_Shimkus)\n\nRunning unopposed.\n_____\n**District 16**\n\n* [Adam Kinzinger - Incumbent](https://ballotpedia.org/Adam_Kinzinger)\n* [James Marter](https://ballotpedia.org/James_Marter)\n\nThe 16th is a strong Republican ring around the purple that surrounds Chicago.  Adam Kinzinger has held this seat since the redistricting put him in it.  He has been somewhat of a RINO though, even though he doesn't need to, winning his district unopposed by the dems the last go round and with over 40% margins the previous cycle.  James Marter is a very pro-Trump MAGA candidate with strong creds on border, jobs, pro-life and 2A positions.  He has picked up some key conservative endorsements and Tea Party backing.  **James Marter is the preferred MAGA candidate**, but has an uphill battle against Adam Kinzinger.\n_____\n**District 17**\n\n* [Bill Fawell](https://ballotpedia.org/Bill_Fawell)\n\nRunning unopposed.\n_____\n**District 18**\n\n* [Darin LaHood - Incumbent](https://ballotpedia.org/Darin_LaHood)\n* [Donald Rients](https://ballotpedia.org/Donald_Rients)\n\nIn a district that makes up the middle and western parts of the state, it is a strong Republican seat that is considered safe.  Darin LaHood has been a never Trumper in the past and Donald Rients is a solid conservative that will not play the RINO game that Darin and his father, Ray LaHood have been known to play.  Although it is an uphill battle to unseat and entrenched machine Republican who will get help from the dems should he be faltering during a primary, **Donald Rients is the preferred pro-MAGA candidate in this race.**\n_____\n_____\n\n#For all Illinois Republicans, it doesn't matter if you are in a house district that has a candidate unopposed.

I voted for the guy and will again, despite not being a big fan of the way he uses his tweets, for instance, or we disagree on one or two things on policy, and I think he would do better to work to learn and think and speak philosophically about the policy positions he advocates, rather than emotionally.\n\nI also understand why the left is forced to hate him (Hillary, but more importantly Donald is a liberal heretic who has crossed over to become a meh-left republican (and you can generate more hate for the one who is 90%+ like you except for one 'key' thing, than for the one who agrees with you not at all). The response is twofold: they are giving him cover so his liberal side can be encouraged and can act in liberal's best instance (gun bad), while simultaneously putting him through the media heresy showtrials for having even just a few opinions that the left doesn't hold, and because of that, they are basically forced to commence a daily 30-minutes-of-hate on him for the disagreement), and must be harried and destroyed, like GW was a fundamental liberal that the media could never let slip he was, so had to yell him down), but what's the problem with /r/The_Donald? \n\nI've learned lots of new bits of information from having read all the posts from the last couple of days, interspersed with some bits of humor (wading through the nonsense that's not any better than LateStageCapitalism).\n\nWhile going through, I haven't found one thing that particularly any worse than any of the other political stuff that is permitted to make it to the front page.\n\nI'm certain there are individual commentators who are horrible - like in every political sub.\n\nSo: what I don't get is why the screaming banshees in a united chorus of vicious and constant attacks-posts, hijacking threads to scream about the_donald, made directly to u/spez and others, basically forcing them to take it down, lest the forces of 'good people everywhere' destroy reddit by leaving it,like they are doing to facebook.\n\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Why does most of reddit hate T_D?"}

Full stop. He **fails to understand the opioid crisis is a very complicated public health concern that needs a levelheaded pragmatic approach.** In a Senate drug hearing in April 2016, Sessions commented \"When you see something like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country, the last thing we should be doing is encouraging people.\" *referring to relaxed cannabis legislation*\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; **This is a three dimensional game of chess, and Sessions is playing checkers.**\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt; Jeff Sessions should focus on how Congress crippled the DEA's ability to fight the opioid epidemic. Instead he tramples upon states' rights and recreational marijuana laws. 64,000 Americans died last year from opioids. None have died from THC. In fact, the data clearly lays out that medical marijuana is associated with a 36% drop in opioid abuse rates and nearly a 25% reduction in overdose fatalities.\u201d\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n&gt; So our new policy is to reverse course, ignore what we collectively have learned and continue to lock up those with minor cannabis possession offenses? It has never worked, never will, and in this round of the drug war it's clear government regulators helped get us in this execrable opioid road to ruin!\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n&gt; I am not a cannabis user or advocate, but cannabis law enforcement cost states $3.6 Billion a year. If that same $3.6B could go toward the opioid epidemic, it would save many lives. How many lives will be saved spending the $3.6B on cannabis law enforcement? Zero!, because their lives weren't at risk to begin with. *We were headed in the right direction, certainly a long road ahead, but still the right direction. I am genuinely worried where this seismic shift in drug policy may take us.*\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n&gt; **We cannot ignore the fact that drug abuse is a behavioral problem rather than a law-enforcement problem \u2014 much less a federal law-enforcement problem.** Like other social ills stemming from bad behavior, the drug problem is best solved at the state and local level with education, treatment and support. **This new or 'old,' direction will flood our prisons, further enrich cartels and the drug trade, increase violent crimes all while keeping the addicted sick.**\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt; *It may be the most overused clich\u00e9 of all time. ..... but it certainly applies here.* **The definition of Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. - Einstein**\n\n\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt; * [**We Can't Arrest Our Way out of Addiction**](https://www.usnews.com/opinion/civil-wars/articles/2017-11-30/jeff-sessions-new-war-on-drugs-is-the-wrong-way-to-fix-the-opioid-crisis)\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n&gt; * [The War on Drugs Is an Abject Failure.

This seemed too much like what I would write if I were a Russian propagandist trying to get the American people divided even further, knowing the hive mind of reddit would eat it up as truth as well as irresponsible media outlets looking to get their \"big\" story.\n\nPlease prove me wrong if you can.\n\nThanks to a little something called the way back machine, I've scoured the posts from the other students as well as the Austin bomber and this blog looks to be some kind of propaganda piece put together on March 20th or the 21st, 2018.\n\nThere is no evidence that this blog, nor any of the other student blogs existed prior to March 21st. All dates can be changed/edited in blogger so the dates we see on the posts could have easily been faked.\n\nYou can [see for yourself](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://definingmystance.blogspot.com/) on the internet way back machine that there is no record of his blog at *any* time besides today, March 21st 2018. [Here is a screenshot of the way back machine records for that blog](https://imgur.com/M8UYbSo)\n\nFeel free to take a look at all of the other \"classmates\" blogs. Not one of them has a record of existing prior to today's date of March 21st 2018.\n\n[The main blog for the \"class\" does not actually exist in blogspot.](https://imgur.com/coBKgNx)\n[Another \"student\" profile.](https://imgur.com/nfXCgmN)\n\n[The meta data is scrubbed from the students that have profile pictures.](https://imgur.com/fBl3Ydc) [Link to page](http://metapicz.com/#landing?imgsrc=https%3A%2F%2F3.bp.blogspot.com%2F-ogNaZlMZCII%2FT39qDY1091I%2FAAAAAAAAACw%2F1UEfb6_itx0%2Fs113%2Fpersonal.jpg)\n\nNone of these student profiles exist on the way back machine as far as I can tell.\n\n[I tried searching Facebook for some of these students](https://imgur.com/5CC9OUL), searching their names filtered around Austin TX with no results.This is obviously inconclusive, since people could have (and probably ) moved in the past 6 years... but it's just another red flag which contributes to the stack of evidence that this is a fake.\n\nI can't find a single student by their posted name when searching in the Austin Texas area. Not even people with similar names went to Austin Community College. Again inconclusive, but adds to suspected theory.\n\nAnother red flag is that none of the students have comments on their posts while this is supposed to be some kind of \"discussion\" group, nor do they have other blogs.\n\nI would love to register for the Austin Community College Admissions &amp; Records but don't have time or resources to do that... that's for real journalists.\n\nWe could be witnessing a new methodology from the Russians to spread discontent among US citizens and the world at large. Maybe it is just some malicious individual. Either way, there is no evidence (as of yet) that this is in fact the suspects blog.\n\nDon't let the Russians win!!!

As per usual, reddit upvotes garbage democratic propaganda as \"history\". [Link to original post](http://archive.is/a5Q7m)\n\n&gt;There's no easy way to put this, so I'm just gonna go out and say it: people are morons. I've literally been sitting in front of my computer for several minutes trying to come up with some clever opening line that encapsulates the point I'm trying to make in some grandiose, literary way when I could've just saved myself the time and effort and just out and say that people are morons, and morons are dangerous. In some cases, it only takes one moron to destroy political systems, nations, even civilizations. They just have to be in the right place at the right time. I know I sound like a bit of an asshole saying this, but when we see morons, we need to call them out. Let it be known that they are what they are, and should not be trusted - at least until they stop being morons. Nip them in the bud. Hence, this post.\n\nAh yes, the anointed liberal riding in to save the unwashed masses from the evil right wingers. But if you're trying to save us from this particular \"myth\", you're far, far too late. From the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10Section2b.t-4.html), to [National Review](https://www.nationalreview.com/2012/05/party-civil-rights-kevin-d-williamson/), to [Politico](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/06/the-southern-lie-119406), people have been expounding this exact position for a long time now.\n\n&gt;I was motivated to write this after I stumbled upon this video on Youtube called \"Did the Parties Switch?\" It's a relatively small video, with about 77,000 views as of time of writing, from a relatively small channel with about 32,000 subs to its name. Normally, this wouldn't be cause for alarm. However, the video in question is only just shy of being five months old, and is the channel's inaugural video - meaning this channel has accrued over 30,000 subs in less than five months from nothing. It's growing fast, and, if it isn't called out, I'm afraid it may be making the rounds on this subreddit a little more often in the near future.\nBut anyway, on to the video in question. As can be inferred from the title, the video tackles what the narrator calls at 0:07, \"The Great American Political Party Switch\", or, \"The Switch that Never Happened\" as the narrator later suggests at 0:20. A political paradigm shift that anybody who has read up at all on their history will know as the\"Southern Realignment\".\n\nSaying \"the parties did not switch on race\", which is the claim made, is not paramount to saying that there were no changes from the 1960s and today. The democrats, for the most part, voted for the civil rights act. They flipped on civil rights. The republicans, who had always favored civil rights, never did.\n\n&gt;Broadly speaking, the Southern Realignment was a process which flipped political support in the American South from Democrats to Republicans, whose Presidential Candidates have held the region comfortably from the 1970s until now.\n\nThis is deceptively selective, and even then is still wrong. [1976 saw the south go entirely blue.](https://www.270towin.com/1976_Election/) Bill Clinton managed to carry a deep south state at least once during both his presidential runs. The first time a republican presidential candidate won a landslide in the south without winning a national landslide was not until 2000.\n\nBut also, note the \"presidential candidates\" part. This is intentionally leaving out other candidates. Probably because that undermines the point the author is making, [because republicans did not make serious gains in southern state houses until well into the 1980s and 1990s](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/09/09/misunderstanding_the_southern_realignment_107084.html). If republicans started pandering to southern racists in the 1960s, it's rather odd it took 30 years to have an effect.\n\n&gt;The opinion of many historians is that this realignment was due in large part to the Republican's use of the 'Southern Strategy', or, the targeting of racist whites in the south by demonizing blacks. \n\n[And they would be wrong. The data have been analyzed.](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10Section2b.t-4.html) If the south shifted republican due to racism, you would expect more racist voters, which tended to be poor whites, shift republican more quickly than less racist voters, which tended to be richer whites. This was the opposite of what happened.\n\n&gt;Anyway, back to the \"Great American Political Party Switch That Never Happened\". At 0:58, the narrator claims the two prongs of the 'myth' are \"1) Whites in the South who used to vote Democrat now vote Republican, and 2) Blacks who used to vote Republican now vote Democrat.\" There's a bit of a problem with that second point though. While it is often assumed that, since there was a switch, and black people by and large vote Democrat now, they must have therefore voted Republican before. This is only half-true. While the pre-New Deal Democrats weren't friends of black people, neither were Republicans.\n\nLet me read you the sins of the pre new deal democrats, since the author felt inclined to defend them despite the fact they're like totally not associated with modern democrats in any way.\n\n[Not one democrat in congress voted for the civil rights act of 1875](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1875)\n\n[Not one democrat in congress voted for the 14th amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)\n\n[Not one democrat in congress voted for the 15th amendment.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)\n\n[The KKK was actively present at DNC events.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1924_Democratic_National_Convention)\n\n[Woodrow Wilson had \"Birth of a Nation\" played at the oval office.](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-ca-mn-birth-nation/)\n\net cetera, et cetera, et cetera. This is not even getting into pitiless democratic opposition to anti lynching laws, other civil rights laws, segregation, also by Woodrow Wilson, and so on and so forth.\n\n&gt;It wasn't that black people voted for Republicans, they just voted for whoever wasn't in favor of lynch mobs. Interestingly enough, the narrator of the video argues a similar line of thought, pointing to black voting trends in the early 1930s at 1:23 which display a distinct siding with Democrats post-New Deal. However, rather than point out how this pertains to Southern Realignment - or that showing black people in support of Democrats might invalidate his claim of the \"Great American Political Party Switch\" being the \"Switch That Never Happened\" - the narrator instead goes on a tangent about how the New Deal is racist, Democrats brainwashed black people into voting for them, and free market economics are the way to go for the next 2 minutes and 10 seconds - of an 8 minute video. Although, to be fair, spending a substantial amount of time going on a tangent to propagate your ideology is a hallmark of badhistory.\n\nI don't agree with the video maker here, but the simplest explanation is that black people vote on other issues than civil rights, which is why they were willing to vote for a party that was, in the 1930s and 1940s, incredibly hostile to civil rights.\n\n&gt;When the narrator gets back on topic - sort of - at 3:53, he claims that President Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed the Civil Rights Act, was \"well known for saying this exact quote among his peers: 'I'll have those niggers voting Democrat for the next 200 years.' And this one he said when he appointed Judge Marshall to the Supreme Court: 'Son, when I appoint a nigger to the Supreme Court, I want everyone to know he's a nigger.'\" While the second quote does have some sourcing behind it, the first quote has come under heavy fire. Contrary to what the narrator says, it has not been \"well-documented\", in fact, it might have never been said. The quote originates from Ronald M. MacMillan, a former Air Force One steward whose accuracy and reliability has come into question. He made several claims about LBJ and his family which have been denied, uncorroborated, or in some cases run counter to historical evidence - that quote being one of them (as private recordings exist showing LBJ to genuinely believe in Civil Rights, despite being a bit of a casual racist). But, hey, why let a few facts get in the way of a good ideological spouting?\n\nFirstly, the author just brushes off the fact that the second quote is accurate. Secondly, the accuracy of the first quote is disputed, so we have to look at if it was the kind of thing LBJ would have said. \n\nhttp://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/lyndon-johnson-civil-rights-racism\n\n&gt;As long as you are black, and you\u2019re gonna be black till the day you die, no one\u2019s gonna call you by your goddamn name. So no matter what you are called, nigger, you just let it roll off your back like water, and you\u2019ll make it. Just pretend you\u2019re a goddamn piece of furniture.\n\nWell shit, it does. As it turned out, LBJ really liked the word \"nigger\". He denounced the (republican) civil rights act of 1957 as the \"nigger bill\". [Listen to him for yourself if you don't believe me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1rIDmDWSms)\n\n&gt;At 4:29, over halfway through the video, the narrator finally tackles the actual issue of Southern Realignment - why Democrats lost the South and Republicans won it. The narrator points out that \"this trend of whitey starting to vote Republican begins occurring well over a decade before the Civil Rights Act even passed, as industry from the North began moving south and upholstering all the agrarian industries and creating new cities and suburbs, the people living in those regions started voting more Republican. They were having some economic prosperity and voted for more free-trade economics.\" Woo boy, is there a lot to unpack here. First of all, yes, the trend of the South voting more Republican does have its roots in the 50s, but it wasn't due to Southerners becoming richer. There are two main factors, the first of which is the Second Great Migration, wherein over 5 million African-Americans from the South moved north and west to more economically viable areas. This resulted in, unsurprisingly, fewer black people in the South, giving more power to racist whites.\n\n\nThis is illogical because even by the author's own admission the republicans were not a racist party in the 1950s. Eisenhower forcibly desegregated Little Rock. George Wallace, a democrat, tried to stop him. If racist southern whites were given more power, why would they vote for the less racist party?\n\n&gt;econdly, it wasn't that industry from the north moved South and made everyone richer and therefore more Republican, rather, the South became richer beforehand, which attracted Northerners to migrate south. Consequently, the states with the most Northerners ended up being more likely to vote Republican\n\nThis is actually true, which is interesting because it undermines the rest of his post. Why were the least racist voters(notherners) more republican than more racist voters?\n\n&gt;At 5:31 the narrator states \"White racists... who were rooted in the Deep South, never switched [parties]. They were Democrats until the day they died.\" This is demonstrably untrue. As can be seen in this map of the 1964 election between Lyndon B. Johnson (D) and Barry Goldwater (R), Goldwater won all the traditional states of the 'Deep South', and nothing else (save Arizona). This was the first time since 1876 that a Republican carried a Deep South state.\n\nThis is flat out wrong. [Eisenhower carried Louisiana in 1956.](https://www.270towin.com/1956_Election/)\n\n&gt;If the narrator is to be believed that racist white Democrats didn't switch parties, then that would require all the racist whites in the Deep South to either die within the span of ten years or never vote again after 1964. Considering we're talking about the 50s/60s, when practically every white citizen of the Deep South was racist, that'd be a hell of a feat (hyperbole, obviously).\n\nExcept as a pointed out earlier, the south did not become solidly republican until into the 1980s and 1990s. [Again, I direct you to Sean Trende's article.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2010/09/09/misunderstanding_the_southern_realignment_107084.html)\n\n&gt;The last two minutes of the video are just the narrator pointing at various racist democrats from the era, including Strom Thurmond at 6:24 (noting how he was the only \"Congressman\" to defect to the Republicans - oblivious to the fact that he was actually a Senator) Al Gore, Sr. at 6:36 (noting how he took part in a filibuster against the Civil Rights Act) and Robert Byrd at 6:52 (noting how he was a former Klansman). I was actually going to skip over this bit in my write-up, because it's not really relevant, but then something came up. Remember when I said I would get back to that thing about r/conservative? Well, when linking to that post, I noticed the mod did his own little write-up about the Southern Strategy and how it's a 'myth'. In said write-up, the mod brought up four examples of racist Democrats. Three of whom happen to be Strom Thurmond, Al Gore, Sr., and Robert Byrd. Not only that, but similar points are raised about the three men: Strom Thurmond was the only Democrat in the Senate (at least the mod got that right) to defect, Al Gore, Sr. voted against the Civil Rights Act and Robert Byrd was a former Klansman. Considering the fact that said mod's source is no longer available, that leaves me with two options: A) most arguments against the Southern Strategy invoke the same irrelevant ad hominems, representing a lack of substantive points, or B) the maker of the video read that post on r/conservative and copied those points down. For some reason I'm leaning towards the latter.\n\nThis is not a substantive critique of anything said.\n\n&gt;Anyway, to finish the video off, the narrator announces at 7:35 that \"there's a lot more to this issue that I'll cover in another video regarding the Southern Strategy.\" It's been almost five months since he posted that video, and he hasn't posted that video on the Southern Strategy yet (although he has found the time to make other videos with titles like \"Hillary Rigged the Election\" and \"PizzaGate Explained\") so I'll just pre-emptively defend the Southern Strategy's existence here (because I know he's going to claim it doesn't exist - and if he doesn't, then I'll edit in an apology for being presumptuous).\n\nHe might not, but I will.\n\n&gt;ny people (the mods of r/conservative included) have tried to discredit or outright deny the Southern Strategy's existence essentially because it means that Republicans have, since the 1960s, sought to use racist dogwhistling and policies to maintain a grip on power. The greatest evidence we have for the existence of such a strategy is, you know, people claiming to create and use it. Take Kevin Phillips for example, one of Richard Nixon's 1968 election strategists and pioneers of the Southern Strategy who told a New York Times Magazine reporter in 1970 that\n\n&gt;From now on, the Republicans are never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the Negro vote and they don't need any more than that... The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans. That's where the votes are.\nAnd that's all I have to say about that.\n\n...and this quote demonstrates your position how? Republicans were losing the black vote even when democrats were in bed with the KKK. This isn't even racist, it's just electoral strategy. Winning voters by not being racist is not racist.\n\nEdit: Also, let it be known that I gave /u/CaesarVariable a chance to respond and he refused. I wonder why \ud83e\udd14\n","subreddit":"ShitPoliticsSays","title":"/r/badhistory is stupid and bad at history, a rebuttal""num_comments":0,"score":19,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"/r/badhistory is stupid and bad at history, a rebuttal [x-post /r/shitpoliticssays]"}

{"author":"JohnSemmens","created_utc":1521877610,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"Omnibus Bill: Dems Declare Victory\n\nThis week, Congress appropriated $1.3 trillion in spending to fund the federal government for the next six months. Despite threatening to veto the measure, President Trump signed it \"for national security reasons.\" Minority Leaders Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) and Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) claimed victory.\n\n\"We got more out of this bill than we did when we had the majority and Obama was president,\" Pelosi boasted. \"The GOP's inability to unite on a program they could all support meant that Republican leaders had to buy Democrats to get enough votes to pass the thing. And those votes didn't come cheap. That the bill has explicit language restricting border fence construction to the same see-through fencing that was already authorized under current law is the 'cherry on top' of our takedown of Trump's agenda. Next up is impeachment after we regain the majority in November's elections.\"\n\nSchumer said \"McConnell's devotion to the Senate's filibuster rules were a key. If he weren't such a flaccid leader he might've corralled a slim majority on a straight Party line vote to pass a budget more in line with Republican campaign promises. But by setting a minimum 60-vote threshold for clearing a filibuster he handed us the whip hand once again.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ken) expressed his gratitude for \"the seminal support from my esteemed colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Without them behind us there would've been no bill. The government would've run out of money and the people of America would've been left adrift without the essential guidance and regulation from the federal that is needed for them to live satisfying and fulfilling lives.\"\n\nWhile he did sign the spending legislation, President Trump was noticeably more muted in his enthusiasm. \"There was a lot of crap in the bill that I didn't want and some important things like the border wall and DACA relief were left out. But we did get a very important $700 billion for our military which, I am told, should give us sufficient firepower to neutralize any future violent threats from former Vice-President Joe Biden.\"\n\nIn related news, Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa) pointed out \"Ryan and McConnell adopted the same appalling tactics thje Democrats used to ram Obamacare through Congress. In both instances the Leadership forced us to vote on massive 2,000 page bills without allowing sufficient time to read them. Pelosi's 2010 quip that 'we have to pass the bill to find out what's in it' seems to have become standard practice now. It's a disgrace.\"\n\nProgressives Stunned by Firearms Poll Answer\n\nIn a poll conducted for NBC and the Wall Street Journal, 58% of respondents agreed that \"gun ownership does more to increase safety by allowing law-abiding citizens to protect themselves.\" On the other side, 38% agreed that \"gun ownership reduces safety by giving too many people access to firearms.\" These results are a significant reversal of responses from 19 years ago when 52% felt that increased gun ownership reduced safety.\n\nChicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called this shift in favor of gun ownership \"dismaying. Considering the carnage taking place on our city streets on a daily basis, I think it's clear that the gun controls we have put in place are insufficient. We need sterner measures to ensure that those with bad intent cannot get their hands on firearms.\"\n\nThe Mayor suggested that \"we should approach the issue logically. Let's assume that the police are the good guys. Each officer has cleared ethical scrutiny and received extensive training in the use of firearms. While we can't expect everyone to undergo such scrutiny and training we could place our trust in those who have. I say let the police decide whose guns should be confiscated on a real-time basis without having to go through the red tape of court orders or probable cause. If a cop thinks a person is dangerous just take his guns away.\"\n\n\"I know some gun nuts will say I'm calling for a police-state,\" Emanuel added. \"But think about it. We didn't see the kind of gun fights we now have in Chicago during Stalin's rule in Russia. Sure, a few people were oppressed and sent to the Gulag, but innocent people weren't being massacred in the streets like they are here in America with our loose gun control policies. Perhaps we should consider giving up a little of our out-dated 'right to bear arms' in exchange for the right not to get shot by our neighbors.\"\n\nZuckerberg Apologizes\n\nThe revelation that a firm working for the 2016 Trump presidential campaign used FaceBook data to aid his election sparked a heavy dose of remorse from founder Mark Zuckerberg. He apologized profusely \"for betraying the values and efforts of President Obama to create a just and noble society for everyone.\"\n\nA particularly aggravating aspect of the Trump campaign's use of data mining techniques via FaceBook was its similarity to what the Obama presidential campaign of 2012 did. \"When Obama's people approached me on the topic of extracting personal data for political purposes, I thought, we're for the same things, and I was glad to help out,\" Zuckerburg said. \"I never considered the possibility that someone else with contradictory political beliefs could replicate Obama's genius. I'm so sorry.\"\n\nZuckerburg admitted that \"my naive assumption that freedom of speech would be enough for good ideas to win out was a big mistake. My people have the skills to subtly impose censorship. We're doing that now through a variety of algorithms. Results over the past few months have been encouraging. The spread of conservative messages has been diminished while to spread of progressive and corporate content has increased. I just hope it isn't too late to undo the damage already done.\"\n\nThe social network mogul also suggested that \"my firm's efforts be formalized via government regulations that establish my algorithms as THE STANDARD for determining what can and can't be posted on any site on the web. FaceBook has two billion users, but there are five billion people using other methods of communicating. If the government were to mandate that everyone use FaceBook, like they mandated that everyone have Obamacare, I'm confident that I could guarantee that everyone is properly informed on all the critical issues.\"\n\nGroup Wants to Ban Gas-Powered Cars\n\nIn California, the Center for Climate Protection is pushing legislation that would ban gasoline-powered vehicles after Jan 1, 2040. A bill drafted by Assemblyman Phil Ting (D-San Francisco) would require that only vehicles relying on \"clean\" technologies could be registered in the state. Even hybrids that sometimes use gasoline would be barred from being registered.\n\n\"I envision a future where the roads are traveled by nonpolluting vehicles using batteries, fuel cells, or wind as their source of energy,\" Ting imagined. \"My favorite, of course, is the wind-powered car. For centuries humans traveled the seas with only wind to push them to their destinations. The ships were elegant, beautiful, and non-polluting. Why couldn't the shorter distances traveled by daily commuters be traversed by wind-driven cars?\"\n\nTing's bill is not without its problems. Batteries and fuel cells are only pollution-free while being driven. The manufacture of new and disposal of old batteries and fuel cells does contribute to pollution. And wind-powered cars could become becalmed on still days.\n\n\"Well, even if these technologies don't work out our increasingly Mexican population could make do with a more traditional mode of transportation,\" Ting postulated. \"Burros are a very familiar way of getting around and transporting freight in Mexico. And they are also non-polluting. So, I think California will come out okay either way. Those who can't shake their dependence on polluting vehicles are free to leave the state and make more room for immigrants who will lead more natural lives.\"\n\nHogg Calls for Students to Seize Power\n\nSchool shooting survivor and anti-gun crusader David Hogg went on a rant denouncing \"the feeble old drones who are ruining our future\" to be deposed by a \"student uprising to seize control of the government and exterminate our oppressors.\"\n\n\"Our parents failed to protect us,\" Hogg charged. \"They have lost their right to rule and maybe even their right to live. They don't know how to use a f*cking democracy. We do! The half million of us who are going to march on Washington shouldn't settle for 'atta boys' and a pats on the head from the generation that has screwed us over. We have the numbers to overwhelm the White House and the capitol, drag the politicians into the streets and beat them to death.\"\n\nHogg blamed the NRA for making his coup necessary, claiming that \"they're the ones who led our weak-willed parents astray. Instead of acknowledging the justice of our cause and urging everyone to lay down their arms, the NRA has bribed Congress to block any sensible limits on guns.\"\n\n\"I tried to be nice,\" Hogg maintained. \"I was willing to consider the possibility that many gun owners might not be bad people. I invited them to join our cause. But almost all of them have rejected my overtures. I reached out to the NRA leadership and begged them to stop manufacturing guns and distributing them to the mentally ill. But the few dollars of profit they got from selling a fully semi-automatic assault rifle to Nikolas Cruz so he could kill my classmates was more important to them than the billions of lives that could be saved if they ceased their malevolent scheme.\"\n\n\"I expect that oldsters will scoff at the possibility that we could succeed in our aims,\" Hogg predicted. \"Let them. Lenin had even fewer on his side when he seized power. Still, he established a new government that served as a shining beacon to all who hoped for a better future.\"\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: March 25, 2018 Edition"}

So this influence is strong within Japan as well and has grown on it's own like a seed being planted in fertile ground.  Then Americans sort of took over the creative aspects of the cartoon's production in the US.\n\nI believe the men who created Voltron were expressing something artistically in 1984 at the peak of the Cold War, perhaps unconsciously, that Voltron represents what is now known formally as [The 5 Eyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes).  This represents an alliance that arguably re-formed itself after breaking up and going into a dormant state (like the 5 lions did) after the American War of Independence.  \n\nThis alliance I am referring to obviously is the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (the 5 lions that form Voltron).  The individual representation of each country can be seen in each lion, with the small green boy as the smallest of the 5 as New Zealand.  The others are less clear and there are multiple good interpretations.  I suspect the orange (fat one) is Australia (big country, small relative population and arid climate).\n\nThis alliance once formed represents the most powerful force the world has ever known, together with the other \"good planets of the solar system\" (representing Japan, South Korea, the rest of Western Europe, and various other peoples in this world who are benevolent in spirit and possess a desire to defeat evil).  In other words, enemies who once opposed this alliance now stand as strong allies in defense of the same ideals after being defeated by it, like freedom, democracy, and human rights.\n\nInspiration in art often comes from places we are not even fully aware of, and so I believe this is a perfect example of that.  As a child I did not comprehend these things obviously, but the show was part of the formative years of my life and did have some degree of influence on my thinking today.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Voltron: Defender of the Universe (1984) made me a conservative as a child"}

This is what I found:\n\nI first looked for how many school shooting gun deaths there have been and to avoid my own potential biases I used the far left stats of the New York Times. So according to NYT's very broad definition of \"school shooting\" there have been over 200 school shootings and 400 people shot after the Sandy Hook shooting (since 2014 according to this site https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/15/us/school-shootings-sandy-hook-parkland.html).\n\nSo the NYT lists 138 people killed in school shootings in the past 3+ years. Vastly less than the propaganda has led me to believe but still, one is too many. (Note: Time Magazine counts 41 school shooting deaths since 2013. Seen here: http://time.com/5168272/how-many-school-shootings/)\n\nSo I thought about how these teens marching in DC could really impact the number of preventable teen deaths.\n\nAccording to the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/motorvehiclesafety/teen_drivers/teendrivers_factsheet.html), in 2015 2,333 teens aged 16-19 were killed every day in car crashes. That's 6 teens EVERY SINGLE DAY. That is a mass shooting massacre every day and yet no one cares. In one year over 23 times the number of teens killed in school shootings over a 4 year period were killed in car crashes.\n\nIt's time to be honest. If anyone were even remotely concerned about teenagers dying, they wouldn't allow teens to drive a car. There wouldn't even have to be an attack on the Constitution.\n\nBack to basketball.\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"March Against Teenage Drivers"}

{"author":"Archaengel","created_utc":1522179629,"num_comments":5,"score":1,"selftext":"I'm a big fan of comic books, superheroes, and their movies. However, I don't feel I could post these thoughts anywhere else on reddit that people might actually appreciate. Also, be warned that if you haven't seen the movie yet, I will be mildly spoiling a certain character's ideals and motivations.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n  \nStill here? OK! So let me just say that I was incredibly nervous before seeing the movie. For one, it's a Disney movie, who is no secretly left-wing advocate. The movie is also deeply rooted in African culture. These two things together could easily to a movie about how white people are the worst and cause all the problems. I'm happy to say that it really wasn't that type of movie. It did have a few moments that felt like jabs to the Right, such as saying that \"Fools build walls while the wise build bridges.\"\n\nThese sorts of things didn't bother me much though, because they was a profound message that resonated as it screamed out to me. The main villain, Killmonger, had a rather interesting motivation and goal. His goal was to bring the weapons of Wakanda to the oppressed people of the world, particularly his fellow people of African descent who are now around the world and obviously America. He hoped to do this because he wanted to empower a people that didn't have the power to rise up. The people who have been on the bottom of the social ladders who have been mistreated and who do not have power or a voice.\n\nNow this is something that really hit me, with what's going on in America right now. How are people failing to connect (or at least talking about) the fact that people are subject to oppression and injustice when they do no have power, or the weaponry to give them said power? **Killmonger felt that the reason that black Americans do not have power to defend themselves is because they lack the firepower to stand their ground.**\n\nThis is exactly what happens to free speech when you do not have the right to protect yourself. Nobody, no government is going to care what you have to if you can't keep them in check. I'll leave you with another comic book reference. \"People should not be afraid of their government. Governments should be afraid of their people.\"\n\nOr as Thomas Jefferson supposedly put it, \"When a government fears the people, there is liberty.\"\n\nThank you for listening to me and hopefully you learned something. I'm hoping to get some feedback and discussing this matter further. Thank you.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Marvel's Black Panther has an amazing Right-Wing message (w/ Spoilers)"}

Our teacher showed us a video talking about all these different genders and how it is never OK to assume someone's gender. It is also OK to be romantically attracted to one gender and sexually attracted to another gender. She has taught us terms about being asexual, transexual, non-binary and genderfluid. From what I hear we have to take a \"survey\" (test) on this pretty soon. I believe that people should be able to choose whatever term that I listed that they want - defended under freedom of speech. However, as far as I'm concerned the \"facts\" that they are teaching us are opinions and If my grade were affected by my \"incorrect\" answers would they even be allowed to do that?\n\nEDIT: Another thing I forgot to mention is that in the semester 1 class, a kid got pulled out for saying there was only two genders. I forgot to mention this at first and it\u2019s a very important detail in this whole event. Is this allowed?

According to the NOAA at least *fifty* people die each year from lightning strikes here and hundreds are severely injured in the *millions* of lightning strikes each year! At least some of them CHILDREN!\n\nIt is time to end this madness. It is time to end this suffering. It is 2018. We should not have to live in constant fear of being murdered by lightning strikes any more. The apathy and the silence must stop *now*. With some simple, common sense, reasonable measures we can stop lightning strikes from killing the tens and tens of lives it claims each year.\n\nThe first place to start is with pools. Nearly fifty percent of lightning deaths involved pools. This is because water naturally conducts lightning and increases the speed at which it can spread by between thirty and four hundred percent. But more dangerous by far are high capacity outdoor pools which can contain seventy five thousand square pounds of water at any given time which is equivalent to seventeen strikes of lightning. Compare this to small, reasonable pools (which are PERFECTLY valid for recreation) that only equate to about half a strike of lightning.\n\nWe need to have reasonable, and also common sense, restrictions on these high capacity industrial pools which serve no real recreational purpose and are only good at killing people with lightning. We need to limit the size of pools to these standard recreational sizes (about two feet in depth and five feet in diameter) which is something *everyone*, regardless of whether or not you own a pool, should be able to get behind as a *reasonable and common sense measure*.\n\nTo further limit the ability of lightning to get its hands on pools when it strikes we need to levy a fifty percent tax on chlorine. Because everyone knows that having less chlorinated water available will deter lightning from striking. It\u2019s just good, reasonably common sense.\n\nAnother non-partisan, common sense reasonableness to enact would be to place insulated lightning rods every fifteen feet. But I\u2019d be happy if we just put them every twenty feet. Note my willingness to *COMPROMISE* to achieve REASONABLE COMMON SENSE! It doesn\u2019t HAVE to be every fifteen feet, it CAN be every twenty feet! The fact that I can COMPROMISE shows just how unreasonable these Pro-Pool hardliners really are. I\u2019m willing to compromise and they\u2019re not. Totally unreasonable.\n\nThe lightning rods will, of course, be paid for by taxes levied on pool water and chlorine. If pool owners want to increase the risk our society faces by owning pools (FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES) then they need to subsidize our protection from their dangerous hobbies.\nIn conclusion, I hope you can join me in supporting REASON and COMMON SENSE. And if you don\u2019t, you want children to be killed by lightning I GUESS!\n","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"Can We Sit Down and Have a Level-Headed, Progress-Oriented Discussion About Lightning?""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Can We Sit Down and Have a Level-Headed, Progress-Oriented Discussion About Lightning?"}

Especially by 2020, having gone through a period where even Normies began to wonder if we'ld see a reboot of the Civil War before the next Batman reboot. \n\nBoth are anti-Deep State/MIC.\n\nBoth are outcasts of the Establishments of their Parties, proving they aren't afraid to be disliked when it matters.\n\nBut, both are generally viewed favorably by the citizenry at large, with low negatives and active grassroots support potential.\n\nFirst native, indigenious, brown, female, Veep, shielding against racism and sexism charges, and making the use of ID Pol by the Left a tenuous proposition.\n\nRand was the first Iowa Straw Poll winner for 2016.\n\nA reliably anti-interventionist, anti-militarism, anti-WW3 ticket.\n\nNeither is particularly displeasing to the eyes or ears of your average citizen.\n\nIt will better allow for the job of president to be split in two with Rand taking on the day to day wrangling with the government apparatus, while allowing Tulsi to be the Diplomat in Chief. Each is well suited for said roles, and the roles are well suited for them.\n\nRunning with a chosen and active VP from the onset will add heft and stability to the campaign. The demonstration of forethought will wash the ticket with an aura of credibility that few, if any, will be able to match at such early stage. This would also attract all sorts of funding, from every level of donor.\n\nThe seemingly impossible nature of such a ticket would result in an inverse slingshot of support should said ticket's possability manifest. Where what was \nonce thought impossible, may soon seem inevitable.\n\nGabbard has travelled to Syria and has experience exposing the Syrian gas attack False Flag, making such an administration better immune to being manipulated into war or bad legislation based off future False Flags, if not being able to prevent them outright.\n\nBy creating an ala carte ticket, this will effectively shatter the establishment 2-Party monopoly in future elections. Whereas now, that monopoly is only fractured, with little promise of shattering anytime soon.\n\nWe're going to get a female POTUS eventually. If a Paul/Gabbard ticket runs 2 terms, and she pulls an 'H.W.' to Paul's 'Reagan', she'll likely only be a 1 termer. She'd have to be a real solid player to pull off that second election, in which case, all the better. Either way, she still gets to trail-blaze and shatter glass ceilings in what is likely the best opportunity she will ever have to do so, with age on her side to boot.\n\nThat being said, it's a ticket that has the real potential to bear fruits for 3, even 4 presidential election cycles.\n\nWe would survive a Gabbard stint in the White House infinitely better than that of a Gillibrand, Warren, Oprah or even Chelsea Clinton admin.\n\nPaul has principles. This makes him predictable in a good sort of way. Also, not being a complete shit politician is a family tradition with him.\n\nIf memory serves, he's actually a doctor as well. Lends a strong hand in knowing exactly HOW to un-fuck our medical system, and makes him one of the very few politicians who isn't just a lawyer.\n\nLikewise, Gabbard is a Veteran, fresh to politics and beyond just another millionaire lawyer.\n\nAccusations of Russian collusion towards a Veteran will require substantial evidence being presented in order to guard against the backlash of tarnishing a Veteran's reputation by accusing her of conspiring with a foreign power, aka Treason.\n\nFurther marginalization of the Democrat Party is only good for America as a whole, regardless where those votes flock to.\n\nThey both have an element of name recognition, Paul more so, making viable the option of running &amp; winning as Independent.\n\nHaving run before, Rand will have a better understanding of what's required going forward, allowing the ticket to bypass first run fumbles.\n\nIowa and New Hampshire are the states that need to be won first and foremost. Nothing happens without at least one of them. They will need to be thoroughly \ncanvassed.\n\nMedia coverage and political habbenings will begin shifting towards Nov. 2020 during the summer/august of 2019, roughly 9 - 12 months after the Midterms, which are only 7 months away from today.\n\nHaving taken the lead in an Iowa Straw Poll, the state is certainly in play for a Paul/Gabbard ticket.\n\nOne policy shift allowing for the commercial production and distribution of hemp and hemp products would open up a whole new crop for American farmers desired by numerous markets domestically and abroad. Hemp is more profitable than corn, and will allow us to dismantle the very counter-productive ethanol mandates. Federal tax aid to help farmers cover the cost of switching equipment and infrastructure from corn to hemp would better sell the deal.\n\nRand won't be able to fix everything, but we will have one of the foremost critics of the Fed in the position to at least begin uncovering and exposing, via use of the Bully Pulpit, some of their workings.\n\nLikely to take on the prison lobby and end overzealous enforcement of bad laws, freeing up prison space &amp; court time for violent offenders.\n\nIssues where the two butt heads on are most likely to be state's rights issues. Making a the come back of 10th Amendment culture necessary in order to set the wedge issue argument bait aside and address the meta issues affecting our federal government. Simply having the Federal government better adhere to the 10th will go a long way in fixing the systemic abuse of such a large Power apparatus.","subreddit":"Liberalist","title":"Rand Paul / Tulsi Gabbard 2020""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Rand Paul / Tulsi Gabbard 2020"}

{"author":"JohnSemmens","created_utc":1522483512,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"Clinton Offers Proof that Trump Is Hurting Economy\n\nAs proof that Trump's policies are bad for the dynamic sectors of the economy that prospered under Obama, former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton cited her drastically reduced speaking fees. In a speech at Rutgers University in New Jersey this week her honorarium was only $25,000--$7,000 less than reality TV star Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi from the show Jersey Shore received from Rutgers for a 2011 appearance and $175,000 less than Clinton's typical asking price before the 2016 election.\n\n\"The few thousand dollars in crumbs being awarded to middle class workers as a result of the tax cut legislation are dwarfed by the severe hardships inflicted on those of us who have to rely on speaking fees just to keep putting food on the table,\" Clinton complained. \"My 'wage' has been cut by nearly 90%. An economy that treats its best and brightest so shabbily is a discredit to the nation.\"\n\nThe pay cut coming after what Clinton described as \"my traumatic loss to the least qualified person to ever win a presidential race adds injury to insult. I'm hoping that voters will remember what I've had to suffer through and punish the Republicans at the ballot box. If we all work hard we can turn back from the unbridled selfish individualism that the GOP wants to force down our throats and renew the commitment to the progressive values of collectivism that President Obama tried to establish during his all-too-brief reign.\"\n\nCongresswoman Blames Lack of Training for Harassment\n\nRep. Elizabeth Esty (D-Conn) apologized for failing to protect female staff members from harassment by her former chief of staff Tony Baker and blamed \"lack of proper training\" for the abuses, which included allegations of \"punching\" and \"death threats.\"\n\n\"Much to my dismay, I discovered that punching and threatening staff members is not explicitly addressed in any legislation,\" Esty said. \"I will attempt to correct this, but can't promise anything since Republicans control both houses of congress. Meanwhile, of my own accord I will be requiring all my employees to complete training in harassment. Hopefully, this will move punching and threatening out of its current 'gray area' status and substantially reduce its frequency in my office. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to be as aggressive as I am in combating this problem.\"\n\nAn unmentioned element of Esty's \"aggressive\" handling of the problem was to recommend Baker for a job at Sandy Hook Promise, a nonprofit organization that was started after the deadly 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Esty's current chief of staff Timothy Daly explained that \"the job recommendation and nondisclosure agreement were aimed at getting Baker out as quickly as possible with a minimum of negative publicity. If the Congresswoman had merely fired him who knows what kind of impact that would've had on her credibility and reelection chances.\"\n\nRetired Judge Calls for Repeal of 2nd Amendment\n\nFormer Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens penned an op ed for the New York Times in which he argued that the Constitutional Amendment protecting a citizen's right to bear firearms should be repealed.\n\n\"When we examine the circumstances under which the 2nd Amendment was adopted it seems clear to me that it was unnecessary on the day it was adopted,\" Stevens wrote. \"At the time, the United States was less than a decade removed from a desperate battle for independence from a government that oppressed those living in what were then British colonies. One of the tactics the British government used was to strictly control and sometimes confiscate firearms. In fact, the battles at Concord and Lexington in 1975 were sparked by fears that British troops were about to confiscate the colonists' guns.\"\n\n\"By 1789, the British overlords had been defeated and expelled,\" Stevens continued. \"It was replaced by a government by, of, and for the people. Those running this new government were elected by the people. Consequently, there were no longer any grounds for fearing a tyrannical foreign power would oppress them. The need for every man to be armed was no longer present. It seems likely that even in the absence of the 2nd Amendment that people's government would have permitted those who needed firearms to hunt or fend off hostile Indians to possess them.\"\n\n\"Today, the vast majority of Americans live urban lives,\" Stevens went on. \"The need to hunt to obtain food is nonexistent and the Indians no longer pose a mortal threat. Meanwhile, the widespread ownership of personal firearms complicates the government's ability to police society. If the 2nd Amendment were repealed the government would be liberated from this archaic infringement on its authority. Under our democracy, the government is the people. There is no risk of oppression and every need for the government to set sensible limits on who has access to guns.\"\n\nPresident Trump branded Stevens' op ed as \"foolish and poorly conceived. Individuals' bearing arms serves as a check on the power of government to do them ill. In countries where the citizens don't have this right the government can ride roughshod over them, like Hitler did. You'd think that the Democrats who frequently compare me to Hitler would be wary of removing citizens' ability to deter government tyranny. Luckily, the people of America are too smart to surrender this right. The 2nd Amendment will never be repealed.\"\n\nIn related news, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) and Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-Fla) have introduced legislation to restrict access to ammunition. \"Our bill will require that firearms users file a form requesting permission each time they want to reload their weapons,\" Wasserman-Schultz said. \"While this wouldn't totally prevent victims from getting shot it will reduce the number of people that could be shot by each gun. If our bill had been in effect prior to Nikolas Cruz's rampage it would have been limited the number of bullets he could've fired to a single clip. He wouldn't have been able to kill 17 people.\"\n\nDNC Deputy Touts Minimum Income Idea\n\nRep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn), deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, endorsed the concept of government paying a minimum income to all citizens regardless of whether they work or not.\n\n\"A lot of things that people do don't have a market value,\" Ellison argued. \"For example, as a Muslim, I am obligated to pray five times a day, go on a pilgrimage to Mecca, and wage jihad to spread the faith. As a member of Congress I have a generous salary and a small commitment of time I have to put in to earn this salary. Others aren't so fortunate.\"\n\n\"What we need to ask ourselves is whether we, as a society, should force a person to try to support himself by taking a low skilled job if it would interfere with his other higher priority obligations,\" the Congressman posited. \"Wouldn't our lives be more meaningful if more of us were freed of the drudgery of wage slavery so we would be able to pursue these higher priorities?\"\n\n\"A guaranteed minimum income might also assuage the justifiable anger many feel at the inequitable distribution of wealth in our country,\" Ellison added. \"Ideally, everything ought to be put into a common pot and divvied out based on need. But we're not there yet intellectually or politically. The minimum income idea is a baby step toward that ideal.\"\n\nDershowitz Criticizes Mueller Probe\n\nLiberal Democrat lawyer Alan Dershowitz likened the Mueller probe into the Trump presidency to the type of legal tactics of the Soviet Union. \"First off, 'collusion' is not a crime defined in statute,\" he observed. \"On top of this, the mandate given to Robert Mueller by Rod Rosenstein is unconstrained. Essentially, Mueller has been granted an unlimited budget and an unlimited amount of time to harass Trump in search of something to charge him with. This isn't the way we want our justice system to work. It's the way Stalin's 'justice' system worked.\"\n\nDershowitz maintains that \"after a year on the job without finding evidence of any criminal activity by Trump the prosecution ought to drop the case. Signs that Mueller is now seeking to investigate Trump's finances and sexual liaisons from long before the 2016 election are clearly what judges would label a 'fishing expedition.' Not only are the statutes of limitations long expired on any alleged infractions, we're now into the 'manufactured crimes' of obstructing investigations for which there is no warrant for being undertaken.\"\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif) disagreed with Dershowitz, contending that \"sometimes existing law doesn't adequately anticipate the crimes persons may commit. If we know a person is a bad actor we shouldn't automatically preclude even the methods that may have been used by a regime that has been repeatedly sullied as a dictatorship. Remember, that 'dictatorship' was instrumental in defeating Hitler. So, clearly, that dictatorship was capable of doing the right thing even if its methods didn't match America's normal standards of justice.\"\n\nChicago Mayor Rejects Poll\n\nA recent poll indicating widespread disappointment with Mayor Rahm Emanuel's performance was rebuffed by the Mayor who vowed to \"fight to the bitter end to transform this city and make it worthy of the vision of a great and progressive society espoused by former President Obama.\"\n\nAmong the polls findings was that only 18% of respondents said they would vote to reelect him vs. 34% saying they would vote to replace him and 36% saying they would consider voting for someone else. Sixty-nine percent said lack of \"an honest or trustworthy city government\" was a major problem with the Emanuel Administration. Eighty percent said they felt less safe than they did two years ago.\n\nEmanuel's campaign spokesman Peter Giangreco dismissed the poll. \"It's from the same pollster the Mayor sent a dead fish to a few years ago,\" he reminded. \"The people of this city know that the Mayor will do whatever it takes to stay on top. He is a master at exploiting crises for political advantage. Those who challenge him do so at their own risk.\"\n\nMadison Councilwoman Objects to Armed Bank Guards\n\nAfter one of her constituents was killed while attempting to rob a bank, Madison, Wisconsin city councilwoman Amanda Hall called the shooting \"unnecessary\" and demanded \"an alternate approach. What this looks like to me is we have a young man, who didn't have the community support and the community opportunity to make a different choice with what he was going to do with his Thursday. And now he's dead.\"\n\n\"Allowing banks to deploy armed guards is a desperation measure that comes too late to achieve the best results,\" Hall contended. \"It foments an arms race between those who have money and those who need it. We could go into the question of whether any business has a moral right to use deadly force to impede the redistribution of wealth this country so urgently needs. For now, though, I'm saying that as a practical matter it would be better to ban this practice and replace it with a more humane approach.\"\n\nThis \"more humane\" approach, according to Hall, \"would entail educating and politically activating both the general public and young people to use their efforts to redistribute wealth via the political process. The fact that the bank involved in this shooting has been repeatedly robbed shouldn't be used as an excuse to arm itself. It should be taken as a sign that there are inequities in the way that those who have can callously withhold from those who have not.\"\n\nThe Councilwoman says she hopes that \"we can use this tragedy to enlist voters to opt for social justice at the polls. If the have-nots of our society can have confidence that the government will seize the assets being hoarded by the haves and redistribute them more fairly they won't have to take the individual initiative to rob banks themselves. With the law on their side the whole process would be more peaceful and just.\"\n\nAn indication that Hall's message is in tune with wider social trends is the Millennial generation's lack of saving for retirement. Only a third have expressed any interest or intent to provide for their post-work years. As one young man explained, \"capitalism will be gone by the time I'm old enough to retire. The government will control all the money. They will decide who lives and who dies. I'm just trying to have a good time while I can.\" Surveys show that half of Millenials spend more on nights out than they do on rent and devote the majority of their income on impulse purchases based on social media fads. And why not? In New York City, the deBlasio administration has budgeted more than a billion dollars to house the homeless in hotels.\n\nCensus Plan Assailed by Democrats\n\nThe US Census Bureau's plan to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census spurred an outpouring of deranged rhetoric from assorted Democrats and their allies.\n\nTom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, incorrectly portrayed the plan as an attempt to \"only count citizens\" and contended it is a \"voter suppression\" strategy. \"Combined with the Republican insistence that voters show IDs before they can cast a ballot, the citizenship question strikes at the very heart of the democratic ideal that every person\u2014citizen or not\u2014have a say in who rules over him.\"\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman vowed to lead a multi-state lawsuit aimed at stopping the added question. \"Why does the federal government need to know who is or isn't a citizen?\" he asked. \"Since a person doesn't have to be a citizen to get a driver's license, to get medical care, to go to school, or receive welfare benefits the answer to such a question serves no legitimate public purpose.\"\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra called the question \"an attack on our state's right to grant sanctuary to those in the country without permission. Once word gets around that citizenship will be questioned the undocumented immigrants will avoid census takers and not be counted. The state and the urban areas where most of the immigrants live will get fewer congressional districts and Democrats will lose votes in the House of Representatives. This both illegal and unconstitutional.\"\n\nIn related news, Utah senatorial candidate Mitt Romney kicked off his campaign with the assertion that he is tougher on immigration than President Trump. \"Trump is totally focused on keeping illegal immigrants out,\" Romney observed. \"Well, we can't win if we only play defense.
