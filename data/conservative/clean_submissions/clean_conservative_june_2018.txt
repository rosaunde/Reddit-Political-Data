My family is the stereotypical Indian family where almost all are Democrats and where every political discussion ends up with me losing because of my \"disrespectful nature\". The thing to understand is unlike other communities the Indian American community is quite the paradox in that it is highly religious with almost all of us going to the temple every week and doing poojas(prayer rituals)everyday. Indian Americans are mainly Democrats due to the nature of India and it's politics and because of the American colleges indocritinating the minds of teenagers and freshmen with liberal propoganda compunded by the fact that we are one of the most highly educated minorities in the country. The reason for the liberalism of my compatriots is because of lack of awareness and due to the Democratic party's policy of pandering to the minorities . If the conservative movement and the Republican party were to wholeheartedly try to improve their standing with the community they would find the task extremely easy given the similarity of Indian(Hindu) values with judeo-christiam values(Family values,religiousness,tolerance,family values,) the fact of the matter is the paradox is that most Indian Americans are not okay with abortion or gay rights and are some of the most conservative people in the planet however paradoxically they vote for the liberal party only because they feel threatened due to the propoganda of the Democratic party and if we were to gather them to our fold the task is not as monumental as it seems.\n\nP.S Thanks to everyone on this subreddit I feel very intrigued by the discussions that take place everyday here and this genuinely affirms the faith I had in my beliefs and America on a daily basis.\n\nGod\/Gods bless.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Why we need to do a better job of recruiting Indian- Americans to our fold."}

It happened in 1934 with the passage of the National Firearms Act. It happened in 1938 with the Gun Control Act; and again under the same name in 1968. It happened in 1986 with the Hughes Amendment. (And it happened temporarily with the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994.)\n\nWhere are the Conservatives going on the offensive? In the Courts? In the streets? In the offices of the NRA which has passively given in? Where is resistance to the tyranny of the Hughes Amendment? The ATF? The overburdensome and ridiculous regulations on \u201cmodifications\u201d? A whole class of gun has been banned and we ignore it. California, as many of you know, arrests good faith gun registers. Where are the protests? The fundraisers? \n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is I\u2019m tired of us of being complicit in the degradation of our rights. And I\u2019m not saying some of us haven\u2019t pushed back against what I\u2019ve said above. What I do think is that enough of us are not doing that. And overall, I think the Left has put us in a box of permanent defensive mode. We mustn\u2019t let that continue, lest we fall into this same trap for another generation. When we talk about gun rights on these forums, in debates, etc. let\u2019s not be boxed in by what the Left has begrudgingly allowed us. Understandably, the debate is in a certain place right now, but that shouldn\u2019t be our limit.

I\u2019ll give you some of my thoughts to get the discussion going. \n\nGovernor: let\u2019s face it, no real good Republican candidates will bother running here which is why the GOP never endorsed anyone in this race. President Trump did tweet in support of Cox, so he\u2019s probably a safe bet for at least 2nd place. But we\u2019ll likely get Moonbean 2.0 and continue running this state into the ground. \n\nSenate: same thing as the Governor race, no point in any Republicans running to take down senile Feinstein. I think it\u2019s funny the only candidate even close to her at all is some moron who\u2019s a complete Marxist apparently that accuses Feisntein of not being far enough left, which demonstrates where this state is headed. \n\nI live in the 49th Congressional District and it\u2019s a crazy race with Issa retiring. Known stalker and ex-wife harasser Applegate is probably the favorite since he did decently in his losing effort last election to Issa. I really like Brian Maryott here in this race, but Diane Harkey is another good candidate and the best chance we have of keeping this district red and not turning into a gong show. \nI don\u2019t really know a ton about other races outside my district, so I welcome all info on the other races. The only thing I can add is I met Shawn Nelson at a our College Republicans meeting and everyone really liked him, he was definitely the most engaging and impressive of all the candidates who came to speak to our club. \n\nDistrict Attourney: Rackaukus gotta go. Time for Todd Spitzer. He had a long track record of serving our community and making a difference here and think he\u2019s the man for the job. #ToddsPlan\n\nPropositions: they all seemed dumb, I didn\u2019t like any of them and think I voted NO for every single one haha. \n\nI\u2019d love to hear everyone else\u2019s thoughts on the election. \n","subreddit":"The_SAC","title":"CA Midterm Election Tomorrow""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"[deleted]","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"CA Midterm Election Tomorrow"}

From geography class, where most of my opinionated test answers were leftist trash, to gym where my teacher is anti vaxx. It's garbage. But the one incident that severely annoyed me today was a class held election. It kind of sprung up and we didn't know what was happening. We get our ballots, and I vote libertarian, I know my votes is basically useless, but I agree with their platform more than the conservative one, but ik still right leaning. That's besides the point. And I noticed that the conservative party was the lowest on the ballot. This wouldn't be a problem if only the major parties were shown, but there significantly smaller parties above like the communist party or the green party. Now what really annoyed me where when other kids where asking what they should do because they don't know anyone's platform or what they the parties even were. The teacher responded, \"oh just vote liberal then\". I'd understand if they just said vote for whoever because of time constraints or something but the teacher deliberately told them to vote for the liberal party. I don't know, our education system is so left wing and they're basically converting children. What do you guys think?","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Liberal brainwashing in Canadian schools"}

But now that I am hearing that this team, (and the more likely Warriors) aren't gonna visit the White House to see President Trump, I feel like there definitely needs to be some changes in this country, regardless of the ignorance that these players have of the actual facts. My former basketball appreciation has transformed into an anhedonia that only can be relinquished through a nationwide Trump Appreciation.\n\nI was wondering if a potential solution to the \"blacks, and other minorities, are killed more than any other race\" claim, presented by most BLM protesters, would be to implement a nationwide mandatory course that students must take in order to graduate. This course would be about confronting the police; the right tone to have, hand placements, etc.... I know that this might be coming across as \"racists or fascists\" to some people, but in terms of looking for ways to cease the protests, there are not a lot of options. But I really want to watch Basketball again, so I thought of some other ideas.\n\nPerhaps another solution would be to increase the minorities in the police force, according to *DataUSA*, white people make up around 80 &amp;#37; of the police force, while black people make up 13&amp;#37; of this force, while other minorities are even lower. Increasing the minorities in the task force could bring appeasement to the BLM organization, and it would look good for Trump. Thus the number one recruiter organizations should be the police force, especially in neighborhoods where they are predominantly minorities.\n\nAnother idea could be to disband the practice of \"car chase gun firing\". According to *the Root*, 95 people were killed in 2017 by firings from this procedure. I know you have a better chance of dying from a lightning strike, but in terms of appeasement of the left, this implementation could lead to a possible enlargement in trump popularity.\n\nLastly, cops usage of guns on people with knifes lead to the death of 170 people (The Root). Still in the grande scheme of things (A simple comparison to the deaths each year by heart Disease will scare you), this is not alarming. Thus, a potential solution might be to implement a new procedure for dealing with these situations, preferentially one without the use of a firearm.\n\nI know this might seem like a rant, and I probably will not be noticed in the slightest by anyone, but I REALLY JUST WANT TO GET BACK TO WATCHING THE NBA FINALS AGAIN!!!!\n\nSources :\n\n1.

I'll link it at the bottom\n \n&gt; I\u2019d be worried, and maybe even penitent, if I thought that \u201creverse racism\u201d\u2014that\u2019s what I stand accused of by the alt-right and their comrades among mere conservatives\u2014was in the realm of reality, where we could measure its results.\n&gt; \n&gt; But there\u2019s no such thing. **Racism is the exclusive property of white, mostly European people in this part of the world (the western hemisphere)**, because such people were able to impose their will on 9 million Africans via a labor system called slavery, and benefit from the economic and social capital of that system unto this day\u2014regardless of their class standing, then or now. That is why the case for reparations is so compelling.\n&gt; \n&gt; Racism is about power. Do you have unseen and unspoken power over others merely because you were born a white boy and they weren\u2019t? Ask yourself, and be honest about it. OK, it\u2019s a rhetorical question with a built-in answer. Of course you do. Unless you\u2019ve been totally inattentive, you know that as you became a white man, and this without thinking it through, you knew that your choices\u2014about anything\u2014were more various than the females among you, and much greater than those available to people of color, male or female. Why?\n&gt; \n&gt; **Put it this way. Black people can hate white people, but you can\u2019t call them racists** unless they have power over you, and not just over you but your people, those white people you call your own. Have black people ever been able to enslave you, degrade you, confine you, define you, as the consequence of your phenotype, as white people have done for centuries in oppressing, employing, excluding, and representing black folk?\n&gt; \n&gt; If your answer is No, then, give up on calling me a racist. Be white if you like, just don\u2019t project the image and the idea of oppression onto yourself as a function of your whiteness, because if you do, I can, with good reason, call you a sniveling, punkass moron.\n\nCan't believe this guy is a professor at a public university.

I've gone through an ideological transformation the last few years, and have found myself more and more in line with the beliefs of the conservative movement; I simply cannot belong to a party (or group of people) who are so delusional (hating white people, forcing transgenderism on children, etc). \n\nThat said, I have noticed some of my more \"liberal\" stances to have not wavered: I'm pro choice, I'm completely in favor of same sex marriage, and I really enjoy smoking pot; I don't see how the federal government has any say in any of these things. Does harboring these beliefs make me a phony? Would you still consider me on your side?\n\nI know more and more people like myself, who are making the jump from left to right.

Please accept my preemptive apologies if such blatant self-promotion is against one of the rules.*\n\n[https:\/\/thecornersoapbox.weebly.com\/blog\/archives\/03-2018](https:\/\/thecornersoapbox.weebly.com\/blog\/archives\/03-2018)\n\nI went to a conservative  Christian high school. \u00a0Most of my friends from high school are  Christian. \u00a0It may surprise you to learn that many of them are liberal  Democrats or Democrat sympathizers, though if you yourself went to a  Christian high school this may not surprise you at all.\n\nIt\u2019s  no secret that many Americans who claim to be Christian are liberal  Democrats. \u00a0But I mention the phenomenon of graduates from Christian  high schools being (often becoming sometime during their senior year if  my suspicions and experience are any indication) openly liberal to  highlight the known fact that even conservative Christian institutions  are producing, attracting, and harboring liberal activists.\n\nI  say \u201cliberal activists\u201d because, in my generation at least, there is no  other type of liberal. Donald Trump\u2019s election has resulted in what few  of them were not openly political effectively being conscripted into  The Resistance. \u00a0Most of those millennial liberals who went to my high  school are not as extreme as the stereotypical college feminist. They  don\u2019t talk about \u201csafe spaces\u201d, they don\u2019t sympathize with Antifa (at  least not openly), and most will be careful not to be seen defending  Planned Parenthood too loudly. \u00a0Their activism is mostly restricted to  Facebook, just like most activism from liberals and conservatives alike  seems to be restricted to Facebook.\n\nBut  being friends on Facebook is enough to know which side they have  picked. \u00a0And as moderate as they may try to appear, they have picked a  side. A few shared memes, liked posts, etc. communicate that they are  members of The Resistance, even if they are only part of the reserve  force.\n\nI have  also been able to intuit what they tend to think of the group comprised  of me and the other students from my high school who chose to remain,  or even become, conservative Christians. \u00a0Now I want to make it clear  that none of these liberal classmates have ever individually  disrespected or mistreated me, and I have good relationships with most  of them. But as a whole, they view us as relatively intelligent peers  who have simply not been fortunate enough to break away from the mental  shackles imposed on us by our church denomination through our parents  and the conservative faculty at our high school. I could picture their  collective advice to us being something like \u201cDr. Peterson (made up name  of our Dean of Students) isn\u2019t here anymore to fine you for not wearing  a belt. \u00a0You need to take some of what they taught us at that school  with a grain of salt.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s  not to say I think all of them necessarily thought the strict dress  code at our school was a bad thing, but the point is that our high  school was very conservative, had its share of nonsense and bullshit  from the administration, and in general they are kind of glad to be away  from it. \u00a0Well, I know for a fact that I and several other of my  conservative peers are glad to be away from that place as well, but  liberal millennials tend to view themselves as supporting characters in a  real-life dystopian story, and it is clear that these liberal graduates  view our Alma Mater as being beholden to the conservative dystopia that  is currently headed but not entirely controlled by Donald Trump. \u00a0And  as for their classmates who also remain beholden to this dystopia, we\u2019re  kind of like that kid in the terrible movie *Dead Poets Society*  who ratted out the Society to the school administration and got Mr.  Keating fired, not because he really wanted to but simply because the  agents of the dystopia convinced him that it was the right thing against  his better judgement. \u00a0They, on the other hand, are standing on their  desks, and they are trying to convince us that it\u2019s alright to do so.\n\nThis  dynamic is not unique to alumni from Christian high schools. \u00a0It is the  same attitude with which many of the more \u201cmoderate\u201d liberals of all  age groups regard their conservative friends. \u00a0It\u2019s not that we\u2019re bad  people, it\u2019s just that we don\u2019t get it. It is the same attitude conveyed  a little more condescendingly in articles like [this](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/inspired-life\/wp\/2017\/11\/22\/at-yale-we-conducted-an-experiment-to-turn-conservatives-into-liberals-the-results-say-a-lot-about-our-political-divisions\/?utm_term=.c06fcdb34aa5),  which explains a study that purports to demonstrate that being a  steadfast conservative is often reducible to having stronger primal  self-preservation instincts than liberals. \u00a0If you want to drop the  clinical facade and judge the article as the propaganda piece that it  clearly is, what the author is really saying is that conservatives in  middle America, by and large, are at best the unfortunate victims of  repressed mild emotional trauma from our parents never letting us leave  the house alone until age 13 for fear of kidnapping, and at worst  atavists whose genetically predetermined responses to stimuli are more  fitting for societies of a more, ahem, simple state  of development. \u00a0But don\u2019t worry, society needs folks who possess such  mindstates as well, after all the root of such attitudes is a healthy  drive for safety and prudence (wink wink).\n\nYou  see the liberals in my friend circles, especially liberal Christians  who went to my high school, like to share articles like this on social  media. \u00a0They will also, without directly addressing us conservative  peers, delineate on how such findings relate to the rise of Nazism and  other hyper-nationalist movements in a manner that they no doubt think  is erudite.\n\nFirst  of all, as a quick aside, I\u2019d like to address this narrative of the  rise of Nazism. \u00a0Someone needs to point out that while the ability to  regurgitate this tired thesis that Hitler was able to rise to power by  manipulating people\u2019s primal urges in a population that was starving and  war-traumatized, by giving them an internal enemy (the Jews) to project  their fear and bitterness onto, and by promising them a better life  while not telling them very much about the uglier side of his agenda  until they had been fully initiated, on an essay exam may have impressed  your AP World History teacher, it is at best an oversimplification of  history and at worst disingenuous. \u00a0Germany in the 1930s was not just a  country of poor farmers and unemployed Great War veterans who simply let  themselves be led down Hitler\u2019s path to hell before they realized their  mistake. The fact of the matter is that Weimar Germany was already a  society of people who by and large did not value freedom and democracy  and which already suffered from widespread moral bankruptcy before  Hitler became prominent. Hitler did not recruit the Brownshirts by  inviting young men with no future to be part of something greater than  themselves so much as he simply organized and militarized the criminal  element of several major cities to serve his purposes. \u00a0The Germans had  to be carpet-bombed and then occupied before they were ready to finally  be a part of the civilized West. And any attempt to connect the  narrative of the Nazis to the rise of Trump is, you know, stupid.\n\nBut  anyway, getting back to the point, I\u2019m focusing on my liberal peers  from Christian high schools across the nation because I know that we,  conservative millennial Christians, will have to deal with them in the  not-so-distant future. \u00a0My liberal classmates may not have much respect  for the conservative traditions of our school, but they will likely  comprise a large share of the school\u2019s future teachers, staff, PTO  leaders, Alumni Association officers, and major donors. \u00a0And that\u2019s a  problem. We know where their loyalties lie, and it is with the  Democratic Party first and Christ and His church second. You cannot be a  loyal Democrat and have those priorities reversed. These people will be  leaven within the church\u2019s institutions. \u00a0[We\u2019ve seen what their so-called \u201cmoderate\u201d liberal parents from the Boomer generation can do to such institutions](http:\/\/thefederalist.com\/2016\/09\/14\/8-steps-catholic-church-take-approve-gay-marriage-like-tim-kaine-expects\/)  simply by being tolerated within them even if most of them don\u2019t go out  of their way to be liberal activists. And they will be active soldiers  in the war against conservatism and Christianity, whether they know it  or not.\n\nAnd  so I\u2019d like to address the remainder of this piece to those people. \u00a0Not  just my liberal classmates, but all moderate liberal Christians of my  generation (hereafter \u201cyou\u201d):You  have picked a side, and it is the wrong one. \u00a0You think that we  conservative millennial Christians (hereafter \u201cwe\u201d) are on the \u201cwrong  side of history\u201d, but it is actually you who have chosen the wrong side.  \u00a0You may very well have chosen the *winning* side,  but your side remains objectively, morally wrong (alternative title for  this piece: Some Things Young Conservative Christians Wish We Could Say  To Our Liberal Christian Friends If You Guys Would Hear Us Out).\n\nWe  can still be friends. \u00a0We have remained friends with you even after you  have indirectly called us homophobes, fundamentalists, reactionaries,  woman-haters, and the like. \u00a0Many of you have not directly addressed us  so to our faces, but we happen to fall into the group of people whom you  regard as such. Nevertheless, we remain your friends.\n\nBut  you need to realize that we have also chosen a side, and it is  decidedly against everything you stand for. \u00a0That does not mean we stand  against justice, fairness, charity, and the like. It\u2019s just that those  are the things you claim to  stand for, and I am speaking of the things that you are actually  willing to stand for. \u00a0When the chips are down, you will stand for the  evil of abortion. You will stand for middle school students being forced  to share shower facilities with members of the opposite sex, including  adults. \u00a0You will stand for police officers being railroaded by the  media and the justice system for doing their job in cases where a young  black man happens to end up dead.\n\nAnd  you will stand for the persecution of Christians. \u00a0Specifically, you  will stand for the persecution of Christians who have not thrown their  lot in with the American persecutors of Christians, which means  eventually that you will stand for the persecution of us.\n\nFor  example, whenever you guys rail against a certain Christian artist or  business owner for not accommodating a same-sex couple or someone who  identifies as transgender, it never seems to occur to you that your  Christian friends on the other side of the political aisle could and  probably will be in that same position in the future. \u00a0We are afraid to  open our own businesses or go into creative professions because we know  that the minute we cross the LGBT agenda, or possibly the abortion  agenda, we are liable to have our lives destroyed by the government.\n\nAnd  you support this. \u00a0You will side with the government when they come to  take our businesses away from us or even impose criminal sanctions.  \u00a0Perhaps you will reason that it is regrettable but necessary, and that  it\u2019s our own fault in the end for resisting civil rights.\n\nYou  know, I\u2019m not going to go as far as to pull out the \u201cif you\u2019re a  liberal Christian then you\u2019re not really a Christian\u201d card here, but  Jesus does have some strong words of warning for those who persistently  side with the world over Him. \u00a0We all side with the world over Him, and  we all do so often. Even the Apostles did. But you have formally chosen a  side, declared it, and it happens to be the side that is waging war  against Christ and His Church.Your  excuses that you would actually be furthering Christ\u2019s love are totally  hollow. \u00a0Jesus would not have baked a cake for a gay \u201cwedding\u201d (or  built a gay couple a house to live in, being a carpenter), he would not  (does not) support Planned Parenthood, and he would not (does not)  support the gender transition process. \u00a0If you disagree with this, you  are disagreeing with Him, the Apostle Paul, not to mention the Church  Fathers along with every serious prominent theologian throughout the  history of Christianity until the past three or four decades. Of course,  the church fathers never spoke about transgenderism, but that\u2019s only  because it is an insane demonic dystopian agenda that even the ancient  pagans could hardly have conceived. \u00a0They did speak on abortion and gay  marriage, and their opinions on the matter hold a lot more weight than  yours. Ecumenically speaking, the scholarship on these matters, along  with evolution and some other things, within Christianity is as settled  as you claim the scholarship is on climate change. The denominations and  clerics that claim otherwise do so ashamedly and uneasily, and can  accurately be described as \u201cBible deniers\u201d. \u00a0And don\u2019t try to bring lame  arguments regarding shellfish and eating pork into this, because [those arguments have been quite thoroughly debunked](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4r2m_cffRjI&amp;t=7s),  and if you haven\u2019t heard the debunking it\u2019s only because members of  your side ban us from the message boards (one of the things that annoy  us about debating with you liberal Christians is that, while you guys  are generally more willing to at least debate us in the first place than  your more extreme SJW allies, many of you have a tendency to need to  have very basic theological concepts explained to you as if you've never  heard them before.\u00a0 It makes it difficult for the discussion to  progress when we constantly have to stop and do your liberal pastor's  job for him.)\n\nOf  course, I wouldn\u2019t expect that to hold much weight with atheists and  hardcore secularists who don\u2019t believe the Bible to have any authority  anyway. \u00a0They have chosen their side, and they are proud of it. But at  least they won\u2019t be attending a Christian college claiming to want an  authentic Christian education and then working to tear down  Christianity within that institution.\n\nYour  Christian brothers and sisters are being persecuted by the side you  have chosen, and you will be required to assent to and sometimes  participate in the persecution in order to be a loyal member of your  Resistance. \u00a0Although the gap may be closing, you are still the  out-group within American Christianity, and yet you demand equal  (greater) say and status. You call our kind Pharisees while enabling our  persecution at the hands of the side you have chosen. \u00a0You have gone  out of your way to declare yourselves \u201callies\u201d to every group from gays  to transgenders to feminists to Muslims, but we never seem to part of  your alliance. Not that we would want to, because you\u2019re allied with  enemy powers.\n\nYou  see, we don\u2019t disagree with you because we are more afraid or less  college-educated or whatever else you have in mind. \u00a0We disagree with  you because the Bible is on our side, the facts are on our side, common  sense are on our side, and moral principles are on our side, and not  yours. \u00a0We showed you footage of Planned Parenthood trafficking in baby  parts, and you ignored it. You might be a little uncomfortable with it,  but you would never be as vocally outraged as when a police officer  shoots a black person and it gets the attention of the national media,  despite the fact that in almost every single case your side has been  objectively and completely wrong about both the facts and the law of the  matter.\n\nThis  is the point where many of you decide to pull out the \u201cpersonally  opposed\u201d card. Mainly, you will use this card in the abortion debate,  since you have long ago given up pretending to be \u201cpersonally opposed\u201d  to gay marriage (although you might be one of the few left who will  admit the inability to defend gay \u201cmarriage\u201d on Biblical grounds but  simply sidestep the issue by repeating the lie that the Constitution  requires the government to recognize it even though it does no such  thing, which is to say you think that the despot Supreme Court has  absolved you of having to make any further defense of this abomination  to others or to your own conscience) or gender conversion. Conveniently,  you have already passed the point of having to worry about being a  scared freshman girl who now has to share a locker room with a boy. And  come to think of it, you\u2019ve also conveniently passed the point of having  to worry about being aborted. I\u2019d just like to point out that your  sudden \u201cpersonally opposed\u201d fig leaf when it comes to especially morally  uncomfortable topics like abortion kind of clashes with your persona as  a fighter for justice in the face of dystopia.\n\nOf  course you don\u2019t have to use that card often, because compared to your  more extreme, non-Christian contemporaries, most of the political talk  we hear from you centers around the somewhat less controversial topics  like gun control, immigration, environmentalism, welfare, etc. \u00a0Much of  what you have to say concerns how \u201cuncaring\u201d our side is more than it  does any actual evidence, but at least you could hold the Democrat  positions on such issues and still theoretically be a member in good  standing of Christian orthodoxy. These are issues that the Bible does  not give explicit guidance on like abortion and gay \u201cmarriage\u201d. \u00a0But  there are still two main problems with you siding with Democrats on  these issues. The first is that in most cases your opinions are wrong,  often unconstitutional, and easily debunked. But more importantly for  your case specifically, even your stances on these issues and the way  you argue them betray a mentality that is fundamentally at odds with  traditional Christianity. \u00a0For example, when you argue that the New  Testament commands us to accept waves of refugees from Islamic nations,  or to expand the welfare state, or raise the minimum wage, or whatever  else you think is \u201ccaring\u201d, claiming that \u201cJesus would want it\u201d, you are  twisting His words and putting your own words in His mouth, you know,  like how you claim we are doing whenever we articulate what the Bible  clearly says about homosexuality. \u00a0Twisting the words of the Bible to  make them say something they do not and advance an agenda that is not  Biblical is called heresy. Heresy is not something people who have  chosen the side of God should be comfortable with. The Bible leaves room  for Christians to disagree on the worldly, practical merits of things  like welfare, immigration policy, and gun control. It does not leave  room for you to make Jesus the champion of causes he never took up,  especially since there is no reason to believe Jesus would take up a  political cause despite most of the evidence being clearly against it.\n\nWhat\u2019s  more, your championing of such lesser causes is often used as a fig  leaf to deflect from your moral cowardice concerning bigger issues like  abortion and homosexuality. \u00a0You know you can\u2019t win a serious  theological argument about those issues, so you, like the Pharisees,  make a show of how \u201ccaring\u201d you are for others, [mostly by making arguments that have no factual basis and usually require someone else to do the \u201ccaring\u201d for you](https:\/\/www.dailywire.com\/news\/24284\/tax-matt-walsh).  \u00a0And in so doing, you show signs of where your loyalties lie. When you  got angry about Harambe being shot, you betrayed your anti-life colors,  because many of your arguments boiled down to the implication that the  kid somehow deserved to be mauled by a gorilla or at least that the  gorilla had an equal right not to be shot as the human child had to not  be mauled at the zoo. \u00a0When you defended Michael Brown and said his  death was a murder [in bold spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary](https:\/\/themattwalshblog.com\/hey-freguson-protestors-justice-done-never-wanted-justice\/),  you betrayed your warped sense of justice or general disdain for true  justice. Whenever you demand that the welfare state be expanded or  advocate socialism, you ignore the evidence reagarding the welfare state  and socialism. Ignoring the evidence regarding such issues does not  automatically reveal that you harbor anti-Christian values, but it does  indicate that you care more about your public image than you do about  the lives and families that have been destroyed by the welfare state and  socialism, especially when you ignore the historical link between the  abortion agenda and the welfare state and population control and  socialism (or environmentalism).\n\nAnd when you protest against the Trump administration for wanting to favor Christian refugees from Islamic countries [despite that making every kind of humanitarian sense](https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/contributions\/youre-not-a-bad-christian-just-because-you-want-to-be-cautious-about-syrian-refugees)  while simultaneously demanding that millions of unchecked Muslim men be  let in and allowed to stay indefinitely, one has to wonder: whose side  are you on?\n\nAnd  if most of what I have said does not actually describe you, if you  actually are appalled by abortion, would defend my rights as a business  owner if I were ever targeted by a vindictive gay couple, if you are  willing to take an evidence-based or at least moderate and balanced  approach to immigration and environmental regulations, and you don\u2019t  want to put cops in prison for doing their sworn duty, then one has to  ask: why have sided with the American left?\n\nNote:  \u00a0\u201cTrump scares me\u201d is not a good reason. \u00a0I was a firm \u201cNever Trump\u201d  conservative in 2016, and did not vote for him. \u00a0That didn\u2019t cause me to  throw my lot in with the party that wants to force me to fund Planned  Parenthood.\n\nAnd one more thing: your more extreme secularist liberal friends that have gone full-SJW are not impressed with you.  They aren't impressed with your virtue-signaling, they aren't impressed with the constant apologies you make for us, they aren't impressed with your attempts to prove yourselves as \\[the Christians that are cool and will respect you\\]([http:\/\/thefederalist.com\/2015\/12\/02\/an-other-christian-responds-to-buzzfeeds-questions-christians-have-for-other-christians\/](http:\/\/thefederalist.com\/2015\/12\/02\/an-other-christian-responds-to-buzzfeeds-questions-christians-have-for-other-christians\/)) while treating us like an uncle who sometimes says racist things at Thanksgiving dinners but whom you love anyway.  To them, you're still in the same group of square losers as us, it's just that they may think there is a little more hope for you.\n\nI  realize my words so far have been harsh, but they could be a lot  harsher. \u00a0I don\u2019t want to burn bridges with my friends on the other side  of the aisle, and I certainly don't think every cause they take up is  completely without merit (for example, I do think conservatives have  railed just a little too hard on the #MeToo thing, wrought with  hypocrisy though the movement has been). But I\u2019m writing this piece  because, frankly, things are going to have to come to a head between our  two sides. \u00a0Your side has engaged an unrelenting campaign of attacks  and persecution against those of us who have remained faithful to  Christian orthodoxy for the past two or three decades at least, and we,  orthodox Christian conservative millennials, are not going to defer  responsive action against the agents of those who seek to destroy the  church indefinitely, even if those agents include our friends. So when  you take up teaching positions at Christian institutions only to reveal  your sympathies with the militant LGBT movement, we are going to have to  move to get you fired. When you start advocating the leftist social  agenda within the church itself, we are going to excommunicate you. When  your church is caught harboring illegal immigrants in brazen defiance  of the Biblical command to submit to the civil authorities, we\u2019re going  to speak against your church and possibly work with the government to  root them out. \u00a0The Democrats and the liberal establishment have  declared total war on conservatives and the Christian Church in  particular. We are under no obligation to sit back passively and take it  all the time.\n\nSo with that in mind, I ask one more time: \u00a0whose side are you on?","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Dear \"Moderate\" Liberal Christian Millennials: It's Time to Pick a Side"}

In my country, Iraq, you cannot convert, or else you can get killed. Your religion is printer on your ID the moment you are born, and your family will kill you if you ever tried to change religion for anyone who is living in this area, not necessarily a Muslim, because that has became the norm, and you don't listen to that happening everyday because people are so scared of this punishment.  \nWant to see some footage?

We are one step closer of killing all non-heterosexual people, and that happened when ISIS controlled cities in Iraq and Syria, you know why? because extremists keep records of all non-heterosexual people, so that they are going to be killed the moment a state or a government fails in an Islamic country.  \nFor God's Sake, Dating in Islamic society is a taboo, not that affects hundreds of million of people, who's issue is this? isn't this the issue of people who are supposedly intellectuals and all about everybody's rights?  \nWhere are liberals from this?

Here across the border comes a man, woman, and 13 year old girl.  You pick them up, the man and woman say, \"\u00a1O dios mio, mi hija!\"\n\nSo what do you do?  What can you do?\n\n* Option 1: Let them go, they're a family!  Also it's racist to ask them for any identification.\n\n* Option 2: Separate them, question them individually, verify what you can with the consulate and\/or sponsors in the U.S., make best decision from there.\n\nOption 2 sounds like a winner if you have something between your ears.  Also, you have to realize that there exists evil in this world!  Who's to say that these \"parents\" aren't human traffickers moving around sex slave(s)?  \n\nSo what can you do with the minor?  Put them in holding with the adults?  We don't have family detention centers here in the U.S., but what *do* we have?  \n\n&gt;[Reno Vs. Flores](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Reno_v._Flores)\n\n\nAh right!  Kids get raped when placed into holding cells with adults!  So the kids, by law, need to have their own holding area **and have needed to since 1993**.  Who's going to take these kids?  Well, Department of Health and Human Services took the job, passed it to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, who, in short, asked for help.  They got it from NPOs (like [Southwest Key](http:\/\/www.swkey.org\/), recently featured all over the news).\n\nLook, people come to this country for many great reasons.  Many come for terrible reasons.  Many also come for evil reasons.  Stop thinking that everyone coming to the country with good intentions.  There are many who aren't, and you can only guess *why* those who do so **illegally** are doing what they do.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"They're tearing families apart!"}

We can't passively allow manipulators to take control of platforms that will only allow them to continue spreading like a cancer throughout society, letting any creative outlet be used to spread dumb, harmful lies and surrendering more cultural influence the infiltrators haven't earned or achieved transparently.

Right now the media is in the outrage business and has a large group of addicts to serve.

{"author":"molon-labe7","created_utc":1529611626,"num_comments":75,"score":178,"selftext":"During the election I was NeverTrump.  I personally didn't like his rhetoric, I thought it was terrible when he made fun of the disabled reporter and I didn't think he was conservative.  This was largely because he was untested (other than business), heavily pushed things like tariffs, and at times said not conservative things.  I was a Cruz\/Rand person.  I refused to vote for Hillary because she was overwhelmingly worse than Trump.  Once the election was over, NeverTrump ceased to exist.  I want the best for the country and I wanted Trump to be wildly successful.  I am a person who sees the Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Federalist papers as some of the greatest documents in western philosophy ever written.  They are full of concepts and ideas made by people who knew what it was like to deal with tyranny and wanted to make a document to protect the citizens from the same tyranny they dealt with, in addition to making a great experiment of true freedom.  Even if Trump hasn't read these things, all I wanted was the best for my country, whether or not I agreed with Trump or voted for him.\n\nThis all being said, I no longer believe that Trump is a threat to our country.  I never really believed that he was, more that he may poison what it means to be a conservative.  In addition to this, I did see the left as the danger, but I believe I massively underestimated what the left was willing to do and the malice with which they hate anyone who doesn't believe how they do.  The day after the election, I had classmates who were \"praying that Trump and Pence got heart attacks and died\".  Worse than that, I personally was afraid because of the climate of my campus that I would be found out for being somewhere between a conservative and libertarian and would either be ostracized by my peers or even worse, physically assaulted.  The protests were so active and \"Trump Derangement Syndrome\" was fervent that I was at one point considering packing a go-bag and leave campus.  Luckily I didn't have to do so.  Since the election, I have only seen things get worse.  While there haven't been any assaults of people wearing MAGA hats, Conservatives were demonized and shouted down.  I was very satisfied just allowing myself to finish my degree and get the hell out of here.  I met a few conservatives in prospective student meetings and would warn them about what it was like for people who weren't full marxist\/sjw.  I was happy to do so because I didn't want any of my fellow conservatives dealing with what I had to deal with. As things have progressed, rhetoric has gotten significantly worse.  No longer are we called \"deplorables\" something even I was angered at because even though I didn't vote for Trump, I was angry that they were calling my parents, neighbors from my hometown, friends and family that, but now we are being called \"Sub-human\" (I will refer people to Senator Cruz being asked to provide proof that he was a human). \n\nAt this point I can no longer think that \\*anyone\\* on the Right is a threat to our democracy, country, or culture.  Trump has been legislating as one of the most Conservative in history, at least as far as I can tell currently.  I wouldn't just be happy to vote for Trump, I would be probably be working on his campaign, even with all of the bad things he has done in his personal life.  I now see that the Left is the greatest threat to our democracy.  Not only do they want to eliminate everything that makes us American, but they truly and deeply despise everyone who does love America.  I have been trying for over a year to understand the Left.  I cannot any longer.  I am fully willing to help heal this country, so long as the left is willing to as well.  Until then, no compromise can be or should be made.  Even if they are willing to help heal the divide in the country, we cannot concede any of our freedoms for their fascist, all consuming ideology.  Not even in the face of Armageddon. Never compromise.\n\nI really don't know why I made this post.  I just wanted to let some of you know what the thoughts were of a recent, millennial graduate student thinks of this whole situation.  We are not all liberals.  Some of us have been push far to the right because of the left.  I know I have.  I'm sure I am not alone.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I was a NeverTrumper during the election. I'd be happy to vote for him now"}

One such claim is that the feds have no authority to determine immigration policy; it is a state issue. They believe CA can admit people on whatever terms it wishes. This issue surfaced repeatedly during the debate on Trump\u2019s travel ban policy.\n\nLet me clear this up. Art 1, \u00a78, cl 3 of the U.S. Const expressly gives Congress the power to \u201cEstablish an uniform Rule on Naturalization.\u201d This power is not exercised co-tremendously with the states. It is exclusive to Congress or there would be no \u201cuniform rule.\u201d Under the (pre-constitution) Articles of Confederation, each state had the authority to admit foreigners on its own terms. This created a condition which the great Joseph Story called \u201cmischievous in its nature.\u201d Story\u2019s Commentaries, \u00a71103. Hence, the power was delegated exclusively to Congress. Why? As Story remarks, \u201cIt is of the deepest interest to the whole union to know who are entitled to enjoy the rights of citizens in each state, since they thereby, in effect, become entitled to the rights of citizens in all the states.\n\nIf aliens might be admitted indiscriminately to enjoy all the rights of citizens at the will of a single state, the union might itself be endangered by an influx of foreigners, hostile to its institutions, ignorant of its powers, and incapable of a due establishment of its privileges.\u201d It should be noted that of all the discord that existed during the constitutional convention, there is no dissonance on this issue. It is sad to see the profound ignorance in America today.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Misinformation used to whip the pubic into an emotional frenzy....."}

Our ancestors were massacred by the ottomans, and yet to this day it is denied an not recognized. Did we all make a \u201cPromise\u201d to never forget\u2026yes we did. But the world refuses to remember our losses, our tears.\n\nNow fast forward to the Bolshevik revolution, many Armenians fled into what was at that time Russia. They worked hard, had families, acquired homes \u2026. Only to have it all taken away. How you ask\u2026Imagine you are a young child, when your home is suddenly invaded by a number of people with covered faces and weapons. Now imagine they storm your house, go upstairs. You hear screaming, you run to the stairs to see your mother being thrown down by one of those men\u2026 As you are crying and trying to help your mother\u2026those men come down the stairs and declare that everything in the home now belongs to the people. As a child you don\u2019t understand, and you scream at them only to be told \u2026 you are not sharing your wealth and that you and your family must now give it all up. So, you must now start all over. You grow up working at a young age, get married, work long hours into the night sewing and doing what you must to feed your young son and dream of leaving. Husband now has left and somehow you manage to save up enough money to take your child and smuggle out of the country. Where to \u2026 IRAN.\n\nThe son now grown, and in the Shahs military meets his future wife, they get married and halve a little girl. Tensions in Iran, even in the 50\u2019s was high. The Shah was westernizing the county too fast. Mom worked at the American embassy and could see the turmoil happening. Two years after the birth of their daughter, she is now pregnant again \u2026 \u201cI will not have another child born in this country\u201d she says. So, with nothing but the cloths on their back, a 2 year old child, a pregnant wife, a grandmother from Russia half blind needing surgery and the mothers sister \u2026 they secure passage to a land that they had only dreamed of in hopes of starting fresh and above all else \u2026 FREE.\n\nI am now 2 years old, playing on the bridge of this ship when I suddenly see that everyone is screaming, cheering and crying \u2026. I run to my mother and father. \u201cWhy is everyone so sad\u201d I asked. My father looked at me, picked me up and pointed to this grand statue in the water. He pointed to it and said \u2026 \u201cWe are not sad my angel, we are happy.\u201d Why I asked. \u201cBecause we are now truly free, and no one can ever hurt us again.\u201d\n\nHonestly, as a child I did not understand. I did not understand why we had to live with our relatives, why my father was going to school every night and working all day. Why my grandmother so old, had to go to night school to learn English. I did not understand until 6 years later when my parents came back from a trip they took that day with big smiles on their faces and said, \u201cWE ARE NOW CITIZENS OF THE USA!\u201d\n\nThen came the 70\u2019s, my great aunt and aunt were here on a visit from Iran when they got a call from their neighbor. \u201cYou have to come back home, or they will take it all\u201d. We begged them not to go, my father said he will help them to become citizens, but as Armenians they should not go back. But \u2026 they did\u2026 What did they go \u201chome\u201d to\u2026 They took their home, they fired them from their jobs, they closed the Armenian schools, they destroyed our churches \u2026 We never saw them again!\n\nMy fathers cousins came to visit from the USSR. I remember taking them to a grocery store\u2026you know \u2026something we do every week and don\u2019t even think about. My father and I were half way down the first isle when we realized they were not with us.  We went back to the door\u2026they were standing there in tears. \u201cyou can just walk in and get whatever you want?\u201d they asked. It was then that I realized what a shock this must have been to them. \u201cThe shelves are all full, nothing is rationed \u2026 is this the way it is all over this country?\u201d My father now had tears in his eyes as he put his arm around them and said \u201cthis is what capitalism is, this is how we live and its not just food\u2026it anything as long as you can afford it.\u201d I did not expect their next words \u2026 \u201cThey have lied to us our entire lives! How can we go back now knowing what we do?\u201d They did not \u2026 My father helped them to become citizens!\n\nI am not the only one with a story like this one. Many have similar stories. Many have suffered through history. And many like us have learned from our own history. I was a \u201cdreamer\u201d and so were my parents. They ensured that I would be able to follow my dreams by coming to a country that some only dream of and others have been blinded to believe is evil.\n\nDo we have problems in this country\u2026 yes. Have I agreed with all its policies \u2026 no. But there is one thing I will always be grateful for \u2026 that my parents made the decision to come to a land like no other on this earth!\n\nHow does THIS immigrant child feel about this land \u2026 It is my home, it is my life\u2026and I will die to ensure that it never becomes the land that my ancestors, my parents and I fled\u2026 GOD TRULY BLESSED THE USA.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Why America..."}

It came as no surprise to me that the media, which has been proven to work in coordination with the Democratic Party, has only offered Democratic insight into the latest fracas involving illegal immigration. I've watched as they concietedly derided Trump, and assigned blame to him for the separation of families, and I've seen them embrace the contrivance that this policy is an attempt to demoralize and subjugate the Latin people.    \n   \nThe majority of Americans consume this media, and through the media's lies of omission, those Americans have no inkling of the facts surrounding this complex situation. The family separation policy was enacted in 1996, upheld by the liberal Ninth Circuit, and used promiscuously by all administrations previous - because it makes sense.   \n    \nThe majority of children arriving at the Border do so without their parents, and arriving at the Border is a treacherous feat in itself. Cartels have employed human traffickers to smuggle children to the Border, and some Cartels have even slain groups of children arriving at the Border as a message to competing Cartels.    \n     \nPoor record keeping and the prevalence of fraud has made it difficult to determine whether the adults arriving with children are indeed parents, and out of concern for the children, the adults and children have been separated.  \n     \nA plurality of women and girls making the voyage have been raped by adults accompanying them.  \n     \nAccording to the media, Trump is sending toddlers to concentration camps as retribution against Hispanics. That is some of the terminology that has actually been used. This has been compared to the Holocaust. Democratic politicians know the truth, but they and the media have pushed that narrative; and all it serves is to alienate you, the conservative constituents. It has led millions of Americans into believing that if you support Donald Trump, you, personally, are complicit in his Hiterlian vendetta against Hispanics. Since the media and the politicians promote this dire assessment, it is now considered morally right by some Democratic voters to attack you, to stop the rise of the Fourth Reich.  \n     \nAnd you will have nothing to say in your defense, because the facts of this matter are not cohesive with the divergent reality that the monolithic media has inspired. Your opinions do not have prestige, so they have no credence.

Almost everything has been politicized and there doesn't seem anyway to escape it. Football, movies, even many video games just seem to be driving it down my throat\n. \nSo FINE I'll get involved. The problem is if you at any point question the modern day democratic dogma you're (insert label here). If you agree with a republican on ANYTHING you're (insert label here). racist, homophobe, Russian, bot, misogynist, nazi etc. The democrats have nothing anymore except ad-hominem attacks with no substance. So why should I vote for them? let's look.\n\n1) The Economy - sluggish under obama and accelerating under trump. It's really a night and day difference and can't be argued. Why would I want to change this?\n\n2) foreign policy - I don't even know where democrats stand here they seem to flip flop every 3 minutes. I thought we both agreed the iraq war was a costly disaster then they go and meddle in libya and syria. More recently they were criticized trump for tough rhetoric against north korea and criticized trump for trying to make peace with north korea. Uh What?\n\n3) social issues - I support individual rights to do what they want. Republicans got a lot of flack here before and I think for good reason. A decade ago republicans were bogged down with homosexual and abortion rights issues and I think it cost them a lot of votes in the past. It seems to me these issues have been more or less resolved and the democrats are beating a dead horse.\n\n4) gun rights -   There needs to be limits afterall you can't have an ICBM right? They just can't seem to agree on where the line is drawn and it seems over time they keep inching towards killing the 2nd amendment. I used to agree with an assault weapon ban but their definition of \"assault weapon\" seems to be anything that isn't a musket.\n\n5) health care - the affordable care act was a disaster what more needs to be said. It promised a lot and delivered little. \n\n6) immigration - i thought we all agreed here that illegal immigration was an issue but something changed.I fully remember many democrats, including obama and the clintons, saying they need to be deported. \n\n7) free speech - THIS IS MY MAIN ISSUE. The democrats don't believe in this anymore. If you dissent you win firings, harrassment, and threats. I've long been critical about christianity and was welcomed with open arms. The second I criticize Islam though i'm ostracized. There's a clear double standard here. It's either all ok to criticize or none of it is. \n\n8) The russian investigation - Every new revelation makes the democrats look worse and worse. Nothing in the mueller investigation holds up to scrutiny. If you only read the headlines you get a false narrative which is what the russian investigation ultimately is. EVEN IF IT IS TRUE the problem is it was investigated horrendously and you can't get past the fruit of the poisonous tree problem. \n\nIt's clear to me that their only platform in the midterms is to impeach trump. The result is I went from being an independent who never cared to a registered republican die hard trump supporter voting in the midterms for the first time. Trump has had a major effect on the world highlighting media bias and the democratic lunacy pushing far more moderate democrats and independants to the open arms of republicans who welcome all. I disagree with trump and all his supporters on a variety of smaller issues but it's never a hate-filled argument we just agree to disagree. When they go low we go high has been proven to be a motto the republicans live by these days not the democrats. \n\nedit: mentioned it in the comments but meant to put this in the post I don't trust the government not to oppress us anymore since the entire platform of the dems seems to be oppression. The weaponization of the government by Obama against political opponents it's only a matter of time they target civilians when there is no more resistance. So I now prefer the status quo on guns but used to support an \"assault rifle\" ban.","subreddit":"The_Donald","title":"the lunatic left made me a trump supporter""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"the lunatic left made me a trump supporter"}

Specifically, they reveal the difference in the way the courts treat liberals vs. conservatives.  \n\n\nWhen liberals file a \"civil rights\" action, they are typically treated favorably by the lower courts, they get injunctions if they want them to help obstruct their opponents, and the judges grant them broad, sweeping rulings that they can mine for precedent value later.  \n\n\nWhen conservatives have to resort to the courts to defend their rights, they have to fight tooth and nail, they are obstructed at every turn by red tape and technicalities, and even if we do eventually get a favorable ruling, the judges define the ruling under the narrowest possible consideration of the circumstances, leaving us as little precedent value as possible, meaning basically that all the left has to do is change their approach slightly and force us back to the courts to beg for our rights.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Walsh: Good News and Bad News About the SCOTUS Pregnancy Center Ruling"}

But often when political topics come up on the internet I see people advocating for the conservative side become the racist, sexist, bigoted monster that the left likes to portray us as. Just because the media says you are racist or that you don\u2019t care about children being murdered in schools doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s true. In fact, it\u2019s not true. Nobody wants kids to die. We just have different ways to go about achieving that goal. In a gun control debate, don\u2019t start arguing from the premise that it doesn\u2019t matter if kids die, or that your guns are more important than kids\u2019 lives. Because you will lose the debate from that argument. Think about what you truly believe in. You do care about dead kids, and decent human being does, you just know that mass shooters don\u2019t care about gun free zones or gun control laws. So please, on behalf of all us conservatives, if you\u2019re gonna speak up for what you believe in, do it civilly, do it competently, and do it for what you actually believe in, not what the left tells you you believe.

{"author":"CptQuestionMark","created_utc":1530284127,"num_comments":35,"score":69,"selftext":"1968 in America was regarded by historians and contemporaries to have been an exceptionally polarized year. Cities burned in the wake of high-profile political violence. The nation's leadership quaked as it faced the existential question of whether to arbitrate justice equally to all of its citizens. Constituents across the entire spectrum were weary as Vietnam seemed to be a lost cause.    \n     \n\nPublic confidence in the President had waned. The Republican frontrunner was hawkish and shiesty, and the Democratic frontrunner failed to captivate the passion of the voters.    \n     \n\nFifty years later this nation is engulfed in a similar civil crisis, but in some respects the damage has been exacerbated by multiple and various factors: the Internet, yellow journalism, anonymity, and the dissassociative and socially obtuse generation of the Information Age.     \n     \n\nAt no where else but reddit is this more apparent. The \/r\/politics board in particular being a safe haven for tribalism and extreme thought. Young people, influenced by dishonest reporters, emboldened by anonymity, and alienated by society, call for coups detat, violent resistance against conservatives, assassinations, and bloodshed -- to uproarious congratulation from the rest of the subreddit.     \n     \n         \nAt universities, once places to gain knowledge from philosophical challenges and exposure to differing viewpoints, extremists have their beliefs affirmed.         \n         \nThey are but a few of thousands who would applaud your gruesome death in the name of their misconstrued righteousness.     \n     \n\nTactless dialogue, desperation, bigotry and identity politics have proven bad for our nation -- which is why I make this post.     \n     \n\nI unequivocally denounce and repudiate senseless violence. I support equal justice under the law and I do not promote bigotry. Bigotry is intolerance for other people's opinions. It's a hallmark of extremism and it's the antithesis of America. I will not harass people at restaurants, cinemas, in airplanes, or at their homes. I will not call for blood.     \n     \n\nI promote sobriety, intellectual honesty, a secure border, and a reasonable approach to immigration. I stand in solidarity with the virtuous and hardworking, disadvantaged by an elitist political establishment. Our policies and our free market economy reflect our dedicated approach to raising the quality of life for all Americans.     \n     \n\nI support bringing back jobs and manufacturing to the United States, and I support fairness among international players.     \n     \n\nNobody here is caught up in the spell of extremism with my approval. I go high. Extremists go low. I will not take to having blame assigned to me for any attacks. I will not have my loyalty to my country questioned. I speak for myself, but I know millions of Americans connect with my sentiments. I also know millions of Americans have been unfairly assailed, stereotyped, and vilified despite posing no threat to the country, and it is time we reach a conclusion in the discourse of this nation that is respectful to their contributions, intelligence and sacrifices.
