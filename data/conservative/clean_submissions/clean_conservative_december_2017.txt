(It already has been, but even more so now with fewer complaints.)\n\n+ The border wall will be built, at least a good part of it, and Trump will find it far easier to get his way with border security.

{"author":"rey-de-nutka","created_utc":1512157493,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"I see a lot of talk about separation of powers, and that's admirable. But I don't see a lot of talk about *the separation of bases and origins of that power*, which I would contend is a supremely important aspect of the larger concept.\n\nAn example is the Seventeenth Amendment, which - while enacted with noble intentions in mind - substantially weakened the Senate's deliberative and autonomous function, instead rendering its method of election almost identical to the House (using the entire state as one mega-district).\n\nIn order to restrain totalitarianism and prevent the specter of authoritarian rule, it's not enough to simply create a system of checks and balances. The underlying election method, and the pool of electors used for specific positions, must be different for every single position. If separation of powers is important, then so too is compartmentalization of these elections, and the power of appointment.\n\nOn a state/local level, consider the appointment of a county sheriff. Have the state governor make a 'long list' of possible candidates for the appointment (initial selection). Then, have the state house whittle down the 'long list' into a 'short list' of candidates (filtering). Then, have the state senate order the 'short list' (ordering), with the best candidates at the top. Finally, have the people in the destination county vote in a referendum whether to confirm or deny the state's pick for the county sheriff, starting with the candidate at the top of the list (confirmation).\n\nIn the above example, the power to select candidates for the county sheriff originates in a statewide gubernatorial election. This means that the governor must select candidates for county sheriff that are acceptable to the majority of the state's electorate. Then, the power of filtering originates from a series of local elections to the state house. This means that if the governor selects malicious candidates, it falls exclusively on the representatives' shoulders to weed them out. Then, the power of ordering originates from an entirely separate series of local elections to the state senate. This means that the state senate must carefully consider which candidate is most able to enforce the state's laws in that county, and rank them accordingly. Finally, the power of confirming or denying the sheriff originates with the people in the county he will serve. This means that if the state attempts to force a bad pick on the people of a county, the county residents can deny his seating, and go down the list, until they find one they like.\n\nWhile seemingly convoluted and unnecessarily complicated, I contend that this particular appointment system is better than directly-elected county sheriffs, for a variety of reasons. For one thing, it makes sure that county sheriffs enforce the law impartially, and that they are sufficiently shielded from unpopular decisions they make within their jurisdiction. For another, it makes sure that no one person holds too much power in appointing and ultimately seating the sheriff, and if anyone in the long chain for the appointment messes up, they will pay for it dearly at the polls. It prevents powerful families in rural counties from capturing the power to enforce the law, and when applied to county judges (appointed for life unless they die, retire, resign, get promoted, become disabled, etc), it prevents them from capturing control of the judiciary - thus cutting down on local corruption. Yet, it preserves county sheriffs' democratic legitimacy in the eyes of the people in his jurisdiction.\n\nWe should not trust any one body to hold too much power over the appointment of specific officials, and I contend that this includes the people, as well.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Thought-provoking concept in separation of powers: the \"atomization of power\""}

{"author":"JohnSemmens","created_utc":1512203059,"num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"Juror Explains Verdict in Murder Trial\n\nThis week, Jose Ines Garcia Zarate, the man who shot and killed Kate Steinle in 2015, was acquitted of all homicide-related charges (murder, manslaughter, negligent homicide) by a San Francisco jury. The sole charge on which jurors could agree he was guilty was \"illegal possession of a firearm.\"\n\nSpeaking \"off-the-record,\" Juror X explained that \"the fact that the defendant had previously been deported five times persuaded us that he was not really responsible for killing Ms. Steinle. On the one hand, several jurors blamed the government for inciting Mr. Garcia's rage. Being repeatedly forced to sneak into the country at great effort drove him to live outside the law. Such a lifestyle entails risky behavior like carrying the weapon he carelessly fired into a crowd of shoppers and tourists at a waterfront pier. If our country's borders were open Mr. Garcia would have been allowed to legally enter and would not have had to join the criminal underworld.\"\n\n\"Other jurors blamed the lack of gun control,\" Juror X continued. \"If no one were allowed to have a gun it wouldn't have been possible for Mr. Garcia to shoot anyone and Ms. Steinle would still be alive. It was felt that it would be unfair to lay all of the blame on Mr. Garcia when it is right-wing politicians who have blocked sensible gun confiscation. Logically, then, since in a sane society it would have to be illegal for anyone to have possession of a firearm, we were able to reach a consensus that convicting Mr Garcia of that charge would lead to the most just outcome that was within our power to bestow.\"\n\n\"All of us agreed that Ms. Steinle's death was a tragic accident,\" Juror X added. \"Mr. Garcia had no intent to kill her or anyone else. He was just blowing off steam. She, unfortunately, was in the wrong place at the wrong time. She wasn't murdered. As a woman she couldn't have been man-slaughtered. And negligent homicide would be a failure to use the care that a normally careful person would. Well, Mr. Garcia is not a normal person. He is a former felon and cannot be held to the same standard that a law-abiding, noncriminal person should be held.\"\n\nSan Francisco Mayor Ed Lee called the verdict \"a clear vindication of our sanctuary policy. It sends a message to all those living in fear of being mistreated by federal immigration goons that they can come to our city and be protected by our laws and, as the decision by this enlightened and socially progressive jury has shown, by the citizens of San Francisco.\"\n\nFlynn to Testify Against Trump\n\nU.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras advised admitted liar Gen. Michael Flynn \"to fully cooperate with special counsel Robert Mueller\" and told him he can avoid substantial prison time \"if and only if he provides substantial assistance in the prosecution of another person.\" Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about a conversation he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the post-election transition period following Donald Trump's victory over presidential rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nInsiders are reporting that Flynn has told Mueller that \"Trump told me to contact the Russians and have them set up the 'accidental' tarmac meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney-General Loretta Lynch at the Phoenix Airport in July 2016. Our thinking was that as a person with demonstrated poor impulse control, Clinton would be unable to pass up the opportunity to bribe or pressure Lynch into blocking any further investigations of his wife's negligent handling of classified materials in her personal emails.\"\n\n\"As it turned out, we were right,\" Flynn is reported to have told Mueller. \"A subsequent Russian hack of FBI emails revealed that Clinton and Lynch did discuss a deal to suppress the investigation. An added bonus from this hack was the discovery that the Obama Administration misused the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) communication intercept system to spy on the Trump campaign.\"\n\nABC's Brian Ross called Flynn's reported testimony \"the 'smoking gun' that will bring down the Trump Administration. The scheme was diabolical. By exploiting Clinton's criminal vulnerability and natural desire to cover up any wrongdoing, the Trump campaign wove a web of such complexity that it completely thwarted the cover up and exposed the Obama Administration's covert efforts to listen-in on Trump and his supporters using a 'national security' ruse. The publication of the hacked emails was an invasion of privacy that deprived Secretary Clinton, President Obama, Director James Comey, and perhaps others of their constitutional right against self-incrimination. That Trump's actions were so far outside of the norms in our political system is a threat we should not tolerate. Thanks to the diligence of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, the day when things get back to normal is now a little bit closer.\"\n\nSoros Says Hungary Undoing Gains of Communism\n\nBillionaire financier and funder of Antifa leftist goons, George Soros complains that current Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban \"is undoing all the progress made during the 40 years the country was ruled by Communists. After World War II, Stalin's troops ensured that the people of Hungary would enjoy the full benefits of a progressive political and social system. Orban is throwing all that away.\"\n\nParticularly irritating to Soros is what he calls \"Orban's perverted use of border fences and guards. He has turned the previous progressive policy on its head by using these traditional barriers to keep migrants out instead of keeping citizens in as had been the practice under Communism. There are millions of Muslims who want to come to Hungary and claim the land for Allah. Orban's racist policy of preventing their migration to Hungary violates their religious freedom. This kind of thing never would have happened if a progressive government were still in charge.\"\n\nIn related news, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an rejected the concept of \"moderate Islam\" and predicted that \"Muslims will soon overwhelm the weak unbelievers who occupy lands that rightfully belong to Islam.\" Erdo?an declared Islam \"superior to Judaism and Christianity\" and insisted that \"tolerance is unacceptable. Muslims will convert or slay these kafirs until all the world is for Allah.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Islamic chat rooms on the Internet the idea of purposely targeting children for death is going viral. Sentiments such as \"I wish that I could travel to Europe or America or Australia and burn their children with oil\" and \"I would choose a kindergarten and a maternity hospital to slaughter them\" garner far more \"likes\" than \"dislikes\" in the comments sections. Nonetheless, UK's Prime Minister Theresa May maintains that \"President Trump's fear of Islamic violence is a greater threat to our way of life than ISIS.\"\n\nNBC Sexual Predator Seeks $30 million Payoff\n\nFormer \"Today Show\" star Matt Lauer is threatening to sue NBC for the $30 million balance owed for the one-and-a-half years remaining on his contract with the network. Lauer was summarily fired earlier in the week following a raft of accusations that he sexually assaulted several women in his office.\n\nLauer's lawyer, Marvin Tushman maintains that \"the firing is a breach of contract. Nothing that my client did was outside the bounds of normal behavior at the network. He wasn't the only one groping and boffing women at 30 Rock. For the NBC brass to make an issue of it after all these years and to single out Matt while letting others skate is manifestly unfair.\"\n\nTushman argued that \"since this kind of behavior from the talent was tolerated over such a long period it created a sort of 'easement right' that Matt thought was a perk of the job. The fact that he was allowed to install a special door locking device to prevent his female visitors from escaping implies that management was okay with what he was doing. That none of these women publicly complained until recently was quite naturally interpreted by Matt as implied consent. And why not? He's a handsome and powerful man. Why wouldn't he think his attentions were wanted?\"\n\nA prospective lawsuit isn't Lauer's only option for blunting the financial impacts of his unemployment. He is rumored to be pitching a \"tell all\" book deal with several publishers. \"I'm thinking that 'Lauer's Ladies' might be a good title for both a book and a movie,\" the former \"Today Show\" host mused.\n\nIn related news, Fox News personality Geraldo Rivera sort of apologized to Bette Midler after she posted a video from 1991 in which she accused him of drugging and groping her in the 1970s. \"We newsmen work in a flirty business,\" he asserted. \"I like to think of myself as more of a caresser or fondler than a groper. As I recall, Bette was unconscious at the time. So her characterization of me as a 'groper' seems harsh and unfair, but I'm a big enough man to take responsibility and I apologize if she feels that I violated her.\"\n\nCouncilwoman Wants to Outlaw Bullet-Proof Glass\n\nPhiladelphia City Councilwoman Cindy Bass is pushing an ordinance that would bar retailers from having bullet-proof glass block customers' access to store employees. The glass is common in convenience markets that serve high-crime sectors of the city.\n\n\"Bullet-proof glass is an insult to minorities,\" Bass contends. \"Lots of businesses in these same neighborhoods\u2014barber shops and bars, for example\u2014don't have these barriers. That's the neighborly way to run a business. If these convenience markets aren't going to be neighborly voluntarily we need to have a law that forces them.\"\n\nRich Kim, whose family has owned a deli in the city for the last 20 years sees the bullet-proof glass as \"a common sense safety measure. It protects employees and discourages robbers. Outlawing it will lead to more crime and more dead bodies.\"\n\nBass characterized Kim's objections as \"racist. He wouldn't be saying these things if all of his customers were Asians. He only wants the barriers to keep black men from obtaining the money they need to feed their families.\" As an alternative she recommended that \"Kim and others like him should buy more insurance to cover the losses from theft. If they're not willing to do that they should get out of the business.\"\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: December 3, 2017 Edition"}

I don't know if people on the left genuinely don't understand how taxes work or if they're just being dishonest about it, but they've managed to reframe *\"taking less of someone's money\"* as *\"giving that person money\"*.\n\nThis is genuinely dangerous in how Orwellian it is. It's a convincing argument on the surface because rich people have a lot of money, so why should we give them more? That sounds like common sense, right? Of course, anyone who understands what taxes are knows that this is nonsense because the rich aren't being *\"given\"* anything. **It's their money to begin with!**\n\nThe rich have money because they provided goods or services that others wanted, or because they were given that money out of someone's own volition (i.e. inheritance). It's their money. It's not the government's money to hand out \"fairly\", and so when the government decides to take less of it, it not *\"giving\"* anything to the wealthy.\n\n**Taking less != giving.**\n\nThis idea is a pretty fundamental concept that most conservatives understand, but the point of this thread is that when you see someone trying to engage in this reframing of taxation, you need to call them out on it. This *\"the GOP is engaging in a wealth transfer from the middle classic to the 1%\"* idea is a powerful cultural force that can really influence young people, but it's nonsense, so when you hear someone make that assertion, you need to call them out on it.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The Democrats are brilliant in how they've managed to reframe \"letting the rich keep more of their money\" as \"transferring wealth from the middle class to the rich\"."}

{"author":"dariusIRL","created_utc":1512425319,"num_comments":1,"score":0,"selftext":"In the movie Mission Impossible 2, there is this scene where there is this gun-like injector thing behind glass. You put your hand into a glove and inside is the gun. (In the movie it was an injector for a virus or something). Basically I was thinking, if you made this type of thing, you could teach how to shoot much more safely, and make gun ranges safer.\n\nThe idea is with the bulletproof glass there, you can't turn the gun back around on yourself, and you can still practice safe shooting with a real gun. There really isn't an alternative.\n\nI don't think it would be too difficult to make, or that expensive. The materials would just be glass and a glove. The glass could also muffle the sound, too, making it less harmful to the ears. I'm not an expert on acoustics, but if it's bulletproof glass, then it seems like it would make it improbable for gun range injuries to occur.\n\nThis would allow you to train anyone at any age to shoot. I think it's important that everyone gets at least some exposure to guns, even if they never intend to shoot one. I think people from all walks of life, and all political ideologies should be fine with this.\n\nOnce the trainee is experienced enough, then obviously you can move to the regular shooting ranges. I think this is a good idea, and liberals should be able to get behind it because it makes it safer to learn how to shoot. Just in general, I think it's win-win.\n\nSince mass shootings are a reality today, I think it's negligence not to teach about guns to children. They are so prevalent, that it's just a reality. Even if a person doesn't want to own one, there is always the possibility of finding one, especially in Urban areas.\n\nSo liberals should be happy since it would make gun ranges safer and less harmful on the ears, and conservatives should be happy because it gets more people exposed to gun safety in general. Finally, you could allow anyone to shoot, even people with mental illness. There is a stigma against mental illness. Quite frankly, a mental illness is the exact same as a physical illness. A lot of soldiers come back from war with some kind of mental illness, and every single soldier I've spoken with, (only about 15 or so, so still a small sample size) says they won't see a doctor because it will take away their ability to shoot.\n\nMake this type of device, and suddenly, they can shoot again, and no one has to worry about whether they are going to turn the weapon on themselves! A lot of guys grow up shooting all their lives, so coming back and having a doctor saying they can't do what they love anymore I think is counterproductive. It makes them make a choice between their mental health and being able to shoot. It makes things worse.\n\nThoughts?\n\nFeel free to steal this idea and make it yourself! I'm thinking the only awkward thing would be how you do cleanup, and maybe there is a bit extra prep involved, and obviously the cost of shooting there would be slightly more expensive, but it's just a thought I had. Want to find something that is simple, and a starting point to bridge this divide we have in our country.\n\nHave a blessed day!","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Had this idea for making gun ranges safer and more liberal-friendly without sacrificing anything"}

But do they actually mean it?  Are they willing to pay more in taxes?  The GOP are in the process of passing a bill that would remove deductions for wealthier people in wealthier states.  The SALT deduction is at the center of the controversy.\n\nThe NYTimes ran an article detailing some of the changes[1].  I would encourage you to read the comments for yourself.\n\n&gt; If a secession movement were to be seriously commenced, count me in. This taxpayer for one is tired of having my federal taxes subsidize the red states, the vast majority of whom already receive more collectively than they pay collectively in federal taxes. This political bill, the true intent of which is only thinly veiled, is the literal definition of adding insult to injury. New Yorkers are by and large generous people, but we're not fools. To hell with those who hate us this much.\n\n\"Fuck poor Republicans!  I'm seceding!\" - 1,200 likes (most popular comment).\n\n&gt; I don't know which genius in congress decided that politicizing taxation and assaulting the pocket books of families in blue states was a smart policy for this country, but it's clear that blue states need to start banding together to protect their own.\n\n\"Taxation used as a political weapon??  I've never heard of such a thing!  The rich should band together!\" - 750 likes.\n\n&gt; Well Terry, New York pays more in Federal taxes than it receives in benefits. States like New York and California have been paying more than their fair share of Federal taxes, which means that lower tax states are being subsidized by us.\n&gt; \n&gt; And Wisconsin receives more than $1.50 in Federal money for every $1.00 it pays in taxes.\n&gt; \n&gt; So much for YOUR fiscal discipline!\n\n\"Rich people pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits - that's bullshit!  The poor need fiscal discipline to succeed!  Something something bootstraps...\" - 718 likes.\n\n&gt; My takeaway from this is that if I, as a taxpayer in a state where people actually want government to do things and tax themselves to get it done, find that the GOP has voted to limit or end mortgage deductions and eliminate SALT (which has been on the books since 1913), then there won't be a single Republican sent to the House in 2018 from those States. I and millions of others will spend every dime we have left to kill the beast in the next election.\n\n\"When I said remove tax loopholes for the rich I didn't mean me!\"\n\n&gt; The reason our local taxes are high is because a good percentage our federal dollars go off to support mainly red states that don't collect enough local taxes to support their own needs. Tell THEM to live within their means. We have a big infrastructure, especially in the cities. We also have severe winters which tear up the infrastructure on a regular basis.\n\n\"My taxes are so high because I have to support the poor!  That's bullshit!  Tell THEM to live within their means!  Muh big city roads!  Muh 5% of the local budget is bankrupting me.\" - 502 likes.\n\n&gt; We in the blue states already subsidize most of the red states, who receive more than they pay into the federal treasury. Here in NY we pay more than we get back. How about your state starting with some fiscal discipline and refuse to take more than you put in. The idea that you subsidize us is laughable. Read up on things a little before you display your ignorance.\n\n\"A tax break isn't a subsidy if *I* receive it!  Only if corporations do! - 300 likes.\n\n1. https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/business/economy/tax-bill-new-york.html","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"The next time a Democrat says \"raise my taxes!\"..."}

Any kind of disagreement with my friends opinions constitutes them as social justice warriors and me as a bigot according to them. It is also not possible to be a good Christian apparently if one were to have the values that I have according to my friends. I am starting to question why I am friends with such people. How have you dealt with similar situations? I am steadfast in my beliefs, a political science graduate, a Christian, and passionate. I don't like the way I am made to feel for having an opinion and put down in a way by those who disagree with me. Why do I also feel like my stance on politics is in the minority despite Trump winning? \n\n\nI guess I somewhat answer my own question when typing this out....why remain friends with people who can't respect your opinion? \n\nThank you in advance. \nTyped from phone sorry for any grammar issues.

{"author":"AuspiciousBoron","created_utc":1512587971,"num_comments":1,"score":0,"selftext":"Those who grumble against postwar modern and contemporary art, exemplified by the works of major artists such as Barnett Newman and Damien Hirst, charge that they are vulgar, confusing, and devoid of any artistic talent, in diametrical opposition to the classical Western tastes of beauty, harmony, and skillfulness, cherished by the grumblers to the utmost. That the prestigious [Turner Prize went to a messy bed and an otherwise empty room with only a recorded tune playing](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/what-to-see/turner-prize-controversies/rachel-whiteread-house/), the same grumblers adduced, is concrete evidence that the state of Western art has \u201clost its ways\u201d; the Turner judges and fellow critics have firmly promulgated ugliness and inanity as a qualifying criteria for art. An obvious consequence of \u201cbad\u201d art's prominence at the close of the 20th century is that traditional artistic tastes have been consigned to the dustbin of Western history, insomuch as their manifestations will never be central pieces in global bienniales.\n\nExaggerating the problem of \u201cbad\u201d art, in the eyes of the grumblers, is the terrible problem of radical identity politics, which has compelled its socio-political stances as winning criteria in art. Though neither necessary nor found in all works, if an artist, especially a young up-and-coming art student trying to succeed, couches a work in the theoretical, opaque language of contemporary theories on race or sex, then there is an almost a guaranteed chance that it will be selected to be shown in a gallery of some standing \u2013 even if the artist only did it as a practical afterthought. By the same token, if an artist chooses to negatively criticize identity politics through a piece, then there is zero chance it will ever be recognized by a credible critic or curator in the art world. Therefore, the grumblers conclude that art has been deeply politicized in the direction of identity politics, taking on a ulterior socio-political function beyond the self-contained form of the artwork itself.\n\nDespite trying to be oftentimes avant-garde and radical, the grumblers rebut that, in reality, the artworks are very much the products of the entrenched art establishment. Art schools and art critics perpetuate the prevailing practices and philosophies of postwar art, while wealthy collectors, perhaps to pursue the trendy cultural habitus (in the language of sociologist Pierre Bourdieu), maintain the [multi-million funding of major international artists](https://news.artnet.com/market/25-artists-account-nearly-50-percent-postwar-contemporary-auction-sales-1077026). A deeply ensconced art establishment of like-minded artists, scholars and rich buyers, leave practically little to no room for growth of alternative institutions that would both embrace classical Western aesthetics and challenge the status quo.\n\nThe grumblers may be written off as backward reactionaries waxing on about a past that no longer exists, whom are merely too uncultured to appreciate the finer nuisances of postwar art. While this claim is valid, a more constructive position, this article holds, is that the grumblers have legitimate concerns on beauty, artistic labor, and aesthetics that have existed and thrived within the Western tradition since the Middle Ages, and which cannot be ignored simply because the 21st century is no longer the 17th century. To wit, the grumblers have legitimate intellectual positions on art.\n\nWhere are those intellectual positions? They are found in the writings of living conservative scholars such as Roger Kimball and Roger Scruton, whose seminal writings made the case for the superiority of classical Western art over postwar art, while the cultural activism of individuals such as Jordan Peterson and the Youtube bugbear [Paul Joseph Watson](https://youtu.be/Ea39dHj01yc) advocates for the ideals of Western culture. Together, they would define beauty, skillfulness and meaning as the constituent basis of Western art, in polar opposition to postwar art. Countering identity politics in art, they would contend that enlightened, individual human expressions are more elevated than identity categories and indecipherable theory. With an intellectual platform to stand on, the grumblers can state with affirmation that what the sought is valid after all, and not merely humdrum sentiments of a lost past.\n\nIn actuality, there are ateliers and art organizations such as the [Art Renewal Center](https://www.artrenewal.org/) preaching the classical ideal of realism in works, and no doubt many individual artists are working to be a new Praxiteles, Schinkel, or Holbein. However, in the eyes of the grumblers with an intellectual understanding, these artists may still lack an overarching intellectual mooring. Without it, a work runs the risk being simply reduced to objects of sentimentality or kitsch, or merely art for the sake of art and demonstration of skills. Furthermore, the lack of an intellectual context will make art criticism and serious, philosophical recognition difficult if not impossible. In other words, an artwork needs an intellectual groundwork to receive critical appreciation and to stand the test of time.\n\nTo solve the urgent intellectual questions presented by the grumblers, the first step is to unite new and existing art practitioners under the pro-classical Western ideals delineated by the aforementioned scholars and activists, positioning their art as both culturally and intellectually worthy pursuits. To seize the means of artistic production in its entire range, it is imperative to create art in all forms of media, including, but not limited to, handicrafts, sequential art, clothing, photography, animation, cinematography, and digital works. They will need funding from generous patrons in addition to relevant grants and scholarships, equalizing the multi-million cashflow into the other camp. Once sufficient works have been completed, a major exhibitions should be held for the greater public, many of whom have, without a doubt, waited a long time to see a revitalization of classical Western aesthetics in its beauty and grandeur.\n\nSince the passing of the Middle Ages, the history of Western thought and art, the latter a natural handmaiden to the former, have been defined by successive movements that challenged the hegemony of the former. This is not to say that each is in general \u201cbetter\u201d than the former (for there have been art movements that served or were co-opted as the propaganda wing of oppressive regimes and ideologies), but rather that innovation between generations is at the heart of Western arts. If the postwar art world is the current iteration of Western (and very much international) art, then it is only natural that a new breed of artists, founded on firm beliefs in classical Western ideals of art, rise up and contend with the current establishment. As for those who are not art practitioners, there is always more catalogues, magazines, articles and books waiting to be written in support of pro-classical Western art, an indispensable counterweight to the publication powerhouse of art school theories. The grumblers will certainly be delighted to have their own Vasari, Ruskin, and Tzara.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Time for Pro-Classical Western Art to Go on the Offensive"}

Reading his story of rising from nothing, from a Geechee-dialect speaking black kid in Georgia, to Yale and the Supreme Court, was inspiring to me.\"\n\nIt could just be a case of WaPo failing to do their due diligence... or it could be a deliberate and dishonest attempt to resurrect the Anita Hill narrative, long after people may not quite remember what a shameful hit job it was during the Clarence Thomas hearings. It could be both: with a fake author approaching WaPo with something that they'd certainly love to share with the world.\n\nThe Democrats threw Senator Franken under the bus because they want to come for Republicans next, using old, unproven, and situationally-ambiguous allegations as their weapon. The Democrat-Media complex will be coming for Trump, but why not try to take a pound of flesh from Justice Thomas too? It bolsters the narrative that they are trying to clean their house, while across the aisle we tolerate predators (which is an inversion of reality, as usual). \n\nI don't think the people behind this farce actually want Justice Thomas to step down and be replaced by a Trump appointee... it won't happen anyway.

Trey Gowdy (R-SC) called the revelations \"very damaging to the reputation and credibility of the FBI. Even though there appears to be considerable evidence that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton violated the law, the agency. under then Director James Comey, bent over backwards to excuse and cover up these crimes. Comey even went so far as to assert that no prosecutor would have gone forward with a case against Clinton. As a former prosecutor myself, I strongly disagree.\"\n\n\"In contrast to the 'free pass' given to Clinton, Special Counsel Mueller's investigation of supposed collusion between Donald Trump and Russia has resembled Inspector Javert's relentless pursuit of Jean Valjean,\" Gowdy said. \"He has staffed his team with a bevy of Clinton partisans, including a few who appear to have aided in covering up her misdeeds. After more than six months on the case, there is still no evidence of a Trump/Russia collusion. Instead there is an indication that both the Clinton campaign and the FBI may be implicated in manufacturing the bogus GPS dossier and that this false document was used to secure a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign.\"\n\nWillard Weezel, spokesman for Comey, attempted to clarify the former FBI Director's stance, saying that \"Director Comey wasn't simply addressing the legal issues, but was also weighing the practical issues. On the one hand, if he had referred the matter to Attorney General Lynch it would have seriously damaged a major Party's chances to win an upcoming election. Keeping the FBI out of politics was an important objective.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, people engaging in actions that could have a negative impact on the Clintons seem to experience an unusually high frequency of untimely fatal accidents and suicides,\" Weezel observed. \"So, derailing a possible investigation of the former Secretary probably saved a few lives. Rather than condemning Director Comey for letting one guilty person get away, he deserves the nation's thanks for helping save some lives.\"\n\nIn related news, it turns out that Aaron Zebley, a member of Mueller's investigative team, represented Justin Cooper, the man who enabled Hillary Clinton's efforts to evade scrutiny of her communications by setting up an unsecure server in her Chappaqua home where she illegally transferred and stored classified government documents. Cooper also destroyed Clinton's BlackBerries with a hammer to prevent them from being entered as evidence of her lawbreaking. Zebley's efforts included stonewalling congressional attempts to interview Cooper.\n\nFranken Persecuted by Democrats\n\nDespite asserting \"I've done nothing wrong\" and expressing confidence that he would have been cleared of wrongdoing by a Senate Ethics Committee investigation, Sen Al Franken (D-Minn) announced that he would be resigning his seat \"in the next few weeks.\"\n\nFranken, pressured by dozens of his fellow Democrats to \"resign for the good of the Party,\" complained about \"the double standard in our society that lets Donald Trump get away with boasting about groping women, but hangs me because I actually took the initiative to interact with these women. As Trump said on the Access Hollywood tape 'women let you get away with anything when you're a celebrity.' Well, I am a celebrity as a senator and was a celebrity as a TV star and comedian. Why can't I get away with it?\"\n\nThe Senator pointed out that \"my interactions were inspired by my respect for women and their delectable bosoms and buttocks. What my accusers are claiming was unwanted touching were merely my expression of affection for their being willing to be in the same room with me. That some of the women I have touched would turn against me after all I've done to uphold their right to have abortions seems cold and ungrateful. But I will do my best to try to understand and adapt to the new social norms that are being forced on me.\"\n\nWhile contending that \"Franken was railroaded for behavior that has traditionally been tolerated as a 'perk' of powerful men,\" MSNBC's Chris Matthews argued that \"the sacrifice of a rising star in the Democratic Party on the basis of what were either unproven allegations or minor infractions shows that the worst anyone can say about Democrats is that they are too pure. Franken had a choice between resigning or switching to the GOP where molesting women is an accepted standard. That he chose the nobler option while Trump and Moore cling to their political aspirations is a clear distinction of which Party has the moral high ground.\"\n\nMatthews dismissed the more spectacular allegations against former President Clinton and Senator Kennedy as \"moot points since neither currently holds public office. Besides, no woman ever demanded that they resign. At the very least, that is prima facie evidence that their interactions were all consensual.\"\n\nIn related news, Rep. Ruben Kihuen (D-Nev) refuses to resign over sexual harassment accusations. He says he had House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's permission: \"She knew all about this before I was elected in 2016. She even donated to my campaign. I'm not going to let her add my scalp to her trophy case.\"\n\nKaepernick Awarded Ho Chi Minh Red Star\n\nThis week Colon Kaepernick, the original \"kneeling football player,\" was honored with the annual Ho Chi Minh Red Star award for his efforts against capitalist oppression. The gem-encrusted jewel was presented by 1972 award recipient Jane Fonda at the ACLU of Southern California's annual Bill of Rights Dinner.\n\nFonda hailed \"Kaepernick's extraordinary courage in the face of the extreme dangers he endured while being forced to risk life and limb for the amusement of unjustly rich team owners and rabidly racist fans of the barbaric sport as a player and the enmity of those who disrespected his right to disrespect the United States National Anthem and flag. His defiance has inspired fellow players to join his protest and fellow antifascists to take to the streets. He is truly America's top anti-capitalist of the year.\"\n\nObama Claims Credit for Booming Economy\n\nRosy economic statistics showing a robust 3.3% annual growth in gross domestic product and an all time low in the unemployment rate for Hispanics prompted former President Barack Obama to assert that \"the real credit for this good news belongs to me.\"\n\n\"Trump wants everyone to believe that his relaxation of regulations and championing of tax cuts deserve the credit,\" Obama said. \"What he and everyone else is overlooking is that the stringent regulations and high taxes that prevailed for my eight year term built up the 'coiled spring' pressure that, when released by Trump's moves, allowed the economy to rebound to rates of growth never achieved during the period of sacrifice I forced the nation to endure.\"\n\n\"I wasn't overlooking that,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) insisted. \"That's why its so important that we stop the Republican tax cut bill. The loosening and stimulating effects of this bill would undermine the coiled spring effects that President Obama and Congress worked so hard to impose on our economy over the previous eight years.\"\n\nPelosi was particularly wary of what she characterized as \"the narcotic-like addiction of lower tax rates on the average American worker. If the GOP bill passes, a typical family would see an average tax cut of more than a thousand dollars a year for the next ten years. This would deter them from working overtime or taking second jobs. They'd put in fewer hours working to pay the taxes needed to pay benefits to the poor. It's bad enough that the unilateral moves toward deregulation that President Trump has taken have increased the number of jobs available. Soon he will be expecting many of those on welfare to take some of these jobs. Their loss of leisure time would be catastrophic to their lifestyle. It would be like Armageddon for these Americans and the Democrats who champion their rights to sustenance and freedom from wage slavery.\"\n\nMassachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren echoed Pelosi's opposition to the tax cut bill calling it \"a vile and despicable scam that every right-thinking American must oppose,\" even though she herself refuses to read the legislation because \"I don't want to pollute my mind with such trash.\"\n\nTrump Recognizes Jerusalem as Israeli Capital\n\nAfter three previous presidents neglected to abide by legislation ordering the United States to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, President Trump obeyed the law by announcing that we will be moving our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nThe move was denounced by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah who contends that \"this humiliation of 1.5 billion Muslims is immoral and illegal. Allah has given all the world to the Muslims. Trump's attempt to claim Jerusalem for Satan and his Jewish demons contradicts the eternal laws written in the Quran. Death and sorrow will be the payment extracted from the Jews and their allies.\"\n\nNasrallah's statement was followed by the vandalization of a Kosher restaurant in Amsterdam. Reinier van Dantzig, who heads the the left-leaning Democrats 66 Party's faction on the Amsterdam City Council blamed \"Trump's kowtowing to Zionist extremists and ignoring the sensitivities of the Muslim minority that lives among us.\" Herman Loonstein, who heads the Federative Jewish Netherlands group, condemned van Dantzig's statement. \"It is not the Jew who owns the restaurant, nor the government of Israel, nor the President of the United States that is responsible,\" he said. \"It is the man who smashed the windows. Placing the blame where it doesn't belong was the cowardly and obscene tactic of the Nazis for their Kristallnacht atrocity. We must not emulate their example.\"\n\nSen. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif) also denounced Trump's decision calling it \"an invitation to violence. It's not so much a question of what is right, but what is prudent. Twenty years ago, I was an idealistic young woman who voted for the law mandating the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital because it was the right thing to do. I now oppose this because it is the prudent thing to do. Over the last two decades Islam has become much more deadly in its assault against other faiths. Rather than inflame Muslims by challenging their right to rule the world, the safer course is to entangle them in unending negotiations\u2014as has been the policy of our government under the three successive administrations prior to the current one.\"\n\nPresidential Press Secretary Sarah Sanders pointed out that \"all of the violence carried out by Islamic extremists\u2014the World Trade Center attack, the Orlando nightclub massacre, and the San Bernardino shootings, to name some prominent examples\u2014has occurred during a period in which the United States has refused to recognize the capital chosen by the Israeli government. It doesn't seem to me that the era of appeasement has been much of a factor in mitigating Islamic violence. Maybe it's time to try a strong stand and do the right thing.\"\n\nIn related news, Gerard Araud, the French ambassador to the U.S., took the occasion of December 7 to blame \"the refusal of the United States to stop Hitler before his troops invaded France in 1940 led directly to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. If the Americans had come to our aid earlier Japan would not have dared to attack them.\" The Ambassador failed to mention that in 1938 France and England assisted Hitler in dismembering Czechoslovakia in the infamous Munich Agreement.\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: December 10, 2017 Edition"}

So I said the following: \n\n\"Any research that points to sex changes being good for transgender well being? Pre and post surgery, the suicide rates remain atrocious. It's a mental disorder and should be treated like one, until proved otherwise.\n\nI can sympathize with trans people who feel out of place and out of body, but why force such a vital decision (transgender surgery for military) on American tax payers, when the science isn't settled on whether that surgery is good for their well being or not? Provide quality mental help instead.\"\n\nI got the idea that the surgery has not been proven to be effective and while I only got linked to one peer reviewed study in Canada with a sample size of about 380 people or something, I also got linked to statements made by many organizations like the APA and other reputable organizations recognizing transition surgery as vital to transgender wellbeing. So clearly, there's enough of a consensus that the military is willing to subsidize treatment.\n\nAnother issue that ties in with this, is the recognizing of gender as a social construct. Is this point now irrefutable? Jordan Peterson, in his senate hearing for bill C-16, talked about how the liberals have not been able to win the argument scientifically, so they are pushing their agenda in other ways. I agreed when Peterson said that gender being a social construct doesn't have scientific basis, but I suppose I never researched for myself whether that was true or not.\n\nWonder your thoughts on this and if there are any major groups of scientist that are against the idea of gender being a social construct or transgender surgery being ineffective. I'm open to changing my mind, but I feel I have been wrong on transgender issues for a long time if indeed, surgery is the best way to help out our transgender community.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Thoughts on consensus of scientific community that transgender issues can be solved by gender re-assignment and general acceptance that gender is a social construct"}

{"author":"tyros","created_utc":1513017831,"num_comments":78,"score":0,"selftext":"So, I'm a conservative on all issues except gun control. I want to present my argument and engage in a debate so I can test if my argument has any merit.\n\nI argue for restricting ALL guns to law enforcement and for hunting/sport only for the following reason. By simply reducing the number of guns in a country you statistically reduce the chance of a person getting shot (accidentally or otherwise). Let's say we have a country with strict gun laws; it's got 50 million people and 500,000 guns. So there's 1 gun for every 100 people (1:100 gun/people ratio). On the other hand, we have a country like the US with 300 million people and 300 million guns (1 gun for every person). So, answer me this: would you agree that, statistically, you are way more likely to get shot in a country like the US with a higher gun to people ratio? Basically, for public safety reasons, we should implement a gun ban.\n\nNow, you might say, there are other things detrimental to our safety, should we ban them too? Fast food causes obesity, which in turn causes heart disease and death. That's true. However, you, eating junk food, do not endanger my life in any way, you are free to do so as the only life you endanger is your own. You carrying a gun on the other hand, increases the likelihood of an innocent person getting shot. \n\nNo matter how much you argue that you are a responsible gun owner, the mathematical probability of a person getting shot goes up the more guns there are in a country.\n\nI know this is a radical proposal for a country where guns and 2nd amendment are such big part of the culture. I also realize that implementing it would not be an easy task - try taking away guns from American citizens who've been accustomed to having them their whole life. The only analogy that comes to mind is smoking - it also used to be a big part of the culture and everyone smoked. Once people started realizing the negative effect of smoking and that it affects innocent bystanders as well (second hand smoking), smoking is pretty much non-existent now. So it's a culture change; the only way this will work if gun owners themselves realize that by purchasing guns they indirectly contribute to endangering public safety.\n\nI want to hear counter arguments from you guys.\n\n\nEDIT: This has been really fun, thank you guys. Most of the arguments here did not convince me. I think the biggest reason is that gun ownership is so ingrained in American culture that it's hard for us to even consider an alternative.\n\nHere's the summary of your arguments:\n\n   * the challenge of implementing a gun ban; it would be very hard to convince gun owners to let go of their guns (I fully understand this and that is why my suggestion was to do it slowly over a couple generations as it would be a cultural shift)\n\n   * fear of \"how will I be able to protect my family\" (very understandable, but you have to take into account that with no guns there will be nothing to protect your family from)\n\n   * fear of tyrannical government. This is a big one and the one I'm on the fence about. While I doubt an untrained population would be able to do much against a trained US military with superior technology, out of all presented here, it's the one I think makes the most sense. But still, it's based on fear, and like some of you pointed out, fear is not a good basis for making laws.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Please critique my pro-gun control argument"}

The Left has been looking for a weapon such as this for a while. They've tried racism, sexism, corruption, etc with middling results. Most of those are so overused by now that people have become numb to it. But we're at a point where accusing someone of sexual assault still has that visceral gut-punch reaction that racism accusations used to have, that it's still pretty effective. Tonight obviously showed this. \n\nPlan on this weapon being used for all it's worth next year. The Left and their lackeys in the media *will* be trotting out similar accusations against Republicans in next year's mid terms, especially in places where they already stand to have a very tight race and a few percentage points in their favor or from voters staying home would be enough to pull off the win. Late next September, early October, we are going to see \"bombshell\" interviews and claims from alleged victims of Republican Senators and Representatives. Tonight was a trial run and the Left is absolutely giddy that it worked.

{"author":"mbarnar","created_utc":1513200470,"num_comments":4,"score":9,"selftext":"Now before I start I want to preface before everyone freaks out. *I am not suggesting voter fraud* I just did some data analysis to see what changed in terms of trends.\n\nSo I did some data analysis on Jefferson County [found here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7Mr92zJ5UM-enZQV3Y0RTA5ZVhiLUpYaUk0YUtWeEIzc3dJ/view?usp=drivesdk), comparing their results to previous years, trying to find trends, etc. And I noticed a few crazy things that definitely explain how the GOP lost.\n\nFor starters, if you look through my data you'll see that for every senate/presidential election since 2008, the GOP consistently turns out about 110-140K (a little lower for the midterms naturally).  But then, yesterday, they turned out 60,000. Yes, that's right, 60,000.  That means 80,000 less voters than 2016.\n\nNot only that, but if you look at the total turnout there is a 90,000 decrease in voters, 80K being GOP. Which says the DNC only lost about 10K votes from 2016.\n\nThat right there is your election. More Republicans vote in Jefferson county, GOP wins.\n\n\nNext I looked at overall turnout by county to see if there were any other counties that had a similar trend. What did I see? The 2nd biggest county in terms of voters, Mobile, had about a 60,000 decrease in voters this election.\n\nAfter a little Google research (you can do yourself) I noticed that they too had *drastic* decreases in GOP turnout, DNC? Not so much. The exact numbers were roughly 50,000 less GOP votes to only 10K less DNC votes.\n\nThat right there is how the DNC won the election. 130,000 Republican votes went missing (aka ppl didn't show up to vote). \n\nIronically, that 130K right there would've put Moore at 54% about +8.. which was my prediction based on trend data.  I guess that's the problem with trends though, there's outliers.\n\nAnyways, I figured I'd love to get your take, what do you guys think? Are you as surpised that GOP turnout was *that low*?

As part of my final day of class, the CEO of the teaching organisation came and gave a big speech about how he worked his way up blah blah blah and finally added at the end that he was passionate about social justice. He then started to rant about the evils of capitalism alongside being pro-education and very materialistic (I don't get this obvious contradiction but whatever).\n\nHe left and one of the trainers returned and asked the class our opinions regarding the CEO. I being the loud, proud political pundit that I am, responded by saying that its funny to have a communist CEO for what is clearly a \"for profit\" company, which then caused the initial beginnings of a heated political discussion which was shut down fairly quickly. \n\nAs someone who is his early 20s and has survived the shitshow of academia, I'm amazed that people are this retarded to the true meaning of political terms and clearly don't have the capacity to understand what they are actually saying? I'm not the sort of person to keep my mouth shut, even if I should but the level ignorance is exactly why the western world is in this perilous position.

Of course, these votes were cast with the full blessing of the Democrat party, since the Democrat party a) supports open borders, and b) opposes voter ID laws. See how that works? The dirty Dems let illegals flood into our country, all while making it super-easy for them to vote. What a scam!\n\nNow, it appears that the Democrats are once again up to their dirty tricks and games. Yesterday, Bill Mitchell [posted a tweet](https://twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/941045103673606144) that discussed rumors of black voters from Mississippi being bused in to Alabama to vote.\n\nThen, Reddit posts from /u/Warren4Prez discussing this *exact* strategy [were unearthed.](https://twitter.com/NewRightNetwork/status/941268101429190657) See the screenshots [here.](https://twitter.com/DrShayPhD/status/940857253078368256)\n\nAnd now, [a video featuring an interview with a Doug Jones voter](https://streamable.com/qid1q) is spreading across the Internet. In this interview, the voter brazenly admits that Jones voters \"came here all the way from different parts of the country.\"\n\nAgain, it should be noted that these reports are unverified -- they are simply rumors.\n\nBut the presence of election fraud would serve as a plausible explanation for why Judge Moore has not yet conceded. Perhaps these rumors are indeed valid, and maybe Judge Moore will contest the validity of the election results. We'll see what happens.\n\nBut for now, keep your eyes open for additional pieces of evidence which either prove or disprove these election fraud rumors.\n\nWe must remain vigilant!\n\n**UPDATE:** I reached out to /u/Warren4Prez for comment. They denied participating in -- or otherwise having any knowledge of -- election fraud in the Alabama Senate race.","subreddit":"TheNewRight","title":"BREAKING: Rumors of Election Fraud Emerge in Wake of Alabama Senate Election""num_comments":0,"score":2,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"BREAKING: Rumors of Election Fraud Emerge in Wake of Alabama Senate Election"}

This became very apparent to me in my first year of university. Someone invited me to a banquet and I told them that I am vegan, which was a reasonable thing to warn them about so I wouldn't be awkwardly standing there. I ended up bringing some cookies, which were all gone in about 30 minutes. At the banquet/luncheon, I was talking to this person about politics, which I immediately could tell which side he was on. When it came up to him that I also have conservative beliefs, he was genuinely surprised. He said that he assumed I would be far-left since I am vegan and the few vegans I have known in real were calling me a hypocrite since I am pro-life. I couldn't believe this. Wouldn't it be the other way around? Wouldn't saying that it is okay to kill babies while it's not okay to kill animals a perfect example of hypocrisy? Of course, I do it for different reasons, but I try to be as logically consistent as I can and I always assumed that was what university was about - thinking. Not at all. There are so many \"tribes\" in school. If you step outside of your tribe just a little bit, you're gone. Luckily, the Turning Point organization at my school seems to be fairly accepting of people in my shoes, but I can't understand why university has become so stupid. And it isn't like it would be smart for me to leave at this point, being in debt already I might as well have a degree from all of this. The only reason I even bother calling myself conservative these days is that I believe that life should be preserved, I think there should be fairer taxes and, one of my more controversial opinions, I actually like \"the patriarchy\" - it works. For the most part, men seem to be better at being leaders and it has benefitted society for years on end. It may also interest me because I have always wanted to be a housewife, but have been 'crucified' by feminists for wanting such a thing. Even my mom is incessantly asking about my career. Perhaps it doesn't help that I live in California and everybody around here is in a bubble, which I will fix by transferring to Montana next year. I guess my summary is; where do I go from here?","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I cannot stand tribalism, but where do I belong..."}

{"author":"JohnSemmens","created_utc":1513382158,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"Exempting Anyone from Funding Abortions \"Unconstitutional\"\n\nIn an op ed for the left-wing Sacramento Bee, Crystal Strait, president of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, blasted the Trump Administration's rollback of an Obama policy mandating that religious organizations must include abortion in the health insurance offered to employees, calling it \"a violation of women's constitutional rights to 'life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.'\"\n\n\"Few things are more stifling to freedom than the burdens of motherhood,\" Strait wrote. \"Preventing a woman from obtaining an abortion condemns her to a life of subservience to another person. This is tyranny. That President Trump would authorize a change in regulations that exempts groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor from paying for the abortions of pregnant women who work with them, illegally and immorally undermines the grant of freedom given by former President Obama.\"\n\nStrait argued that \"couching the new rules as an expansion of the freedom of those with religious objections to opt out of financing what they view as 'murder' twists the plain meaning of freedom and allows religious prejudices to trample every woman's right to have someone else pay for this necessary health benefit. Saying that women are free to purchase their own abortions or that others are free to donate funds to aid the poor to get abortions dodges the fundamental issue. Government has the obligation to mandate universal access to our basic rights\u2014either by funding them with tax dollars or compelling employers to fund them.\"\n\nPlanned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards suggested that \"the kind of backsliding on this fundamental human right we have seen from the Trump Administration might have been averted if more women who have had abortions would do more bragging about them. On the surface, the procedure can seem scary. The fact that there are people who vocally condemn it can be daunting. Words of encouragement from women who have survived the procedure and gone on to fruitful and productive lives should persuade others who might otherwise hesitate to take the plunge.\"\n\nIn related news, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf vowed to veto legislation that would ban dismemberment abortions of babies more than 20 weeks old. \"The effort to put the rights of an unborn infant ahead of those of the mother who wants to terminate that infant's life is vile and grotesque,\" Wolf declared. \"I want every voter in the state to know that I can be counted on to defend their right to escape from involuntary parenthood at any point prior to the birth of their child.\"\n\nDems Confused by Rosenstein Actions\n\nThe emergence of evidence that several members on the staff of Special Investigator Robert Mueller engaged in partisan political activities aimed at thwarting Donald Trump's election and concocting an \"insurance policy\" to cope with an undesired election outcome has Democrats fuming.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland), one of 58 representatives to vote in favor of impeaching Trump, attacked FBI Deputy Director Rod Rosenstein, calling him \"a turncoat. He may think that his responsibility for bringing down Donald Trump ended when he appointed Mueller to head the special investigation of Russian collusion and granted him an ethics waiver. But with the collusion narrative withering due to lack of evidence, the need for another narrative is essential. By letting the story line drift into one of partisan bias within the Mueller team, Rosenstein has failed to uphold his part in the movement to rid the nation of this enemy of progressive government.\"\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) professed himself \"befuddled by all the concern. Strzok, Page, and the others were not saying anything about Donald Trump that the majority of Americans weren't also thinking. Remember, Hillary was the choice of the majority of those who voted. Trump only won because of a constitutional fluke substituting electoral votes for actual votes.\"\n\nTalking Points Memo publisher Josh Marshall assailed the leak of text messages between FBI personnel Peter Strzok and Lisa Page as \"a massive invasion of privacy. Individuals in this country have a right to privately work on behalf of whatever political cause they favor without having to fear that their actions would be exposed by uninvited eavesdropping.\"\n\nMarshall rejected the idea that since the text messages were exchanged on government issued devices during times when the two FBI agents were supposed to be working they were fair game. \"Rosenstein could have and should have suppressed this information for the good of the country,\" Marshall contended. \"Honesty and transparency must not be allowed to derail the progressive agenda.\"\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) advised that \"I think it may be too early to give up on our guys in the FBI and Department of Justice. I think Rosenstein is 100% honorable and I think Mueller is a 100% professional. I say we give them a chance to redeem themselves. For all we know, Rosenstein's apparent disloyalty may be a scheme to entrap Trump and his henchmen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans in Congress seem eager to further explore the covert actions by the FBI to aid the election of Hillary Clinton as president. Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI) is raising questions about FBI Director James Comey's July 2016 exoneration of Clinton for her gross negligence in handling classified emails. Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) has requested more information about the \"insurance policy\" discussed by Strzok, Page, and FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) wants senior Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie Ohr, a Fusion GPS employee, to testify about their opposition research against the Trump campaign.\n\nTurkey Supplying Weapons to Islamic Thugs in Germany\n\nGerman intelligence wiretaps revealed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and officials of his AKP Party have been transferring money to leaders of the \"Osmanen Germania\" (Ottoman Germany) biker gang. Ilkay Arin, German representative of the Union of European Turkish Democrats (UETD) \u2013the lobbying arm of the AKP in Europe\u2014defended the moves, calling them \"a righteous implementation of the jihad the Quran instructs all Muslims to wage against the unbelievers.\"\n\nMetin K\u00fcl\u00fcnk, a close friend of Erdogan, insists that \"given the rising levels of violence in Germany, it is essential that all Muslims be armed in order to defend themselves and to slay those who resist Allah's call for Muslims to conquer the Earth. Of course, none of this would have been necessary if the Zionist conspiracy hadn't stopped Germany from cleansing the world of Jews during World War II.\"\n\nDeidre Berger, director of the American Jewish Committee Berlin Office, confirmed that a scientific study of the opinions of the horde of Muslim refugees admitted to Germany under Merkel's \"open borders\" policy revealed deeply embedded anti-Semitic attitudes. \"They see Jews as the master manipulators of every evil inflicted on the world,\" Berger reported. \"Many are great fans of Hitler and justify the Holocaust because of this belief.\"\n\nIn related news, the Bundestag voted 505-152 to raise their own pay. The raise was backed by Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the pro-business liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens. The Alternative for Germany's Stefan Keuter called the move \"shameful. The government has failed the German people. The refugees that are flooding our country are destroying our culture and threatening everyone safety. They shouldn't be getting raises.\" Merkel disagreed saying that \"Keuter's contention that everyone's safety is threatened refutes his argument. No one's safety is more important to the Reich than that of the members of government. The raises will help us defend ourselves by enabling us to buy stronger locks, build better home security systems, and hire more bodyguards.\"\n\nMeanwhile, under the leadership of Germany and France, the European Union is suing Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic for refusing to \"bear their fair share of the invasion of Muslim refugees from the Middle East. The burdens cannot be the sole responsibility of those member nations that voluntarily admit these migrants. The fact that the citizens of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have rejected open borders is irrelevant. Equity necessitates that all must be compelled to participate.\"\n\nSanders Defends Canadian Single-Payer Health Care System\n\nWaiting Your Turn: Wait Times for Health Care in Canada, a research report published by the Fraser Institute, found \"a median waiting time of 21.2 weeks between referral from a general practitioner and receipt of treatment.\" This is the longest in the history of Fraser's annual survey and 128% longer than the first survey in 1993. The wait to see a specialist for a consultation is now 177% longer than in 1993.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (S-Vt) averred that \"long lines don't bother me. Important members of society can jump these queues if need be. Making less important patients wait is a more socially optimal outcome than a system where each individual is free to purchase the type of insurance or treatment he deems warranted by his condition and resources.\"\n\nSanders also says \"there's a silver lining in making people wait. In the vast majority of cases people get well without treatment. Making people wait is a relatively painless means of reducing the total cost of the nation's medical bill. And let's not overlook the fact that medical treatment itself is the third leading cause of death in the United States. Odds are that having to wait for care will probably save lives.\"\n\nTrump Refusal to Resign an \"Impeachable Offense\"\n\nLiberal radio host Thom Hartmann called President Trump's refusal to step down at the request of Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) \"as blatant a demonstration of sexual harassment as I've ever seen. After the Senator politely demanded that Trump resign following a renewed series of allegations of sexual misconduct Trump callously blew her off. That's horrifying and clearly am impeachable offense.\"\n\nGillibrand wasn't the only Democrat insisting that warmed over allegations ought to be enough to oust a sitting president. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore) also called on Trump to resign saying that \"the sheer number of accusations represents a 'critical mass' that proves his guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Wyden's colleagues Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore) and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) concurred. \"Trump is a proven liar,\" Booker asserted. \"He said he would build a wall. There's no wall. He said he would repeal Obamacare. He didn't. Against this overt proof of dishonesty, the possibility that some of his accusers may be motivated by animus or venality to lie dwindles in importance. Decency demands that he resign. If he won't, impeachment is our last resort.\"\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: December 17, 2017 Edition"}

Its apparent that libs haven't read the bill or done any research. Lets take a closer look at what is actually happening here. I'm open to a reasonable debate, but I fail to understand what libs are upset about. Source: Failing [NY TIMES](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/15/us/politics/final-republican-tax-bill-cuts.html)\n\n**THE MAJOR CHANGES**\n\n* Number of Brackets: Have changed from SEVEN under old plan to SEVEN under new plan. I guess libs are mad that there aren't seventeen brackets in the bill? \n\n*  Rates: Other than the lowest bracket, each tax rate has decreased. This is good for basically everyone. This is bad for literally no one. \n\n* Standard Deduction: DOUBLED. This is good for everyone. This is bad for people who don't like money and want things complicated. Sure, the personal exemption is gone, but DOUBLING the standard deduction more than makes up for it. \n\n* Child Tax Credit: DOUBLED. Now you get $2000 per kid instead of $1000. This is good for people with kids. Why are libs with kids upset about this? I... dont.... know.....\n\n**STUFF THAT DIDN'T CHANGE BUT LIBS ARE STILL MAD ABOUT**\n\n\n* 401(k) caps. They weren't reduced. You still can contribute the same amount. Stop making things up libs.\n\n* Student loan interest deduction. You can still deduct $2500. It didn't change. Stop accusing the GOP of bankrupting students. \n\n* Grad tuition waivers. These are still tax free. It didn't change. Stop accusing the GOP of bankrupting grad students.\n\n**MINOR CLAUSES THAT LIBS WILL IGNORE**\n\n* 529 savings account for K-12th grade. Whats this? A pre-tax savings account to help all families afford private school tuition? The audacity.... \n\n* Deduction for classroom expenses. Guess what!?! Teachers can still deduct money purchased for school supplies from their taxable income. \n\n**CHANGES THAT HURT THE RICH**\n\n* SALT Deductions capped at 10k. Apparently libs think that people in poverty pay over 10k in state income taxes. \n\n* Mortgage interest deductions capped on mortgages worth 750k. You know... all those poor people with over 750k in mortgage debt will take a hit. And NOTE, that this is for a mortgage of 750k... not the value of a home. I've seen libs complaining about this. Libs who apparently never owned property and dont realize that you must make a sizable down payment when purchasing a home. \n\n\n**BUT WAIT, BUSINESSES ARE GETTING A CUT TOO**\n\n\n* Work hard. Stop crying about tax cuts. Your employer is gonna give you a raise. \n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"QUICK SUMMARY OF GOP TAX BILL"}

{"author":"LibertyTerp","created_utc":1513791869,"num_comments":6,"score":9,"selftext":"Until 1974, presidents were allowed to spend less money than Congress approved for a program. Unlike most presidential powers, this power, called [\"impoundment\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impoundment_of_appropriated_funds), allowed presidents to actually save taxpayers money on unnecessary spending.\n\nFirst used by Thomas Jefferson, impoundment has been used frequently by presidents since.\n\nThe only real downside to granting presidents this authority again is that they might use it to ignore the will of Congress. For example, a Democrat could refuse to spend money on military jets or a Republican could refuse to spend money on wind energy subsidies.\n\nIn order to mitigate this concern while still saving taxpayers' money, I propose that the president should be allowed to send taxpayers a refund of up to 1/4 of any programs' cost.\n\nThis refund would be allocated at the presidents' discretion, as long as no American gets a refund larger than their income tax bill. I imagine Democratic presidents would tend to send the money in equal amounts, while Republican presidents might use it to lower tax rates across the board.\n\nThis law could only lead to less government spending. And it would provide a tremendous incentive for the federal government to be run more efficiently.\n\nIt would also allow the president to eliminate pork barrel projects that make no sense, from bridges to nowhere to military bases the military doesn't want.\n\nEvery president would want to send as big of a refund check to Americans as possible. After one president sends Americans thousands of dollars of refunds throughout his term, the next will feel obligated to do the same, or else risk a backlash.\n\nEvery year around April a big topic of conversation would be how much money taxpayers are getting back because the president didn't spend it all. It would be an important factor in determining the presidents' job approval.\n\nSo what do you think? Would you support allowing presidents not to spend up to 1/4 of allocated funds?","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Allow Presidents to Spend Less Money"}

Though they apparently laid off 600 workers right after. I read into it because I was disappointed, it seems like they are going to move them to different departments if they can. Since the workers they laid off were in areas where their departments were in decline, while in other places increasing. They plan to hire in MO for example 1000 workers (around there), since they see an increase. So idk if it's laid off, or if they are going to move them to different departments to work. It seems like they were talking like that, but only time will tell. \n\n**Fifth Third Bancorp** - $1000 bonuses to 13,500 employees and set a $15 minimum wage.\n\n**Wells Fargo** - Raised minimum wage from $13.50 to $15. \n\n**Boeing** - Investing additional $300 million for job-training, facility upgrades, and charitable giving in the next year. \n\n**Washington Federal** - 5% merit increase to all employees earning less than $100,000 annually, and will be investing in employee training and technology upgrades (they didn't say how much yet).

From what I read the only employees who won't get the bonus are people who already get performance-based bonuses. They said they will be investing more in 2018. \n\n**Rush Enterprise** - $1000 bonus to all employees. \n\n**Associated Bank** - $15 minimum wage to workers from $10, and a $500 bonus to all hourly non-commissioned employees.

Georgia Power also got a nuclear plant go-ahead yesterday.**\n\nIf I'm missing any at all, tell me and link me the news link (can be local as long as you have a source!) so I can add them! If you do not want to comment, or are banned from this subreddit, you can PM me so I can add them. I'm nice promise! \n\nAlso the company has to say it's because of the tax bill.

{"author":"JohnSemmens","created_utc":1514004421,"num_comments":1,"score":1,"selftext":"Dems Appalled by Corporate Response to Tax Cut Bill\n\nThis week, Congress passed and President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The measure reduces taxes on corporations from 35% to 21% and on 80% of taxpaying individuals by smaller percentages. Democratic rhetoric attacking the the legislation predicted a \"massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich\" that would lead to \"Armageddon\" and \"the end of the world.\"\n\nContrary to these predictions, the immediate response by numerous corporations was to announce widespread employee bonuses and plans for substantial increases in investment and hiring. AT&amp;T says it will pay $1,000 bonuses to 200,000 employees. Wells Fargo said it will raise its minimum wage to $15 an hour, and make $400 million in donations to community and nonprofit organizations next year. Boeing, Fifth Third Bancorp, and Comcast each announced additional investments.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) labeled these actions \"an unfair exploitation of a socially unjust law for purely political gain. The notion that private companies should be the ones deciding whether employees get raises or bonuses rejects everything the President Obama was trying to achieve. And the idea that corporations should be the ones determining how much to invest or whether to make charitable contributions is anti-democratic.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY) called the legislation \"fundamentally unfair. The 50% of Americans who currently have no jobs and pay no income taxes get nothing from this bill. It is a thinly veiled trick to try to compel those who are not in the workforce to give up their free time and get jobs if they want to get a tax cut or corporate bonus. This stinks. The GOP will pay dearly at the polls next November for this cruel tyranny over the most vulnerable segments of society.\"\n\nPuerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 contends that \"the money this bill gives to corporations and taxpayers is the rightful property of the poor. And none are poorer than Puerto Ricans. Our island is bankrupt and in greater need of these scarce resources than the businesses and individuals who worked to produce them.\" Rossell\u00f3 vowed to \"mobilize every Puerto Rican voter to elect the kind of representatives and senators who can be counted on to expropriate the profiteers and redirect money to support programs that benefit the poorest among us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, New Jersey Governor-Elect Phil Murphy (D) says \"the legislation is unconstitutional because parts of it are hand-written.\" The irony, of course, is that the original Constitution itself is entirely hand-written.\n\nIn related news, Bureau of Labor statistics showing the lowest unemployment rate for Blacks in 17 years and the lowest ever for Hispanics greatly dismayed Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-NM) characterized it as \"just more evidence of the complete failure of the Trump Administration to solve the nation's economic problems. Minorities that previously got along without having to endure wage-slavery were herded into the rat-race by Trump's maniacal destruction of unnecessary regulations. We are clearly headed for dark times in this country if we don't take the necessary action to neutralize this enemy of freedom.\"\n\nEvidence of Presidential Obstruction of Justice\n\nAccording to a report published by Politico, former President Obama blocked the Drug Enforcement Agency's efforts to stop the Islamic terrorist group Hezbollah from developing a global narcotics syndicate. The nominal rationale for this intrusion to thwart a law enforcement operation was \"to not upset delicate negotiations with Iran.\" Hezbollah is largely funded by the Iranian government.\n\nBen Rhodes, former Deputy National Security Adviser during the Obama Administration, characterized the revelation as \"Monday-morning 'quarterbacking.' Are we supposed to be shocked that a president might place a higher priority on reaching a diplomatic agreement with another country ahead of a routine and less important criminal case? Is the relationship between Hezbollah and Iran really our concern? I mean, it's not as if a successful prosecution of Hezbollah's drug smuggling would have solved the drug problem in this country.\"\n\nTrita Parsi, president of the National Iranian-American council, questioned \"the presumed link between President Obama's quashing of the drug investigation and the negotiations with Iran. Just because the Iranian government funds Hezbollah doesn't mean that it could not be trusted to adhere to whatever agreement was worked out regarding its nuclear program. The sums the US government was willing to pay Iran for the agreement far exceeded the potential profits from drug smuggling. The President could've had other valid reasons for stopping the investigation.\"\n\nFormer Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf insisted that \"any claim that President Obama would ever try to obstruct justice is incomprehensible. His commitment to social justice was far ahead of any of his predecessors. My best guess is that he might have wanted to shut down the DEA investigation because he believed that Hezbollah was driven to crime and terrorism by discriminatory hiring practices in this country. I would be willing to bet that subsequent to his intervention many of the members of Hezbollah were given jobs somewhere within his Administration.\"\n\nRep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) were not impressed by these efforts to exonerate the former president. \"Regardless of whether one considers the agreement with Iran on its nuclear program a good or a bad idea, I don't see how letting a criminal gang of drug smugglers off the hook could have been crucial or necessary,\" Jordan said. \"If Iran was making that a condition for obtaining its agreement I think that would be a pretty big 'red flag' that they couldn't be trusted. If it wasn't a condition we have to ask ourselves what reason could the President have had for butting into what ought to have been a normal law enforcement activity?\"\n\nIn related news, Rhodes tweeted \"I look forward to the day when I can read a Post story on Trump's indictment and then flip to the obits page to see that Ryan, McConnell, and Pence have checked out.\"\n\nNew Developments Further Discredit Trump Dossier\n\nIn private testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe couldn't remember anything about the dossier or where it came from. Neither could he recall ever having discussions with Strzok or Page on the topic of the election or Trump.\n\nChristopher Steele, the former British spy who previously asserted that his dossier proved there was collusion, now says that \"the limited intelligence I have only indicates that such collusion may have been possible. Obviously, given the communication technology available today it's possible that everyone has the means to collude with anyone who has a phone or a computer. Since both Putin and Trump have access to both we can't definitively say that they didn't collude.\"\n\nMary Jacoby, wife of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, bragged about her husband's \"creativity\" and proudly claimed that \"the whole Russia collusion story wouldn't have ever existed if it were not for my husbands efforts.\" The \"efforts\" seem to have mostly entailed rehashing a gossip piece that Simpson and Jacoby wrote for the Wall Street Journal ten years ago.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif) dismissed the possibility that the accusations of collusion between Trump and Russia could be undermined by these developments, saying \"the seriousness of the charges is what ought to concern every American. Until someone proves there was no collusion we must proceed on the assumption that there was. Practically everyone I talk too is convinced that there is something suspicious about Trump's election. Every poll showed him losing big time. The only logical explanation is some sort of dirty trick. I have no doubt that such a thing could have taken place. It's too risky for us to allow a devious and dangerous man like Trump to ride roughshod over the rights of the American people on the flimsy pretext that he is innocent until proven guilty.\"\n\nUN Rebukes US for Embassy Move\n\nFirst, the United Nations Security Council voted 14-1 to rebuke the United States for its decision to move the US Embassy to Israel's capital in Jerusalem. Later, the UN General Assembly voted 128-9 to condemn the US decision. Voting with the US were Guatemala, Honduras, Israel, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, and Togo. Major US allies like Britain, France, Germany and Japan voted against the US.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel explained that \"seventy-five years ago Britain, France, Russia, and the United States ganged up on Germany. Now the shoe is on the other foot. Let's see how Mr. Trump likes that.\"\n\nPalestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki said the UN \"passed an unprecedented test. History will remember those who stand by what is right. With the whole world aligned against the Zionist occupiers and their Satanic ally the day will soon come when a final solution to the Jewish problem can be accomplished.\"\n\nNikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the UN, was undaunted by the the UN's action. \"Each nation chooses its own capital,\" Haley declared. \"There is no moral basis for denying Israel this prerogative. Neither is there one for denying the United States the prerogative to respond as we see fit. The unseemly alliance of the anti-Semitic states who would evict every Jew from Israel and the effete Europeans who would acquiesce in such an injustice will not overrule our own best judgment.\"\n\nFor his part, President Trump welcomed \"the unmasking of these ingrates. Not so long ago Europe was overrun by Nazi invaders. Then the United States did the right thing and came to their aid. Israel is surrounded and besieged by enemies. Now we are coming to their aid. If this displeases the UN\u2014well, we can save a lot of money if we stop subsidizing them.\"\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif assailed Trump's stance as \"a demonstration of his contempt for democracy. The representatives of the vast majority of the people of the world freely voted to condemn the United States for its attempt to impede the elimination of Israel. For Trump to use financial extortion to try to influence us is tyrannical. He has no right to withhold the wealth that rightfully belongs to everyone for any reason, much less as an inducement for us to reject Allah's command to rid the Earth of unbelievers, especially Jews.\"\n\nIn related news, in Illinois, Cook County commissioner Richard Boykin has asked the UN to send peacekeeping troops to Chicago to help quell the gun violence that continues to set new records for fatalities. Pointing out that \"most of the victims are blacks killed by other blacks,\" Boykin maintains that \"our mostly white police force doesn't have the kind of ethnic understanding required. If we can get African troops to patrol our streets I think the outcomes will improve.\"\n\nEthical Confusion at the University Level\n\nOsaka University's Kazue Muta alleges that the princes in Snow White and Sleeping Beauty were guilty of sexual assault. \"Stories about kissing a comatose person without her permission promote sexual violence,\" Muta said. \"This is the wrong message for children to hear. These men had no right to force themselves on these women. A better lesson would be a story where these men respect the women's right to be left alone.\"\n\nThe University of California San Diego is weighing whether to impose disciplinary sanctions on Gregory Lu, a student who who put up posters of Kate Steinle (the young woman shot to death in 2015 by Jose Inez Garcia Zarate--an illegal immigrant) with the caption \"she had dreams too.\" Che Lopez, an investigator with the University's Office for the Prevention of Harassment &amp; Discrimination, called the poster \"possibly a 'hate crime.' Let's not forget that Mr. Garcia is a member of a legally protected racial minority.\" At the same time, Lopez declined to even look for the students who tore down and ripped up the posters because \"we can't suppress freedom of speech.\"\n\nIn related news, the University of California Los Angeles hosted a \"Muslim American Workshop\" where participants proposed policy suggestions that would help Muslim Americans. Among the suggestions were \"banning anti-sharia laws\" and \"eliminating First Amendment protections against hate speech.\" One participant explained that \"Muslims won't truly be free in this country until they can live under their own laws and prevent unbelievers from openly criticizing them.\"\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: December 24, 2017 Edition"}

Although I prefer Trump over Hillary, I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to vote for him. His tactics during the campaign turned me off although he was hilarious. \n\nHowever, I noticed soon after his winning the election, the market hit record numbers. Perhaps for the first time in a long time, businesses felt like they had somebody they can trust and have faith in; as confidence is a huge part of bull economy. \n\nBut again I really didn\u2019t hear much from the media, but negative stories about Trumps personal behavior and tweets. \n\nThe economy continued to boom throughout the year. Yet, we still hear nothing, but negative stories from much of mainstream media except for Fox News, which I admit drives me a bit crazy myself. \n\nSo realizing that I wasn\u2019t going to get much unbiased news from the media, I really tried to pay attention to his accomplishments. They are pretty staggering.  In the first year alone:\n\n1. Illegal immigration across the Mexican border is down to its lowest numbers since 1971. No wall even needed. He just had to threaten to build one. \n\n2. Just cut a large amount of funding to the UN which is pretty much rent-a-cops in war zones. \n\n3. Economy is booming, putting up record numbers \n\n4. ISIS is done in Iraq...for now \n\n5. Reformed tax plan with cuts across the board\n\n6.  Appointees approved quickly \n\n7.  Quick and adiquette response to natural disasters (hurricanes), except for Peruto Rico. However, they were a step behind before the hurricane even hit, so it\u2019s going to take longer to get them up and running. \n\n8. Out of the Paris Climate agreement leveling the playing field a bit for US businesses\n\nWhile Trump may not be directly responsible  for all of these accomplishments, he is responsible for some and didn\u2019t stand in the way of others. \n\nYet, all we hear about are his \u201cmean tweets\u201d and his personal behavior.  Whaaaaaaa!  He\u2019s mean. Whaaaaaaaa!  \n\nTrump is killing it so far.  Can we even name another president that has accomplished so much in his first year?

{"author":"MatthanLewis","created_utc":1514516119,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"I have written this Research paper about illegal immigration. Constructive criticism is welcome, but comments like \"This sucks, die fag.\" will not be responded to. I hope you all enjoy it. It has been broken up into 8 parts. Please keep note while reading this that this is my first research paper.\n\nAlso, please keep in mind that I am in high school, so I have no experience with writing an academic paper. So be easy for me, please.\n\nIllegal immigration to the U.S. poses an existential threat. For this is no exaggeration. If we continue to let illegal immigrants come into our country, we could face a national crisis that the U.S. has not yet seen. To put it simply, millions of illegal immigrants are in the U.S. right now, spreading diseases, committing crimes, and forcing the U.S. to pay the bill of hundreds of billions of dollars a year. I have divided this paper into 10 sections. These sections are in order. They go as follows, Population, Disease, Crime, Economics, Welfare, Terrorism, Protection against Deportation, a case against the so-called \u201cHumanitarian Borders\u201d, and Legalization.\n\nPopulation:\n\nWhen I said that millions of illegal immigrants were in the U.S. I was not exaggerating.\u00a0Pew Research Institute estimates in 2014, 11.2 million illegal immigrants were in the U.S. This is roughly 3-5% of the population. But it gets much worse. In 2016, the U.S. Census Bureau did their Current Population Survey, and they found that immigrants and their U.S. born children are now approximately 84.3 million, or 27% of the overall population. Out of that 27%, 59% of the immigrants are Hispanics. We do some basic math, and it comes out to 49,737 of the 84.3 million immigrants and their U.S. born children are Hispanics.\nOut of the 50 states, there are 5 that have 59% of all illegal immigrants. They are California; Texas; Arizona; New York; New Jersey; and Illinois. Out of all Illegal immigrants, 66% of them have lived in the U.S. for 10 years or more. Again, using some basic math, we see that a total of 55,638 of illegals have lived here for over 10 years. In 2014, nearly 10,000 children not accompanied by their parents crossed our southern border every month. That's 120,000 children a year. In an ITV broadcast covering the southern border, in a span of minutes, 7 illegal immigrants get caught by border patrol agents. This happens every day. With this information, we can see that illegal immigration is alive and well in the United States.\n\nDisease:\n\nDiseases are rampant in America, part of the reason is for the giant surge of illegal immigration. According to the U.S. Department of Helth and Human Services, there are 200 to 250 new cases of Leprosy and Hansen's Disease every year. That is more than 4 cases every week. In 2006, the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report about reported cases of leprosy, \"...peaked at 361 in 1985 and has declined since 1988.\".\n\nIf we read some quotes form health officials and border patrol agents, you will quickly see the bigger problem. On a report by Martha MacCallum on Fox news, Voce President of the Border Patrol Union, and the Rio Grande rep told Ms. MacCallum, \"...The border patrol is trying to play catch up and we\u2019re having a lot of diseases coming in and some we haven\u2019t seen in decades and we are worried they\u2019ll spread throughout the United States especially if they are being released and have the disease.\u201d Also, \u201c...U.S. Border Patrol agents are worried that what\u2019s coming over into the U.S. could harm everyone. This time the focus is not on the women and children that are crossing over in droves. Agents are worrying about a viral outbreak. We are sending people everywhere. The average person doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on down here,\u201d \u201cOur Border Patrol agents check on us all the time and they told us about the outbreak of scabies, We are starting to see chicken pox, MRSA staph infections, we are starting to see different viruses,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s contagious, (The diseases). We are transporting people to different parts of the state and different parts of the country,\u201d So, diseases are coming over from Mexico, that is highly contagious, and the Main-Stream Media pretends that nothing is wrong.\n\nOn a report from the Blaze, Border patrol Agents said, \u201cPoverty and the lack of advanced health care in Central America have heightened concerns among law enforcement and medical professionals about the kinds of sickness the surge of illegal immigrants crossing the southern U.S. border could be bringing with them.\u201d Said medical professionals told the Blaze, \u201cWe have no real way to stop at the border, and we have no idea health-wise what diseases are coming across.\u201d Also, \u201cThere\u2019s no real medical screening either. Basically if [an illegal immigrant] tells a Border Patrol agent or law enforcement official they feel sick, or if they look sick, then they\u2019re checked. If they don\u2019t say anything, that\u2019s it, they\u2019re cleared.\u201d He continued with, \u201cand if you were feeling sick if you were illegal, would you tell anyone? They\u2019ve sent children and families all across the country without medical health screenings.\u201d Then, He concluded with, \u201c(The federal government) needs to realize there is a potential for a public health disaster,\u201d He is correct. The federal government does indeed need to recognize the potential for a public health disaster.\n\nKenneth Wolfe, Deputy Director at the U.S. Department for Health and Human Services spoke to the Blaze, where this was said, \u201cThey are given a well-child exam and given all needed childhood vaccinations to protect against communicable diseases and screened for tuberculosis, \u201c He continued with, \u201cIf children are determined to have any communicable disease or have been exposed to a communicable disease, they are placed in a program or facility that has the capacity to quarantine. If they have mental health problems, they are similarly placed in a specialized facility to meet their needs and not in a temporary shelter.\u201d A border patrol agent from the Rio Grande sector said, \u201cThis is a failure of Health and Human Services and the federal government who knew this was coming and didn\u2019t care to prepare for it or didn\u2019t want to,\u201d He went on by saying, \u201cWe are doing our job but the federal government is failing to do theirs.\u201c\n\nA border patrol agent named, Albert Spratte said, \u201cThe numbers keep growing,\u201d He continued with, \"It's not slowing down. We're concerned about the health of our employees, their families, and Americans. Of course, we're concerned about the health of those who are crossing over, but our resources are stretched so thin we just can't keep up.\" So, as a recap, we have millions of illegal immigrants coming over the border, carrying diseases, that are highly contagious, and are spreading to the border patrol agents who are forced to take care of them, then we have the Main-Stream Media and the federal government pretending there is nothing wrong. Sounds like a \"Public Health Disaster\" to me.\n\nCrime:\n\nIllegal immigration is not bad disastrous for disease-related causes, but also for criminal related causes. A report from the Federal Government Oversight Judicial Watch in 2014 estimates that 50% of all violent crimes are done by the southern border. It is estimated that 40% of the violent crimes were done in court districts along the southern border. The 4 states with these court districts are Texas, California, New Mexico, and Arizona. Texas' western court district, with 6,300 cases filed in 2014. Texas' southern court district, with over 6,000 cases filed in 2014. California's southern court district, with 4,900 cases filed in 2014. The New Mexico's southern court district, with The 4,00 cases filed in 2014. followed by the southern court of Arizona's southern court district, with 3,500 cases filed. Counting all these up, we get, 24,700 cases filed, just in the southern court districts about these 4 states.\nAlso, according to the Department of Justice, 19% of these 24,700 cases were for violent crimes, and 22% for drug crimes.\n\nThis is just on the surface. The U.S. Sentencing Commission reported that 75% of all drug possession crimes were done by illegals in 2015. 30% of all kidnapping and hostage-taking was done by illegals in 2015. 18% of all drug trafficking crimes were done by illegals in 2015. 10% of all money laundering crimes were done by illegals in 2015. 21% of all national defense crimes were done by illegals in 2015. And 5% of all murders were done by illegals in 2015.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Sentencing Commission, that as of 2014, illegals were convicted and sentenced to 13% of all violent crimes. To find out how many crimes this is, we need to find the total number of all violent crimes. According to a 2014 report from the F.B.I, a total of 1,165,383 violent crimes were committed in 2014. So, we do some basic math, and we find that 151,499 of all violent crimes were done by illegal immigrants. According to vetted statistics, illegals are three times more likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans. In California, the rate of illegals per citizen or legal non-citizen immigrant is 92 illegals per 100,000 prisoners, compared to 74 native-born citizens or legal non-citizen immigrant per 100,000 prisoners. In Arizona, the rate is 69 illegals per 100,000 prisoners, compared to 54 native-born citizens or legal non-citizen immigrants per 100,000 prisoners. In New York, the rate is 169 illegals per 100,000 prisoners, compared to 48 native-born citizens or legal non-citizen immigrants per 100,000 prisoners. However, in Texas, the rate is 55 illegals per 100,000 prisoners, compared to 68 native-born citizens or legal non-citizen immigrants per 100,000 prisoners. Likewise, in Florida, the rate is 55 illegals per 100,000 prisoners, compared to 65 native-born citizens or legal non-citizen immigrants. However, I think I can explain the last two. According to an estimate for July of 2017, Texas is the Second most populated state in the U.S. With over 29,000,000 people. So, with more people, come more crime, no matter how you look at it. Same goes for Florida, it is the third most populated state in the U.S. With over 20,000,000 people.\n\nHowever, we still aren't done yet. A joint report from the Department of Homeland Security and Texas Law enforcement found that, between June of 2011, and March of 2017, over 217,000 criminal immigrants were arrested for putting into Texas prisons. In researching the crimes of these criminal immigrants, it was found that over 600,000 crimes were committed. That's more than 2 crimes a criminal immigrant. These 600,000 crimes included: 1,200 homicides, 69,000 assaults, 16,854 burglaries, 6,200 sexual assaults, 700 kidnappings, 69,000 drug offenses, 8,700 weapon violations, 3,800 robberies,\u00a045,000 abstracting police charges. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed that 66% of these criminal immigrants were in our country illegally at the time of their arrest.\nWhile all this is rather compelling, we are not done yet. According to Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported that they, themselves released 36,000 illegal immigrants awaiting deportation proceedings, by the order of the Obama Administration. Out of these 36,000 illegals, they jointly committed over 88,000 crimes. Including, 193 homicide convictions, 426 sexual assault convictions, 303 kidnapping convictions, 1,075 aggravated assault convictions, 1,160 stolen vehicle convictions, 9,187 dangerous drug convictions, 16,070 drunk or drugged driving convictions, and 303 flight escape convictions. The full list of convictions will be up on the screen right now.\n\nMr. Hans Spakovsky, a columnist at the Heritage Foundation, in a column entitled\u00a0\u201cHow Sanctuary Policies Have Directly Led to Thousands of Crimes Against Americans\u201d He lays out what happened. \u201c...in the fiscal year 2013, the Obama administration released over 36,000 convicted criminal aliens awaiting the outcome of deportation hearings upon an unsuspecting public, and another 30,558 in the fiscal year 2014 according to the House Judiciary Committee.\u201d He continues with,\u00a0\u201cThe offenses\u00a0for which\u00a0they were convicted involved \u2018dangerous drugs, assault and domestic violence, stolen vehicles, robbery, sex offenses, sexual assault, kidnapping, voluntary manslaughter, and even homicide.' As the House Judiciary Committee outlined, more than a quarter of these aliens \u2018were so-called \u2018level 1s' according to the administration\u2014the worst of the worst.' And in 2013 alone, the administration didn't even bring removal proceedings against an additional 68,000 criminal aliens convicted of everything from homicide to sexual assault.\u00a0\u201c He concludes with \u201cIf the over 134,000 aliens released by the\u00a0administration in just the past two years follow the pattern of those aliens studied by the GAO in 2005, they will commit hundreds of thousands of more crimes, victimizing countless innocent Americans in crimes that could have been prevented.\u201d When I said that illegal immigration posed an existential threat, I wasn't kidding.\n\nEconomics:\n\nThe economics of illegal immigration is often nuanced, and it is easy to see why. Many different studies say that there is a big economic growth with the implementation of illegals into the workforce, as well as with taxes, but in actuality, there is a big economic cost, that far overshadows the benefit. First, let\u2019s look at the claims that there is an economic increase. According to a report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy,\u00a0\u201cthe best evidence suggests that at least 50 percent of undocumented immigrant households currently file income tax returns using Individual Tax Identification Numbers (ITINs), and many who do not file income tax returns still have taxes deducted from their paychecks.\u201d And, according to a report from the American Immigration Council, \u201cThe end result is that undocumented immigrants are paying billions of dollars each year in taxes. Moreover, as several studies have found, undocumented immigrants would earn much more, and therefore pay much more in taxes, if they had some sort of legal status, be it permanent or temporary. Not surprisingly, permanent status yields more tax revenue than temporary status.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Institute on Taxation Economic Policy, Illegals paid $11.6 billion in taxes in 2013. This includes $7.1 billion in sales tax, $1.1 billion in income tax, and $3.6 billion in property tax. In each state, taxes ranged from $2.2 million in Montana to $3.1 billion in California. According to the American Immigration Council, the six states that received the most taxes form illegals were Florida, California, Illinois, New York, Texas, and New Jersey. According to a report from the American Immigration Council, \"In 2013, the average effective state and local tax rate of undocumented immigrants-----that is, the share of their total income which they paid in taxes-----was 8 percent, compared to 5.4 percent for the top 1 percent of all taxpayers.\" Also, according to the Federation for American Immigration Reform, the total tax contributions for by illegals is up to approximately $19 billion dollars, with approximately $15 billion of the dollars are from federal taxes and approximately 4 billion for state and local taxes.\n\nThis seems like a pretty good case for economic growth, billions of dollars in taxes going back to the government. But there\u2019s a catch, These illegals are costing taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. According to the Department of justice and the Department of Homeland Security, taxpayers are paying over $19 billion dollars in taxes every day going to house and care for 300,000 to 450,000 convicted criminal immigrants, who can be deported but are currently living in jails and prisons. Keep in mind though, that these numbers include illegal and legal immigrants convicted of crimes. Adding up the $19 billion dollars a day, we get $6 billion dollars a year. Accounting estimates that the total cost for all medical and support services for adults and minors are over $1.8 billion dollars. Other accounting estimates that the total cost is up to 17 billion dollars a year. According to a report from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, American taxpayers pay up to 40 billion on education for illegals and/or their children. From the same report from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, Illegals are costing American taxpayers approximately $46 billion dollars in state and local taxes, and approximately $89 billion dollars a year in federal taxes, adding that up to a grand total of $135 billion in American taxpayers costs. If we subtract the tax contribution from the tax cost, which equals 1.17 times 10 to the 11th\u00a0power, or, 1.17 times 100 billion, which then equals out to 117 billion dollars taxpayers are paying for every single year. And liberals claim we have no problem.\n\nWelfare:\n\nSo far, I have made a case against illegals ONLY, however, If this section, legal immigrants are also to blame. The reason is that even though the illegals are still higher on welfare than legal immigrants, legal immigrants are still causing a problem. First, let's look at illegals impact on welfare. According to a report from the Center for Immigration Studies, \"\u2026Turning to households headed by immigrants in the country illegally, we estimate that 62 percent used one or more welfare programs in 2012, compared to 30 percent of native households.\" Also, \"Households headed by immigrants illegally in the country have higher use rates than native households overall and for food programs (57 percent vs. 22 percent) and Medicaid (51 percent vs. 23 percent). Use of cash programs by illegal immigrants is lower than used by natives (5 percent vs. 10 percent), as is a use of housing programs (4 percent vs. 6 percent).\" According to the same report from the Center for Immigration Studies, the main way that illegals are getting this welfare is from their native-born children, who, according to the same report, 87% of illegal households have. 86% of the 87% of illegal households are using one or more welfare programs, compared to 52% of native-born households. Furthermore, a chart form the Center for immigration studies shows that, 57% of illegals use food stamps, compared to 22% of native-born households, 51% of illegal households on Medicaid, compared to 23% of the native population, surprisingly, 10% of native-born are on cash welfare, whereas, only 5% of illegals are on cash welfare, and 6% of native-born are on housing, whereas, 4% of illegals are on housing benefits. After looking at illegals in general, let's divide them into groups according to their school status. 77% of illegals on welfare have not completed high school, compared to 59% of native-born on welfare, 62% of illegals on welfare have completed high school only, compared to 39% of native-born, 50% of illegals on welfare have completed some college, compared to 33% of native-born with some college, and 18% on welfare with bachelors, compared to 13% of native-born.\n\nOkay, now that we have the illegals out of the way for this section, let's look at the status of welfare for LEGAL immigrants now. According to the Center for immigration studies, 49% of legal immigrants are on any welfare. Of that 49%, 36% are on food stamps, 39% of legal households on Medicaid, 14% on cash welfare, and 7% on Housing Benefits. Even if we look at education, legal immigrants on welfare, 75% have not completed high school, 39% that have completed high school only, 46% of legal with some college, and 26% of legal with a bachelors degree. Know that this section is over, we have 5 more sections left.\n\nTerrorism:\n\nWhen you think of terrorism, you don't usually think of illegal immigration, but you really should. A report from the 2011 Senate Homeland Security Committee found that the Canadian Border is \" \"An easy passage into America's for; terrorists, extremists, and criminals whose purpose is clearly to harm the American people.\" In July of 2014, John Kelly, Marine Corps general, and U.S. southern border command said that the southern border has become a \"crime-terror convergence.\" and, \"All this corruption and is directly or indirectly due to insatiable U.S. demand for drugs, particularly Cocaine, heroin, and now meth. All of which are produced in Latin America and smuggled into the U.S. through an incredibly efficient network along which anything, hundreds of tons of drugs, people, terrorists, or children, so long as they pay the fare.\u201d Now, to be fair, drugs trafficking is not terrorism, unless it is done for the explicit purpose, as to weaken America, then it can be considered a terrorist attack. But let's move on. According to an article at the Washington Times, written by, James A. Lyons, Retired Admiral, Former Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Fleet, and Senior US Military Representative to the United Nations, who, in the article stated, \"It is an acknowledged fact that since we have refused to secure our borders, we have facilitated the transit and infiltration of al Qaeda affiliated terrorists and\u00a0narco-terrorists who are now living illegally in the United States. This is a serious national security issue, as manifested by the Boston Marathon bombing\u2026\u201d He continued \u201cFixing our porous borders is one of combating the threat of terrorism that America faces. Any immigration bill must have enforceable border-security measures as a key national security element in protecting our country.\u201d A few more quotes, then we will be done with this section. In 2006,\u00a0Charles\u00a0Stewart Verdery Jr.\u00a0JD, Former Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security, in a testimony to the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security and Citizenship, where he stated, \"Most such migrants [illegal aliens] are gainfully employed here, pay taxes, and many have started families and developed roots in our society... But others seeking to cross our borders illegally do present a threat \u2013 including potential terrorists and criminals. The current flow of illegal immigrants and people overstaying their visas has made it extremely difficult for our border and interior enforcement agencies to be able to focus on the terrorists, organized criminals, and violent felons who use the cloak of anonymity that the current chaotic situation offers.\" In 2007, Dan Stein, JD, President of Federation for American Immigration Reform, in an article stated, \"Today we found out once again that our failure to control illegal immigration and our inability to manage the current caseload of people applying for immigration benefits poses a lethal risk to the nation... terrorists can and will take advantage of the same unenforced immigration policies that have flooded this country with illegal immigrants - we now have irrefutable proof that the terrorists understand where we are vulnerable. We can be certain that there are many more terrorists who entered the country illegally or overstayed visas.\" Remember this, a\"crime-terror convergence.\u201d.\n\nProtection against Deportation:\n\nIn this section, I will be covering the liberal agenda to destroy America, by keeping the illegal immigrants in the country. In 2014, the governor of California signed a bill that maximum sentencing for misdemeanors, form 365 days, to 364 days. An article from The Hill summarizes it with this, \"his was deliberately done to avoid current federal laws that provide for the deportation of illegal and legal immigrants in this country who have received sentences of 365 days or more.\u201d He continues with \"With the newly enacted jail and prison diversion programs of Propositions 109 and 47, Gov. Brown and company are effectively preventing the federal government from removing violent and recidivist illegal immigrants from our midst through the deportation process.\" Over the past three years, 100,000 or more illegals should have been deported by the Obama Administration, but instead, were released back into the general population. Yet more evidence that liberals are trying to destroy America. \n\nAccording to an article from the examiner, \"U.S. immigration officials have revealed that they face a deportation backlog of 550,000 illegal immigrants who were given temporary amnesty by former President Obama or simply let off the hook by liberal judges.\u201d \u201cThe massive backlog is being tackled by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but the sheer numbers \u2014 bigger than the populations of Atlanta or Sacramento -- is overwhelming the agency\u2019s enforcement and removal department.\u201d The author continues with, \" This week as ICE and other immigration officials reviewed successes under President Trump, a reporter asked\u00a0Matthew T. Adlece\u00a0executive associate director for enforcement and removal operations, if he knew the number of outstanding deportation orders. The conversation went this way: \n\nAlbence: \u201cBallpark is going to be around 550,000.\u201d\nReporter: \u201cWhoa. Why is it so high?\u201d\nAlbence: \u201cWell for a large part of the last four or five years we\u2019ve been unable to take enforcement action against those individuals.\u201d\nUnder Obama, many deportation actions were delayed starting in 2014,\u201d Albence then continued, \u201cOur officers had to turn their heads and walk the other way. So that\u2019s a large part of that problem, the fact that we couldn\u2019t enforce the law,\u201d Also, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, \"And liberal judges also forgave or protected illegals, even illegal populations like several Iraqi\u2019s in the Detroit area, some sought for murder, according to ICE.\u201d The Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement told the Examiner, \u201cWe need to hold liberal judges accountable,\u201d.\n\nLegalization:\n\nThe two more sections I have for you is the outcome of giving amnesty to and legalizing all the illegal immigrants. According to the American Immigration Council, legalizing all 11 million illegal immigrants will yield the largest tax revenue in U.S. history. Giving legal citizenship, whether temporary or permanent, will let them get better jobs, producing higher income, and higher tax. According to the American Immigration Council, \u201cvirtually all immigrants with legal status pay into the tax system, compared to roughly half of the undocumented. The end result is more tax revenue at all levels of government.\u201d\u00a0According to the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy, stated that if all illegal immigrants had legal status, their state and local tax contributions would be $2.1 billion higher than it is, for a total of $13.8 billion dollars. This includes:\n\n$7.6 billion in sales tax\n$2.2 billion in income tax\n$4 billion in property tax\n\nAccording to the American Immigration Council, \"The largest increases in tax revenue resulting from legalization would be in California, Texas, New York, and Illinois.\" and \"The average effective state and local tax rate of formerly undocumented immigrants granted legal status would rise from 8 to 8.6 percent.\" In 3 years after legalizing, \"The higher earning power of newly legalized workers\u2026would generate $4.5 to $5.4 billion in additional net tax revenue\" According to a study from the North American Integration and Development and the Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, \"This increase in tax revenue stems from the fact that \"all immigrant workers in this scenario have full labor rights, which results in higher wages\u2014and higher worker productivity\u2014for all workers in industries where large numbers of immigrants are employed.\"\n\nHowever, From the Center for Immigration Studies, \u201cThe overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants have modest levels of education; therefore, the high use of welfare associated with less-educated legal immigrants indicates that legalization would likely increase welfare costs, particularly for cash and housing programs.\u201d\nHumanitarian:\nLots of people on the left seek to open the borders, this is predictable. The left has always been the beacons of equality throughout the entire life of the terms \"Left\" and \"right\". Many people on the left call for the open border, but many other people on the left go even further and call for a \"Humanitarian Border\". What is a humanitarian border? Well, a humanitarian border is no different than open borders, except with a moral superiority complex entwined into it. Humanitarians state that the borders should be open because borders seek to divide people by nationality and that humanity would be prosperous if we open our borders. This is not only wrong, it's dangerous. If we open our borders, we will be letting all the disease-infested, criminal, drug dealing humans that wish not to benefit us, but to overrun us. Humanitarians are globalists, who have no interest in helping America, or Americans. If humanitarian truly want to be humanitarians, they can be American-humanitarians. In order to stay strong and prosperous, we cannot let illegal immigrants through our borders to ravage Americans.\nI seek to give a solution. Deport The illegal immigrants that have committed a crime in our country, immediately. give a month to the illegals, that have not committed a crime in our country, so they can get out of the country, voluntarily. If the illegals don't leave within a month, they will be deported forcefully.\n\nA debunking of a Claim:\n\nThere is a huge misconception when looking at things such as crime statistics, and that is the way they are processed. Crime statistics are processed by taking the number of people and dividing that by the number of crimes, and you get your number of crimes. The problem with this is that it can cause lots of confusion. Take this as an example: there are one-hundred people in a room, and ten of them are criminals, the number of criminals is 10% of the total population. Now, if we add 900 people to the original 100 people we get 1000 people in total, but of those new 900 people, 40 of them are criminals. So that's 50 criminals out of 1000 people, making the percentage of criminals, and making it look like crimes, go down, form 10% with 100 people, to 5% with 1000 people, despite the number of criminals in actuality, growing.\n\nSources:\n\nPopulation:\n\nhttp://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/crime/329589-the-truth-about-crime-illegal-immigrants-and-sanctuary-cities\n\nhttps://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states#Mexican\n\nDisease:\n\nhttp://www.theblaze.com/news/2014/06/24/potential-for-a-public-health-disaster-illegal-immigrant-surge-leaves-officials-with-no-idea-which-diseases-are-coming-across\n\nhttp://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/07/08/8-reasons-to-close-the-border-now/\n\nhttps://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2010/getting-immigration-facts-straight\n\nhttp://toprightnews.com/border-agent-diseases-coming-havent-seen-decades-video/\n\nCrime:\n\nhttps://www.judicialwatch.org/blog/2014/08/doj-report-nearly-half-fed-crimes-near-mexican-border/\n\nhttp://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/crime/329589-the-truth-about-crime-illegal-immigrants-and-sanctuary-cities\n\nhttps://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/violent-crime\n\nhttps://cis.org/Report/ICE-Document-Details-36000-Criminal-Alien-Releases-2013\n\nhttps://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/2010-2017/state/totals/nst-est2017-01.xlsx\n\nEconomics:\n\nhttps://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/adding-billions-tax-dollars-paid-undocumented-immigrants\n\nhttp://www.washingtonexaminer.com/record-135-billion-a-year-for-illegal-immigration-average-8075-each-25000-in-ny/article/2635757\n\nhttps://fairus.org/issue/publications-resources/fiscal-burden-illegal-immigration-united-states-taxpayers\n\nWelfare:\n\nhttp://www.nationalreview.com/corner/444543/immigration-welfare-media-misleads-washington-post\n\nhttps://cis.org/sites/default/files/camarota-welfare-illegals_1.pdf\n\nTerrorism:\n\nhttps://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/aug/14/lyons-the-national-security-component-of-immigrati/\n\nhttps://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-109shrg48837/html/CHRG-109shrg48837.htm\n\nhttps://trove.nla.gov.au/work/61819437?q&amp;versionId=74860726\n\nhttp://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/07/08/8-reasons-to-close-the-border-now/\n\nProtection Against Deportation:\n\nhttp://www.washingtonexaminer.com/obama-blocked-deportation-of-550000-illegals-more-than-atlantas-population/article/2642694\n\nhttp://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/crime/329589-the-truth-about-crime-illegal-immigrants-and-sanctuary-cities\n\nHumanitarian:\n\nThere was no statistics or quotes in this section, so I have nothing to add here.\n\nLegalization:\n\nhttps://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/adding-billions-tax-dollars-paid-undocumented-immigrants\n\nThank you for reading.

{"author":"JohnSemmens","created_utc":1514595227,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"CNN Analysts Clash\n\nThis week, CNN legal analyst Paul Callan acknowledged that Republican concerns about the objectivity of the FBI investigating alleged collusion are justified. \"I started out angry at the aspersions being cast upon this venerated law enforcement agency, but the deeper I probed the more substantive the Republican claims became,\" Callan said.\n\n\"Take this FBI agent Peter Strzok,\" Callan began. \"First, there's this trail of texts between him and fellow FBI agent Lisa Page indicating a definite covert scheme during 2016 to undermine the Trump candidacy and an 'insurance plan' to undermine his presidency in the event he wins the election. It turns out that Strzok was instrumental in pushing FBI Director James Comey's decision to exonerate Hillary Clinton for her mishandling of classified emails.\"\n\n\"Then there's the $700,000 in Democratic Party funds paid to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe's wife for her senate campaign,\" Callan continued. \"Clearly, McCabe should have recused himself from any investigation involving Clinton and the Democratic Party, but he didn't. Instead he apparently collaborated with Strzok and Page in their scheme to undermine Trump. These are not the behaviors one should expect from impartial law-enforcement officials.\"\n\nLater on, CNN legal Analyst Michael Zeldin rejected Callan's concerns asserting that \"my colleague has fallen into the web of Republican deception. The job of the FBI is to protect this country from those who would undermine our form of government. It couldn't be clearer from both his campaign rhetoric and his actions as president that Donald Trump is as big a threat as there has ever been in this regard. The actions of Strzok, Page, McCabe, Comey were the actions of patriots willing to step outside the lines of legal impartiality for the greater good. Suggestions by the likes of Rep. Rooney (R-FL) that these heroes should be 'purged' from the FBI for trying to engineer a 'coup d'etat' are the real threat.\"\n\nIn related news, it now appears that Special Counsel Robert Mueller met secretly with former FBI Director Comey prior to his June 2017 testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in which he admitted asking \"a friend\" to illegally leak a memo he wrote \"because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.\" As luck would have it, that leak led to the appointment of his long-time friend Mueller as the Special Counsel.\n\nFirst Year Presidential Approval Ratings for Trump vs. Obama\n\nThe 2017 Rasmussen year-end poll of presidential approval ratings for President Trump of 46% approve vs. 53% disapprove matched those of his 2009 year-end presidential approval poll of President Obama. In polls taken shortly after each man's inauguration, Obama's approval rating was 67% while Trump's was 59%.\n\nConsidering that Trump's first year had to endure an unrelenting barrage of negative media coverage while Obama received relatively little criticism makes the Rasmussen results all the more amazing. According to the Pew Research Center, Obama received 42% positive coverage vs. only 20% negative coverage. In contrast, Trump received only 5% positive coverage vs. 62% negative coverage.\n\nTrump's tweet hailing the latest Rasmussen poll numbers was airily dismissed by CNN: \"Our weighted average of the polling data shows that Secretary Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election by a landslide. This one Rasmussen poll is clearly an outlier with little credibility or connection to reality.\"\n\nNY Gov Says Trump Tax Cut Unconstitutional\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo (D) is weighing a lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Bill on the grounds that \"it has a partisan impact. On paper, the legislation says nothing about political parties. In effect, though, the new law reduces the exemption for state-levied taxes. This hits high-tax states like New York especially hard. Since all the high-tax states are run by Democrats the new law is unfairly discriminatory toward states controlled by Democrats.\"\n\nCuomo brushed aside the suggestion that his state could escape the negative impacts by lowering state taxes, calling it \"a less desirable option. Keeping state taxes low is the Republican way of doing things. Mimicking their policy would derail us from our long-term progress toward shifting the control over the nation's resources out of the hands of selfish individuals and into the unselfish hands of government experts dedicated to social justice. The idea that it is individual people who produce resources through their work and investment is a myth that was convincingly disproved by President Obama when he pointed out that no one builds their own business. Someone else made that happen. That 'someone else' is the government. Using tax policy to try to feed that individualistic fantasy is unfair.\"\n\nEven before the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Bill New York has been losing residents to low-tax states. In the last seven years more than one million people have left the state\u2014making New York the number one state in net out-migration. E.J. McMahon of the Empire Center, a fiscal watchdog group in New York, cited \"lack of economic opportunity upstate and the high cost of living downstate and in New York City. High state and local taxes on income, sales, and property are major contributors to the state's negative economic environment.\"\n\nIn related news, French President Emmanuel Macron has been roundly criticized by his country's left for proposing that unemployment benefits be denied to those who refuse to accept jobs. Under his plan, those who refuse two reasonable job offers or who refuse training will have their benefits halved for two months. Alexis Corbiere of the France Unbowed Party denounced the proposal \"as pure capitalistic exploitation. We socialists have worked hard to free our countrymen of the burdens of wage-slavery. We will resist this backward step with all our might.\" Under the current French unemployment benefit program 9.6% of the working age population has been more or less permanently relieved of the scourge of wage-slavery.\n\nCongresswoman Bumps Passenger\n\nOn a United Airlines flight from Houston to Washington, DC, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex) added another bumped passenger to her growing list. When the passenger complained Jackson labeled her a \"racist.\"\n\nJean-Marie Simon, the woman Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee called a racist, is a photojournalist who helped document human-rights abuses in Guatemala during the 1980s. She currently teaches in a private school and is a registered Democrat.\n\n\"All that stuff about what she did in Guatemala doesn't change the fact that she is white,\" Lee argued. \"All whites are racists. She was probably trying to atone for her whiteness by going to Guatemala. And registering Democrat doesn't mean anything. It was Democrats who manned the firehouses in Selma. It was Democrats who made the Jim Crow laws. It was Democrats who fought the Civil War to defend slavery. The key thing is that she objected to a black woman taking her seat instead of realizing that it was a small reparation for all the suffering her kind inflicted on my kind over the centuries.\"\n\nIn related news, Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei praised Black Lives Matter for \"their heroic opposition to the wanton murder of black men, women, and children\" and urged them \"to join the jihad against the Great Satan who oppresses their people.\"\n\nDiffering Attitudes about Vote Fraud\n\nA study by New York University Professor John Kane, published in the latest Public Opinion Quarterly found that Republicans have different attitudes about vote fraud than Democrats do.\n\n\"The gist of the findings are that Republicans are more concerned with election integrity while Democrats are more concerned with winning,\" Kane said. \"In the battery of survey questions we asked, Republicans consistently came down in favor of integrity regardless of whether this would benefit their Party's candidates. In contrast, Democrats were less interested in integrity if it would mean fewer of their candidates would win.\"\n\nJ. Christian Adams, president of the Public Interest Legal Foundation contends that \"Kane's study understates the difference between the Parties. Democrats aren't just 'less interested' in integrity. They are flat out in favor of winning by whatever means necessary.\"\n\nOne of Kane's Democratic poll respondents appeared to confirm Adams' contention by pointing out that \"strict adherence to majority rule should not impede the transformation to a progressive government. Lenin didn't balk at overthrowing a democratically elected government in order to achieve true socialism. If freely cast ballots stray from the path necessary to accomplish our goals supplementing them with correctly marked ballots is a less bloody method that our reactionary opponents ought to be more thankful we are using.\"\n\nIn related news, in an interview conducted by England's Prince Harry, former President Obama came out strongly against \"the political anarchy spawned by the Internet and social media. It used to be expensive to communicate your message to millions of people. The cost excluded the masses from injecting their opinions into the stream of information. Now any yahoo with a phone and a finger can spout off whenever he wants. We need a way to cull the herd, so to speak, so that there's a more realistic opportunity to develop a universal source of information and opinion. Only then will the common people be united in support of those of us who govern them.\"\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"SEMI-NEWS/SEMI-SATIRE: December 31, 2017 Edition"}
