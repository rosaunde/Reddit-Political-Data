My name is[ Sarah Smith](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Q5Vg89X.jpg) and I am running for Congress in Washington\u2019s 9th District. The 9th is part Seattle, Bellevue, South King County, and the North Port area of Tacoma. I am running with[ Brand New Congress](https:\/\/brandnewcongress.org\/) and am also a[ Justice Democrat](https:\/\/justicedemocrats.com\/) here in Washington fighting for Medicare for All, ending corporate bribery of politicians, debt-free education, and for what we call \u201ckitchen-table\u201d issues. You might've heard of Brand New Congress recently as we're one of the groups who helped Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unseat long term incumbent Joe Crowley in New York's 14th District. We hope to do the same here in Washington.\n\nI\u2019m challenging a 22-year war hawk and slow-to-move incumbent, Adam Smith. Adam has historically voted for the PATRIOT Act, CISPA, and to sell cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia while they bomb innocent civilians. \n\nThe 9th is a district filled with working-class people just like me who face rising rent costs, increasing commute times, rising housing costs, and the burden of student loans. We work hard, we get sick, we\u2019re burdened with debt, and we\u2019re tired of waiting for change.\n\nI'm running because I believe that we have a chance to truly reshape the political landscape for the first time in my life. I've been engaged in activism throughout my life but the thing that makes me most excited is being able to represent people like me. People who've had to work full-time through school, have had to face and experience houselessness, and have experienced trying to make ends-meet in a post-recession America. I have a deep commitment to progressivism and representing working-class issues. I think it\u2019s time we replace longtime lukewarm incumbents with candidates who will bring fire to D.C.\n\nI\u2019m ready for your questions, \/r\/Politics!\n\n==============================================\n\nWant to join our community?

The problem is that many of the people from our side don't know how to respond to that, but it's very easy. Here's a resource I always use from the [GOP Website](https:\/\/gop.com\/a-tale-of-two-countries-canadas-immigration-system-versus-the-us-rsr\/). \n\nIt basically outlines how Canada's system is pretty ruthless and systematic in the way it vets immigrants, while the US system is based on familial reunification. \n\nFor example:\n&gt;In Canada, immigrant admissions based on employment skills accounted for 58 percent of new immigrants in 2017, while U.S. admissions for employment skills accounted for less than 14 percent of lawful permanent resident admissions.\n\nMeanwhile\n&gt;In 2015, 24.09 percent of Canada\u2019s new permanent residents were family-sponsored immigrants, while 64.6 percent of the United States\u2019 new permanent residents were family-sponsored immigrants.\n\nAsk someone on the street however, and they'll expect that the numbers would be flipped. People just don't know that many of the immigrants accepted into  America would have been denied by Canada. Obviously we as a sub think the Canadian system is superior.\n\nBut that's just one fact in the entire article chock full of them.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Immigration A Tale Of Two Countries: Canada\u2019s Immigration System Versus The U.S."}

We neither see Donald Trump as the ultimate conservative who has all the answers nor the death of conservative movement and must be stopped at all costs.  The various mods range from highly supportive of the president to high suspicious of his actions.  \n\nSince I am addressing the subreddit, I will lay my views out on the table.  Trump is a man who runs on instinct and works with those whom he sees as amenable to negotiation.  He has found himself in a situation where the only people in Congress who will work with him are Republicans, so he works with them and stays in their field.  He has a genuine populist view, and I think that both helps and hurts.  He is clearly a dedicated patriot, and wants what's best for America first.  Sometimes that works out great, like supporting the military; sometimes that hurts, like with putative tariffs.  I think he's the best Republican president since Ronald Reagan.  I can remember Ronald Reagan, and I am not nearly ready to put Trump over the Gipper.  These are my views and I don't apologize for them.  I will defend them, but I don't live and die by them.\n\nEveryone needs to tone it down a few notches.  Volatile rhetoric has been turned up to 11, and it needs to stop.  You can have your views, and they are all compatible within the framework of conservatism and \/r\/conservative.  Varying opinions of the president are welcome.  Never Trumpers can criticize the president, and Trump loyalists can defend him.  But leave it at that.\n\nRule 1 is civility.  Your conservatism or your protestations that your views are correct do not make up for violations of the rule.  We have banned conservatives for violations of civility.  We don't like it, but we'll do it.  Mods are watching and participating, and if you cross the line, we will take action.\n\nWe want conservatism to be a great place for conservatives of all varieties to discuss the issues of the day from a distinctly conservative point of view.  We work very hard to keep the leftists at bay for the benefit of our subscribers.  But we need you to do your part.  Don't make personal attacks.  Stick to the facts, and remember that every account has a human being on the other side of the Internet.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to message me.  Thank you for your time.\n\n\/u\/thatrightwinger\n\nMod\n\n**EDIT** - Two quick notes:\n\n1. The other mods thought that I should admit that I posted this wholly on my own without consulting any of the other mods.  None of the other mods have expressed any disagreement, but this hardly qualifies as a \"mod announcement\" if the idea comes from only one of the mods.  This was entirely my own notion and writing.\n\n2. Thanks for the reddit gold: it's always a bonus to see when someone thinks it's worth spending their own money to compliment my work.

{"author":"illicitandcomlicit","created_utc":1533558908,"num_comments":21,"score":23,"selftext":"After nearly a decade and a half of friendship, I no longer believe I can be friends with this person. Some backstory:. I was raised in a fairly liberal state and moved to the south for a job two years ago. I've enjoyed the culture and found southern hospitality to be a real thing. These people have been warm and welcoming to not only me, but people I work with of all ethnicities and all walks of life. Though this this is not my home those I have met have done a wonderful job of making it feel like one.\n\nTL;DR - A friend of 15 years no longer respects my opinions and ideas, hates all things which can be associated with southerners, and has become a close-minded, bigoted progressive, who's more hateful than anyone I've met in the south.\n\nI recently returned to Massachusetts to visit some friends while on vacation and while our political ideals dont align, I feel my friend has become a hateful bigot despite his \"oh so tolerant\" views. I like to talk politics, but I have a hard time when it consists of only demonizing a single side. According to him, everyone who drives a truck is a \"trump fag\" who deserves to be run off the road, a pretty extreme generalization but w\/e. He continues to talk about how the flag is a symbol of white nationalism and that anyone who flies it or has a bumper sticker is also a pro trump nazi.\n\nAt this point (he knows my views) I reiterated to him that he doesn't know these people and his generalizations are annoying and dangerous (as he laughed it off). I then mention my uncle who fought in the gulf war, drives a truck, has an American flag sticker, but is a Democrat. He scoffed at the idea, and quickly changed subjects insinuating I must be lying because it doesn't fit his views and that this is why he needs to move to Canada because it's just so much better than the US in every way. \n\nAfter discussing that point further, he then begins to shit all over the state I live in down south. He's never been south, nor left the confines of Massachusetts but is convinced every white person down there is a KKK member who would burn him at the stake given the chance (he's gay). He continues saying all these people are ignorant backwoods fucks, who like to fuck their sisters and that the more time people spend in the south, the more retarded they become.\n\nAt this point I kind of snapped. I dont take kindly to people insulting everyone and everything they know nothing about. Had he traveled south, I'd consider his views slightly more valid, but he truly believes everyone down there is burning the gays and blacks and I just couldn't even have a conversation with him because he didn't want to hear what I had to say. His mind was already made up and he wasn't open to being  changed. \n\nHe wasn't always like this, and has been in Mass as long as I have been down south. But I think he's completely gone off the deep end, and refuses to believe that anyone or anything that comes from the south is good, suggesting we just seperate from all southern states. When countering of what good comes from the southern states, again he scoffed at the idea. I'm irritated by his ignorance and behavior and feel it's a product of living in Mass. Despite what he thinks of the people in the south, I think it's gone to show me that those people are much nicer, as they haven't instilled the same hatred in me, as those he surrounds himself with. I'm worried this is becoming a more common theme in politics, but just wanted to share my story.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Today I lost my oldest friend"}

The cold hard reality is that women's fertility window is pretty damn short in the grand scheme of things.\n\n----\n\nOld timer advice for the ladies: \n\nWomen who know they want kids and to get married should ideally be doing so in your late teens and early 20s when your bodies can handle it best. However, this would require being chaste in one's teen years, and  combined with the help of family and friends find a good solid dude (will probably be a bit older) to settle down with who can bring home the bacon and lock him in then when you're all in your physical prime (there's a good reason I'll touch on later).\n\nGoing this route ensures the kids are raised at home by the parent(s) rather than some nanny or daycare provider, and the moms will have the energy to chase the kids around the house raising them. And once the kids are off to school, the women are still young enough in their mid-20s to go get that education *and THEN* start their career, all without the huge gap in their experience when women decide to have kids as is so common today.\n\nWhat we've got today is instead of women building families and using their youthful energy to raise kids, they're burning all that energy going out partying enjoying a cavalcade of carousel riding, then trying to pencil in a \"good man\" once they hit the wall and their looks begin to fade, never giving the man they eventually do settle down with their best looking and most fertile years. It's the elephant in the room we're not supposed to talk about and guys are largely getting fed up with the lack of chaste women available to settle down with.\n\nLastly, something I eluded to above that's rarely ever talked about is that it is imperative for women to give their long term partner their best physical years so the men have memories to look back upon with fondness so they are less likely to stray in later years. That's a very real, but often not discussed psychological element at play to giving men LTR satisfaction after the looks have faded.\n\nMost of this is just a reskinned version of this old [blog someone wrote years back](https:\/\/dontmarry.wordpress.com\/2009\/01\/22\/feminisms-terrible-blunder\/), but it's as relevant today as it was nearly 10 years ago when it was written. In fact I'd say things have actually gotten worse since then.\n\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Carrie Underwood drops a red pill; people lose their minds"}

I\u2019m a right-leaning centralist, so I tend to have views on both sides, and often times agree with these news outlets; but when someone says \u201cfeminism is no longer needed\u201d or \u201cBLM is a hate group\u201d (which are 2 things I strongly believe), they are not being alt-right, they just don\u2019t agree with those two things. If anything, I\u2019d think that MOST conservatives would think those things. \n\n\nDespite the lack of alt-right sentiment in these views, many news outlets,(CNN, MSNBC, etc.), repeatedly use the far right as being the main group who hold these views. And this brings in a new problem; if leftist media dismisses such arguments as \u201calt-right\u201d, they are indirectly saying that these views are not worth discussing, effectively silencing the right. \n\n\nThis becomes clear when looking at their target audience; democrats or left-leaning people. Many of them trust these sources to deliver the truth, and will believe what they are told, as, well, it\u2019s the news; their job is to tell the truth, or at least it\u2019s supposed to be. So when these news outlets call these views \u201calt-right\u201d, views that a good amount of people on the LEFT hold as well, they are doing two things. \n\n1. If the viewer does not hold these views, they will likely take away that there is no point in debating these topics, as the only people that hold them are sexist, racist, homophobes. (Which is vastly untrue)\n\n2. If the viewer does in fact hold these views, they are being told that those views are only held by sexist, racist, homophobes, and that they should re-evaluate they\u2019re opinion or be considered a member of the alt-right, bullying them into giving up their beliefs. \n\nBoth of these outcomes are very dangerous, as it eliminates the chance of a discussion. Most people will not agree on everything, but the only way to stay civilized is to discuss, debate, and attempt to understand each other\u2019s views better. Without doing this, our country turns into a political war zone where everyone is calling everyone else racist, sexist, bigot, snowflake, and any other buzzword that can be thrown at the opposing side. This, unfortunately, is what has happened to our country today, and news outlets like CNN and MSNBC are part of the problem. \nThe right is not the Alt-Right, the Left is not the Far-Left, and the ability to sit down and agree to disagree is the only chance that we have to revise this hostile political climate that we are living in now.

I\u2019m a right-leaning centralist, so I tend to have views on both sides, and often times agree with these news outlets; but when someone says \u201cfeminism is no longer needed\u201d or \u201cBLM is a hate group\u201d (which are 2 things I strongly believe), they are not being alt-right, they just don\u2019t agree with those two things. If anything, I\u2019d think that MOST conservatives would think those things. \n\n\nDespite the lack of alt-right sentiment in these views, many news outlets,(CNN, MSNBC, etc.), repeatedly use the far right as being the main group who hold these views. And this brings in a new problem; if leftist media dismisses such arguments as \u201calt-right\u201d, they are indirectly saying that these views are not worth discussing, effectively silencing the right. \n\n\nThis becomes clear when looking at their target audience; democrats or left-leaning people. Many of them trust these sources to deliver the truth, and will believe what they are told, as, well, it\u2019s the news; their job is to tell the truth, or at least it\u2019s supposed to be. So when these news outlets call these views \u201calt-right\u201d, views that a good amount of people on the LEFT hold as well, they are doing two things. \n\n1. If the viewer does not hold these views, they will likely take away that there is no point in debating these topics, as the only people that hold them are sexist, racist, homophobes. (Which is vastly untrue)\n\n2. If the viewer does in fact hold these views, they are being told that those views are only held by sexist, racist, homophobes, and that they should re-evaluate they\u2019re opinion or be considered a member of the alt-right, bullying them into giving up their beliefs. \n\nBoth of these outcomes are very dangerous, as it eliminates the chance of a discussion. Most people will not agree on everything, but the only way to stay civilized is to discuss, debate, and attempt to understand each other\u2019s views better. Without doing this, our country turns into a political war zone where everyone is calling everyone else racist, sexist, bigot, snowflake, and any other buzzword that can be thrown at the opposing side. This, unfortunately, is what has happened to our country today, and news outlets like CNN and MSNBC are part of the problem. \nThe right is not the Alt-Right, the Left is not the Far-Left, and the ability to sit down and agree to disagree is the only chance that we have to revise this hostile political climate that we are living in now.

My parents divorced when I was young, but I get to see both.  I have a step mother, and 2 step sisters, and 3 brothers(2 half brothers on mom's side and 1 full brother).  I had a step father and another step sister, but my mom divorced him.  I have a wonderful boyfriend(dom), who I've been with for almost a year and a half.  I also enjoy producing electronic music.\n\nNow I am not really a conservative.  My beliefs are akin to many conservative beliefs, as they are with other political groups, but I dont conform to any specific group.  I identified as being with the Liberal party, but I left after seeing overwhelming hypocrisy, hatred, racism, and oppression of anyone who didnt conform.  I am sorta in between, mostly Libertarian, but I think the Left is much more toxic than the Right.  I know Leftists who aren't complete nutjobs, and are really good people who I've had debates and discussions with(who've changed my mind on some topics, and I've changed their mind on others, as well as agreed to disagree), but their voices are silenced by the oppressors on the Left.  I know of Right-winged individuals who *are* complete nutjobs, but their voices are silenced by the sound minded.\n\nThe far Left is pushing many Liberals away from the Left.  Many YouTube voices are also deconstructing myths, like the wage gap and such.  Celebrities, like Ben Shapiro, and that one \"Change My Mind\" guy(I don't remember his name) are talking about these things.  I focus more on social politics, and see many things wrong with society that go ignored.\n\nMore and more people are becoming aware of both sides, and I feel like that is super important.  Minorities are oppressed by Leftist ideas, and are told they are victims, which I wouldn't wish upon anyone.  The victim mentality makes them vulnerable and defensive.\n\nSocialism, which is a Left supported situation, keeps the rich rich and the poverse poverse.  Even now, its really difficult for a young adult to buy a house and make a living, because of all the taxes put in place by socialist policies.  Look at Venezuela, its a really bad place to live, if you live in the city.  I had friends from Venezuela, and they lived in the country, where it was safer, but it still wasn't safe.\n\nThat's just my views on everything.  This is really just to spark discussion, and to share my viewpoint.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I felt like this was a good place to share my thoughts on the situation with the left."}

I don\u2019t live in the state, so this is just based on what I was hearing over the past few months, but it was being marketed as a two-man race with general election polling accounting for both him and Hawley (and Petersen performing better against McCaskill). Going into today I was expecting that to be the primary to watch, with it being decided by a couple % deep into the night. \n\nAnd yet, Petersen just finished 3rd, with about 8%, behind someone I\u2019ve never heard about, while Hawley had a commanding victory over the field. \n\nWas it bad campaigning\/poor groundgame? Policy (I know he\u2019s not great on borders, but that doesn\u2019t seem like it would be a bellwether issue in MO like it would be in TX, AZ, etc)? \n\nI don\u2019t particularly care so long as we flip McCaskill\u2019s seat, but did anyone here follow the race closely and know what the heck all the bluster was about if he didn\u2019t even break double digits?

I break down the logic for each of these predictions. Ask me anything about them, agree or disagree, I welcome debate.\n\nThis is the map I see for the Senate. Republicans on track to flip North Dakota, democrats on track to flip Nevada. However, there are eight realistic toss-ups here. I do go by some polling information, but take it with a grain of salt depending on the partisan tilts, accuracy, and track records of the polls. Also, if the poll is exclusive to the state. I go by historical trends, voting trends, state composition, county maps, and some combination of the last presidential election.\n\n* 14 Solid Democrat Seats (relative safety of Minnesota regular enforced by Special election)\n* 4 Solid Republican Seats (relative safety of Mississippi regular enforced by Special election)\n* 3 Seats \"Likely Dem.\" Barletta a disappointment in Pennsylvania, but not likely to elect another republican to US Senate. Not enough information to dictate where Michigan goes after John James' GOP Primary win; not enough information to predict the safety of New Jersey after slim poll numbers for Menendez. Neither seat is guaranteed.\n* 2 Seats \"Likely\" Rep. O'Rourke staging an underdog attempt, but the state still has a massive partisan tilt. Trump's low-margin victory here entails doubt, although Cruz won more votes for himself than the entire democratic turnout. Mississippi (S) is likely for the sole reason interim senators have horrible track records for reelection. Still, MS has a large partisan tilt.\n* 3 Seats \"Lean\" Dem. Wisconsin is \"easier\" to flip than Michigan or Pennsylvania, but not enough information as primary has not been held. Unlikely to elect another republican to US Senate. Minnesota (S): MN is a changing state, and Tina Smith is pretty vulnerable if republicans rear a good candidate. MN also has many competitive House races, and a term-limited governor, Mark Dayton (D). Voter turnout should be strengthened, as MN gets hit with everything this year. Ohio is too much of a swing state to elect another Republican, but there was a time when Ohio's two Senate seats were controlled by the same party. Unlikely to happen now, but if the economic boom continues there, the race *could* become more competitive.\n* Tennessee \"Leans\" republican simply because of the partisan tilt of the state. Blackburn received more votes for herself than the entire Dem turnout. Tennessee does not appear to be as competitive as most are making it out to be. Bredesen is the last democrat to date to be elected governor of Tennessee and also carry every county.\n* Nevada has a slight D \"tilt\", as a swing state that is slightly to the left of the national centre. A tight governor's race and a possibly competitive House race could add to turnout. Heller is highly vulnerable; only republican incumbent running for reelection in a state Clinton won in 2016.\n* West Virginia has a slight D \"tilt\" due to Manchin being a household name and a very moderate democrat.\n* Montana has a slight D \"tilt\" due to Tester's popularity, and the anomaly Montana is, as a result of years of split-ticket voting. The recent scrap between Tester and Trump, I believe, has affected this race.\n* Realistically, there are 8 toss-ups: Nevada, Arizona, Montana, North Dakota, West Virginia, Indiana, Missouri, Florida.\n* More information should follow after all primaries are held, more polls are conducted, and more rallies are held. And - of course - if any candidates really screw the pooch.\n\nAgree ? Disagree ? Have changes ? Hate me entirely ? Let me know down below. Realistically, Republicans have a chance at a net gain of about 4 seats, but we'll see how it goes.\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/nzhv3wzz8ze11.png","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Senate Prediction 2018 - Republicans Hold; Net Gain = 0"}

Instead we offer a third way.

The simplest and most direct way to restore order in our cities is to put more police on the streets. Democrats support more community policing, which uses foot patrols and storefront offices to make police officers visible fixtures in urban neighborhoods.\n \n&gt;We must further the new direction set in the Family Support Act of 1988, away from subsistence and dependence and toward work, family and personal initiative and responsibility.

{"author":"thatrightwinger","created_utc":1533914901,"num_comments":79,"score":123,"selftext":"Lefties here dribble in nonstop about how proof that Trump has colluded with the Russians is a fact and he is proven guilty. There are three problems with this.\n\nFirst, there is not evidence yet that Trump himself has colluded with Russia. Certainly Trump Jr. has, and there are certainly people within the Trump 2016 campaign who were dirty, but that\u2019s not enough to do anything to the president himselft. Saying Manafort has been indicted and is on trial is not evidence. Saying a bunch of Russian spies have been arrested is not evidence. Saying that Facebook interference is not evidence. In order to go as far to say that Trump \u201ccolluded,\u201d you have to show that he was involved personally.\n\nSecond, catching Donald Trump in a meeting with representatives of the Russian government by itself does not rise to the level of criminality. Collusion is not a defined crime under federal code, and therefore isn\u2019t enough by itself. In order to indict Trump, it\u2019ll have to be conspiracy. Conspiracy is a crime, but that requires actual or planned acts of criminal activity. Mueller would have to prove that Trump has actually acted in an illegal manner against the Hillary Clinton campaign, and there is absolutely no evidence of that whatsoever. Is there evidence that a foreign agent was paid to provide dirt against a candidate, and was information provided by the foreign agent. Yes, but it wasn\u2019t by the Trump campaign, but by the Hillary campaign, and it\u2019s not even in question. Hillary\u2019s campaign unquestionably paid former British spy Christopher Steele to dig up dirt on the Trump campaign and received information about the Trump campaign. This is indisputable and unquestioned. But no one on the left calls that \u201ccollusion.\u201d\n\nThird, the question must be asked: What has the Russian government gotten out of the Trump administration? The answer: nice words about Putin and a lot of headaches. For all of President Trump\u2019s bluster, the US has strengthened ties with NATO nations which border Russia (like the Baltic states and Poland) has sold arms to Ukraine, and has placed and recently strengthened tariffs against Russian goods. If Russia expected to have Trump look the other way while they did things which hurt the US, they would have lost out. Trump\u2019s words about Vladamir Putin and Russia have been sweet like honey, but his actions have been strongly against Russian interests. We know what Obama did: he was caught in a microphone saying to Dmitri Medvedev that he would give flexibility to Russia once he was re-elected. Hillary Clinton Russian reset netted millions of dollars for people like John Podesta and for the Clinton foundation. We have evidence that Hillary went soft on Russia, and we see the perks she and her lackey\u2019s got out of it.\n\nIs it possible that evidence turns up proving that Donald Trump participated in criminal activities against the Clinton campaign. Yes, until Robert Mueller actually releases his findings, the possibility will be out there, but that appears to be highly unlikely. The fragments that have thus turned up have been very poor, and Mueller would have to be holding evidence so tightly that no one would be leaking it, and that seems unlikely, especially since Russia would also have said evidence. If things continue this way, an unbiased person would have to conclude that no illegal activities have been committed by Donald Trump, and that all the screaming by the left has thus far come to naught.\n\n*When working as a mod here, I commonly see the same things over and over again.  It gets tiresome.  So in a special service to the subscribers of \/r\/conservative, and as a warning to the morons who think they know everything about the Mueller investigation because they've read The Young Turks, I am going to provide you with truth so that we can be clear about what's accurate and what's not.  If lefties come in here and try to state that Trump is proven guilty based on what they think are facts, but are mere speculation, they'll be banned.  We're not wasting our time on you.  This is my own work, though the other mods know what I have written*","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Hey Lefty Brigaders: There is No Evidence of Criminal Activity"}

My parents were textbook hippies in the 70s. I was raised in Canada after they divorced. I dealt with a lot of racism and abuse and made the decision to emigrate to the United States at 18, where I've been ever since. Even though my experience with racism as a Canadian soured me on the country, I was a committed socialist, like many Canadians. You're kind of raised with it. I also had a disdain for Americans - you're kind of raised with that too. But I came to the U.S. for a better life, despite my negative attitude toward Americans. Like most black people I was simply a default Democrat. I didn't know any Republicans or conservatives who looked like me...and why would I? They're all racists. I'd grown up hearing that Republicans wanted to bring back slavery and conservatives hated women, blacks and SEX! I believed the rich were fleecing the poor and I had a deep resentment towards my privileged white peers. I felt very strongly that most of America's problems were the result of racism and an unequal distribution of wealth. Despite my socialist beliefs, I actually worked hard to put myself through school and earn enough money to move around the country having different experiences. When I married my husband I moved into his home in Gary, IN. Before that time I'd lived in the \"ghetto\" but never was really a part of the culture. I could leave when I wanted, move on to other things when I wanted, etc. etc. I guess you could say I was \"privileged\". But in Gary, I suddenly became a PART of the neighborhood and I quickly set about putting down roots. My husband's father was a local and well-respected pastor. Together we opened an after-school program for inner city youth. Gary is about 87% black, so our hearts were directed to serve our population in the education arena. My FIL was the first black man I'd ever met who proudly called himself a \"conservative\" and a Republican. I was perplexed. We would often argue about things like socialism vs. capitalism, racism and inequality. He gently but intelligently challenged my notions of economics and prosperity. At the same time, here I was working every day with kids from an underprivileged, underserved population and watching how their struggles were so different day-to-day than kids in other areas. And I got to see how all the policies I supported my entire life actually worked and I realized...they didn't. I started to realize that maybe my thinking on what \"help\" really is might be more based in theory than real-world experience. One day I was having a conversation with a group of 5th graders about saving for their future and I realized - how can I sit here and out of one side of my mouth tell them the White American \"MAN\" will always keep them down and the odds are stacked against them and they'll alway be victims while out of the other side of my mouth trying to inspire them to reach for the stars and telling them they can be whatever they want and they don't have to feel trapped in their circumstances. That was the moment I decided to #WalkAway. I knew the rhetoric I'd been absorbing and regurgitating all these years wasn't just ill-informed, it was dangerous. It was keeping good people from recognizing that their less-than-ideal circumstances could actually be a springboard to hard work and success. That was a little over a decade ago. I don't like to call myself a Republican, but I'm conservative with libertarian leanings and I truly believe that America doesn't necessarily OWE us opportunity, America IS the opportunity. We don't all start off on equal footing, but just being here puts us 5 steps ahead of everyone else in the world. I feel strongly that is a message of empowerment for black Americans and I want to see my community thrive using the values and principles of free enterprise and God-given rights.","subreddit":"walkaway","title":"I'm a Black Woman Who Decided to #WalkAway From the Democrat Party After Running an After School Program in the Inner City...Ask Me Anything""num_comments":22,"score":331,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I'm a Black Woman Who Decided to #WalkAway From the Democrat Party After Running an After School Program in the Inner City...Ask Me Anything"}

In many ways I am still very liberal. When thinking about my fellow man I see a Mexican life being as valuable as a Muslim life, being as valuable as my own... Or as Bill Hicks put it:\n\n \"I hate patriotism... I can't stand it. It's a round world last time I checked.\"\n\nHOWEVER. I've started to notice just how cruel, biased, and rude the media and most liberals are in general when talking to or about anyone conservative... This didn't match up with my idea of a world without borders where veryone accepts everyone. As an anthropologists we were trained to look at every group of people subjectivly and to understand that they come from different cultures and while they may not hold the same values and may not be equal in many fields, they still hold value, legitimacy, and merit....\n\nMost anthropologists were liberal...But a big question arose in my head.... Why the fuck did we extend this subjective unconditional understanding to every single group of people except conservatives and majorities. It's one thing to understand the history of race, culture and sexism...It's another thing to demonize an entire race, sex, or culture(conservative culture) to extend an agenda.\n\nI had an epiphany, an ironic epiphany. The current state of anthropology, was fundamentally anti-anthropological...It was in denial of an unbiased perspective of conservative culture as well as white culture. Anthropology has been so steeped in white guilt that it's been unable to give itself the same benefit of the doubt it gives every other group of people.\n\nSo I started approaching those traditional values I grew up with in a different light, in the same light I approached my studies into Kalahari Bushmen...And while there was indeed a racist past...There was also a rich culture of values.\n\nI went to Wyoming for archaeological field school and fell in love with the land, I spent 30 days camping in different areas of wilderness. The life was different out there in the sagebrush. People aren't bothered by the shit I see very day in Seattle. There's no need for liberal politics because it's fundamentally a different way of life. \n\nI now consider myself a moderate. I refuse to believe that 50% of America is \"uneducated\" or \"bigoted\" or \"stupid\", that's the easy way out and I'm not falling for it. I believe a lot of liberals think they're fighting the good fight, but they have a loose grip on reality. i could say the same for a lot of conservatives, but I guess that's just how the water is right now.\n\nI will always listen to both sides reasoning....But fuck man, I know I'm at least a 3rd conservative cuz I get a massive hard on when I hear Ben Shapiro shut people down.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"I just want to say I've swayed more conservative in the last year than I ever have #walkaway"}

This is the current status of the field Connecticut voters are suffering ahead of the August 14th Primary. As good as it is to see this many options for a people who have suffered eight long years under Malloy and his cronies reign. However, with mere days until the primary this is not the position the CTGOP should be currently in.\n\nThe Democrats have their candidate in Ned Lamont, despite corruption Joe consistently being a proverbial thorn in the side of frontrunner. Let us discuss the field that we are left with, starting with Steve Obsitnik; a graduate of both the United States Naval Academy and Wharton like our current current president. From a practical point of view he would be a solid choice, however, he was unable to dethrone the Incumbent in District 4 Jim Himes who grows more polarizing with each passing moment. Tim Herbst, a relatively unknown name outside of Trumbull and neighboring towns. Throughout his candidacy he has come off as genuine and personable as his interview on Fox &amp; Friends showed viewers, however, his policies on policing and methods to how he would help curb the Opioid epidemic are outdated and stale. Now we move onto the Marco Rubio archetype in the gubernatorial race, David Stemerman, who's only tactic is to berate and denigrate the candidate nipping at the establishments choice heels. With no political prowess nor a marketable personality he has spent time siphoning off votes from the truly qualified candidate Stephanowski. \n\nThe establishment choice that came from the convention, Mayor Mark Boughton of Danbury. This candidate who has the appeal of putting on fresh socks and stepping in cold water. He could not defeat the two time loser Former Ambassador Foley in 2014 for the nomination. He is a candidate of a bygone era of the GOP that will not see a revival. The future is calling and it is not with the establishment frontrunner, there is only one clear choice and that is Robert Stephanowski. Bob has a clear plan for retaining talent and inspiring entrepreneurs to set up shop on Connecticut. With his goals to employ Zero-balanced budgeting as well as eliminating the personal income tax for Connecticut residents this will allow us to stay competitive with states like Texas, which have become a haven for business owners both small and large. The right thing for the republican voters of Connecticut is for Candidates to withdraw ahead of the primary and direct their constituency to vote for the only truly qualified candidate, Stephanowski.","subreddit":"Right_Wing_Politics","title":"URGENT: CTGOP Primary August 14th""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Please Read"}

They don't.\r\n\r\nConservatives do not hate government. Conservatives believe that government is an essential component of society that helps maintain order. stability and restrict emerging cultural threats. The law is a conservative idea. one that reflects the moral foundation of the society and its heritage.\r\n\r\nLibertarians rightly disagree with the left's ridiculous obsession with egalitarianism and their magical thinking about how productivity occurs. and take a more reasonable Social Darwinist approach to matters of economy. Healthy competition is the heart of our American business virtues. However. they make a mistake when they assume that all values of the society are subject to arbitrary youthful whims. They aren't.\r\n\r\nThe notion of \"conservatism\" originates with Edmund Burke. who wanted to ensure that society only changed slowly and with lengthy consideration so as to avoid catastrophe. He did not think the political class should be abolished. but that it should be virtuous and direct society for the betterment of all.\r\n\r\nIn order for the society to have a heritage. and therefore an identity. it must conserve to some extent the same values throughout the generations. Libertarians reject this crucial element of conservatism. instead desiring a society that changes radically with every left-originated social trend. until it no longer has its historical identity. and even demonizes its ancestry. To do this is not to be a conservative. but its very opposite. a Year Zero revolutionary who seeks to erase the past and start fresh.\r\n\r\nThis is a tragedy for our civilization. It is being undone by those who will decry healthy living according to eternal virtues. and hold up the banner of the \"alternative lifestyle\". Instead of being a proud and contributing member of a strong nation. we are \"unique individuals\" who feel alienated from everyone else. Instead of culture. we have conflicting subcultures. Our society dies as our new generations are indi into not having children. Guilt and hatred of the nation has become our commonality. and self-destruction is the natural consequence. Always \"progressing\". progressing towards a nihilist ideal. towards becoming Nietzsche's \"last men\". a death march towards collective suicide. It's a grim view of the future in which our civilization. the greatest civilization the world has ever seen. becomes overrun by competing civilizations who did a better job of conserving their fundamentals. Our values and culture become lost to time forever. We had achieved so much. only to throw it away.\r\n\r\nAs we get older and watch the world descend further into madness. and look back on our many foolish mistakes resulting from being suckered into popular liberal \"intellectual\" ideas. the picture becomes clearer. Those of us who change our ways and try to convince others can at least know we tried our best to atone. But you're going to have to fight those who want to destroy your culture. not tolerate them. Fool's errand or not. it's the least we can do. Don't seek to compromise between the left and right by calling yourself a libertarian and taking a simplistic worldview towards \"the real enemy\". government. While better than a leftist. you're missing the point.\r\n\r\n\n\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Libertarians are not conservative"}

While I like all of my coworkers and enjoy my work quite a bit, it seems like everyday at lunch or over a beer after work, everyone I work with always talks about politics under the assumption that everyone in the room shares one worldview. I usually stay silent not wanting to start a political debate where it is me versus my coworkers\/superiors. My fear is that this is only going to get worse as the election season ramps up, and then even more so once the general election campaign season starts and every lunch time conversation becomes \"orange man bad\" said in a variety of different ways, people will notice my silence on political issues and my views will come out at when political contention is at its highest, and they'll project anger onto me, or worse, it could hurt my chances at moving up in my career.\n\nSorry for a bit of a ramble, but it's to the point where probably over 95% of the people I have face to face interactions with on a regular basis are vocal liberals, so I just feel a little trapped right now that I either get called every *ist\/*phobic in the books or fascist by people who know I'm a conservative, or have to keep my worldview under tight wraps around those who don't.

They don't.\r\n\r\nConservatives do not hate government. Conservatives believe that government is an essential component of society that helps maintain order. stability and restrict emerging cultural threats. The law is a conservative idea. one that reflects the moral foundation of the society and its heritage.\r\n\r\nLibertarians rightly disagree with the left's ridiculous obsession with egalitarianism and their magical thinking about how productivity occurs. and take a more reasonable Social Darwinist approach to matters of economy. Healthy competition is the heart of our American business virtues. However. they make a mistake when they assume that all values of the society are subject to arbitrary youthful whims. They aren't.\r\n\r\nThe notion of \"conservatism\" originates with Edmund Burke. who wanted to ensure that society only changed slowly and with lengthy consideration so as to avoid catastrophe. He did not think the political class should be abolished. but that it should be virtuous and direct society for the betterment of all.\r\n\r\nIn order for the society to have a heritage. and therefore an identity. it must conserve to some extent the same values throughout the generations. Libertarians reject this crucial element of conservatism. instead desiring a society that changes radically with every left-originated social trend. until it no longer has its historical identity. and even demonizes its ancestry. To do this is not to be a conservative. but its very opposite. a Year Zero revolutionary who seeks to erase the past and start fresh.\r\n\r\nThis is a tragedy for our civilization. It is being undone by those who will decry healthy living according to eternal virtues. and hold up the banner of the \"alternative lifestyle\". Instead of being a proud and contributing member of a strong nation. we are \"unique individuals\" who feel alienated from everyone else. Instead of culture. we have conflicting subcultures. Our society dies as our new generations are indi into not having children. Guilt and hatred of the nation has become our commonality. and self-destruction is the natural consequence. Always \"progressing\". progressing towards a nihilist ideal. towards becoming Nietzsche's \"last men\". a death march towards collective suicide. It's a grim view of the future in which our civilization. the greatest civilization the world has ever seen. becomes overrun by competing civilizations who did a better job of conserving their fundamentals. Our values and culture become lost to time forever. We had achieved so much. only to throw it away.\r\n\r\nAs we get older and watch the world descend further into madness. and look back on our many foolish mistakes resulting from being suckered into popular liberal \"intellectual\" ideas. the picture becomes clearer. Those of us who change our ways and try to convince others can at least know we tried our best to atone. But you're going to have to fight those who want to destroy your culture. not tolerate them. Fool's errand or not. it's the least we can do. Don't seek to compromise between the left and right by calling yourself a libertarian and taking a simplistic worldview towards \"the real enemy\". government. While better than a leftist. you're missing the point.\r\n\r\n\n\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Libertarians are not conservative""num_comments":6,"score":0,"selftext":"[deleted]","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Gatekeeping: Libertarians are not conservative"}

With a big win for the DSA by [Alexandri Ocasio-Cortez](https:\/\/www.vox.com\/policy-and-politics\/2018\/6\/27\/17509604\/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-democratic-socialist-of-america) we see the rise of the left to take on Trump as well as the corporate democrats who have completely failed to address the needs of workers, immigrants, and others without power in this country. Some information on the [DSA ](https:\/\/www.dsausa.org\/)can be found below:\n\nThe Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) is the largest socialist organization in the United States. We believe that working people should run both the economy and society democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few. We are a political and activist organization, not a party; through campus and community-based chapters, DSA members use a variety of tactics, from legislative to direct action, to fight for reforms that empower working people.\n\nI am interested in forming a group of like minded individuals who seek to bring socialism locally to improve peoples lives. Knowledges of socialism or it's different types is not important to me but willingness to take action is. Reading books and posting on the internet brings no change but through local direct great changes can be made. \"The world is ran by those who show up.\"\n\nIs there anyone else interested in showing up? I don't know where our group will go next and I believe in Democracy at all levels including a possible group for the DSA. Come help shape our future.\n\nFeel free to message me or leave a post.\n\nEdit: \n\nHere is our facebook page!\n\n[https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Democratic-Socialists-of-America-Southern-Oregon-2227973134088631\/?modal=admin\\_todo\\_tour](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Democratic-Socialists-of-America-Southern-Oregon-2227973134088631\/?modal=admin_todo_tour)","subreddit":"oregon","title":"DSA in South Oregon""num_comments":0,"score":3,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Now they\u2019re not even trying to hide it anymore.

Liberal parents seem to go for this kind of \"free for all\" thing I never would even entertain the idea of. For example, letting kids dress how ever they want (especially girls. Sorry, but I'm a woman and I fully believe those of you who let your teenage daughters wear boots shorts and crop tops are doing them a disservice), giving teens the okay to watch porn, allowing them cell phones at age 10 or younger, encouraging them to \"date\" at 12 or younger...all themes I see repeatedly with liberal and \"neutral\" parents both on Reddit and in real life. \n\nLiberals are also overwhelmingly against spanking, with a weird ideology behind it. If that's not for you that's fine but the argument they repeatedly give is \"all hitting a kid does is teach them that's an okay way to react to something!\" No, because I don't teach my kids to do as I do. That would imply we're equals. They do as I say. Don't get me wrong, my children are treasured by both my husband and I. But we are the bosses. They have a ways to go before we're equals. Liberal kids are always the one who think they're adults when they're 12 years old. Their households are always the one where the kids are calling the shots.\n\nI'm just so tired of my parenting ideals being ridiculed when these folks endorse some of the most batshit, leftist methods I've ever seen. Who here thinks it's normal to be an adult and shower with a child? Who here thinks nudity in public, in any setting including the pool, is in anyway appropriate or notmal? This is the shit I get downvoted for in other subs. I will be the only person among 100 to disagree, and no, I don't think that means I'm wrong - I think it means a lot of people have been brainwashed.\n\n\n\n","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Conservative VS Liberal parenting"}

There is a link within that reddit post, but I purposely linked you to the comments on the r\/politics page to show you how malleable the left is.  As you can see, the vast majority of the comments are screaming 'Sieg Heil' while praising the DNC, while the comments that show skepticism and cynicality are downvoted with accusations of 'Russian bot' being thrown at the critics.  A story upvoted 50 thousand times, and a joyride of a comment section.  It is all there, saved in writing for you to read it.  It is the left's comments, not ours.\n\nWell you turn the clocks closer to midterms, and then this happens...  [Opps!](https:\/\/www.ecowatch.com\/dnc-fossil-fuel-donations-2595481111.html)\n\nNow before I get into Reddit's hypocrisy on the subject, I want to dive into the DNC's move here and breakdown their reasoning for this play.  This part is my opinion, obviously, but I believe it is a fairly obvious opinion and one even liberals may agree with.  I will try my best not to drive this point home with jeering against the left that I am known around here for.\n\nIt's pretty simple...  *The centrist vote is more important than the feelings of the far left.*\n\nThe DNC is very good at lip-service and pandering.  It is what they have used to win elections for decades now.  They know that getting votes from liberals is as easy as bait, hook, line, and sinker.  They know they do not have to follow through with any promises, and the left will turn out no matter what.  They could run Hillary again in 2020 while using the same blackout tactics that they used against Bernie toward whatever progressive candidate we see at the time.  In other words, they don't have to walk the walk for the progressive vote, just talk the talk.\n\nWhether you like it or not, oil and gas is the backbone of the American economy, and with almost 10 million jobs across the nation, o&amp;g make up almost 10% of the workforce in this country.  The DNC needs these people's money and the money of their employers.\n\nSo this tells us one of two things.\n\n- Despite what the media is telling us, the democrats are in a panic for November, and are now struggling to recapture the centrist vote\n\nOr\n\n- The DNC knew all along that they never intended to blacklist corporate o&amp;g money and were simply trying to entice progressives into getting out for special elections.\n\nThis isn't a conspiracy...  It is one of those two things.  The DNC really did claim it would refuse corporate o&amp;g money, and they really did welsh on this decision.  This isn't right wing fake news.  So which is it?  In my opinion, it is the former.  I think the DNC understands that no matter what they do, they will always have the liberal vote, always, and now they have to draw in the centrist vote in a booming economy.  If I am correct, you will see a strong shift towards the center in the campaign ads for democrats this coming election season.\n\nNow on to my favorite part of the story.  The stuff that left me giddy with excitement because I knew this was coming, and I think many of us did.

The Media Works for Us! Let's take back control with the MediaGate Movement!\n\nThe media has to be fixed. The levels of bias and media malpractice are off the charts in recent years, and it's doing huge damage to our country.\n\nConservatives, Libertarians and independents collectively own way more stock than Liberals:\n\n[http:\/\/webuser.bus.umich.edu\/gfdavis\/Papers\/Cotton\\_Davis\\_11\\_AEL.pdf](http:\/\/webuser.bus.umich.edu\/gfdavis\/Papers\/Cotton_Davis_11_AEL.pdf)\n\nWe literally own the media, yet they continue to relentlessly push a political ideology that the majority of Americans don't support instead of objectively presenting the events of the day. The media also advocates for socialist policies detrimental to the financial interests of their shareholders, and the fact that fewer and fewer Americans trust the news media and are tuning them out is simply bad for shareholder value.\n\nWe are calling for the creation of a shareholder activist group that will demand serious ethics reform at media companies:\n\n[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socially\\_responsible\\_investing#Shareholder\\_activism](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socially_responsible_investing#Shareholder_activism)\n\nWe can use the MediaGate banner to coordinate our efforts, and also to continue to highlight the most egregious examples of media bias. Please help spread the word about MediaGate whenever the topic of media bias comes up.\n\nOne idea for reform might be mandatory \"ethics boards\" at each media organization, rather than the toothless ombudsman role that never seems to actually improve things. These boards would be made up of individuals with a diverse set of political views representative of the population as a whole, and would police their organizations for instances of biased reporting and other ethics violations like conflicts of interest, with both the power to influence the hiring process and to fire repeat offenders. These panels could also push for \"ideological affirmative action\" in hiring, to get real diversity of political opinion instead of the current SJW hive-mind found at most media organizations.\n\nWe should also target the social media giants and entertainment media.\n\nSocial Media has become almost as influential as the mainstream news media. That's how we've been able to fight back against media bias over the last few years. However the gatekeepers at Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube) have proven to be just as bad as the news media and are now regularly banning, censoring and suppressing wrong-think. Because of Trumps' election and the coming midterms they are now doubling down against free speech.\n\nAs bad as the bias in news media is, it's unquestionably worse in entertainment media. There are now dozens of late night talk and sketch shows, and every single one of them leans left. Many are overt propaganda machines. Unfortunately these shows have a huge impact on shaping the public's understanding of the day's events, and yet somehow there are zero shows that reflect the politics of the majority of the country (if you add up Republicans, independents and Libertarians.) The major movie and TV studios are also becoming more and more blatant about injecting their political ideology into their work every chance they get.\n\nWe can use the same strategy outlined above to demand that social media companies protect free speech and treat all users equally whatever their political beliefs, and also demand that entertainment media companies break up their liberal viewpoint monopoly in order to better server viewers and shareholders.\n\nOur country is being torn apart right before our eyes. Please help spread the word about MediaGate  -this can work! It's time to stop complaining about the media and actually do something about it.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"MediaGate: How We Can Actually Fight Back Against the Media - Conservatives, Libertarians and independents own way more stock than Liberals...

Classical Liberalism, which is basically the GOP platform in many respects, is not Libertarianism. There is nothing that goes against principle to be for some interventions in certain cases, like Medicare, Medicaid, subsidies for farmers, tariffs to protect industries against unfair competition, and yes, even guidelines for companies which hold monopolies in the social media landscape.\n\nThe classical libertarian view in the US is the government provides defense of people's rights and the military and nothing else. This isn't the GOP platform and it never was the GOP platform. Right wing conservative parties have never expressed the view that the state should be limited this drastically. \n\nMedicaid is not going away, medicare is not going away. I don't understand why people are pretending that the world is ever going to get to a place where libertarianism is a mainstream, popular platform. If you don't get involved in the business of government and politics, you will lose to a progressive or socialist wave anyway and then none of your ideas are ever going to be implemented. \n\nThe idea of classical liberalism or American conservatism: limited involvement in the economy, respect for private property, respect for people's rights, and relatively low taxation coupled with some limited social programs.\n\nThere is not a SINGLE GOP senator who would vote to repeal medicare and medicaid. You wouldn't even get 20% of the party vote if you had a general referendum. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with being for some limited intervention to protect free speech when it is under assault by progressive billionaire oligarchs and tech companies.\n\nYes, facebook, google and youtube are private companies. But they're also massive monopolies. If you can't use them, you can't engage publicly. We should be searching for competitors, but as it stands, you can't be limited by principles which the vast majority of the Republican base or general worldwide conservative base don't even hold. If you don't fight, you will lose. \n\nI would rather intervene slightly to preserve the ability of right wingers on social media and youtube to speak than not intervene in the name of some lofty principle and completely lose my ability to speak at all.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Conservatism, Classical Liberalism are not Libertarianism or Anarchism."}

We have always been very upfront and honest about our purpose and direction.  We have never said that this subreddit is a platform for anybody - like Twitter or Facebook or Instagram or YouTube - of all political stripes to participate whenever they want.  That is why we have *moderators* who *moderate* discussion.\n\nWe have never - as far as I know - called for moderators of other subreddits to run their forums differently.  If r\/Liberal wants to only allow discussion by *Liberals* then that is their right.  Forums such as r\/Politics, r\/News, r\/Technology, r\/WorldNews are not - by their very definition - supposed to restrict submissions and discussions by ideology because they themselves are *general* forums.\n\nBut we all know they do censor.  Therefore they are *hypocrites* by going against their own mission statement.  And there is nothing hypocritical about us saying so.\n\nWhen someone is censored by platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc... for no other reason except ideology there is nothing hypocritical in us saying that is wrong because those platforms do not say that they will censor people according to their politics.  And they do not treat all \"politics\" the same.  The recent suspension of Candace Owens' Twitter account is yet another example of the double standard we see every day.  Or the censorship of Prager U by Facebook.\n\nWe're not telling other subreddits or companies to do anything but live up to their mission statements.  If that statement is to censor all Conservative speech then they are not being hypocriticial however *portraying* yourself as being content neutral but behaving in a contrary manner then there is nothing hypocritical about calling out that behavior.\n\nWe try, as best we can, to allow non-Conservatives to participate in discussions here *however* our first obligation is to fellow Conservatives and we will always defer to them.\n\nOur mission statement is if you are a Conservative, you're welcome.  If you're not a Conservative we will *moderate* your posts and comments *however we see fit* and there is *no* hypocrisy in that.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"Another post about our moderation policy..."}

I\u2019ve always paid attention to them as a way to justify my own ideas. I was working off confirmation bias. They always sounded racist and bigoted in the past, but things didn\u2019t add up once I started *trying* to understand.\n\nAn example of this is the deterioration of the black family. I always chalked it up to a history of oppression. Fair enough, but it doesn\u2019t explain why they progressed up to the 1940s and 50s, and then plummeted into crime and fatherless families.

{"author":"sweater_","created_utc":1534737036,"num_comments":38,"score":6,"selftext":"I don\u2019t really know why I\u2019ve decided to post this.\n\nI really hate Alex Jones. And I really really really hate what I envision to be the sum total of Alt-Right ideologies. And, on a related note, I think all of the subreddits that Reddit has ever banned are grotesque and despicable\u2014just the lowest form of humanity. And I think Jordan Peterson is a crackpot and Ben Shapiro is a little twerp.\n\nThat said, I think there is something deeply wrong with the fact that these behemoth corporations have the power to effectively silence dissenting opinions. More generally, there is something deeply wrong with my comrades on the left and their attitudes towards debate and free speech. I still think a lot of calls for \u201cmah free speech\u201d and \u201ccivility\u201d are an incomplete picture at best, but there is definitely validity to the fact that a *great deal* of people on the left, mostly moderate Democrats and the so called social justice warriors, are unwilling to honestly engage in a good faith way with ideas they disagree with. And furthermore, the \u201ccall-out\u201d culture and virtue signaling among white liberals is just insufferable. And silencing. Shame is not the correct way to promote democracy. \n\n***There are more important things. People who who have to choose between paying rent or paying electricity or paying medical bills. People who\u2019ve been out of work so long they\u2019re no longer on the unemployment tally.***\n\nI\u2019m not just talking about people on the internet, but people I know in my own life. Others, like the college kids who de-platform and those who are more left wing take an even more actively hostile approach. \n\nMyself, I\u2019ve realized I find it next to impossible to really debate someone in a good faith exchange of ideas, online or in person, rather than a battle of wills where the angriest or loudest person wins. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s me or that\u2019s just the nature of discourse in 2018. It\u2019s very troubling to me. It doesn\u2019t reflect my values as a socialist that believes that people are fundamentally good and that we can build a just and equitable society, where everyone, regardless of their race or religion or gender or income or nationality, is treated with dignity and respect. And honestly that includes white Christian Republicans just as much as it includes black trans women. Even if I think that one group has been historically privileged while the other has been historically marginalized. I think the left has made people feel *bad* to be who they are, people who have legit problems,  and I don\u2019t like it.\n\nFor Christ sakes, my mother in law is a republican and I can\u2019t even talk to her about immigration without it turning into a shouting match and she\u2019s a sweet-as-pie 72-year-old lady (I mean, she also has a glock, but that\u2019s charming as fuck, she keeps it in a cabinet with her good pearls and I don\u2019t want to live in an America where a goddamn grandma can\u2019t keep pearls next to her glock). Who\u2019s the asshole there? Me. Obviously. What is wrong with me?\n\nNeedless to say, I have recently broken out of a huge bubble of centrist liberal groupthink that I think I\u2019ve been floating around in since at least 2008. Before 2008, I was very *very* opposed to all sorts of things\u2014positions that I see reflected, in different ways, on the right. Certainly in the attitudes of many die-hard trump supporters. I was deeply critical of America as the world\u2019s policeman, trade agreements like NAFTA, globalization, the gross overreach of the US security state (or, haha, the Deep State, I suppose). On an Alex Jones related note, I also remember being pretty sure 9\/11 was an inside job for a couple of months in 2006...\n\nBut somehow, when my team won the election, I just started coasting. Maybe I\u2019d kind of look up when another drone strike killed a bunch of villagers, or I\u2019d make a passing remark about the amount of undocumented immigrants deported. But by and large I stopped caring about things that are actually really, *really* important.\n\nSo what is this? A plea for empathy, maybe? A request that we all look inward and examine what is it we really, truly value deep down? Maybe it\u2019s that. \n\nWhat are your dearest values? Don\u2019t let it be dictated by your party. Don\u2019t forget what they are. You\u2019ll end up pretty ashamed of yourself.\n\nI\u2019ll see how it goes over here and then x-post to some liberal spaces.\n\nPS: I can\u2019t believe I voted for Hillary Clinton. [She literally had slaves in the 80\u2019s](https:\/\/www.currentaffairs.org\/2017\/06\/the-clintons-had-slaves)\n\nETA: fixed link\n\nEdit 2: if anyone has some suggestions for news and\/or journalistic analysis with a consistent yet conservative analysis of the news, I would be very interested to check them out. On the left I would recommend [the Intercept](http:\/\/theintercept.com)\u2014very critical of the security state under all administrations, but distinctly left wing\u2014and [Current Affairs](http:\/\/www.currentaffairs.org)","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"A leftist defense of Alex Jones...kind of..."}

One of my favorite annual traditions is Deadspin's \"Why Your Team Sucks 20XX\". I've eagerly awaited them the past 3 years loving how he holds nothing back against every team including the Superbowl winners. \n\nAnd yet this year I can't. I read the first two articles this year and had to stop. Everything is about how racist the NFL is and how broken the country has become towards NFL players and black people since Nov 8 2016. I tried again today and I simply can't  get through the first paragraph. \n\nIt's not just football either; I can barely read any news regarding entertainment of any kind because it's so furiously slanted that my opinion of \"hiring the best director to do the job\" doesn't get with \"SuperGirl needs a woman director\" and \"First transgender superhero played by lesbian who isn't lesbian enough\". \n\nEven podcasts are not exempt. Apart from Ben Shapiro the agenda permeates everything fun. Sawbones, MBMBAM, and The Adventure Zone are fun to listen to but politics is shoehorned in ways that don't warrant them. Even Around the NFL has had moments of leftist political talking points. \n\nI suppose my question is why does the leftist political agenda HAVE to permeate everything entertaining to the point of turning people away and alienating a portion of their audience?

{"author":"SuperCharged2000","created_utc":1535086114,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":" \n\n&gt;Why  did  the face in the Oval Office change but the policies remain the  same?  Critics tend to focus on Obama himself, a leader who perhaps has  shifted with politics to take a harder line. But Tufts University  political scientist Michael J. Glennon has a more pessimistic answer: **Obama couldn\u2019t have changed policies much even if he tried.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \nThough  it\u2019s a bedrock American principle that citizens can steer their own  government by electing new officials, Glennon suggests that in practice,  much of our government no longer works that way. In a new book,   \u201cNational Security and Double Government,\u201d **he  catalogs the ways that the defense and national security apparatus is  effectively self-governing, with virtually no accountability,  transparency, or checks and balances  of any kind.** He uses the term **\u201cdouble government\u201d:** There\u2019s **the one we elect, and then there\u2019s the one behind it, steering huge swaths of policy almost unchecked.** Elected officials end up serving as mere cover for the real decisions made by the bureaucracy.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Glennon  cites the example of Obama and his team being shocked and angry to  discover upon taking office that the military gave them only two options  for the war in Afghanistan: The United States could add more troops, or   the United States could add a lot more troops. Hemmed in, Obama added  30,000 more troops.  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In fact, he is the  quintessential insider: He was legal counsel to the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee and a consultant to various congressional  committees, as well as to the State Department. \u201cNational Security and  Double Government\u201d comes favorably blurbed by former  members of the  Defense Department, State Department, White House, and even the CIA. And  he\u2019s not a conspiracy theorist: Rather, **he  sees the  problem as one of \u201csmart, hard-working, public-spirited  people acting in  good faith who are responding to systemic  incentives\u201d\u2014without any  meaningful oversight to rein them in.** [https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/ideas\/2014\/10\/18\/vote-all-you-want-the-secret-government-won-change\/jVSkXrENQlu8vNcBfMn9sL\/story.html](https:\/\/www.bostonglobe.com\/ideas\/2014\/10\/18\/vote-all-you-want-the-secret-government-won-change\/jVSkXrENQlu8vNcBfMn9sL\/story.html)\n\nIt's been called \"The Permanent State\" and \"The Double Government.\" Call it what you will, it definitely exists.\n\n[Former CIA agent whistle blower Kevin Shipp explains the Deep State and the Military Industrial Congressional Complex.](https:\/\/youtu.be\/XHbrOg092GA)","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"What is the Deep State?

However, despite Reddit being a perfect place for such a thing, the system of karma allows lazy and angry ideologues to simply silence those who disagree. It would be bad enough to be invisible in the discussion, but even more egregious is the restriction on posts, allowing many to gang up on you without giving you the ability to set the record straight. \n\nAnyone who looks at my comment history can see that I am not a provocateur, nor am I interested in saying hateful things to others, nor do I spam others or anything that would justify such arbitrary restrictions. I only say what I truly believe is right and I am punished for this for no good reason. The solution would be for me to betray my principles and speak with the goal of seeking upvotes just to remain relevant in a discussion. Obviously, I will never do this. \n\nI have no interest though in seeking out a community of like-minded Americans where we only self-validate but cannot expose others to our ideas or be exposed ourselves to theirs, but I am here only to seek a solution to my problem. I even went to 4chan in an attempt to find this, and while there is no karma system, those on that site are simply to far removed from reality to be of any value in pragmatic discussion.\n\nHas anyone discovered a way to deal with this?

I list these below simply to demonstrate to non-farmers what makes a farm functional and profitable. The first to go would be all the livestock followed by all the machinery including tractors, pumps, silos, centre pivots, electrical transformers, irrigation equipment, water troughs, implements and piping. I would strip the dairy and sell the bulk tanks, milking machines etc. I would take down all internal fencing on the farm and recoup what I could. All sheds would be disassembled and all houses and other buildings would be stripped of anything sellable, including their roofs.\n\n* I would disconnect\/cancel the 5 Eskom points on the farm and obtain refunds on the deposits I\u2019ve paid on them.\n\n* I would re-trench all my staff and pay them off in accordance with the Labour Act. I would then strip all the staff accommodation on the farm and sell what I could.\n\n* With the sale of all my livestock and cessation of the farming operation I would immediately default on the R5.5m I owe FNB but I wouldn\u2019t worry as the farm is the loan\u2019s security and I don\u2019t really own anything else.\n\n* When the day came to leave the farm I would hand the \u2018keys\u2019 over to the new \u2018owners\u2019 but I\u2019m not quite sure what they would do as there\u2019d be no roof on the farm house and there would be nothing to \u2018farm\u2019 on the farm. It would just be a piece of land, but that\u2019s ok because the ANC says owning land makes you wealthy.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you take the sequence of events described above and multiply it on a national scale you see another sequence of events unfolding.\n\n* The new \u2018farmers\u2019 arrive on the farm but there is no livestock, machinery or working capital to continue the operation.\n\n* They go to the banks to borrow money (A good farming habit) but the banks are sitting on a R160 Billion defaulted debt book from the \u2018old\u2019 farmers and won\u2019t lend a cent to agriculture. They\u2019re fighting for their own survival now.\n\n* The Govt doesn\u2019t have the money, which would be far more than the R160 Billion mentioned above, to re-capitalise and finance all the farms so most of the farms either fall derelict or are farmed at a subsistence level.\n\n* There is a massive but short-term surplus of Beef, Sheep and Poultry products due to the sell-off by the previous farmers. This brings prices down drastically in the short term but eventually the meat runs out and there is nothing to replace it. Meat prices skyrocket.\n\n* Dairy products cease almost immediately after the livestock cull\/sell-off and within weeks there is a critical shortage of all dairy products. Importing is impossible due to the Govt\u2019s actions which have decimated the value of the Rand.\n\n* Maize lasts quite a bit longer and with careful rationing will endure until the next season but there is no crop in the ground for next year due to the new \u2018farmers\u2019 lack of machinery, experience and access to credit.\n\n* All agricultural Co-Ops and suppliers very quickly cease operation and\/or go bankrupt and re-trench all their staff. They cannot survive by selling single bags of seed and fertilizer to subsistence farmers.\n\n* All processors of agricultural products such as meat, dairy and maize cease operation due to lack of product and re-trench all their staff.\n\n* Rural Municipalities start to feel the pinch as there are no longer any farmers paying rates and the agricultural businesses in the towns have also sold up and left.\n\n* Smaller rural towns that depended on agriculture eventually collapse and rural communities are forced to travel long distances to major centres to find ever dwindling supplies.\n\n* Ironically the EWC movement creates more Urbanisation as the rural folk flee the agricultural desert that has been created.\n\n* All food dependent enterprises such as fast food chains and restaurants either disappear or are greatly reduced\u2026along with all their staff.\n\n* With all the unemployed farmworkers, as well as those who have lost their jobs from other sectors, there is an unsustainable demand on the UIF system and it soon collapses.\n\n* The Social Grant system teeters as the ripple effect from the agricultural collapse enters all sectors and the tax-base is shredded.\n\n* Food riots become common and genuine hunger and poverty widespread.\n\n* Unlike Zimbabwe the South African population has nowhere to run.\n\n* With the White Farmer no longer an available target and the true \u2018value\u2019 of land revealed in all its fallacy the masses turn on the only target they have left. The ANC.\n\n\n\n\n\n-[Source](https:\/\/www.goldismoney2.com\/threads\/what-will-happen-when-the-anc-takes-my-farm.196818\/)\n\n---\n\n#Atlas Shrugged","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"What Will Happen When the ANC Takes My Farm - The Plans of a White South African Farmer"}

What The progressives really want is to regulate the stigma behind having an abortion.  Not abortions themselves, they\u2019ve already won that battle.\n\n\nYou hear these girls screaming about how they don\u2019t have access to abortions which is just a lie.  It\u2019s easier to have an abortion than it is to find a good mechanic.  What they are really doing is deflecting in a way.  Deflecting their own insecurities about it and such.  It\u2019s easier to say you didn\u2019t get an abortion because you didn\u2019t have access to it than it is to say you didn\u2019t have one because maybe it was too heavy a decision.\n\nIt\u2019s their own moral hesitation down deep which has them stomping their feet demanding something they already have.\n\nMe personally - I don\u2019t approach this from a religious or morale standpoint.  I\u2019m not a pro-lifer per se and I don\u2019t care if abortions are legal or not.

The levels of censorship, bias and media malpractice are off the charts in recent years, and it's doing huge damage to our country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u200bConservatives, Libertarians and independents collectively own way more stock than Liberals:\n\n\u200b [http:\/\/webuser.bus.umich.edu\/gfdavis\/Papers\/Cotton\\_Davis\\_11\\_AEL.pdf](http:\/\/webuser.bus.umich.edu\/gfdavis\/Papers\/Cotton_Davis_11_AEL.pdf)\n\nWe literally own the media, yet they continue to relentlessly push a political ideology that the majority of Americans don't support instead of objectively presenting the events of the day. The media also advocates for socialist policies detrimental to the financial interests of their shareholders, and the fact that fewer and fewer Americans trust the news media and are tuning them out is simply bad for shareholder value.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are calling for the creation of a shareholder activist group that will demand serious ethics reform at media companies:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u200b[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socially\\_responsible\\_investing#Shareholder\\_activism](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socially_responsible_investing#Shareholder_activism)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u200bWe can use the MediaGate banner to coordinate our efforts, and also to continue to highlight the most egregious examples of media bias. Please help spread the word about MediaGate and the MediaGateMovement sub whenever the topic of media bias comes up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne idea for reform might be mandatory \"ethics boards\" at each media organization, rather than the toothless ombudsman role that never seems to actually improve things. These boards would be made up of individuals with a diverse set of political views representative of the population as a whole, and would police their organizations for instances of biased reporting and other ethics violations like conflicts of interest, with both the power to influence the hiring process and to fire repeat offenders. These panels could also push for \"ideological affirmative action\" in hiring, to get real diversity of political opinion instead of the current SJW hive-mind found at most media organizations.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u200bWe should also target the social media giants and entertainment media.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\u200bSocial Media has become almost as influential as the mainstream news media. That's how we've been able to fight back against media bias over the last few years. However the gatekeepers at Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube) have proven to be just as bad as the news media and are now regularly banning, censoring and suppressing wrong-think. Because of Trumps' election and the coming midterms they are now doubling down against free speech.\n\n\n\u200bAs bad as the bias in news media is, it's unquestionably worse in entertainment media. There are now dozens of late night talk and sketch shows, and every single one of them leans left. Many are overt propaganda machines. Unfortunately these shows have a huge impact on shaping the public's understanding of the day's events, and yet somehow there are zero shows that reflect the politics of the majority of the country (if you add up Republicans, independents and Libertarians.) The major movie and TV studios are also becoming more and more blatant about injecting their political ideology into their work every chance they get.\n\n\u200b\n\nWe can use the same strategy outlined above to demand that social media companies protect free speech and treat all users equally whatever their political beliefs, and also demand that entertainment media companies break up their liberal viewpoint monopoly in order to better server viewers and shareholders.\n\n\u200b\n\nOur country is being torn apart right before our eyes. Please help spread the word about MediaGate -this can work! It's time to stop complaining about the media and actually do something about it.","subreddit":"Conservative","title":"r\/MediaGateMovement: How We Can Actually Fight Back Against Big Tech &amp; the Media - Conservatives, Libertarians and independents own way more stock than Liberals...
