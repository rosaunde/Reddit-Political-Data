{"author":"Meadow_Foxx64","body":"Well, contemporary contributors to the discussion over Marx's value theory seem perfectly acquainted with the historical objections and address them in detail (e.g Andrew Kliman in *Reclaiming Marx's \"Capital\"*).  The charge that contemporary Marxists are just ignorant of economic history, and hence, can be dismissed just fails to engage with the contemporary literature which is an engagement with these sorts of issues, as well as a suggestions for a program for further inquiry.  \n\nIn comparing it to flat earth theory, you are just presuming that Marx's value theory has been discredited, much like the theory that the Earth is flat, which is exactly what is being discussed, and hence, cannot be presumed.  As for Marxists allegedly abandoning Marx's law of value, this may be the case in some instances (e.g Cohen and Roemer's case), however, it isn't the case with most of the living, influential Marxist theorists \u2014 i.e Kliman, Freeman, Foley, Harvey, and so on.  Again, you don't have to address Marx's value theory if you're not interested.

I maintain my claim that the first page of results from Google query you cited is wanting.  The results, at least the results that show for me, are all rooted in a very, very poor understanding of Marx's theory of value.  The best resource is the Wikipedia article, which does give some examples of historically informed criticisms, all of which I think have been plausibly addressed by the likes of Kliman and such.  The Anarchist FAQ was an example of the Marxian value theory and its influence on contemporary anarchist thought, so I'm not sure what your point there was.  Finally, the fact that I could barely find someone who understood Marx's value theory, let alone critique it without making terribly bad mistakes, seems to indicate there is a bit of difference between the Earth and value in the context of political economy.  I remember in my economic textbook from years ago, the labor theory of value was covered and completely misunderstood with the supposed refutations being a meteorite that flew to Earth with gold whose value was not produced by labor, which was somehow supposed to be a refutation of Marx.","created_utc":1525156268,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Ironically, Brave New World didn't actually discredit the tools by its portrayal of a dystopia, but the effect of a hierarchical society with such tools at their disposal. To really understand this, one probably needs to read both books. Men Like Gods by itself is just fancy socialist scifi. The necessity for such a lateral structuring of society only really becomes visible when one adds Huxley to the mix.\n\nIt's not entirely correct to call Huxley right-wing btw.

If you do not buy this claim, let's examine the critiques that you are present\n\nThe Wikipedia article consistently conflates between price and value, so that the fact that certain commodities are really, really wanted by people who will pay a handsome price somehow contradicts Marx.  The issue is that Marx never equates price and value and acknowledges that commodities will, in the real world, deviate from their value.  This is actually what is done in the critique from microeconomics, the critique from Menger, and the critique from Marshall that are listed.  Directly under the Wikipedia article is an article from the Mises Institute which is equally terrible.  The argument, an argument Marx himself addressed, is that, if Marx was right, a slow-worker would produce more value than a fast worker, which is counterintuitive.  As Marx himself explained, skilled labor can be analyzed in terms of unskilled labor, hence, the fact that value is the labor time socially necessary required to produce an article under the normal conditions of production, and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time, is not an argument against Marx.  The next link is a link to Tyler Cowen's blog, where he seems to think the labor theory is a theory of market prices, hence, the fact that supply-and-demand fluctuates makes Marx's labor theory unuseful.  The issue is that Marx's theory was explicitly not a theory of market prices and, under general market conditions, Marx made it quite clear that the price of a commodity would deviate from its value.  The same was true under monopoly conditions, which Tyler might also have in mind.  In short, the labor theory of value simply isn't a theory to explain market prices, so the fact that it cannot is inconsequential.  He also makes mention of the transformation problem, which I already alluded to where it has been given plausible solutions (i.e in Kliman's book).  Paul Cockshott, on his YouTube channel, discusses the problem and where it goes wrong.  The next links are links to Quora where the theory of value, once again, is misunderstood.  The alleged counter-example is that a miner finding a diamond without exerting any labor, which is just a variant on the meteorite example I recall from my economics textbook.  Marx's theory, however, states that the value of a commodity is equal to the labor time socially necessary to reproduce a commodity under the normal conditions of production.  If the conditions just described were the normal conditions of production, then Marx's claim would be that such an object would have a low value (not necessarily a low price, however).  Those, of course, aren't the normal conditions of production, and so, it is not a counter-example to Marx's theory, which is not a theory of the value of accidental discoveries of rarities, but rather, of commodities under the normal conditions of capitalism.   The next article is written by a xenophobic racist who I do not think is even worth addressing, but I'll simply note they also make the conflation between value and price, as Tyler and Wikipedia did, which was never done by Marx, who made it clear that he didn't think the two would coincide under the conditions of capitalism.  The Investopedia article, which is the last article on the first page of results from your query, does not actually give any objections to Marx's theory, but rather, situates it in economic history.  This, I think, has been done much better in *Marx, Marginalism and Modern Sociology*, however, I do not have any specific complaints against the article, as it seems to be an okay (not great, however) summary of Marx.  \n\n\n\nI'm not \"ducking-and-dodging.\"  Again, my claim is that the resources you linked are not in the least bit helpful.  The fact that some economists misread Marx is of no surprise to me.  Economists such as Piketty admit that they have never read Marx and economists, such as Brad DeLong, who claim to have read and appreciate Marx (though he was wrong), also have no idea what they're talking about.  In his article on Marx's theory of value, for instance, DeLong doesn't even present Marx's theory of value, but rather, his theory of exploitation.  Marx's theory is a theory of commodity production under capitalism, so I'm not sure what your last remark is meant to concern.  Public policy wouldn't change in light of Marx's theory.

{"author":"nultrasol","body":"From Stirner to Kropotkin, as with most white theorists, were incredibly racist and problematic. I don\u2019t fuck with \u201cproducts of their time arguments\u201d, but to add a layer of \u201cuhh\u201d I don\u2019t think Kropotkin actually wrote that rather may have used an equally bad slur in Russian that was translated as such.\n\nI think it\u2019s a testament to a shit ton of things. We need to know how to be critical of folks whose works we may have influence us and be aware of how that can condition us if we are uncritical. Any kind of purity notions or thinking stuff is unproblematic like... it\u2019s an issue.\n\nLemme elaborate further. There\u2019s a lot of white anarchists who don\u2019t seem to understand or have nuance of race. This shines through, but there\u2019s some examples of this.\n\nLouise Michel, first holder of the black flag, was deported to New Caledonia. When the native Kanaks rose up in revolt, radical leftists sided with their oppressive colonial government against the indigenous people rightfully rising up. Michel, being consistent with her anarchism, joined the indigenous rebellion. Yet many white leftists were quick to side with the same oppressive regime when indigenous folk rose up.\n\nAlbert Camus is another in a bad sense. Although a radical leftist, Camus sided WITH the French government against the Algerian uprising. It\u2019s because he was a white dude born in Algeria and felt entitled as he heavily related to being a \u201cPieds-Noirs\u201d. He said it was apart of Arab imperialism and anti-western. It\u2019s a pretty shit analysis and honestly, I think he just was emotionally attached to what he viewed as his home, even if it was only his home as a result imperialism. He never favored Algerian independence even if he thought coexistence was possible. Roughly, he sounds like a one state solution type person who\u2019d end up picking Israel to put this in a more current context. \n\nIf we chose to absorb any degree of thought, we must be critical of every aspect, and every source. One of my closest comrades say they refuse to read academics or upper class writers of anarchism, which would largely exclude many and especially early theorists of anarchism. \n\nI think we should aim to be as critical of those whom contributed to the movement, less we end up like the statists with their cults of personality.

Rothbard maintains that anarcho-capitalism is the only true form of anarchism\u2014the only form of anarchism that could possibly exist in reality as he argues that any other form presupposes an authoritarian enforcement of political ideology, such as redistribution of private property.\n\n... \n\n&gt; However, Rothbard also wrote a piece, published posthumously, entitled \"Are Libertarians 'Anarchists'?\" in which he traced the etymological roots of Anarchist philosophy, ultimately coming to the conclusion that \"we find that all of the current anarchists are irrational collectivists, and therefore at opposite poles from our position. That none of the proclaimed anarchist groups correspond to the libertarian position, that even the best of them have unrealistic and socialistic elements in their doctrines\". Furthermore, he said: \"We must therefore conclude that we are not anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical. On the other hand, it is clear that we are not archists either: we do not believe in establishing a tyrannical central authority that will coerce the noninvasive as well as the invasive. Perhaps, then, we could call ourselves by a new name: nonarchist\".\n\nRothbard seems confused by the nature of libertarian socialism in general - since it does not necessitate the centralization and re-distribution of resources. Rather it is the voluntary sharing and collective organization of voluntary actions which completely betray centralization and forced re-distribution. Only under *authoritarian* socialism \/ communism does the centralization and re-distribution he talks about occur, and it is easy to see he simply does not understand anarchism.\n\nEither way, anarchists are anti-capitalist and see capitalism as a coercive and necessarily hierarchical system. \"Anarcho\"-capitalists are essentially market fundamentalists, or laissez-faire liberals. The term libertarian, much like anarchist, was co-opted from the left-wing anarchists by the right-wing propertarians.  ","created_utc":1525211321,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"JumpJax","body":"&gt; I mean you must have the rungs of society basically stacked with barely a hair between them until you get to the richest of the rich positioned at the highest levels of power.\n\nPersonally, this analogy didn't make any sense to me, so my following statement may not be an accurate response to your own statement.\n\nHierarchy is basically a pyramid, with fewer people at top with more power. Cops are basically one level above non-police proletarians, but that still gives them a wide base to control. It may seem like they have quite a bit of power, but that is only because they have a lot of people to manage. They, however, have no power in and of themselves.\n\n&gt; Whats the point in this kind of exercise in 'not everywhere at all times'?\n\nTo find the essential sources of hierarchy and dismantle it. Since the police force is only an organ of oppression, fighting the organ is not the same as fighting the hierarchy that created it.\n\n&gt; You're effectively trying to displace any thought as to the responsibility and privilege and power of cops.\n\nI'm trying to find the source of the oppression. You have the idea that the oppression comes *from* the police, but I am saying that the police are only an organ of the oppression, which itself is controlled by a system of oppression. The manichean idea that an oppressor can not also be oppressed hurts the analysis necessary to dismantle societal power structures.\n\n&gt; And your analysis is basically \"if you're not Ceasar you're not really responsible for anything\".\n\nIf you want to be more blatant about not taking me seriously, you should just call me a \"petty bourgeois propagandist.\"\n\nI'm talking about how systems of oppression are not housed in a single organ of the state. I'm talking about how a person can be oppressed and oppressor. I'm talking about how fighting people that have no function but to have us fight them and to have them fight us is counterproductive.\n\nI'm talking about how changing systems changes how people interact with each other. In an anarchist society, there wouldn't be police, so these actions must have developed due to capitalistic statism.","created_utc":1525246519,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"va_str","body":"The definition of communism we use is \"a classless mode of society\". This necessarily excludes states or authoritarian hierarchies in general. Your confusion comes from a combination of factors which result in a severe misconception of terminology, in some cases to the extent that certain words are now used in direct contradiction to their original meaning. One such word is \"libertarian\", another is the \"anarcho\" in ancap. You're a capitalist, not a socialist. Anarchism is not compatible with coercive economic hierarchies.\n\nIt's pretty difficult to explain ancom to someone like you, since there is a lot of unrolling that needs to happen first. It doesn't help at all that the words we use mean something else to you. You can thank the extensive western propaganda machine for that. If you really want to learn more about it, you may have to do some reading. Coming from the capitalist side of things, a good entry point is probably the mutualist approach to property. I don't agree much with it, but to you a lot of things will at least sound familiar. Communist economics are thoroughly different, so I can't recommend you jump straight into that. You can probably visit that when you've got a better understanding of property and its socioeconomic implications. \n\nThe tried and true suggestion of \"googling bookchin\" probably makes sense here. If you're not averse to reading some sloghtly racist and sexist analysis of property by a long dead guy, \"What is property\" by Proudhon is a very good entry into unravelling the brain on capitalism. Despite being classist in some ways, Proudhon is spot-on in the economic direction. ","created_utc":1525249971,"score":5,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"waaaghboss82","body":"&gt;Isn't communism extremely, and I mean extremely, authoritarian? As I see it, you couldn't establish an Ancom territory without the usage of violence, as communism isn't the 'natural order of things'.\n\nWell no, not necessarily. All communism means is \u201ca classless, stateless society where the means of production are collectively owned and operated.\u201d The authoritarian associations with it come from marxist states in the 20th century which attempted to create communism by using the state to get rid if capitalism, and then later getting to the \u2018stateless\u2019 part. But this is hardly the only way.\n\nWith regards to the \u2018state of nature\u2019, i would contest that as well. Most archaeologists by now agree that, within social groups, resources were freely shared based on bonds of mutual trust, and barter was only used between unfamiliar groups without much contact. Meanwhile capitalism has only existed for a couple hundred years, emerging after the receding of feudalism. To me, my current existence of needing to wake up, drive 45 minutes away from the rest if my life, and work most of the day, for someone else i dont actually know, so i can go get food, lodging, water, all locked away behind a paywall, is much less \u2018natural\u2019 than what anarchist communism entails.\n\nOf course any anarchism requires the overthrow of the current social order, which will mean violence. But once established theres no real need for violence except in the case of normal self defense.\n\n&gt;You either need to fully convince people of the benefits of communism (of which, I must say, you're not doing a great job of as of yet), or use violence to keep them from starting up companies.\n\nI mean if we\u2019re assuming there was an ancom revolution i think s lot of people are already convinced of it. But regardless once means of production are held in common violence isn\u2019t required to stop capitalism from \u201cspringing back up\u201d. \n\nIf you\u2019re going to start a company and hire people to work for you, you will generally only do so if you are going to make more profit. Just how businesses operate. What this means is that they create more value for you than they cost you, with their pay included in that cost. So why would anyone choose to eork for a capitalist, and receive wages, which are *necessarily* worth less than the labor that worker put in, when instead they could work for an anarchist co-op, where they can receive the full value of their labor?\n\nViolence is not required to suppress capitalism, because in the society we aim to create, capitalism is obsolete. Someone trying to start a company in \u2018ancompton\u2019 would be like someone today declaring their neighborhood a feudal fief, and telling their neighbors that they are now serfs who should start building his castle. It just wouldn\u2019t make any sense for people to go back to the old social order.","created_utc":1525273061,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Since taxation occurs on an individual basis, countries with a smaller number of wealthy people are excluded from the benefits of UBI\/NIT because of the smaller pool of people to pull from, regardless of their total level of wealth\/income\n\n2) the impact on immigrant rhetoric would be disastrous. if you think people complain about 'immigrant freeloaders' now, just wait until they get actually free money and take their \"toll\" on an already top heavy program. The alternative is that immigrants are excluded from UBI\/NIT which furthers the class disparity between legal\/illegal. The resultant pressure on housing markets from the newfound security of the lower class and inability of the bottom rung to adapt would lead to a homeless problem among immigration, wouldn't be surprised if we saw the development of new shanty towns in America\n\n3) the first problem could be somewhat ameliorated by a progressive negative income tax as opposed to UBI (*not* the libertarian flat income tax), but, the only realistic way this would pass in somewhere like America is as a flat income tax, and you bet your skeezer that the American capital machine will do whatever it can to prevent a highly progressive negative income tax from forming.\n\nSynthesis of 2 and 3)... if the American capital machine opposes something, they let no sense of humanity stand in their way. They would actively scapegoat the needy and the immigrants but with more force than ever, and the selfish average American will fall head over heels for the racist freeloader rhetoric.\n\n4) focusing on American implementation, in the current political climate there is 0 chance that UBI\/NIT would pass without a focus on cutting extant welfare programs\n\nThere are many more reasons for which I disagree with UBI, but I just think it's a bad idea in principle","created_utc":1525300805,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

They look for apparent quick fixes on a global scale and rarely consider the possibility of unintended consequences from such hamfisted solutionism.

Liberals sell activists out \u2014 they appropriate and subsume active struggles into codified \u201ccompromises\u201d with terrible terms that become deadweight burdened on future generations. Their hearts are sometimes arguably in the right place, but only in a cavalier and dismissive way that does immense damage.\n\n&gt; Anarchists, in contrast, are far more pessimistic but also far more audacious. We know there aren\u2019t easy simple solutions. We know that building a better world, a profoundly different world not overwhelmingly characterized by relations of domination and rulership but liberation and solidarity, will take time and continual effort on countless fronts. That our progress towards liberation will never be measured in terms of a simple variable like how many seats in a legislature our team has, but rather in billions of variables, billions of considerations. Culture, narratives, technology, infrastructure, habits, all the way down to our interpersonal relations, our everyday lives. Anarchists embrace grappling with such complexities. We resist writing anything off, accept no limited horizon to our considerations or our desires.\n\n&gt; Thus to anarchists \u201cliberals\u201d are the opposite of radicals because they don\u2019t strike at the roots of power itself.

The pipeline was projected to run from the Bakken oil fields in western North Dakota to southern Illinois, crossing beneath the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, as well as under part of Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. Many in the Standing Rock tribe considered the pipeline and its intended crossing of the Missouri River to constitute a threat to the region's clean water and to ancient burial grounds. In April 2016, Standing Rock Sioux elder LaDonna Brave Bull Allard established a camp as a center for cultural preservation and spiritual resistance to the pipeline; over the summer the camp grew to thousands of people.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1525312737,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"syndic_shevek","body":"David Graeber's \"Debt: the First 5000 Years\" addresses this topic in a very satisfying way.  It's available for free in [e\\-book formats](https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/Debt-The_First_5000_Years) and as an [audiobook](http:\/\/www.unwelcomeguests.net\/Debt,_The_First_5000_Years).\n\n&gt;\"By turning human sociality itself into debts,  they transform the very foundations of our being \u2014 since what else are  we, ultimately, except the sum of the relations we have with others \u2014  into matters of fault, sin, and crime, and making the world into a place  of iniquity that can only be overcome by completing some great cosmic  transaction that will annihilate everything.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"Trying to flip things around by asking, \"What do we owe society?\" or even trying to talk about our \"debt to nature\" or some other  manifestation of the cosmos is a false solution \u2014 really just a desperate  scramble to salvage something from the very moral logic that has severed us from the cosmos to begin with. In fact, it's if anything the culmination of the process,  since it's premised on the assumption that we're so absolutely,  thoroughly disentangled from the world that we can just toss all other  human beings \u2014 or all other living creatures, even, or the cosmos \u2014 in  a sack, and then start negotiating with them. It's hardly surprising  that the end result, historically, is to see our life itself as something  we hold on false premises, a loan long since overdue, and therefore,  to see existence itself as criminal. Insofar as there's a real crime here,  though, it's fraud. The very premise is fraudulent. What could possibly  be more presumptuous, or more ridiculous, than to think it would be  possible to negotiate with the grounds of one's existence? Of course it  isn't. Insofar as it is indeed possible to come into any sort of relation  with the Absolute, we are confronting a principle that exists outside of  time, or human\\-scale time, entirely; therefore, as Medieval theologians  correctly recognized, when dealing with the Absolute, there can be no  such thing as debt.\"\n\nAlso pertinent is this classic quote from Ursula K. Le Guin's \"The Dispossessed\":\n\n&gt;\u201cFor we each of us deserve everything, every  luxury that was ever piled in the tombs of the dead kings, and we each  of us deserve nothing, not a mouthful of bread in hunger. Have we not  eaten while another starved? Will you punish us for that? Will you  reward us for the virtue of starving while others ate? No man earns  punishment, no man earns reward.

That power can (and has) been taken away for what has been seen as abuses by the power structure. That power is granted to the police force in trust, but it is not *their* power.\n\n&gt; I never said that.\n\nYou just said that police are near the top of the pyramid. Maybe you mean that even though they are near the top, they are not where the oppression comes from, but I feel like that would help my argument.\n\n&gt; And you're basically being hyper reductionist here by suggesting that any interest in this element of the system is irrelevant or misplaced and missing the bigger picture.\n\nIt's hardly reductionist to argue that we should look at more than one subsystem. What I want to do is look at the series of subsystems as a whole to discover where the supersystem becomes oppressive. Since the police don't exist in a vacuum, we shouldn't treat them like their oppression is devoid of context. The subsystem may exists and can be described, but if we don't look at how the supersystem interacts with the subsystem, then we are not getting an accurate picture.\n\nFor example, the state may be an oppressive institution, but if I ignored how capitalism plays a role in the supersystem to oppress people, then I would have a right-libertarian interpretation of the facts that can't accurately diagnose the oppression of the subsystems, let alone the supersystem.\n\nSo while it may be frustrating to you that I conceptualize the police as a piece of the oppressive institution and not as a solitary institute, I think that it is necessary to understand both the police force and the supersystem that is the state and capitalism.","created_utc":1525322795,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I grew up being told: \"this is your job, do it, don't make a big deal out of it\". Westerners aren't like that though. So when I came to the left after 18 years of living in a conservative Muslim household I was told (implicitly) by comrades: \"*if you really want to fight colonial capitalist hegemony* you will put the hijab back on\" (the implication being, I'm in the wrong for taking it off and giving my former religion the finger).

To understand it, you should first look at the history of Kurdish separatism, which has been going on since the 80s. PKK has been made a scapegoat for the troubles of the Kurdish region and the country itself, by the state. For thirty years, the Turkish people have been reared to hate PKK by this constant state propaganda. So, the overwhelming majority of the Turkish people sees PKK as the devil itself, basically. But this hatred does not carry over to a hatred of Kurds for the most part. Though there are way too many nationalists who have questionable attitudes towards Kurds, most people see PKK and the Kurdish people as different entities for the most part. They believe as if PKK somehow \"tricks\" the Kurdish people to pursue their \"evil agenda\", or prey on the Kurdish people, preventing their economic growth and so on. Pure propaganda.\n\nSo, this attitude carries over to Rojava, as well. This stems from how Rojava is presented in Turkey. Most people think that Rojava is troubled by an extension of PKK partly because officials goad them into thinking that. (No one even bothers to use the terms YPG, PYD or SDF, they just call it PKK to cause maximum effect). So they don't know, or want to know, what's going on in Rojava at all. They don't care that PYD is a legitimate democratic organisation that has the support of the local people. They don't know that these people are effectively governing the region. All they see is a reflection of their already distorted image of PKK: Terrorists who are trying to carve out a state while being completely isolated from the regular citizens. \n\nMy point is, while you may see this as a simple propaganda piece, it is much deeper than that. That soldier himself and the rest of the Turkish people might be thinking that they are fighting for that child's good.\n\nI should emphasize something though. There are a lot of people who are genuine imperialists\/nationalists that know what's going on and still support it.

But if said in the context of white men having more managerial positions than any other identity group, it makes it sound as if these people are better suited to the top position because of nature. Obviously this is not the case. There are a large number of complex sociological reasons why white men occupy more managerial positions. Try discussing privilege with JP though, and he'll go off the rails and call you a postmodern neo-marxist. \n\nOn a side note, your example of the Spanish Civil War is a bit unfortunate, since the military leaders of the anarchists in the war were typically political leaders as well, and they didn't have a central chain of command at all.

{"author":"kropotesta","body":"&gt;But I do have to question the logic of trying to organize a mass revolutionary movement in near total obscurity.\n\nBut isn't this precisely the point? The idea that a small group of radicals can somehow propagandize the working class to revolt has no basis in reality. As anarchists we recognize that a revolutionary movement rests on the self-activity of the proletariat. We've seen this repeatedly in the past, during crisis situations (Russia 1917, Italy 1920, Spain 1936, Hungary 1956) - when conditions become unbearable and people have no choice but to rise up. Workers councils and militias formed spontaneously to overthrow the state and the capitalist class without any instructions from an external source, anarchist or otherwise. \n\nThis isn't to say that anarchists - or radicals more broadly - have *no* role to play during a crisis period, but we can't simply will a revolutionary movement into existence, and so whether or not we have a \"visible presence agitating for these principles\" right now is irrelevant. Besides, even if I were to grant you that such a presence is necessary, having such a presence in the offices of the state will achieve nothing, and if anything will turn out to be counter-productive. Every single time a leftist politician has been elected into office under the promise of defending these principles, the principles have been diluted into nothingness, and the same politicians have turned into active enemies of the proletariat. Just look at what's been happening in places like Greece and Nicaragua. ","created_utc":1525372507,"score":18,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I think it's pretty undeniable.\n\nI mean I probably should be saying power structure rather than hierarchy. There might be justified hierarchical power structures, and there are justified competence hierarchies in which those held to be competent have no actual power over the others beyond their opinion or expertise being valued more. That's more like a bottom up hierarchy, where those who respect the competent person elevate them above other people while maintaining the ability to revoke that elevation at any point. Where I'd violently disagree with Peterson would be the enforcement of hierarchy using a power structure, since competency is self\\-evident and doesn't need a formal power structure with which to present\/defend itself.\n\n\\&gt; what does that exactly mean? Did you have a child to lord over? What does hierarchy mean to you in this case?\n\nI mean the competence hierarchy as described above, which is self evident and does not need formal power.

{"author":"CosmicRaccoonCometh","body":"I disagree to some extent. Radicals certainly can't bootstrap a population into being revolutionary, but history shows that different populations react to similar conditions in different manners -- and one of the reasons for this difference in reaction is to what degree the population in question is organized (not necessarily in the sense of unions, but just having some sort of communities of resistance) and\/or thinking of things in radical terms. \n\nA population with some experience in autonomy is going to be more comfortable with revolting against the status quo. A population with either dual power or counter institutions is going to have the tools of revolt more readily at hand and thus more willing to respond to crisis with something other than desperate reformism. There is a reason why one population in crisis responds with revolt, while another is assuaged with liberal reforms, while another accepts the increased levels of desperation as the new normal, and yet another is caught up in reactionary and\/or authoritarian movements.\n\nAnd, of course, all populations in crisis tend to have a mix of all these in response -- but the ratio of the mix and what response becomes predominant is what varies. And one of the things that contributes to that variation is the activities of radicals among the population prior to the time of crisis: the building of counter institutions, the creation of communities of resistance, the shifting of perceptions and constructs. \n\nAs much as I love the  Monsieur DuPont writings which agree with what you are saying here, I think it is important to remember that the population is not a static thing. It is a variable and an unknown that can be influenced. And the ways in which it is influenced will have an effect on the level of crisis at which it will have a significant response, as well as what the nature of that response might be. \n\n\n","created_utc":1525380232,"score":7,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"bigclams","body":"Copied and pasted from an FB post of someone that was there: \n\nI don't typically like to post about actions after I attend them, but this one is important to me. It's important because my comrades are getting harassed for sticking to their principles and I have something to say that supports them. This is my first hand account of January 20th, 2018 outside of FREQNYC nightclub from approximately 7pm-10pm where #ChelseaManning was just a few feet away from me for a couple of hours.\n\nFrom my observation and participation, I cannot confirm that Chelsea fed us any useful tactical information about what was going on inside FREQ. I cannot confirm that Chelsea entered the Cernovich event with any of our leftist people. I watched her exit and she was by herself. She was very noticeable because she left the venue and came directly to our side.\n\nChelsea came to the back of our crowd and said she was just inside and, \"that was so weird.\" She just kept saying it was so weird. I personally thought it was just someone who looked like Manning at that point. I reacted to her account of it being \"so weird\" negatively because to me that is not a strong enough reaction. I would expect guilt, trauma, anger, disgust, but not that. It really reminded me of why I stopped telling white people my stories of racial trauma in the first place. Their answer was always, \"wow that's so weird.\" If that's all you have to say about racism I don't want to be vulnerable around you.\n\nI heard her saying she told the party attendees \"I just came to observe,\" and I also rolled my eyes a bit because it obviously wasn't that hard for someone with Aryan features (and fame) to talk their way into such a party. I would hardly call that crashing. She's too famous to be a real infiltrator. She did tell us that our presence was messing with the attendees and they seemed tense\/were drinking a lot. I did not hear any other significant news that came from Manning and any other strategy developed was from comrades who had been outside. My observation was that Manning quietly stood in the back of our crowd outside FREQ and chatted with people who came up to her.\n\nI am not impressed with my (majority white) comrades who told me I should talk to Manning, or that she is \"really cool.\" I am vexed that (fucking white) people are going to such lengths to defend her as she is running for Senate (something that has a historical precedent of not working), has been to team-building activities with alt-righters (Escape the Room DC), and is close to Cassandra Fairbanks (source: the Observer). If you are not listening to your nonwhite comrades on this issue, you are fucking up as a comrade. You're messing up your relationship with nonwhite people on the left. Your relationship with your marginalized comrades needs to be more important to you than a would-be Senator.\n\nWhite comrades who are defending Manning: learn about implicit bias and accept that because Chelsea is a white lady, you really want to embrace the oppressed parts of her identity and give her the benefit of the doubt that you wouldn't give me or any other nonwhite comrade. Y'all aren't even giving us the benefit of the doubt that we know our history and that we know running for Senate doesn't do shit for the left. You insult our intelligence with every argument you make, you invalidate our experiences with white leftists, and you alienate us every single time you stand up for Chelsea Manning. You might not be saying, \"I don't believe or care about your experiences,\" but when you say \"she's different and worth our energy,\" that is what we hear. We hear you discounting decades and generations of lived experiences that tell us we should be at the very least cautious of Manning. Think about that.\n\nSome of you say she's done enough as a whistleblower, as an out-of-the-closet transwoman, and an ex-con. You're forgetting that many of our nonwhite comrades have blown the whistle on their own abuse and systemic violence and suffered severe social consequences. We speak out all the time at the risk of state violence also. Many of us are out-and-proud trans people. Many of us are ex cons and\/or veterans!\n\nMy #NYC comrades, at the very least don't tell her your name, details about your organization, or information about your other comrades. At least do that if you're not going to stop jumping to her defense. Lastly, support your local #J20 defendants!\n\n**********\nEdit: There has been an allegation claiming that Jared Kushner owns The Observer. This is not true.

Castro was 100% an opportunist and I'd love to know how aware of that Guevara actually was. \n\nAnd yeah he was terrible on issues of LGBTQ people but then again unless you *were* LGBTQ at that point in time pretty much everyone even on the radical left was. There wasn't a good, wide-spread analysis of liberation as it pertained to anyone who wasn't cis\/het. Eldridge Cleaver was a contemporary and wrote \"Soul On Ice.\" It was hailed as one of the great works on black liberation despite being *wildly* misogynistic and Cleaver going so far as to call him raping white women a \"revolutionary act.\"\n\nGiven all that, it's not shocking that people had a pretty poor understanding of why things like LGBTQ liberation would be important. It's also important to keep in mind that Communism, especially the dogmatic variety that Guevara followed, hyper-fixates on issues of class and as such tends to not see or flat ignore other issues.\n\nGuevara absolutely shouldn't be hailed as a hero but it's important to contextualize him with his time and recognize that, while sincere, his analysis of the situation was deeply flawed and while he might be a valuable case study for several key concepts (mainly strategy as it relates to armed resistance) he is ideologically toxic.","created_utc":1525408689,"score":6,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

The mobs were smashing windows, slashing tires, dragging parked cars into intersections, even throwing bedsprings off overpasses into the traffic down below. This was the quote, student protest. That's not student protest, that's civil war.\"\n\n\nOn May 14, two students were killed and 12 wounded, by police at Jackson State University in a similair scenario. Unfortunately, the Jackson State killings did not get the same nationwide attention as the Kent State shootings.\n\nA Gallup Poll was taken immediately after the shootings. The results showed that 58% blamed the students, 11% blamed the National Guard and 31% had no opinion.\n\nThere was a wide discussion as to whether it was a legally justified shootings of American citizens, and whether the protests or the decisions to ban them were constitutional. \n\n\n\n\nVictims of the Kent State Shootings:\n\n\n\nKilled:\n\n\n\nJeffrey Glenn Miller: age 20 shot through the mouth, killed instantly.\n\n\n\nAllison B.

{"author":"yanofero","body":"I totally agree with you! There's a ton of connection between free\/libre open-source software and anarchism\/communism. Creating software available to everyone to use, modify, learn from, distribute, etc. is in pursuit of the common good-- and a lot of this FOSS (Free Open-Source Software) is definitely better for users. For example, how can you tell your software isn't spying on you or working against you if you don't even know what it does? (Open source code is key to this).\n\nI think you also make a good point about imagining media that's free. Communism could allow artists and creators to pursue their passions freely as long as their needs are provided for-- and not having to depend on income to survive could make this free for all.\n\nThe other major distinction between digital goods and physical goods is that digital stuff can be replicated for a near negligible cost. We can't take a loaf of bread and duplicate it into another identical loaf without material resources, but once some software's been written there's no reason we can't copy it for anyone who wants it. Intellectual property is weird in that sense-- it's an attempt at privatizing and selling something that costs almost nothing to recreate (once the initial copy exists).\n\nYou mentioned how so many open-source developers work for free, as volunteers. Capitalists try to tell us that if we don't pay people (and put them in shitty circumstances that require them to work to survive), they would be lazy and bum around... Yet the tech workforce is full of people working jobs they loathe while simultaneously  working on projects important to them, for free, in their spare time. Open source development is a great example of the way people will volunteer their time to solve problems-- simply because they need solving.","created_utc":1525478579,"score":8,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

In an ideal socialist society, wherein workers cooperatively own the means and everyone's basic needs are met, there's no real reason to *want* power over others. There's no money to accumulate and resources aren't scarce. You do what work you can and you get what resources you need. ","created_utc":1525485282,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

They can garnish wages (most states have limits so they can't take 100%), seize personal property (typically one vehicle and your home are exempt, except if you're defaulting on a mortgage) and seize cash from bank accounts.\n\nRealistically, your amount is pretty small by their standards, and the legal fees may outweigh what they can collect.  Your level of income and any property you own is another factor.  They may consider you to be \"judgement proof\" if there isn't much to take.\n\nHere are some tricks to keep in mind.  If you choose to pay off the card and are having trouble, contact the card carrier and ask for a better payment plan.  You might get a lowered rate or more time to pay.  If they take you to court, (they have to win a judgement in court before they can collect) make sure to actually show up for any court proceedings.  Most don't bother to show, and some companies don't even bother preparing a case.  There's a chance that if you show the whole debt can get thrown out because they don't have a case.\n\nIf you default on the debt, immediately contact the company and tell them not to contact you to collect the debt.  Debt collectors do have to follow certain laws like the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  They cannot pretend to be government agents, lie about their intentions, threaten or verbally abuse you, and most importantly they can't continue to contact you if you tell them not to.  DOCUMENT EVERYTHING.  There are damages for these violations that an attorney can recover for you.\n\nYour sister is right that opening credit card accounts can help your credit, but the amount of debt you have on them has to be low, ideally only about 1% of your total limit a month.  If you pay off the card, keep it around and only use it every once and a while, while paying it off fully each month.

{"author":"FuckingTree","body":"This seemed really rambling and at times ignorant. \n\nThe problem with finding a spot for software on the spectrum of capitalist to communist is that most goods in a classic communist economy are produced by demand and distributed at a like-for-like level. Milk for wheat, wheat for bread. When you produce, it\u2019s not to create capital, but to distribute a service that can be shared. This isn\u2019t necessarily the case for most software. It\u2019s created to fill a specific need, or created from whim, and there\u2019s no solid expectation that people could want it. The supply is nearly perpetual, limited by external constraints like hardware or dependencies on other software. That said, if your main productive value as a worker is to create software, you labor on something that has low general value and high specific value. How do you equalize and decentralize distribution to a developer that needs it but can\u2019t provide value to billions of people? \n\nMost non-corporate developers charge for software because it\u2019s the only way to put specific value on a generally worthless product to support themselves. Not every project can be open source because if you\u2019re taking the time to write software, you\u2019re not spending your time in the community. A lot of people count on software, but not a lot of people are willing to trade other commodities if they don\u2019t have to deal with it personally. \n\nThis was a problem with art in communist countries in the past - art has no tangible value to society, so it was often considered a degenerate pursuit. Art propels culture but rarely is economy grown by paintings. I feel the case is similar with computer science. Computers have no value until you do something with it. How can we demand people volunteer their labor to produce software if we can\u2019t agree it\u2019s worth something in exchange?

{"author":"va_str","body":"Depends on how you look at it. Capitalism in a certain pre-industrial environment has been a massive driver for increased productive output. In Marxist terms, it is considered an environment for a step of the emancipation of workers. As slaves turned to servs under feudalism, servs turned to wage slaves under capitalism. Each step improved the conditions. Capitalism therefore is a step towards the complete emancipation of the working class under socialism. Engels called this the evolution of capitalism. The issue we have with it is that, though better than what was before in some ways, it isn't yet good.\n\nA huge issue is that we have reached a point where it actively prevents innovation in favour of profits. Particularly large scale automation which should favour everyone and a push towards post-scarcity are lethal to the system itself. Our tools and methods on the other hand allow excessive exploitation of existing resources and consequent destruction of the environment. It is time to move on, and moving on is in everyone's favour except for those who do not already do their share of the work while benefiting from our work total done disproportionately. When our production output constantly increases (and substantially so), yet wage averages stagnate and working hours stay the same, it becomes obvious that we have outlived the mode of economy and someone is stalling to get fat off of it.","created_utc":1525559918,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

But to a few of your points.\n\nNo, the 'natural heirarchies' lobsterboi talks about are not useful for anarchists, as they're an entirely different thing than you're talking about. He uses the idea of animal action to justify *the standing order*. We fundamentally can't reappropriate his ideas because he's justifying hierarchy, full-stop. The whole idea you're talking about doesn't need to come from Captain Misgender because it's a basic fucking concept.\n\nAnd while we're on the topic... the doctor not telling the farmer what not to do should not be understood as hierarchy. Yes, we reaffirm the idea that people work within roles for which they are trained. But does not and should not be understood as hierarchy. It does not have to imply authority over others. Even organizers and strategizers should not be understood as in a position over others, simply people within a team together. Understanding it as a hierarchy immediately carries with it conceptions of meritocracy which is fucking bullshit. People being good in their fields does not constitute a hierarchy.\n\nRegrading his maps of meaning... what exactly about that work is so valuable, and especially that hasn't been done better by others? Like he's not doing anything original. I'm genuinely curious about this and if you ignore everything else, please answer this for me.  \n\nAnd really, he's the door to a religious synthesis with anarchism, not liberation theology? Like sire, liberation theology has its gaps and shouldn't be our singular key (nothing should be). But you're really dismissing a theology that has its foundations in solidarity with the oppressed (both conceptually and in practice), a theology that has expanded to multiple marginalized groups, and instead putting forward a man whose claim to fame is misgendering non-cis people and whose audience is straight white dudes? Like really, that's our gateway to anarchist religious conceptions?

Nor would a turn to universal single payer eliminate the private insurance option, which still exists in countries like Canada.\n\nIf there were some other preferable alternative, like widespread worker unions providing broad health care services to the general population, then it would be worthwhile to be concerned about increasing reliance on governmental services to the detriment of these non-authoritarian alternatives. But when the choice is between healthcare driven by private business organizations enforcing distribution or public governmental organizations enforcing distribution, I don't see the point. As many others have pointed out, at least the governmental organizations are ostensibly open to broad public influence, rather than placing the subset of the population that can afford their services into the passive role of a consumer. \n\nThe end result of single payer in this context would be an increase in access to health care for those who are currently cut out by market prices.

Can you name me a single viable example of a society which has existed without a government?\n\n&gt;Anarchist: Sure. There have been thousands. I could name a dozen just off the top of my head: the Bororo, the Baining, the Onondaga, the Wintu, the Ema, the Tallensi, the Vezo\u2026 All without violence or hierarchy.\n\n&gt;Skeptic: But those are all a bunch of primitives! I\u2019m talking about anarchism in a modern, technological society.\n\n&gt;Anarchist: Okay, then. There have been all sorts of successful experiments: experiments with worker\u2019s self-management, like Mondragon; economic projects based on the idea of the gift economy, like Linux; all sorts of political organizations based on consensus and direct democracy\u2026\n\n&gt;Skeptic: Sure, sure, but these are small, isolated examples. I\u2019m talking about whole societies.\n\n&gt;Anarchist: Well, it\u2019s not like people haven\u2019t tried. Look at the Paris Commune, the free states in Ukraine and Manchuria, the 1936 revolution in Spain\u2026\n\n&gt;Skeptic: Yeah, and look what happened to those guys! They all got killed!\n\n&gt;The dice are loaded. You can\u2019t win. Because when the skeptic says \u201csociety,\u201d what he really means is \u201cstate,\u201d even \u201cnation-state.\u201d Since no one is going to produce an example of an anarchist state\u2014that would be a contradiction in terms\u2014what we\u201fre really being asked for is an example of a modern nation-state with the government somehow plucked away: a situation in which the government of Canada, to take a random example, has been overthrown, or for some reason abolished itself, and no new one has taken its place but instead all former Canadian citizens begin to organize themselves into libertarian collectives. Obviously this would never be allowed to happen. In the past, whenever it even looked like it might\u2014here, the Paris commune and Spanish civil war are excellent examples\u2014the politicians running pretty much every state in the vicinity have been willing to put their differences on hold until those trying to bring such a situation about had been rounded up and shot.\n\n&gt;There is a way out, which is to accept that anarchist forms of organization would not look anything like a state. That they would involve an endless variety of communities, associations, networks, projects, on every conceivable scale, overlapping and intersecting in any way we could imagine, and possibly many that we can\u2019t. Some would be quite local, others global. Perhaps all they would have in common is that none would involve anyone showing up with weapons and telling everyone else to shut up and do what they were told. And that, since anarchists are not actually trying to seize power within any national territory, the process of one system replacing the other will not take the form of some sudden revolutionary cataclysm\u2014the storming of a Bastille, the seizing of a Winter Palace\u2014but will necessarily be gradual, the creation of alternative forms of organization on a world scale, new forms of communication, new, less alienated ways of organizing life, which will, eventually, make currently existing forms of power seem stupid and beside the point. That in turn would mean that there are endless examples of viable anarchism: pretty much any form of organization would count as one, so long as it was not imposed by some higher authority, from a klezmer band to the international postal service.\n\n-- David Graeber  ","created_utc":1525571846,"score":62,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Its not really a discreet thing and is basically a smarter sounding way of comparing something to sprawling colonizing powers before the 20th century. It's not like there is a canonized 'Imperialist Manifesto' that would apply to the current world. Describing a state as imperialist is usually not falsifiable the way describing a state as Republican is.\n\nExpansionism is a quality of imperialism but it's not cut and dry rather or not it is a sufficient or even a necessary condition for a society to be Imperialist. Labeling a Communist crusade as Imperialist is going to depend on what you mean\/understand Imperialism to be. It's also pretty deep down the future fantasy theory hole.\n\nI personally think the ethics of liberation wars depends upon the severity of barriers to revolution.

By \"an un-examined definition of aggression\", I mean that it's impossible to define who is aggression upon who without a universally agreed upon set of property norms. By way of example, we'll use a three hypothetical neighbors, an an-com, a mutualist and an an-cap\n\n+ the an-com assumes that all land belongs to everyone \n\n+ the mutualist assumes that a parcel of land belongs to whoever uses it regularly\n\n+ the an-cap assumes that land belongs to whoever is the first to claim it, or who buys\/inherits it from the previous owner\n\none day, the an-cap builds a fence around their farm, and posts a sign saying that they will shoot anyone who climbs over the fence. The an-com is infuriated: what right does he have to construct barriers on public land and use threats of violence to hold his property hostage? However, the mutualist shrugs, and points out that the an-cap lives and works there, working the land every day - so, of *course* he can put up a fence. The mutualist thinks that that just makes sense. The an-com goes back to the house they've built, fuming - he knows he can't win a 2 to 1 fight if it comes to it. \n\nThe next day, the an-cap goes out to a nearby grove that he likes to use as a hunting stand very occasionally, and nails up signs on all the trees saying that it belongs to him and if anyone else wants to use it for anything, they'll have to pay him first. The mutualist discovers the signs when he decides to go out hunting a week later, is rather annoyed at the an-caps bizarre and presumptuous behavior, and gets into his usual tree to watch for deer. The an-com happens to come along, remarks on the signs to the mutualist, and joins him. They agree that it's very strange behavior on the an-caps part, and that they'll go to his house the next day. \n\nThey are somewhat afraid that the an-cap will shoot them if they try to cross the fence to get to his door, so they get his attention by yelling real loud. The an-cap comes out, and waves at them. They ask him why he put up those signs at the forest, and say that that's everyone's hunting spot, and he really has no right to claim it. He goes real quiet and then pulls out his gun, pointed at the an-com. As the an-cap is yelling \"death to all loot-\" the mutualist shoots him dead. \n\nNow: the core question - who, if anyone, was being aggressive in this situation?

{"author":"Bent-Bristle","body":"The society is set up in such a fashion that the factors which predict the formation of friendships (propinquity, proper settings, repeated interactions) are very rarely present.  There is very little sense of community in many parts of the country.  Cities are designed for cars, making it unfeasible and very unpleasant to try to get around without one.  The architecture is by design oppressive (brutalism in the cities, strip malls in the suburbs) and discourages people from congregating for the purpose of socializing.  Neighbors don\u2019t speak to one another.  \n\nEven the one place where people are meant to forge lifelong friendships (universities) are less than ideal in this regard.  I went to multiple universities during my studies, and what I found were large classrooms (200+ students) where everyone was mostly anonymous, cliquish people who weren\u2019t really open to interacting with anyone who didn\u2019t look or think like them, so thoroughly conditioned by the culture that by the time they got there, they didn\u2019t really know how to be good friends anyway.  Very few discussions about feelings, non-commercial aspirations, big ideas. No touching or holding hands like you see between friends in other countries. It was like most of them had no personalities to reveal, and if you can\u2019t reveal yourself, what connection with another can there be really? \n\nI used to ride one of the school shuttles and saw the same people every day for years. The ride was always so quiet that you could hear a pin drop.  These weren\u2019t strangers, but students who would be forced into contact every day, and yet they all seem terrified of each other, as though it were just a public bus where everyone should keep to themselves.  Here even the propinquity effect failed.  The ones who do manage to forge real, strong, lifelong friends (and I think they are in the minority) really don\u2019t bother with anyone else after they leave.\n\nI mean, when you think about it, it\u2019s rather absurd that there should only be one potential window for making friends, and then that\u2019s it.  But when you look at the way the society is set up, all too often that does turn out to be the case for a frighteningly large number of people.\n\nI think it\u2019s a combination of the capitalist conditioning (seeing others as commodities foremost) and the fact that many Americans are very judgmental and not very well socialized compared to other cultures.  Many still have that \u2018frontier\u2019 mentality, where apparently everyone is a potential enemy.  So many end up rejected that they come to lose the desire to be social altogether and preemptively judge and reject others as a kind of twisted defense mechanism.  This in turn creates a lot of mental problems that you don\u2019t find in societies that don\u2019t have the sophisticated forms of social engineering that have been employed here.  This is to say nothing of the destructive technologies that keep people hidden away from each other on screens.","created_utc":1525681218,"score":6,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

The media over-represents it because it freaks people out, and freaked out people pay more attention to the media. In a country of 340 million people, with enough guns for every single one of them, some very small amount of those people will take some small amount of those guns and shoot up public places. This is, I want to emphasize, not a significant factor in anything - it is very rare. Additionally, while - strictly speaking - public shootings would go down if the state took everyone's guns away, certain sorts of states would just shoot more people to make up for it, and -even if they didn't- abdicating that much power has much worse long-term consequences than an astronomically small chance of death. \n\nI am told that Chomsky's *Manufacturing Consent* is a decent primer on the media aspect of things, but have not read it myself.

In fact, the ISPs during the early internet wanted monopolies where they can charge the hell out of you (AOL), but these were eventually overthrown by the more open protocols. For a better telling of this story:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.case-podcast.org\/17-blockchain-technology-with-andreas-m-antonopoulos-part-2\n\n&gt; A. Antonopoulos: I think we heard this argument a lot more in 2014. It's beginning to wane a bit, because more and more people are beginning to understand better what this technology is. It's very similar to saying, like in the early '90s, \"Yeah, I like this idea of TCP\/IP or an inter-network, but I can do a better job with a different protocol, and if we don't do it on the public internet, which is full of weird people who can connect without us knowing who they are, but instead we do it on a closed network...\" - that's what birthed CompuServe and AOL and other gardens, and it also birthed a series of corporate internets.\n&gt; \n&gt; A. Antonopoulos: In the end, the internet proved that the most interesting innovation was happening on the open public internet, and the value of a simple protocol layer that had innovation at the edge and was decentralized and neutral to traffic, was far more effective than other protocols. There was a lot of competition in the early days between ATM, the OSI stack and TCP\/IP. And people said \"Well, TCP\/IP will never succeed, it's too simple. It doesn't have enough quality of service guarantees, it doesn't do prioritization, it doesn't do filtering, it doesn't do all of these other things.\" It turns out those things were what was keeping TCP\/IP open and allowing people to innovate to the edge.\n\nMaybe it's even *everything else* other than capitalism.\n\n&gt; Capitalism isn't the best system, but it is implemented better than any practices of communism in history. \n\nThis is bold claim and a big subject.

Thus capital creates the bourgeois society, and the universal appropriation of nature as well as of the social bond itself by the members of society. Hence the great civilizing influence of capital; its production of a stage of society in comparison to which all earlier ones appear as mere local developments of humanity and as nature-idolatry.  For the first time, nature becomes purely an object for humankind, purely a matter of utility; ceases to be recognized as a power for itself; and the theoretical discovery of its autonomous laws appears merely as a ruse so as to subjugate it under human needs, whether as an object of consumption or as a means of production. In accord with this tendency, capital drives beyond national barriers and prejudices as much as beyond nature worship, as well as all traditional, confined, complacent, encrusted satisfactions of present needs, and reproductions of old ways of life. It is destructive towards all of this, and constantly revolutionizes it, tearing down all the barriers which hem in the development of the forces of production, the expansion of needs, the all-sided development of production, and the exploitation and exchange of natural and mental forces.\n\n&amp;mdash; Grundrisse\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYep.

So long as millions of human beings in every country had to sell their labour-power to a small minority of owners, and to sink into the most wretched misery if they could find no buyers, the so-called \u201cequality before the law\u201d remains merely a pious fraud, since the laws are made by those who find themselves in possession of the social wealth. But in the same way there can also be no talk of a \u201cright over one\u2019s own person,\u201d for that right ends when one is compelled to submit to the economic dictation of another if he does not want to starve.\n\n&gt; Anarchism has in common with Liberalism the idea that the happiness and prosperity of the individual must be the standard in all social matters. And, in common with the great representatives of Liberal thought, it has also the idea of limiting the functions of government to a minimum. Its supporters have followed this thought to its ultimate logical consequences, and wish to eliminate every institution of political power from the life of society.

You treat those customers poorly or deliver a poor product, or just generally do something they don't like, you have no customers and therefore you have no business.  Same thing with workers.  If you need workers, you have to treat them well and reward them according to the value they provide.  If you do not do that, they go somewhere else, to a business that will treat them properly.  If you are a worker, and you want to make more money, well then you position yourself to grow and improve.  This system works, as long as government keeps their sticky fingers out of it.  I'm not saying this is the best possible system, I'm just saying it's the best one that we have come up with yet.  There are none better out there, and that's even with a country like ours where government is overly involved in the market!\n\n(It's worth noting that if workers put up with being treated poorly or working in \"poor conditions\" and do nothing, then IMO that is an issue with that person in one way or another.  Staying in an abusive relationship isn't entirely on the guilty party.  You always have options.  Although, that may be a topic which folks have differing opinions on.)\n\nLastly, where government has a place, is in being there to help settle grievances.  Obviously there are times where people will get screwed over.  We do need an effective way to seek retribution for wrongdoing and to help make that right.  That's where government comes in.

{"author":"ItLiesInTheProles","body":"You didn't answer the issue of the concentration of capital. Capital has a momentum that accumulates capital into the hands of those that own capital. Without a force of some type (government, worker organization) to serve as a counter balance to that momentum, the system accumulates then eventually bottoms out. \n\nYou did bring up another point though, which is merely and ideal form that does not have a basis in lived circumstance. You suggest that business must treat its customers well and workers well to avoid people continuing interacting with that business. And hypothetically that works. But you and I both know, dropping the ideology, how that doesn't work. If the motion of capital is centralization and accumulation, where do customers go after the competition is driven out. And what firms would exist, how will those with higher costs of labor compete with those who undercut labor? How would a brand new small town grocery store compete with the mass atomized Walmart? The iron law of wages and capital explains how as an aggregate, wages will tend to stay low, as consumers tend to buy cheaper products, and more and more industries will abide by that rule. We can see this now when people buy clothes imported from literal sweatshops; its not like people can afford union american made jeans when imported is so much cheaper, seafood hasnt stoped being purchassed despite dying ocean stocks and them being collected by literal slaves. Then, you're claiming in that scenario that workers will move to new industries, but if wages are equilized at low rates, workers can not simply move to become capitalists themselves, by what economic force do you believe in the freedom of the worker to exist and consume by free association and action? By what freedom does the worker have, are they \"voluntarily\" working as slaves?

Otherwise landlords wouldn't exist.\n\n&gt; And I'm not sure what you mean about \"acting in the interest of owners of capital\" do you have an example of that?\n\nLook at economic hitmen for an example. Privately hired actors would try to influence the leaders of a region into giving multinationals cheap access to resources and labor. If the leaders refused and couldn't be bribed, then the economic hitmen would try to assassinate or drive out the leader. If that failed, then the US military would come in and disrupt the region under the guise of spreading democracy.\n\nOne specific example from all this was the banana massacre. United Fruit (aka Chiquita), had farms in Columbia. The workers on these farms went on strike demanding 8 hour work days, 6-day work weeks, and ending food coupon compensation. So United Fruit pressured the US government into intervening on their behalf and the US threatened to invade Columbia if they didn't put an end to the strikes.\n\nThe state consistently works to benefit those that own capital and intervenes on their behalf.

{"author":"Kcinecilef","body":"Sorry for the essay but here goes: In a vacuum I'd say you're correct. Unfortunately, this is not one. Racism is a form of oppression(there's 100% a better way to term this, sorry I'm kinda rushing) which gets deep into power dynamics, history, context etc. Therefore when we speak of appropriation we ought to remember that the perpetrators are using their free will to express oppression (even if they are naive enough to think it's just fashion). There ought not to be a law against it or anything like that...that would be counter intuitive...but it should be frowned upon and educated. You shouldn't have been banned for it though.\n \nWhich leads into my other point and one of yours. Anarchy gets mislabeled, demonized and eventually thwarted by every faction relevant (including \"democracy\"). Part of how this is done is to misrepresent the essential anarchic values as something other than what they are (explaining your last point). As such it doesn't surprise me at all that the anarchist group functioning within the system of a capitalist megalith (fb) is actually what you refer to as the \"authoritarian left \" and not anarchist at all. If it was Facebook would shut it down. The AL still falls on the standard political spectrum (i.e the business spectrum) and thus despite it's extremism is still tolerable.  I guess what I'm trying to say is it might be best for you to see these forums as places where people who value anarchic tendencies gather, but that doesn't make the systems themselves or the functions within them anarchic whatsoever..so this should be expected unfortunately, and for that I'm sorry ( although I'm glad you don't seem to care about the ban :) ) \n\nfinal points:\nLiberal does not equal free\n\nClassical liberalism does value many of the same things anarchy might but a) there dont seem to be many genuine classical liberals left.b) the new various forms of liberalism have tattered and deviated so much it hardly matters if there are.There are new ideas of liberalism in the lexicon and they are here to stay.\n\nAnarchists are not liberals in any sense. Often they're just forced to work within a system (which is only occasionally somewhat liberal)  to achieve these anarchist values (often in order to protect people or to take a greater victory for progressive long-game). It's not selling out if done correctly, for the right reasons.\n\nYou can believe whatever you like and I have a certain amount of respect for the idea that anyone can do whatever they want...however I would warn that that might not be the best representation of anarchy. More it's that systems of organization and administration of things must be a) in the control of the workers\/public b) able to justify their existence.\nThose that manage to justify themselves may very well impact on your idea of universal freedom. I think at that point you sacrifice that freedom to humanity (instead of to the state or its subsidiaries as you do now) -- A community might decide it wants guns. Another might decide it doesn't. If you live with the non guns you throw a serious wrench in the plans by exerting your objective freedom and wielding a gun, especially considering those people may have chosen to employ methods aimed at limiting your \"freedom\", causing tension.   I think this is where anarchism gets complicated. Maybe you disagree with the pro guns on a million other things, or maybe you don't want to move that far away, why should you have to? For me, this isn't a fatal flaw in anarchy...merely a reason to see why no one should ever think we can be capitalist today and anarchist tomorrow. It's a process pushed by coopertive values which get founded on and enriched by the notion of valuing everybody (and their experiences) genuinely and ubiquitously.

{"author":"cyclingsocialist","body":"I'm saying that people trying to take speech away from ethnic minorities, women, children, immigrants, the poor, queer folx, disabled persons, etc. have had plenty of time to say what they want to say. It's time for them to shut up and let all the historically oppressed groups have a turn.\n\nI'm saying that *when* I speak in a political context, I want to speak with those who cannot in mind (I cannot speak *for* them, but I can be conscious of how my speak affects them). And when I speak in general, I never want to do so over the voices of those who are often the first to be drowned out.\n\nI strive to use my speech to lift people up. To hold people to a better standard. What we say, as well as what we do, doesn't exist only in the instant we say it. It carries with it the whole history of the words, our social status, our class, race, culture, and it lands on all of those things for the people who can hear us. That speech also echoes forward in time, affecting others for minutes, hours, maybe years. *All* speech must be taken in this context. And thus, we must recognize the **kinds** of speech which have a historical context of silencing dissent, of shutting out people struggling for equality.  \nWhite supremacists, fascists, bigots and the like are not struggling for equality. They're struggling against it. They are fighting to keep their positions of power **over** others. Every inch closer to equality is a blow to their power, and thus feels like an oppression to them. Hate speech is a tool they use to silence political out-groups, instilling fear of being harrassed and assailed.\n\nYou would not argue that we should go back to having separate bathrooms and drinking fountains for the sake of \"letting all sides have their fair turn\" or some other such nonsense. So why let bigots dominate conversations and discourse with notions that, supposedly, we as a society have moved beyond?\n\nWhat do we gain by critically examining white supremacist views that we don't gain more quickly by simply saying, \"you're being a fuckwad, shut up and let someone with something worthwhile to say have the floor\"? Why do we waste millions of pages of print, thousands of hours of TV and radio trying to \"discourse\" with people who unabashedly want a return to openly racist policies when we could be spending that effort having critical discussions about how to improve, say, education access in the country?  \nIt's pretty simple. We waste that time and we think it's worth it because if we faced up to the reasons things are fucked up for political out-groups, we'd wind up facing up to our own bigotry. To our own legacies of white supremacy. Because we'd find that the only way to make things truly and lastingly better would be to dismantle the very systems we've come to be so comfortable with.\n\nSo, yeah, have fun spinning my statement around and around to justify your own bullshit. While you're doing that, I'm going to be critically examining why people waste so much fucking energy crying over \"free speech\" when they could be making the world a better place.","created_utc":1525827638,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"LoganClarkPolitics","body":"Possibly long-winded comment ahead. I've got a lot to get off my chest. TLDR A short list of questions at the bottom. New account because I don't want it to be *that* easy to dox me. \n\nI've spent basically my entire adult life with one foot in radical leftist politics and the other in the very orthodox, 9-5 working world. I was a member of my local chapter of Occupy (while such a chapter still existed) and other groups working for the improvement of society, especially for the homeless. I've also served in the military and worked for the federal government.  \nThe two impulses are at constant odds with each other - My desire to be involved in positive political groups is in conflict with my desire to keep a roof over my head and food on my table. My continual state of job-insecurity exacerbates this conflict. I recognize how this conflict is itself a form of oppression, a tool which keeps me and many others like me from taking action which rocks the boat - from fully actualizing our political ideals and living our most authentic lives. I do not know how to resolve this conflict.\n\nBecause I've had to spend so much of my time searching for and holding various jobs, I've neglected to even find exactly where I lie on any political spectrum. I know I'm certainly left-of-center, but I'm not at all well versed on the merits and faults of the various leftist political philosophies e.g anarchism vs. communism vs. (democratic?)socialism. I desire to compare the various schools of thought and figure out where I stand.\n\nFinally, I want to know what I can do to take my ideals out of my head and into the streets, but I don't know where to find other like-minded individuals. The local groups with which I've worked are either anemic remnants, or have entirely dissolved. If there is an out-and-out anarchist group in my city, I don't know where they are or how to reach them. I also fear that I'm near the age where joining such a group would be difficult. Activism seems to me a young man's game, and I'm rapidly approaching 30. Lacking the real activist creds, I'm worried that any group I would find wouldn't take me seriously, or even greet me with outright suspicion (COINTELPRO) \n\nSo, with all that said, I'd like to put forward the following questions:\n\n1: How do you exist as a politically-active person, while also keeping the rent paid? Give me your personal experience - what kind of work do you do, how do you make the time to engage in political action while also holding down your job?\n\n2: I'm a wide-eyed leftist neophyte still trying to find my place in the political world. Give me the elevator pitch on anarchism, and why it is superior to all other leftist philosophies.\n\n3: How can I locate and contact any local anarchist groups? I know you can't say \"Go to XYZ Park at ABC Time and introduce yourself,\" but is there perhaps some online collective that would help me find any such groups in my city? Failing that, what are some good communities which exist online that I can join with to further my development while I continue to look for groups I can work with IRL?\n\n4: How can I, a nearly-middle aged man with a fairly modest activist r\u00e9sum\u00e9 best contribute to an anarchist group? How can I help myself be taken seriously by a group of probably suspicious and possibly deeply cynical activists?\n\n5: Is anyone here familiar with Frithjof Bergmann's *New Work, New Culture*?

Preventing that doesn't need to take the shape of laws (which nobody's really advocating here), but to be honest their legal free-speech rights are not a hill I'm willing to die on. There are a thousand more relevant struggles to take up in the name of free speech which tend to get eclipsed and ignored by the hand-wringing over Nazis, and a fair number of those involve Nazis actively silencing others.\n\nAs for where I'm from, it's Canada, and our ban on Holocaust denial has been pretty helpful over the years. Germany, while it's always had a few, was for most of the last half-century one of the least nazi-infested parts of Europe, and today is still one of the most liberal countries in the EU. There has been a big resurgence in fascists, but a lot of that follows a broader international trend striking pretty much everywhere ATM. Also worth noting is that a lot of the success of today's German fascists comes via strategies they borrowed from the US where no such bans exist, like the wave of \"End the Fed\" rallies. Poland, well, that's a pretty good example of what happens when the state allows fascism to openly organize and even embrace it - leading (just like this meme suggests) with widespread crackdowns on speech, like the \"Anti-Soros\" laws or criminalizing any suggestion that Poles participated in the Holocaust.

There's a *lot* of overlap, but they're not exactly the same issue. It's really hard to outlaw \"fascism\" - there's an argument to be made for targetting certain fascist groups like Nazis in post WW2-Germany (Germanies?) or the Klan in reconstruction-era or civil-rights era America, but overall fascism just has too many fuckin' weird esoteric variants. Those are issues that can only really be fought on the grassroots level. Genocide, though, is a slightly different issue - there's a pretty clear requirement under international law to prevent incitement to genocide (if you're one for laws...). If it actually seems plausible that a genocide could happen in the near future, serious measures need to be taken to avoid it.\n\n&gt;I'm skeptical of the claim that freedom of speech is not a good tool in the fight against genocide, and I'm unconvinced by the arguments put forward against my position, but thank you for keeping it civil. \n\nNobody's saying that free speech can't be used against genocides, just that speech can also drive them. It's a double-edged sword, and there's a point at which respecting this freedom starts to seriously interfere with the freedom of others.

In a capitalist world the numbers are often to the benefit of the capitalist world view. Productivity, GDP, quality of life figures. If anything pure numbers games only reinforce the utilitarian liberal mentality which pervades the discussion among those who are less tied to the emotional arguments for liberalism. Marx accepted most of the figures on the productivity and effects of capitalism but concluded the inevitable direction that must take it. Obviously others disagree. How can you get people to buy into anarchism on numbers when they won't buy into 'scientific socialism' based on them?\n\n\"All that matters is people are dying less than ever before\" How do you fight that with numbers?

{"author":"[deleted]","body":"It looks like every other comment has already trolled this so I\u2019ll try to give constructive criticism.\n\nThe typeface is not working with this peace.  In fact, I\u2019d go so far as to say that anarchists (especially anarchists) should avoid using any and all similar typefaces. While it\u2019s supposed to be neon lights, the breaks in the front makes it read more like cliche anarcho-punk stencil lettering.  That stencil punk aesthetic has gotten too predictable at this point and it\u2019s terribly dated and out of style. (By decades) \n\nWhile i think a totally different typeface should be used, a layer behind the text with a gaussian blur could at least make it look like the neon lights are glowing.\n\nThe color harmony is currently non existent.  Research color harmony systems and take a look at the color wheel when you go to chose your color palate.  Chose your colors according to one of the color harmony systems that works for your piece.  If figuring out a color harmony system gets to be to confusing for you, simply using complimentary colors is one way to achieve maximum contrast and add energy to a poster while maintaining a sense of unity.\nAs of right now the colors are everywhere.  For example, that blue building is distracting from the rest of the composition and doesn\u2019t fit in.  Since a majority of the poster is red hues, I\u2019d suggest maybe greens for the building if you want it to stand out. \n\nComposition makes little sense.  A diagonal line might look nice but it adds nothing to this piece.  In fact, the image of people floating above a building separated by a diagonal skyline is hard to read.  Without the text, this poster communicates absolutely nothing legible.  The entire image looks more like an after thought of images pasted together rather than a thought out composition.\n\nFinally I would either flip the image or the placement of the text, because right now, the right side of this poster is extremely heavy leaving too much negative space on the left.  The white text and the lighter blue are also competing which might make this hard to read from a distance.  If you put the text over the red-orange, it\u2019ll stand out more.\n\nThe red blob at the bottom...

Sam is the outspoken \"woke\" mixed race girl who leans into her blackness after repeated injustices at campus, but has a rather naive grasp on things and goes through a conflict of her ideals and from her peers when she falls in love with a white guy.\n\nEpisode 2 is from Lionel's pov. Lionel is a gay student reporter who is secretly in love with his roomate Troy, and is pressured to remain in the closet from the homophobia that black culture suffers from and doesn't feel comfortable with the tropes commonly attributed to \"gay\". He's rather meek and quiet often putting up with white liberals, but is finding his courage as he discovers his identity. \n\nEpisode 3 if from Troy's pov. Troy is the wealthy son of the dean being groomed for positions of political leadership within white society and has to adopt a very white personality that is at odds with his fellow black students, the at times *blatantly* racist culture of the school, and himself. He sees Sam's indignation as essentially ineffective and thinks the only way to change is within the system, but is starting to doubt that position, unsure if it's just his overbearing father browbeating that mentality into him and maybe Sam is right.  \n\nEpisode 4 if from Coco's pov. Coco is Sam's former best friend and while very attractive, is much darker than Sam, which has lead to her understanding early the white standards of beauty and the injustices faced by black folk, but where as Sam raged against it, Coco feels she can \"tone down\" her blackness to better fit into white society, which has lead to her and Sam's friendship deteriorating. She sees the injustices that black folk face and would rather just ignore it, since she can't bring herself to face it again after years of dealing with it nonstop. \n\nEpisode 5 is from Reggie's pov. Reggie is in love with Sam and full swing into black power, though they kinda suggest he partially does it to impress Sam. He's frustrated with the \"all lives matter\" white liberal college attitude, and finds himself at odds even trying to correct something as rudimentary as telling his white friend not to say \"n***a\" while singing a song, which ultimately had a pig, in an incredibly unsubtle racist moment, pull a gun on him.\n\nI would start episode 6, but I gotta finish some animation work and I am really enjoying this.

{"author":"polygraphicmemory","body":"There really isn't a great answer to this. The de facto control of a particular city\/territory\/etc. was shifting a lot after the Bolsheviks started 'doing their thing.' The Mahknovists declared themselves an army in a declaration dated Jan 7, 1920, well after the movement had been fighting and thus delineating territory so declarations often do not mean much. It was an insurrection against multiple state forces and it would have been counterproductive  to declare a border that could not be definitively held. The movement itself was beginning in April 1919, but this was after the Bolsheviks were already showing up to \"liquidate\" non-party leftists in Russia (April-the famous October of 1918). These efforts trickled into Ukraine through Nov-Dec-Jan 1919 where there had been little party influence and presence yet, which eventually came into conflict with the government there, which already had peasants organizing under it independent of the soviets in Ukraine or the Soviets in Russia (capitalizations intentional). A series of concerted uprisings began in late 1918 (I can speculate with news of the Soviets cleaning house mentioned above) and by February 1919, it had been in full factory-expropriation-land-reclaiming swing. My understanding is that they never declared independence within a set of boundaries, which fluctuated but maps do exist for given moments in time. I wish there was a hard number to give you, and it may exist, but my understanding is there isn't one that is easily determined and a historian trying to compile this information had many primary documents destroyed by the Soviets that may have shed some light on this (and other copies likely were destroyed intentionally or accidentally, lost, left behind, not considered of any value).","created_utc":1525918515,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

But I was caught with a gram of marijuana. In their infinite wisdom, the state saw it fit to jail me for several months before my case got anywhere. In that time, my parents sold the car I bought with my own money, I was kicked out of college and saddled with school loans but no degree, and ultimately charged with a $2,000 court fine + fees. I continue to pay my college loans and court fees today (I'm now in my 20s). \n\nMarijuana prohibition was lobbied via capitalism, because of course the state and the monopoly are one and the same. So while I do have a lot of resentment towards the state, not only for what they did to me but what they failed to do for any of my friends or family, I can also blame capitalism equally for these outcomes. \n\nMost people my age do not ever expect to own a home.

{"author":"Microscope98","body":"An actual answer for an actual question: People don't just wake up one day knowing how to deal with new ideas, and are always totally fucking up in their relations to each other. it's especially obvious with concepts like ablism, where most people don't understand what the hell that means, and so they can't possibly deal with it in a reasonable way. How communities deal with inequality caused by physical disparity without infinite resources? There's trade off that has to be made between the few and the many, and the basic anarchist response in my mind would be \"who gives a shit, just be gentle with each other.\" On the other hand, consider the prospect of calling somebody stupid to their face. Ain't it fighting words? I think anarchists have to be thick skinned when it comes to conversation, but especially when it comes to being ejected from a conversation, because people don't always want to hear you ranting, and in my experience, anarchists really like to rant. From an ideological perspective, this can be seen as people simply creating the conditions in which they can talk to the people they are actually trying to talk to, and turning down the volume on some of the louder voices in the room is absolutely necessary in order to hear the quiet people. Consider for a moment, that under ideal conditions, this would not be necessary, and that real circumstances prevent those conditions, then we are forced to act and converse in such a way as to create an approximation of the ideal. Perhaps that community had better things to do than listen to your ex\\-boyfriend. You clearly heard about it, so the guy definitely got heard. Meanwhile, the people he was calling stupid got to have the conversation they were trying to have without his apparently unwanted input. Is that so terrible? We're gonna get old and die someday and still won't have said everything we wanted to say to everybody we wanted to say it to.

It's a crucial part of how we operate together, and thus will always have the potential to inflict harm.

If you can reasonably predict that something you say will result in harm to someone else, then you and your words are at least partially responsible for those results. In the modern legal sense, that's only an option when you can show demonstrable harm (like lost income, etc), but it's not exactly uncommon.

For some time after his arrival he still followed the same profession. When, for instance, he saw a knot of the ruffians on the prairie, discussing, of course, the single topic which then occupied their minds, he would, perhaps, take his compass and one of his sons, and proceed to run an imaginary line right through the very spot on which that conclave had assembled, and when he came up to them, he would naturally pause and have some talk with them, learning their news, and, at last, all their plans perfectly; and having thus completed his real survey he would resume his imaginary one, and run on his line till he was out of sight. \n\n  Brilliant and bold as all hell.

If an individual was skeptical of someone yelling fire, and relied on their own senses, they wouldn't be prone to following someone who's intention was to deceive. This is true of life in general. Another thing that is importantly highlighted by your fire and work example in this discussion is not \"speech\" but deception, which can be used in speech, but is not speech itself, I could go on, but I hope you can see where I'm going with this. \n\nThere are things that can make violence less likely, and help prevent harm, which don't involve limiting speech. Counter speech, deradicalisation, encouraging skepticism, etc. \n\nThe motives of an individual are just as important in this case, for example: Lets say most people have a set of cultural beliefs that violence against one particular religious or ethnic group is stupid and barbaric? I doubt any Hitler type figure could frenzy a crowd about an ethnic group if contrary beliefs were established before it got to that.\n\n It seems to me that speech is only one part in a set of factors which aren't readily separable.\nTo blame the medium for the intention of the author, and the response of the recipient seems to me to be unreasonable.\n\nRegarding legality, the whole premise of the derived power of law, and that they have received their power from God, or nature, or kings, or \"we the people\", or somesuch nonsense, makes me skeptical of any legalism to begin with.\n\nWhen you speak of slander, there is something that isn't being mentioned which I can't highlight enough, and that is the act of the people who believe the slander.

We don't blame abusive bosses on construction jobs, we blame that on the bosses for abusive bosses.

While brothels are not perfect, they are safer than the alternatives. ^[\\[4\\]](https:\/\/www.amnestyusa.org\/files\/briefing_-_sex_workers_rights_-_embargoed_-_final.pdf).

Our department was like 13-15 people strong dont remember anymore. So it didnt take long before a worker would find somewhere else to work and when i had to go back to school after those 2 years there were only 2 people that had worked there longer than me in the department and one of those had already quit but he had to keep working for some months cause thats a right the capitalists have. But the top boss just said that it would be the same in other companies to deter us from leaving (of course it would be better in other companies)\n\nAnyways i was working on this project and it was perhaps my last project but had made an error, and the supervisor that had to check it didnt see the error (the one who was forced to work after he quit, maybe he intentionally didnt see the error) so the error got through and the whole thing got produced and then the error revealed itself. Now the whole thing had to be remade and i think the company lost some 5500 euroes because of that plus an unhappy customer. At first i felt bad about it because it wasnt on purpose but then i thought they deserved it. And they couldnt do anything about it because 1 i was under education and 2 i was so close to not being there any more anyway.","created_utc":1525968214,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"[deleted]","body":"&gt;Also, anarchism is not based on voluntary relations. The core opposition is to authority, not involuntary social relations. This is an important distinction because relations can be authoritarian yet voluntary. Voluntaryism is associated with \"anarcho\"-capitalism which is not a true form of anarchism precisely because the focus is on what is voluntary\/involuntary and not what is libertarian\/authoritarian.\n\nAnarchism is based on the removal of rulers. With no authority, a society would be completely voluntary. Voluntaryism itself has nothing to do with capitalism, socialism, communism, or any other economic system. It is only a very simple premise that all human interaction should be voluntary and free from coercion. That's literally it. Whatever economic or social system people voluntarily choose to follow is after the fact.\n\nSituations cannot be authoritarian and voluntary at the same time. If a society is truly voluntary and you choose to submit to authority, then you also have the option to choose to stop submitting to authority.

{"author":"chronicwisdom","body":"The issue I have is that most workers recieve a flat rate wage and aren't given an opportunity to truly benefit from the profits their wage produced. If you had a novel idea that produced something tangible then you should be able to profit from it perpetually. If youre a franchise operator the only thing seperating you from your employees is credit. If its a turnkey business your GM and employees produce all the value but ther person who acquired more capital from other ventures is the one who realizes the bulk of that profit. To me, that's a serious problem in distribution of profits relative to value produced.\n\nThe same goes for inheritance of private property (as opposed to inheritance of personal property which I have no problem with). You've got families like the Walton's whose creation (Wal Mart) many argues hurts American workers. Then you've got their kids (who have produced nothing of value) continue to take the lions share of the profits while refusing to provide the majority of their employees with anything more than the bare minimum standard of compensation. Plenty of retail chains survive with better employee compensation and Wal Mart is getting the best profit margin because they are ruthless with suppliers.\n\n I see the scenarios Ive described as endemic of the 'head start' problem in capitalism. An individual who starts life with capital and property they did not earn themselves can produce nothing of value and earn the majority of their business' profits. In the Wal Mart example the proportion of profit the inheritor feels entitled to has a direct impact on the ability of American workers to bargain for the fair value of their labor. \n\nThe head start problems also gives established ideas and modes of production a huge advantage over new ones. One example is the mysterious death of the electric car in the 90s. Demand was there but the auto and petro saw t as against their short term interest so the technology was put on the shelf for a decade. Theres also a huge problem with telecommunications monopolies in North America which I would attribute to the head start problem. Capitalism isnt free if large producers can delay or push out new ideas and its not competitive if many people have a massive head start over the majority of the population. These are all problems inherent in capitalism that need to be restrained by some outside force. Laissez faire capitalism and neo liberalism have proven time and again to work against the interests of the majority of the population.","created_utc":1526005328,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"DenverHoxha","body":"&gt;Let's look at your example of yelling fire in a movie theatre. If an individual was skeptical of someone yelling fire, and relied on their own senses, they wouldn't be prone to following someone who's intention was to deceive. This is true of life in general. Another thing that is importantly highlighted by your fire and work example in this discussion is not \"speech\" but deception, which can be used in speech, but is not speech itself, I could go on, but I hope you can see where I'm going with this. \n\nThe problem is that legitimate threats can and do exist which your senses wouldn't necessarily be able to assess in time. If somebody ten feet away in a dense crowd shouts \"he's got a gun\", you may only have a split second to react before it's too late. Others (like those relating to the slander examples below) you may not have the option of dismissing even if there's very little evidence. Would you leave your kids with a babysitter who was reputed to be a child molester, just because you'd personally seen no evidence that they were? Sometimes you just can't take that chance. \n\nAs for the matter of deception - is it not still speech? Would you accept that it's ok to restrict speech if it's untrue or intentionally deceitful? Who decides what's \"true\"? \n\n&gt;The motives of an individual are just as important in this case, for example: Lets say most people have a set of cultural beliefs that violence against one particular religious or ethnic group is stupid and barbaric? I doubt any Hitler type figure could frenzy a crowd about an ethnic group if contrary beliefs were established before it got to that.\n\nWhat do you do when huge chunks of the public are totally fine with violence against certain populations, tho, as they are today? Or if a group of people is working hard to make them that way? We need policies that work for the world we actually live in, not the one we would like to imagine. \n\n&gt;It seems to me that speech is only one part in a set of factors which aren't readily separable. To blame the medium for the intention of the author, and the response of the recipient seems to me to be unreasonable.\n\nNobody's blaming the medium, we're just not sanctifying it either. I'm not arguing for the thought police, just that we shouldn't take it on faith that all speech is inherently positive, or even neutral. Every case of cause and effect is complicated by real-world factors, but we find a way to sort the rest of them out, why can't we do the same for information flows?\n\n&gt; When you speak of slander, there is something that isn't being mentioned which I can't highlight enough, and that is the act of the people who believe the slander.\n\nWhile you're right, to a degree, it's important not to over-emphasize the role of other causal factors because we don't want to consider one of them for ideological reasons. This kind of logic can get into victim-blaming territory really quickly - is the author who cancels her talk after a slew of threats the one to blame? The critically ill patient who gives all their savings to snake-oil salesmen? How about in cases with people who aren't able to make informed decisions, like children or those with cognitive impairments? \n\n&gt;Thank you also for the chat, whilst I'm somewhat stubborn in my position in this topic for my own reasons, I do enjoy having my views changed in my search for truth and to converse with people across the divide. I agree that free speech isn't going to get people far if it means freedom to speak to people who think exactly the same as one's self. \n\nYou too.

The same can be said for tools such as shovels, if I am able to take a chunk of someone's side out with a shovel, does it follow that I should regulate shovels? Intentions of the user matter, this is why any call for government regulation seems absurd to me. Are we to regulate the world until we function like rigid mechanical automata? Anything can be used with malicious intent, I'm not going to allow the world to be bubble wrapped because I'm worried someone might get hurt. My freedom is more important than my safety, it's the reason I want to leave Australia. Australia is an example of a bubble wrap approach to governance, I'm sure Canada is too.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt; Would you leave your kids with a babysitter who was reputed to be a child molester, just because you'd personally seen no evidence that they were?\n\n\nThis is a hypothetical that isn't taking in to example many factors that might influence my decision, what if it was a family member? what if I knew that they couldn't have? what if an extremely well constructed counter argument existed? am I going to trust the pack animals in making judgements about my life? Every time I trust public opinion, it seems to go fairly bad for me.\n\n\n\n&gt;As for the matter of deception - is it not still speech? Would you accept that it's ok to restrict speech if it's untrue or intentionally deceitful? Who decides what's \"true\"?\u00a0\n\n\nNo, I would focus on the deception, but I wouldn't restrict it, I would punish it. I'm not a statist that I want control the lives of others.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt; What do you do when huge chunks of the public are totally fine with violence against certain populations, tho, as they are today? Or if a group of people is working hard to make them that way? We need policies that work for the world we actually live in, not the one we would like to imagine.\u00a0\n\n\nWell, you do what you have to do. If it needs to become violent in response to attacks, because you need to defend people, then so be it. That is a response to violence. Not speech. Furthermore, I don't trust government,\u00a0 nor wars of aggression, so any arguments for policy or governments isn't going to work with me. I'm almost a quietist in that sense.\n\n\n&gt; Nobody's blaming the medium, we're just not sanctifying it either. I'm not arguing for the thought police, just that we shouldn't take it on faith that all speech is inherently positive, or even neutral. Every case of cause and effect is complicated by real-world factors, but we find a way to sort the rest of them out, why can't we do the same for information flows?\n\n\nYou seem to have misunderstood my position, I'm not saying speech is positive, negative, or neutral. I'm saying speech is speech, like writing is writing, and shovels are shovels. It is a tool. My argument is against government intervention and regulation. Whether or not it's right or wrong, good or bad, are meaningless questions to me.\u00a0\n\n\n&gt;\u00a0 This kind of logic can get into victim-blaming territory really quickly\u00a0\n\n\nI am only referring to people who enact violence or malice because someone convinced them to, nothing else.\u00a0\n\nCheers\n\n\n","created_utc":1526012079,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"nyando","body":"Here's the thing. You've heard of monopolies, right? A corporation corners a market and becomes the only service provider in that area. The lack of competition allows it to set prices and conditions at its discretion.\n\nThe reason this (mostly) doesn't happen anymore is because there are anti-trust laws. They make most forms of monopolies illegal. Now assume an anarchist society, that is, absence of state authority. This also means that corporations would be free to consolidate and get rid of all competition until they are a monopoly.\n\nImagine Walmart were the only retail corporation in existence, because they either squashed or bought out all competition in the field. They could set prices as high as they want, and because there's no competitor offering cheaper alternatives, people would have no choice but to buy from them.\n\nNow imagine a corporation that has a monopoly in the field of security services. Armed escorts, public safety, that sort of thing. That corporation would be free to force anything and everything on the rest of the population, thereby creating an authoritarian structure. And just like that, an \"anarcho-capitalist\" society goes up in smoke.\n\nEDIT: Regarding your question as to what other system than anarcho-capitalism qualifies as anarchy: communism. Communism in its idealized form is, by definition, a class- and stateless society. All means of production are collectively owned, and articles of production are freely accessible to everyone according to their need. This is in contrast to any sort of capitalist society, where articles of production are distributed according to \"ability.\" Such a distribution creates inherent inequality, where the class of people who own more than they require (the \"haves\") have power over those who do not (the \"have-nots\"). This power allows haves to create a coercive structure, which runs counter to anarchy.","created_utc":1526030763,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"nyando","body":"&gt; If one company completely outperforms all of its competitors then it \u201cdeserves\u201d to reign supreme.\n\nThe problem in an anarchist context is when \"reigning supreme\" in fact does mean \"reign\". When a company becomes so powerful that it becomes a coercive structure in and of itself, you no longer have anarchy. You have corporate rule.\n\nI'm going to assume we're within a framework of anarchy, so there is no coercive structure like a state. In that context, a business is free to pursue unethical practices to rid itself of competition. Say they take up arms and shoot up the store in the next town over that offers better prices (hyperbolic, but you know what I mean). Then they take over that store and jack up prices. Some people are willing to pay a little more, so the unethical company makes good profits. Others are unsatisfied, and decide to start up a competitor. They offer fair prices, and the unethical company sees a drop in profits. However, the unethical company is still on better financial footing from their previous exploits, so they lower their prices temporarily. The strategy works, and soon the small competitor has to close down because most people prefer buying cheaper and they're not seeing any business. Pretty soon people accept that it's pointless trying to compete with these guys, since they have the means to outbid every budding competitor.\n\nNow imagine this on a national or global scale. A company that's larger than every competitor can simply starve them of business by either unethically driving them out or outbidding them until they're forced to sell or close down. Still, people (presumably) need whatever this company produces. This allows the company to charge outrageous prices and leverage the profits to further solidify their position. I realize it's not literally *impossible* to compete in this context, but wouldn't you agree it's very pointless to try and do so?","created_utc":1526032806,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

It's honestly remarkable how they could even begin to compete with the US, whose homeland was virtually untouched by the war, the one military base on Hawaii excluded.\n\nEven within the US, the most significant \"American\" innovations in that time were all driven by the USDoD and other government-funded projects.

These minions of the Pope are boldly insulting our Senators; reprimanding our Statesmen; propagating the adulterous union of Church and State; abusing with foul calumny all governments but Catholic, and spewing out the bitterest execrations on all Protestantism.

{"author":"CaniTerrae","body":"The site is named Marxists, that doesn't mean Proudhon was. Proudhon was not a Marxist.  Anarchists, by and large, **are** Communists.  Communism is **not** Marxism (Edit: Marxism is a political analytical theory created by Marx and Engels.  Communism is an ideal shared by more than just Marxists).  As for the 'blood of millions', that could be said of many things, I'm afraid.  Capitalism has the blood of millions on its hands, Christianity has the blood of millions on its hands, Britain has the blood of millions on its hands, America has the blood of millions on its hands.  The lead industry has the blood of millions on its hands.  The tobacco industry has the blood of hundreds of millions on its hands.  The alcohol industry has the blood of hundreds of millions on its hands.\n\nAgain, I'd encourage you to read actual Anarchist political theorists.  Among others;  Bakunin, Kropotkin, Goldman, Berkman, and the predecessor to Anarchist theory, who was Proudhon.  Proudhon is kind of the proto-Anarchist.\n\nThere is an important distinction to be made.  Anarchists are not against personal property.   What you actively use for your own life.  Your teddy bear, your living space, the land you yourself farm.  Anarchists **are** against private property.  Meaning your capitalist right to buy up all the damn land in the world and keep it fallow, uncultivated; when others are in need.  Or your capitalist right to 'own' the factory that hundreds work in.  Anarchists firmly do not support the right to such private property.  It is regarded as a form of tyranny.\n\nI believe if you read the Proudhon link I gave you, you might come to see how Capitalism and Anarchism are completely antithetical.  \n\nEDIT:  Oh, Marxists are also not necessarily absolute statists.  I don't know who taught you about Marxism, but you're lacking context.  I'd read more, if I were you.  \n","created_utc":1526055966,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"CaniTerrae","body":"Oh, it's not always a strawman.  If you studied the history of the Standard Oil company, for instance, you would find that corporate use of lethal force is not nearly as hyperbolic as you may think.  It's literally a matter of history.\n\nAs for your argument that it is a matter of choice, you assume a system in which alternatives are better.   Without government regulation on corporate enterprise, history shows, without much room for argument, that corporations will thoroughly and heinously abuse their employees.  Before there was a law on it, there was no minimum wage, before there was a law on it, children were worked in unsafe conditions and were often maimed, before there was a law on it, this maiming went uncompensated.  Before there was a law on it, your average work day could be as long as you boss told you it would be.  Before there was a law on it, your corporation could contract you to live inside the factory, or on site in a 'company town'.  Before there were laws on it, you lived in company housing, could be brought before a company judge, were subject to the authority of company police.  Before there was a law on it, a local monopoly **was** the law.\n\nYou assume that a person in such a situation *can* pack up and go to another company.  You're also assuming that without laws of any kind, those other companies need to be any better, at all, to their employees.   They don't. \n\nYou then went on to presume that monopolies aren't bad.  Actual Capitalist theory, per Adam Smith, abhors monopolies.  A monopoly is antithetical to actual capitalism.  No company 'deserves' to be the monopoly.  There is no 'deserving' anything for a company.   Consumers deserve that companies be in constant competition, or the entire concept of Capitalism falls through the floor.  \n\nGo look up the Ludlow Massacre and tell me that corporations don't shoot up their competition.  \n\nI believe you have a great deal to learn about economic theory.  You may wish to read Adam Smith's \"The Wealth of Nations\".  It's not a very exciting book, but it is the seminal text for your beloved Capitalism.  You will find it portrays a *VERY* different system than the one you think it does, and than the one we live in.\n\nEDIT:  The historical corporate use of lethal force was *WITHIN* the frameworks of a strong government, no less.  What do you imagine corporations would be like if there were **literally** no law whatsoever.  If they wrote their own law?  You seem to be imagining a world much like our own, except without the state, and so everyone still just lives in houses and commutes to work, and everything is peachy because you don't have to pay taxes to those pesky underprivileged people.  That's not a reality, mate.  It's a literal joke in Anarchist circles.  What you're describing is the An-Cap dream.  You're describing an Ayn Rand - Paul Ryan orgasm.  It's not a feasible reality. \n\nEDIT:  Here is the seminal work of Capitalist theory, by Adam Smith, for free, in multiple formats, online: http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/3300","created_utc":1526056620,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Not the same thing of course, but enough to get me thinking.\n\nNow, as an anarchist, I oppose the state and capitalism and all hierarchical forms of control. I am also extremely poor (I've earned less than $10k\/year for the whole 15 years I've been working). We have to do what we can to survive in a hostile system, and I ain't no lifestylist so I'm not above taking the system for everything I can. Fuck you pay me and all that.\n\nAs I walked home from my first government-sponsored grocery trip (which, by the way, felt amazing), I thought to myself \"see, everyone should have this. Give $200\/month to every person for food. We've got the money, we've got the food, just do it.\"\n\nThe problem that comes, of course, is that the system isn't run by people who think like we do. In fact, it's run by our stated enemies! Always concerned first with profit, they'll go \"I bet we could sell this ramen for 10x the price, now that everyone has a stipend!\" So there would have to be controls in place to prevent price gouging and anti-consumer behavior as much as possible... and they would never go far enough.\n\nBut... it still means people can get food easier than before.\n\nObviously, UBI has more involved to it. That money would be used for rent, utilities, gas, all kinds of stuff. The level of control required by the State would be enormous. \n\nSo what do we do? It's hard in good conscience to oppose something that would, at least for a while, really help people like me.

{"author":"a_lynnk_to_the_past","body":"A dom is not necessarily an authority in the anarchist sense. The BDSM community has spent decades creating the collective knowledge of how to prevent that situation from occurring. They just don't use the term \"authority\" to describe it since in that context it refers to the form of control and leadership that the dom has. In general, D\/s, parent\/child, and tutelary relationships share a relationship dynamic that appears to have an authority in it. Seeing this, anarchists will often say these are instances of rational or voluntary authority.  I disagree with this judgement.\n\nAn authority claims the right to command though they may not have the capacity to do so. States can enforce their right to command. The modern day Catholic church generally does not have the capacity to enforce their right, it relies on people voluntary submitting to its authority. Authority being imposed is obviously worse than voluntary authority but they have the same kind of effect. Voluntaryness is necessary but not sufficient to have a libertarian relationship.\n\nNow, in the case of D\/s and similar relationships there is a right to command but also certain obligations which take precedence over the right to command. There's a saying that \"the sub has all the power in the relationship\". This is not entirely true but it shows the intuitive sense people have that this kind of relationship is not so simple as \"one commands and the other obeys\". Instead I would say they *both* have power in the Foucauldian sense. The \"power exchange\" in a healthy D\/s relationship does not actually transfer all the power to the dom. The obligations that the dom takes on entrenches the sub's power. The dom wields their power overtly by commanding. The sub's power is typically covert and passive; they control the dom through their prior agreements. In an unhealthy D\/s relationship the dom actually does disempower the sub. For example inexperienced subs sometimes submit to control freaks who call themselves a dom to justify their behaviour. The sub may enter and leave the relationship freely, but while the relationship exists the control freak will put their controlling desires above the responsibilities they have as a dom which makes it an authoritarian relationship.","created_utc":1526074096,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Is a sub\/dom relationship in violation of anarchist principles or is it not? I would say no because participation is voluntary, and I would assume most anarchists would agree with me, and that sub\/dom relationships would be allowed within an anarchist society. Simply having the presence of a leader or authority figure does not give rise to authoritarianism. Within the frame-work of authoritarianism, one is not free to disobey the authority without consequences. In other words, there is no pretext of voluntary association. Of course this presupposes that the submissive has sufficient mental capacaties to care for their own well-being, and that the dom is not using threats of violence to coerce them into staying within a relationship. \n\nThe Catholic church is a poor example. At one time the church was supreme authority, with a monopoly on the use of force, and there was no alternative to disobeying its authority, with the consequences being imprisonment, torture, or death. The modern Catholic church obtains its power not through voluntary relationships, but through its relationship with the State and its influence on public policy, which is a hold over from days of once being supreme authority.\n\nBack to my original point, authoritarianism cannot exist within a voluntary society, which is a goal of both anarchism and voluntaryism. Within an authoritarian society, one is not free to disobey, thus the society is not voluntary. When a society is completely voluntary, only then is the individual free, and anarchism can exist.","created_utc":1526078896,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Also tolerance and withdrawal are less of an issue with kratom, both still exist, but are nothing compared to the withdrawal of pharm opiates. It's also cheap, you can get a kilo for $100 (dosages are ~5 grams), I reccomend a vendor that has a name that rhymes with Gerbil Vacation (first word starts with an H, last with an S), buy red vein maeng da (or really any red vein), it's the best for pain relief. On a sidenote, taking kratom is generally unpleasant because of the taste, so you're gonna want to buy capsules to pack it in, as well as ginger for the nausea (which isn't intense conpared to other opis, but in the beginning stages of using it for pain it can be quite irritating).

We need to understand that a communist society that doesn\u2019t exclude anyone is like telling a gay person he isn\u2019t gay. It\u2019s so finely tuned in some people (a mix of nature and nurture) to only care about themselves.\n\nNow what I would envision could also bring in some mutualism. If you want a car you go to a manufacturers run by (for example) 10 people. You offer 1000 eggs and 200 pens for a car. The salesman agrees and he splits the eggs and pens equally between all 10 of his colleagues (granted they helped make the car). This gets rid of mass production which is harmful to society and the environment and it keeps solidarity and egalitarianism. \n\nJust out of interest how would you go about forming your communist society? Would it be the normal anarcho communist way or some other way?\n","created_utc":1526145058,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Yeah ok. \n\n&gt;I see anarchism to be as destructive as Nazism\n\nYeah I can already tell you are an idiot for saying this, like how the fuck can you possibly come to this conclusion?\n\n&gt; because they're both depriving us of the most fundamental part of the human condition, which is to have a sense of purpose and drive. \n\nYeah wow, you really did go to that stupid of an argument. Anarchism, which pushes people to self actualization, maslow's highest tier in his hierarchy of needs deprives prople of a sense of purpose and drive? Telling people \"Be free! You are no longer slaves to a system, your labor and your time belong to you!\" is depriving them of a purpose? The fuck? \n\n&gt;I'm not sure anarchy itself can do away with higharchy because conditions within that ethos cannot fight against corruption and higharchy. If anything, de-regulation for self-regulation invites such a thing\n\nThis means absolutely nothing. Like what are you trying to say here? \n\n&gt; But using blockchains and other technologies to create a new industrial system can help us foster a fairer system that isn't as corrupt and can function similar to anarchism\n\nLook, I know blockchain is a really cool term thrown around a lot, but what do you think it is going to change? How is blockchain going to address the massive human rights abuses that are carried out as a part of capitalism every day. How is blockchain going to fundamentally change the means of ownership and empower workers to be free. How is the blockchain going to ensure the food, water, clothing, housing, and medicine are basic human rights and not luxuries to be sold on a market. How is blockchain going to empower women, trans people, people of color. How is blockchain going to address police violence, the militarization of the police, foreign wars, government spying, literally anything. All that computing power is going to require massive amounts of energy, eating up all of the gains by switching to solar. And where are all of the electronics going to come from for all of these sensors and devices for the internet of things? Because there are still going to be mines full of child slaves digging up those rare earth metals he talked about. How the fuck is blockchain going to help those kids? Or do they just not matter because they are poor, brown, and out of sight. Just because it is decentralizing (which it isn't really because it centralizes all data inside of data centers controlled by the googles, amazons, and facebooks of the world. Average people are not going to have the expertise to build neighborfood friendly data centers) does not mean it does anything to support anarchism. At all. Which leads me to question if you actually know anything about anarchism?\n\n&gt;only without plunging society into the stone ages. \n\nThe only school of Anarchism wanting to plunge society into the stone age are the anarcho-primitivists. And even then their point is that this return to the stone age will not be voluntary, it will be forced upon us. Like Rifkin said, we are on a collision course. We are facing the 6th extinction event of this planet. Human civilization will not survive. Digital Europe is great, but what does that do to end the big causes of global warming? Giant oceanliners are still pumping out massive amount of pollution, cows are still going to be eaten in massive amounts. We can share cars and trains and stuff cool, except those things are still pumping out carbon. He says we have 40 years to be at carbon-zero, and yet there is no way in hell his vision of digital europe is going to get us to that point. He even says in his talk multiple times that massive companies now need to figure out how to profit off of the new digital europe system. Which means that those massive companies are going to be the ones controlling and steering those ventures. They will not accept their loss of market, they cannot as capitalism is a parasitic system that requires growth. So under digital europe the same companies, maybe a few new ones, will still have all the money, own all the resources, control the entire economy. And you think they are going to just let it release to the people because blockchain? Get real. \n\n&gt;but so full of hate and disrespect for other human beings, it frightened me.\n\nAgainst fascists and people who treat humans like property.

But,if you are not frightened, if you refuse to be pushed into the groove of tradition by your parents, by your teachers, by the superficial demands of society, then there is a possibility of discovering what it is you really love to do. So, to discover, there must be no fear of not surviving.\n\nThough, I think in this case, intelligence is courage...\n\nEither way, yes. I'm not the smartest person ever, and sometimes it takes me forever to understand but I really like mathematics. And I want to go to school for it to understand it. But, there's the whole, \"If you fail, your life is probably ruined because if you don't have a degree, then you obviously don't understand it and you're unemployable.\" So, to pursue this, I see what Krishnamurti is saying here very vividly.\n\nAlso, thank you for bringing more Eastern philosophy to bear on anarchism.

Btw, be careful of amphetamine\/methamphetamine, it's fun and useful for getting work done, and can be very useful for people with ADHD like myself to complete paperwork, but that shit can get outta hand really fast. Personally, I don't use often, but when I do (like now) I have no self control and take as much as I possibly can (which is out of character for me since I tend to be very responsible with other drugs), this is dangerous and every time without fail I get terrible heart palpitations and stay awake for many days at a time (which results in near psychosis at the end). Despite over a year of infrequent (less than 1 day\/week) usage with no tolerance buildup, amphetamine has continued to put me in danger even when I take precautions beforehand. Also you're right with how addicting kratom is, I'd put it in between cannabis and dextromethorphan for addictive potential, although addiction itself comes with few serious side effects (dependence, low testosterone and constipation are the only ones I can think of right now), so it's probably just above weed in terms of the health effects of addiction, but in chronic pain patients it's hard not to be addicted to both of these (as cannabinoids and opioids are realistically the only classes of drugs that can be used to treat intense pain daily without significant impairment), so in that case the addiction isn't necessarily bad since it raises the quality of life of the patient.","created_utc":1526179268,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"CaniTerrae","body":"Welcome! Thinking of Anarchism, eh? I will attempt to describe my understanding of it.\n\nAnarchism is fine with personal property.  That which you, yourself, use and consume is yours.  Anarchism tends to draw a distinction between this and the notion of private property.  The example I often use for this is owning more land than you, yourself, use.  Say you owned one hundred acres of farm land and only cultivated one acre.  All one hundred acres you own are private property, but only the one acre you cultivate would be considered personal property.  Anarchism, as far as I have read it, would not recognize your ownership of the other ninety nine acres.  They would be used, as needed, by other people.\n\nTrade is an issue that, in Anarchist FAI Spain, was organized on a largely voluntary basis, to my knowledge.  There was no common currency, or need for such in a transaction.  If you wanted beef, you picked up two pounds of beef from the butcher.  You paid him nothing.  He in turn, if he needed shoes, went and acquired a pair of shoes.  He paid nothing. \n\nMany socialist systems I have studied advocate for a society beyond currency transactions or barter.  One works to produce for the common consumption, and one consumes as he desires.\n\nI feel it is worth noting that Anarchism has many theories as to how it would be structured and function, but there are historical examples to look to.  There was, for a short period, the Paris Commune, which was Anarchist.  All of Paris was an Anarchist enclave for a few months, until external forces destroyed it.  Spain, in 1936 and 1937 was largely an Anarchist country, until that structure was also destroyed by external forces.  Many Anarchists would argue that Anarchism is the innate and natural form of human social interaction, pointing to the Hadza and other hunter-gatherer bands that have no government, no law, and are largely egalitarian in nature.\n\nI tend to view Anarchism as advocating for a horizontal democracy in which authority must justify its existence to the people.  That this democratic single class forms the basis of, and execution of, authority in society. Anarchism can, however, take many forms.\n\nEdit:  This poem prefaced one of the first works on Anarchism I read, I find it moving and it seems as proper an introduction as any to the poetic principle of Anarchism.  https:\/\/goo.gl\/images\/uMKYJb","created_utc":1526210454,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Again, I'm very much against conservatism because I think their beliefs infringe on other people's rights to be who they want to be, but I'm just confused by this paradox.

I mean, doesn't your actions impede on other people's beliefs and values?  And if that's the case then isn't everyone a fascist?

{"author":"Telkk","body":"Sorry, I should clarify my thoughts.  I believe, and of course I could be wrong so please counter this point and try to change my mind!  But I believe that anarchism is about freeing people from a capitalistic system that has essentially brainwashed people into oppressing themselves and therefore, until we do away with this system entirely and create a more egalitarian society where needs and wants are met through collective sharing and cooperation from others, then we'll always live under the time of super powerful people who set the agenda and define who we are as people and the values we should have.  Am I sort of right?\n\nEither way, what I meant by that statement was that it seems, at least on the surface that at the core of anarchy it's about doing away with everything and replacing it with a more organic system that relies on mass participation and sharing (good faith from others).  But this is confusing to me because I thought that part of the reason why we're in this mess is because elites have de-regulated the market economy, which invited corruption and monopolies to thrive at the expense of people?  In an anarchictic system it seems that this would be an environment, which would best suit elites who want everything de-regulated. \n\nNow regarding forcefully oppressive I just have to base it off of what I've experienced and seen in media (of course you can't trust media).  Buuut, you can or at least should trust your friends, right?  Well, I used to hang out with radical anarchists a lot, and many of these people went on to become leaders of Antifa and other groups.  Although it was great getting to know different people I couldn't help but feel bitter towards them because their minds were filled with so much hate and the way they were trying to, \"change the world\" was obnoxious and just completely foolish.  \n\nThey alienated people because they saw everyone as the enemy and they always sought to stamp out offensivness as they equated it to oppressivness and all that did was foster an environment that made it uncomfortable and often times threatening to speak your mind, which was okay for me because I liked to listen and have an open mind.  But jeez.  The way they hurt others around them.  It just made me feel betrayed by my peers and sad to see some of the very strong merits to anarchism fall to the wayside.  There are billions of people out there who will never know what you guys know in large part because of our old modes of governing things, but with regards to America at least, a fundamentally large part of that has to do with the agents within the movement.  They're dicks!  And that's putting it lightly.  No one wants to be around people like that, even if they have the million dollar idea that's gonna save everyone.

{"author":"Benjbear","body":"Whilst reading this keep in mind its a very shallow break down of everything for sake of clarity, lots of the thing's I'll say are actually hotly debated.\n\nDaoism as a philosophy emerged very much along side Confucianism and the two constantly debated (along with many other philosophies).\n\nWhen it comes to politics, in very general terms, Confucians generally thought in more authoritarian ways. Even though it is a massively distorted version of Confucianism, lots of our stereotypical images of China can be linked to Confucianism (such as, if your dad was a carpenter you will also be a carpenter. Or respecting your ancestors. Or intense adherence to social expectations)\n\nDaoism ran completely the other way, being essentially anarchist in nature. The two most famous works of Daoism, the Dao de Ching and the Chuang Tzu both reflect this but in very different ways (both between each other but also within themselves, as the chapters within each book are probably written by different people).\n\nWhere as the Confucian wants to instate humaneness and righteousness over the people, the Daoism wants none of that. The Daoist thinks that its by forcing this down peoples throats that we have these problems in the first place. The Daoist rejects the idea of \"just wanting to do good for others\" as a good method to ruling. I largely agree to this because I do think that most rulers probably thought they had the peoples best interests at heart. Anyways I'll share a couple passages from the Chuang Tzu to give an idea of the Daoist way of thinking. \n\n\"Ts'ui Chu inquired of Old Longears, saying, \"If you do not\ngovern all under heaven, how can you make men's minds good? \"\n\"You must be careful not to disturb men 's minds,\" said Old\nLongears. \"When constrained, the human mind becomes depressed;\nwhen encouraged, it becomes elated. Whether through\ndepression or through elation, the human mind may be imprisoned\nor killed. It is so soft that it can be worn down by what\nis hard and strong, yet its angles are sharp enough to chisel or\ncarve. Its heat is like scorching fire, its cold is like solid ice. The\n93\nmind may be so agitated that, in an instant, it has twice reached\nout beyond the four seas. At rest, it is deep-seated and calm. In\naction, it is remote as the sky. Ardently proud, it is not to be tied\ndown. Such is the human mind!\"\n\n\"Long ago, the Yellow Emperor disturbed the minds of men with\nhumaneness and righteousness. Consequently, Yao and Shun\nworked themselves to the bone, till there was not a hair left on\ntheir legs, toiling to nourish the bodies of all under heaven. They\ntormented their five viscera with the exercise of humaneness and\nrighteousness; they depleted blood and vital breath to set up\nlaws and regulations, but still there were some who would not\nsubmit. For this reason, Yao and Shun banished Huan Tou to\nMount Ch'ung, expelled the Three Miao tribes to Sanwei, and\nexiled Kungkung to Yutu. This shows that they could not make\nall under heaven submit. Their ways were practiced down to the\nkings of the Three Dynasties, by which time all under heaven\nwere in a great panic.\nOf the lower type of character\nthere were Chieh and Footpad;\nOf the higher type of character\nthere were Tseng Shen and Shih Ch'iu;\nAnd finally the Confucians and the Mohists arose.\nAs a result,\nThe happy and the angry doubted each other,\nThe stupid and the wise cheated each other,\nThe good and the bad censured each other,\nThe boastful and the sincere jeered at each other,\nSo that all under heaven declined.\n\nGreat integrity became disparate, so that nature and destiny were\ndissipated. All under heaven were fond of knowledge, so that the\nhundred clans were bewildered. Thereupon,\nAxes and saws were used to control them,\nRopes and cords to kill them,\nHammers and chisels to execute them.\nAll under heaven were reduced to a riot of great confusion. The\ncriminal cause of all this was the disturbing of men's minds.\nTherefore, worthy men hid themselves away at the foot of great\nmountains and rugged cliffs, while lords of ten thousand chariots\ntrembled with anxiety in their ancestral halls.\nIn the present age, the bodies of those who have been\nexecuted lie pillowed upon each other, those who are forced to\nwear shackles and cangues bump into each other on the roads,\nand those who have been tortured and mutilated gaze upon each\nother in the markets, while the Confucians and Mohists begin to\nswagger and gesticulate among the fettered and manacled masses.\nAi! This is too much! Their shamelessness and impudence are\nsimply too much! Why haven't we realized that the knowledge of\nthe sages may well be the bars of shackles and cangues, that\nhumaneness and righteousness may well be the rivets of fetters\nand manades? How do we know that Tseng Shen and Shih Ch' iu\nmay not be whistling arrows that presage a tyrant like Chieh or a\nRobber Footpad? Therefore it is said, \"Abolish sagehood and\nabandon knowledge, and all under heaven will be well governed.\"","created_utc":1526224539,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

For me personally, my path towards anarchism came directly from Eastern Philosophy. I want to try and bring attention to Eastern Philosophy a lot more on this sub. A few of the biggest ideas I find that are important:\n\n-Internal as well as external rejection of hierarchies. Generally in spirituality we focus solely on internal affairs, and in anarchism we focus almost solely on external affairs. I think that bringing attention to the need to tame your own mind in order to bring out change in the world is actually very important. The big difficulty here is that telling people to solve things internally can very easily come across as dismissive towards the realities of the world. I want to try and find a way to stress the importance of self fulfillment whilst not diminishing the need for social change.\n\n-I think lots of the \"struggle of power\" between Confucianism and Daoism is actually very relevant to today. By looking at the way these two philosophies interchanged and argued with each other I think we can learn a lot about the more modern Capitalism vs Socialism. Many of the debates between Daoism and Confucianism basically dumb down to authoritarianism vs liberalism. \n\n-Daoist and Buddhist views on nature, not as a thing to be saved but as a sort of universal truth. I find that our modern conception of nature is very dualistic. Its either \"Man overcomes nature\" or \"Men lives within Nature\". I believe it should be focused more on \"nature and man are one and the same\".

Thank you for the information you've provided btw.\n\nThat's interesting too.  That first part where you describe anarchist society.  It sounds a lot like the internet, which has been very liberating for the human race.  But it's created an unforseeable consequence.

I guess I'm just trying to say that if we are to allow others to say what they please, as people, we shouldn't alienate others because of what was said.  Instead it should be about their actions and we should draw the line at harming others.  I don't mean offending others or micro aggressions.  I mean when someone actively tries to oppress or harm another person physically.\n\nI know a lot of the alt right are racists and there are oppressive laws put in place, but people are more complicated than groups and just because someone holds more conservative views, that doesn't mean they're inherently oppressive or dangerous.  There's a lot of conservatives out there who really just want to live normal lives with a wife and kids and be around people they like and sometimes that's the token black guy who grew up as a Jehovah witness, but that whole life style?

Have you ever hung out with someone who is so fucked up they've killed someone because they suffer from extreme shame and self-loathing?  \n\nPeople are complicated man.  The world is complicated, which means understandinf the problems we face is complicated.  And if you just dwell within your own political beliefs, your own culture, your own people, you'll lose sight of everything.  And you'll learn to hate an invisible monster that in part exists, but isn't nearly as prevelant or detrimental as your group might have you believe. \n\nI used to think the World was more dangerous than it actually is.  I used to think people were worse than they actually are, but I've realized over the years that people aren't really that dangerous.  They're just scared and ignorant.  That's what's dangerous and it exists everywhere.  I don't believe you should give up your beliefs.  I just think you should stop thinking that everyone who doesn't believe what you believe to be the enemy and instead just let things flow.  We're gonna work it out, but it won't happen if we just start calling our neighbors the enemy and attacking them.  \n\nThis whole notion of defending yourself against real threats is just hogwash.  I'm not saying there aren't racist monsters who wish to kill you or me for that matter.  I'm just saying it's probably not as big of a problem as you might think and I think you think this way because you only read and watch what you believe will reinforce your assumptions about society.

People join unions and co-ops out of enlightened self-interest, but protest militants and expressive hobbyists only have ideas to offer. So, they have to distinguish themselves from each other philosophically however they can. They\u2019re competing, after all, for an extremely small pool of recruits...\n\nThe author, and a lot of Marxists I see online, conceive of struggle as almost strictly a matter of winning over as many people as possible into their belief system, with the idea that they're building a unified revolutionary body (which, of course, must be guided by their analytical frame) that can then build the infrastructure for the revolution. That's their marker for progress. In the extreme of this, as with this author, antifa can't exist as a form of protest which *isn't* meant to work towards the revolution explicitly (just to stop fascists), it only makes sense to them as sectarian competition for recruits. \n\nDespite the author's insistence that \"the more emphasis a group places on idea-based lines of demarcation, the more likely it is that there\u2019s some feature of its social existence that leads it to an idealist consciousness\", they are unwilling to entertain formulations of revolution that don't fall into their strict predisposition. Thus, leftists working towards other goals simply or who envision revolution differently, or who even have a different sociological framework for analyzing the world,  \"never have an actual material stake in their work\".\n\nDespite the author's ostensible opposition to idealism (which is fucking stupid anyway if you ask me), they can not step outside the bounds of their own belief system to consider the motivations that other leftists operate under (but don't worry, they're a materialist, so they know what you're doing better than you do). Their opposition to \"activist networking\" isn't found strictly in a critical examination of its methods, its founded in a disdain for leftists that don't envision revolution the same way they do.\n\nThey mask their disdain for a plurality of ideas and tendencies in the language of \"materialism\", and its fucking bullshit.

What is new in recent times is that we moved to a classical liberal approach of homesteading, which necessitates that ['enough and as good is left in common'](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lockean_proviso), and while that's practically impossible, it did make clear that owners very much have obligations towards non-owners, and on terms that leave non-owners no less autonomy and freedom to make bad choices than what owners enjoy. As much as that deal seems to be increasingly off as political power concentrates, as playing favorites with owners seems to become more and more rewarding and dependable for short term self interest.\n\nIf anything, I see an opportunity in renewing of political strength that radiates from individuals (decentralizing power), democracy. After all, as long as people aren't short on items required for physical subsistence (of which we can can produce, commission on individual demand and make available quite an abundance, with a e.g. basic income that finances itself from rental income streams), a majority of people might as well share the notion I experience that a cirumstance of fairness for all people is enjoyable.

Living without such action does not mean that we live like vegetables. Conflict is our main concern.

Taoism and Buddhism are both filled with anarchistic thought but I don't see them on here often, I'm trying to change that. Here are a couple of example passages from the Chuang Tzu (Daoism):\n\n\"Long ago, the Yellow Emperor disturbed the minds of men with humaneness and righteousness. Consequently, Yao and Shun worked themselves to the bone, till there was not a hair left on their legs, toiling to nourish the bodies of all under heaven. They tormented their five viscera with the exercise of humaneness and righteousness; they depleted blood and vital breath to set up laws and regulations, but still there were some who would not submit. For this reason, Yao and Shun banished Huan Tou to Mount Ch'ung, expelled the Three Miao tribes to Sanwei, and exiled Kungkung to Yutu. This shows that they could not make all under heaven submit. Their ways were practiced down to the kings of the Three Dynasties, by which time all under heaven were in a great panic. Of the lower type of character there were Chieh and Footpad; Of the higher type of character there were Tseng Shen and Shih Ch'iu; And finally the Confucians and the Mohists arose. As a result, The happy and the angry doubted each other, The stupid and the wise cheated each other, The good and the bad censured each other, The boastful and the sincere jeered at each other, So that all under heaven declined.\n\nGreat integrity became disparate, so that nature and destiny were dissipated. All under heaven were fond of knowledge, so that the hundred clans were bewildered. Thereupon, Axes and saws were used to control them, Ropes and cords to kill them, Hammers and chisels to execute them. All under heaven were reduced to a riot of great confusion. The criminal cause of all this was the disturbing of men's minds. Therefore, worthy men hid themselves away at the foot of great mountains and rugged cliffs, while lords of ten thousand chariots trembled with anxiety in their ancestral halls. In the present age, the bodies of those who have been executed lie pillowed upon each other, those who are forced to wear shackles and cangues bump into each other on the roads, and those who have been tortured and mutilated gaze upon each other in the markets, while the Confucians and Mohists begin to swagger and gesticulate among the fettered and manacled masses. Ai! This is too much! Their shamelessness and impudence are simply too much! Why haven't we realized that the knowledge of the sages may well be the bars of shackles and cangues, that humaneness and righteousness may well be the rivets of fetters and manades? How do we know that Tseng Shen and Shih Ch' iu may not be whistling arrows that presage a tyrant like Chieh or a Robber Footpad? Therefore it is said, \"Abolish sagehood and abandon knowledge, and all under heaven will be well governed.\"\n\nThere are some problems of compatibility between spirituality and anarchism, but I think most of these problems are in the eyes of the beholder not the philosophies themselves. For example, spirituality often emphasizes self change over social change, but this does not mean that the philosophies aren't compatible with political change. Its more so that for your own personal happiness, spirituality is the most immediate relief you have at your disposal, and that you have a duty to be as equanimous as possible so as to better serve the people around you.\n\nBut for many the philosophies will come across as dismissive and apathetic. \n\n","created_utc":1526242522,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Cyclideon","body":"The fundamental problem with authoritarian society is that our lives don't belong to us. We are beaten over the head with authority from the second we're born to the second we die. The family, the school, capitalism, fundamentalist religion, and the state are all part of it. We're constantly monitored and attacked by people and institutions that think they're better than us, and that we exercise almost no control over. The result is violence (physical and structural) against us, against our friends and family, and even against people on the other side of the world. This is consistent with authority.\n\nWe want to get rid of authority, and create anarchy. Without authority, people can organize how they like, completely equal and completely free. As opposed to the uniformity of authoritarian society, anarchy will be extraordinarily diverse. People can come together over common interests --- anything from economic interests to things like art or science --- that might not have been possible for them in the past, and with the power to determine how they will do so and to what end. We can enjoy greater peace, prosperity, and understanding through free association and agreement. Granting authority to a person or institution will never do that.\n\nFor a general overview of anarchism, you can consult the [Anarchist FAQ](http:\/\/www.infoshop.org\/an-anarchist-faq\/).\n\nIf you're coming from a capitalist POV, you might be interested in these works:\n\n* [General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century](http:\/\/fair-use.org\/p-j-proudhon\/general-idea-of-the-revolution\/) by PJ Proudhon\n\n* [The Economics of Anarchy](http:\/\/praxeology.net\/DL-EA.htm) by Dyer Lum\n\n* [The Iron Fist Behind the Invisible Hand](https:\/\/c4ss.org\/content\/19702) by Kevin Carson\n\n* [Organization Theory](https:\/\/www.mutualist.org\/sitebuildercontent\/sitebuilderfiles\/otkc11.pdf) by Kevin Carson.\n\n* [Markets Not Capitalism](http:\/\/radgeek.com\/gt\/2011\/10\/Markets-Not-Capitalism-2011-Chartier-and-Johnson.pdf) by Charles Johnson and Gary Chartier\n\n* [Individual Liberty](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/benjamin-tucker-individual-liberty) by Benjamin Tucker\n\n* [What Is Mutualism](https:\/\/www.panarchy.org\/swartz\/mutualism.index.html) by Clarence Lee Swartz\n\nIf you want to branch out further, try these:\n\n* [The Conquest of Bread](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/petr-kropotkin-the-conquest-of-bread) by Peter Kropotkin\n\n* Fields, Factories, and Workshops by Peter Kropotkin (I'd recommend [this version](https:\/\/c4ss.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/FactoriesPDF.pdf) released by C4SS)\n\n* [Anarchism and Other Essays](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/emma-goldman-anarchism-and-other-essays) by Emma Goldman\n\n* [Now and After](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/alexander-berkman-what-is-communist-anarchism) by Alexander Berkman\n\n* [Anarchism and Anarcho-Syndicalism](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/rudolf-rocker-anarchism-and-anarcho-syndicalism) by Rudolph Rocker\n\n* [Black Anarchism: A Reader](http:\/\/www.blackrosefed.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Black-Anarchism-A-Reader-4.pdf) by Black Rose\n\n* [Anarchy in the Town](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/anarchist-people-of-color-anarchy-in-the-town) by APOC\n\n* [Anarchy and the Sex Question](https:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=4MNHDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT16&amp;lpg=PT16&amp;dq=anarchy+and+the+sex+question&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YXDymP0Z_n&amp;sig=z_VtM9dfE07CQWtR08e3LwchTl8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqhe_nloDWAhXsz4MKHSt-CxUQ6AEIUjAH#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) edited by Shawn Wilbur\n\n* [Until All Are Free: Black Feminism, Anarchism, and Interlocking Oppression](https:\/\/anarchiststudies.org\/2016\/12\/15\/until-all-are-free-black-feminism-anarchism-and-interlocking-oppression-by-hillary-lazar\/) by Hillary Lazar\n\n* [The Unique and Its Property](https:\/\/libcom.org\/files\/Stirner%20-%20The%20Unique%20and%20Its%20Property.pdf) by Max Stirner\n\n* [Against History, Against Leviathan](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/fredy-perlman-against-his-story-against-leviathan) by Fredy Perlman\n\n* [Post-Left Anarchy: Leaving the Left Behind](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/jason-mcquinn-post-left-anarchy-leaving-the-left-behind) by Jason McQuinn\n\n* [The Bankruptcy of Beliefs](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/ricardo-mella-the-bankruptcy-of-beliefs) &amp; [The Rising Anarchism](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/ricardo-mella-the-rising-anarchism) by Ricardo Mella\n\n* [On Synthesis](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/voline-on-synthesis) by Voline\n\nYou can also browse the [Anarchist Library](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/special\/index) for just about any subject you like.","created_utc":1526246300,"score":9,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

If you take this kind of thought process to its logical conclusion, then you have to admit that all private property is also theft. You mention consent in your OP too. Like, when did we ever consent to most of the vast swathes of land in the world being owned by a relatively small portion of its people? When did we consent to rich people owning most of the food and shelter and selling it to us, forcing us to sell 40+ hours of our lives each weak into shitty jobs we'd rather not do, just so we don't starve or freeze? The answer is no one consented to these things. These systems all came about through the use of force. Look up the enclosure laws.\n\nI believe anarchists take the notion of consent a lot further than you suggested in the OP, leading to a consistent and sensible libertarianism. What \/u\/Surrendernuts is implying in his response here is the anarchist notion of \"freedom of association\". When did we all consent to the constitution? Why do we follow some rules written down by a bunch of rich white guys centuries ago who have no idea who we are or how we live today? It's completely illogical. We should instead have a diverse set of voluntary organisations which people could choose to join, rather than be forced to. These would operate on various levels and interact with each other to achieve large scale goals.\n\nThe organisations would be whatever organisations you need for your daily life that you decide to be a part of, that no one has forced you to be a part of (unlike modern states). There is no explicit prescription for how this has to work, because people should be free to organise with each other by whatever way they choose to - freedom of association, completely consensual interactions. As such, you could have agricultural production and distribution unions, construction and housing organisations, childcare collectives, a cinema club, whatever you want. And these things could be organised democratically, by consensus, by elected committee. It depends how people work things out for themselves. Large scale versions of such things have existed and still do. There are some large federations of industrial unions, worker co-operatives. A good current example of a society where many spheres of life are democratically organised locally and federated at scale is Rojava in Kurdish Syria. I'd look up some information on them for ideas on how this could work in practice.\n\nYes, we all support capitalism, even if we are not capitalists. There is no escaping it because the entire infrastructure of the global economy is based on capitalism. One would need to live in the desert or the outback away from any human intervention to not support capitalism in some way or other. The thing is, you have probably been part of an anarchist organisation many times in your life already too. Whenever you do something with other people without being forced to by an armed state power, or without demanding payment for any exchange that occurs, that is how we would like all things to operate. So when you make dinner for your friends, help your neighbours out by shoveling snow or mowing their lawn, go to feed your aunt's or coworkers cat, you have just taken part in a \"solidarity economy\" and you either screwed someone over or got screwed over by not charging\/being charged, and the government got no tax dollars. If our entire economy operated this way, then no extra labour would need to be performed to pay for the government's taxes or corporate profits, and the large bureaurcracies required to maintain them. It would actually be a lot more efficient.\n\nA book I would suggest to understand the context of anarchist ideas through their evolution and what kind of organisations are implied by anarchist principles is [Anarchism: from theory to practice by Daniel Guerin](https:\/\/libcom.org\/library\/anarchism-daniel-guerin). I found it useful to get a solid understanding of the basic economic\/organisational framework when I was first learning about anarchism.","created_utc":1526257260,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Racism and misogyny are used to disenfranchise and exploit non-white and non-male people in society. There is a lot to be said on this, go read some basic literature.\n\n&gt; If you consider people who are trying to maintain their sense of how the Country should run to be fascists, then doesn't that make you fascist since you're trying to maintain and foster your own sense of how a country should run?\n\nNo. This is a fascist talking point. Look up the paradox of tolerance.\n\n&gt; I mean, doesn't your actions impede on other people's beliefs and values?\n\nSelf-defence when protecting your right to self-determination is very different to an act of aggression which actively seeks to deny you of any rights you would assert to have.\n\n&gt; Am I a fascist because I believe in some form of regulated capitalism that's embedded within a sharing economy?\n\nFascism is certainly a loosely used term around here. I would not say you are. But you are definitely not on the side of the anarchists and therefore closer in cause with the fascists. But people are more likely to believe you would sympathise with fascism because of the fact that you are supporting their views and talking points (see my response to the \"anti-fascists are the same as fascists\" point above)\n\n&gt; Or am I a fascist because I believe in anarcho-capitalism instead of anarchism?\n\nI'm gonna have to say yes on this one. Because anarcho-capitalism is just loony nonsense that only bootlickers could appreciate.\n\n&gt; Who are your enemies and what are anarchists willing to do to their enemies?\n\nRead basic literature - any history of anarchism or introduction to its ideas.\n\n&gt; What is the end goal of anarchism?\n\nHeard of google?

It's unavoidable. You simply can't make 7.6 billion people into committed anarchists, any more than you can make them communists, or liberals, or whatever. We shouldn't have an attitude of marching into every other place authority exists and overthrowing it --- it feels like an anarchist version of regime change. Anarchy needs to grow naturally out of people's needs and conditions.\n\nI think this is where panarchy comes into play. If possible, we should try to cultivate peaceful relations with people who aren't anarchists. That could involve each party agreeing not to interfere with each other, or intermingling and cooperating on a voluntary basis while retaining their independence. While not everybody involved is an anarchist, I think the relationship itself would be quasi-anarchic.\n\nWhen it comes to how anarchists relate to indigenous people, this is very important. We have to carefully take into account the legacy of European and American imperialism, and all the ways which colonial authority continues to affect indigenous people everywhere. \n\nWe are not affected by authority in an indigenous community in anywhere near the same way we're affected by the state or capitalism. In terms of land, I don't think anarchists are in a good place to impose certain property-and-exchange relations on anybody, let alone on people who have a deep relationship with the land (and vice-versa) that can't be summed up by the rhetoric of property. If we imagine a field that seems vacant to us, but holds significance for a nearby indigenous community, we could theorize anarchists and members of that community forming an agreement on the field (i.e. out of respect for boundaries, anarchists shouldn't try to use it for their own ends).

These young men are not necessarily undergoing systematic oppression but are certainly struggling nonetheless in this very alienating world which we find ourselves in and they often feel the left only villainises them. Jordan Peterson offers them some kind of prescription of how to live a virtuous life and regain their masculinity in these times.

As I pointed out in my first comment, you are doing work for other people all the time without any hierarchical incentive - cooking dinner for a loved one, holding the door for a stranger. Throughout history, most productive work has been done in this way, not under coercion. In that first comment, I also told you to look up Rojava for a currently operating example of a large scale (several million people) economy structured in a way that people do productive work largely without social hierarchy or profit motive. Have you read about that yet before coming back to me with these comments? No? Didn't think so. That's why I may not be treating you with the utmost respect right now - stop acting surprised\/offended about this. I'm the one that should be bothered that you can't follow through with your claim of wanting to learn.\n\n&gt; actual capitalism\n\nThis is it. There is no other way capitalism works. There is no functioning \"pure\" Friedman\/Rothbard\/Randian system. See my points about dictatorships installed by the US above for recent examples of when this was attempted.\n\nIf you want to understand the economy and capitalism, you need to look at the history of how these systems developed. If you read anything out of all the materials that were suggested to you in here, you should read [this book](https:\/\/libcom.org\/files\/__Debt__The_First_5_000_Years.pdf) or get the audiobook [here](http:\/\/www.unwelcomeguests.net\/Debt,_The_First_5000_Years). It goes into great (but entertaining) detail of how the economic systems of societies evolved from the earliest times of civilisation until today. It also does so without talking too much about ideology - it is an anthropological text. You see from historical development that there cannot be any other way that things could have went and that \"pure\" capitalism has been tried and cannot work. It outlines in simple but undeniable terms why economics as we are taught to understand it is not really a reflection of how economies work, how American capitalism doesn't exist in a bubble and absolutely relies on foreign military activity to operate.\n\n&gt; Unemployment is as low as ever in the US, and we haven\u2019t given up much to achieve it.\n\nYes we have. Look into how this \"unemployment\" is defined or look at the kinds of jobs on offer. More and more people are hired for contract work or through temp agencies. No stable work in the long term and no benefits. People are more precarious than ever.\n\nAnd again, if opportunities were really opportunities, why can't you explain the graphs from the NY Times article I linked two comments ago that show that only rich people have any appreciable chance of getting rich? You are grasping. You don't want to change your mind. You should stop pretending that you do or start reading the facts we're offering as arguments. I used to think the things you think when I didn't know the facts. Your arguments are not new to me, they are the standard things we are taught to support the system. But I eventually changed my mind to think what I think now because I went deeper into the history and the facts are just not in your favour. You can't convince an anarchist to your side because we came from your side, why would we go back? You can either stay there or open your mind and get over here.\n\n&gt;  full automation\n\nAutomation is great but we will never automate everything.

{"author":"TheEdenCrazy","body":"You don't understand what open-source is lol. It's about letting people see the source of software or hardware to ensure no-one is doing anything malicious.\n\nI have explained why it isn't capitalistic already. Having access to technology allows people to not be held down by capitalistic structures and can make it easier to live without them.\n\n\nThe only reason you think it is capitalistic is because you think that there would be an incentive for highly modified people to subjugate those who aren't, which only exists in a capitalist, non-automated society. It depends on people having to do huge amounts of work, where robot bodies would enhance that, and where the profit gained from doing work allows you excess power over others. \n\n\nPragmatically, however, hard labour can be automated.\n\n\nAlso I'm not neurotypical. You use that word like it's some kind of insult. And I'm not a right-wing libertarian, either. I'm not right wing, I'm literally an anarcho-communist.\n\n\n&gt; Nature does not exist and has no hierarchy.\n\n\nWell. Nature does exist. It is reality, the environment, and the creatures in it. It also absolutely does have hierarchy - please inform me how \"predator and prey\" is not a hierarchy.\n\n\n&gt; 'Robotic uploading' is not desirable or possible, you Platonist.\n\n\nWhy is it not possible? The mind is merely an emergent property of interactions between neurons. There is no evidence to suggest otherwise. Hence all that it takes to transfer a mind is to emulate the way neurons interact with each other. There is hence no evidence to suggest transferring a mind is impossible.\n\n\n&gt; &gt;  progress will fix it\n\n\n&gt; You may as well be a posadist with that fantasy.\n\n\nWell, its fixed a ton of problems in the past and present, and seems to continue doing so at an accelerating rate.\n\n\nIt has saved billions from starvation. It has fuelled the increasing energy demands of humanity at decreasing environmental cost (and the continuing renewable adoption will further reduce, if not eliminate, environmental energy problems). It has created the greatest and most powerful communications network ever made. It has created machines capable of simulating universes. It has eradicated or near-eradicated diseases which have been a scourge on humanity and the world for our entire history in a matter of decades. It allows people to survive and thrive even with otherwise debilitating physical and mental illness or neurodivergence which used to be taboo\/hated until science shed light on its causes. We can literally *design* life and are near a point \nwhere we can enable anyone - even same-sex or infertile couples - to reproduce. And genetic engineering means we can make plants that can be farmed with far less environmental damage. At some point in the future, we will have the technology to allow people to live indefinitely and liberate ourselves from the ultimate scourge of all: Death.\n\n\nNow, the key thing we have to avoid is letting capitalism hinder these technologies and\/or leave them in the hands of only the ultra wealthy. We also need to try to avoid having these technologies be used to exploit people, by allowing everyone access to them. If only a few get access (as in capitalism) then we end up with an elite. If no-one is allowed access (like you are proposing), then the first person to break those rules (which also violate the right to morphological freedom and bodily autonomy by the way) would have a massive advantage and dominate society.","created_utc":1526314079,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

There's still thousands and they're still willing and able to put up a fight. \n\n&gt;You tend to have to give up urban areas with all the productive areas or get bombed.\n\nAs fucked up as it is, the destruction of urban areas is always a huge radicalizing factor of local populations. Al Anbar province was one of the most docile provinces of Iraq in the early days of the invasion. It wasn't until US soldiers killed a bunch of peaceful protestors and the Marines destroyed the entire city of Fallujah that it became an uncontrollable hotbed for extremism. And if it weren't for the fact that local tribes turned on AQI for their violence against locals, the US military would have never been able to regain control of the region. Had a more populace driven ideology filled the vacuum left by the withdrawal of the Baathists (for the sake of this post, let's say Anarchist guerrillas) the US would have likely been driven out entirely as the tribes would have never turned on the fighters. \n\n&gt;Most nations who can afford an expensive, strong centralised military, get a strong and centralised military. \n\nNo, most nations build a strong centralized military because at the time of the building of most nations, the biggest threat came from other nations. Around the world you can see how conventional militaries fair in battle against guerrillas. The EZLN completely drove out the Mexican military from the Chiapas region, Turkey is still unable to get any semblance of control on the PKK after decades of vicious fighting, the YPJ\/G drove Daesh from their land, the Filipino government is losing ground in the mountains to the NPA. Hell even if we wanted to take into account movements that are not at all friendly to leftism, the SA is just now beginning to win against the FSA, the Ukrainian military is still out matched by pro-Russian rebels, and Islamic extremist rebels are still raising hell all over Africa. \n\n&gt;And slowly but surely, technology is going to make that style of warfare completely irrelevant.\n\nI disagree. Decentralized militaries have been capable of beating centralized militaries for hundreds of years. Technology changes and strategy gets adapted. \n\n&gt;Hard to ambush a drone 20km up.\n\nEasy to kill the operator though. Easy to cut supply lines that keep drones in flight though.

I would say that if there was a vacant lot next to me that was fenced off, and the state happened to fall overnight, which meant no institution of police - and some neighbors after a few days were like hey we can use this to plant or build or any other thing, those neighbors would likely just go take the fences down and use the land. Right now, the police could be called, they could be fined or jailed, etc. which is what keeps you from taking down the fence, even tho the land sits there unused. It seems unlikely to me that another group of neighbors would see this happen and be offended that the private property, guarded by this fence, is being utilized. \n\nA quick anecdote, last year I saw this film at the First Nations film festival that talked about the history of the tribes around the settlement of Edmonton. the settlers at one point put up a garden but found that some of the tribes seemed to enjoy the vegetables and would routinely come by to take some. The settlers then constructed a fence which was then promptly taken apart by the tribes and the garden still raided. So the settlers had an armed guard stand over the garden so to not allow the tribe any more vegetables. The idea being that the indigenous people did not recognize this form of property, as such they saw the settlers come to their homelands and hunt the buffalo, cut down the trees, construct their homes etc, but they were not allowed these vegetables?","created_utc":1526320614,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Kropatrick","body":"Sure, historically anarchist regions have often been unable to beat off the combined forces of fascists and the liberals and socialists who either participate in their destruction or let it happen. Perhaps that is simply a result of tactics (I doubt it, personally) or perhaps that is a result of history.\n\nRegardless, I think its worth noting that even ostensibly socialist and revolutionary governments tend to do heinous shit, and without exception afaik have used their power to undermine other leftists. Germany's social democratic government of 1919 imprisoned, tortured, and killed other leftists. The Bolsheviks imprisoned and killed numerous anarchists, as well as violently putting down both the Kronstadt revolution and Makhno's Ukrainian revolution. Pretty much every socialist state that has survived into contemporary times has either become tyrannical and\/or made its peace with capitalism and learned to integrate it.\n\nThere are pros and cons to every kind of organizing. Organizing anarchistically often results in lower efficiency and troubles when it comes to defense. Building a strong military underneath a centralized power results in the abuse of that power and the deaths of other leftists.  \n\nYou seem to take issue with us not having a single rational plan for ensuring our survival, and there's a number of reasons for that, primarily that a preference for local autonomy kind of prohibits there being a single plan we all adhere to. More importantly, we tend to try and adapt our analyses as conditions evolve, and no leftist group in America or Europe is in a place to start developing concrete plans to break from or take over their respective governments. The shape that such a thing will take, and the relevant and possible tactics, can only be decided once the situation presents itself, and with our current numbers such a situation isn't possible. \n\nIt's also worth noting that a lot of anarchists, in their organizing, aren't strictly focused on building the infrastructure for \"the revolution\". The impetus to win converts (i.e. what most Marxist groups do), and thus potentially build the base for a large militia, is typically overshadowed by attempts to provide for the impoverished in a community, fight fascism, build co-ops and communes, unionize, offer prisoner support, etc. \"The Revolution\" is a bit far away to be on most folks minds right now (some of us, namely insurrectionaries and post-structuralist anarchists, even reject the model of there being a single, total revolution) as anything other than a motivating vision, and if you need a cohesive, final answer as to how it will play out then you will want to search out those answers elsewhere. \n\n","created_utc":1526379002,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"bilalqayum","body":"I've read your post as a good\\-faith discussion so please do the same for me \\(these discussion tend to either be people in complete agreement or screaming at each other unfortunately\\).\n\nIt may be better to use a distinction between tactics and legitimacy. If we tackle legitimacy first, we do have some external criteria to judge things by \\- popular support amongst the target population \\(i.e. did the French resistence have popular support amongst the population of France?\\). There is clearly widespread popular support amongst all segments of the Palestinian population, including Christian and non\\-religious \\(mostly Marxist\\) segments. Is the claim to sovereignty or resistance supported by most interpretations of international law? International Law may be a complex patchwork quilt of treaties, conventions and norms rather than a complete corpus of law but there is ample agreement that supports Palestinian self\\-governance and claims to at least parts of historical Palestine, the fact that even the US formally considers the West Bank and Gaza as occupied is testament to this.  \n\nWith regards to tactics, it is important to recognise that if we consider the cause of Palestinian self\\-determination to be legitimate, then armed resistance is part and parcel of this under \\(as far as I'm aware\\) every understanding of international law. Armed resistance is not particularly controversial and I don't believe it should be, I regard that to be primarily an internal discussion amongst the affected population, not a moral question. Outsiders can offer advice and support armed or peaceful resistance but that is not a universal moral question as far as I'm concerned. The question of morality that I consider it necessary to take an unyielding stance on is that of attacks against civilian populations, weapons of mass destruction, ecological damage, etc.\n\nSo the question here is one of morality and tactics. The biggest danger is considering the \"resistance\" as a monolithic whole, followed by the second biggest danger of ignoring any contextual background that informs our understanding of tactics. So I would urge anyone who considers the murder of civilians to be reprehensible \\(which, let's be frank, are the only people that I'm interested in engaging in discussions with\\) to consider these two points.\n\nThe Palestinians are not lacking in non\\-violent resistance movements and groups, these have deep roots in Palestinian civil society and have widespread support. From BDS \\(which has both roots and significant influence from Palestinian civil society\\) to the largely non\\-violent uprising of the first Intifada, it is a constant strand within the resistance struggle. This is something firmly evidenced within the academic literature on the recent history of Palestine. Generalising and admonishing the \"Palestinians\" for using immoral and indiscriminate violence would be both counter\\-productive \\(as it feeds into the remaining potent Israeli narrative which is being pushed relentlessly as global public opinions starts to shift dramatically\\) and also deeply painful, the current events stem from non\\-violent and civil resistance \\(which may involve violence against \"fences and walls\" but not at civilians\\). It is ironic that civil resistance that leads to deaths has resurfaced the tired old slogans about the Palestinians not producing a MLK \\- we are witnessing the very tactics that MLK employed himself, and even the tragic outcomes of marches such as Birmingham are echoed here.\n\nSecondly, and I've been typing this for ages so I'll have to stop boring you and actually be quick, Palestinian tactics do not exist in a vacuum. I'd always advise people that moral principles should not shift because of context, but your understanding of narratives and events must shift because of context \\- otherwise the results can be absurd. The level of Israeli public discourse, evidenced by both public support for executions and murder \\(see recent public trials for both\\) of Palestinians, poll results regarding public attitudes towards tactics employed by the IDF, the illegal and horrifying \"solutions\" to the conflict being discussed and debated by members of the government and public figures and the rampant ethic and religious\\-based hatred and slurs. These are comparable in scope and depth, if not necessarily intensity \\(although I would argue it is comparably intense, but I recognise that people might differ in their interpretation\\) of the rampant antisemitism and Jew hatred amongst the Palestinian population at large. \n\nGroups such as Breaking the Silence are invaluable in understanding this dynamic, hatred is not the preserve of Palestinians in this conflict, far from it. Don't shift your moral principles, cling to them, but understand that Israeli society cannot be divided into a militaristic violent military component and a liberal democractic internal component. Israeli society is just as sick and rotten from the conflict as Palestinian society is, in significantly different ways \\- being occupied infects the soul in different ways to how being the occupier infects the soul, but the infection is present nonetheless.\n\nSuicide bombings are moral reprehensible, as are the litany of war\\-crimes \\(aimed almost exclusively at civilians incidentally\\) that birthed the modern Israeli state \\(and I mean that literally, Deir Yassin is part of the  historical record that exists from 1948, not simply from the occupation in 1967\\). But legitimacy of resistance and differentials of power \\(both in application and in absorbing suffering\\) are what marks how I view the conflict, and why I reject half\\-hearted support of the Palestinians. I do not need to support Hamas attacks and nor do I need to disown them to a degree beyond how I would disown and urge against the use of immoral force by any population. I am not picking a football team, I am supporting both a moral principle and an oppressed population. And that population is both complex and utterly engaged in civil resistance, I find it morally urgent to resist the \"terrorist\"\/\"protection\" narrative that distorts these facts so brutally.\n\nI'll have to stop here otherwise I might end up with an incredibly long post that no\\-one wants to read \\(I've probably got there already\\) but I do think that context and clear moral thinking is incredibly important in sorting out how to think about the Israeli\\-Palestinian conflict.

But I'll leave that and address your P.S. \\(second paragraph\\) point.\n\nAs someone who identifies as an anarchist, I find the notion of only supporting other anarchists or groups challenging hierarchies quite dispiriting. One hallmark of Stalinist \"communism\" was precisely this way of looking at various conflicts and areas around the globe \\- instrumentalist and focused on identification and ideology. \n\nSupport those who are oppressed, even if they are conservative.

{"author":"bilalqayum","body":"This is an interesting area of debate but a lot more nuanced than Islam being rigid and strict. \n\nTheologically speaking, Sunni Islam is surprisingly flexible and has historically had a very ambivalent relationship with temporal authority. I would recommend the excellent book \"The Impossible State\" (can't recall the author but it will be easily searchable) as an entry point into classical Islamic theology that held that State (and pre-State) power was limited in authority and no theologian or jurist could issue rulings that overrode the rulings of another theologian or jurist, and that Sultans or Emirs were excluded from judicial or theological matters altogether. Classical Islamic civilisations simply couldn't operate traditional State legal systems as a result and the authority of the ruler was structurally limited despite constant attempts to expand then (which famously resulted in the founders of 3 of the 4 major theological schools of thought being imprisoned in their lifetimes by their rulers).\n\nIt is significant that the Ottomans had to fundamentally throw out the classical Islamic judicial system in the Tanzimat reforms in order to conform to the Nation State model of unchallenged central authority and power.\n\nHowever, I completely agree that modern \"Islamic\" political parties (like Hamas) essentially fix a single theological framework and graft it onto pure State power. A horrifying nightmare like Daesh or ISIS is the ultimate endpoint of this kind of fundamentalist outlook.\n\nRemember that theology is traditionally a language, a grammar, of how to discuss ethical and legal matters. Theology isn't necessarily rigid or strict. But a single theological view that is intolerant of dissent grafted onto a modern State machine is very much the stuff of nightmares.

{"author":"CosmicRaccoonCometh","body":"Thanks for taking the time to give me such a good response. \n\nI agree with a lot of what you are saying, and to the extent that Alston is arguing for the nationalism that your response critiques, I would disagree with them as well. \n\nBut I think what they are doing (or at least what I chose to take from it) is more observing the powerful role that culture and (for lack of a better term) even separatist sentiments play in the creation of communities of resistance. Communities of resistance (which can come in so many forms -- from affinity groups, to autonomous cells, to unions, etc) often congeal around cultural groups -- especially marginalized or oppressed cultural groups. Now, this doesn't necessarily mean they express that impetus for congealing as their reason for being. They may have been brought together as Catalans, or as Kurds, or as Mayans, or as African, etc, but some such groups then make their purpose socially revolutionary rather than just separatist or nationalistic. That is the \"beyond nationalism\" part. The \"not without it\" part, I think, is simply observing that culture or nationality can be an engine to fuel the creation of that building block of social revolution: the community of resistance. \n\nI'm definitely not defending nationalism as a solution or response to any sort of social issues, and I don't trust nationalists of any race or culture. But I don't believe Alston is advocating for that really. i think his goal is not to partner with nationalist movements, but rather to harness the sentiments that often express themselves as nationalist or separatist movements and to then go \"beyond\" nationalism -- much like the EZLN, Rojava, Catalan anarchists, the Black Army in Urkaine, Shinmin, and others have done in the past. All of these groups demonstrate how people faced with struggles that often lead to nationalism can take that impetus and transform it into a internationalist and revolutionary response. But most of these groups did not do so by rejecting their cultural struggle, but rather by building upon it and realizing all the struggles that were connected.

He's written numerous books and I believe these two started as essays.\n\nDebt is the one I've actually begun reading as you can see by the yellow bar beneath it, so I'll talk about that first. It's a history of debt and the ideas revolving around it. He starts it off by wondering how good people can accept horrible things when debt is involved. His example is his time in Madagascar when people were dying after the government cut anti malaria programs as part of austerity. He tells an activist at a party he wanted the debt to just be canceled and she responds by saying someone has to pay it.\n\nHe writes about debt as a moral concept quite a bit. Graeber also describes the real origins of money after dispelling the myth of barter economies that is common in mainstream economics. He provides details on numerous systems of precapitalist economies. \n\nIt's an interesting book and I don't know just much more it covers. \n\nBullshit jobs is a term Graeber has coined meaning jobs that don't really do anything. He had an email account for people to ask if their job was bullshit. Tons of people ended up responding. He says that if they think it's meaningless, it probably is. Who would know better, right? \n\nI imagine Bullshit Jobs will categorize the Bullshit Jobs, explain why they exist, and speculate on the effects that has on people.\n\nIf you have a Google Play Books account, the first two chapters are in the free sample.

{"author":"Zaratustash","body":"If you want more resources about non-state so called \"primitive\" societies (IMO its a mistake to label these societies \"precapitalist\" as they were pre-feudal first and foremost, and more importantly \"pre\" state) there is also Pierre Clastres' texts, particularly \"Society against the State\".\n\nPierre Clastres was an anthropologist who broke away from the more orthodox marxist influenced Levi-Strauss ethnographic schools. Also an anarchist, while still staunchly communist.\n\nHis work is fascinating, as they really offer a convincing narrative which largely complexifies the linear historical marxist understanding, while not rejecting it: it proposes that \"primitive\" non-state societies are not necessarily antecedent to subsequent \"necessary\" developments (like chiefdom &gt; slave society &gt; feudalism &gt; capitalism) but can also be understood as a politico-social branch off from the developments of state societies towards capitalism, showing that non-state societies display as much if not more complex dynamics of socio-political refinement in a course that is fully disassociated to the development of state societies, hence making the \"primitive\" qualifier used by Marx for example, all too simplistic, and quite eurocentric. Pretty sure Canadian indigenous political theorist Coulthard, in their book \"Red Skin White Masks\" addresses this, do check it out as well!\n\nIt's good shit. \n\nIMO I found Debt more useful to deconstruct the Liberal capitalist narratives about how markets and exchange were born (the typical barter &gt; primitive markets &gt; capitalism) which naturalizes commodity production, private property, and exchange for profit, in a totally a-historical way. His account of gift economies and the role of Debt just destroys Smith's and Locke's mythologies of the economy, and really fucks up capitalist ideological bullshit that tries to sell the idea that there is no alternative, and that we are reaching the end of a necessary linear history.

The \"Final Solution of the Jewish Question\" was the official code name for the murder of all Jews within reach, which was not limited to the European continent. This policy of deliberate and systematic genocide starting across German-occupied Europe was formulated in procedural and geo-political terms by Nazi leadership in January 1942 at the Wannsee Conference near Berlin, and culminated in the Holocaust which saw the killing of 90 percent of Jewish Poles, and two thirds of the Jewish population of Europe.\n\nThe nature and timing of the decisions that led to the Final Solution is an intensely studied and debated aspect of the Holocaust. The program evolved during the first 25 months of war leading to the attempt at \"murdering every last Jew in the German grasp.\" Most historians agree, wrote Christopher Browning, that the Final Solution cannot be attributed to a single decision made at one particular point in time.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1526467191,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Telkk","body":"Well thank you for the literature.  I've been reading some kropotkin.  Interesting stuff.  But I challenge you to read things that go beyond political and historical books because at the end of the day, all of that is just a synthesis of someone else's opinions on state and society.  And you know, it's funny because a lot of the literature that's been recommended to me was written in the 19th and 20th Century.  You know that's outdated information, right?  Like strong political theory aligns itself with what we think we know about reality and if you're deriving theories about race and society from people who grew up in a different era, then those theories are going to be flawed because things change all the time.  What we know about people as individuals, what we know about nature, what we know about race and it's lingering effects is drastically different from what we know today.\n\nI recommend reading science books on neurology and psychology before you dig into political theory because you'll come to see the many misconceptions communism, capitalism, socialism, and anarchism and all the isms make about society.  A really nice one is Steven Pinker's \"Blank Slate\".  It's a wonderful analysis of nature vs. Nurture and destroys a lot of the pre-conceived notions we have about race and culture. \n\nRacism isn't systemic.  It's organically maintained by people within a system that neither cares nor doesn't care about race.  It's what we do as individuals within the system that illuminates racial issues.  But we can go post racial if we really wanted to.\n\nLike, I'm mixed race and all of my friends are from all walks of life, including black people from the hood.  My friends are open and I've heard their stories and seen them first hand.  They've experienced racism as have I.  But that doesn't make it widespread, systemic, or life-threatening.  Oh and for that matter black culture and all cultures are radically changing so it's actually very disrespectful to lump races and cultures into singular categories because people are complicated and it isn't as simple as systemic racism, people being oppressed.\n\nJee if it were as black and white as you say it is, then we shouldn't have any problems fixing racial issues, right?  I mean, if it's systemic then let's just change some laws and pump a bunch of money and resources to the projects.  Yeah, we did that and we changed some laws and we still have lingering problems, though it's slowly getting better.  Those lingering problems, though?  That's the complicated part and I think to truly understand the problem you have to a.  Read faaaaar more than just simple political and historical literature and b.  Get out and actually live your life man.  Like, actually go make friends and live in the projects like I have for a while.  \n\nWhen you know what it means to be impoverished in an environment like that and when you know what it means to be mega rich and an environment that's the exact opposite of the projects, then you'll see that it's not so simple.  That's the truth man.  This whole movement is just based on academic literature and nothing more.

Those features aren't necessary components of pre-civilization, rather they are issues that helped erode the egalitarian social relations of pre-civilization. \n\nSo, the take away from radical anthropology and a study of how people lived prior to civilization, mass society, and hegemonic bureaucracies isn't to idealize them, but rather to see that authority isn't necessary, as well as to analyze the ways in which authority was able to overcome such people, and to learn from their mistakes.

But when creating new governments, revolution and eviction of the old is often the easy part. \n\nPlus, I worry that this will make international attention decline to Palestine and make people keep thinking that they are autonomous so they have to deal with their own problems due to national sovereignty, something I see very often when people try to argue in favour of national borders in the illegal immigration debate, even if it's a government that is keeping them down that they don't really have much power to remove. \n\nThere have been peace agreements before without splitting places up and even unifying places into polities. The Good Friday Agreement comes to mind. Often, forcing the current leaders to respect the will of the oppressed in their parliaments or other decisionmaking bodies as the case may be have been more successful, like the solution to American Apartheid was to give black people voting power. It would be suppressed by the drug war, felon disenfranchisement, and the lack of proportional representation, but even with those obstacles we have seen many improvements, though still a long way to go. If Palestinians had actual votes, and could kill the tenure of the Prime Minister or his policies on matters concerning Palestine, somewhat similar to the Irish petitions of concern, it would be rather hard to have the misnomer of a name, the IDF, firing on protesters. \n\nI also think that borders, being drawn arbitrarily and with people on both sides to be disconnected from each other, will be a huge problem for any independent Palestine. There is no larger union they could join, even if there were, it could be revoked at any time potentially. \n\nPlus, if the Israeli state were forced to let people flow across the borders as they will, without the option to search everyone, there is an incentive to not allow the education and media to be divisive, polarizing, and radical, and to have the quality of life that tends to make religion obsolete anyway. \n\nOf course, a state being a state, who knows what either option would really bring?\n\nI don't see how we advance the cause of anarchism and peace by having two states.

Large amounts of activism in the US against South African apartheid put pressure on the US government to withdraw support, this withdrawal was a significant factor in the end of apartheid. Anarchists were some of the first people to organize against apartheid, but would have never been able to put pressure on the US government if anti-apartheid activism had been confined to anarchist circles. Moderate allies helped a lot. They will be necessary to mobilize if we ever have a chance to pressure Western governments to stop supporting the occupation. If support is confined to anarchist circles then that will do 'fuck all'. We can, and we need to, ally with moderates on specific urgent issues.

Conversely the opposite is true as more things are commodified participation becomes more or less mandatory for survival\n- inevitably creates a currency\n- inevitably creates banks and debt\/credit \n- can\u2019t handle extranalities\n- are inherently irrational because they are made up of irrational choices\n\nBut don\u2019t let that stop you from exploring markets as an idea!

There's power and wealth to be had by being in control of a social order. And as long as people are revolting, a vacuum is created in the position of control. So, what happens in every revolution is some group comes along and tries to fill that vacuum. Now, the best way to fill that vacuum and to bring order to the revolting people is by tricking the people into ceasing revolting -- or at least enough of them to where you can use force to bring others to order. And the best way to trick them into ceasing to revolt and to support your new regime of order is by wrapping your new order in revolutionary rhetoric. \"In the name of the people\", \"for liberty\" \"justice\" etc. \n\nAnd, as you pointed out, they all do it.

Every single Bitcoin transaction is a smart contract. New opcodes have been very carefully enabled over the years to provide for greater functionality for Bitcoin smart contracts. Ethereum has run into problems, as you have observed, due to allowing for turing\\-complete scripting from the outset. And a hard\\-fork was required to correct critical flaws. But it is gradually growing into its own having gone through those lessons.\n\n&gt;computers alone can't replace the legal infrastructure around contract law.\n\nThis is not a forgone conclusion. Regardless, it does not have anything to do with paper. Once a smart contract is agreed to there is simply no effective disagreement, unless there are hooks in place for the action of a human agent. The enforceability of the contract at that point has nothing to do with the law except where there is provision for it. Only the actions of the parties involved are subject to law, but the behavior of the contract is constrained otherwise. If there is provision for action on a smart contract by a human agent then there is room for legal action as well. And some smart contracts are constructed with these hooks, for instance, in the case of decisions made by an escrow agent, where an arbitration must be adjudicated. You may want to look into the  functionality of these contracts with new eyes. Rather than frustrating a legal process they can be constructed to streamline enforcement and make the entire process more efficient. ","created_utc":1526729777,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

They would have been substantially more helpful by staying home and raising foreign currency \\- or best of all, running in supplies.\n\nIf I'd never read that, and all my info on say, the situation in Athens was coming from travelling riot tourists getting home and doing self\\-serving fanzines, I might come to the conclusion that going to Athens to brick a cop is a really great idea, whereas a little investigation actually confirms the opposite \u2014 like the brigadeers before them, clueless foreign riot tourists are widely considered a pain in the arse.\n\nThere's lessons you can get from everyday praxis, and lessons you can get from doing background reading.

In addition to political philosophy, Hobbes also contributed to a diverse array of other fields, including history, jurisprudence, geometry, the physics of gases, theology, ethics, and general philosophy.\n\nThough on rational grounds a champion of absolutism for the sovereign, Hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of European liberal thought: the right of the individual; the natural equality of all men; the artificial character of the political order (which led to the later distinction between civil society and the state); the view that all legitimate political power must be \"representative\" and based on the consent of the people; and a liberal interpretation of law that leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1526767109,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

These dudes are incredibly controversial, especially on the left, and especially right now, and these edits reflect that. \n\nTake, for instance, the edits about Robinson and Bartlett\/Beeley - there's a big backlash going on right now because the local tankie Assad cult tried to get an arab academic fired from his university for supporting \"terrorists\" (ie: the White Helmets) and it backfired big-time into very legitimate questions about their support for war crimes (that bit advocating the targeting of the White Helmets is a particularly popular point). That \"harassment and defamation\" regards a single line in an article which arguably kinda maybe mis-worded his still-really-gross comments on the relationship between Assange's rape charges and political correctness. As for Media Lens, it took about 30 seconds browsing their site (which currently seems entirely focused on denying Assad's gas attacks and attacking anyone who doesn't) to see exactly why someone might have replaced the first quote with the second. \n\nIs this guy biased?

A lot of people fetishize this idea of a revolution that breaks the state and continues on to break other states. But if people aren't able to unlearn capitalism, then they can't be freed from capitalism. Only you can break your chains, we can't break them for you. If it isn't a worker's revolution where each worker joins in solidarity, then I'd argue that you can't build an anarchist society from the ashes of a revolution.\n\nThe other argument might be that anarchism focuses a lot more on the negation of capitalism than on the construction of a post-capitalist world. There are schools of thought within anarchism that concern themselves with \"What next\" or theorize structures that can work against capitalism to build anarchism. But most of what anarchism does is negate hierarchies. It isn't a formula for a post-revolutionary society. Whenever I talk about \"the world after capitalism\" I try to talk about possibilities and trends, not in certainties.

{"author":"KnaveBB","body":"Anarchism doesn't posit that people are inherently good, but that most of us are inherently **sociable**. The % of outright serial killers is insanely, ridiculously small in comparison to people who are actually physically revolted by the notion of violence when faced with it. Violence is a learned behavior exacerbated by the very real and toxic stress we all face every day just trying to survive in this fucked up reality.\n\nExample: Historically, the vast majority of soldiers returning from wars where they had every right and duty\u2014according to their commanders\u2014to murder people, feel remorse, guilt, PTSD and shame at their actions. Most people, by a very real majority, are sociable. Why the fuck is facebook so popular, despite the fact that everyone knows it's terrible? Because we're sociable. Social connections are the most important thing to humans, and are what made us as successful as we are as a species, not competition.\n\nIn an anarchist society where all of your needs are met, you are not coerced or manipulated and you have access to everything you may need to address mental health problems, the % of people whose violent tendencies will be triggered by external stressors diminishes to virtually 0.\n\nIn the rare\u2014and they will be extremely rare\u2014case where someone acts out violently, and they knew it was bad, and they loved it and would do it again, and restorative justice won't work because they seek only violence, then yes an anarchy would allow us to use direct action to kill that person, if literally all they wanted to do was murder everyone. Duh.\n\nOur current society churns out murderers for so many reasons. The whole \"What do anarchists do with murderers?\" is the go-to ridiculous question that gets asked like it's the perfect \"gotcha!\" that will win every argument against anarchism. \n\nScientific research is freely available online that clearly points to a direct relationship between stress and aggression.

{"author":"glexarn","body":"Pacifism's main praxis as I understand it is to relentlessly wield the neutral center's humanity against your enemy by being a shining beacon of righteousness that your enemies cannot resist attacking. By attacking you, they show that you're right about them being monsters, and their actions push support away from the enemy and towards towards your cause. Eventually, they earn themselves such revulsion from the wider community that they cannot continue their present course and must allow some of the changes that you desire. Or that's how it's supposed to go, anyway.\n\nIt doesn't work if the enemy is simply willing to grind you into dust wholesale and damn the consequences. There was no way for a pacifist Jew or Roma or LGBT or disabled person to exercise pacifist praxis against the Nazis, for example. But it can and has worked in less extreme cases where the enemy is not actively genocidal and does care to some degree about the consequences of visibly suppressing your continued peaceful resistance.\n\nAlso, it helps if there's a fellow traveler that's willing to exercise violence on behalf of your cause, because then the dilemma becomes \"it's our way or my friend's way, and you really don't want my friend's way\".

It's been discovered that certain leafy plants exude defensive chemicals when they are specifically being eaten, suggesting they may be able to suffer what we would interpret as pain, or experience what we would call fear. Look up research by Dr. Heidi Appel.\n\nAll of this begs the question: we need to eat, we cannot survive on sunlight, so how do we subsist morally? Part of my moral subsistence is recognizing that animals have cognition rivaling our own, emotionally, even the ones we may not be able to recognize because we are just too different (fish, insects etc.) The ecosystem is fundamentally built on interrelationships between species across the globe, and our farming practices are disrupting that dangerously. I think eating lower on the food chain, from producers within my community is at least my first step in reducing the impact I make on the environment, and doing what I can to not infringe on the happiness of cognitive creatures.\n\nA truly anarchist society would definitely need to deal with these important points and seriously.

{"author":"vintagedan","body":"First of all, violence is frowned upon if used as a tool of oppression. Also, it's very ineffective. \n\nCase in point: the state uses violence to force us into abiding by its rule when we deviate, into accepting even the most absurd demands. Yet, when all is said and done, the state isn't able to ingrain conformity by bashing our heads. Even the most oppressive regime cannot stop dissent through violence - people outsmart it in a myriad of subversive ways and keep their ideas alive.\n\nSure, the system is alive and kicking, but that's because people in support of it are the majority. These people get outraged at the idea of ending private property, for instance. How are we supposed to enforce this kind of change without enough people on our side? Let's face it, none of this support happens because people are threatened by sheer violence. It happens because people are brainwashed from the get-go into thinking all this is very correct and moral.\n\nSo how does that relate to us? Well... Say there's a revolution today and we succeed in abolishing the state. Now what? How do we make it so that no one tries to make a factory their property? They're not gonna just simply change their mind. And they're gonna fight. Such a thing leads us into a constant cycle of violence, one in which everything devolves into sheer savagery. \n\nIf we're not to become the next state, we need people to embrace our ideals. We need to reach critical mass to see any kind of change. And whenever that happens, we won't need violence.\n\n&gt;What do you do when violence is brought to you?\n\nFight back, I guess. Few people will frown upon the idea of using violence to neutralise an immediate threat to your safety, to get yourself out of harm's way.

{"author":"eliaspowers","body":"From an earlier thread, here's my take on gender and its relation to anarchism:\n\n&gt;There are four ways of understanding gender, all of which tend to get conflated in mainstream discourse. One is gender as a relation to a sexed body. This is often what trans people have in mind when they assert that their body does not match their gender--to be a \"man\" is to feel at home with a certain set of reproductive organs that, as it turns out, not all men happen to be born with.\n\n&gt;The second is to understand gender as a set of norms. So, to be a \"man\" or a \"woman\" is to occupy a social position that entails certain rights and responsibilities. A man is supposed to go to war for his country and be a quiet brave protector. While a \"woman\" is supposed to be submissive and elegant and tend to men's needs and desires.\n\n&gt;Third, there is gender as a social class. Here the idea is that to be a \"woman\" is to be treated in a particular way by society; more specifically, to be subordinated on the basis of perceived sexual role. So, for example, from birth one group of people is dressed in pink, given toys that mimic items used for domestic chores, and praised primarily for their appearance. Unsurprisingly, this group of people as adults tend to be systematically excluded from positions of political power and economic independence.\n\n&gt;Finally, there is gender as performance. This is somewhat adjacent to gender as a set of norms, but the idea here is that your gender is what you do, rather than what you are. To be a \"woman\" is just to make a number of choices regarding hairstyle, dress, etc. that instantiate femininity. This notion of gender is also adjacent to the first in that feeling at home in a particular sexed body also tends to be linked with feeling at home in a performance of a certain gender in this fourth sense.\n\n&gt;The anarchist position on gender of the first form is that people should be free to realize the sexed body in which they feel at home and treated as others are who have the same sexed body. This reflects the basic anarchist commitment to individual freedom, self-ownership, and self-realization.\n\n&gt;Anarchists think gender in the second and third forms must be smashed, the second because it amounts to a form of social control that undermines autonomy (your actions should not be bound by the arbitrary form your body happens to take!), and the third because it is a form of inegalitarian, hierarchical domination. No one should live a worse life materially or be otherwise subordinated because of how others perceive their reproductive role.\n\n&gt;Finally, anarchists typically embrace free gender expression in the fourth form, as it is, again, a way of expressing personal freedom and autonomy.\n\n&gt;However, there are times when these commitments might come into tension. For example, TERFs tend to think that preserving gender in either the first or fourth form comes into conflict with eliminating gender in the third sense. By contrast, trans-friendly anarcha-feminists think that the TERF emphasis on women being strictly a social class marginalizes trans people by excluding them from the class of women (since trans women were not socialized as women). Alternatively, one might wonder if you can get rid of gender as an apparatus of social control while still taking a laissez-faire, \"let people perform whatever gender they want\" attitude. So things can definitely get messy, and there are lots of debates over gender that haven't been resolved yet.","created_utc":1526941171,"score":20,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

When they say \u201cban the guns\u201d they\u2019re advocating the most radical, out there option that they think they\u2019re allowed to advocate. They think that because it riles up the Republicans just like pro-choice policies and ending the drug war does, that it must be a good thing. I know this because I used to be one of those Democrats, concerned *entirely* with fighting the political opposition instead of the economic one. \n\nSo, step 1 is face time. This never works online where all the rules for rational debate get flung right out the window. Find a Democrat meet and greet and get yourself in. \n\nStep 2 is to get them to confirm that mass shootings are a symptom of a broken world rather than the cause of it. This shouldn\u2019t be too hard, but may take some fancy footwork. Leading questions help. \u201cWould you disagree that shooters become who they are as people because of a broken and unfair society?\u201d\n\nStep 4 would be to confirm that taking away all the guns (I\u2019d go to so far as to engage on a hypothetical wherein *literally* all guns can be found and confiscated) would not stop incidents of gross violence. With this confirmation you can start sliding the theme of the debate away from gun control and into more revolutionary waters. \n\nStep 5 for me would be an optional summation. I find this keeps me on track. \u201cSo you agree that people are committing mass shootings because of a horrific society, and you also agree that taking away the guns won\u2019t stop murderous people from being murderous? Alright, good. We\u2019re on the same page.\u201d\n\nStep 6  is to introduce your ideas of a healthy society before they can interject theirs.

In fact, it is probably better to be violent against Nazis than to do nothing.\n\nFor pacifists, they put their body on the line to try to protect people and to change minds. Hate is a powerful emotion, but it is also unsustainable.

Concessions and temporary victories may be possible through pacifism and DemSoc electoralism, but fundamental change is not.\n\nB. You have talked about the limits of pacifism as far as self defense goes - that you and others have a right to defend themselves. I agree. I simply extend self defense into the realm of oppression. I and all others have the right to defend themselves from oppression, from slavery, from racism, sexism, transphobia, and any other kind of ideology or action that threatens them.

It's all a bunch of bullshit but I don't think they can rightfully be called a tax drain or anything of the sort. The crown estate was the result of royals willingly giving the government rights to land that otherwise belonged to them, which in turn benefits the taxpayers because something like 85% of money from the crown estate goes to the treasury. Keep in mind that if this property had not been added to the crown estate that money would be reduced to just the taxes they would pay on it which would be a lot less.\n\nTLDR land would probably belong to the royal family and not the govt if the monarchy was abolished, would be a net loss financially but (depending on your views) a moral and ideological gain.\n","created_utc":1527009906,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"prole-osophy","body":"&gt;so i had to make my own inferences\n\nI wouldn't suggest that because I think I have have thought about the issue and I think that my views are thought out, even if they aren't correct.\n\n&gt;as far as i'm aware there hasn't been an anarchist revolution in a country with a constitutional monarchy\n\nSo, another thing. Don't move the bar. If we are in pure thought experiment that's fine, but my claim was about monarchies in the historical classical sense versus your modern sense where reforms have already been clawed away from them in blood and slaughter. In general, I think we should stick less toward thought experiment and more about observed incidents of where monarchical systems were actually dismantled. This goes back to my own generally favorable opinion of the French revolution: it was basically critical that the monarchy be destroyed, root and branch, in order for ideas like \"constitutional monarchy\" to even exist properly in a slightly tamed manner -- more egregious forms of monarchy can still be found in the gulf. \n\nBuilding on that, your moral claims, I think, are built on extracted concessions and this semi-benign version is merely the result is harsh action already taken. I suspect if the 'reforms' hadn't gone through you would be singing a different tune about the matter, but I can't be sure. \n\n&gt;how about actually justifying executing people for being born into the wrong family without giving them the choice to give up their status and join the proletariat, rather than just throwing your hands up and basically saying \"well you can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs\" when we're talking about actual human beings' lives?\n\nOn its face this has some merit, however, when we look at children in a \"wide\" and \"narrow\" sense another series of issues come up. \n\nIn the wide sense of \"children\", I meant the issue of heredity means that establish relations of power move through bloodlines. This is 'wide', as anyone with a certain degree of relation is considered threatening to our new status quo. As such, \"children\" typically means people related in a generally immediate sense to the established system of power. This can include anyone with legitimated blood. Adults, for example, might be classed under the same rubric. The issue of 'children' for me is not a simple cut and dry moral offense: So long as power is understood as blood and one's blood relation, I have a dim view of letting those people strut around as a persistent symbolic and literal threat to any form of revolution.\n\nMoving on. Let's look in the the narrow sense of \"children\", where you mean children and babies. There is an obvious moral offense to killing them, and you propose that they simply be forced to renounce their status and be afforded certain peaceable arrangements with the new status quo. It sounds good, but I think if we look at it we confront another moral and ethical dilemma.\n\nYour proposition is that we can offer these children -- in a narrow sense -- choices, but we are already imposing on them already. Indeed, are already imposing an almost unspeakable horror on them. 'We' such as 'we' are, are likely killing their family (either accidentally or in a deliberate way depending on circumstances), seizing them by force, and making decisions for them. We are strangers, and we are hostile strangers. Moreover, we are taking their land and property, generally in a way that they would consider illegal or a crime, and imposing a degree of cruelty up until the act of actually killing them. (I am sometimes given thinking about this as being similar to the Cuban right-wing refugees: they have never abandoned their grudge, and never will. They persistently and consistently hate and work to hurt the government in Cuba -- and these people *aren't even leaders*.) Now, that in mind, we can imagine the kind of grudge, the kind of mentality, that such a person might have if they were the literal ruler of the county before they were forced to flee to Canada or something. Is that something we should allow? To what degree?\n\nAlright, let's go back to judgement. In effect, you proposed we allow a voluntary renegotiation of status so that we don't need to engage in an unpleasant activity. This seems reasonable at a glance, but I think there's a niggling issue insofar as a voluntary judgement for a child is hardly a judgement. Indeed, \"voluntary\" judgements are not things that are put upon children: they are children, and subject to the whims of the people around them. At best you would get a situation like Pu-Yi, where an individual is forcibly detained, his status stripped, and he is detained\/re-educated to be in a status less offensive to the new status quo. However, this too required the death of many children in the narrow sense as the entire prior system was torn apart in what can only be described as cruelty. I think we should be honest with ourselves be understand that when we call for a revolution, it is not a thing that is simply going to be done without broken eggs. Should we deliberately break some eggs, however? That's less clear to me.\n\nSo, I suppose, in summary:\n\n* (A) We can compel children by force to adopt the new status quo as children and thus falling into the moral status as 'babynapping brainwashers who killed or imprisoned [not very Anarchist] my family'. This seems to be almost (although not quite) as morally offensive as simply knocking them off, especially when the truth comes out and they start to ask questions. *Nevermind if they hold a grudge.*\n* (B) If they are adults, or nearly adults, they stand to menace everything by virtue of the status of the monarchy as a hereditary blood relation, as a fact. Their existence is a crime, as it has been said by another.\n\n---\nTL;DR: My general inclination is that these sorts of people, especially given their status and milieu, are more likely to grudge than to simply abandoned their landed rights and advantages. Simply forcing them to repent isn't quite enough, especially when the chance of flight of nursed grievance is real. We are being cruel, that much is certain.","created_utc":1527023986,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Psychopathic_Owls","body":"The central component to the question of veganism is whether or not to ascribe rights to animals, presuming here that rights are constructs of a given society and not god given or inalienable. \n\nOur first avenue is to acknowledge that animals do in fact have consciousness and qualify for personhood, thus an ethical society and individual must ascribe them rights and respect them in similar ways as we respect human life (or at least should).\n\nSecond, we acknowledge that animals have consciousness but do not accept that this necessarily grants them personhood, thus not requiring us to ascribe them rights.\n\nThe matter of personhood is hotly debated but few modern commentators will argue against animal consciousness. However, there is a middle path. If you accept that animals can suffer (which you would be hard pressed to deny) and you accept that killing and eating them causes them to suffer and you agree that needless or avoidable suffering is wrong, then you must accept that it is wrong to consume animals. Extend this argument to animal labor, testing, and products as you will.\n\nSadly, even being aware of this may not be enough to sway people away from their traditions and habits. I personally look forward to the day of mass produced lab grown meat which will render the question moot. \n\nThere are also larger questions. Are we obliged to maintain the health and conditions of existing livestock if we are no longer going to use them (let alone should we)? Modern chickens and cows for example will perish in the wild.

It kind of sounds like your banning was a perfect example of the anarchist principle of free association. \n\nIn an anarchist context you've got every right to say and do whatever you want. That's freedom and it's awesome, #fuckyeahanarchy\n\nIn an anarchist context, if you're being a shit and a group of fellow anarchists don't like you, they have every right to their freedom from your shit, which is equally awesome, #fuckyeahfreeassociation\n\nSo find a group of anarchists who like your joke and freely associate with them. Or, if you're having a hard time finding such a group, my guess is your joke was a punch down at a disenfranchised, marginalized group for whom anarchists are fighting, or something equally shitty. Banning you wasn't a use of power or hierarchy or anything like that, it was a group's way of exercising free association.\n\nIn an anarchist society, there are still consequences for our actions. They don't come from a hierarchical, power-based system of oppression and laws, they come from our social relationships. I'm aware this sounds like the tyranny of crowds. Free association solves that problem. Yes, anarchism is a leftist movement, it always has been.

{"author":"aronbarco","body":"Broadly speaking, left-wing and right-wing are views regarding property (either communal or privatised) and what generates value, as focused through the lenses of the product of human labour. This division is, pretty much, a Marxist paradigm, with (as usual) its Hegelian undertones, and it works on top of a problematic distinction of humanity and nature. This way of seeing politics is blatantly blind to other lifeforms and how we interact with them. Under such paradigm, what a beaver constructs will always have no intrinsic value, whereas anything a human architect projects always has value.\n\nNothing I said is \"sowing doubt on existing knowledge\". I'm not sowing doubts on any knowledge claim; there is nothing to be tested or \"proven\" here, this is not a science, it has no criteria of evidence, much less standards of proof. This line is just a way of organising the logical space of political views. Rather, I'm claiming there are other political views that do not fit squarely on this dichotomy. It can be done otherwise. For instance, we could expand our view of possible political views by making it, at the very least, two-dimensional, encompassing not only what humans consider useful, but maybe also biodiversity in that scale. A two-dimensional distinction would do a better job in pointing out the difference between Lenin and Bakunin, and better yet, it also encompasses views such as Timothy Morton's.\n\nI'm definitely not advocating that we should forget the class war (not because it is a great concept, but because the rich do fight it and do whatever they can to consume every thing on their path). If you are reading this out of what I wrote, you are misunderstanding me. There is nothing reactionary in what I'm saying -- actually, I'm being way more revolutionary than you give me credit for: I'm trying to look for a thought that better responds to our current ecological crisis, instead of looking back to a 200-years old way of thinking.

{"author":"gatorgrowl44","body":"&gt;The central component to the question of veganism is whether or not to ascribe rights to animals, presuming here that rights are constructs of a given society and not god given or inalienable.\n\nWell, just one right really, the basic right to not be needlessly abused\/exploited\/harmed\/used as property.  We're not out here advocating for chicken's right to vote or cow's right to drive cars or anything.\n\n&gt;Our first avenue is to acknowledge that animals do in fact have consciousness and qualify for personhood, thus an ethical society and individual must ascribe them rights and respect them in similar ways as we respect human life (or at least should).\n\nAgreed.\n\n&gt;Second, we acknowledge that animals have consciousness but do not accept that this necessarily grants them personhood, thus not requiring us to ascribe them rights.\n\nWhat definition of personhood do you go by?  I don't think it's necessary to grant them personhood to grant them to aforementioned basic right to not be needlessly abused\/exploited\/commodified\/etc. but it is a possibility in some cases.\n\n&gt;The matter of personhood is hotly debated but few modern commentators will argue against animal consciousness. \n\nAnyone who argues against animal consciousness I would challenge to go attempt to catch the animals you usually eat with your bare hands and eat them.  Any doubters will soon find that they are indeed conscious, sentient beings with interest in self-preservation.\n\n&gt;If you accept that animals can suffer (which you would be hard pressed to deny)\n\nAh, I see we agree.\n\n&gt;and you accept that killing and eating them causes them to suffer and you agree that needless or avoidable suffering is wrong, then you must accept that it is wrong to consume animals. Extend this argument to animal labor, testing, and products as you will.\n\nCouldn't have said it much better myself.\n\n&gt;Sadly, even being aware of this may not be enough to sway people away from their traditions and habits.\n\nNot sure if pessimistic or realistic but I choose to remain optimistic in people's ability to change once their perceptions do.\n\n&gt;I personally look forward to the day of mass produced lab grown meat which will render the question moot.\n\nYeah, so do I but the unavailability of mass produced lab grown meat is not a valid justification to persist in an immoral practice that already has a viable alternative.\n\n&gt;Are we obliged to maintain the health and conditions of existing livestock if we are no longer going to use them (let alone should we)? Modern chickens and cows for example will perish in the wild. Should we perform a mass culling or sterilization or let them perish naturally? \n\nEh, the world isn't going to go Vegan overnight - as demand for these animals slowly and steadily drops, as will the supply, until there (eventually, much further down the road) are only a relatively small population of them.  At which point I think it would be best to care for those that we can care for in Animal Sanctuary type locations.  But unfortunately (for them but not for the Earth), yes, most of them will not exist, at least not in the same unfathomable quantities they exist today.\n\n&gt;Have we committed an egregious crime in genetically modifying these species with artificial selection and the like? \n\nI'd argue we have.  But I'm curious what your opinion on that is.\n\n&gt;What of individuals with medical needs or religious\/traditional obligations?\n\nMedical needs are one thing and should probably be looked at on a case by case basis, as Vegans aren't necessarily pacifists and, for example, would have no problem helping someone fight off a bear attack.  The definition of Veganism actually accounts for outlier cases like this with the language, \"as far as possible\/practicable\"\n\nHowever, religion\/culture\/tradition\/etc. *per se* are simply not valid justifications to persist in a needlessly harmful act.\n\nedit: a word","created_utc":1527116496,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Three officers begin grabbing him.\n\n8:20 Five officers begin wrestling with Brown. \"GET ON THE GROUND\"\n\n8:25 \"Anyone got a taser?\"\n\n8:35 Sterling is now on the ground with three (?) officers on top of him. One officer yells \"TASER TASER TASER\"\n\n8:40 A pop we can assume is the taser shot. Sterling moans in pain.\n\n10:30 they go through Sterling's car.\n\n12:00 they finish. Cop with camera is reading something?\n\n16:59 - Original officer talking to another cop: \"He's like, 'I'm a Bucks payer bla bla bla.' So what?\"\n\n19:20 - audio ends while they are talking after the original officer appears to be fidgeting with the camera. Audio returns about 30 seconds later\n\n23:00 - Sterling is back with visible bruises.\n\n23:50 - Sterling: \"What are we waiting on?\" - Original officer: \"We got all night long\"\n\n24:20 - Sterling: \"You initiated everything.\" - Original officer: \"No you initiated everything.\"\n\n24:50 - Original officer \"Bucks player? Sorry, I don't follow the Bucks. I didn't recognize you. Sorry I didn't recognize your famous name.\" (sarcastically)\n\n26:00 - Sterling - \"You walked up on me.\" Original Officer: \"Don't make that up. It's all on camera (paraphrased).\" Sterling: \"You're just gonna say that in front of everybody.\" (the beginning of the video clearly shows the officer approaching Sterling as he walked towards his door)\n\n27ish - Sterling tells him to look him up and the officer responds with; What have you done? I don't know where to look you up. You been to Mars? You been to the moon? Where are you known at? Illinois? (Illinois supposed to be a crack about Chicago?)","created_utc":1527119144,"score":9,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

If somebody shares something personal and you don\u2019t understand, it\u2019s up to you to gain that knowledge. You don\u2019t just immediately question their identity because you are ignorant. Asking the question at the place they did is either a sign of bad faith or just being lazy and ignorant (see number 2). \n\nAs to number three, you seem to imply that while assholes don\u2019t deserve an explanation, if a nice person is asking an honest question then they deserve an answer. That\u2019s not true. It\u2019s not up to the people in the thread to do their intellectual work, and it\u2019s presumptuous to assume that they will do that for you.\n\nThat brings us to number four. Regardless of whether the person read the sidebar, they chose to jump into the conversation with no understanding of the discussion at hand, no tact with regards to basic human interaction, and an expectation to be educated without putting forth any intellectual work themselves. If it was a 101 subreddit they might have at least gotten a decent explanation, but it\u2019s a circlejerk. It\u2019s meant as a place for people well acquainted with a subject and is full of in jokes and shared context. So in addition to being ignorant of the specific issue at hand they were also ignorant of the general purpose and population of the sub. \n\nAll of that assumes they were asking an honest question, but now on top of that is the alternative that they are a troll.

Unless you're allergic to anything that isn't meat, you're physically capable of going vegan.\n\nYou know what, I'm going to bite on this. I pulled up a list of the top ten protein choices for a vegan diet. Of those, I can't eat beans, seitan, or anything with gluten unless I want to deal with pain and bleeding from the ass. (Sorry if that's disturbing, but I think we need to get real for this.) That leaves some options:\n\n- Tofu, which I eat three times a week or so, and tempeh which I love but can't get unless I make it myself. However, I know from experience that five meals a week (three main meals plus two lunches from leftovers) is my limit. TVP is right out; it's worse than legumes.\n\n- Quinoa, which I don't really care for but can eat. The only problem is that one cup has 16% of the daily protein requirement but around 39% of the number of carbs I can safely eat in a day without having my blood glucose level spike. (I'm diabetic\u2026 and cue the evangelists who will offer unsourced anecdata about how being vegan will cure that.)\n\n- Buckwheat - great stuff, but again only 11% of the RDA of protein and 30% of the carbs.\n\n- Quorn - It's expensive, but I use it every other week or so. I think most of it is bound with egg whites, but the grounds may not be.\n\n- Spirulina - I didn't know about this one and will have to check it out. It sounds like it's mainly a supplement.\n\nYes, \"tons\" of fruits and vegetables have protein. Even lettuce has 1 gram of protein in a serving. However, how much of it can (or are you willing to) eat? \n\nI'm not non-vegan because I'm ignorant of nutrition or because I'm insensitive to all of the issues around production of food animals. I continue to experiment with what I can and can't eat, and I do want to end up as a lacto-vegetarian, which is probably the ideal place for me. However, I also know my body through a lot of doctors and a lot of painful experience, and your statement is simply false. \n\ntl;dr Employ your vegansplaining elsewhere.","created_utc":1527122390,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

To re-purpose my comment from when this came up on \/r\/anarchy101 recently, I think this is one of the topics that is strangely the least explored within anarchist literature, yet it is an important aspect of the history of actual anarchistic social revolution. I think the best thing I've read on the topic from the anarchist perspective is [Beyond Nationalism But Not Without It](https:\/\/libcom.org\/library\/beyond-nationalism-not-without-it) by former Black Panther, Ashanti Alston. \n\nThe history of the large anarchist social revolts has actually been quite intertwined with separatist or nationalist movements. From the Ukrainians with Makno, the Mayans with the EZLN, the Kurds in Rojava, the Koreans in Shinmin, as well as more anarchistic currents in social revolutionary movements in others places. \n\nI think the reason for the overlap is that cultural bonds, especially when that culture is targeted and marginalized, tends to help foster communities of resistance that have animosity to the status quo, and who have come to see first hand the negative results of a nationalist and hegemonic state. From there, if those communities come to see how simply a nationalist struggle will not best serve them in their struggles (because being ruled by a rich person of your culture isn't going to change much, and\/or because it would mean alienating certain potential allies not of your culture, but who are otherwise sharing your struggles), the result is that they can do what Alston referred to as \"going beyond\" nationalism -- but the basis for their revolutionary movement would still be the communities of resistance based on that national\/cultural identity (i.e. \"not without it\"). \n\nSo, basically, I would say that the hard work of creating communities of resistance (which is the bedrock of social revolution) has historically been greatly helped by cultural bonds, especially those under duress. And I think the examples I mentioned above show that defending one's culture need not be expressed as simple nationalism, but can indeed be expressed in an internationalistic socially revolutionary way.

I honestly do not have a judgement on this in particular as I do not subscribe to primitivism nor do I think nature has some sacred right to be totally unaffected by humans.

However, I do think there are many distinct cultural and religious practices involving animal slaughter that must at least be considered. Inuit whale hunting comes to mind. It holds a distinctly significant and spiritual role in traditional Inuit society. Can we ban their religious practice, (I'm speaking here as a white American) or must we simply ask them to decide for themselves? Pieces of animals also play a roll in many voodoo and hoodoo practices. Modern practitioners generally source their materials ethically, but there are certain rituals and holidays that still call for blood and sacrifice.

But even with this in mind, I fully believe that the members of these cultures can be swayed by veganism as easily as any other.\n\nMy question to you would be; Imagine someone who has studied veganism and agrees with its core tenants and acknowledges the moral rightness of the practice and the moral wrongness of consuming animals but remains unmoved to change their behavior and become vegan in practice.

Small groups of people can be overlooked, but larger groups are a 'market' to be 'optimised' or 'exploited'. For this reason external political forces tend to get involved pretty fast.

Try to make some small changes to your lifestyle. Learn how to pirate stuff online (hypothetically), get into riding a bike, get some tongs and a bag and pick up trash around your neighbourhood (I do this while walking my dog), learn how to garden, fix pipes and electricity. Maybe even do some dumpster diving.\n\n2. Do some community building, meet your neighbours, set up a small book or tool box, join Food Not Bombs, teach your friends how to pirate, work on an open-source project if you\u2019re alright with computers, get people thinking about cooperatives.\n\n3. Maybe make some alternative media like memes or a YouTube channel.\n\n4. Do direct actions, anything from fixing potholes without permission to blocking ICE vehicles (if you\u2019re American) to joining the sea Shepard\u2019s. There\u2019s lots of options.\n\n5. Start organising your housing, workplace and community. Libcom has a pretty good guide on this and community organising is done well for the CIPO-RFM and Shardoyava Shramandana Movement.\n\n5. Start setting up small alternatives. Community gardens, cooperatives (worker, housing, finance), intentional communities, squats, Democratic schools and so on.\n\n6. Start seizing space like the Mohawk did in the Oka Crisis or the Gezi Park demonstrations. These are temporary autonomous zones.\n\n7. Start permanently seizing space like the Zapatistas, Cher\u00e1n, FEJUVE and Barbacha have. These are anarchist societies and we should model of them.\n\nI\u2019m on mobile right now and couldn\u2019t go into as much detail as I like, but a sort of \u2018anarchist tactics\u2019 guidebook would be very cool.","created_utc":1527264191,"score":8,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}
{"author":"Madoka-Kaname","body":"What helps me to not hate people I consider horrible is to keep in mind that no one gets to choose who they are. You don't get to choose your genetic code or upbringing. Even if souls exist you don't get to choose what kind you get (and if souls are a blank slate they don't need to be considered).\n\nSometimes people will say things like \"free will is how you play the cards you were dealt,\" but no one chooses their skill at \"playing the cards\" either. Your intelligence, your work ethic, your interests, your worldview, these must be determined by nature and\/or nurture because there isn't anything else, at least as far as I can see.\n\nIn other words, the only difference between me and being the most vicious capitalist out there is dumb luck. So I look on people like that with pity rather than hatred, even if I find myself frequently angered by their actions.\n\nTo clarify on the free will stuff, I make decisions all the time and some of those decisions are very important to me. This isn't a contradiction because considering something important is entirely subjective--it's important to me as soon as I decide it is. Ultimately, free will doesn't make life any more or less meaningful because meaning is subjective.\n\nGetting more to the point, hatred arises naturally in a hierarchical society because it is a way to feel powerful, and hierarchical society damages all of us psychologically by strongly associating power (which is destructive to ourselves and our civilization) with safety in our minds from the time we are children. It's worth considering that both your hatred and the capitalist's avarice come from the same source, the need to feel powerful that this vicious society inflicts on all of us.\n\nThe unexpected extra tragedy of all this is that even the most powerful people aren't usually happy, because their entire sense of self-worth is based on having power and they live in fear of the countless competitors becoming more powerful than them. Does Donald Trump seem remotely happy to you? He doesn't to me, he seems to do almost nothing but fearfully protect his fragile ego through belittling others and trying to make himself look good.\n\nI can't tell you if you are strong enough to let go of hatred, and since free will isn't a thing you don't even get to choose if you are strong enough. But you can't know if you are strong enough until you either succeed or completely give up on trying, so it's worth your best effort in my opinion. Because if you let yourself be psychologically addicted to hatred and somehow capitalism and the state are abolished, there is going to be nobody to turn that hatred on but your comrades.","created_utc":1527264275,"score":6,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"HeloRising","body":"It helps to actually look at the numbers.\n\nIf you control for suicide, the number of people in the US who lose their lives to guns (including accidents) is less than 10,000 every year. For comparison, car accidents kill 40,000 people every year.\n\nViolence and loss of life is always tragic but we have to realize that we live in a media environment that plays up things like shootings and that creates the effect of people feeling like these things happen more often than they actually do. Actual overall violent crime has gone down over the last five or so decades but the perception of how much violent crime there actually is has risen dramatically; there's less real violence but people *believe* there is far more.\n\nThe practical solutions have [almost nothing to do with guns themselves.](https:\/\/www.bpncchicago.org\/single-post\/2018\/03\/15\/CPS-Student-Demands-EducationNotCriminalization)\n\nViolence is almost always a socially based problem and thus approaching it with a material based one, namely bans, is not going to help. You need to address the underlying cause of the problem before you start to help it.\n\nThis is part of why I get so frustrated and angry with gun control proponents. If you're pushing gun control then you are actively contributing to the problem because you're trying to push a quick-fix solution that doesn't actually help, diverting resources away from ideas that actually reduce violence.\n\nThe majority of the large scale studies and meta analysis done suggest either now or low impact of things like bans and restrictions. There's no consistent picture of the effectiveness of restrictions across states, more rules do not equate to lower levels of violence. This suggests strongly that there are more factors at play than just the presence of firearms.\n\nThe problem with gun control from a leftist and a radical leftist stance is that the justifications for owning a firearm seem theoretical and academic *until they aren't.* You don't need a firearm until someone's throwing bricks through your window, burning crosses on your lawn, or sending out police to round up \"troublemakers.\"\n\nThis may be an extreme example but I think it bears on the discussion. I attended a lecture a while back of a guy who was a teenager in the 1930's as a Jew in Germany. A lot of people never really believed that the Nazis would do what they ultimately did. He said some people were denying it even as they were being herded into trucks. A lot of people still clung to the idea that they were just going to be relocated. He talked about people who mentioned the idea of getting guns or even just running away but they were shut down because people just didn't think it would be necessary, they didn't believe that the Nazis would actually hurt them.\n\nAnd I realize that's possibly the most extreme example there is but it bears consideration. We are an extremely results-oriented thinking culture; if we can't see it, it isn't happening. Consequently we tend to want to discard things that help us because we can't see the benefit they give or we've come to accept the benefit\/protection as just a given and now we don't understand why that thing is there now.\n\nLook at the anti-vaxxers. It's possibly the most irrational position a person can hold and flies in the face of literally mountains of science and history...yet there are still people who insist that we don't need to vaccinate. Even on the less extreme side, how many people insist we don't need unions anymore? \n\nI hope with every fiber of my person that I never, ever have to use the firearms that I own in anger. I don't want to hurt people, I don't want to fight. But I also know that if I give up the ability to defend myself or help stand up for others and the time comes when I may have no choice, I'm going to be in trouble and that might cost me or someone else everything.","created_utc":1527273560,"score":42,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I can eat one chicken and get what would take many plants to provide.  Even if the chicken ate plants (and bugs) first, plants require fertilization, which is the decay of organic matter, which means plants require death to exist.  How far back down the chain does one have to count to tally up how much suffering was on their plate?  Is it just what I eat?  Or what I eat ate?  Or what I eat ate, and what that ate?\n\nAnyway, its all an immaterial silly argument, provoked by your insertion of an unproven premise - that one should try to reduce suffering and prioritize this over their own nutritional needs, which no other species on earth has ever done.\n\nFurther, you exclude from this moral calculus all of the industry necessary to do things like grow cereal grains and soy, etc.  It all requires fossil fuel pulled from oceans, river deltas, and other ecosystems which get destroyed in the process.  It requires massive machines which are made from metals mined out of mountains and razed forests, which leeches toxins into the environment.  The machines kill countless field mice, frogs, snakes, moles, and anything else that might eek out a living in the desert that is a corn field.

Are they old enough to cognizant-ly and competently oppress the people, in the absence of their parents?\n\n\n\nRemember: Ivan the Terrible was 15 when he ordered one of the feudal lords to be killed... At Christmas dinner...and then declared himself Czar of all Russia.\n\n\n Now I kinda forgive him for his historical atrocities. Let me explain. Ivan the Terrible was brought up with the constant threat of assassination, his dad died as a result of a tumor when Ivan was 3, his mom was poisoned when he was anywhere from 5-7, he was raised by servants, his vassals used him as a puppet when he was young and the church made him think that he was sent by God to recreate the monarchies of the Old Testament. This upbringing would turn anyone into a psychotic psychopath like Ivan\n\n\n\nWhy did I mention this? Before we consider someone an oppressor, and murder him by merit of his\/her parents occupation, we should at least look at how his\/her parents raised him\/her.\n\n\nRemember: Monarchs are usually either good to the point where they are almost forgivable, bad to the point where you want to convert to an Abrahamaic religion just do that you can believe they are in hell, or forgettable to the point where you fall asleep on your desk as your history professor rattles on about their reign.\n\n\n\nIn other words; you can have Ivan, Caligula, Mary I of England (Bloody Mary), James II of Scotland (literally inspired GoT's Red Wedding, with his so called \"Black Dinners\") Isabella I (Responsible for the Spanish Inquisition) Et Cetera, Et Cetera...\n\n\n\n\nOr you could have: Princess Diana (Donated millions to HIV research after it became an issue in the 80's, met with Nelson Mandela to discuss HIV, visited homeless shelters, and donated much of her royal \"earnings\" to over 100 causes.) Augustus Ceasar ( invested seriously in infrastructure, tax reform and his rule is known by historians as the \"Pax Romana\" ((Roman peace)), Louis XIV of France  ( ended the feudal system in France, modernized the nation and let culture flourish)\n\n\n\nOr you could have any of the thousands of Kings and oligarchs you've never been bothered to learn, because their reign was so insignificant in the grand scheme of their nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm not apologizing for what monarchy has done; it was a shitty 8,000 years before the ideas of Human Rights, democracy and labor rights came about... For at least 8,000 reasons. I'm just asking you.

{"author":"Liathbeanna","body":"If a western constitutional monarchy was somehow overthrown, I don't think even the death of the monarch would be necessary. Royal families are in their position purely because they are tolerated, rather than supported. So they aren't really necessary tools for the continuation of the  ruling system. The ruling class of the world is no longer aristocracy, but the bourgeois. And bourgeois can rule just as well without monarchy. So, in the event of a revolution, counter\\-revolutionaries, i.e. liberals, would fight to restore the parliamentary democracy, private property and whatnot, not monarchy.\n\nIf you aren't concerned with all that, and simply want justice for the crimes of the family, I still think it's a bad idea. I believe in individual judgements based on literal evidence of misdeed. I think it's simply not a good idea to execute a whole group of people without actually judging them, just because they were born into a family. It's just wrong, there's no way to justify collective punishment.\n\n You don't need to kill the royal family to destroy monarchy, just as how you don't need to execute the whole class of bourgeois to end capitalism.

{"author":"Zaratustash","body":"This reminds me so much of the dialogue from Camus' \"The Justs\".\n\nIt's a rough dialogue, where one of the revolutionaries lost all his family from famine and repression, spent most of their life in a Tsarist prison, and just gives no fucks, argues violently against a \"poetic soul\" (his insult) and the other comrades of his cell, after an assassination attempt was stopped when the cell realized the Tsarist official was travelling with his kids. The rest of the cell eventually get their way, and manage to get to their target when they are alone, but also realise that their oppressor does not value the lives of their childs, so why should they.\n\nIt also reminds me of a specific moment in Franz Fanon's \"Wretched of the Earth\" describing a slave who lost their child, and participates in an uprising the very same night. Suffice it to say the entire slaver's family gets it. \n\nSorry, I'm not really answering the question, of course it's not OK, its repulsive. A part of me, however, understands why revolutionaries killed Louis the XVIth's kid, or why revolutionaries killed the entire Romanov family, or why slaves in slave revolts burned out their slavers' house with little care as to who was in it and whether they were adults. \n\nI don't have the rage to do that, and I'm in a way very grateful not to, but in the case of the character in Camus' play, or the desperation of the revolutionaries in france or russia from centuries of hardships, of thousands of dead childrens due to oppression, I can see why moral qualms felt rather meaningless.

That is when they aren't memeing. I for one do enjoy going on full Robespierre discourse, but its for cathartis. Taking online leftist spaces discursively seriously is silly.\n\nAnd I certainly would not describe revolutionaries from the periods we discussed as \"tankies\". \n\nThe violence of oppressors has shifted significantly in the capitalist core over the past hundred years, and, thus, revolutionary popular violence has shifted too. I'm pretty sure it is not controversial to say that children should not be harmed when it comes to anti-capitalist anti-state struggles in the capitalist core, and I have not met a single leftist, may they be \"tankie\" or anarchist who has argued differently in real life. As \/u\/Liathbeanna said a Robesperian purge of monarchs would not be necessary, and I would add, would be unlikely, and tbh, should be opposed. Now trials of bourgeois for their crimes, that I would expect, and I would support.\n\nIt is certainly a different story when it comes to struggles in the neo-colonial periphery tho: our countries still kill children directly or indirectly, in most brutal ways, racialized people from the global south. Who am I to tell them \"tss tss tsss now, be moral in your efforts to deal with your oppressors\"? Being Kantian in terms of morality here is simply absurd.\n\n\nSo ya, I guess my take when it comes to revolutionary violence is that everything you do that what was done to you, your class, and your people to your oppressors is excusable, but unnecessary violence that does not serve the goal of either re-humanization of the oppressed, or their long term victory, should be avoided.\n","created_utc":1527305922,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

While I admire many anarchistic principles I would not be defined as an Anarchist at all, so given the nature of this subreddit as a place for organisation and support rather than ideological debate that is my mistake and you are within your rights to roast my post with a minimum of defensiveness from myself. \n","created_utc":1527414210,"score":-1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"The-Fold-Up","body":"Yeah I mean, anyone that denies there\u2019s a unique and awful problem in the United States with mass shootings is absolutely delusional. Pointing out that imperialism and war is worse is a complete misdirection. Obviously the USA is the biggest exporter of violence in the world, but we can still try to fix terrible things that happen in our own communities.\n\nI\u2019m pro-gun, pro armed working class, all that shit. But if people around you are afraid to go to big public events because they\u2019re scared of being shot, and there are mass shootings like every month, and the only thing you have to say about it is \u201cwell we can\u2019t disarm the working class, or else we won\u2019t have an anarchist\/communist revolution\u201d you\u2019re kinda out of touch. Most people in America, like someone else in this thread said, don\u2019t have any form of class consciousness. There\u2019s a leftward swing amongst young people, but the working class has no autonomous organizations that are even capable of fighting for reforms, forget about fighting an insurgency against the state. We should be building the capacity for such a struggle because that\u2019s what revolution entails realistically, but a lack of guns isn\u2019t what\u2019s holding revolution back. Also FYI: a civil war, insurgent class struggle situation wouldn\u2019t be fought with legal guns with serial numbers. Also, right now, self-defense against the state with guns is something that is literally impossible right now unless you want to flee the country. I don\u2019t want to police anyone\u2019s resistance but if you are wedded to a course of action like that then you have no reason to even consider for a second debates about the legality and regulation of anything.\n\nEven the slogan of gun control \u201cdisarming the working class\u201d is a little bit problematic because the people with the most guns are suburban, petite bourgeois reactionary white dudes, and a lot of working class ppl, esp. working class black ppl support gun control in some form. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a reason to not have an armed movement capable of self defense, or that we shouldn\u2019t put forth our own ideas as anarchists, but we should definitely avoid simplifying shit for our narrative. \n\nI\u2019m not saying we should be pro-extensive gun control at all, but I\u2019d say maybe accept some small compromises (maybe universal background checks and waiting periods) that could curb some of this violence while we organize to attack the actual roots of the problem and build a society that\u2019s less sick then this. Be armed, especially if you are involved with anti fascist work, but don\u2019t lean on guns as a symbol of militancy because an actual movement isn\u2019t there.","created_utc":1527437042,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Awale-Ismail","body":"Indeed. And not just about Anarchism but I think we need to try educating people on what Socialism and Communism actually mean as well. Honestly, until I randomly chanced upon a [Libertarian Socialist Rants](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/ElectricUnicycleCrew) video maybe 2 years ago, I had no idea that Socialism referred to worker's control over the means of production and basically thought it meant Social-Democracy; likewise, I had no clue that the core of Communism mandated a moneyless, classless and eventually stateless society where there is common ownership over the means of production... I thought Communism just meant Leninism and this is sadly how most people think whether in the US or here in the 3rd world where I am. \n\nMost folks have been **very** effectively propagandized against far-left ideas to a point where they don't even grasp the basics of our worldview and instead believe in caricatured or outright false versions of what we stand for and that needs to change soon. I've noticed an uptick lately in our overall exposure (especially in *the West)* and people are gradually starting to see through all the right-wing \"intellectuals\" out there on platforms like YouTube but we still need way more. I don't know a single person at my university, for example, who can actually define Anarchism or Communism for me. Hell, we haven't even fully taken back the word *Anarchism* from reich-wing charlatans because some people, at least online, think I mean *Anarcho-Capitalism* when I type that I'm an Anarchist. :-|\n\nBut good luck to you in spreading awareness. I sadly can't do much where I am right now because it's basically a Capitalist Monarchy where I'd be *disappeared* pretty quick for publicly spreading a political ideology (granted, they don't really care what I do in private like on reddit as long as I don't speak ill of the monarchy, lol) so I'm just gonna wait until I leave this place (quite soon now) and go back to my homeland (Somalia) where it won't be nearly as difficult to spread Anarchist ideas (weak local governments and ultimately a Republican-system with \"freedom of speech\" so long as you don't speak ill of the state religion alongside some other obvious caveats).

(I agree, which is why I don't identify as an anarchist. I lurk this sub because anarchism is the political philosophy to which I'm most sympathetic.) But anarchism has already been defined as an *ordered* society, free of involuntary hierarchies.

There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as William Godwin and Wilhelm Weitling, but they did not use the word \"anarchist\" or \"anarchism\" in describing themselves or their beliefs.[33]\n\n&gt;The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nAt several points it does point out that archos and archon can both mean leader and authority, and you are wrong in trying to limit it to your convenient definition. It also explicitly states Proudhon was the first political philosopher to call himself anarchist. Anarchism as a  philosophy explicitly meant opposition to hierarchy, not the state.

I have a weird form of describing nations,  and you can only describe them in the base of someone self identifying as such. Muh clay is a spook, as well as muh boundaries.  It's just a feeling of relating to a particular group of people and a sense of community for living life in a particular way, which there is nothing wrong with it. Nations are people, what you just said are states. And what you want is people to live as blank canvases devoid of substance, and is actually impossible to do because of the way the human being works. If you pick an international group of people and have them move together to a commune and live together without much foreign contact, they will eventually form feelings of relation towards each other and the space they share, which will constitute a new nation in itself.\n\n&gt;The preservation of artefacts doesn't impact society in the way that nationhood does. To preserve what remains of ancient egypt doesn't invest the modern egyptians in archaic tradition, it doesn't arbitrarily join some and seperate others.\n\nThe whole point is that people are forced to resign of their culture because the system makes it so it is not convenient for them, and erases their way of being which deserves to be preserved, as it is what makes us humans, social beings who have their traditions that must be respected as long as they don't step on others.

This is because they only follow orders and aren't acting and thinking for themselves as individuals.  They are all supposed to enforce one law.  The idea behind the uniform and the law is that every cop should respond to every situation exactly the same, as a mindless enforcer of law.  Im certain you've seen or heard a cop give you or someone else a ticket or arrest someone while saying, \"sorry my hands are tied I have to do this.\"  That is them intentionally ruling out their own judgement to be just a \"cop.\"\n\nCops can act nice, or sweet, or caring, they can help old ladies across the street or buy kids ice cream cones or play with their dogs in the park, but at the end of the day they are enforcers of a system that is at its core oppressive.  And when they get the order to do something terrible for that system they will.

Maybe that makes the dreads even on black bodies lose some of what their meaning was, the meaning shifts and changes etc, but there's a near infinite amount of symbols people can use to express\/construct their identities and if dreads lose their coolness to a social group over time then they might just find something else instead to fill that same kind of gap. \n","created_utc":1527615063,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"iheartennui","body":"There are some cool ideas in here but much of it seems very unrealistic. Do you really think if people had all the freedom they don't have now, they would decide to become hunter-gatherers or rural farmers using 19th century level technology? That people outside urban centers would be satisfied to have no internet and manage to communicate to other humans with only radio?\n\nHe does mention a population loss of one third of humanity, so maybe there was some kind of catastrophe that prompted the shift he describes. This is the only way I could imagine such a transition happening. It's the only way that any such shift has happened historically - most people don't willingly live harder and more precarious lives hunting and foraging unless by absolute necessity. I am pretty sure an anarchist society would never successfully transition this way voluntarily.\n\nYes, we like to romanticise how hunter gatherers were egalitarian and only worked 10 hours a week to get enough food. But they didn't have food stores that lasted years the way we do. They didn't have complex manufacturing infrastructure to make it possible to have all the feats of engineering we've grown used to. And not just grown used to but rely on to survive. We need bridges and buildings and cities to contain all the humans. A population of one third less than we have now still could not be supported on earth through hunting and gathering - we'd hunt everything to extinction. Maybe it's possible with 19th century agricultural tech but that's a lot more work for everyone so I don't see it staying that way.\n\nSo basically, I just don't see how humans wouldn't take advantage of existing technologies to make it possible to live within the existing infrastructure, even if they were doing so in an egalitarian way. Even after a catastrophe, people could repurpose modern things without going back to full hunter-gatherer mode the way people have been forced to when civilisational collapses happened historically (and I still think they kept some minimal tech).\n\nSo we could downsize a lot of the factories making useless consumer products, sure, but even Gelderloos mentions that we would still be producing computers. [Making even the simplest version of a personal computer requires immense levels of infrastructure, resources, and labour](https:\/\/worldbuilding.stackexchange.com\/a\/54981). A society that has access to such technology - and it would be just so silly to give up access to it because computers are so useful - necessarily has massive mines, factories, shipping routes, etc. There are surely cleaner ways of having all of these things but I doubt we have 100% carbon free ways yet, or maybe even ever.\n\nThere is some sort of odd romanticism for a simpler past in the linked text and I find it problematic. There just is no way of naturally \"going backwards\" for humans in history. I'm not against the ideas of simple living and I personally believe that climate change and our use of carbon is the number one issue facing us. I also don't believe in a high tech futurist\/transhumanist solution to the problem either - with genetics and crypto and uploading our minds to the web or whatever. But I do think our society is highly complex and that we need it to remain so - on some level that is not as idyllic or utopian as the candles (made of what exactly? so much less efficient than LEDs) and homeopathy and corn cob power plants that Gelderloos has dreamed up. I don't have much more to contribute in the way of an answer though, it is a very tough question.\n\nThanks for the link OP. I wish these topics were more often discussed here. It would be great to brainstorm some concrete action we could take based on these concerns in an effort to move towards something more sustainable.","created_utc":1527617118,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"CaucasianDelegation","body":"As you say you are still new to anarchism, I thought I'd share my take on your question! \n\nRight off the bat I'd say a lot of that is just people being edgy. Calling all soldiers \"baby killers\" because they willfully joined a military, a decision open to criticism, shouldn't be treated as an absolute moral failing. As you said, a lot of people enlist because it is their best option to escape their current circumstances and we must be understanding of this. While I think it's a safe assumption that we are all critical of the military here, I do feel comfortable acknowledging the logic behind their decision despite my feelings towards the organization they joined. \n\nI do disagree however with your point about not being allowed to have an opinion on the matter if you don't know service members or have lost a loved one. That would be like saying you can't have an opinion about murder unless your loved one was killed, or rape if you have never been so yourself. Wars and soldiering go hand in hand, one creates the need for the other. There are some things in life (war, murder, rape, etc) that are so horrible that all people have the right to speak on them. One's right to speak on an issue shouldn't be exclusively limited to their personal experiences. Lots of generals have never been in combat and historians can't time travel, but through thorough research you can build a more nuanced perspective. Anarchists believe in personal agency and autonomy, telling an anarchist they can't say something because it offends your sensibilities is...well...not going to happen.\n\nIf you are wondering why people would be so critical of the the US military, the veneration of veterans, and the forced patriotism in the US, then I would recommend Howard Zinn's \"A People's History of the United States\". The history of US military actions abroad has been largely driven by the demand for profit and resources. Saying soldiers \"defend our freedoms\" that they \"gave us\" doesn't really hold up through a purely historical lens. \n\nAnyways, there's my rant, I also attached a .pdf if you are interested in a good read :).\nhttp:\/\/library.uniteddiversity.coop\/More_Books_and_Reports\/Howard_Zinn-A_peoples_history_of_the_United_States.pdf\n\n ","created_utc":1527621861,"score":4,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

There are basically three kinds of anarchist economy.\n\n1) Mutualism. You still buy and trade things with people, but every workplace is run democratically and its easy to squat unused land. Also, banks are run way better and are less corrupt (mutual-banking)\n\n2) Collectivism\/Participatory Economics. There is still money (reward for work) but no exchange. You get allocated credits calculated via how much work you've done for the community that you can then purchase stuff with. In theory, this system has no inflation or recessions, and inequality isn't created through violence or privilege.\n\n3) Communism (dun dun dun). Things are held in common.

{"author":"va_str","body":"Capitalism is based on class distinctions. There are those who own property they do not directly use themselves, like an entire factory or a second house, and they use this to coerce services, goods or currency from others, such as part of their labour or rent. Due to the nature of this kind of exchange, it is neither voluntary (people need to participate because they need housing and food), nor is it a fair exchange, since the capitalist is in a much better bargaining position to set the terms. Even if we assume a full reset and everyone starts out owning the same, the competitive nature of capital accumulation and the fact that people's interests, skills, abilities and even plain luck are different, the same trend takes effect. A class with and a class without form, and the former keeps shrinking in numbers and growing in wealth, while the opposite is true for the latter. Capitalism is therefore not compatible with the aim to dismantle oppressive hierarchies, as it does the exact opposite and creates them.\n\nThis is one aspect of it, anyway, and doesn't even touch the distribution problems we face in profit markets, or the horrible social environment this forced competition creates in our society. Capitalism is our primary enemy, and its core aspects have been our enemy in the thousands of years before it was capitalism and before we were anarchist.\n\nOf all the flavours of anarchists, and yes, some of which have some differences with us ancoms, \"anarcho\"-capitalism is fundamentally incompatible with all of them.","created_utc":1527622590,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

And I don't think we should pretend otherwise. People's needs differ, material conditions differ, etc. Some people may want to organize around markets, with networks of individuals and cooperatives trading good and services through a decentralized currency, with the means of production owned by the people who use them. Others may want to organize around communism, where goods and services are done according to need, the means of production are owned in common, and trade no longer exists. And we can probably see lots of variations and mixtures on those (i.e. a non-circulating labor voucher system, or the family wage system implemented in the Spanish Revolution, etc). Personally, I think making any one system the dominate system will make an anarchist economy unstable.\n\nMost folks here don't like political parties, including the pro-capitalist Libertarian Party.

State police got uppity and got the same leeway, I live near a highway and today they were there inspecting trucks in full combat gear with full-auto rifles at their side (state patrol, outside Rio, rarely packs more than a handgun).

A few are resisting, and those need support and might even join a worthy direct action group - they have shown to crave direction.

{"author":"Anargnome-Communist","body":"&gt; 1.) Do you believe there should be no one regulating banks and businesses?\n\nThere shouldn't be banks or businesses to regulate.\n\n&gt; 2.) Do you believe that someone should monitor climate change to curb the greenhouse effect?\n\nYes. Note that currently the monitoring part is happening, but the curbing part is mostly absent.\n\n&gt; 3.) How should we defend ourselves in inevitable war? How would we organize?\n\nI don't think war is an inevitable as you make it out to be, but in case it does happen there are several historical examples to fall back on. If those historical examples aren't useful, organizing should be done in whatever way the community sees fit.\n\n&gt; 4.) Where do you think we need control, if anywhere at all?\n\nI don't think \"control\" would be a useful concept in an anarchist society, at least not in the way we use it today. People have influence over their community and their environment and the community and environment has influence over people. How we guide that influence is dependent on many factors, but we should strive to ensure health, peace, freedom, etc. for everyone in the way we guide that influence.\n\n&gt; 5.) How can we prevent a new government taking control?\n\nI have a two-fold answer to this:\n\n1. Show that our system is better, by providing the same and more, but without coercion. Create real and tangible ways to provide what people need with maximum freedom, so that the creation of a government becomes unthinkable. \n2. The same way we got rid of government in the first place, except easier because it can be stopped before it becomes massively oppressive.\n\n&gt; 6.) Do you dream of a society ruled by vigilante justice? Could this get out of hand?\n\nI think \"justice\" as most people use it in everyday speech is a misguided concept. The world we currently live in has no true justice, only systems of oppression and control. I don't believe in punitive justice, but would rather focus on rehabilitation, restoration and prevention, all of which are much easier if you have strong communities of people with enough freedom and time to take an interest in their community and the people that make up said community.\n\n&gt; 7.) How do we prevent violence from getting out of hand?\n\nBy not having powerful people who have a great number of tools to inflict violence on people like we have right now. Other than that, we can dismantle all the other oppressive systems that lead to violence. We can never fully eliminate violence, but we can create communities where violence isn't a good option.\n\n&gt; 8.) How would we prove our legitimacy to other countries? How can we ensure that we continue to develop?\n\nThe anarchist project is global, so ideally there are no other countries. Realistically, you don't care about legitimacy because that's ultimately unimportant. No government will ever acknowledge a large-ish anarchist project as legitimate, so why put too much energy in that?\n\nWhat do you mean by \"develop?\"\n\n&gt; 9.) What should the government have control over? What should it not?\n\nThere should be no government.\n\n&gt; 10.) Should the government have weapons? Should the public?\n\nThere should be no government. Weapons can be available to people, but we should strive for a society in which they aren't necessary. Everyone should be trained in self-defense.\n\n&gt; 11.) How will laws be enforced? How would we avoid police violence?\n\nThere should be no laws. There should be no police.\n\n&gt; 12.) What would the ideal form of government be? True democracy? A republic? A meritocracy?\n\nThere should be no government.\n\n&gt; 13.) How else do your beliefs differ from those of true anarchists? What other doubts should we have in true anarchy?\n\nI don't think \"true anarchist\" is a meaningful term. I also don't think any of the questions above count as \"doubts\" in anarchy, since most anarchists have a pretty good idea on how to address them. The sort of \"doubts\" anarchists have about their position tend to be more practical, such as how to organize specific things or what role (if any) markets should play under anarchism.","created_utc":1527674254,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

At the beginning of the call and again in the middle he says of the pistol \"it's probably fake\".\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1527683581,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I'm not pointing that he should just leave and risk losing his job, but rather that we shouldn't support the manipulation of workers - hence it doesn't seem wrong to support the efforts to bring this strike\/lockout to an end. Corporate interests are a major force at play, obviously, and defending the strike\/lockout means we're actually going against the interest of workers.\n\n&gt;They offer fascism because it is what they know, and they crave being on the bottom of some hierarchy because someone told that there is the only place they deserve to be.\n\nI agree fully. But if we tolerate the fascist uprising just because workers are being manipulated, we're being complacent. I'm not gonna argue that our democracy works perfectly, but between a failed democracy and an oppressive regime that actively suppresses rights, I think I'd much rather not endorse any kind of effort that intends to make everyone's lives even worse.\n\nAlso, let me say that the concessions made by the government already answer the demands of the independent truckers! Those workers have got better conditions already! I don't see a reason to keep tolerating the strike, as it is just a tool to keep the population hostage to fascist interests. The other workers won't see any real benefit from this.

{"author":"Anargnome-Communist","body":"&gt; But just for the sake of clarification, how could we ensure scientific development?\n\nFirst of all, we would stop squandering the minds of everyone who doesn't have the time or resources to follow their natural curiosity. By giving everyone basic necessities and access to the world's knowledge, more people could put their energy towards scientific pursuits. Currently, the scientifically minded are wasting energy competing rather than cooperation and trying to appease the ruling class in order to secure funding. If instead, people were able to find people with similar interests or goals and were able to freely work on whatever catches their interest, we'd probably see more science, not less. Sure, we might have less full-time scientists, but that's not a loss.\n\n&gt; If there are no markets, how will we get goods and services?\n\nBasic necessities and things that are in abundance would be freely distributed and\/or given to other communities. For goods that are scarce, different solutions have been proposed by different anarchists and going into them all would take a lot of time. Some anarchists do like markets, others have different solutions, such as labor vouchers, cooperating with others who want those goods as well, trade, rearranging life and society to make sure people don't need certain goods, etc.\n\n&gt; And, lastly, how can we guarantee that global warming is curved?\n\nHonestly, the chance that we tackle global warming under capitalism is infinitesimally small, so if I were a cynic, I could just point out that you shouldn't hold anarchism to higher standards than the status quo on this.\n\nHowever, if fully believe that anarchy is one of the few viable ways of dealing with climate change, or at least has a high chance of mitigating its effects. An anarchist world or society would be organized radically different from what we have today and by getting rid of profit incentives, we would get rid of several things that are extremely harmful for the environment. No more fossil fuels, no more giant factories producing goods no-one wants, no more planned obsolescence, no more being overly reliant on cars, no more giant farms, no more cutting the forests, etc.  \n\nIf you're interested in seeing a more complete answer to this question, I find [this essay](https:\/\/libcom.org\/library\/anarchist-solution-global-warming) rather inspiring.

They're just scared and not brave enough to see the world for what it is...and no I don't mean what's on the news or online or in a book.  I mean what's actually going on in the real world.\n\nThey don't step out of their comfort zones, so they insulate themselves, just like the radical left or liberals or conservatives or moderates.  We all do this.  It's just in our nature because it's difficult to accept the chaos that's out there outside our borders or even beyond.  That's why we cling to familiarity.  Doesn't mean what we're familiar with is always right.  And of course the act of clinging on to what we most believe in can lead to very dangerous acts for better and for worse.\n\nBut by knowing the basic psychology behind such belief systems you can begin to humanize these bizzare rationatlities that appear self-defeating, such as racism or islamaphobia.  And by humanizing them you can connect to the problem and in a real sense help each other figure it out.  \n\nObviously islamaphobia is bad, but so is violence against people who are islamaphobic and who aren't actually physically doing anything to harm someone.  Yes, there are people who do harm others in the name of such beliefs but there are a lot who wouldn't lift a finger or even support such violence against them.  \n\nBut really at the end of the day all of this is a blowback from our need\/desire for oil, so these people who are islamaphobic probably wouldn't be if we weren't invested so much in extracting oil and money from the Middle East.  And if our desire for oil and fossil fuels didn't exist then climate change would be happening at a Muuuch slower rate.  So much so that it wouldn't even be a problem for the World and thus, millions of people wouldn't be flooding over to Europe.  The culture clash brought out a natural response just like our natural response against those who responded against Muslims.  Just like the response many Muslims made against the West.  Isis, alt rights, the re-surgence of anarchism, all of it is a blowback to the mistakes our leaders made because they didn't care about us.  None of us.\n\nSo, how do I have a nice time with people who are radically different from me?  I bravely stand above all of it and instead of succumbing to my natural urge to cower into familiarity, I embrace the chaotic truth about ourselves.  We are all victims of those who put us here.  It's not the conservatives or the radical Muslims or even antifa or the liberal Hillary supporters.

A Roman legion armed with shields, spears, and swords, would carve an equal number of non-veteran American civilians armed with rifles into chum.  \n\nThe people (military, police, and criminal) for whom Force is a profession, have chosen the second of two options...  live by producing, or live by \u201cprotecting\u201d those who produce.
