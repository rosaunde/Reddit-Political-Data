They may boycott certain products, refuse to eat certain foods, or they may show up to marches or rallies whose only purpose is to demonstrate the moral superiority of the participants.  White people may loudly claim that they recognize their privilege or declare themselves allies of people of color or other marginalized groups.  People may declare their communities \u201cno place for hate.\u201d  Or they may show up at counter-marches to \u201cstand up\u201d to white nationalists or neo-Nazis.  All of these types of \u201cactivism\u201d emphasize self-improvement or self-expression rather than seeking concrete change in society or policy.  They are deeply, and deliberately, apolitical in the sense that they do not seek to address issues of power, resources, decisionmaking, or how to bring about change.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oddly, these activists who have claimed the mantle of racial justice seem committed to an individualized, apolitical view of race.  The diversity industry has become big business, sought out by universities and companies seeking the cachet of inclusivity.  Campus diversity offices channel student protest into alliance with the administration and encourage students to think small.  While adept in the terminology of power, diversity, inclusion, marginalization, injustice, and equity, they studiously avoid topics like colonialism, capitalism, exploitation, liberation, revolution, invasion, or other actual analyses of domestic or global affairs.  Lumping race together in an ever-growing list of marginalized identities allows the history and realities of race to be absorbed into a billiard ball theory of diversity, in which different dehistoricized identities roll around a flat surface, occasionally colliding.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let us be very clear.  The white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville, hate-filled and repugnant as their goals may be, are not the ones responsible for the U.S. wars on Iraq, Syria, and Yemen.  They are not responsible for turning our public school system over to private corporations.  They are not responsible for our separate and unequal health care system that consigns people of color to ill health and early death.  They are not the ones foreclosing and evicting people of color from their homes.  They are not the authors of neoliberal capitalism with its devastating effects on the poor around the planet.  They are not the ones militarizing the borders to enforce global apartheid.  They are not behind the extraction and burning of fossil fuels that is destroying the planet, with the poor and people of color the first to lose their homes and livelihoods.  If we truly want to challenge racism, oppression, and inequality, we should turn our attention away from the few hundred marchers in Charlottesville and towards the real sources and enforcers of our unjust global order.

What follows is capitalism.\n\n&gt;Surplus value will be extracted...\n\nSurpus value, in as much as it applies to a socialist society, would be fundamentally distinct. Surplus value of the capitalist kind presupposes non-participation in the production of a commodity. If you have a legal system that enforces worker ownership then that procludes non-workers (non-participations in production) from extracting any value. As such any surplus value would be recieved by the workers at the behest of the workers.\n\n&gt;Also we are in a very economicist conversation...\n\nSocialism doesn't cure sexism or racism or any form of oppression other than the oppression of the worker under the capitalist. A socialist society can be racist or sexist or homophobic and still be socialist. The fact that identity politics has been mobilized by the bourgeoisie in order to encourage consumerism or undermine proletarian struggles is irrelevant to whether or not they factor into what makes socialism socialism.\n\n&gt;Switching ownership from a single bourgeois to a multiplicity of workers changes absolutely nothing about that\n\nWell it probably will as it better dissolves the distinction between worker and consumer.

That includes co-ordinating and training militias, holding a territorial border against an enemy force, or collecting surplus for provisioning purposes.\n\nHow is this different from any other government? The majority of citizens in my country agree that my nation should have a mandatory service for national defense, a large social benefit blanket, and that we should govern ourselves in a parliamentary democracy because we citizens don't have the time to devout to the inner running of a nation. \n\nYou aren't going to just \"govern yourselves\", after a certain amount of people, whether it be 40 or 100, you are going to be a organizational structure that most often results in a hierarchy. Training militia's and collecting \"surplus\" sounds alot like the levy of troops and taxes in statism. \n\n&gt; Or he doesn't. Maquisards shot Nazi officers without becoming Nazi officers. \n\nYou are misinterpreting, the Maquisards weren't anarchists, and they wanted to *overthrow* the Nazi's with their own form of statism which was the free france republic. They weren't fighting for anarchism, they were fighting for a free france, which is a statist france either way. Many French also cooperated with the Nazi puppet Vichy government. \n\n&gt; The culture flip required for a partisan motivated enough to assassinate a warlord to change to coveting his position, plus the problem of getting the subordinates -- presumably each with loyal forces and each imagining himself as successor instead -- to agree that an interloper with far fewer forces is now leader, make it unlikely. Plus... another guerilla can just shoot the new guy.\n\nYou realize that the french resistance was run by a hierarchy too, and they only became effective (even though they weren't a big part of the war effort) after it was united with allied command?\n\n&gt; You're asking for historical examples of events which pre-suppose that a different political arrangement be in place throughout history. There are no examples in our written history of anarchist territories coming together to defend a region because there are not yet areas in the world where anarchism is the norm and warlords are the outliers.\n\nHumanity arise from anarchism no? From tribal bands to civilization? If there are no examples of anarchism you must ask yourself if it is even attainable. Even communism existed but it didn't have a fair run for its money. \n\n&gt; If you had asked how a capitalist society would defend itself from feudalist uprisings prior to the emergence of widespread capitalism, there wouldn't have been any examples of it in the recorded history, either.\n\nThere are plenty of examples. The whole notion of a [nation-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_state) which anarchism is against, rose up because people began to identify themselves more with France and Frenchmen, Germany and Germans, Denmark and Danes, etc. With increased technologies, cultural interactions, education, and patriotism rulers and citizens alike saw the nation-state as a better way of organizing society. Capitalism makes a bigger buck than feudalism, which isn't inherently an economic system at all. \n\n&gt; If your next question is \"how do we get to widespread anarchy\", then the answer is the same as with the spread of capitalism: \"Keep trying everything until something works.\"\n\nA nation-state will always destroy an anarchic community which is weaker.","created_utc":1519938546,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

These reactions cause the media to cover the event, which gives him a larger audiance to speak to, this is similar to (but distinct from) the \"propaganda by the deed\" tactics of early anarchists, in which a spectacle is caused (usually symbolic, like blowing up a building that stands for something oppressive), and then being caught and stating the message in the trial, which was always covered by the newspapers of the time.

More to the point, if you *didn't* agree, how would you realistically change it without populist actions like standing up to those cops and taking back that property?\n\nI've no doubt that some anarchist communities will adopt representative systems at higher levels where direct democracy becomes difficult. If they're smart, they'll limit the power of those reps and make them *actually* accountable and equal to the public  they serve, with powers like immediate recall and overrides, instead of enthroning temporary nobles with generous lame duck periods like liberal \"democracies\" do.\n\nWe're not obliged to display our 'anarchism' in a manner dictated by outside observers, as you seem to want. If we have to pick up a statist's gun to keep statists out, we'll do it. Likewise if we need to adopt formations in our armies which \"sound like\" statist ones to you, we will. Because they're not really statist -- they're technologies which happen to have been developed under statism.\n\nI suspect an anarchist army would probably have more *actual* volunteers instead of poor families' kids looking for a way to escape the trap, though. And *far* less petty abuse and rule-by-fear than a statist one with the power to completely destroy your life for non-compliance.\n\n&gt; You are misinterpreting, the Maquisards weren't anarchists, and they wanted to overthrow the Nazi's with their own form of statism which was the free france republic.\n\nI'm not. A statist fought another statist without converting to his ideology. But you think it's somehow more likely with an anti-statist, despite the same amount of hate between them?\n\n&gt; You realize that the french resistance was run by a hierarchy too, and they only became effective (even though they weren't a big part of the war effort) after it was united with allied command?\n\nThe weak become stronger when lent strength. That's a natural fact which has nothing to do with anarchism versus statism.\n\n&gt; Humanity arise from anarchism no? From tribal bands to civilization? If there are no examples of anarchism you must ask yourself if it is even attainable. Even communism existed but it didn't have a fair run for its money.\n\nCivilization arose with agriculture. Agriculture allows greater population growth than can be sustained through hunting, and more people than can be sustained through hunting create a demand for more land with which to practice agriculture. *Those* are the defining variables. A tribe would have lost to an *anarchist* agricultural society the same way it lost to a statist one. As for communism, it \"existed\" in the same way as democracy \"exists\" in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea -- just authoritarians co-opting a desire for popular power to keep being authoritarians.\n\nMore to the point, you asked for examples from history. The emergence of agriculture happened *pre-*history. Accordingly, I have no specific examples... but then, neither do you. You can't say that the first agricultural societies *weren't* egalitarian ones that fell under the sway of a charismatic leader and decided to try centralizing because they had no idea what social ills it would lead to. But we do, because now we have history of it.\n\n&gt; There are plenty of examples.\n\nThere were plenty of *failed* examples, you mean.

Leaving the power in the hands of a few and enforcing their hold over it with killer cops and indoctrination is how we got to a climate that's about to snap and kill us all... among other failings.\n\n&gt; Capitalism makes a bigger buck than feudalism, which isn't inherently an economic system at all.\n\nOf course feudalism is an economic system. It's based on landlords handling defense and upkeep of a territory in exchange for the economic produce of the peasants who work the land.\n\nEconomics and politics are intimately linked. So much so that when economics emerged as a field of study, it was called \"the science of political economy\" and studied how household and production issues related to governance.","created_utc":1519961575,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Despite a multitude of experience, there has been very little in the way of sharing of experiences and building cohesion within the struggle against fascism.\n\n\nAgainst Fascism, the umbrella network of various local Against Fascism sections, along with Calgary Anti-Racist Action, and the Saskatoon Anti-Racist Organizing Committee, are pleased to announce the Conference of Anti-fascists in Canada. Occurring May 11-13, the conference will allow us begin to share the lessons we\u2019ve learned, solidify our approach, and plot a course forward for the struggle against fascism.\n\n\nWhile the details of the conference are still in the works, the goal is to build practical and political unity among militant antifascist organizations in Canada and to better coordinate our work in the future.\n\n\nThe conference will be open to all antifascist organizations in Canada who are active in the struggle against fascism. With few exceptions, this conference will not be open to non-aligned individuals. This is both to ensure a high level of security for this event, while also ensuring the conference is oriented towards anti-fascist practice.\n\n\nWe encourage any interested organizations to contact us at againstfascism@protonmail.com for more information. Registration will open soon.\n\n\nAccommodations such as food, billeting, and travel reimbursements may be made available depending on the support the conference receives. If you or an organization you\u2019re a part of would like to donate to the conference please let us know.

{"author":"cervance","body":"\"Centralised authority\" is not what Anarchism opposes, but rather unjustified authority.  As far as I know, three kinds of authority are still kosher in Anarchism:\n\nAuthority from expertise, which applies when someone can solve a problem for another person, and lasts until said problem is fixed. Mandatory vaccines and licenses and such fall under this category (to differentiate Anarchism from the mindlessness of right-wing Libertarians).\n\nWithering Authority, which is a kind of authoritative power which withers away through its use. Most notably, Lenin's conception of the proletarian state in \"The State and Revolution\" fits this description, though the USSR itself failed to meet the standard of withering authority. Teachers and parents also fall in this category - when they've done their job right, their authority over their charge withers away.\n\nand Democratic Authority, which covers a variety of democratic methods of running a civil government, including communalism, democratic confederalism, direct democracy, democratic centralism, immediate recall of representatives, etc. A \"civil\" government is necessary for the organization of everyday life of millions of people. Someone has to be in charge of water, sewage, bridges, etc, and they need to be accountable to the rest of society.\n\nI would also add that your definition fails to place Anarchism as a branch of Socialist and Communist thought. Socialism being the extension of democracy to the workplace, and production of goods for use, rather than for sale. Communism being a stateless, classless, and moneyless society, where each individual's freedom allows for each other individual's freedom.\n\nAnd as a final critique, I don't like the line \"without the use of force\" since justified force is necessary to bring reactionary elements in line.

{"author":"vetch-a-sketch","body":"Your entire point so far is that people with access to power don't want to give up that power, out of self-interest. Yet you suggest that the remedy is to vote and then... what? Cross my fingers that the rep won't second-guess me or do a half-assed job pursuing my goal, out of self-interest?\n\nRepresentative democracy is not \"just as easy\" as direct democracy. I not only have to study the issues myself, but also to study my representative and any opposing candidates, who all have every incentive to hide their failings. It's *at least* twice as time-consuming to be an *informed* voter under a representative system. If I'm going to put in all that effort, why wouldn't I just exit the system and push for direct democracy so that hopefully one day I can cut my workload in half?\n\nDirect democracy spreads power to all people. Then the self-interest and love of power becomes a balancing force instead of an unbalancing one, since we generally won't want to give up the power we have over the issues we care about.\n\n&gt; I'm not familiar with the term lent strength, can you explain it?\n\nSure I can. It's whatever you were talking about when you mentioned maquisards being assisted by Allied command.\n\n&gt; I agree that pre-history may have had a form of \"anarchism\" even though it was most likely tribal with the ruling male as the head of the hierarchy. We have pretty good record of recorded history where the first 'civilizations' were very centralized,\n\nNo kidding? The surviving recordings from the places where centralized power had influence over the recording process give a favorable impression of centralized power? Hmm.\n\nThe first cultivated crops emerged around 11000BC. The civilizations and recordings you're talking about are Bronze Age, meaning 3000BC or newer. Mind the gap.\n\nThis talk about old civilizations is also increasingly tangential, since to my knowledge, not one of them had access to the internet or rapid transit like the car, incredible tools for facilitating direct democracy and egalitarianism under the law. If you have to run a marathon every time you need to cast a vote, representatives and kings start to make more sense.

White people (less than 10% of the population) own more than 70% of South Africa's farmland, and let's be honest - they didn't get it or keep it through peaceful or legitimate means. These aren't subsistence farmers, they're capitalists who fear losing their capital. There's a reason we don't stand around with banners that say \"Seize the means of production then fairly compensate the owners!\". White people still have a virtual monopoly on South Africa's economy and every day that continues is another colossal act of theft. There's an incredibly gross history to this kind of \"compensation\", from the billions in reparations Haiti was forced to pay France for their revolution to the large sum paid *for each slave* to slave-owners following abolition in America.\n\nAlso, it's worth mentioning some of the wording of the petition, which makes the political views and goals of the signatories pretty clear.

On the other hand, if you don't buy a shirt that you don't need, you can rest easy knowing that you didn't take something (an exploited worker's labor) that didn't belong to you in the first place.\n\nMeat and animal products are kind of similar. The animal doesn't belong to you or anyone else. If you can live with taking the life that doesn't belong to you, then nobody is going to stop you and you don't suddenly become a non-anarchist. If you can bring yourself to avoid exploiting the animal, then you're causing less suffering and death in the world.\n\nBased on my limited understanding, a more theory based answer might be something like: Some Marxists will say that we should be fighting first for the proletariat--working class humans--and all other concerns are secondary at best, bourgeois at worst. Other people would say that animals are a sort of non-human proletariat, being exploited for their labor in the sense that everything the animal does, every moment of their existence serves the purpose of ending up on your plate.\n\nMy bias might be showing through but for me I try (I'm not a saint, but I do try) to do everything I can to avoid extra or unnecessary exploitation, so long as I can remain healthy and have my minimum needs met. I certainly think that a population that is conscious of the exploitation of animals and actively avoids it is also more likely to be conscious of forms of exploitation of humans and will be more likely to avoid that too.","created_utc":1520042849,"score":17,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I guess since you need it to be true to hold your whole argument together, it's not surprising.\n\nDirect democracy eliminates the hierarchy of one citizen over another in political power. Combine with small wealth gaps and freedom of voluntary association and bake for 20 minutes at 350 degrees to get one anarchism.\n\n&gt;They are literally not the same thing. The whole reason Adam Smith wrote The Wealth of Nations is to argue against mercantilism and promote capitalism.\n\nAnd one of the reasons Karl Marx wrote *Capital* was to point out that capitalism's economic aspect is defined by using starting wealth to produce or obtain an intermediary, not for the sake of having it, but to turn that intermediary into more capital. A relation which is also true for mercantilism, since gold is regarded as a kind of universal currency. It was early capitalism -- just a short-sighted kind with too much esteem for a relatively useless (at the time) shiny metal. The fact that *current* capitalists have too much esteem for relatively useless bits of paper only makes the parallel more uncanny.\n\n&gt; Capitalism promotes free markets and voluntary associations. It encourages import/export for all countries. Thats why there are many people who are anarcho-capitalism, and I don't see why you aren't one either. \n\nBecause it's riddled with contradiction.

Attracted to anarchism after the Haymarket riots, Goldman became a writer and a renowned lecturer on anarchist philosophy, women's rights, and social issues, attracting crowds of thousands.\n\n She and anarchist writer Alexander Berkman, her lover and lifelong friend, planned to assassinate industrialist and financier Henry Clay Frick as an act of propaganda of the deed. Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed, for \"inciting to riot\" and illegally distributing information about birth control.(around 1892) Goldman was imprisoned several times in the years that followed, for \"inciting to riot\" and illegally distributing information about birth control. \n\nIn 1917, Goldman and Berkman were sentenced to two years in jail for conspiring to \"induce persons not to register\" for the newly-instated draft. She was deported back to Russia.  Initially supportive of that country's October Revolution which brought the Bolsheviks to power, Goldman reversed her opinion in the wake of the Kronstadt rebellion and denounced the Soviet Union for its violent repression of independent voices. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she traveled to Spain to support the anarchist revolution there.\n\nShe died in Toronto on May 14, 1940, aged 70. During her life, Goldman was lionized as a freethinking \"rebel woman\" by admirers, and denounced by detractors as an advocate of politically motivated murder and violent revolution. Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including prisons, atheism, freedom of speech, militarism, capitalism, marriage, free love, and homosexuality. \n\nToday heralded as a founder of anarcha-feminism and queer-anarchism. Goldman was also an outspoken critic of prejudice against homosexuals. Her belief that social liberation should extend to gay men and lesbians was virtually unheard of at the time, even among anarchists. As German sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld wrote, \"she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public.\"\n\n&gt;\"Among my male and female friends, there are a few who are of either a completely **Uranian** (Uranian was an English adaptation of Urning, a German neologism at the time meaning either \u00a8person assigned male at birth who expressed as female (and vice versa).\u00a8).

I empathize deeply with them, for I know that their sufferings are of a larger and more complex sort than those of ordinary people.

{"author":"SirBrendantheBold","body":"Hey, I'm glad you're showing such an interest in the anarchist schools of thought. You actually seem to have started off with a misconception that is extraordinarily common. Anarchism is not the rejection of hierarchy. Hierarchy is a useful and natural function of every society and human expression since the dawn of our species.\n\nAnarchism is opposed to hierarchy which derives its structure from forced authority. Earned and forced authority is the fundamental distinction of the entire anarchist logic. If you consult with a doctor, you've consented to their earned authority by virtue of their expertise. If a municipal council or leader or firm manager is elected, you've consented to a hierarchy of earned authority with the understanding that they've particular talents that could benefit the respective members in administrating the minutia. \n\nIf however you have a boss in a capital entireprise, there was no deference given. A position of authority was granted without your consent and through deprivation and need your cooperation with their edicts is mandated by coercion. That is a forced hierarchy.\n\nThe presence of leaders is by no means an indication of either oppression or the failure of anarchist thought. It is simply the organising of a group of consensual people into an arrangement they believe will produce a more coherent, consistent, or communicative model. If those leaders start making demands of you and predicate your inclusion upon compliance with those demands, and those demands are not delineated by harm to others, then it would be a failure.\n\nEdit: A friendly reminder that if you're interested in anarchist theory but are new to the thought or have questions that are general, r/anarchy101 is a useful resource that may be better suited to them.

Instead they have managers appointed to deal with very specific tasks by the larger body thorugh direct democracy and their authority can be removed/replaced at any time by participating members. Important subjects like expansion of the firm would still be left to all members through the direct vote and instead the managers would tend to more sophisticated matters like interactions with trade nodes.

But here is what wikipedia says he offers an understanding of property rights as contingent but tightly constrained social strategies\u2014reflective of the importance of multiple, overlapping rationales for separate ownership and of natural law principles of practical reasonableness, defending robust but non-absolute protections for these rights in a manner similar to that employed by David Hume.[17] This account is distinguished both from Lockean and neo-Lockean views which deduce property rights from the idea of self-ownership and from consequentialist accounts that might license widespread ad hoc interference with the possessions of groups and individuals.[18] Chartier uses this account to ground a clear statement of the natural law basis for the view that solidaristic wealth redistribution by individual persons is often morally required, but as a response by individuals and grass-roots networks to particular circumstances rather than as a state-driven attempt to achieve a particular distributive pattern.[19] He advances detailed arguments for workplace democracy rooted in such natural law principles as subsidiarity,[20] defending it as morally desirable and as a likely outcome of the elimination of injustice rather than as something to be mandated by the state.[21] He discusses natural law approaches to land reform and to the occupation of factories by workers.[22] He objects on natural-law grounds to intellectual property protections, drawing on his theory of property rights more generally.[23] And he develops a general natural law account of boycotts.[24]\"\n","created_utc":1520103007,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"soccerskyman","body":"&gt;Devil's advocate here. If Jeff Bezos wants to spend his money to help others, good for him. If not, why support his company? Why not just buy locally?\n\nIt's not just Jeff Bezos, its capitalism. *All* consumption under capitalism is unethical.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, for argument's sake, if he truly doesn't do all the work at his company (obviously) or perhaps work the hardest, why doesn't anyone within the company just branch out and compete with Amazon? Nothing is stopping anyone from starting up where he did and making it on their own. Sure, there was luck involved, but you cannot capitalize on that luck (no pun intended) unless you have the skills and preparedness necessary to jump at the opportunity when it presents itself.\n\nStarting a business isn't a simple process that anyone can do. You need money, time, and connections just to even entertain the idea.  If you, for example, wanted to start a supermarket in a town, you would need to be able to front all the start-up costs out of pocket or by loan, and likely operate at a loss for a while before you eventually make it. Then you need to compete with corporate giants with infinitely more resources, legal protection, and infrastructure than you.\n\nContinuing with the town supermarket example, let's say Walmart comes around and decides to open up in town. You, unable to compete with their prices, and the rest of local business owners go to the city government for help. Let's say that they agree to prohibit Walmart opening up in their town, despite Walmart's handsome \"donations\". Well, Walmart decides to just open up a store just outside the cities jurisdiction instead! Now let's say you somehow manage to swing public opinion in your favor and convince the city's citizens to buy local whenever possible. Walmart then just drops prices to such a low level, they actually lose money from it, just to steal those customers back. They have the money, they can tank some losses for a few years. You, however? You can't. You're forced to close down and accept defeat.\n\nThis economic domination happens *all the time*. You can't avoid it. Capitalism is a system that rewards the most ruthless and brutal of business practices.\n\n&gt;I would argue that most people would jump at the chance to make more money to have something to show for their diligence. I think he has far too much, but I also think time will tell. Amazon is still growing. Perhaps Jeff will pull a Bill Gates somewhere soon. Perhaps he will pull an Elon Musk. Perhaps in the long run, all that money will benefit humanity.\n\nYou don't climb the social ladder and become rich; you either are born into it or are extremely lucky and beat insurmountable odds against you. They just tell you that you can to keep you complicit with your oppression, thinking \"One day, I'll *own* the boot that's crushing me\". Let me be clear with you: If you aren't rich already, you will never, ever, be rich. If you are poor, you will, almost certainly, die poor. You aren't the next \"Bill Gates\" (or whatever superhuman cult of personality you put around the old shit), you are destined to fill a grave and rot away with time just like everyone else around you. Modern neo-liberal capitalism is so intricate, so alienated, so bureaucratic, and so abstract, that where you place in the economic structure isn't really under your control. Jeff Bezos isn't a genius, he was just born with the resources to play the system. He exploited the most efficiently and had a bit of luck. He's not a hero, he's a scum bag that's comfortable with giving those beneath him slave wages and violating the most basic of workers rights.\n\n&gt;I would argue that it is far better in the hands of a forward thinker than the clutches of a shady government.\n\nGovernments and business are nearly identical in effect. They are systems that put self-preservation above all else. [They sometimes even collaborate and orchestrate the most atrocious crimes against humanity the world has ever seen.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemalan_genocide)\n\n&gt;I think Amazon is pushing us to new levels of convenience. I could literally shop from home or work while performing mindless tasks rather than go out of my way to shop. And even if I do shop at an Amazon store, I can grab and go without waiting in line. I could imagine a future where we benefit even more.\n\nYour convenience comes at a cost of exploitation. Being able to shop in your underwear isn't more important than people being able to eat. You privilege rests on the back of slaves.\n\n&gt;I want everyone to have fair and equal treatment, but I do think there will always be imbalances in the quest for progress. If we had no incentives to do better, we might not want to. Case in point, my boss lied to me about earning commission for web orders. I chose to not work on the site as much as I would have liked to. It is now failing. Without the reward, there is no reason for anyone to pursue anything.\n\nCapitalism is what alienates you from your work in the first place. Work isn't only done for profit, some people do things because they actually *enjoy* doing them. Not to mention, there are whole industries that capitalism makes us waste our time and labor on (advertising industries, banking, insurance, lots of management, brokerage, government positions, etc). There is no way in 2018 that everyone needs to work 8 hours a day to keep things running when we were able to back in the early 1900's.\n\nIt sounds like you would really benefit from a visit to /r/Anarchy101 so you can learn the basics of anarchist theory.\n\nEDIT: changed link to something more specific","created_utc":1520111213,"score":4,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"PrestonTheTroll","body":"I totally agree with you but I think this video wasn't looking at the whole picture and singled out a business and its CEO using some stretched examples. I think the issue at hand is very complicated. And using Amazon as the example, Jeff Bezos benefited from people buying shit on his site. Those customers (including the guy in the video) gave their money to Amazon knowing there are hungry people out there. In a truly altruistic society where we want to eliminate hunger, this guy his buying DVDs when we both know he should pirate them. Then take the money he saved and buy a burger for a kid in Africa. Instead, he makes a video whining about it, and reaps the rewards from advertising on his channel. \n\n\nFurthermore, Jeff Bezos isn't taking from those who are starving. He is profiting from those who choose to buy shit over helping others. Sure, he could donate his billions and still be rich (and he should) but maybe he has other plans for the money. I just think its funny that people like to point fingers blaming those that profit from their ideas rather than looking at themselves. We could all be a little more helpful in this world to others. And before you argue that I don't understand Anarchism or shouldn't be here, I have been to Africa, helped with what I could, and used some money to help out those in need. I doubt this YouTuber has.\n\n&gt;Let me be clear with you: If you aren't rich already, you will never, ever, be rich. If you are poor, you will, almost certainly, die poor. You aren't the next \"Bill Gates\" (or whatever superhuman cult of personality you put around the old shit), you are destined to fill a grave and rot away with time just like everyone else around you. Modern neo-liberal capitalism is so intricate, so alienated, so bureaucratic, and so abstract, that where you place in the economic structure isn't really under your control. Jeff Bezos isn't a genius, he was just born with the resources to play the system. He exploited the most efficiently and had a bit of luck. He's not a hero, he's a scum bag that's comfortable with giving those beneath him slave wages and violating the most basic of workers rights.\n\nI have no respect really for Jeff Bezos. Then again I don't care. But I do disagree. My good friend was born and raised in this ghetto in Newark, NJ. He was poor as shit. And literally was the product of slaves as he can trace his roots to plantations in the south. He busted his ass and broke through to start a contracting business in central NJ. He now has a really nice house (nicer than mine) and an amazing family. He is putting his kids through school, goes away yearly, and proved you can do it if you bust your ass. True, many will fail, but it is possible. Same goes for my dad. He came from nothing and now has a successful medical supply business. He gave us his all and we did benefit growing up, but I need to work 100x harder and have less than he did at his age. Life is what you make it.\n\n&gt;Capitalism is what alienates you from your work in the first place.\n \nI think capitalism is definitely broken, but I think there's a lot of complex things that need to be ironed out. Not everything is as black and white as you paint it. I hate the \"business end\" of what I do, but I gotta pay the bills until we figure out a new economy.

{"author":"Womar23","body":"&gt;We have referred elsewhere to the surplus population as the extreme embodiment of capital\u2019s contradictory dynamic. What is the relationship between the surplus population and the lumpen-proletariat? Are they one and the same? Whereas Marx expounds on the surplus population, at length, in Capital, he does not refer to the lumpen-proletariat at all in that work; he uses the phrase only in his political writings. How did the \u201clumpen\u201d become such a popular topic, among revolutionaries, in the course of the twentieth century?\n\n&gt;As it turns out, \u201clumpen proletariat\u201d was a key category for the workers\u2019 movement, and particularly for Marxists, in their Social Democratic and Bolshevik variants. Marxists were always hurling curses at perceived lumpen proletarians and anarchists alike, so much so that the two categories blended together. According to Rosa Luxemburg in The Mass Strike, \u201cAnarchism has become in the [1905] Russian Revolution, not the theory of the struggling proletariat, but the ideological signboard of the counterrevolutionary lumpenproletariat, who, like a school of sharks, swarm in the wake of the battleship of the revolution.\u201d\n\n&gt;Who were these lumpen proletarians, preaching anarchy? Attempts to spell that out usually took the form not of structural analyses, but rather, of long lists of shady characters, lists which collapsed in on themselves in a frenzied incoherence. Here is Marx\u2019s paradigmatic discussion of the lumpen proletariat, from The 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte: \u201cOn the pretext of founding a benevolent society, the lumpen proletariat of Paris had been organised into secret sections, each section led by Bonapartist agents\u201d. These lumpens supposedly consisted of \u201cvagabonds, discharged soldiers and jailbirds, escaped galley slaves, swindlers, mountebanks, lazzaroni, pickpockets, tricksters, gamblers, pimps, brothel keepers, porters, literati, organ grinders, ragpickers, knife grinders, tinkers, beggars\u2009\u2014\u2009in short, the whole indefinite, disintegrated mass, thrown hither and thither, which the French call la boh\u00e8me.\u201d Is there any truth in this paranoid fantasy? Do escaped convicts and organ grinders share a common, counter-revolutionary interest with beggars, which distinguishes them from the common mass of workers, who are apparently revolutionary by nature? To think so is insane.\n\n&gt;The lumpen proletariat was a spectre, haunting the workers\u2019 movement. If that movement constituted itself as the movement for the dignity of workers, then the lumpen was the figure of the undignified worker (or more accurately, the lumpen was one of its figurations). All of the movement\u2019s efforts to give dignity to the class were supposedly undermined by these dissolute figures: drunks singing in the street, petty criminals and prostitutes. References to the lumpen proletariat registered what was a simple truth: it was difficult to convince workers to organise as workers, since mostly, they didn\u2019t care about socialism: \u201ca great many of the poor, and especially the very poor, did not think of themselves or behave as \u2018proletarians,\u2019 or find the organisations and modes of action of the movement as applicable or relevant to them.\u201d In their free time, they\u2019d rather go to the pub than sing workers\u2019 songs.\n\n&gt;In the figure of the lumpen, we discover the dark underside of the affirmation of the working class. It was an abiding class-hatred. Workers saw themselves as originating out of a stinking morass: \u201cAt the time of the beginning of modern industry the term proletariat implied absolute degeneracy. And there are persons who believe this is still the case.\u201d Moreover, capitalism was trying to push workers back into the muck. Thus, the crisis tendencies of capitalism could only end in one of two ways: in the victory of the working class or in its becoming lumpen.\n\nFrom *The Construction of the Workers Movement, Endnotes 4*","created_utc":1520122791,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Here is a nice quote from it (emphasis mine):\n\n&gt; Jared Diamond notwithstanding, there is absolutely no evidence that top-down structures of rule are the necessary consequence of large-scale organization. Walter Scheidel notwithstanding, **it is simply not true that ruling classes, once established, cannot be gotten rid of except by general catastrophe**. To take just one well-documented example: around 200 AD, the city of **Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico**, with a population of 120,000 (one of the largest in the world at the time), **appears to have undergone a profound transformation, turning its back on pyramid-temples and human sacrifice, and reconstructing itself as a vast collection of comfortable villas, all almost exactly the same size**. It remained so for perhaps 400 years. Even in Cort\u00e9s\u2019 day, **Central Mexico was still home to cities like Tlaxcala, run by an elected council whose members were periodically whipped by their constituents to remind them who was ultimately in charge**.\n\nThough I dislike the violence involved, I find the idea to periodically and strongly remember appointed administrators who it is they serve to be excellent.\n\nThe article's conclusion is just as interesting:\n\n&gt; Once the historical verdict is in, we will see that the most painful loss of human freedoms began at the small scale \u2013 the level of gender relations, age groups, and domestic servitude \u2013 the kind of relationships that contain at once the greatest intimacy and the deepest forms of structural violence. If we really want to understand how it first became acceptable for some to turn wealth into power, and for others to end up being told their needs and lives don\u2019t count, it is here that we should look.

How is it that Somalia is so messed up when every Somali person I've ever met (and that's not a small number) has been totally nice and decent? I really don't understand it.\n\nToo many issues to jot down here but, to put it simply, the place basically went through a terrible civil war and has been suffering through its repercussions ever since. Think Iraq but without an invasion. That being said, large swathes of the *country* are pretty quiet and uneventful like where I'm from in the northeast, I'd say it's mainly the capital and some areas along the south surrounding it that suffer through issues like al-Shabab bombings whilst the rest of the country is mostly (**not entirely,** there is a lot of idiotic clanism amok in the other regions too which gets in the way) just held back by the corruption in the capital which stifles *development* severely but it's limping on nevertheless.\n\nEither way, I honestly kind of like how Somalia is, as odd as that sounds. Especially areas like where I'm from... Not many or really any large multinationals with a strong footing in the local markets, the local state government is rather weak, there's lots of wide open land and *underdeveloped* towns... It's land quite ripe for shaping into whatever you can imagine if you have the drive, resources and wits required to do so. I'd possibly be more depressed if the civil war had never happened and we'd kept developing under a dictatorship and today became some highly *developed* police state with strong ties to Western powers whilst the locals have been brainwashed into accepting Capitalism as the only way forward. \n\nBut as it is now, I can go back home (I was born and raised in the Persian Gulf region) and use my family's wealth to start opening schools that don't run on a [Prussian inspired model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzmvtVAuuyI) (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzmvtVAuuyI) and [here),](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhUx1pArrO4) help locals start Co-ops, disseminate ideas about organizing the local low level politics in a more horizontal manner. I'm not going to go overtly Communist or Anarchist lest I want to get CIA-ed (rofl) but yeah, it's far riper for \"saving\", in my humble opinion, than the Capitalist hell-hole I was born and raised in here in the Gulf where I think only some miraculous regional revolution could make any meaningful difference.","created_utc":1520175982,"score":5,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

In fact, teachers often let themselves be grossly exploited because they know they are one of the vital parts of the support system for their students--even if it's not explicitly in the job description.  In addition to the subject they're expected to teach (the hours of classroom time, the hours off campus doing grading and curriculum development, etc...), teachers also have to be informal (and untrained) counselors, parents, managers, mentors, protectors, and advocates for their students.  They have to battle resentful parents, inform ignorant parents, deal with administration, and cope with stupid standardized test requirements that actually undermine the learning experience.  Throughout all of this, they still need to run a functional classroom, often underfunded and over-capacity.  They regularly overextend themselves and use their own resources to outfit and improve their classrooms... and, hence the environment for the students.\n\n\nIn contrast to law enforcement, nobody ever became a teacher because they wanted a power rush.  They become teachers because they want to make people stronger and help them grow.  \n\nTeachers habitually, compulsively even, sacrifice themselves and open themselves to exploitation simply as part of their regular day.  The problem is that they are expected to do this and criticized if they aren't willing to be completely martyred--accused of, \"not caring enough for their students\".

I'm in your position too, yet my relationship with my SO is completely horizontal and explicitly devoid of assuming gender roles in most, if not all, situations.\n\nThe whole *premise* of dom/sub and other sexual preferences are that they're completely exclusive from your personal life. It's not *real*, and its purpose is to make the whole act of sex more enjoyable for both partners.\n\nI would argue that the *fun* in these situations isn't the fact I have control over my partner, but that by assuming these roles I can make my partner's experience more enjoyable, and my partner can make it more enjoyable for me -- Is that not closer to mutual aid? I'm not trying to use control for selfish gain, hell it might as well be the opposite!\n\nSo yeah, there's my little rant on dom/sub shit.\n\n***\n\nThese parasites aren't in it to make their partner enjoy sex more, but are so toxic and vile that they cannot find partners for consenting sex, and must resort to raping destitute women in order to get any form of sexual gratification whatsoever. It's purely selfish, and only expected to happen in a capitalist system at some point.\n\nLet's be clear here, any case where a woman only consents to sex in order to avoid financial desitution (starvation, homelessness/eviction, etc.) is being raped. Their consent is not one of \"desire\" or wish to have sex with the person \"paying\", but to avoid a lower standard of living, coercing them to accept sexual favours.\n\nBy this logic (as I expect criticism), I suppose prostitution is also rape, but that's because many who go into prostitution/sex work do so for monetary reasons, and thus have been *economically coerced* into consenting to sex with \"customers\".\n\n Prostitution and sex work may exist in a post-capitalist society, even a post-scarcity one, but those property relations are different, and in those cases the reasons for going into sex work may involve sexual enjoyment from doing so. \n\nIn capitalist societies, there are definitely people who agree to the line of work purely because they like the premise, and payment part is a \"bonus\". They're still exploited sexually, of course, if they're \"pimped\" or must pay money to other parties for taking part in their work, as goes for bosses who exploit the labour of their employees.\n\n\n\n\n","created_utc":1520263518,"score":4,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

They kept everyone blocked in for about 6 hours before they swooped in and mass arrested eveyone. Be aware of the kettle and make a point to shout out to the rest of your crew if you think the police are pushing you towards a kettle.\"\n\nBe careful about spreading rumors in cases like these, sometimes people are just on edge and the cops are just happening to be a bit close at a specific juncture. It's good to be alert, because then you can possibly break out of the kettle if you're fast and can seize the initiative but it all depends on the geography of the location.\n\n\"Breaking zip ties.

Do this enough times and the plastic will start to heat up at the center where the ends connect and will snap eventually.\" \n\nYou can also do this with lighters, small nail files, etc. Some people I knew used to have some taped to the inside of their belts to fish out if they were in ziplock ties to burn or saw off the zip ties.","created_utc":1520265444,"score":25,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

This, in my view, is the only viable option for revolutionaries in the modern day, due to, as you mention in your post, the advanced weaponry held by the state. \n\nThe PYD was formed in the early 2000\u2019s, and quickly began organizing protests which cause the states of Syria, Turkey, and even the KRG to crack down on them (interestingly enough, the PKK also had a faction that opposed the creation of the PYD). This caused them to organize underground. Leading up to the Syrian Civil War, they began to organize illegal civilian councils in the neighborhoods of towns throughout Rojava, which led to the beginnings of direct democratic structures as well as the YPG (at first it was the YXG) to help protect them during the unclear future ahead of them, as they did not want to side with the FSA or Assad. \n\nIn my view, this only helps reinforce my belief in the dual power strategy, as, like I said, it\u2019s the only viable strategy left in a world where states have nuclear arsenals and laser guided missiles. That\u2019s not to say steps should be taken to form armed groups whose purpose is to protect the community from hostile outside forces, as those steps are necessary for the survival of these people\u2019s democracies. \n\nHope this helps :) If you have any more questions about communalism, just hit up r/Communalists","created_utc":1520267632,"score":5,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

If you absolutely can't leave the area but are being pursued, lose the tail as best as you can, hop down in the subway, and come back out through a different exit.

Do you really expect this cop to actually disarm his friends, when his whole life and career he's understood that the firearm is the ultimate means to self defense? Hell no. Now take that exact same cop and drop him in the projects of his city. He's been brainwashed and constantly told that the people of that community are evil thugs hell bent on the destruction of all forms of civilized society through gangs and drug trafficking. So this cop no longer views firearms as a means of self defense for these people, but as a way for them to do crime and threaten his way of life.

{"author":"lookedafter","body":"I appreciate your comments Brendan, I am from the area as well. I think you're right that as folks engaged with anarchist theory, we should have an easier time seeing this action as part of a broader strategy. \n\nIt seems as if this action has backfired when it justifies further police action against the anarchist community in Hamilton, and reinforces support for those actions. On social media and in the news I see folks coming out in support of the business owners and decrying \"senseless violence\" etc. This coming both from older people who own property, but also from my peers who live in precarious housing situations but might not have the critical resources to question that precarity.\n\nIt seems to me that the action was counterproductive for the reasons you've stated in your comments: legitimizing fascist gaslighting and police violence, as well as alienating people who might be brought to understand the contradictions of gentrification and how it damages them.\n\nI read the document posted by u/fuckyourcountry above, which is a good analysis of the historical realities of gentrification in Hamilton. A few things stood out to me.\n\nFirst, the authors wrote, \"A bare minimum ask we might make of people moving here (and of ourselves too) is to refuse to become the political base for developers and for gentrification\u2019s boosters. The wave of people moving here, primarily from Toronto, has combined with the existing artsy, urban progressive space to produce a pro-development population in the core. Many people who move here get swept up in this \u2013 they\u2019re paying twice the rent of the previous tenant or paying a hundred thousand dollars more than a house was worth a year earlier, joining on calls to clean up the neighbourhood, calling the cops on their neighbours rather than getting to know them.\n\nSome ways to begin refusing this are to learn the histories of the neighbourhoods you\u2019re moving to, to connect with your neighbours and build relationships, to enter slowly, understand the various interests competing in the downtown and pick sides consciously. But reducing the issue of gentrification to one of personal conscience is pretty obviously insufficient.\n\nAlthough it falls far short of an organized response to development, forming relationships and discussing the issues that face us is crucial for developing an understanding of the specifics of the situation we\u2019re confronting. In this moment, where gentrification is undeniable, we need to push back against all the false solutions to it we are offered.\"\n\nIt seems as if the actions on Locke St. are not an attempt to build relationships with folks who are new to the community and prevent them from solidifying into the political base for developers and gentrification's boosters. I found it pretty unsettling that one of the so-called messages of love written on the boards outside the donut store or whatever was \"get rid of the anarchist bookstore, there's no place for them in cultured communities.\" Surely this is not the response that those who oppose gentrification in Hamilton want to provoke. \n\nOn the other hand, in the Gentrification in Hamilton 2015 document, the authors say that a purely negative approach to gentrification helps to bring fault lines to the surface, and that the most effective tactics drive open fissures and force belligerent responses from social entrepreneurs. \n\nDo you guys think it is worthwhile to have to defend these sorts of actions when it could be detrimental to building relationships with folks who are in precarious housing situations but might not have the critical resources to confront those conditions in a serious way / might be identified with the arts scene or whatever? If it isn't worthwhile, as u/sirbrendanthebold is saying, how do you plan on avoiding 'punching left' in this instance when it inevitably comes up with others who aren't engaged with anarchist theory or praxis?","created_utc":1520281548,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"SirBrendantheBold","body":"Advocacy groups, outreach programs, prefigurative politics, labour movements and unionization, direct action, information campaigns, and general protests are currently the best tools we've got. This is an exciting/bleak time in that the majority of the developed world are losing faith in the capitalist market system. \n\nThis was always inevitable considering incremental efficiency gain and the need for capitalism to eternally develop to sustain itself. It started (in the West) in the late 70's with the end of the labour shortage but it is beginning to crystallize itself to a point that even moderates aren't pretending this is working. What isn't inevitable is the way society transitions through the terminal point. Capitalism is an incredibly resilient and adaptive system, which means it can strangle the workers and international market to sustain itself for quite some time (with slowly but always reducing real wages). Fascism is a terrifyingly real alternative market arrangement, combining capitalist adaptability with strong statist intervention and provision.\n\nWe need a combination of prefigurative politics with direct praxis. This is excellent in that it allows for divisions in devotion that doesn't exclude uncertain or moderate allies from participating. We must focus on what is required for anarchist society to flourish by targeting key struggles in the way we think.  Help them understand that something as simple as advocating for queer and trans rights help out the anarchist movement in a meaningful way. Help them understand that advocating for labour movements normalizes unions and helps to dispel the false narrative that they harm productivity and job availability. We have to start shifting the conversation away from the false dichotomies and back into earnest dialogue. Attack the distraction of the media, the state, the capitalist apologia; even if they imagine anarchism is difficult to achieve they must be convinced that the closer to it we get the better off we are. Have them use it as an anchoring ideal-- abandon compromise. \n\nWhich leaves for the most adamant or concrete comrade the task of direct action and organization. As the aforementioned programs, paired with sympathetic moderates, rework the discussion we'll find more and more member joining into the more radical beliefs and networks. Fatalism is the enemy. There are many steps between now and then but the road is clear if you're convinced we need to walk it. ","created_utc":1520281782,"score":12,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"jphuffinstuff","body":"It really depends on context. for example, the appropriation of the term \"nigger\" by black people into \"nigga\" based on urban accents is a great example of context. If a black person calls someone their \"nigga\" that is different from Michael Richards outright calling people \"niggers\" to dehumanize and demean them, in that the appropriation of the term \"nigger\" by black people is in a way diluting the potency of the term. The same can be seen by the term \"queer\", which used to be a slur for people of non-heterosexual orientations, but now is a legitimate sexual orientation. On satire, though, I think is where things get complicated; the use of the term \"nigger\" in the movie blazing saddles wasn't racist in my opinion, in that there was a black actor who was completely fine with it, and it was used exclusively to mock the outright racism of american history. The same can be seen in the song \"Holiday in Cambodia\" by the Dead Kennedys, a song mocking so-called \"champagne socialists\", or what we now know as the American liberal, which features the line \n\n\"Braggin' that you know\nHow the niggers feel cold\nAnd the slum's got so much soul\"\n\nThis line mocks the American liberal by showing that all they care about is seeming like they care, a facade of sympathy, simply to feel morally comfortable. Once again, this is not racist (in my opinion) since they are using the term exclusively to mock people, and since the Dead Kennedys are clearly not racist. When it becomes a problem, however, is when it's used by edgy white teenage boys who think they're so cool because they use racial slurs, acting like they're the new south park or something. The difference between some edgy teenager screeching on about 9/11 or some other edgy bullshit and south park is that south park mocks people by using these offensive subjects and terms, and that edgy teenagers use these terms only because no one else will. It's like some sort of \"forbidden fruit\" to them that makes them feel powerful knowing they're the only people stupid enough to use the term. So in short, what I'm saying is that context matters, a lot. But a lot of it is purely subjective, too.

{"author":"SirBrendantheBold","body":"Before you ever start talking about the detritus of of union corruption, you've to appreciate just how much right-wing and 'pro-business' propaganda has been used to malign unions. Think-tanks are a thing and they are very effective.\n\nDiscussing unions in a single nation is flawed. There are legal, cultural, and historical elements that act as 'confounding variables'. Which means that corruption or abuse in a union is not indicative of corruption and abuse being endemic to unions; it doesn't even mean that such a problem is intrinsic to unions in the same country. Mafia taking over a particular union is an indictment of organized crime and that particular union, not unions in general. \n\nSo instead of focussing narrowly on nations with harsh anti-labour laws and a very weak unionization rate, like the US (around 20%), it is much more worthwhile to look at heavily unionized nations like Denmark and Japan (around 80%). Rather than finding the alleged abundance of corruption and drops in efficiency and productivity rates, we instead find the inverse to be true: they've better metrics on all measurable fronts. They also tend, naturally, towards more horizontal business hierarchies and feelings of workers being included and invested in the company.\n\nKeep in mind that the success of the Spanish Anarchist movement was predicated in general striking from organized unions that managed to actually take over control of the businesses and firms that had employed them. Even more remarkable, their market efficiency and GDP actually increased, in the middle of a civil war, while the rest of Europe were suffering far more lethargic growth or even contraction. This dispels entirely and conclusively the argument that unions are 'bad for business'. It also demonstrates the important of organised labour for anyone seeking a revolutionary shift in their society.\n\nBut to direct corruption, speaking as a sociologist now, it's incredibly difficult to measure. Which is why the allegation keeps reappearing: it's an opinion that is impossible to falsify. There will be instances of criminal behaviour in any capitalist organisation, business or union. There will be instances of union leaders, like business leaders, selling out the workers or organisation for personal gains. There will be corrupting or colluding influences. So how many arrests or fines or malfeasance is necessary to say that unions are corrupt; and if we do apply such a standard, why is not the same standard used to say private capital is corrupt? \n\nThe reality is that unions are far more democratic than any private organisation is and provides real levers for redress. They are also far more monitored and regimented in legal barriers against corrupt practices which will simultaneously provide disproportionate examples of corruption while ironically making them less corrupt. \n\nI am by no means saying unions are impervious to the influence of capitalism. They however represent, outside violent revolution, the single most effective means of organising for workers rights and interests. They must be championed by everyone on the left.","created_utc":1520289012,"score":7,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

That it doesn't usually entail dismantling capitalism is a reflection of the fact that people who join Effective Altruism usually don't favor dismantling capitalism. This is not surprising since most *people* aren't in favor of dismantling capitalism, and many of the remainder nevertheless believe that dismantling capitalism is still not the *best* thing to be doing with one's time and money.

{"author":"iheartennui","body":"Seen this quote posted here a couple times before so I'll take my turn to post it now. In response to someone asking what an anarchist society would look like, or to name some successful examples:\n\n&gt; The dice are loaded. You can\u2019t win. Because when the skeptic says \u201csociety,\u201d what he really means is \u201cstate,\u201d even \u201cnation-state.\u201d Since no one is going to produce an example of an anarchist state\u2014that would be a contradiction in terms\u2014what we\u201fre really being asked for is an example of a modern nation-state with the government somehow plucked away: a situation in which the government of Canada, to take a random example, has been overthrown, or for some reason abolished itself, and no new one has taken its place but instead all former Canadian citizens begin to organize themselves into libertarian collectives. Obviously this would never be allowed to happen. In the past, whenever it even looked like it might\u2014here, the Paris commune and Spanish civil war are excellent examples\u2014the politicians running pretty much every state in the vicinity have been willing to put their differences on hold until those trying to bring such a situation about had been rounded up and shot.\n\n&gt; There is a way out, which is to accept that anarchist forms of organization would not look anything like a state. That they would involve an endless variety of communities, associations, networks, projects, on every conceivable scale, overlapping and intersecting in any way we could imagine, and possibly many that we can\u2019t. Some would be quite local, others global. Perhaps all they would have in common is that none would involve anyone showing up with weapons and telling everyone else to shut up and do what they were told. And that, since anarchists are not actually trying to seize power within any national territory, the process of one system replacing the other will not take the form of some sudden revolutionary cataclysm\u2014the storming of a Bastille, the seizing of a Winter Palace\u2014but will necessarily be gradual, the creation of alternative forms of organization on a world scale, new forms of communication, new, less alienated ways of organizing life, which will, eventually, make currently existing forms of power seem stupid and beside the point. That in turn would mean that there are endless examples of viable anarchism: pretty much any form of organization would count as one, so long as it was not imposed by some higher authority, from a klezmer band to the international postal service.\n\n-David Graeber\n\nBasically, anarchism can exist now and it does. Any relationship you have with someone that is not enforced by some institutional hierarchy can be seen as existing anarchism. There are many spheres of life in which people operate in this way and it is perfectly natural to them - e.g. peoples' natural tendency to mutual aid in times of disaster is an obvious one, but simple things like having friends over for dinner, neighbourhood groups, hobby/sports clubs, etc. and then there are more intentional projects like free libraries, activist organising, etc. - we just need to believe that it could be like this for every other part of life too.","created_utc":1520294209,"score":4,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

If not, I'll outline her basic criticism. \n\nOne of the fundamental criticisms of the effective altruism movement is that a moral saint, someone who bends all of their time, money and action in order to benefit the \"greater good\" either because it makes them feel better, or out of a sense of duty is someone who has sacrificed so much of their own personal time and effort that they cannot function as a normal human being anymore.\n\n If we take the logic of effective altruism and run with it, we encourage people to live unfulfilling lives with zero meaning outside of our relationship to other people's material well being. Of course, this is rarely the case, but it's only because followers of effective altruism are rarely as altruistic as a thought experiment would be. But the underlying ideology is there, and it effects how people engage with each other and live out their lives creating change or making a difference. \n\nWhich leads me to my next next criticism. Namely this\n\n&gt;dismantling capitalism is still not the best thing to be doing with one's time and money. \n\nSure. Let's put aside capitalism and just take it as a given. Instead let's unpack what this tiny sentence means. \n\nThis illustrates a fundamental idea of EA. Do the most good with your time and money. Great. That makes sense intuitively. The problem is EA's definition of good, which makes the implementation of EA and that fundamental idea problematic. In that framework, vital and necessary organizations that service populations that need help should be ignored in favor of organizations that can have a greater \"impact\" in terms of lives saved or people helped. It's easier, and has a greater \"impact\", if you support starving children in the third world rather than prison abolitionist movements in the West. Your money is more effective supporting well digging projects in Bangladesh for clean water rather than supporting efforts for legal representation of Bangladeshi laborers in Malaysia. etc. etc. \n\nHell, several EA websites and orgs say that disaster relief is basically useless and should be ignored. \n\nThese type of callous and impartial judgments are the types of things that alienate people from working with and improving their local communities. Furthermore, for an anarchist, this type of logic and prioritization leads to a creation of a hierarchy, as it becomes clearer and clearer that the more \"efficient\" methods in this system require experts in data analysis who organize and tell people where and how to spend their money. It's an undesirable ordering of society. \n\n","created_utc":1520296509,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"UmamiTofu","body":"&gt;I'm not missing something, I'm sure you're familiar with Susan Wolf and her idea of moral saints. \n\nFirst, I'm not aware of anyone in EA who matches the description in Wolf's paper. It's not really psychologically possible to be a perfect moral saint. Even if it were, it is already preempted by Singer's point that behaving that way doesn't really have good long-run consequences.\n\nSecond, Wolf's criticism should not be understood as an attack on any particular moral theory, such as utilitarianism or effective altruism. It is an attack on the idea of morality being encompassing all of one's motivation. You could easily be a utilitarian who just doesn't stick with morality all the time, and you could be a Kantian or pluralist or anyone else who is so focused on morality that they are to be considered a moral saint. She is pretty explicit about this in her paper.\n\nThird, it's simply false that a moral saint cannot function as a human being. That is an overstatement of Wolf's position. \n\n&gt;If we take the logic of effective altruism and run with it, we encourage people to live unfulfilling lives with zero meaning outside of our relationship to other people's material well being\n\nNo, the logic of effective altruism says to improve global well-being. It's not limited to \"material\" well-being and nowhere does it imply that people should live unfulfilling lives. Maybe you believe that life can't be fulfilling if you're not spending lots of money on yourself, or something, but that doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\n&gt;The problem is EA's definition of good, \n\nActually we don't have a single consistent definition of good. Normally it is \"well-being among sentient beings\"; is there something wrong with that?\n\n&gt;In that framework, vital and necessary organizations that service populations that need help should be ignored in favor of organizations that can have a greater \"impact\" in terms of lives saved or people helped\n\nIf it's \"vital and necessary\" then presumably it shouldn't be ignored, per the tenets of Effective Altruism. Things that are \"vital and necessary\" are things that have a great positive impact upon the world.\n\n&gt;It's easier, and has a greater \"impact\", if you support starving children in the third world rather than prison abolitionist movements in the West\n\nYes, and supporting starving children in the third world is more vital and necessary than prison abolition movements. This is because it improves more people's lives.\n\n&gt;These type of callous and impartial judgments are the types of things that alienate people from working with and improving their local communities\n\nBut the point is that working with local communities is not \"vital and necessary\", so to assert that it's a problem that EA discourages people from working with their local communities is to blatantly beg the question.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, for an anarchist, this type of logic and prioritization leads to a creation of a hierarchy, as it becomes clearer and clearer that the more \"efficient\" methods in this system require experts in data analysis who organize and tell people where and how to spend their money\n\nI don't see how that involves any more hierarchy than a subreddit with moderators who enforce the rules, or having experts in philosophy like Susan Wolf who organize and tell people about philosophy, or local community efforts which require experts regarding the local community to direct other people's efforts.","created_utc":1520298434,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

This is alienating. The utilitarian form of EA that you're arguing for creates people who see their work, in this case their altruism, stripped from a personal anchor that can give it meaning beyond the simple act of charity. It makes us ignore real problems that are \"less serious\" because they don't affect human lives as much as whatever issue GiveWell is advocating today. It estranges us from our local community, and prevents us from creating the bonds necessary for deep interpersonal relationships because our efforts are focused towards faceless organizations that provide benefits somewhere else.

Prison abolition was mentioned in the context of human dignity as a value that should be advanced and fought for as much as human life should be fought for, because human beings deserve respect as free, rational beings. I take this for granted, as Kant took it for granted. Respect for humanity is given because human beings should be treated as an end in and of themselves, rather than just a means to an end.

{"author":"UmamiTofu","body":"&gt;\"good\" should not be defined as a simple \"lives saved\" mechanism \n\nYou might want to start by having a better idea of what we actually do. We don't define good that way. If we did, then we would not be supporting charities that don't save lives. For instance, SCI has long been one of Givewell's top charities, and it barely saves any lives at all since schistosomiasis is not a life-threatening disease (in most cases).\n\n&gt;This is alienating. The utilitarian form of EA that you're arguing for creates people who see their work, in this case their altruism, stripped from a personal anchor that can give it meaning beyond the simple act of charity. \n\nI find that my work is very meaningful. I don't see why charity would be less meaningful just because we are selecting it in terms of its value on a global scale. In any case, to worry about the meaningfulness of the lives of wealthy Westerners seems to be kind of the wrong prism for evaluating charity work.\n\n&gt;It makes us ignore real problems that are \"less serious\" because they don't affect human lives as much as whatever issue GiveWell is advocating today.\n\nUnless you've found a solution to the phenomenon of economic scarcity, we are always going to ignore real problems. Everyone who is not God and lacks the ability to solve every problem in the world will always be guilty of ignoring real problems (then again, so is God, but that's another issue...). The question is which ones we should ignore. Under Effective Altruism, we address the problems which would cause the most unnecessary suffering should they be ignored. And one at a time, eventually, we can work our way up through all the other problems, as the old ones are solved.\n\n&gt;It estranges us from our local community,\n\nI don't feel estranged from my local community. I don't see why doing local charity work is necessary to avoid feeling estranged. Local charity as part of the fabric of daily life is largely a recent Western phenomenon, and it certainly did not exist throughout the period in which the modern human mind evolved. But this doesn't mean that humans throughout history felt estranged from their local community.\n\n&gt;prevents us from creating the bonds necessary for deep interpersonal relationships because our efforts are focused towards faceless organizations that provide benefits somewhere else\n\nThis is simply false. To allege that people can't create deep interpersonal relationships just because they are focused on benefiting far away others makes no sense. Maybe you think that having a deep interpersonal relationship requires spending a lot of money, or sacrificing a career, or something of the sort, but lots of people in deep interpersonal relationships will tell you that that is not the case. \n\nYou should also note that an equally compelling tale can be told for theories such as Kantianism, which alienate people from the actual interests of others in favor of abstracted duties. Kantian duties are divorced from the everyday psychological and material realities of our kin; so are Aristotelian virtues. They are all abstract ideals.\n\n&gt;This is not how you build community\n\nIt's not how you build a *local* community, but again, this is just begging the question, since research indicates that building communities in the poorest regions of the world is better than building local ones (assuming of course that you mean \"local\" to be somewhere in a wealthier country).\n\n&gt;It's not a stretch to say that someone who, with a full understanding of the situation, can see suffering in front of them, and ignore it because their time, money and effort can be spent better somewhere else is somehow broken in their outlook\n\nIt's much less of a stretch to say that someone who allows a greater amount of gratuitous suffering to exist just because something else was \"in front of them\" in spite of all the solid arguments of decision theory, economics, and ethics is broken in their outlook. People who suffer don't care about how far away you are, or how \"broken\" your outlook is. They care about their suffering. \n\n&gt;Prison abolition was mentioned in the context of human dignity as a value that should be advanced and fought for as much as human life should be fought for, because human beings deserve respect as free, rational beings. \n\nIf you think there are good arguments for dignity as a terminal value, sure. But it seems to me that reductions to global poverty would improve human dignity more effectively than prison reform. Disease and poverty sap dignity just as much as prison does, and it is easier to get people out of poverty in the third world than it is to get them out of prison in the first. Of course you may come to either conclusion, but the point is to do it rigorously, with a robust framework that takes a variety of considerations into account. EAs have actually done this by the way, because not everyone in EA is utilitarian. The common thread is being serious about research, math and decision theory. \n\n&gt;Would you like me to have explained all of this, while you just get to advance a utilitarian argument without having to explain any of it? \n\nThe famous arguments for EA, such as Singer's \"drowning child\" analogy, are not based in utilitarianism. They are based on simpler, more fundamental moral premises. That suffering is pro tanto bad is almost universal in moral philosophy; that doing things effectively rather than ineffectively is rational is just a trivial statement in decision theory in order to make decisions about charity that aren't stupid.\n\n&gt;You don't get to assume that human life is the be all and end all of the greater good and sit there while I have to provide proof to the contrary. \n\nValues have nothing to do with it. You can't assume from the armchair that prison reform is the best way to ensure dignity for the most people in the world. You have to go out and do comparisons between a number of different projects. And you will have to end up ignoring some of them, because you aren't God and you can't fix everything.\n\n&gt;I have papers on papers proving that EA, as a practical, non-philosophical, movement is hypocritical and should stop propping up murderous dictators and brutal regimes\n\nHeh, please try.

The first rebuttal to prison abolition that you gave was that helping starving children improved more lives. So no, EA doesn't rely on utilitarianism, but the version of EA that you've consistently advocated for in this thread is based on some utilitarian framework. Hell, you tried to fit human dignity, a value, into a utilitarian network. Human dignity can't be quantified, and thus doesn't fit into this framework. Fighting for human dignity by fighting for prison abolition is as important as fighting for human dignity by combating disease or poverty.  Hence, the utilitarianism that *you*, as in the singular you, advance is alienating.\n\nThe estrangement and alienation from community is not an emotional one, if we're defining emotional bonds as just having friends, family and an SO. Anarchist praxis and theory is focused on mutual aid within and in between communities. People rely on the state because they've forgotten or been conditioned to believe that humans lack the capacity for cooperation and communication. EA is merely another form of this, telling people that their efforts to better their community, by organizing soup kitchens, freeing prisoners, etc. is better spent somewhere else. \n\nYou want EA to be an effective worldwide movement right? None of my arguments are built around the assumption that this is a Western perspective, only for rich Westerners. \n\n(It's ironic that this is something you go back to because EA is really only fucking feasible for rich bourgeois Westerners, and part of the goal is to earn more and more money to give more but I digress.)\n\nI'm from the Philippines, so you can drop it.

And using your methods, it would be. \n\nI'd have to turn my heart into diamond to do so. Any sort of life I live based on EA would make me a cruel person who routinely ignores what's happening in front of them because it's better for a nebulous good. That's what I mean by a estrangement and alienation from a community and the same applies to a Westerner who can sit there and think that homelessness isn't important and police brutality isn't worth fighting against or sex slavery isn't worth destroying because it's more important to do this pressing issue that GiveWell mentioned.

{"author":"UmamiTofu","body":"&gt;you have consistently defined EA through utilitarian means by defining it as maximizing the \"well being of sentient beings\" or improving global wellbeing. \n\nThat is usually what EAs support, but that does not mean that it is what EA always is or what EA has to be. Second, utilitarianism is the claim that well-being is all that matters in general. But EA is just about altruism, charity and careers. It's actually quite a bit easier to defend the idea of welfare maximization in the case of altruism than it is to defend welfare maximization in other cases (like interpersonal relationships). This is because most of the objections to utilitarianism are about cases like harming the few to save many, or other things which don't come up in the context of ordinary charitable work. But if you don't like the utilitarian kind of EA... that's fine! Pick up the dignity kind. \n\n&gt;Hell, you tried to fit human dignity, a value, into a utilitarian network. Human dignity can't be quantified, and thus doesn't fit into this framework. \n\nYou can quantify anything, the only question is whether that quantification is representing something important.\n\nYou can quantifiy the number of people in the world who have an adequate amount of dignity, and that is a meaningful figure.\n\nWhile this shares the aggregating and maximizing approach of utilitarianism, it doesn't share utilitarianism's value theory.\n\n&gt;Fighting for human dignity by fighting for prison abolition is as important as fighting for human dignity by combating disease or poverty\n\nYou are saying that in an unqualified manner. So they are always equally important? Let's look at these three statements:\n\n- abolishing all the prisons in the US is as important as preventing one case of disease\n- preventing one case of disease is as important as abolishing a single prison in the US\n- Therefore, abolishing a single prison in the US is as important as abolishing all the prisons in the US (assuming that \"as important\" is transitive, which it pretty much undeniably is)\n\nIf you deny being able to prioritize causes on the basis of quantity and impact, then you get some pretty strongly counterintuitive results. The third statement follows logically from the first two, but it is clearly false, since it implies that abolishing almost every prison in the US is not important at all.\n\n&gt;The estrangement and alienation from community is not an emotional one, if we're defining emotional bonds as just having friends, family and an SO. Anarchist praxis and theory is focused on mutual aid within and in between communities.

EA is merely another form of this, telling people that their efforts to better their community, by organizing soup kitchens, freeing prisoners, etc. is better spent somewhere else. \n\nEA is trying to get people to rely on the state? Uh, no... I don't really see what that has to do with telling people that their efforts are better spent on different things. EAs cooperate all the time; if anything it is the kind of coordination on a wide scale that would be necessary for any kind of anarchist scheme (other than a meager local commune) to make sense.\n\n&gt;EA is really only fucking feasible for rich bourgeois Westerners\n\nThere are many EAs who are not rich, and many who are not in the West. It's about what you do with whatever you have; I can't tell how you could believe this without being deliberately uncharitable.\n\n&gt;If I were to apply EA back home, it'd be more effective to let a disastrous drug war continue, to let poverty happen, to not organize and agitate, to not mobilize my community and resources to make a difference, because I could be giving to some charities with my job that I got\n\nIf you were to apply EA, there would be a lot less death from disease back in someone else's home. \n\n&gt;I'd have to turn my heart into diamond to do so\n\nThe great majority of people in the developing world aren't substantially engaged in charitable work at all (afaik). Do you think that replacing selfishness with global altruism turns your heart into diamond? Or do you think that most *people* writ large have hearts of diamond?\n\nAlso, just because something is in the same country as you are doesn't mean it's truly local in any emotional or social sense. Dunbar's Number is 150. Most of the population of the Philippines is just as unknown to you as the population of anywhere else in the world. So is the population of prison inmates in the US. And you are on a subreddit that predominantly concerns itself with grand national and international theories of economics and politics. In this context, to complain that the Against Malaria Foundation of all things is too impersonal doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\nFinally, whatever you do in the Philippines is going to ignore a lot of other things in the Philippines. If you fight the drug problems then you won't be fighting Islamism. If you fight crime then you won't be fighting corruption. If you help Luzon then you won't be helping Mindanao. Etc. So no matter what you do, you're going to be ignoring a large number of problems close to you. If you try to do everything then you'll only accomplish a little in all of them, so that you are effectively ignoring 90% of the crime, 90% of the drug problem and so on.","created_utc":1520314595,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"SirBrendantheBold","body":"There are countless rebel factions within Syria but there a definite core. The YPG/J remain the only worthwhile of the core. But if we're going to individually discuss the minority factions let's go through the parties she has proclaimed to have armed and tried to justify.\n\nJaysh al-Islam are an Islamist group previously aligned with the Islamic Front. They have since switched their position to a more inclusive one but it's hardly a compelling conversion. They have continued fighting against factions which reject an Islamic state such as the second mentioned group, Failaq al Rahman. Failaq al Rahman are allied with the FSA. Ahrara al-Sham are an Islamic group seeking to create an Islamic government previously allied to the Islamic Front and now fighting under the FSA while maintaining their theocratic objective. Tahrir al-Sham are a Jihadist group and directly connected to Al-Qaeda.\n\nThat she acknowledges the atrocities of the groups is lovely but undercut immediately by her rationalization through the lens of Assad. \n\n&gt;So yes, there have been violations by the armed groups, and yes, they have also shelled civilian areas in Damascus. But by looking at the abuses of only one side, you are missing the point: first, the general population in Eastern Ghouta - which suffers the most - is not fighting; two, the regime is killing on a massive scale. Shelling by rebels killed 64 civilians in February in the whole of Syria, while regime bombardment killed 852. The regime, too, has arrested, forcibly disappeared, tortured and executed tens of thousands of people.\n\nOf course I sympathize with the horrors that the Syrian people are suffering. And I hold Assad in the same level of contempt that I hold ISIL. That doesn't change the fact that outside some of the minority factions, all major players and many of the smaller groups are absolute bastards excluding the YPG/J. \n\nMy condemnation was towards the primary core: Islamic Front, ISIL, Assad, Turkey, US, Russia, and the FSA. It was in no way targeting the civilians.\n\nAs to your next argument that there is equivalence between imperialist interference of the US and Turkey, let's put that to rest right away. The FSA have actively attacked the YPG alongside Turkish forces on multiple occasions. The US hasn't been shelling or chembombing villages of the FSA; Turkey has. The US hasn't proclaimed it their mission to 'cleanse' the FSA; Turkey has stated, in those terms, that objective towards the YPG. Your false equivalence is as worthless as it is dishonest. There is a massive difference between accepting support from an imperial player and actively attacking a formerly allied group and assisting (in the most direct and literal manner) a regime making overt overtures of ethnic barbarism.

That doesn't change the fact that outside some of the minority factions, all major players and many of the smaller groups are absolute bastards excluding the YPG/J. \n\nSo instead of showing solidarity with communities who continue to resist assad, you think only armed factions are worth supporting? If one applied this weird anti-anarchist view to palestine, then the Palestinian cause would have long been unjustifiable too. The strongest palestinian factions are hamas - Islamist antisemites supported by Iran - and fatah - corrupt collaborationists who are dependent on the us and Arab states. why is it that leftists understand we must support the Palestinian people themselves when it comes to israel-palestine but then do not apply this to syria? Because the fsa is corrupt and out of touch, because Islamists have hijacked sections of the movement, because foreign powers have meddled, etc. doesn't change the fact that the Syrian people have risen up against the regime and that they are the only participants worth supporting in this conflict, besides kurdish communities as well\n\n&gt;My condemnation was towards the primary core: Islamic Front, ISIL, Assad, Turkey, US, Russia, and the FSA. It was in no way targeting the civilians.\n\nAgain, this \"primary core\" is not what we as anarchists should be focused on. Leave that to the conservative realists in IR studies who view things cynically from state-centric lenses\n\n&gt;As to your next argument that there is equivalence between imperialist interference of the US and Turkey, let's put that to rest right away. The FSA have actively attacked the YPG alongside Turkish forces on multiple occasions. The US hasn't been shelling or chembombing villages of the FSA; Turkey has. The US hasn't proclaimed it their mission to 'cleanse' the FSA; Turkey has stated, in those terms, that objective towards the YPG. Your false equivalence is as worthless as it is dishonest. There is a massive difference between accepting support from an imperial player and actively attacking a formerly allied group and assisting (in the most direct and literal manner) a regime making overt overtures of ethnic barbarism. \n\nTerrible argument, really. 1) the u.s. hasn't been focused on destroying the fsa, but they have been an imperialist force that has killed thousands of syrians. Under the pretext of destroying isis, the u.s. has killed countless civilians across syria, destroying infrastructure and making the lives of syrians miserable, as documented by international human rights orgs and victims on the ground. The death count from current u.s. airstrikes in Syria and Iraq is much higher than anything turkey has done in syria.\n\n2) you convenient ignore that i also mentioned the ypg's relationship w the assad regime. I don't think I need to explain why that is problematic.\n\nAgain I am not necessarily blaming the ypg for doing that, only I think it's dishonest and hypocritical for you to criticize rebels for siding with turkey and ignore the ypg's murderous allies.","created_utc":1520360586,"score":0,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

People still remember the Days of Rage in Chicago, or Watts/Rodney King/Ferguson like they were yesterday.\n\n- Riot porn is a pretty good recruiting tool. Seattle might have done more for Anarchism than all of NEFAC. \n\n- Broken windows do physical/economic damage, which (if sustained) can shut down harmful businesses or entire industries (Fur stores in the UK, etc).\n\n- Broken windows can start a conversation - I'd argue that at least some (admittedly edgy) anti-gentrification actions have spawned more awareness than hate. \n\n- Broken windows can serve to highlight how fucking angry a community is in ways that words just can't.\n\n- Scary and unruly rebellions can drive authorities to make concessions or embrace our more peaceful/reformist allies. \n\n- Broken windows can trigger a state over-reaction which makes them look absolutely awful. People were mad about the black bloc at the G20 in Toronto for a week. Almost a decade later, they're still angry about the mass-arrests that followed. (Surgeon General's Warning: this tactic *will* fuck over your friends/neighbours/comrades pretty hard).\n\nI could list a lot more. It is really contentious and subjective, but the history of social change is full of it, from Haymarket to the Sufferagettes to Civil Rights and onward. It's hard to imagine those movements succeeding without some rioting (or, at the very least, that it hurt them much). The thing to remember, though, is that none of these examples happened in a vacuum or came without a cost. Also, plenty of other windows were broken along the way that accomplished nothing, or worse really fucked over the movement in really devastating ways (see \"propaganda of the deed\").

{"author":"OfficialDrakoak","body":"I posted this pic on facebook with the following caption:\n\n\"Look, I'm not saying we need to become a communist country, at all. All I'm saying is that all these people that keep saying capitalism is working are just plain wrong and this is proven by public statistics. Our version of capitalism is not free for anyone but the wealthy. You're so against the government telling you what to do (don't get me wrong I am too), but you think being free means having a boss substitute that role and tell you when you can take a shit, when you can eat, when you can use the phone, when you can do anything. And you think that freedom means having the choice of which boss/company you let have that kind of control over you. There are alternatives where everyone can live comfortably that do work and are working in other countries. We are not the best country in the world. We are number 1 in amount of employed people on welfare, number of incarcerated citizens per capita, and infant mortality. That is literally it. There are people, literally families with very young children that have frozen to death in our country this winter. And families that are and continue to starve to death in our country. This isn't just something that happens in Africa. Many parts of America are becoming third world status but you think capitalism is working just because you're not one of the people who were born into that situation. American Capitalism is not working, laissez-faire capitalism would only make matters 10x worse so the tea-partiers can shut the fuck up now. What our capitalism is, is essentially communism for the rich. The loaf of bread gets spread among the fat cats on top of the food chain while the rest of us fight over the crumbs, and you want to get angry at people who got a free crumb without fighting for it instead of getting angry at the guys who illegally obtained the entire loaf. Welfare fraud isn't an actual issue in this country, the percentage is so small it's not even worth the money to investigate, we've already been through this before and have already proven this. Maybe we should start investigating the corporate welfare and corporate tax cuts. Those are the people stealing your hard earned money. That's where most of your hard earned taxes get funneled back into. The rich.

This is one of the consequences of not being a vanguardist movement, and I'll gladly take those consequences.\n\nI heard just the opposite regarding which businesses were targeted, so I can't speak to that. Radical activism definitely has certain subcultural elements (the style of dress, average age, somewhat of an anti-work ethic in some circles, etc.).

Don't take it personal. \n\nIf you think that the best change is done from within the system (via politicians, philanthropists, etc.), rather than outside it, you may not be an anarchist  (naturally there's gains that can be made but to assume they'll fix fundamental problems is something else). That said, there's as many ways to conceptualize left anarchism as there are people within it, and your relation to it and to activism must be your own. \n\nA lot of us prefer to go beyond strictly hearts and minds and do some stuff in the streets where possible; Food Not Bombs, the IWW, and books-to-prisoners programs are good places to start.

A charismatic fascist is a VERY dangerous fascist. \n\nOf course fascists don't advertise themselves as fascists, they advertise themselves as patriots who are proud of their heritage and who want to make the world a better place - they just leave out the part about segregating/imprisoning non-white christians and keeping political dissidents down (like how the alt-right has committed terrorist attacks against liberals, communists, and anarchists alike)\n\nAnd people like **you** are the reason they get away with this shit. You say they have the right to free speech and nobody would follow their ideas, but if you knew anything about fascism in history, you would know it's rarely some violent takeover. It's about convincing people that your particular flavor of fascism *isn't* fascism, gaining power, and then enacting your ideology. That's how Hitler did it. He realized the problems Germany was having after WWI and targeted that; he picked a reason things were going wrong and slowly but surely took control. He said it was scientific; that the aryan was the superior race and that until Germany was cleansed of the non-aryans, they would not be the great nation they once were. People heard this, they thought it seemed pretty reasonable. I mean, it's backed by \"science\" after all, it MUST be true! Once he became chancellor, it was over. \n\nBut we can stop it.

{"author":"Christen_Color","body":"Fair enough. I don't know that I could really gain much from talking to someone or reading about stuff on r/communism101, since I'd pretty much just have to take everything at face value, and I'm generally of the mindset that unless you already trust your source a great deal, being able to question what you're told is an important part of learning anything meaningful, so I'll probably just go on my way with the understanding that there's one more thing that perhaps isn't quite as certain as it though it was previously. \n\nAnd I can understand that. I'm not really of the same mindset; I'm pretty sure there are plenty of books that discuss the upsides of communism, though probably not many that do so though an emotional and heart-felt tale kind of format (though frankly I think it at least feasible that that's largely because there isn't much demand for such books, and we live in a capitalist society where books cost money to print, and so they don't get published if the demand doesn't seem like it will sell enough copies to offset the cost of production) But the fact that most people understand our society as the good, and other societies that are different as being the bad, does kind of create an echo chamber where people are unlikely to see anything that might lead them to believe something other than what they already do regarding political ideologies. \n\nAnd I'm sorry, but I wasn't really able to follow your last paragraph. I have a lot of  difficulty with reading complex explanations, or organizing ideas in my head (ADHD makes reading really hard to begin with, and because of that I went without much reading for a while, my reading comprehension dropped, and now I'm trying to get back into the habit; so far my LOTR re-reading has been great, but it's still hard to follow stuff that's complex and/or fairly dry), and I know very little about geopolitics. If you'd be willing to give me an eli5 I'd be happy to listen and try to understand, but you're by no means obligated to.\n\nRegardless, I appreciate you taking the time to help me better understand some things better than I did before, even if all I understand better is that maybe I don't really understand some things as well as I thought I did \ud83d\ude05.

He wanted to experiment on \u201cprehistoric man\u201d who cannot feel as much pain as the European. It comes in the form of scientific racism, but it is white supremacy nonetheless.

{"author":"kitten_cupcakes","body":"If you aren't well-versed in this it would be a bad idea to challenge them, as they'll be ready for your comments.\n\nMy biggest concerns, personally, are\n\n**1)** *Advancing the speech of fascists silences minorities.*\n\nFascists make speech a zero-sum game. You will need to select content from modern fascists speeches and the historical silencing of minority (often Jewish) communities to provide an illustration.\n\n**2)** *The free market of ideas does not work. Moreover, they work under the assumption that \"the free market of ideas\" shouldn't be checked by... the free market of ideas?*\n\nThe free market of ideas is not magic. No invisible hand guides it toward what is most reasonable. It relies on the mistaken belief that people are perfectly rational actors who will always pick the most logical option, and that debate is always won through reason. This is an idiotic fiction that only the most gullible sort of person would believe. Examples abound of exactly the opposite happening. In fact, the history of fascism is a history of fascists screeching about their \"free speech,\" and using that argument to take power unmolested. Their \"speech\" is a tool they use to terrorize and recruit. That's all. Others, however, are silenced from criticizing fascists and their speech. **Others are stopped from making a decision predicated on actually having listened to fascist speech.** This is yet another example of \"the free market\" failing. Action is not allowed to be taken. Decisions are never made. \n\n**3)** *Fascists have framed the debate, once again, for the credulous and politically ignorant.*\n\nThis was never about speech. For a hundred years they've cried \"Speech!\" only to use it as a cover for their real intent: spreading terror and growing their movement. This is a very old tactic that is still in use by corporations today. Reframing the debate from \"We should be allowed to spread our movement, silence dissent, and take power\" to \"don't we deserve the right to speak also?\" has brought them into power time and time again. **They do not care about reasoned debate.** That is not the point at all. They know the weak point of neoliberals is their insistence that unregulated markets are best, so they hammer that. Unregulated markets only ever do one thing: enrich the one with the most power in the market. If you hand that platform over to the fascists, they have cornered the market. \n\n**4)** *Individuals and communities deserve the right to self defense and security.*\n\nForcing Jews, lgbt people, disabled people, and others to study alongside a growing fascist movement threatens their well-being. If I were to get up on stage and hand out fliers and argue  unchecked about how white conservative men must be made to suffer and die, I wonder how they'd react. I wonder how they'd react if I got up on stage and plastered propaganda all around the school urging people to bring a gun and shoot the attendees of that debate. Just have their image, their personal info, and some awful lies about them on the posters. Would they be ok with that? Because that's what fascists do to us. That's what this is about. Spreading fascism necessarily spreads violence against our communities. You **will** start seeing posters like that set up around campus if fascists are allowed to recruit students through their \"debate.\" If they are ok with fascists, then they **must** be ok with you threatening their lives in that way, otherwise it is clear that they are not \"unbiased\" in this. Do those speakers deserve the right to self defense? Why should that trump your right to \"free speech?\"\n\n**5)** *They would never argue in favor of ISIS giving a speech.

I just find that worrying about being hypocritical in a situation like this doesn't do any real good and is indicative of a liberal outlook on social relations.\n\nMy position is that if you believe in things, you're going to tend to act on them.  I declined promotions for years because I didn't believe in hierarchy enough to become a boss.  When I joined the IWW, that was good, since bosses and cops aren't allowed.  But what if that wasn't the case?  Whether I'm a boss or not isn't going to change workers material relationship to capital, so is it fine to be a boss or a cop?  Couldn't I be a really brutal boss or cop and accelerate change, making it a good thing?\n\nThis is where it breaks down for me.  People have personalities and senses of ethics which underlie their political beliefs, not the other way around.

But I fear the influence of the Syrian government, Turkey, and Russia on the region even more. \n\nThe Kurds recently blew up civilians with an IED planted in a road (likely intended for Turkish military). The YPG/J seriously need to work harder to avoid war crimes and killing civilians, since the Turkish government use such incidents to justify calling them terrorists. They are too easily associated with the PKK, so it's an uphill battle to fight against the notion of being terrorists. They have received training from the Geneva Call organization on how to treat prisoners, and they have been responsive to criticism, rejecting fighters younger than 18. \n\nIn all, the Kurdish movement is like any other revolutionary movement before this. A mix of hope, apprehension, and dread. I will remain hopeful, and I will not immediately dismiss the potential for the Kurds to succeed in maintaining a stable, democratic society.

But I'll give you a couple examples off the top of my head: \n\n- *What the Germans Lack* in Twilight of the Idols. \n- *The New Idol* in Thus Spake Zarathustra\n \nI could find more, but I'd have to have my books in front of me and some time. \n\nAlso, here are a couple quotes from Nietzsche to his sister that are informative on his views of anti-semitism: \n\n&gt; I've seen proof, black on white, that Herr Dr. F\u00f6rster [his sisters husband] has not yet severed his connection with the anti-Semitic movement. \u2026 Since then I've had difficulty coming up with any of the tenderness and protectiveness I've so long felt toward you. The separation between us is thereby decided in really the most absurd way. Have you grasped nothing of the reason why I am in the world? \u2026 Now it has gone so far that I have to defend myself hand and foot against people who confuse me with these anti-Semitic canaille; after my own sister, my former sister, and after Widemann more recently have given the impetus to this most dire of all confusions. After I read the name Zarathustra in the anti-Semitic Correspondence my forbearance came to an end. I am now in a position of emergency defense against your spouse's Party. These accursed anti-Semite deformities shall not sully my ideal!!\n\n&gt; You have committed one of the greatest stupidities \u2014 for yourself and for me! Your association with an anti-Semitic chief expresses a foreignness to my whole way of life which fills me again and again with ire or melancholy. \u2026 It is a matter of honor with me to be absolutely clean and unequivocal in relation to anti-Semitism, namely, opposed to it, as I am in my writings. I have recently been persecuted with letters and Anti-Semitic Correspondence Sheets. My disgust with this party (which would like the benefit of my name only too well!) is as pronounced as possible, but the relation to F\u00f6rster, as well as the aftereffects of my former publisher, the anti-Semitic Schmeitzner, always brings the adherents of this disagreeable party back to the idea that I must belong to them after all. \u2026 It arouses mistrust against my character, as if publicly I condemned something which I have favored secretly \u2014 and that I am unable to do anything against it, that the name of Zarathustra is used in every Anti-Semitic Correspondence Sheet, has almost made me sick several times.","created_utc":1520613135,"score":4,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"-space-man-spiff-","body":"How? Methodically, if you want to be successful.\n\nThe first step is to discreetly get contact information for as many of your co-workers as possible. If there is some kind of directory or phone list available, copy it now because it will disappear the second the boss suspects someone is organizing. If not, you will have to find some other way to get contact info.\n\nThis is an important step that can't be skipped. Organizing actions will need to be done outside of work. When the company is in union-busting mode you will be surveilled while you are on the clock. Put all this contact info in a spreadsheet.\n\nThat done, you will be ready to begin approaching co-workers for 1 on 1 chats. You want to get them out of work for this if possible so you can speak freely. Don't mention the U-word at this stage. The idea is to agitate, get them all riled up about whatever shitty working conditions you are experiencing. Start asking the question, \"What could we do to fix this?\" \n\nAs you do 1 on 1s, identify how on-board each coworker is. Go back to your contact info spreadsheet. Rank each coworker with a color code or a number or whatever on the basis of how down they seem with the idea of direct action against the boss. \n\nGo back to anyone who is definitely on board and arrange a meet with them outside of work. This is your committee, the beginnings of the union. If you have enough people at this point that you can plan some action without everyone just getting fired then do so. Find some small, achievable grievance and plan an action together to get it resolved. \n\nNote that you still aren't really using the \"U\" word at this point, you are just trying to demonstrate the point that collective action works. When people see this happening on a small scale is when things start to snowball.\n\nAnyway, regardless of whether you are carrying out direct actions at this stage or not, continue 1 on 1s, with your committee sharing the workload. As actions succeed, keep planning more and bigger ones. Wait until after you score a big win that everyone can see before you start talking about formalizing things with actual union membership. Don't sign on with any big business unions that may be sniffing around at that point, don't file for any NLRB elections, they just give your boss a window to union-bust at will without legal repercussions. Get everyone to join the IWW.\n\nAll this is basically the beginning of the IWW Organizer Training 101 curriculum, so if possible contact your local wobblies and get that training while you are collecting contact info and getting started.","created_utc":1520630237,"score":21,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

He attributed the underlying concept to Karl Marx. \n\n&gt; The interference of the state power in social relations becomes superfluous in one sphere after another, and then ceases of itself. The government of persons is replaced by the administration of things and the direction of the processes of production. The state is not \"abolished\", it withers away.\n\nMarx also said something which can be interpreted as meaning something similar, in \"Critique of the Gotha Programme\"\n\n&gt;Between capitalist and communist society there lies the period of the revolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Corresponding to this is also a political transition period in which the state can be nothing but the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nIt can only be interpreted as meaning something similar if you look at what Marx defines a \"communist society\" as, however.

A communist society is characterized by common ownership of the means of production with free access to the articles of consumption and is classless and stateless, implying the end of the exploitation of labour.\n\nCommunism is a specific stage of socioeconomic development predicated upon a superabundance of material wealth, which is postulated to arise from advances in production technology and corresponding changes in the social relations of production.

Modern finance capital was essentially discovered through lending practices developed by the merchant class at the time. The first sovereign debt, that is, a national debt held and managed by a bank, was written to fund the British Navy.  The logic for this is that war and its industries can not only profit tremendously, they would also guarantee   a means by which to secure payment of debts.  This created the Bank of England, and modern currency and money is modeled on this relationship between the state and capital. \n\nCould there be a stateless market economy? In principle, maybe, but, anthropologically, this has  never been observed. And the reasons for this are interesting. Markets are a means for the distribution of goods and service in a given community that requires some method of exchange (money).  Now the activity of exchanging goods and services for money has typically only ever appeared in civilizations that have occupying armies. Markets provided a means for the circulation of money (coinage) that the occupied territories would then be taxed.  Circulating currency that would be taxed later provided the means of supplying armies with provisions without needing to figure out the logistics of provisioning armies from home.  Before these territories were occupied, markets would most likely not be the preferred means of distributing goods and service, as there were typically forms of social organization dealing with tribute, sacrifice, and commoning to perform the tasks of markets.","created_utc":1520724508,"score":5,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Paczilla2","body":"For the sake of simplicity, ill just say that i view violence and non-violence as a strategy, each useful and each effective given certain context's. I don't believe in anything anyone would call 'in the right', its all a matter of perspective, circumstance and who's side you are on. What i want to know is simply \"is it effective\" and from what ive seen in my life and looking back through history, i see people who practice non-violence tend to get brutally murdered but with a sense of moral superiority that either leads to the continued slaughter of the people they want to protect until the people doing the slaughtering are fought back, using violence, or the people doing the slaughtering get, usually poor working people forced to be conscripts or economically pressured into the soldiers life become so horrified at the acts they are committing against people who don't fight back that they refuse to do it anymore. This problem can usually be solved however in a variety of ways, like rotating the people committing the violence so they don't become so horrified and you keep getting fresh faced young murderers or you can simple kill people from far away. Shooting the peaceful villagers tends to De-moralize your own troops, so they bomb them instead, or use starvation as a weapon so that the violence is in-direct. \n\nUltimately, it doesn't matter who's in the 'right' you don't need to be to kill alot of people, and all you do by sitting their and wagging your finger saying those doing the killing are in the wrong only has an effect when enough people agree with you, which requires a whole lot of people to die or have other horrible things happen to them before anyone even considers stopping, but you know what does stop a people from killing other people? Killing them. Ya, its not a great solution, but its a time tested method. \n\nAnyone can stand up and say people are bad for doing committing violence, its not a hard stance to take. We as human being don't really like to hurt one another if we can avoid it, and yet we do, we kill each other, we rape each other, we burn whole cities full of innocent men, women and children and are able to brush it off as acceptable casualties. The human capacity for violence is astonishingly horrifying, almost as equally amazing as our capacity for love and compassion with for one another and even creatures of other species, fuck, if you try hard enough you can make people feel empathy for inanimate objects. But that capacity for violence over can over power our empathy and compassion. \n\nLet's look at the ovens of [Auschwitz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGdHdE7l9dI), where they burned the pacifist's, anyone else they wanted to. Who's moral outrage saved them? How about the War on Vietnam? How many people had to die, how many lives had to be ruined, how many [children's skin needed to be melted away by napalm](http://images.slideplayer.com/24/7395601/slides/slide_31.jpg) because the American people weren't willing to take up arms against a government committing crimes against humanity? And how were they stoped? Was it moral outrage? Ya, in a way, because the people they were murdering fought back, sending home your Uncle Willy back home in a wooden box with a nice flag on top causeing you friends and family to rethink senseless slaughter.\n\nThe only way non-violence can really work is if the escalation of violence hasn't already occurred, and this is already based on the assumption that power will not use violence if you oppose it effectively, which we have seen to not be the case over and over and over again. You know that the power doesn't see you as a threat if they let you peacefully protest because it not a threat to them, you can do it over and over and over and but it wont change the situation. And whenever you do make any kind of progress, what do they usually do? Throw you in a room with toss the key away or they blow your brains out, because it works. \n\nI do not want violence to be an effective option, i don't want people to kill each other over, but they do, and they will continue to do it despite if its 'right' or not. I would much rather fight on my feet against people who wish to do me and the people i care about harm, than to die on my knees with a sense of moral superiority and watch the things and people i care about be thrown against the wall. Lets not forget, the death of a martyr is still a death, they're gone, forever.

Absurd stuff; shoot the caps off ballpoint pens and the like, with just intuitive aim. \n\nIt's not a practical weapon in modern combat, of course, but if you want to, say, hit a roughly face sized area on an otherwise armored target, it would do it, even while walking perpendicular to the target at a brisk pace. Of course, when the targets shoot back, I imagine much of that accuracy will go out the window due to hand holding it.  Still, though... damn fine pistol.

Obviously the kurdish forces expending themselves against ISIS was good for everyone  (though the Kurds themselves, least of all), but now that they're attempting to secure their gains, the other shoe is dropping.\n\nThis is fucking terrible. Getting used by American interests was gross, but ISIS has to die (its ideological adherents, anyway, there's a mix of other folks in their ranks that would probably go home, but it's impossible to tell the difference in a firefight). Now that they're not \"useful,\" they'll lose crucial American fire support, which was key in their victories to date. So they're going to die. This isn't a smug or triumphant assertion. This is abjectly anguished analysis from your neighborhood anarcho-communist intel vet. Syrian and Russian airstrikes on \"rebels\" routinely include kurdish populations, Turkey's sitting on a majority of ethnic kurdish land, and as a NATO partner, the US is going to let them \"secure their interests\" over those of our heretofore useful proxies (who they recognize as terrorists except when it's useful to say otherwise), which is basically a euphemism for genocide.\n\nThey have no friends in the region, and no friendly port unless they take it back from Turkey, which won't happen. They won't be eradicated, but they will be besieged and bombed until they are broken, as a fighting force, and as a 'nationalist' cause (albeit a sympathetic one by way of communalism).\n\nThis scenario was forseen by British colonialists, and is key to understanding why those borders were drawn as they are; the Kurds are strategically disenfranchised, and dealing with the repercussions of that is left to the now autonomous powers that remain, distracting them from threatening Europe.

{"author":"ItLiesInTheProles","body":"I wan't being critical, I was just wondering your take on it. Like, I'm more interested in the specific social arrangements that you see that were really beneficial. By late 1917 the workers committees were routinely assaulted by the Bolsheviks, with the Bolsheviks arguing that factory committees were not true communist-party organs, and that they would need to be put under the direction of the party. See the follow up to the All Russian Council for Workers' Control's decrees in their only meeting, local and regional committees would be directed by the central party, and the almost immediate usurption by the Supreme Soviet of the National Economy.\n\nThat's sort of the larger take though, I'm wondering how the immediate institution of workplace was different. Were bosses abolished? How was work radically changed?\n\nEmma Goldman from My Disillusionment with Russia:\n&gt; The great flour mill oil Petrograd, visited next, looked as if it were in a state of siege, with armed soldiers everywhere even ins I de the workrooms. The explanation given was that large quantities of precious flour had been vanishing. The soldiers watched the millmen as if they were galley slaves, and the workers naturally resented such humiliating treatment They hardly dared to speak. One young chap a fine-looking fellow, complained to me of the conditions. \u201cWe are here virtual prisoners,\u201d lie said; \u201cwe cannot make a step without permission We are kept hard at work eight hours with only ten minutes for our kipyatok [boiled water] and we are searched on leaving the mill.\u201d \u201cIs not the theft Of flour he cause of the strict surveillance?\u201d I asked. \u201cNot at all,\u201d replied the boy; \u201cthe Commissars of the mill and the soldiers know quite well where the I\u2019M= goes to.\u201d I suggested that the workers might protest against such a state of affairs. \u201cProtest, to whom?\u201d the boy exclaimed; \u201cwe\u2019d be called speculators and counter-revolutionists and we\u2019d be arrested.\u201d \u201cHas the Revolution given you nothing?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh, the Revolution! But that is no more. Finished,\u201d he said bitterly. [...]\n\n&gt;The following morning we visited the Laferm tobacco factory. The place was in full operation. We were conducted through the plant and the whole process was explained to us, beginning with the sorting of the raw material and ending with the finished cigarettes packed for sale or shipment. The air in the workrooms was stiffing, nauseating. \u201cThe women are used to this atmosphere,\u201d said the guide; \u201cthey don\u2019t mind.\u201d There were some pregnant women at work and girls no older than fourteen. They looked haggard, their chests sunken, black rings under their eyes. Some of them coughed and the hectic flush of consumption showed on their faces. \u201cIs there a recreation room, a place where they can eat or drink their tea and inhale a bit of fresh air?\u201d There was no such thing, I was informed. The women remained at work eight consecutive hours; they had their tea and black bread at their benches. The system was that of piece work, the employees receiving twenty-five cigarettes daily above their pay with permission to sell or exchange them.\n\n&gt; ... Life certainly has a way of playing peculiar pranks. In America I should have scorned the of social welfare work: I should have conslidered it a cheap palliative. But in Social\u2019 Russia the sight of pregnant women working in suffocating tobacco air and saturating themselves and their unborn with the poison Impressed me as a fundamental evil. I spoke to Lisa Zorin to see whether something could not be done to ameliorate the evil. Lisa claimed that piece work\u201d was the only way to induce the girls to work. As to rest rooms, the women themselves had already made a fight for them, but so far nothing could be done because no space could be spared in the factory. \u201cBut if even such small improvements had not resulted from the Revolution,\u201d I argued, \u201cwhat purpose has it served?\u201d \u201cThe workers have achieved control,\u201d Lisa replied; \u201cthey are now in power, power, and they have more important things to attend to than rest rooms \u2014 they have the Revolution to defend.\u201d Lisa Zorin had remained very much the proletarian, but she reasoned like a nun dedicated to the service of the Church.\n\n&gt;The thought oppressed me that what she called the \u201cdefence of the Revolution\u201d was really only the defence of her party in power. At any rate, nothing came of my attempt at social welfare work.\n\nSo what am I, or what are the anarchists missing in this revolution that you're seeing and we're not.","created_utc":1520800325,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"manicdave","body":"The argument that it's down to being called racist is partially true.\n\nThe police here practice whats called community policing (which is mostly a success story) where they work with the community as opposed to working against it, which means listening to the community on how they think it should be policed. \n\nThe root of the issue is that ultra conservative muslims in some of these areas have wrangled their way in to becoming the main points of contact for police relations. They have spun the narrative that young muslim men are incapable of self control for cultural reasons and it's something the community should deal with because it would be politically insensitive to apply the law universally. These community leaders obviously had no intention of doing anything because they have the same views of non muslim women as the rapists. The situation got past the point where it wouldn't be embarrassing for the police to recognise the issue and it turned into a cover up. This turned into a feedback loop where certain young muslim men knew the law did not apply to them and the culture of rape gangs blossomed.\n\nI feel like I need to point out that this is a minority of muslim men. I live in one of these areas and the muslims I know acknowledge the issue and are disgusted by it. The issue now seems to be that people are trapped between the far right English and far right Muslims. If they come out publicly they will be framed as traitors in their own community, and the English right wing will run with their condemnation, but frame them as the exception to the rule, not the silent majority.

For it to become an \u201cintolerable\u201d power, i.e. a power against which men make a revolution, it must necessarily have rendered the great mass of humanity \u201cpropertyless,\u201d and produced, at the same time, the contradiction of an existing world of wealth and culture, both of which conditions presuppose a great increase in productive power, a high degree of its development. And, on the other hand, this development of productive forces (which itself implies the actual empirical existence of men in their world-historical, instead of local, being) is an absolutely necessary practical premise because without it want is merely made general, and with destitution the struggle for necessities and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced; and furthermore, because only with this universal development of productive forces is a universal intercourse between men established, which produces in all nations simultaneously the phenomenon of the \u201cpropertyless\u201d mass (universal competition), makes each nation dependent on the revolutions of the others, and finally has put world-historical, empirically universal individuals in place of local ones. Without this, (1) communism could only exist as a local event; (2) the forces of intercourse themselves could not have developed as universal, hence intolerable powers: they would have remained home-bred conditions surrounded by superstition; and (3) each extension of intercourse would abolish local communism. Empirically, communism is only possible as the act of the dominant peoples \u201call at once\u201d and simultaneously, which presupposes the universal development of productive forces and the world intercourse bound up with communism. Moreover, the mass of propertyless workers \u2013 the utterly precarious position of labour \u2013 power on a mass scale cut off from capital or from even a limited satisfaction and, therefore, no longer merely temporarily deprived of work itself as a secure source of life \u2013 presupposes the world market through competition.

By and large it seems that anarchists play a zero-sum game; if you aren't with us, you're against us, and you're therefore the enemy. \n\nThat's not an approach that wins friends and converts, it just reinforces the idea that anrchism is for people on the fringe who only think of themselves and their self-righteous goals. Fascism offers peace, security, and freedom from the truths anarchists fight so hard to show the rest of the world. Right now people don't want the truth; they want a happy lie that will demand nothing of them beyond obedience and and silence.\n\n I know that it isn't supposed to be friendly to everyone, particularly to the oppressors, but it lacks something that draws people to any other ideology; a \"what's in it for me\" factor. Capitalism offers people a chance to be better than their peers by stepping over them, into a life that's better than elsewhere. Nevermind that it's slim and largely a lie; people prefer the idea that maybe one day they'll be better than everyone else, concretely, through things like corner offices and bonuses and gated communities with big houses and expensive gadgets they can only afford because they're *better*. Anarchism doesn't offer that.\n\nIt's also due partly to decades of propaganda painting anarchists in an unfair light, but a share of the blame rests on anarchists themselves. In talking to many, and even on this sub, this stereotype of a person who sneers down their nose at the things people hold near to their hearts and lashes out with polarizing ultimatums like \"Fuck the pigs\" is constantly perpetuated.

{"author":"Rev1917-2017","body":"Well, there was a time that Anarchism was much more accepted around the world. The early labor movement in the United States was a Libertarian Socialist/Anarchist movement. Of course Spain and Russia both had very large Libertarian Socialist/Anarchist populations. Anarchists were a part of all of the early Communist uprisings and attempts. \n\nSo why did that change? Well, it's because neither the Capitalists in America, or the Bolsheviks in the new Soviet Union wanted people to think that Anarchism was possible. Because if people came to a mass awakening to that, they wouldn't need them anymore. So they both brutally cracked down on Anarchists and other agitators. At the same time, they both used their spectacular propaganda machines to wipe it out of public conscious, and associate the very idea of Anarchy with hooligans and criminals. They were painted as the great other, the enemy at the gates. For the Capitalists, they were lawless communists planning to destroy the very western way of life. For the Soviets, they were painted as capitalist forces that sought to destroy the great Soviet Revolution.  After all, if you were for the revolution, you were for the Bolsheviks. And if you weren't for the Bolsheviks, you were against the revolution. \n\nGenerations have passed since Anarchism has had a serious place at the table in America. Most of the American Anarchist heroes have been coopted by the Liberals as one of their own. Their struggles sanitized such as the Stone Wall Riots, or May Day; Or else they are generally lost to history. \n\nWe have all lived our entire lives under the rule of The State. Almost all of us have been taught that we live in a Government for by and of the people. Even those who feel cheated or on the losing side generally think that all that needs to happen is for a different Government to be in control. Because life under The State is the only life we know. Stepping outside of that is uncomfortable, and the propaganda tells us that it's impossible. This creates a very strong Cognitive Dissonance inside peoples heads. Some of us are good at identifying and resolving CogDis. Most people aren't. I saw this when I was still very religious. I, and those who participated in the reddit group for my church, all knew the other sides arguments for why we were wrong. But CogDis is strong, and allows us to explain away or just ignore the uncomfortable ideas that we hear that we don't want to entertain. It took me years to break through my religious cogdis, and also to break through my statist cogdis as well. \n\nAnd honestly, it took learning about Anarchists for me to do so. We aren't doing a good enough job on the education front. I don't just mean agitprop, I mean actually spreading the idea that another way is possible. And it's one of those things that you can't just hear from one source. You alone talking to your friends might not be enough to break them. But if you are talking to them, and then they see other videos or other people and watch/listen then that is another force pushing on to their beliefs. Enough sources and eventually their \"shelves break\" to borrow a religious term. \n\nOf course, as Marx points out, material conditions being shit will also add to those stressors on their belief. As things continue to get worse, and Anarchists continue to become more vocal in our beliefs and our ideas, I think more people will eventually continue to turn. After all, how many of us were Anarchists 10 years ago, but proudly are now?

The J20 arrests and abuse of protesters over a couple windows demonstrates the abuses of the system on her people. It has been pretty effective.\n\nSee, the fascists fight as a joke. The antifascists fight like their life depends on it. The fascists actually kill people because they hold great anger and hate, the antifascists just want peace and to live without the fear of fascists spreading hate and rumors in their direction.\n\nThey present this like it's a great ideological fight, but the Fascist/Antifascist debate is pitted like one kid bullying another kid so both of them get in trouble when they fight. I fought back against my bullies in school and learned how absolutely useless authority's rules are to such malicious behavior, and now that I continue my behavior into adulthood to match those bullies that have continued their behaviors into adulthood, I'm still considered a troublemaker. Felt proud when my bully's bloody nose netted detention then, still feel proud when it nets prison now.\n\nNow, the bully in any scenario will try to flip the narrative to make their victim look like a bully. Their worldview is built around being the victim of some sort of bullying. That might even be true of me, so we better use some real logic instead of finger pointing and ad hominim's.

Anxious, would rather not deal with any of this bullshit, and legitimate afraid of the words their bullies use to condemn them.\n\nAntifa will always remain a paradox in your mind, by painting it as a moral equivalent to Richard Spencer, you assume we've failed in achieving our goals.

On the other hand, fascist leaders point to the decadence of those elites as proof of their feebleness in the face of an overwhelming popular will.  \n  \n - \"Contempt for the Weak\", in which every member of society is superior to outsiders by virtue of belonging to the in-group.  \n  \nThe problem Antifa creates for Fascists is they disprove these points.

Still, there is Afrin itself, and the YPG's experience in urban warfare would normally be advantageous here. Also, so far, it seems the YPG has managed to keep themselves from being drawn into any set-piece battles, but this option goes out the window once the T-FSA has Afrin surrounded.  And Erdogan has shown no hesitation in sacrificing the lives of the T-FSA to grind the YPG down in a battle of attrition - we should expect even worse when the siege itself starts proper. Almost as bad is that Assad's military is essentially re-occupying the south-eastern part of the canton as the YPG, understandaby, leaves to partake in the critical situation on the outskirts of Afrin. In other words, the fate of Afrin has essentially already been decided, and whatever good has been done there will be extinguished with the utmost brutality. But it gets even worse in the long run, I'm afraid. A Turkish victory in Afrin, no matter how costly, will not only embolden the militarists inside Erdogan's government, but also discourage the YPG's so-called \"allies\", which will have a deleterious effect on their logistics.

Who do you think that affected more?\n\nWhen the Black Panthers started carrying guns, it caused Ronald *fucking* Reagan of all people to proclaim that no citizen needs to carry a gun on the streets, and effectively banned carry in California. \n\nSome jurisdictions require hundreds of dollars in fees and countless hours of jumping through legal loopholes in order to own a gun.

I might not be a Rhodes Scholar in graffiti, but the majority of illegal street artists tend NOT to completely prep a wall with tinned paint for rollers or to identify themselves. (Banksy being a major exception)\n\nThe roller paint was most likely done by a buffer/cleaner hired to cover up previous graffiti. But it is not at all unusual for illegal graffiti artists use tins of paint and rollers.\n\nBasically all illegal graffiti paintings are signed, most often they only consist of the signature. These signatures are not real names.\n\nWith 'multiple colours' i am talking about paintings which are not tags which are large an complex, which are also illegal.\n\nOn one hand you say those murals you cite were not approved, then afterwards you say they were. Which is it?\n\nCouncils regularly paint over murals which did not get approval, or they demand the owner do it or face a fine. \n\nOwners can also get murals approved after they have already been painted.\n\nThe 4000 painting has council approval, the George Michael and 'Tony Abbot's special day' painting were both painted over. Maybe by vigilantes, but it's been months and neither of the paintings were restored.\n\nI'm not sure about the specific 'decolonise' mural you are talking about, but i know of a couple different Decolonise murals which council had painted over the past few years.\n\nCouncil also painted over the anti-Burqua painting years ago. It hasn't been there since 2014.\n\nBut, to be fair, sometimes the council chooses to ignore an unapproved painting, and they simply don't worry about it. \n\nHeaps of businesses operate without adhering to all the proper council regulations, people get away with unapproved renovations and building work all the time.\n\nAs with most things with council, you can get away with it as long as no one lodges a complaint.\n\nEDIT: So after looking into it just now, it appears that Sydney City Council just recently changed their street art approval policy in mid 2017. I wasn't aware of that, so now in Sydney city you no longer  need to submit a DA to get a mural painted on your property.\n\nFrom what i've been able to read though, this change has not occurred at other councils.

{"author":"TheNotoriousAMP","body":"So I'm a bit of an outsider (sympathize strongly with a lot of anarchist beliefs but tend to trend a bit more towards the modern neo-liberal school- it's weird but my section at the end explains why it might be more common that you'd might think). I'm also a third year law student, so this kind of shapes my own questions about anarchism. I think a core problem with getting more support for anarchism is the lack of an ability to visualize the society you are voting for.\n\nEvery successful modern ideology has been able to give a general promise of what society you will wake up to when you vote for it. If you vote for a left-liberal party you know you will wake up to a similar society with stronger social protections and a safety net. An Afghan peasant who supports the Taliban knows generally what his life will look like under them. A Russian city dweller supporting the early communist movement could see what they would provide in the short term, with the more utopian aspects being defined as a process. \n\nBy contrast, anarchism for the most part remains highly intellectual and hasn't really communicated what your day to day life will look like. Let's focus on how the law will work. When I vote for left leaning candidates I know how this is going to shape how the jury process and law enforcement will work. By contrast, let's look at Anarchist solutions for law enforcement.\n\nRight now, the current solution seems to be a voluntary militia combined with citizen's courts. Alright, how do we stop this from being a lynch mob? How do we prevent peer relations from defining who is guilty? I am not going to try and pretend that the modern court system isn't highly problematic, I fucking hate jury trials, but at least I know how to mitigate its problems and have some basic protections, through highly developed rules and principles. Let's say I have a super racist juror. Under the current system, I can potentially impeach the verdict through rules of evidence. How do I do this in an anarchist society? I know this is super technical, but forests are made up of trees. If you want to provide a forest to voters, it's important to have in the back of your mind the working parts that make up that solution. \n\nLet's take this to a larger scale. Modern society is defined by the rise and power of the administrative state, especially many of progressive principles embraced by anarchism, such as environmental protections and social rights. What does an anarchist administrative hearing look like? It's all good and well to talk about voluntary associations and consensus on new mechanisms, but that's the easy part. The hard part is creating the regulatory mechanism to ensure those principles are achieved, like when people can appeal, how that appeal works, ect. \n\nMore than any other ideology, Anarchism is a direct response to the professionalism of the state, yet is also heavily dependent on creating similar mechanisms to what that professional state provides. This is why it has been easy to paint it as utopian. \n\nThis is also where I think anarchism sort of has an issue explaining its raison d'etre. The primary focus of most anarchists is on a more just society that allows for a much greater quality of life for its members. So we can sort of divide it between objective 1: better economic equality which is accomplished through objective 2: creation of a system of voluntary self association.\n\nThe problem here is that objective 1 has multiple other systems that promise the same objective but through other mechanisms. For example, left-neoliberalism embraces Georgism (land taxes on rentier capitalism), strong social equality, universal basic income, universal healthcare, more equal access to education (especially at improving high school level) ect. Hell, even the right wing embraces an element of worker ownership of companies, through stock options (as heavily supported by Reagan). Of course, it's nowhere near the full thing, but modern anarchism needs to reckon with the degree to which its goals in terms of results (not mechanism) have been adopted by other parties. \n\nSo, on the face of it both modern anarchism and left-neoliberalism are promising a voter seeking those goals the same basic platform, but through two radically different mechanism, one familiar, one radically different. Now, the anarchist will say that their platform is not dependent on the inherent power imbalances posed by capitalism, and this is highly appealing. No one really likes their boss, and the core of modern liberalism is the tension between the inherent challenges capitalism poses to equal competition and advancement vs. the belief that the free market provides that access to advancement. \n\nThe anarchist should win that vote, but the problem is the lack of answers. A technocratic party can provide mechanisms and answers that can be visualized by a voter through looking at their day to day society. \"Your boss will pay higher taxes, we'll shift money from this department to that one, ect.\" By contrast, the anarchist solution, even if it may provide a measurably better result, is still heavily reliant on unknowns. This is what pushes voters towards the familiar. Even democratic socialists struggle with this problem, though to a lesser degree. I had a lot of trouble voting for Sanders, despite agreeing with a lot of his platform. For example, almost everyone agrees we need to break up the banks. The question is, how? Bernie's solution in his bill was basically \"the treasury shall break up banks.\" Okay, at what size? How are the assets redistributed? How does this work legally? The same goes for healthcare, almost everyone agrees that the current system we have is absolutely not what we would do if we were starting from scratch. The easy answer is thus \"elites are preventing us from having the true system we want!\" The problem is solving the issue requires moving past this stage and into the much harder task of addressing how each actor is involved in the system. What do we do with the large chunk of people whose employer provided healthcare is better than what medicare for all would provide? How we do we address the economic roles hospitals play in small towns? Who wins, who loses, and how do we distribute the money? This is where things get difficult, and the trees start to matter.\n\nThis is the hump that anarchism has to pass to succeed, and in large part its a matter of refocusing discussion away from the end goal and more towards the path to that end goal. Talking about a voluntary society is fun, but the real question is how you get there. This is how communist parties have been able to rise to power, they set out not only an end state but also step by step goals towards that end state. For example, land distribution, state capitalism, ect. For all of its flaws, a key strong point of Marxism for gaining support was the fact that it approached politics from a scientific point of view and had a detailed (though flawed) view of how economics and the evolution of society functioned. A ground level activist had a roadmap available to provide to voters on where they are going to go. Anarchists need to think about how they are going to shift the EPA towards a non-professional state while still accomplishing its goals. Do we shift towards an online democracy method to assess how as a society group we value cost based analysis? Do we ignore CBA altogether? Or do we de-politicize agencies altogether and replace them with a panel of expertise that provide solutions which are then adopted by consensus? \n\nThe final issue is historical. Anarcho-syndicalism was heavily dependent on mobilization at the factory level at a time when work was heavily communal and long term. When the economy is driven by mass firms employing thousands in a central location, it's a lot easier to organize communal groups based upon work place and build outwards. The modern economy has trended towards fracturing the work place and economic productivity is now heavily driven by smaller, more professional, groups. This makes it a lot harder to organize societies by workplace. In addition, it has also drastically decreased worker influence over the economy. During industrial times a general strike could bring economic outflow to a stand still. Now a days it would still hurt, but most groups able to strike in a manner that hurt are easily replaced by unskilled labor. \n\nTL;DR: anarchism's two main issues in gaining greater acceptance primarily first lie in getting voters to visualize how they will achieve their end goals and the steps needed to get there. Secondly, there is a separation between anarchist goals for greater economic equality and their preferred mechanism of an anarchist societies. Other groups have been promising similar economic end goals through more familiar mechanisms and anarchism hasn't really adapted to address why those offers are basically half way measures and why the anarchist method is superior.","created_utc":1520871461,"score":5,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

It's kind of like how settlements work in litigation, when everyone knows roughly the value of their position relative to the agreed rules it makes it a lot easier to figure out how the grey zone should be interpreted.

I think you asked a lot of questions in one of the Marxist 101 subs and we probably both know how those went. I only started looking into \"leftist\" ideas a few years ago. I only really started reading a few years ago at all tbh. The depression, angst, despair, I can only say it comes and goes. I always wonder but don't have time because I'm focused on other projects to look into shit like anti-psychiatry thought because I often wonder about how my psychology is a result of this shitty society. My problems with impulse control, my \"diagnosis\", my \"personality\" measured on their scales as though my life and mind isn't unique but as common as the length of a piece of string, is all partly determined by this awful world... Yet I still have this tiny bit of freedom, the freedom worth fighting for, the freedom that at times brings more despair but rarely, but truly, gives real happiness and real humanity. Our despair is not solely from the knowledge about the horrors of this world and our inability to stay blissfully ignorant, rather the despair comes from knowing about this real humanity that is possible but crushed. I don't know where I am today politically, but lately I try not to think about it too much because of this kind of thinking.

You don't understand this stuff, so you assume it's supposed to do something it wasn't, and you draw your conclusions from there. This form of vapid and superficial analysis of someone's actions without seriously listening to their intention paints you as some sort of ignorant asshole. In truth, we acknowledge that these actions are mere spectacle, and they get people talking, and now you are talking about Antifa. They demonstrate systemic overreaction and they help to keep the police's attention on black block and those willing to be arrested so peaceful protesters don't get rounded up with them. It's pretty effective at achieving it's goals, and the police's response to it was to just march on all peaceful protesters and prove to us that the First Amendment is no longer protected in the United States.\n\n&gt;Lol antifa literally has no power. No one has equivalated it to the Nazis except you. Why am I not surprised some pussy finds strength in fighting inbred Nazis that no one's sympathetic to?\n\nI would consider our president to be more than \"no one.\" I don't know why you chose to ignore his reaction to Charlottesville. It informs much of his beliefs, and his follower's beliefs. I guess this is one of those things that you only notice if you're not an asshole that prizes his ignorance. To say \"no one has equivalated[sic] [antifa] to the Nazis\" is to profess one's ignorance at geopolitics. I'm sure any bit of research into this matter may leave you more informed, but vomiting your bullshit into a subreddit of people who know better isn't going to make you a lot of friends. I suggest listening more. If you did, you'll notice I didn't even \"equivalate\" Antifa and Nazis, I pointed out how this idea was a myth.\n\nFascism comes in many forms, and often the people tattooing themselves with \"1488\" aren't the people you should be most concerned about in this matter. It's the populists, the ones that would give up any moral or ethical look at running a system and decide instead to cater to any group they can sway into voting for them. When such populists soak up the attention of the skinhead neo-nazis, they set policies that support the neo-nazi's worldview much to the detriment of the populations these groups scapegoat. Being anti-fascist isn't just targeting neo-nazis, or protesting fascist politicians, it comes to analyzing how such a system can and has been allowed to grow, and disrupting every facet of that- to protect the victims of scapegoating. Antifa works in anonymity, it works with minimal exposure, and it works on an individual basis. And beyond everything else, it works.\n\nI have to thank Spencer though. He did point out that I wasn't honoring the freedom of speech, not the freedom to chant racial screeds like he interpreted, but the freedom for extreme worldviews to be allowed to represent themselves. It caused me to really take a look at my biases and be more open to new political ideologies that weren't just Conservatism and Liberalism. I learned not just what the Nazis believed from themselves, but also the Marxists and the Anarchists as wells. I found these latter groups to be more informed about history, science, and logic than the other groups, and it really swayed my opinion of this whole \"Anarchism\" thing.","created_utc":1520887094,"score":5,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Liberals... are loud... and i mean REALLY loud. And they can be pretty darn annoying with the way they go about things.\nThen you have conservatives, the alt-right etc. They are really damn loud too.\nIf you are in the middle, you might think \"Hmmm, those liberals are rediculous... I hate them.\"\nNow, alt-right people can be very smart and clever. that make use of that feeling of injustice in the world, the feeling that something is wrong with society.\n\nUs anarchists are not really loud at all. I didn't even know about anarchism or communism till about a year ago.\nAs other people have said, the alt-right likes to present themselves in a certain way. such as milo and richard spencer. They put on nice clothes, groom their hair, and talk about things in a way that a person is easily deceived. and once they have you, they manipulate you. they can be very subtle with the shit they say. So alot of people fall for their bullshit and then slowly become radicalized into groups such as neo-nazis.\n\nI personally believe that the best thing we can do to get more people to become anarchists (which i believe exactly what /u/gypsydrifter already said about how most people are anarchists at heart.) is spreading information and talking to people.\n\nThere are certain things that some anarchists like to say that can really confuse people and make them go \"Yeah, well fuck you too.\".\nWhen i first became an anarchist, i had quite a few arguments with other anarchists that were not really met with understanding.\nFor example \"Kill all white people\". Now, i understand what we mean by this. and i understand that they are not personally attacking me. BUT, alot of people do not see it and understand it this way and will feel attacked.\n\nThe right makes alot of jokes about us. about how we are against white people. and how we want to kill all white people.\n\nNow don't get mad at me. but i personally think that this is partially our fault.\nWe have our jokes, we have our believes, we have our thoughts.\nBut these things can sometimes not get across to other people in the way we mean them.\n\nThat is what i believe turns away alot of people from anarchism and communism. \n\nFor example, we yell \"Kill whitey!\".\nNow, people who don't realy know about anarchism or communism go \"Why are they saying they want to kill white people?\"\nThen the alt-right comes along and says \"See? They want white genocide!\".\nAnd lets be honost, we tend to go \"Yeah this but unironicly!\"\n\nThis turns so many people away from anarchism/communism and it throws them right into the arms of the right.\n\nNow, i love all of my beautifull comrades, but lets not deny that for outsiders, we can be a confusing mess to outsiders.\n\nThis is just my personal opinion and thoughts on why more people \"aren't\" anarchists. &lt;3","created_utc":1520887573,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

We developed similar tech with cheaper budget built by recycled materials that sustainable for farmer to self maintain. We also used swarm intelligent to ease the work.

Other local organizations from China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Taiwan, Thailand and The Philippines who utilized or improved our tech have since been teaching them to farmers around Indochina.\n\nThe cops thing at Chiang Mai is complicated. We bribed off the officials but they are divided into Red Shirts and Yellow Shirts, meaning you have to bribe both. Do not listen to the Western liberal's gossip about either side, they both equally corrupted. Chiang Mai is stronghold of Red Shirts, or pro Thaksin. Look like we accidentally bribed too much to the Red Shirts faction, pissed off the Yellow Shirts. They are mostly police and military or powerful people. And they harassed families of the scientist lady who maintain the project. They could not find her and they barged straight to the rice fields where she worked and shoot at the drones. When she and the farmers confronted at them and offered more bribe she were shot at by a pig. We missed our sleeps and flown straight to Thailand right away.

{"author":"p00bix","body":"The Khmer Rouge didn't seize control of Cambodia as the result of an anarchism-cause power vacuum. There was never a large anarchist movement within Cambodia, and anarchists never overthrew the Cambodian Republic. \n\nThe Khmer Rouge's rise to power began as an insurgency in Eastern Cambodia in 1968. It blended a mixture of authoritarian socialist economics (mostly based on those of Mao's China) with far-right Cambodian nationalism. \n\nThe Khmer Rouge obtained some support from North Vietnam and the Viet Cong, the later of which was already highly active in Eastern Cambodia, having recruited a large number of Vietnamese-Cambodian communists. As part of Nixon's broader battle against Communists, the American Air Force began bombing Eastern Cambodia in 1969 to root out the Viet Cong. In response, thousands of Viet Cong fighters seized populated areas--hoping that using civilians as human shields they could be spared. \n\nWith over 4000 civilians killed in only two months, American bombing campaigns fueled anti-American and anti-capitalist sentiment, fueling support for the Khmer Rouge. This severely angered right-wing elements within Cambodia, who were furious with Sihanouk's failure to control the Khmer Rouge and Viet Cong, as well as his percieved shift towards more left-wing politics (including secret diplomatic agreements with North Vietnam). The economy was undergoing a severe recession. Even non-right wing liberals were angered by Sihanouk's increasingly dictatorial rule.\n\nTensions peaked in March of 1970, as anti-Vietnamese and anti-communist riots overwhelmed the North Vietnamese embassay. Purportedly uncovering documents revealing a plot for communist takeover of Cambodia, Cambodian army forces under the command of General Lon Nol overthrew the government. \n\nFearing the establishment of a far-right dictatorship furiously opposed to the North Vietnamese political agenda, the North Vietnamese army began heavily supplying the Khmer Rouge, making them far more powerful within Cambodia. In response to increased Khmer Rouge and Viet Cong control over Eastern Cambodia, the US greatly intensified their military operations in Cambodia. These campaigns inadvertently fueled grassroots support for the Khmer Rouge. Viet Cong attacks on Cambodians also fueled support for the Khmer Rouge, as civilians directed their hatred of the Viet Cong at the Vietnamese people in general, as well as the Cambodian army for failing to quell the violence.\n\nThe Cambodian Republic continued to weaken during the early 1970s. Infrastructure crumbled, the economy collapsed, and food prices skyrocketted. The capital of Phnom Penh was virtually surrounded in 1974, and fell in April of 1975. The Khmer Rouge seized control of Cambodia, and the Cambodian Genocide began.\n","created_utc":1520909934,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"[deleted]","body":"I'm not an anarchist and don't come out of that milieu. But the best counter-argument I've heard is that when the fascists demobilize, so will antifa. Its purpose is really not to win over public opinion but to disrupt fascists as they try to organize, like throwing a monkeywrench into the machinery. This process puts the fascists under pressure and gets them to expose their true selves. They lash out, get emotional, and start blaming each other for their failures. The fascist groups blow up.\n\nAntifa is (and should be) more defined by what it's against than what it's for, and antifa groups that try to incorporate a particular left-wing political tendency (even though most in the U.S. are anarchists) often run into problems with sectarian issues that can cause infighting. When doing antifascist work, it's best to establish some clear, firm ground rules based on mutual respect but to leave the major political differences aside.\n\nWhen right-wingers say \"both sides are equally bad,\" I find that encouraging actually. It means they're adopting a centrist position instead of a sympathetic position to neo-Nazis and such. Or at least, a less sympathetic position. They've moved slightly to our position a bit. But trying to convert them into full-blown antifascists is generally reaching too far.\n\nAs far as staying motivated, being unmotivated makes the fascists' job easier. Don't let them put you down without a fight. Fascists have historically seized power by escalating rapidly to extreme violence before society can adapt. Charlottesville for them was the culmination of several years of organizing, recruiting and radicalizing -- in an attempt to display power, which they believe is necessary before the masses of sympathizers out there (which they believe exist) can get over their reservations and join them. Basically, the fascists wanted to lower the barriers of entry for people, which can be quite high socially.

{"author":"doomsdayprophecy","body":"Privilege actually exists and is a result of widespread oppression. If white people can't handle that much then that's part of the problem, not something that we should cater to.\n\nI understand that the term \"privilege\" is often abused and exaggerated. For example, white people who smoke weed are less likely to be arrested, less likely to be convicted, and less likely to get a long jail sentence. But I wouldn't consider this a \"privilege\". It's more that white people are less oppressed than non-whites.\n\nHowever, there are MANY important and glaring cases of privilege. White people are certainly privileged in terms of wealth over non-whites. Consider Belgium for example. It's a rich, secure state whose [wealth was created](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfYC7m4cULE) and still maintained almost entirely by brutally exploiting africans. Perhaps some Belgians have also suffered from these racist institutions, but does that mean Belgians aren't generally privileged over the Congolese? Of course not. The Belgians are privileged AF. It's not much different with blacks or natives in the Americas. It's ahistorical and probably racist to deny this reality. \n\nI also doubt that most white people would be better off without racism. White people generally don't want reparations. The system is rigged against non-whites ever \"catching up\". Whom would the Global South exploit to achieve that level of wealth? Could the planet sustain the levels of Belgian consumption worldwide? It can't even sustain current levels of consumption. \n\nOf course it would be great if capitalism and racism were smashed, but I don't think that's going to be possible until people realistically consider history and present reality.

It's critical to understand just how important that kind of conspiratorial thinking is to the alt-right.\n\nThere are strong parallels with anti-Semitism and how people deal with the cognitive dissonance between the twin ideas of \"Jews are inferior/subhuman\" and \"Jews run the world.\" One concept undermines the other but you can make them work if you employ a *highly* irrational, conspiratorial worldview.\n\nIf you look at a lot of chatter among the alt-right they see conspiracies fucking everywhere. It's part of why people like Alex Jones are so popular among the alt-right and fash in general; they want someone who will brainstorm with/for them and develop these theories, no matter how outlandish and senseless, to allow them to keep their worldview alive.\n\nYou need these conspiracies or else your worldview is crushed under it's own unsupportable weight. It also provides a sense of superiority and smugness to be able to say \"*I* know the truth! You can't fool me! I see through your lies!\" \n\nThe problem is this becomes a vicious cycle that literally poisons your ability to hear other people. \n\nWhen you start convincing yourself that the people who purport to have answers are lying to you then you start getting to a point where you start questioning everything that conflicts with your understanding of the world. Someone tells you something and you dislike it you start to be more and more able to construct elaborate theories about why it is that way.\n\nAfter a while you can literally restructure reality in any way you see fit. Evidence that disputes your worldview actually strengthens it because you can classify it as a plot by the evil forces to maintain control and thus just more evidence that you're right. You've effectively created a mental block against rationality that only gets stronger the more its challenged.\n\nThis goes together with a lot of the misogyny and incel mentality of much of the alt-right and other neo-nazi groups; \"I am not wrong, you are. I know the truth. I understand what's going on. You are sheep.\" When you have both a conspiratorial mindset *and* believe that you are among the select few that can actually understand these conspiracies as well as point them out then you are not going to accept any sort of genuine feedback from another human being.\n\nSomeone saying \"Please stop referring to me as \"bitch\" doesn't *really* care about being insulted, she's just trying to make you feel guilty so she can manipulate you easier!\n\nWhen someone says \"no\" when you put your hand down their pants, they *really* mean yes, they just think they mean no because they don't want to seem \"easy.\"\n\nSeriously, if you've got a strong stomach, read through T_D or a lot of the Incel stuff. It's rife with conspiracy and paranoia because without that mindset these worldviews literally cannot function.\n\nWith regard to antifa, they can easily say that antifa is \"winning\" because they get help from media, from the rich, from the police, etc. Scroll through the comment section on that video. Literally the third comment from the top (at time of writing) is:\n\n&gt;The government runs \"antifa\" Richard. For a smart guy, you can be ridiculously naive sometime. The government uses these groups to monitor, control, and stifle political groups throughout the US.\n\n","created_utc":1520927065,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"viva1831","body":"So, the difference between countries and continents isn't quite the same as racism within countries, granted. It's linked, but it isn't the same.\n\nThe wealth of empire DIDN'T trickle down at first. At first it WAS only the rich people in white countries that got the money back.\n\nPeople got access to it because they fought for it. The reason for the imbalance in wealth nowadays is different conditions. The richest people in the world lived in Europe (and now the USA too). They need some stability to function, so it was easier to buy people off and give in to a few of their demands. Most African countries were actually more profitable when unstable, and still are today, so the rich still are far more willing to ruthlessly crush any dissent.\n\nI mean, would you say a black english person has privilege over someone who lives in the Congo? They've got far more access to wealth after all. That's WHY you have economic migration! So maybe white privilege isn't the best way to describe it - national privilege, or European privilege maybe.\n\nEmpire and race is part of the story - but as I've explained above it's not the whole of it. To say that working class white Europeans just have wealth \"because of racism\" erases centuries of struggle where people fought and organised, and many were tourtured and killed, to get enough to survive. Going back in time, people achieved this against all the odds - working 12 hour days, looking after giant families, with barely two pennies to rub together and no civil liberties or healthcare or education.\n\n&gt; White people generally don't want reparations\n\nMany of my ancestors were farm labourers with no land and living in poverty. None of them volunteered to fight the empire's wars (and the empire's wars have fucked us over in many ways). I have no income at all atm. What am I supposed to pay reparations for, and what am I supposed to pay them with?

{"author":"ian_winters","body":"Yeah, I saw them accusing North Korean detractors of \"orientalism.\" If they believe that communism as implemented by Koreans is naturally and necessarily a theocratic dictatorship, then I suggest that they have some errant views of the Korean worker's revolutionary potential. Casting them as inscrutably foreign is made no less \"orientalist\" by excusing their tyrants in the process; they merely seize liberal high ground by deeming Koreans as unknowable yet accepted by enlightened white \"comrades.\" Apparently \"*Full* Communism\" is defined as \"appealing to the present state of things.\"\n\nOpposing North Korea's destruction/invasion by the United States is perfectly reasonable; American imperialism is always bad, and even incidental positive outcomes are enormously overshadowed by American interests (i.e. the death of one dictator has huge collateral damage, and leads to the installation of an American puppet, whose resistance is the justification for more imperialism).

It's built into the framework.\n- Communities, such as /r/anarchism, are a frequently attacked target from fascists, trolls, and state-communists. Removing bad faith actors, moderators would be unnecessary.\n- Anarchist communities throughout history, have decided on certain standards in which people must apply. Mostly, don't be an asshole. People have specialties to solve these issues. Sanitation workers clean up people's shit. Cooks, well, cook food. These are not authoritarian social relationships, they're just social relationships.\n- Within social relationships there exist the opportunity for those occupations/specialties to develop into longer-term or truly existing hierarchies and authorities. This requires a check by a community to prevent that from happening. The !kung will use mocking, social exclusion, to prevent some hierarchies from forming. Indigenous zapatisitas use rotating delegations of coordinators (changed weekly to monthly). Anarchist/organizer groups in the US use facilitators to focus on moving through the agenda, making sure people are taking up too much air space, or taking too little. \n- Of the dozens of issues with anarchist groups, moderators are literally the least important issue out there.","created_utc":1520947871,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Nevertheless, much against its will, it inherited the German revolution. This was made possible to a large extent by the help of Russia, which did its share in killing off the German council movement. The power which had fallen into the lap of Social Democracy was used for nothing. The Social Democracy simply renewed its old class collaboration policy, satisfied with sharing power over the workers with the bourgeoisie in the reconstruction period of capitalism. The German radical workers countered this betrayal with the slogan, \u2018No compromise with the counter revolution\u2019. Here was a concrete case, a specific situation, demanding a clear decision. Lenin, unable to recognize the real issues at stake, made from this concrete specific question a general problem. With the air of a general and the infallibility of a cardinal, he tried to persuade the ultra-lefts that compromises with political opponents under all conditions are a revolutionary duty. If today one reads those passages in Lenin\u2019s pamphlet dealing with compromises, one is inclined to compare Lenin\u2019s remarks in 1920 with Stalin\u2019s present policy of compromises. There is not one deadly sin of Bolshevik theory which did not become Bolshevistic reality under Lenin.\n\nAccording to Lenin, the ultra-lefts should have been willing to sign the Treaty of Versailles. However, the Communist Party, still in accordance with Lenin, made a compromise and protested against the Versailles Treaty in collaboration with the Hitlerites. The \u2018National bolshevism\u2019 propagandized in 1919 in Germany by the left-winger Lauffenberg was in Lenin\u2019s opinion \u2018an absurdity crying to heaven\u2019. But Radek and the Communist Party-\u2014again in accordance with Lenin\u2019s principle\u2014concluded a compromise with German Nationalism, and protested against the occupation of the Ruhr basin and celebrated the national hero Schlageter. The League of Nations was, in Lenin\u2019s own words, \u2018a band of capitalist robbers and bandits\u2019, whom the workers could only fight to the bitter end. However, Stalin\u2014in accordance with Lenin\u2019s tactics\u2014made a compromise with these very same bandits, and the USSR entered the League. The concept \u2018folk\u2019 or \u2018People\u2019 is in Lenin\u2019s opinion a criminal concession to the counterrevolutionary ideology of the petty bourgeoisie. This did not hinder the Leninists, Stalin and Dimitrov, from making a compromise with the petty bourgeoisie in order to launch the freakish \u2018Peoples Front\u2019 movement. For Lenin, imperialism was the greatest enemy of the world proletariat, and against it all forces had to be mobilized. But Stalin, again in true Leninist fashion, is quite busy with cooking up an alliance with Hitler\u2019s imperialism. Is it necessary to offer more examples? **Historical experience teaches that all compromises between revolution and counterrevolution can serve only the latter.** They lead only to the bankruptcy of the revolutionary movement. All policy of compromise is a policy of bankruptcy. What began as a mere compromise with the German Social Democracy found its end in Hitler. What Lenin justified as a necessary compromise found its end in Stalin. In diagnosing revolutionary non-compromise as \u2018An Infantile Disease of Communism\u2019, Lenin was suffering from the old age disease of opportunism, of pseudo communism","created_utc":1520963835,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Or would farms be seized of the farmers by the community and run by them?  \n\n&gt;You just described a state without calling it a state.  \n\nNo I didn't, anyone living in the village who does not wish to be introduced into the communal protection would be free to choose not to. A state would require that they received protection.  \n\n\n&gt;Because it provides the class who owns all stuff the resources (produced by labor) necessary to entrench their privileged social position at the expense of the mass of people.  \n\nIf we go back to the house situation I mentioned earlier, I pay some willing contractors a set fee to help me build a house. No-one is forcing them to take the deal. With there help I built a big beautiful house, pay them and say bye. Who does the house belong too now? Me surely, because I took all the risks building the house.  \nIf you were to go ahead and remove the profit incentive, no-more houses would be build.  \n\nAll your other points are very valid and I agree with them.\n\n\n\n\n","created_utc":1520978245,"score":-1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

So in an anarchist society majority cannot dominate minority without willingness of the minority. Even if that minority is one single individual. That is what anarchy is.

Unless you want to be some unrealistic idealist who thinks they can live in society but scoff at it when its entirely penetrated by unjust hierarchies this is just empty rhetoric. If you can find a way to get the state to say stop breaking up a striking action that's not unjust. If you can get he state to stop making it illegal to strike that's not unjust.\n\nAnd frankly I don't give two shits about the injustice of the state \"governing\" a capitalist if it lessens the suffering of others that are subject to him, or the mistreatment of this system.

{"author":"a_lynnk_to_the_past","body":"Right-wing political theorists have changed the definition of words in certain areas which makes discussion between socialists and everyone else problematic. Most importantly, capitalism is not a free market. And I mean that in the sense of definition, not a polemic about capitalism being un-free. Capitalism, as used historically and by socialists now, refers to the mode of production centered on the purchase of wage labour by capitalists to drive their accumulation of capital. Capitalism is one of many modes of production with a market and so should not be equated with markets in general. In fact, there are anti-capitalist free-market socialists.\n\n&gt; How is capitalism composed of oppressive hierarchies?\n\nWage labour is an inherent part of capitalism and we see the relationship of capitalists, bosses, etc. to the workers as an oppressive one.\n\nThe economic argument is that capital accumulation only happens because workers are paid the value of their labour not the value of what they create with that labour. This surplus value is taken by the capitalist who is only able to do so because they own the means of production. This is economic exploitation due to the monopoly on capital and means of production.\n\nThe political argument is that actually existing capitalism is so bound up with the state that capitalists have an overbearing amount of political power. What ancaps criticize as \"state capitalism\" is the situation that actual capitalists want because it ensures their profits.\n\nThe most important argument to me is that wage labour, and therefore the hierarchical authority of boss-worker, reduces autonomy in the economic sphere. I prefer working cooperatively as equals more than having to follow orders, or giving them. To govern myself during working hours, not to be a rented slave. Capitalism and private property uphold this situation and so I want to destroy them.\n\nTo be autonomous we need our property which means we need the things we use daily to be actually under our power. \"Property is freedom\" as Proudhon wrote but the current state of property only guarantees autonomy to the few. The alternative is a system of ownership based on use and possession rather than a permanent legal title. Not to get rid of property or give it to the phantasm of society, but to ensure all have property.\n\n&gt; I remember being told that under communism, peoples jobs were chosen for them.\n\nWe don't support that because anarchists are _libertarian_ socialists, not authoritarian ones. People often conflate marxism (especially marxism-leninism) with communism.","created_utc":1520982682,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I presume that the libertarians there were protesting against the statue being taken down because of complaints. \n\nThat statue, along with *so many* others, was built in the early 1900s, a full *fifty* years or more *after* the Civil War, specifically to intimidate black people. The history argument doesn't hold water.\n\n&gt;Oh yes that would obviously be an act of aggression and punching them would be justified.\n\nGlad you understand.\n\n&gt;However, in most of the nazi punching videos I have seen, the Nazi is just having polite discourse and debate with others, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql7BaOrTvYA\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7wHHRbjnsU\nDo you think these attacks are morally justifiable? I am very interested in your answer. \n\nRichard Spencer isn't an innocent person. He constantly advocates for \"peaceful ethnic cleansing\" in order to bring about a white ethnostate. That is blatantly impossible to do without killing *millions*, because minorities aren't going to leave their homes just because white people don't want to see someone with darker skin than David Hasselhoff.\n\nAlso keep in mind that Nazis aren't genuinely interested in polite discourse and debate. They constantly use logical fallacies, ad hominems, and outright *lies* to get their point across, because they know that screaming about the blacks openly isn't in vogue (although it's quickly coming back). They pose a direct, existential threat to LGBT+ people, minorities, and anyone to the left of Mussolini. [This is literally a comedy show, but it actually pretty accurately describes how they operate](https://youtu.be/02vuSnVF8sU?t=2m33s).\n\nIn addition, the Nazi in the second link was harassing someone, so he's not innocent either.\n\nSo yes, those are morally justifiable, because if they had the power they would hurt people I care about.\n\n&gt;Do you not think that people should be fiscally responsible for their own actions?\n\nThe thing is, a lot of rich people *don't* face consequences (fiscally or otherwise), and when they do they're very rarely the consequences that everyone else faces. Martin Shkreli got seven years in prison for securities fraud (i.e. ripping off other rich people) instead of the objectively more heinous act of raising the price of an essential drug to completely unaffordable levels. That was completely legal.\n\nA kid can go to prison for 40 years for selling marijuana on the street.\n\n&gt;People are smart enough to not need a parent state to order them to commit actions that are 'good' for them.\n\nThis is where we agree. However, capitalism doesn't work in a vacuum. If the state vanishes tomorrow, along with all the capital that the state has, I'd bet my left pinky toe that corporations would fill the void, since they have the vast majority of the resources. I know that your vision involves a lot of mom and pop shops and local businesses, and that *might* happen for a little bit, but given enough time those businesses would combine into gargantuan monstrosities of corporations, because nobody's around to tell them that they can't, and they can make more money if they pool resources.\n\nIf a corporation thinks they can get away with something heinous that'll make them a lot of money, they'll do it, and that is based on *so many* examples. That's why a lot of manufacturing is based in China, because of the incredibly low wages and lax regulations. Chinese iPhone factories have *suicide nets* in the stairwells to catch jumpers.

Obviously you can take vacations and whatnot, but you cannot claim to own a field that you haven't worked in so many years. A lot of libertarian socialists are market anarchists (like myself) and would say you can keep the money you earn as well.\n\nIf you can work a certain amount of land by yourself that's fine, but a libertarian socialist would not think it ethical to exploit workers. You wouldn't have \"employees\" but rather other farmers who owned the means of production (the farm and farming equipment) alongside you. I personally think money is fine, but there is a lot of disagreement there. In my view, and a lot of other market anarchists, you can make money, and the cooperative or commune or whatever collectively owns the farm can even make a profit, but the key is this profit isn't funneled upwards towards CEOs or board-members. It is divided among workers or reinvested into the business.","created_utc":1520987364,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

This kind of essentialism is pretty nonsensical and seems only applicable to privileged people in the first world who face no real insecurity or people of very good health in societies that already provide basically universal protection... so they can bypass the need to be ideologically pure and not have to complain that they don't have universal health care.\n\nI think I'm done here.","created_utc":1521011037,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

As far as well-recorded historical examples go, there's Catalonia in the spanish civil war as you mentioned, the Paris commune of 1871, the Ukrainian free territory (and the Cossacks in the pre-modern period). Less documented -but still researchable- examples might include some intentionally stateless highland communities in the southeast-asian region James Scott refers to as Zomia, as well as the English Diggers and Burrowers movement, the late Roman Bagaudae, perhaps some of the many peasant revolutions in Chinese history or the Mazdakites and Khurramites in Persia. There are countless other instances of communities living outside, on the fringes, and within the liminal spaces of state societies. I'd argue that includes a huge range of communities that have been largely ignored by academics. A lot of hobos are practicing anarchists. There are anarchic elements to the communal relationships formed in every small village or urban tenement. \nAnarchy can be expressed through explicit rejection of the state, through informal exit strategies and bargaining, but also through the implicit formation of non-hierarchical relationships in various ways.\n\nIf you want to look at contemporary cases of more structured social projects with anarchic tendencies and roots, look at the Zapatistas in Chiapas, Rojava in the upper fertile crescent, and squats like Exarcheia in Athens.

No need to assume that i have the most evil point of view or intention (which seems to be the trend if you do not subscribe to all the modern ideas in the identity politics doctrine). \n\nI believe sometimes people are not believed when they are sexual assaulted, however i think the ideas around 'rape culture' assumes people should automatically believe (i support take seriously position) someone, ignoring the possibility they are lying about it, and or they are in a psychosis or any of the other possibilities. Reality is not some black and white thing and reality exist in the particular not the general. \n\nI believe racism and sexism, are bad, when people are discriminated against on those grounds. I believe the oppressor vs oppressed mindset, borrowed from marxism, of whites vs blacks and men vs women, means that people's group identity trumps their individualism. White people and black people are individuals where the differences between those members in those groups is great than the difference between groups. The ideas of white priviledge assume automatic guilt and privilege on just one measurement while ignoring all the other traits of that person, e.g. that the person may be homeless, or hardworking or beaten as a kid or what ever. I also believe these leads activist to treat people in the 'oppressed' group as victims as opposed as individuals, and become sychophantic towards them, in an attempt to relieve themselves of their own guilty of white priviledge. It reminds me of the madness of the Mao's cultural revolution. \n\nI believe identity politics doesnt fight racism or sexism, is just creates other forms of it.

Rape culture is not believing the victim because they could be lying about it. So fewer victims step out because they are likely to not be believed. Trying to cause distrust of rape victims is a method to take power away from rape victims.\n\nFor both men and women that have been victims of rape, they do not report it because they don't think anyone will believe them. Or if people do believe them, then it will turn others against them. By fighting to keep disbelieving victims, you are disempowering them.\n\n&gt; The ideas of white priviledge assume automatic guilt\n\nNot really. Acknowledging white privilege doesn't assume guilt. It's admitting that there is a structural advantage granted to white people that disadvantaged people cannot access. Stuff like shorter jail terms for white people than black people. Stuff like racist housing policies that we're still seeing the impacts of to this day.\n\nTalking about white privilege isn't meant to be repaid with white guilt. It's meant to deconstruct whiteness.\n\nIf you think people are trying to make you feel guilty for being white, then you need to step back and look at what's actually going on. They're trying to make you recognize the structural powers that allow for one group to have advantages over another.\n\nAnd yeah, that requires putting an end to the individualist narrative that the individual is the ultimate arbiter of truth. Individualism ignores collective struggles. Since the individual is ultimate arbiter of truth, and they don't experience structural racism, bigotry, or sexism then they become separated from people actually experiencing them. In this way, individualism weakens the individual because when one person experiences injustice that others do not, they are silenced as their experiences are not a part of the individualist narrative.\n\nInstead we should seek a consensus on a shared reality. Rather than rely on an individual to fully know their world based only on their lonely view, we should seek to arrive a collective understanding of the world. This is how the scientific method works. We arrive at conclusions about the nature of reality by collective experimental consensus. This empowers an individual as their experiences are no longer silenced.\n\nWhere individualism believes \"I don't experience privilege because I've had a hard life,\" collectivism arrives at a consensus that privilege exists because groups as a whole experience it. \n\nFollowing an individualist narrative just to disbelieve racism, rape victims, privilege, etc. is often not welcome in leftist spaces because that narrative silences those that are disadvantaged, victimized, and oppressed.\n\nAnd note that individualism (the idea that the individual is the ultimate arbiter of truth) is different from individuality (the idea that we're different people with different experiences, tastes, desires, and needs).","created_utc":1521022762,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

We live in an era of rage, not imbecility. That rage started in the \"former colonies\" over the fact that they were being fucked over by the so-called West, then moved into the West as economic conditions began to stagnate and decline for the vast majority of the population. Decades of promises of change (in the U.S. here - Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama) with nothing to show for it, massive corporate profits with tax cuts and welfare cuts, the bald-faced mission of the ruling elites to hoard as much for themselves as they can gave way to rage. People withdrawing from the electoral system because it doesn't change shit for them, and others voting for Bernie, Brexit, Corbin, etc because they at least give a concrete vision for changing how things are going. Trump, too, as much as a con-man as he is, promised a boldly different vision of what things could be like.\n\nAnd so people voted for them. Settled for Trump when Bernie wasn't available. One of the driving forces in Bernie's campaign was scrapping the TPP and re-negotiating NAFTA. Ditto Trump, who at this point has followed through with one of those promises and is - as far as I can tell - working hard to blow up the second. I don't trust Trump and what he'll replace it with, but it's not stupidity that got people to vote for Brexit, or Trump. It's rage over how much the current system is fucking them.\n\nThe columnist here doesn't refer to Brexit directly - but does he think Brexit was the result of stupidity? Because considering the neoliberal policy edicts coming from the EU central bureaucracy, Brexit was not a bad idea, in the long-term. So long as the EU pursues a neoliberal vision of how the world should be arranged, it is a threat to working people. The pro-Brexit figureheads may have been reactionary fucks, but people forget that Corbyn and the left in the UK didn't really fight against Brexit hard...because the EU is a threat to the workers' project.","created_utc":1521039650,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Our so called leaders see us nothing more than a number no doubt. These small acts of vandalism aren't going to change a thing. If anything you guys just fattened the pockets of the insurance companies to repair the damage done. So once again the elites are laughing there asses off at you. They are too powerful to bring down unless you plan something massive and are willing to die or go to jail for a long time. Most are not willing to die or go to jail which is why most people eventually fall in line. You don't see a lot of older anarchists because when most reach a certain age they realize the battle cannot be won. Very sad but very true.

Many women fear saying anything if they feel alone because you can't investigate a crime that doesn't leave physical evidence.\n\n&gt; my objections are based on my understanding on the legal system and why innocent until proven guilty is the lessor evil than guilty till proven innocent.\n\nAssuming \"unbelievable until overwhelmingly corroborated\" is the same as assuming guilty until proven innocent. You are assuming that the victim is guilty of lying about being raped.\n\n&gt; I believe the individual shouldnt be sacificed for the collective. as that is dangerous as hell e.g. gulags and concentration camps.\n\nGulags and concentration camps are not collectivist. They are the results of an individualist thought leader constructing a narrative (e.g. \"Jews are to blame for our misfortune.\") and enforcing their will upon a group. This is individualism as truth is asserted as objective dogma. Collectivism works against thought leaders though because a thought leader cannot arrive at collective consensus alone. Only a collective can arrive at consensus.\n\nAgain, collectivism empowers the individual by including their experiences in the consensus of our view on reality. If a scientist develops some experiment that disproves some prediction in general relativity, then that becomes a part of our collective consensus about the nature of reality. Under individualism, a thought leader can push their theory into the public eye based purely on their authority, regardless of experimental data or group consensus.\n\n&gt; Are you aware that way identity politics leads to people making assumptions about people...mansplaining...whitesplaining.\n\nThis is pretty complicated. Some men explain themselves over a woman's issues and silence the problems the woman has. Some white people similarly erase black discrimination. Other times people use the stereotype that men explain over a problem a woman has to silence men. I don't think the solution for this is to erase identity politics (the idea that identities have valid struggles to overcome to achieve social equality) because women are still disadvantaged, black people still experience systemic racism, men still experience a culture that enforces toxic masculinity upon them.\n\nEnding identity politics means erasing the collective struggles groups under those identities experience and placing the onus on the individual to overcome societal issues.\n\n&gt; not automatically believing a rape victim when one isnt quailified to judge doesnt mean you disbelieve them\n\nNot believing is disbelieving. Taking them seriously means believing them.\n\n&gt; 'And note that individualism (the idea that the individual is the ultimate arbiter of truth)\" i would say post modernism does that, e.g. everything is subjective, not individualism.\n\nIndividualism developed out of modernism. Modernism posits that there is an objective truth and that it's up to the individual to search for it. Combined with the marketplace of ideas, thought leaders then became the peddlers of truth.\n\nPostmodernism puts an end to objective truth and is where collectivism developed. Rather than rely on an individualistic search for objectivity, we need to collectivize our view of reality to arrive at a consensus. If it is up to the individual to discover truth in a world without objectivity, then they will be relying on an incomplete narrative built from their biases and incomplete views.","created_utc":1521069006,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"PM_ME_UR__RECIPES","body":"&gt;Who investigates this and prosecutes the offender?\n\nAs far as investigation goes, giving a select few people a shared monopoly on the use of violence won't help an investigation. Giving someone the means and the authority to kill and injure as they please while on \"duty\" does absolutely nothing in helping to rehabilitate a murderer, or to repair the damages caused by crime. \n\nAs far as prosecution goes, I think that this is a misguided way of looking at the problem of violent incidents within a community. As you pointed out, instances of violence always have some reason behind them, whether or not they are somehow tied to exploitation, and simply prosecuting every violent person according to the perceived magnitude of their violence doesn't address whatever motivated them to be violent in the first place. Maybe they suffer from some mental health issue and aren't receiving adequate care. Maybe they are themselves the victims of violence elsewhere and don't know how to deal with the trauma in any other way. \n\nI want to be clear here: I'm not saying that nothing should be done to try and prevent crime, or to try and deal with the aftermath of crime, but the way most societies today deal with the problem are ineffective at best, and cause more crime at worst, and the police being the manifestation of the state's  monopoly on violence are a part of that problem.

{"author":"ThePeaceReport","body":"The introduction is solid. \nRobert Graham (author) states the book is about the beginning of the \"anarchist movement\", and he makes clear the difference between someone saying they're an anarchist versus ideas that turn into action (movement). Bao JinYan 300 BCE said, \"Neither Lord Nor Subject\", but Graham begs the question \"what is an anarchist\". Just claiming to be one? Or does anarchism actually manifest itself when ideas turn into action as well as establishing a clear set of principles that describe that idea. \n\nSo anarchism really begins at the Paris Commune and the \"antiauthoritarians\". He argues that the antiauthoritarian wing (aka anarchists) of the International (1st) can be seen as a precursor to anarchism (the movement). Leading the antiauthoritarian wing was Bakunin who set forth 6 primary grounds for disguising his anarchism from the views of his opponents:\n1. AntiAuthoritarianism\n2. AntiStatism\n3. AntiParliamentarianism\n4. Federalism \n5. Libertarianism \n6. Social Revolution\n\nGraham also lays out the differences between Proudhan and Bakunin, nonviolence vs violence as strategies to achieve the same end. But both nonviolence/violence believed in direct action to achieve the same goal: anarchism. ","created_utc":1521070027,"score":5,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

It generally views patriarchy and traditional gender rules as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by decentralized free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of class conflict and the anarchist struggle against the state and capitalism. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1521087874,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

It isn't an assumption, it's something we've seen over and over.\n\n&gt; Police help people all the time and investigate things...\n\nExcept in the case of rape there is often no traceable evidence, the police don't help, and victims will straight up be ignored.\n\nIn several cases the police actually investigate the person reporting and prosecuted them for lying. One woman was pressured into recanting and was fined $500, had to seek mental health counseling, and went on probation for a year. Two years later a serial rapist was arrested and had photos proving he raped the woman. \n\nThat isn't a unique case. There are several rape victims that get prosecuted for lying when evidence later comes out that backs up their claims. That is what rape culture is. Doubt about being raped is built into the system and pressures victims into silence or punishes them for speaking.\n\n80% of victims of sexual assault remain silent because there is a culture of disbelieving and dismissing their claims.\n\nWhen people come out about being raped by someone in the public eye, they are lambasted online, their stories are dismissed, and they may find themselves prosecuted for libel.\n\nWhen you go into an investigation doubting the victim then you are searching for reasons to dismiss the case.\n\nThe solution to all this is to start by believing.

{"author":"SirBrendantheBold","body":"Thank you very much for taking the time to write this. Every Marxist and anarchist knows full-well how alienating living in a capitalism can be. It is by design that we feel useless and isolated. So any honest discussion on subjects like this are essential if for no other reason than to remind us that we're not alone in it.\n\n\nI don't use any of the social media you've mentioned except for Reddit. This is primarily because I find them degrading. I'm twenty-eight by the way so I'm part of the younger pups. However I also don't have a negative view of the social media. I mean, obviously the fact that we're being monitored is irritating but it is defeated largely by simply reminding people to read up on security culture. The world changes but we can always adapt with it.\n\nThe more worrying topic is the 'likes'. There's a concerning similarity to the 'Skinner Box' in which conformity of ideas or attitudes are unconsciously imposed by the natural human desire to be accepted. Fortunately anarchists are typically resilient to this type of pressure-- at least we hope so. Still, it's a problem. \n\nUltimately though these are also positive aspects that I don't think we should ignore. The internet and its massive communities allow us to project our voices and ideas into the homes of the atomized and isolated individual. People who, for a variety of reasons, might otherwise not be able to participate are suddenly capable of joining discussions and action. Anarchism, as a radical political movement, has unfortunately been isolated largely only to radical members. This medium however allows for appeal and introduction to a much larger or less convinced membership. \n\nIt also allows non-committal interest to be opened up.Anyone who even slightly wants to learn about the movement can now have the entirety of anarchist literature and diverse anarchist discussion available to them from the comfort of their bed. The introduction factor is its stronger point.  As an internationalist movement being less limited by geographical barriers to solidarity and discussion is also a pretty powerful advantage. Finally, our ability to play interlocutor and disrupt discussions of other groups like fascist organisations is also kinda neat.\n\nI've been involved in radical politics for over a decade. But I fell away from it for a while while I tried to focus on my individual life and needs. These subreddits have reintroduced me to the community and acted as a gateway to more meaningful participation that I've been recently looking into. So I figure if it can do that for me, it has to at least have some positive value.\n\nEither way, thank you for being so honest and starting up the dialogue. The anarchist bookstores and organisations are still very much alive and seem to be expanding in their membership.

Thankfully, in a number of places, those mobs we're eventually forced to enact democracy as one of their rules in order to prevent the working class from...well... killing them all. But that is a placation measure that still affords the rich and powerful capitalist class a degree of power while keeping the working class represented *enough* to not openly revolt.\n\nAnarchists want to REMOVE mob rule entirely. By instituting a system with a founding principle of completely hierarchy-free society, with enough checks and balances within it to prevent the rise of a mob rule.

Your \"third choice between believe and not believing\" is awfully close to \"not believing.\" Which means rape victims will still be silenced.\n\nWhen victims don't have to be silent out of fear of not being believed, out of fear of backlash from coming out, we can work against the culture that perpetuates sexual assault.\n\n&gt; it's taboo in the far left to advocate anything different\n\nBecause not believing silences victims. I've explained this several times. I've shown you how a culture that intends to not trust the victim silences the victim. Police literally look for signs that the victim is lying based on minor inaccuracies in their recounting of events (that the police then report as major problems in their report), based on their emotional state (if you don't look too upset to them then they won't believe you've been raped), and based on anything else. \n\nPeople can go through the motions that make it look like they're taking it seriously, yet the facts remain: rape victims that come out are not believed and that silences other rape victims, which helps perpetuate a culture of rape as 80% of victims remain silent.\n\n&gt; which again is a problem in and of its self.\n\nGo keep chasing your individualist narrative, but we're going to reject it because we have a consensus on this.

{"author":"a_lynnk_to_the_past","body":"Whenever I read calls for gender abolition I'm left wondering, what would a future without gender actually look like? I cannot imagine one. Abolishing gender also means abolishing sex because that's simply gendering of the body. To get rid of sex means avoiding categorization based on physical attributes. Let's look at a simplistic sex system that some people hold: male = penis, female = vagina, and we force everyone else to fit. Getting rid of this system requires replacing it with another (which you reject) or replacing it with nothing. But how is it possible to replace it with nothing? Getting rid of the labels doesn't change anything because we can still conceptualize groups based on genitals. So we must rid ourselves of the capability to categorize people based on a certain physical characteristic. How?\n\nTo me the issue is not the existence of categorization but that these categories have social ramifications. They have an essentialist meaning rather than being neutral descriptions. For example, having bright green hair may result in being judged negatively, as a punk or something. Following the logic of gender abolition we should abolish the system of categorization by hair colour. Therefore we would render unintelligible phrases like \"green haired person\". Impossible, and I think not desirable. Rather we should disarm the categorization, make it harmless, so that \"green haired person\" has no underlying meaning.","created_utc":1521154512,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

First of all, by abandoning that horrible pretension that just because the Other disagrees with our point of view, they have nothing valid to offer. It follows from this that we recognize different people will prefer to be active in different ways, and in fact different temperaments draw people towards different anarchist tendencies before theory ever comes into it. Some people will never want to go to your boring meetings or organize in their workplace (they won\u2019t even want to have a workplace). Some people will never want to set foot in your nasty-assed squat or live in fear that the state will take away their kids because of the lifestyle of the parents (or they won\u2019t even want to subject their kids to the stress of a life of constant warfare). And guess what? That\u2019s fine and natural. If. If we can cover each other\u2019s backs. Above ground organizers who build support for the insurrectionists, who stand by those masked terrorists instead of denouncing them, will create a stronger movement. Insurrectionists who carry out the waves of sabotage the organizers are too exposed to call for, who keep in touch with the outside world and also keep the organizers honest and aware of the broader picture, the horizon of possibility, will create a stronger movement. Organizationalists who exclude the insurrectionists help them isolate themselves. Insurrectionists who see the organizers as the enemy help them recuperate the struggle. These are self-fulfilling prophecies. Insurrectionists can be helped by the movement-building and social resources of the organizationalists, who in turn can be helped by the more radical perspective and sometimes stronger tactics, the dreams put into practice, of the insurrectionists.\n&gt;\n&gt; ([Peter Gelderloos, \"Insurrection vs. Organization\"](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-insurrection-vs-organization))","created_utc":1521160965,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

You are likely just confusing the concept of communism (a classless and stateless society) and the old authoritarian Communist parties (Lenin, Mao, Stalin, Trotsky, etc). It is a common mistake. \n\nSee, these parties called themselves \"Communists\" because their philosophy was that their authoritarian system had the goal of creating a communist society. Now, even at the time, this caused them to come into conflict with anarchists who also wanted a communist society, because anarchists (both then and now) didn't think that an authoritarian system would ever create a communist society, and that it would just become a new version of tyranny and exploitation, but with different oligarchs, red flags and revolutionary rhetoric ([Fucking called that shit](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/247/124/c5a.jpg)). \n\nSo, to answer your question -- no, this sub, absolutely rejects the authoritarian philosophy of the old Communist parties -- as did the old anarchists who were contemporaries to those so called Communist parties.

Like yeah, voting takes just a few minutes and it doesn't have to be a primary way of engaing in politics, I entirely understand this. But the reality is that it creates little change and is a symbolic action. I live in a winner takes all state, so it doesn't matter in a pragmatic sense. I do engage in local politics because it's possible to create immediate change and have a really good understanding of the in-depth implications of the actions, which no matter the good intentions you simply don't understand the needs of the people or land in a geographic space that you don't live and are often led to vote ideologically rather than contextually and this is really bad. This is especially important for ecological issues where I live, resisting increased commercialisation and commodification of our already limited water. \n\nHowever, I don't agree with mass systems of organization. I don't believe in an anarchist province, or anything thats coordinated on a scale as large as a nation. It's impersonal and invokes the tyranny of the majority. \n\nSo yeah, I do vote, whoopdeedoo, but your ideolgical mandate is stupid and honestly leads to tyranny. You don't know me or my land so keep your grubby ideological opinions out of it. ","created_utc":1521202337,"score":19,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I feel like most of these kids will get their protest notch in their belt, feel like they did something to help, and go on with their lives like the Women's March folk did. If you look at the make up of radicals vs women's marchers for example you might understand where I'm coming from. We're all radicals here, and for most the theory came before the action. We organize because our theory depends on it and we understand what happens to the world if we fail to organize anything substantial. If you look at the folks that attended the women's march (which I would posit are the same type of folk that are attending the walk outs), they're comfortable with the system, they just want to see certain things change, and they want their voice heard so they have a protest and that's the extent of their involvement. I'm not saying this as a mark against them, it's just a difference in ideologies. The kids attending this walkout see themselves facing a problem that they feel has been ignored, so they're doing what they can to be heard to see their problem fixed within the confines of the system, but I don't think there's any definitive proof that says they're going to commit themselves to this struggle. I'm sure the left could definitely do some outreach and a lot of them might be interested, but I just don't see this movement spawning into a radical movement of it's own means and accord like you laid out in your comment, and if it does, I *definitely* don't see gun control fading from the platform when that is what would start the hypothetical movement. \n\nThose are just my thoughts though.

You can fully embrace all the tenants of free-market capitalism and be totally on board with rejecting militarism and colonialism.\n\nOnce you get a handle on the sins of the American empire, it doesn't take too long to realize that all of the worst excesses of the War on Terror and the global network of bases are here too--mass surveillance, the carceral state, exploitative financial arrangements. After that, it just takes a little bit of reflection to realize capitalism at the root of this, and *that's* when it's time for Bookchin, Kropotkin, and the rest.\n\nAnyway, I'm glad you've had something of an awakening.

They divided Catholic Irish-Canadians, many of whom were torn between loyalty to their new home and sympathy for the aims of the Fenians. The Protestant Irish were generally loyal to Britain and fought with the Orange Order against the Fenians.

Even an anarcho-communist collective is basically a market, since individuals who can work agree to pay in a certain amount of labor in exchange for a certain share of the output.\n\nImagine a world where everyone is some kind of anarchist. Nobody in this world would be able to force one economic arrangement on anyone else, so people would have to negotiate with each other when they worked on projects making things or whatever. Many people would probably team up to make factories or farms or something, because it makes sense economically to produce a lot of one thing and sell it, and within the community they'd probably arrange some kind of fair distribution. But not everyone wants or needs all the same things, so if everyone in the town had an equal share of the town's total produced goods, it would be foolish to divide up the total number of each item produced and distribute them evenly to each person. Or maybe that would be good, but then we'd have to trade the stuff we got but don't want for the stuff someone else got but doesn't want. It would be handy to have some abstract representation of value so I could make sure I was still getting my fair share.\n\nOr imagine my town has a factory that makes screws. If we didn't trade, we'd have to give screws to every nearby town and factory and then hope that someone would give us an equal value in everything else that we need. But how much value are our screws worth? Do we actually produce enough screws to support the labor from the countryside that is required to feed us? What if another town makes a screw factory too, and now there's a screw surplus, but we keep delivering the screws to factories that don't need them and don't realize that what we're making no longer has any value to the nearby communities.\n\nIt would be easier in some respects if we brought the screws out to the nearby place and they gave us some symbol of abstract value, or something with a stable value like gold or bullets (probably not these but you know, something that's always good to trade) and then we divided that up among all the factory workers, and we were able to go out to the nearby towns and trade for what we actually wanted. Assuming everyone was generous and pitched in when somebody's product was worth less than expected, and refused to be manipulated by the extra wealthy, this would work pretty well.\n\nI know there's a risk of accumulation of capital, but at least there's no centralized state or council or ruling majority that can exert force on others. Also there'd be no pigs to stop us from robbing whoever got too rich.\n\nTL;DR free association among individuals necessitates negotiations and exchange of goods/labor, and that's trade so why not simplify it with currency?","created_utc":1521358803,"score":5,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Blechhotsauce","body":"I mean it seems sorta obvious that \"left unity\" has always meant one of two things: anarchists accidentally help authoritarians come to power and get murdered (Bolsheviks killing Free Territory, Spanish communists undermining CNT-FAI in Catalonia, for example), or it means tankies try to co-opt anarchist projects. So yeah, just about everything is better than \"left unity\" when, historically, left unity means \"authoritarians take over.\" On face, anarchism without adjectives is better.\n\nBut anarchism without adjectives is flawed because it ignores a significant source of conflict between anarchists, which is tactics, strategy, revolutionary organization (ie: how to conduct a revolution), and post-revolutionary organization (ie: how to organize society after revolution). I work with anarchists of all stripes doing labor organizing now because it's something we can all agree on--get more workers in radical unions, win short-term gains in the workplace to bolster living conditions for workers, build class consciousness for revolutionary action. Easy.\n\nWhere it falls apart is asking people to leave behind their adjectives when those adjectives are often at the center of how they view themselves *as anarchists*. So I'm an ancom/ansyn revolutionary. How should I cooperate with an anarcho-pacifist reformist? Other than agreeing on basic anarchist principles--and we both consider ourselves anarchists--how do we proceed? Some anpacs I've talked to on this sub have said that they would never participate in aggressive violence against the state or fascists. One anpac said that we should never harm Nazis, no matter what the Nazis say. So if we're fighting cops in the streets or defending our neighborhoods from Nazis, what are the anpacs doing? This is an extreme example, but it points out the fundamental point I'm trying to make:\n\nWe will never reach consensus of action when some of us have to leave behind our adjectives in order to cooperate with other anarchists. Starting from the supposition that we should just \"be anarchists\" ignores how we can work together *and separately* to dismantle the state and capitalism. Our deeply held beliefs about how to act, how to organize, how to conduct the revolution, are what defines us as anarchists. I'm not \"more\" anarchist than you, but I do believe that anarchism can only succeed if we adopt communism, and that's the system I will fight to create.","created_utc":1521361695,"score":14,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Hell, it doesn't even bring you into \"comfortable\" territory because that's reserved for a shrinking percentage of the population.\n\nStatistically, almost no one wins at capitalism. So to explain away systemic poverty as individualistic failures is a bunk argument ironically used to avoid feeling personal guilt for a system that grants them advantage over others.\n\nThere is no way that argument actually works. I've tried it. Liberals will reposition it as \"You don't understand economics if you treat it like a zero sum game.\" or launch into personal anecdotes about social mobility despite \"99% can't fit into 1%\" being an observation about statistics and not about economics.\n\nTheir identities are wrapped up in the status quo. At worst they think they've found enlightenment in the middle between \"Not exploiting people and putting an end to systemic violence\" and \"totalitarianism.\" At best they're naive and don't realize they're arguing in favor of systemic violence for their personal benefit. But in nearly all cases, they don't want to be wrong (as Peter Coffin describes it, people must be perpetually correct). So they dig down deeper into their position when it's assaulted.\n\nI'm trying to find a way to approach these things differently. Recently I've been trying the emotional angle that tries to make people feel vulnerable: \"Would you want your mother to live in abject poverty?\" Or statements that might make someone feel powerful: \"Wouldn't it be great if a boss didn't choose for you how you directed your labor?\"\n\nI've begun to think that I need to get people to look at something in a new way that benefits them rather than just presenting rigid logic at them.

Hence, we will only violate them one by one, and case by case.\n\nRule #2\n\nBe polite: don't speak to us any more of laws, of the Constitution, and of all these flights of fancy of a bygone age. For some time, as you will have noticed, we have passed laws that put us beyond the law, as well as whatever remains of that so-called Constitution\n\nRule #3\n\nYou are weak, isolated, dazed, abused. We are numerous, organized, strong, and informed. Some say that we are a mafia. This is false. We are THE mafia, the one that vanquished all the others. We alone can protect you from the chaos of the world. Which is why we so enjoy penetrating you with the feeling of your weakness, of your \"insecurity\". For it is to this degree that our racket remains profitable.\n\nRule #4\n\nThe game will be for you to flee, or at least attempt to flee. By fleeing, we mean: overcoming your state of dependency. The truth is, right now you depend on us in every aspect of your life. You eat what we produce, you breathe what we pollute, you are at our mercy over the slightest toothache, and above all you are powerless against the sovereignty of our police, to which we will have full discretion, indeed, in both action and assessment.\n\nRule #5\n\nYou will not be able to flee alone. Thus, you will have to begin by constituting the necessary solidarities. To make the game more difficult, we have managed to liquidate all forms of autonomous sociality. Only work has been allowed to remain: the sociality under control. For you it is therefore a matter of fleeing work - by theft, by friendship, sabotage, and self-organization. Oh, one more thing: every means of escape is now a crime.\n\nRule #6\n\nwe've never stopped repeating it: the criminals are our enemies. By that you must first understand the following: that our enemies are criminals. As potential deserters, each of you is therefore a potential criminal. Which is why it is good that wee keep a list of the numbers that you have called from your telephone, that your cell phone allows to locate you at every moment and your credit card to know all of your habits so well.\n\nRule #7\n\nIn our little game, those who leave their isolation are thus called \"criminals.\" As for those who would have the audacity to contest this status, we will call them \"terrorists.\" The latter can be killed at any moment.\n\nRule #8\n\nWe are well aware that life in the ranks of our society contains as about as little joy as a ride on the metro; that the wealth produced thus far by capitalis has only been a universal desolation; that our worm-eaten order no longer has any other argument than the flash-grenades that protect it. But what do you expect - that's the way it is! We have disarmed you mentally, physically; and now we hold the monopoly on all that we have denied you: violence, complicity, and invisibility. Frankly, if you were in our position, wouldn't you do the same?\n\nRule #9\n\nYou will know prison.\n\nRule #10\n\nThere are no more rules. All moves are permitted.\n\n-YOUR GOVERNMENT","created_utc":1521431870,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"FPNarrator","body":"I think there are two approaches to social problems that often get mixed up: how to make your own life less shitty and how to make society less shitty for everyone. Straightening those two things out helps to keep arguments on track. \n\nTake as an example the controversial comment that millennials can't afford homes because they're buying avocado toast. We can (possibly) agree that we can make our own lives less shitty by being frugal -- making rather than buying lunches at school or work. I personally have learned to love the cheap food, like bean burgers and spicy rice, that I make at home to help me cope with poverty. They're delicious, and I save more money. But our lunchtime spending habits are not the source of the housing problem. Income inequality, rent exploitation, or the lack of accessible housing is the source of the problem. Being more frugal with our money may help some of us overcome the symptoms of a problem, but it will not solve a problem that is clearly worsening. \n\nThe issue with the \"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\" and \"lean in\" mentality is not that it can't (sometimes) offer good advice to those of us trying to survive poverty. The issue with that mindset is that focusing on what the individual can do ignores the sources of poverty in the present context. \n\nSo when having arguments with conservatives, always spell out with them whether you're debating how to live better or how to make the world a better place. It's easier to overcome their points when you prevent them from using self-help as viable social/political criticism.\n\nFor example, we know that kids born to poverty are much more likely to be impoverished as adults. Poor nutrition at a young age and a lack of attentive parents both have negative longterm effects on children. We can talk all day about good advice for impoverished children to help them climb out of poverty themselves, but for fucks sake, they're just children. No child should be born to poverty. No child should have poor nutrition. ","created_utc":1521433889,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I had a deep conversation with a friend who was apologizing to me because, he didn't realize what was up until Breightbart had overt fascist articles.\n\nThe only problem the Antifascist now face from what I see is the unevenness of their fights. They need to not only fight the White Nationalist but, all ethno-nationalist, like, Louis Farrakan for example. Because, that unevenness is the only thing that's keeping the former white nationalist leaning people who see the errors of their ways from completely jumping on board.

They do this by telling them a combination of, \"you're awesome, the world let you down but, I'm here to help\" and, \"the others have somehow stolen from you\" (the others usually being another powerless group). Then, they take power and fuck over the guys they gave them the power, for example, the Sturmabteilung's fall during the Night of Long Knives. Further explanation, the Sturmabteilung was the Nazis paramilitary arm that consisted of unemployed and lower income true believers that were disbanded and executed during the purge after Hitler took power. \n\nI say all that to state two things, Racism is probably less prominent in this country than ever before (as much as it doesn't seem like it). The guys that I saw leaning into the White Nationalist ideas were Lower Income mostly White men that lost most of their economic power but, when the leaders like Richard Spencer became overt with their racism these guys dropped the Alt-right. \n\nSecond, remember, it all ties back into economics. The working class in America aren't nearly as bad as the Weinmar Republic post Treaty of Versailles.

{"author":"Cosmic_Traveler","body":"To prevent oversimplification and to delineate these two definitely distinct theories, Marxist 'Dutch-German' council communism implies more planning of resource distribution by and for the human species controlled via a sort of democratic *de*-centralism (contrasted from Leninism's democratic centralism) as well as a greater emphasis on workers'/our complete self-liberation from stratified, social classification completely (contrasted from vulgar workerism which syndicalism does not explicitly rule out) than anarcho-syndicalism. Following this, council communism is also obviously explicit in abolishing any formation of markets or market structures as a means of trade/exchange between councils/syndicates/institutions-of-production, which would reproduce capitalism. Furthermore, it calls for a real revolution (read: authoritarian by nature) lead by the vast class-conscious proletariat and any bourgeois class traitors that tag-along too, whereby they temporarily establish authority at the workplace core of labor-expenditure and value-production via councils, diverging from the vanguardist party theories but also anarcho-syndicalism as well.\n\nThe aims of an-syn seem to merely be the removal of the separated authoritative human beings (the bosses) from the capitalist class position, without a really clear path to that point, much less a real intent/attempt at abolishing capitalist ideology itself; to which I say it lacks a strict materialist analysis* as well as ironically lacking, simply put: **imagination** tbh. I have also garnered that to many, syndicalism is more of a vague general strategy/tactic of working class organization, although that doesn't exactly help its case. Either way, imo an-syns are almost 'there' (closer than most tankies for one, that's for sure). The theory just does not encompass enough of society and only explicitly attempts to mend the symptoms of a greater social illness. I will admit I am not an expert on all of the ins-and-outs of an-syn as a specific ideology nor its literature (I'm still learning about communism myself, so anyone please refute/reply to me if you think I am wrong about anything).\n\n*Sorry for being that Marxist and repeating this tired talking point, but it bears repeating. :/","created_utc":1521483465,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Super simply, hyper-nationalism plus (a varying degree of socialism/syndicalism, depending on the group, with major figures like Strasser or Goebbels being basically National Bolsheviks, while others, like Ludendorff, essentially ignoring all senses of the civilian economy in favor of the sole needs of the army-state). \n\nIn essence, Fascism doesn't espouse human inequality so much as it espouses a limitation on who gets to fully qualify as a human in the first place. It's appeal is actually highly dependent on internal *equality* for those who are members of the ingroup. In fact, Fascist parties derive their popularity primarily based on this promise of equality, in comparison to traditional right-authoritarian groups, with the core emotional appeal often being to populations emerging from wartime who remember the societal fusion/commonality that occurred during the early years of armed conflict. In this regard it is remarkably similar to traditional views (not the modern philosophy) of ubuntu, where humanity/personhood is gained through performance of traditional customs of behavior/traits. \n\nThe modern alt-right is an extension of these beliefs. The alt-right is a highly seductive ideology because it promises that same sense of community combined with superiority. If it is to be broken, you have to break the sense of community and expose it for the lie that it is. Only then can you start to defuse the sense of superiority.

{"author":"directoriesopen","body":"I can understand this sentiment (to an extent), but I disagree with it. And I think a lot of what drives this sort of sentiment is a misunderstanding of gun violence and people arming themselves. \n\n&gt; America is constantly ravaged with disgusting and horrifying gun crimes, massacres and attacks. \n\n\"Ravaged\" is a problematic word here. Massacres and attacks (like that of the recent school shooting, or the Las Vegas Shooting) do happen, but are a small minority of the deaths caused by guns in society. \n\nIn fact, of the ~33k people who die every year due to guns, 2/3rds (about) are suicides. Another 1/3rd is homicides (which is generally crime related, which is primarily caused by poverty). \n\nMore people are killed yearly through accidents than mass shootings or terrorism. (Stats from 538, the [article is really good for understanding gun violence in America](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/)). \n\nSo basically if we want to address gun violence and deaths in a meaningful way, we need to address mental health and poverty. \n\n&gt; military trade weaponry.\n\n\"Military trade\" means relatively little. A bolt action rifle is used militarily in many situations. A semi-auto .556 rifle is also used. Take [this](https://warrenvandervalk.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/rifles.png) image for example. The bottom rifle looks just like your normal hunting rifle (and basically is). The top looks like a scary military rifle, but they're basically the same thing (save some minor differences). The difference between normal guns and \"military guns\" is oftentimes just in semantic things like looks. \n\n&gt; How can an ideology that is for the betterment of mankind support the common usage and ownership of military trade weaponry?\n\n(I added a question mark cause I'm a stickler for grammar :P ) Simply put, the people being armed gives them power. An armed populace is more of a threat to entrenched entities (be it an authoritarian state or corporation or whatever) than an unarmed populace. And history is one of the better ways to see this. In America union workers won rights through armed protest (and oftentimes directly fighting with corporation soldiers or US soldiers). \n\nThe [Battle of Cripple Creek](https://aflcio.org/about/history/labor-history-events/battle-cripple-creek) and the [Battle of Blair Mountain](https://www.history.com/news/americas-largest-labor-uprising-the-battle-of-blair-mountain) are two more prominent examples of armed workers fighting for their rights. Another example is the Black Panther Party which was seen a major threat to the status quo in part because they were willing to arm themselves (and their use of open carry lead to Reagan outlawing [open carry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulford_Act) in California). \n\nSo more succinctly said, people being armed gives them power. \n\n\n\n&gt;  Someone said that \"liberals\" tend to get scared when people bring AR-15s to protests, for a good reason they don't want to die in a shoot out with either the police or right wing nutters and leftist protesters. \n\nSo this is something I can agree with. But I think we have to weigh the issues here. Liberals will be scared the second that a right wing group is there with guns. That's just reality. But they may actually feel some comfort when the left wing groups show up to protect them. \n\nThis actually happened during Charlottesville. Alt-righters/neo-nazis were threatening black pastors (and others) in a church (during their torch march). In response people from Antifa/Redneck Revolt went and basically escorted them out so they felt safe and couldn't be harassed/hurt by the alt-righters. One of the pastors said: \"...antifa saved my life twice on Saturday. Indeed, they saved many lives from psychological and physical violence...\" ( [article](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/08/what_the_alt_left_was_actually_doing_in_charlottesville.html)).\n\n&gt; don't keep military grade weaponry in your house. \n\nFor all the reasons above I disagree with this. At times bringing weapons to protest can alienate people (which I don't like) off the bat, so bringing weapons to protests isn't always good. But by all means, I think that people should be armed to defend themselves and their communities. \n\n----\n\n\nGuns generally aren't about winning others hearts or minds. They're about the ability to protect ourselves and not be powerless. ","created_utc":1521499181,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

They relay messages to their local Units, some of which are active above ground, but most of which rove the world through a network of secret tunnels, and in the backs of freight rail cars. These messages contain detailed instructions on what slogans to chant, how many extra masks to bring, the proper ratio of black flags, red flags, and black and red flags, and most importantly how many trashcans are to be tipped over.\n\nTo be admitted into Antifa, you have to go through a fairly sophisticated initiation process. That process begins by joining a Black Bloc protest, and speaking to whomever is hoisting the tallest flag.

Like stats show that pretty much any law that makes it harder to get a gun, reduces gun-related crime. Furthermore, the crime we have most evidence of gun control reducing is domestic violence. A woman in an abusive relationship is [5x more likely to get shot](https://www.thetrace.org/2016/08/15-facts-that-show-how-guns-make-domestic-violence-even-deadlier/) if their partner is a gun owner. The fact is that the majority of gun owners are male and the vast majority are white. And with the current structures in place, guns only help to empower the classes and groups of people who already have power.\n\nI'm all for ways of resisting the police state, but to act like there isn't a tradeoff is ridiculous. If anything, anarchists should be advocating for laws like the one recently passed (or being passed?) in Oregon which bans people who have a history of domestic violence from owning guns.

{"author":"idealatry","body":"*Blood and Belief: The PKK and the Kurdish Fight for Independence* by Aliza Marcus\n\nTurkey often justifies it\u2019s invasion into Rojava as a defensive measure against the PKK itself, while YPD denies any direct command, there are obvious associations. This book so far has been an illuminating look at the PKK\u2019s origins. I\u2019m about 1/3 through, and it puts a different perspective on the sort of things Abdullah \u00d6calan says in writings post-imprisonment and how he acted in beginning. He started out as a very Leninist figure (which isn\u2019t too surpassing given his Marxist-Leninist views), and even went so far as to encourage assassinations of PKK members who didn\u2019t agree with him (one of whom, Cetin Gungor, was a member who argued for a more democratic PKK and thought \u00d6calan was becoming too controlling). And I have a feeling I\u2019m just getting to the bad stuff.\n\nOf course, you also have to take into account the context in which the PKK was formed, where a brutal repression against Kurds had been ongoing for decades. Among several resistance and reformer groups, the book credits the PKK\u2019s willingness to take action immediately instead of just talk as why they initially won hearts and minds. But the sort of violent action and the organizational authority exhibited by the group demands scrutiny. ","created_utc":1521555848,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

If a couple grows irreconcilably apart, then we say they should just go their separate ways. If they are compatible there are many other reasons besides unqualified loyalty to stay together and fight for each other. The right imposes concepts like marriage to enforce blind loyalty, with separation being seen as dishonorable for violating that loyalty. \n\nTo the left, loyalty alone is a poor reason to do something.

{"author":"Kropatrick","body":"I'm not going to address the previous comment you've made equating antifa with fascism, but there's other shit to unpack here, namely how lacking in sociological nuance this argument is. I'm not trying to be a prick to you specifically, but your argument is in line with what we usually hear on the subject.\n\nOrganizational size is a decent attempt at getting some numbers (better than most do, so good job there), but we know that fascists are decentralized (and have a huge habit of breeding lone wolves), and, more importantly perhaps, that fascism and its consequences are not limited to capital-F Fascist organizations. We also know that radical movements often empower more moderate movements by making them seem more reasonable (this is known as \"radical flank theory\"), and fash are undoubedtley enabling a lot of mainline conservatives to get more unashamedly bigoted. This affects the lives of the marginalized in very direct ways.\n\nThe line \"you'll just breed more Nazis\" is one of those unfounded claims that sounds good but has no evidence to back it up. Not to be a fucking rationalist\u2122 but common sense arguments like this are always flawed and subject to dominant ideological forces; as anarchists we should be keenly aware of this.\n\nFinally, almost all internet discourse I see on the left concerns optics, and it's abysmal. The point of antifa is not strictly an issue of national/international scale, communities have the right to drive fascists out of their towns. We aren't a vanguard movement, and the consequence of that is that you don't get to decide how anarchists should react to their local circumstances. Obviously everyone should be open to criticism, but I think a little bit of faith in comrades is sometimes helpful. Trying to direct a stable anarchist platform on a national scale is both fruitless and foolish.\n\nThere are undoubtedly shitty antifa collectives, I've seen some be shitty firsthand (and this puts comrades in danger) and undoubtedly there's a lot of traveling antifa which complicates the \"local response\" line,  but treating antifa as some monolithic optics campaign is so intrinsically against how anarchist praxis should work. It also reeks of respectability politics, which is also intrinsically antithetical to anarchism.\n\nLike let's actually do some analysis on the tactical value of antifa, but let's use some fucking nuance in the process, okay? If you want to argue for the moral or philosophical need for pacifism fine, I have strong anpac sympathies myself (and, like you, love Crass), but you're not making a normative argument here, you're making a sociological one.","created_utc":1521588213,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

"body":"I've always found that they find it hard to rebut to providing a history of the idea of the tragedy of the commons, alongside a full explanation of what exactly has been proposed.  Most conservatives, neolibs, and libertarians have interpreted the tragedy of the commons to be \"if nobody owns a piece of land, then nobody takes care of it.\"  This was never suggested and is totally false.  The original idea was published as a thought-experiment by Garrett Hardin in *Science* (Vol. 162, issue 3659, pages 1243-1248), building on an obscure pamphlet by an amateur mathematician from 1833.  The idea was that multiple, entirely self-interested parties with open-access to a scarce, limited club good, without regulation, and without a means to communicate in any way, would over-use resources.  It also assumes that each individual involved is unaware of and unable to find the solution to the prisoner's dilemma.  This has never been tested in an experimental environment (as people always have ways to communicate and are not entirely self-interested), but the theory works within the confines of the thought experiment.\n\nIn the classic example, ten shepherds are trying to graze their sheep on the same field.  The field can only support a limited number of sheep (say, 2.000 sheep) before the sheep begin to overgraze and damage the land.  In this way, each shepherd can only graze a maximum of 200 sheep on the field (as an average), before he starts to screw other shepherds over.  The problem is: a greedy shepherd can gain an advantage over the other farmers by grazing additional sheep.  Let's say that he adds 20 sheep to his herd of 200, so that he's grazing 220 sheep and the field is supporting 2,020.  Now the quality of the fields start to diminish, as do the quality of the wool and mutton extracted from the sheep, and the only way that the other shepherds can recoup some of their losses is by each of them adding at least 20 sheep to their herd.\n\nIn real life, as any libertarian or neoliberal will tell you, people are capable of rationality, and can predict this outcome about as well as they can predict the prisoner's dilemma.  Also, in real life, people are capable of communication.  The shepherds would be able to come to an agreement and establish some regulations on the use of the field, and if one of them was a real asshole about it, to come to some resolution over the dispute.\n\nNow here's the kicker: Hardin's article was *a critique of unfettered free market capitalism*.  We can see the tragedy of the commons in action today when the use of a public or club good (such as the ocean, the beaches, or the atmosphere) is abused by greedy shepherds who all want to dump their waste or make use of more resources than their peers.  Overfishing, the coming sand-shortage, poaching, and climate change can all, in some sense, be attributable to this problem.  The rationality of economic agents is subsumed by the profit-motive, and the abilities of communication, coordination, and cooperation are hampered by states, borders, and \"free\"-trade agreements, then the tragedy sets in.  So the solution to the tragedy of the commons we experience today is either to abolish capitalism or to give one company a monopoly on the atmosphere.  Pick one.  (If anybody picks the second, don't be their friend).","created_utc":1521593402,"score":6,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Under capitalism the surplus value accrues to the employer not because he has a badge with \"boss\" on it, but because he owns the fixed capital needed in production. In effect, it's capital that accrues the surplus value, regardless of whether its a billionaire who owns the capital, or a group of workers at a coop.  \n\nYou have two options :\n\n1. For the worker at a coop to retain the surplus value WITHOUT providing capital you basically need to abolish the ability of capital to accrue surplus value, ie abolish capitalism. Otherwise you need a capitalist to provide the necessary capital and give the surplus value away to workers, and these unicorns are hard to find. \n\n2. If the worker has to provide capital as a coop entry condition, well then he will get the surplus value for owning capital, but then his pay can't be compared to that of a propertyless worker. \n\nCoops allow worker involvement in the running of the company, they don't magically abolish capital's exploitation of labour.  Given that's the case, it explains why coops aren't everywhere. \n\n","created_utc":1521597288,"score":4,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

"body":"Yes and no.\n\nNot to steal Rachel Maddow's shtick, but I think it's worth taking a step back before really going into this. The basic bargain that internet 2.0 (primarily based on mass social media vs. the older model of specialized message board sites) has run off of is a trade of consumer information in return for free services. As someone in his mid-20's who has grown with the internet, it's hard to underestimate just how much free content and services are available today compared to before. Youtube alone hosts a staggering ocean of free content that would in older times be incredibly expensive to own and consume. The trade off is, of course, personal information. Beyond Google and Facebook, Web 2.0 is barely economically viable, and, for the vast majority of sites, isn't. Even highly popular services lose massive quantities of money a year, being kept afloat by investors hoping that one day things will turn the corner on profitability. \n\nThis is where targeted ads come in. Revenue is at a premium online, meaning that every penny must be wrung out of consumers who like getting stuff for free. Mass advertising, like on TV or radio, is thus completely out of the question. Rather, the internet leverages the one major advantage it has, targeting through its ability to track the individual user and pinpoint the ads to their perceived desires. Without targeted advertising (and by necessary extension information collection) Web 2.0 doesn't exist and we pay monthly fees for facebook, twitter, snapchat, ect. Which would drastically reduce the amount of people using them, wrecking their core desirability in the first place.\n\nSo, to set the stage, the modern internet runs on the basic bargain that consumers accept a degree of information collection in order to ensure that the absolutely gigantic amount of free services and content they get remains viable.\n\nWe've always basically known that this data collection would also get applied to politics. The Obama Campaign, for example, pioneered early methods of identifying potential voters and targeting mobilization campaigns. However, the systems were never perfect, and, most importantly, they all ran on information that we had traded in the first place. In the case of Facebook, this is information that FB itself had obtained from us as the result of us using the service. Third parties could only obtain additional information through us voluntarily allowing them to (which is why there is a prompt for all those third party services on facebook).\n\nThis is where the current explosion in interest in Cambridge Analytica comes in. Cambridge, in my view, is a scandal right now because it broke two fundamental rules that kept the uneasy bargain behind Web 2.0 afloat. First, you generally only pay what you agree to pay information wise, and two, that targeting would be good, but not *too good*. \n\nThe data breach that occurred basically resulted in Cambridge Analytica getting information that we had not agreed to \"pay\". We had not consented to that third party obtaining that information in a prompt, or other factor. In addition, Facebook was apparently aware of this breach of a fundamental web 2.0 bargain and did nothing about it. \n\nSecondly, targeted advertising has always sort of tread the line of the uncanny valley, which has kept it tolerable. As a person of carriage, I try to keep up to date on the tools needed to fight my long campaign against my lipid cells (it's like trench warfare, but with somewhat less barbed wire). Whenever I do some particularly deep digging, the targeted algorithms suddenly start shifting, with the end result being that a years worth of advertising would suggest that I am an overweight, fashioned focus, latina (never understood this, beyond my love of *Ugly Becky*, with a strong interest in apolyptic christian theology, barbecue and AR-15's, while also being an older Russian man who is really enthused about space games. Meanwhile, I'm Balkan-Vietnamese, male, raised in Alabama, and just happen to have an interest in the mechanics of Soviet logistics, the mechanics of old firearms, Catholic theodicy (study of the problem of the existence of evil), and trying to lose the fat gained from eating barbecue. Basically the algorithm is good enough to generally show me things I might be interested in, but isn't good enough to really know me, which allows for better advertisement without freaking me out too much.\n\nPolitical targeting is no different, including the early Cambridge models that the Cruz campaign used. The Cruz campaign even came out with a stance on firework purchase and use, just because the data made it look like that might help shift some 5-600 Iowans. Silly, yes, but telling. The nice thing is that apparently the earlier models weren't that good, with 1/2 of the voters not really being as advertised.\n\nThe problem was that the models *got really good*. More importantly, Cambridge basically took the fight out of election season and into daily life. We've seen political advertising and mobilization out of cycle, but for the most part it dies down a bit. However, Cambridge mastered the art of siloing its targets, ensuring that every day they were carefully sequestered in an information cocoon that kept them from breaking out. This is, in my view, the underlying scandal that is fueling a lot of the outrage. You have to actively choose to watch Fox News, Cambridge, on the other hand, can organically sequester you while you are online.\n\nIn addition, we've learned a lot more recently about the origins of the Trump campaign, in particular the fact that Cambridge was testing what became the core lines of his campaign \"build the wall\" \"drain the swamp\" in 2014, and the fact that Bannon was basically a shadow president behind the while thing. \n\nBasically Cambridge has gone from \"really good political consultant\" to \"holy fuck this is an actual shadowy conspiracy\", and it has done so with Facebook's apparent knowledge and inaction, if not consent. \n\nBeyond all this, Cambridge also made Karl Rove look like a saint, engaging in repeated mass electoral manipulation, such as bribery and good ol fashioned honey traps. Their use of data targeting in less well developed nations is also especially repugnant because its basically bringing a railgun to a Napoleonic battlefield. American elections are an incredibly refined affair in a lot of ways, which is why even a \"landslide\" rarely tops a 6-8% margin of victory. Actors like Cambridge can be countered or negated in this environment, and voters are generally aware of the mechanisms going around behind the scenes, even if it still has an impact on them. By contrast, a Kenyan opposition party, for example, doesn't have a similar arsenal to fight back.","created_utc":1521611751,"score":13,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

The latter want to abolish the state completely overnight, not understanding the conditions under which the state can be abolished. (2) The former recognize that after the proletariat has won political power it must completely destroy the old state machine and replace it by a new one consisting of an organization of the armed workers, after the type of the Commune. The latter, while insisting on the destruction of the state machine, have a very vague idea of what the proletariat will put in its place and how it will use its revolutionary power. The anarchists even deny that the revolutionary proletariat should use the state power, they reject its revolutionary dictatorship.

"body":"You're being technical, so allow me to be even more technical!\n\nIn philosophy there are concepts of Determinism, free will, and Compatibilism. Determinism is the materialist outlook on human brains and our decision-making process. It says simply that our decision-making process is completely ruled by chemical reactions that happen in the physical world, with no interference from non-physical entities. Compatibilism is the conclusion that Determinism is true, but does not negate free will. People still think and decide which actions to perform, thus have free will.\n\nWhat happens when the philosophy of Compatibilism is applied to society as a while, instead of just individuals? Marxists are materialists, and thus compatibilists, and see society as a process of class relations. When class contradictions become too great to bear, a revolution occurs and ushers in a new society. Society is made up of independent individuals, however, and while they make decisions through a perspective of a particular class, they still retain their free will. Revolutionaries are not machines which carry out the revolution because a deterministic world compels them too, but people who must make and act upon a concrete decision that has a concrete effect on the world in which they live. Setting the goal of overthrowing current society to usher in a new one is not utopian, it is the realization of Marxist principles. Disagreeing about how such a revolution should occur, and what it's form should be, are also a realization of Marxist principles. ","created_utc":1521644444,"score":7,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

(For example -- I wouldn't call myself a Libertarian Socialist, but antifascist action still unites us as people on the left and gives us a shared goal). \n\nOne thing I like about Antifa is that it is a decentralized, grassroots organization. This gives it some huge advantages, but also some drawbacks. This is unlike Marxism (my area of study), where most resources on the internet are centralized/globalized to some degree. I figure with a website like this, there is an opportunity to unite the left on some shared goals and share resources/information -- not centralizing the group or movement itself, but centralizing some useful information for antifascist activists. Kind of like a wiki. \n\nThat's just my idea though, it's still a fresh idea. The niche is there for a website like this, but the idea still needs to be developed and I definitely can't do it all on my own. \n\nFeel free to ask more questions or PM me!","created_utc":1521660690,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

"body":"&gt; Socialism requires a social revolution in addition to an economic one\n\nSocialism *should also have this*, but it does not require it for it to be socialism. Socialism is an economic model, not a social one, just like capitalism is an economic model. They both more or less decide the social organization of society, but they are economic.\n\n&gt;Putting production in the hands of workers is great but if it is not coupled with a radical reorganization of society, it will not lead to an abolition of capitalism. There will still be wage labor, there will still be poor and rich classes, you will still need money to buy necessities, meaning the problems of homelessness, unequal distribution of healthcare and education etc, will all exist. \n\nI disagree with all of this. All of these issues are a result of the capitalist economic system, i.e a system in which the MoP are privately owned. A system in which the MoP are collectively \"owned\" (the term ownership doesn't really make sense here, 'managed' is better), money and wage labour will no longer be necessary. Economic classes will also cease to exist as we know them, as the rich no longer control the MoP and no longer have the system behind them that makes them rich.\n\nI agree that socialism needs much more than just democratic management of the means of production, but it *is* the foundation of everything else, and (afaik) the one thing all socialist tendencies have in common.","created_utc":1521660777,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Not as a means to engage in some performative/arbitrary/superficial/superfluous exercise, but really as a means of literal survival and I think to deny that right to defense--which yes, meaning right to violence--to oppressed peoples who need it more than anyone else is, for a lack of better words, an irresponsible idealist position at best or privileged at worst. \n\nSo i think with all of this in mind, the question of \"does anti-violence make me a liberal\" might quickly present too binary a conclusion for something so nuanced in ways described above.

Only the day before the army of the Turkish state and its jihadist proxies had begun the invasion of the autonomous region of Afrin, an area which had remained at peace throughout seven years of war and had become both a cradle for the Rojava revolution and a safe haven for hundred thousands of refugees from all over Syria. While the AKP and its allies ever more violently pushed Turkey towards fascism and the military brutally smashed the insurrection in North Kurdistan, Rojava and especially Afrin became a beacon of hope and resistance for all those who defied Erdogan\u2019s regime.\n\nComrade \u015eevger was from Turkey himself, he passionately wanted to join this resistance at the frontlines. He received basic military training in the canton of Ciz\u00eere and on 19th February arrived in Afrin, where he immediately took part in the ongoing defence. As part of the Anti-Fascist Forces in Afrin (AFFA), a unit of internationalist revolutionaries within the YPG, he faced the invaders in the vicinity of Raco in the northwest of Afrin.\n\nOn the 4th March comrade \u015eevger had taken position on a hill outside the village of Berb\u00eane ready to defend it against the advancing fascists. It was there that around 8AM he and two other YPG comrades were hit by an airstrike. All three of them lost their lives. In accordance with the wishes of his family his picture and legal identity will not be published, in order to protect the people close to him from repression.\n\nWe mourn the loss of our comrade and extend our condolences to all his friends, family and everyone who had the fortune to share their lives with this great and inspiring person.

The issue is this: the state will always use their greater firepower to gun us down whether we have guns or anything else, so what exactly is the point of asking them to please take away our guns too?\n\nEDIT: I quote from *The Coming Insurrection.*\n\n&gt;There is no such thing as a peaceful insurrection. Weapons are necessary: it\u2019s a question of doing everything possible to make using them unnecessary. An insurrection is more about taking up arms and maintaining an \u201carmed presence\u201d than it is about armed struggle. We need to distinguish clearly between being armed and the use of arms. Weapons are a constant in revolutionary situations, but their use is infrequent and rarely decisive at key turning points: August 10th 1792, March 18th 1871, October 1917. When power is in the gutter, it\u2019s enough to walk over it.\n\n&gt;Because of the distance that separates us from them, weapons have taken on a kind of double character of fascination and disgust that can be overcome only by handling them. An authentic pacifism cannot mean refusing weapons, but only refusing to use them. Pacifism without being able to fire a shot is nothing but the theoretical formulation of impotence. Such a priori pacifism is a kind of preventive disarmament, a pure police operation. In reality, the question of pacifism is serious only for those who have the ability to open fire. In this case, pacifism becomes a sign of power, since it\u2019s only in an extreme position of strength that we are freed from the need to fire.","created_utc":1521821400,"score":10,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

The problem with past experiences is that the left stopped with expropriation of the factories - the alienating features of capitalism were kept intact, only now the workers themselves managed this exploitation. As Seidman writes:\n\n&gt; The workers' refusal to participate enthusiastically in workers' control demonstrated that their class consciousness differed from that of their new industrial managers.

"body":"&gt;What would be wrong with being \"antihuman\"? \n\nI don't even know how to answer this question because it's silly. You can't escape your humanity.\n\n&gt;What if \"human needs\" don't line up perfectly with anarchist values?\n\nThey do though... We'd all be much better off if we lived in anarchist society. Physically, mentally, and socially. The underlying emotional and cognitive drives bias humanity towards communal life. Yes, evolution has also biased us toward aggression and dominance. But *those things hurt people and anarchist values help people.* \n\nAnyone interested in praxis should read Boehm. If you're reading him to tell you what to do, you're not going to find it. But, his extensive knowledge of the ethnographic literature suggests that, like many anarchist thinkers thought, egalitarianism is not the negation of hierarchy, but the active suppression of it. So, Kropotkin was right in \"Are We Good Enough?\" How is that not good news? \n\nPolitical philosophy is starting to be very subject to scientific falsifiability. Kahneman, Tversky, (prospect theory) and Ostrom (refuted tragedy of commons) have pretty much destroyed neoclassical conceptions of economics, and more people need to listen to them. But, their theories are based on a functional understanding of mind. \n\nI'm not ignoring the importance of postmodern thought. This sort of deconstruction and ultimate skepticism is a useful mental exercise. But I also want to get shit done, and I don't see why science can't learn something about the mind, or how human societies operate. Authoritarians and marketers are certainly using human nature against us. We better understand it. \n\nIt sucks that the left isn't keen on this stuff. I mean, it's pretty easy to get a little knowledge of behavioral economics. You learn how marketers are exploiting innate heuristical biases to gain advantage in the market. Stuff like that. It's fucked up. Basically a mild form mind control. You'll definitely understand your relationship with your employer better. And, there's pretty good evidence for microaggressions. When I was reading Boehm the other day, I gained insight into a way that I behaved badly, and texted my friend to apologize. Knowledge doesn't determine your character. It informs it. \n\nThe only thing the left would have to abandon is utopia, and as a post-leftist I don't assume you'd care. \n\n&gt;Shouldn't actual people, actual minds, matter more than \"humans\"?\n\n\"People\" and \"mind\" are as much a construct as \"human\". And yes, people matter more than our general idea of human nature. My point is that studying human nature can be instructive to ethics. And those \"minds\" you are worried about are products of an evolutionary history and can be studied to see how they function.\n\n&gt;Shouldn't some \"human needs and interests\" like say social status hierarchies, even relatively tame ones like among the most cooperative primates, take a back seat to what helps us flourish as minds rather than instinctive animals?\n\nYou're basing your understanding of human nature on nineteenth century conceptions of it. Modern conceptions actually understand the role that \"self-Transcendent values\" play in human social organization and individual wellbeing. \n\n\"Instinct\" is an old idea too.","created_utc":1521836701,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

So his disciples came to him and urged him, \"Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.\" He answered, \"I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.\" The woman came and knelt before him. \"Lord, help me!\" she said.

I was rude.\n\nThe truth is that I'm sad that this post in particular is upvoted because it really doesn't present much for discussion.

"body":"So this requires a bit of unpackig to explain. \n\nJesus, the historical rather than the theological Christian Jesus, was most likely a Jewish reformer and apocalyptic preacher. He preached the end of times etc. Etc. and focused his message on the Jews because, well, he was trying to \"fix\" the flaws that he saw in Judaism. Hence \"I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel,\" presumably because Judaism needed to be fixed and the religions of others wasn't a priority.  \n\nNext to that though, theologically speaking, egalitarianism and the destruction of nations and divisions runs strongly through Christianity. You can see this very early with the Pauline letters advocating for the Gentiles to be accepted alongside Hebrew converts.\n\nBut even later, when the 4 gospels were written down, Jesus is recorded as saying things that don't jive with a very exclusionary outlook. Look specifically at Matthew 8:11 (\"Many will come from the east and west and dine with your forefathers in the Kingdom of Heaven\") or the various versions of the Great Commision. Or you could look at Luke 4:24-27 where Jesus compares himself to Elijah and Elisha who went out of Israel and lived and administered to outsiders rather than the Israelites. \n\nSo we see that, even within Jesus' new Judaism, he's started to reject the idea that his message is restricted to the Hebrews. Instead he thinks that outsiders are welcome within that new version, and will be equal to the Israelites when the new paradise rolls around.

Radical feminists oppose anti-egalitarian human interactions (especially when they occur within the realm of intimate relations.) Therefore radical feminists oppose BDSM. It is really that simple.\"\n\nFeminist Current: [\"At what point should the kink community take responsibility for their \u2018anything goes\u2019 approach to sex?\"](http://www.feministcurrent.com/2017/10/10/point-kink-community-take-responsibility-anything-goes-approach-sex/)\n\n&gt;Sometimes those practices are harmful to others, sometimes they are harmful to the individuals themselves. Sometimes the practices are harmful to society as a whole. Pornography that depicts incest, racism, and abuse, I would argue, is not good for society, if indeed we wish to live in a society without those things. It is neither \u201cgood\u201d or \u201chealthy\u201d to draw no lines between what is ethical and what is not, simply because the thing is pleasurable. Building a society wherein living things are treated with respect will not come from encouraging people (men, in particular \u2014 as they are the people who are in a position of power already and socialized to view women as things that exist to provide them with pleasure) to indulge in any and every fantasy they have.\n\nFeminist Current: [\"The economics of consent: Why BDSM and consumer capitalism are closer than you think\"](http://www.feministcurrent.com/2014/09/29/the-economics-of-consent-why-bdsm-and-consumer-capitalism-are-closer-than-you-think/)\n\n&gt;We can see, then, that consent \u2014 even enthusiasm \u2014 of the exploited is not necessarily a useful paradigm for evaluating whether that exploitation is moral.\n\n&gt;This principle is simple, even intuitive, in these situations.\n\n&gt;So why does BDSM get a free pass?\n\nFeminist Current: [It\u2019s not about you: Beyond \u2018kink-shaming\u2019](http://www.feministcurrent.com/2012/07/10/its-not-about-you-beyond-kink-shaming/)\n\n&gt;Whether or not an individual enjoys being beaten up does not negate the possibility that eroticizing male dominance is tied to the fact that we live in a male dominated culture. Whether or not an individual consented to being dominated doesn\u2019t alter the context of patriarchy. Just because a person is not an evil piece of shit or a murderer in their day to day lives does not mean that their fantasies are not fantasies that were shaped by sexism and a porny culture that objectifies women and thinks that rape scenes should be masturbatory tools.\n\nBlog / Opinion: [\"Critique of BDSM\"](http://antibdsm.blogspot.com/2011/07/critique-of-bdsm.html)\n\n&gt;BDSM and Sexism: Men dominating and controlling women is considered erotic. Men physically abusing women is considered erotic. Men raping women is considered erotic. Sometimes it is women dominating and abusing men, or men dominating and abusing other men, or women dominating and abusing other women. But even in these cases it is often still male dominance and abuse against females that is eroticized. The female dom/sadist degrades her male sub with gendered language, calling him a pussy, slut, bitch, little girl. And it tends to be the macho male as the dom/sadist and the sissy \u2018fag\u2019 as the sub, or the butch dyke as the dom/sadist and the femme as the sub. Furthermore, it is a fact that amongst males and females into BDSM, females are much more likely than males to be subs, and males are much more likely than females to be doms/sadists. \n\nBlog / Opinion: [Why I'm Against BDSM - Radical Feminist Perspective](http://liberalfeministtropes.blogspot.com/2014/03/why-im-against-bdsm-radical-feminist.html)\n\n&gt;BDSM is contrary to the ideal of equality between humans\n\n&gt;This argument really needs no explanation. BDSM is an anti-egalitarian human interaction (it involves some people being dominant and other people being submissive.) Radical feminists oppose anti-egalitarian human interactions (especially when they occur within the realm of intimate relations.) Therefore radical feminists oppose BDSM. It is really that simple.\n\n&gt;Equality (i.e. the elimination of power hierarchies within sexual relationships and in general) is the aim. Without equality there can be no genuine freedom. It is freedom feminists fight for, not \u201cchoice\u201d. Not all choices lead to liberation and the fact that we may be allowed to choose our cell, does not mean we are not in a prison. Many of the choices women are faced with can be summed up as \u201csubmit to men this way or submit to men that way.\u201d Some lucky women have the option of being dominant rather than be dominated, but what about the option of having a relationship that involves two people treating one another like equal human beings?

Also for many people that it's purely a bedroom thing.\n\nA lot of the links you provided have flawed arguments though. A lot of them are super hetero and cisnormative.\n\nThere are problems within bdsm culture, but there are problems within all culture.

They just need to be fair.\n\nA lot of people say that both people on a date should contribute the same to the bill to be equal, I've always thought that using that as a general rule is wrong though because some people are able to afford much more than others.

Before modern insurance, and the welfare state, friendly societies provided financial and social services to individuals, often according to their religious, political, or trade affiliations.

"body":"I'm going to reuse an old comment to answer your question about what's so bad about ancapism. \n\nHere's what's so awful about ancapism: private property. \n\nPrivate property is what is wrong with anarcho-capitalism. Markets are fine. Voluntary social relations are great. Decentralization and statelessness are of course what anarchists want and are necessary components of a liberated society.\n\nBut private property is the basis of capitalism. And private property was created (and is still being created at this very moment, especially in so called \"developing nations\") by force and violence. Armed people used violence to destroy communal property and to then take it, claim it and hence create private property. And then, after they did this, they enforced these claims with violence and the threat of violence.\n\nAnd the problem with this isn't even that it is immoral, it is that ancaps use private property as a moral foundation for their society. They claim the moral right to defend private property claims with violence. So, when anarchists and individual seek to ignore private property rights because such rights are getting in the way of their liberation and individual empowerment, they have to deal with systems of violence that the owners and ruling class think they have the moral right to use against them.\n\nBut what happened to voluntary social relations? If individuals don't want to let the resources that the community all depends on be owned and controlled by a single person, why should they have to? Ah, well, the ancaps tell us, the sacredness of private property trumps the wishes of individuals. It is a moral principle. But that moral principle is just the product of ancient (and sometimes not so ancient) violence and conquest. Why should I allow myself to be ruled by that accident of history? And why do they worship it as a universal moral principle?\n\nAnd the ancap moral faith in private property's sacredness would cause them to create a state. They already advocate for the use of violence to enforce property rights. They advocate for private police, private jails, private courts. But how long before these end up in the pocket of unregulated businesses and the wealthy class, serving not some sort of abstract notion of justice, but serving the propertied interests. But, as soon as that occurs, you have a state my friend. You've reset the clock on classical liberalism, but you're still in the cycle of war, states, politics and rule by bureaucratic stupidity.\n\nThis is why anarchists see ancaps as neither anarchistic nor as ideologically coherent.\n\n","created_utc":1521933243,"score":24,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

"body":"Several sociological theory of racism kind of suggest power is inherent to racism, but one of the issues is the definition of power. Foucault draws some interesting, and worth while reading, images of power that suggest it can be taken almost at will. This is both empowering and destructive as a concept, after all will is driven by positive and negative traits, power is a potential, it's a wave that might gain strength.\n\nRacism likely does, I think, gain from power but not I think only in the singular sense you mention. Power is grasped by even the most vulnerable in society, the downing person clutching at anything to... feel better about themselves, or to justify the shit in their life is someone else's fault, to just fucking prove that they are really actually better than that one over there or to say fuck you...\n\n...racism is fear, ignorance, justification of action, a scapegoat, a method of control, self justification, reactionary, self fulfilling prophecy, superiority, it's also power.\n\nClass and class domination uses all of the above as tools to degrade, denigrate and maintain. All of the above are tools of the ruling classes to crush opposition and unity. They are also used to placate and nurture us all to ensure we stay where we need to be and they retain the power. We are fed with just enough delusions of superiority, crumbs of wealth and glittering trappings that we remain socially drugged and inert.\n\nClass dominators don't care what colour you are, they don't care if you're racist. You just have to comply. You just have to work and die quietly. You just have to be a cog or the grease in the mechanism. \n\nRacism is a tool of class control through division and mistrust. \n\n","created_utc":1521936000,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Markets were apparently a direct extension of kings and warlords trying to finance their armies or marauding bandits and keep their conquests a'pillagin' \u2013 drunk, amused, satiated, bellies full of stew and wine and all that. You can't really do that too well without on-the-spot exchange and coinage, as you might find people are reluctant to extend neighborly debt \u2013 formal or informal \u2013 to a band of thugs, armed to what teeth they have left,  who are just \"passing through.\" So, you stamp your face on some shiny metal, give it to the champs, then demand it back from the populace \u2013 or else. Eventually, currency starts circulating and more everyday social debts are paid in little shiny tyrants. And that's pretty much the birth of markets, long before you had precapitalists like Adam Smith writing about their liberatory potential. \n\nCapitalism is a narrower thing that came around much later \u2013\n started with mercantilists and late feudal labor arrangements, grew up with the industrial revolution. Instead of producing mostly for their own consumption, workers produce exclusively for exchange. When the 'means of production' (or 'capital') became concentrated in the hands of one group of people, with another doing the producing under a generalized system of 'wage labor' that eventually came to be known as capitalism. The word comes from the early critics that characterized it and tried to figure it out as its own distinct thing, like Proudhon and Marx. They used words like \"capitalist\" or \"capitalist system\" and such. Guess it stuck.\n\nIf you can imagine some society of self-employed artisans and craftsmen, whatever it might be like, that's not really capitalism. Anarchists would call that personal ownership or usufruct. If the workers own and run their mills, that's not capitalism either.

"body":"\"Classism\" is not a thing. Class distinctions are, but not \"classism\". I don't even know what \"classism\" is supposed to mean. An ideology surrounding and obscuring class relations? The way rich people treat poor people? Whatever it means, the term itself obscures a materialist analysis of capitalist social relations, and recalls the definition of racism as simple subjective prejudice. This is the way liberals seem to use the word, and I have no idea why anarchists use it.\n\nRacist thinking precedes capitalism, but it provides strong support for capitalist social relations and can only be understood through a materialist class analysis. \"Whiteness\" as we understand it today is the product of bourgeois society, and it's a key tool in social control. Workers who see themselves as \"white\" first and foremost are compromised. They see less in common with their black coworkers than they do with their white boss. This stifles solidarity. It also means, in the areas most effected by white supremacy, white workers make less money than where white supremacy is not so overt. Where white workers can be tricked into thinking they have a common interest with their boss against black workers, they can be paid in the \"psychological wages\" of whiteness, and underpaid otherwise. Since solidarity is stifled, class struggle stalls, and workers fight among themselves rather than for better conditions.","created_utc":1521947865,"score":7,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

A lot of the fundamental \u201cassumptions\u201d about human nature that could make an anarchist society possible actually relate to it. The thing is that modern anthropological studies have shown a lot of support for the anarcho-primitivist ideology. Don\u2019t forget that we spent most of our existence in tribes without the idea of private property. In fact when white people came to the Americas, many natives got killed for \u201cstealing.\u201d But to them, they had no concept of property so when they saw a cool object they\u2019d pick it up. There was no intention to \u201ckeep\u201d an object because they didn\u2019t have that concept ingrained into them like our society does.\n\nFurthermore, studies have shown that members of traditional hunter-gatherer societies actually enjoyed more free-time, lived healthier lives, and were usually happier than modern Westerners. There are also many well-supported theories that sexism and racism only popped up as a necessity to prop up the ideology of property. Marriage, and possibly monogamy, only began happening as a way to create a legal contract for a female slave. Since most food came from gathering rather than hunting, women often also provided more food for the tribe and were more respected. Similarly, modern racism popped up as an excuse to exploit the labor of others. \n\nMany of the ideals of anarchism seem like pipe dreams, but the reality is that many times it\u2019s simply a matter of going back to how we lived for millions of years before this.","created_utc":1521966314,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Armed anti-capitalist, anti-state resistance is not the reality of the US right now, and tbh seems unlikely anytime soon. \n\nBut back to the quote, guns are symbolic in a pretty major way. Force and violence is the name of the game when it comes to states. States keep their power by maintaining a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence through police and military. As anarchists its only logically consistent that we oppose the states monopoly on the use of violence and so oppose gun control. \n\n&gt;Does that mean that until then we need to have bi-weekly school shootings?\n\nThis is where I think mainstream coverage of mass shootings and gun control misses the mark entirely. Were I conspiracy minded, I'd swear it was an intentional misdirection to shift the story from away from a clear anti-capitalist tone and solution to one that de-escalates by moving the blame from capitalism to individuals and guns while simultaneously increasing state power at the expense of the people. But I'm not, imo gun control is just the simplest, easiest emotionally digestible story and the most naively simplistic answer to a complicated problem. \n\nSchool shootings are definitely in part about guns. But imo it's not guns that are the problem. Its the fetishization of gun violence in America culture, there are plenty of ways to kill lots of people that aren't guns. Cars for one. But we don't see high schoolers driving their cars into crowds of their classmates (thank god). Gun violence is fetishisized and glorified in the media, it is the 'normal' outlet for a alienated, disaffected white teenage male to express his anger at a society that tells him he must live up to an impossible standard, without teaching him the 'unmanly' emotional tools to deal with his feelings. \n\nSchool shootings are about shifting cultural values. Society still sends a message to young white men that they should be at the top of the totem pole. They're angry as they realize they likely will never be able to live up to that standard. Between increasing awareness of social justice and feminism, increasing wealth inequality, and the neoliberal trend of quantifying and atomizing individuals from one another and any resemblance of a community, we're raising a generation of young white men who are confused, angry, isolated, and unable to fulfill a role they believe to be their right who see gun violence as their only outlet. \n\nWill banning guns help fix this? Maybe a little, but that's not what it's really about. Gun violence is a symptom of years of neoliberalism, capitalism, racism, and toxic masculinity running amok in our society. It about the spectacle of the media and destruction of community structures and support systems. It's a public health issue. \n\nGuns are just a small part of it.

If more leftists owned guns instead of them being primarily concentrated in the hands of reactionaries, then they *would* be used in ways that would better society and stave off state oppression. The problem is that right now we don't have the necessary numbers of armed leftists, but the sollution to that isn't to give up and say \"armed resistance as a tactic is dead for the left, so disarm now\", it's to encourage a leftist gun culture so that the left has armed protest and resistance restored as a tool in the toolbox and can use it effectively the way the Black Panthers did and the IWW did in the 1890s-1920s. \n\nI'll never understand this \"well, no hope for empowerment now, might as well give up for good\" mindset. To do that would ensure that forever more we have only non-violent means to resist by in any significant numbers (because yes, guns can be stolen or made in garages, but it's easier to raise a militia of the people if the workers already are armed), which means that should the working class regain class consciousness and shake off the haze of leftover McCarthyism/the new rightist populism, you're looking at people having to willingly give their bodies as cannon fodder without having the means of power to make more of an impact with a better chance of survival. There is a reason so many leftist thinkers have been vocally in favor of a heavily armed working class. \n\nThis of course doesn't even factor in the truth that gun control is the least effective way to reduce violence and suicide: leftist economics and the reduced poverty and greater access to education/medical care/social support networks are the ways to meaningfully reduce violence by addressing the root cause. Gun control shifts the method of killing, but it's merely coincidence that many countries with heavy gun control have low violence rates, since the ones people like to point at the most also have reduced poverty and better social safety nets. You can also find countries with strict gun control and very high violence rates, and countries with relatively lax gun control and low violence rates, the correlation simply isn't that strong unless you cherry pick, but the correlation between poverty/capitalism and violence is undeniable and applies at all scales, whether city, state, nation, or region. So to give into demands for gun control is to slap a bandaid on the symptom that won't change things meaningfully in the US because guns aren't the cause of violence, our broken capitalistic society is.

"body":"Mass shooters killed fewer people across the last few decades than police did in the past *year*, in the US. The reason that this type of violence seems like a big problem is because the media pushes that agenda both because tragedy is profitable to report on, and because the capitalists who own the media outlets know they benefit from a disarmed working class. Rifles of all types (not just AR-15s, but also grampa's hunting rifle) are used in roughly 300 murders per year, fewer murders than ones where people are beaten to death with hands and feet, and means that they happen to literally less than 1 in 1 million people in the US any given year. Mass shootings are a very flashy (precisely by design, because they are acts of terrorism) drop in the bucket, and the truth of the matter is that the reason they inspire such massive pushes for gun control is that they tend to happen more often in white and monied communities, while the everyday violence that is inflicted on predominately POC communities and poor communities is seen as some sort of background noise. If gun control were leveled at the weapons used in the most murders, it would go after pistols, which are used in thousands per year. That said, it wouldn't be effective, since it doesn't address the root cause of the violence and would shift the means of killing but not the impetus: poverty and antagonistic mentalities created by capitalism, which have a much stronger correlation with violence rates worldwide than gun control. Gun control prevents *gun deaths*, but has no meaningful effect (on its own) on violence.","created_utc":1522004998,"score":16,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

That's a less than 1 in 1 million chance of being a victim averaged across the whole population. Police conversely kill over 1000 people each year, which, btw, is greater than the number of people killed in mass shootings in the US over the past few *decades*, and this of course doesn't even mention the fact that the flu kills more than this in a week during flu season, hunger/lack of shelter, heart disease, etc, take your pick, are all killing more people. It is advantageous to the state that there is outrage about mass shootings because it is advantageous to them for the working class to be disarmed, but in the grand scale of things they are flashy and horrifying but very rare tragedies, and it is unwise for us to call for our own disenfranchisement as a response to intentionally inflated grief. \n\nThis of course doesn't even address the fact that gun control is not the most effective way to reduce murder rates. You mention Japan, China, and Australia, and it is true that they have much lower rates of violence (not just gun violence, but violence in general), but consider also that they have much better social safety nets and lower poverty/inequality than the US (and that China is a very authoritarian society, which does in fact tend to reduce violence rates, but at great cost to human rights and individual liberty), and it is this lower poverty and better social safety nets that have the strongest correlation with violence reduction worldwide. You can see it even domestically within the US, as most of the violence occurs in impoverished urban centers (notably, many of which have very strict gun control like Chicago) and have murder rates similar to third world countries, while well-off suburban areas typically have murder rates like that of wealthy Northern European countries, even though suburban areas on average have looser gun control than urban centers. Likewise, at national levels, a country can have very strict gun control and still have much worse violence than the US, and typically will if the standard of living is lower on average, while some countries with relatively lax gun control by international standards (like New Zealand/Canada) have low violence rates, but also notably have much less in way of poverty. \n\nPoverty drives violence, and capitalism drives poverty.

"body":"How does one practically achieve this? To disarm those who don't wish to be disarmed (be they the people or the government) you will need some form of leverage, namely, an armed party disarming the others. Do you think everyone will just willingly disarm? And even if you do have one armed party disarming all the others, and somehow managing to find every last gun that isn't registered (hint: most of the guns in the US, and many of them in other countries) how do you then ensure that this disarming party will themselves give up the guns they were just using? Further, how do you ensure that nobody then makes their own guns from scratch? The average welder/machinist can make a gun quite readily if they want to, I personally know multiple people who have built guns either mostly or entirely from scratch (which is legal in most places in the US, btw) and these were highly functional. The same goes for ammunition, though a little harder, but still quite manageable to make at home (again, I know people who do this and have done this myself), especially if we get into black powder cartridges and/or cartridgeless guns like percussion and flintlocks. Do you think we'd be able to successfully silence/eliminate the thousands if not tens or even hundreds of thousands of people who are capable of building new weapons, even if we could magically make all currently extant guns cease to exist? How do you ensure that swords/spears (which are even easier to make) don't become the new instruments of state tyranny? \n\nGuns are out of the bag. They are not going away, unless you (impossibly) make all the extant ones cease to exist, and kill or successfully silence everyone who knows how to/has the means to make them. This is already a thing in Brazil where gun control is very strict, as there are workshops pumping out homebuilt SMGs of decent quality and they are constantly being discovered in criminal possession there. \n\nThis of course ignores the basic fact that if you could eliminate *all* weapons including not only guns but also swords/spears/clubs/knives etc, that the power of violence now rests in the hands of those who are physically strongest, meaning that the physically able will rule the physically less able. It also means that individuals would be more vulnerable to attack by groups, so hate crimes would no longer have a potential solution for the attacked minority in carrying a weapon. I'm a transgender and queer person, and I carry a gun in large part because some people like to get together and beat up or kill people like me just for existing. I'm a strong person and pretty scrappy, but I doubt I'd be able to hold my own against more than *maybe* two opponents of average size, unless I have some sort of advantage over them, which having a gun presents. As I age, and as hormone replacement therapy decreases my muscle mass, I will only become an easier and easier target. Having a gun will allow me a decent shot to save myself well into old age, should I ever be in such a situation. And don't say that the police will save me and people like me: firstly, they tend not to care as much about protecting minorities, and secondly, they can't be everywhere at once, nor do they have a legal obligation to save anyone from harm. I don't want to have my only recourse if I'm getting hatecrimed be to call out for help and fall victim to the bystander effect, or attempt to call the police and hope I survive the long minutes it will take for them to come and rescue me.

You haven't given me any reason to believe that the American military has made such advances that they're more prepared to take on a guerrilla insurgency than they were a decade ago.\n\n&gt; The Mujahideen were violent maniacs and supported by Washington.\n\nYou're not wrong, but the fact remains that when Washington turned against them, they still managed put the US through a costly war, ensuring America would see a Pyrrhic victory at best. My point isn't that the Mujahideen were an effective Anarchist movement, but rather that in the moment, guerrilla warfare can prevent you from being conquered. \n\n&gt; The NLF was destroyed by the USA demolishing the country side, impounding the population in concentration camps, carrying out widespread terror with the Phoenix Program, etc. Leaving the place open then for the Communists in the North to take over.\n\nI'll actually concede to you that Vietnam was a shitshow. In the long run, they succumbed to market reforms that removed any pretense of any independence from America. Nevertheless, I feel that my point stands that in case of an invasion or an uprising, guerrilla warfare works. There's no guarantee that it'll be without casualties and ultimately you'll need new tactics for independence once you're in power, but in the short term it may be all you have.\n\n&gt; These are you examples? That's pathetic mate.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a sad delusion of a revenge power fantasy.\n\nWith all due respect, I feel that a confrontational attitude is counter-productive. Nobody gets anywhere by fighting when not necessary. \n\n&gt; You get guns, they get swat and special forces and armored vehicles and helicopters and drones and School of the Big Shitholes counter insurgency warfare and a lot of innocent people hurt and dead which you dont have a right to make that decision for and cause those consequences for.\n\nNo empire is invincible, but no empire will willingly die out without some kind of confrontation. If there's a peaceful resolution that ends in liberation, then that's great and obviously the way to go. Sadly, I don't believe that most of those in power would go peacefully. But if warfare were to break out, they couldn't and wouldn't annihilate everyone, so a large enough opposition could still win.\n\n&gt; And its an absurd argument to even have I am so sick of explaining this childlike naivete. The USA is not on the verge of colapse. the NWO is not out to get you. The USA is a liberal democracy - one under the sway of extreme corporate interests that want everyone fixed on the government and promote this shit through the media they control so people are not looking at them - that can be swayed and compelled and changed for the better through organising and electing and pressuring.\n\nYou assume that the state has ever advocated for the interests of the people but this simply isn't true. While I agree with you that the corporations are an important obstacle to creating a better world, it's clear that the state isn't going to listen to people or else they wouldn't have carried out COINTELPRO or MK Ultra. The majority of conspiracy theories may be tinfoil tier nonsense, but this doesn't mean that liberal democracies have your best interests at heart. Frankly, it's naive to think that when history has shown time and again that the state has sided with the elites in cases ranging from the US police attacking strikers to the supposedly socialist USSR serving the whims of one tyrant. The state is a threat and if you don't believe this, I'm not entirely sure where you fit into Anarchism unless there's something I don't quite understand.\n\nWhat we need to do imo is attempt to organize an alternative economic and political system that competes directly with the current one.

"body":"I have worked with clients with mental illness and developmental disabilities for 7 years now, and in that time I would say about 1/3 of my clients that were involuntarily committed should not have been. I would also dare to assert that the vast majority of children that were involuntarily committed had no business being committed in the first place, I hate this industry. \n\nOne common reason for committing people that doesn't make any sense is self harm without suicidal ideation. I can't tell you how many self harming teen girls I have met in my line of work that are otherwise just like everybody else, similarly I can't tell you how many teen boys I've come across that were diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder that had just come from impoverished and difficult backgrounds and were responding appropriately imo. So many of the children I saw that had been committed seems like they were coming from environments where their parents had simply lost their patience and sometimes it even seemed like an elaborate way to punish them, which is incredibly silly given the immense expense to the parents.\n\nAllowing the profession of Psychiatry to determine who can and cannot own a weapon is not ideal considering the profit motive Psychiatry (and Loosely Affiliated Industries) has to assign a diagnosis. You would be shocked to see the way diagnoses are handed out in some places, I used to work at a place that used the same psychiatrist for all of their clients, we are talking a bit over 100 clients with one psychiatrist. Almost all of the girls were diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and almost all of the boys were diagnosed with ADHD. None of the girls had borderline personality disorder and only a few of the boys had ADHD, but all of them were regularly billed for both their medication and their time with the psychiatrist. All of them were overmedicated.\n\nWorking with adults with developmental disorders has also shown me that being committed involuntarily means very little. If your intellect doesn't happen to pass muster in the view of your parents they can and often do commit people for a 72-hour observation. That alone would disqualify you for owning a gun under current law. I also can't tell you how many high functioning sexual offenders I have met that will forever be in the system being cared for as if they have severe developmental disabilities but do not, the vast majority of them having been committed at some point. And just to clarify, we're talking about people with offenses as minor as walking into the wrong restroom on accident but living in a very conservative city,  of course some of them are actually perpetrators of horrible sexual abuse but the whole point that I'm making is both the actual predators and those that are not actually predators can both have histories of being committed.\n\nAnd to address the most common mental disorder, depression, I can actually speak from familial experience. When one of my family members' spouses passed away they entered a very severe depression which resulted in other family members committing them to an in-patient psychiatric facility. Of course, over time they got over the worst symptoms of their depression and returned to normal life. This person would not be eligible to buy a gun under current law without lying even though this incident happened 30 years ago and they can be truthfully described as being neurotypical.\n\nIf there was actually a uniform implementation of what the APA suggests then you might be able to approach a policy that makes sense (to liberals) regarding gun ownership, but the reality is I've seen practitioners that are really bad at their jobs and others that allow personal bias to influence their judgments in Incredibly egregious ways, and honestly whether or not you have ever been committed is a terrible litmus for whether or not you should be allowed a gun.\n\nAll that said, I do not support any form of regulation imposed by the state.\n\nI know that was ranting, but I had a lot of free time and this is a pretty personal issue as I am both a gun owner and also happen to work closely with a population that is regularly involuntarily committed. And if you happen to also work in this field know that I am fully aware that this is not the standard in the industry, I just happen to have worked in two states with exceptionally poor standards for Healthcare professionals and institutions, and that inequality of how and why people are committed is Central to the argument of why it doesn't make sense to use it to determine who should own guns, even from a liberal perspective.\n\nAnd I'm sorry for all of the capital letters but I'm way too lazy to go back and correct the voice to text.\n","created_utc":1522150733,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

This was particularly necessary for the Commune; and one of the reasons for its defeat was that it did not do this with sufficient determination. **The organ of suppression, however, is here the majority of the population, and not a minority, as was always the case under slavery, serfdom, and wage slavery**. And since the majority of people itself suppresses its oppressors, a 'special force\" for suppression is no longer necessary! In this sense, the state begins to wither away. **Instead of the special institutions of a privileged minority (privileged officialdom, the chiefs of the standing army), the majority itself can directly fulfil all these functions, and the more the functions of state power are performed by the people as a whole, the less need there is for the existence of this power**.\n\n\n\u2014V.I.

"body":"The ownership of capital itself induces a power hierarchy, where ownership of the means of production gives the owners power and incentive to extort and exploit other people, whether this be done directly or through the price mechanism. Even if the means of production are controlled collectively and democratically by the workers, this still creates power imbalances between workers and non-workers, and between various co-ops and syndicates with competing capitalist interests. As long as society is based on capital accumulation and commodity production for exchange it doesn't matter how democratic any individual industry or shop floor is - the nature of the capitalist system must inherently produce winners and losers, and thus breeds inequality and hierarchy.\n\nIt's worth remembering that despite their earlier rhetoric about democracy and solidarity, Italian syndicates and unions were among the earliest supporters of Mussolini, and many of his black shirts were union workers. The shop floor workers controlling the means of production *within* a capitalist system only made them more directly beholden to the needs of capital, and their democratic rhetoric fell by the wayside in lieu of naked self interest. \n\nTo eliminate the conflicts of interest inherent to capitalism requires dismantling capitalism. As long as our economic system allows for capital accumulation there will always be disparities in wealth and power which continually generate new hierarchies.

The revolution was farmers with long guns. \n\nYou literally can not know that our government will never try to throw some of its population into death camps. It's happened to quite a few (so many millions)  people in the past century. I bet they also thought \"guns are scarier than our government, they will never hurt us.\" Genocide is literally the very pinnacle of out to get you. Maybe all the Republicans/democrats/libertarians/[other political party] will be rounded up. Maybe all muslims/mexicans/natives. WHOEVER. The armed population of America will not stand idly by and watch as the government eliminates a group of people. But only as long as we can defend ourselves.\n\nIf you need be reminded which governments implemented gun control and later massacred large groups of people:\n\n1911: Turkey collected guns and then murdered a million christian Americans. \n\n1929: Soviet Union collected guns and then exterminated 20 million people.\n\n1935: China established gun control and then exterminated 20 million dissidents. \n\n1938: Germany stripped jews of their guns (rest of the country already had tight gun control) and then later massacred 13 million jews.\n\n1956: Cambodia enacts gun control and then disposed of a million educated people. \n\n1964: Guatemala established gun control and then exterminated close to 100,000 Mayans. \n\n1970: Uganda established gun control and later murdered hundreds of thousands of Christians.\n\nIn early America, gun control was used to prevent guns from getting into the hands of slaves and them starting an armed rebellion. Free blacks were denied guns in fear that they would end up in the hands of slaves. (http://www.theacru.org/the-truth-about-gun-control-racism-and-genocide/) \n\nGuns are power. Power in the hands of the proletariat is ALWAYS better than power in the hands of the government.

It crushed the farmers, the NLF, with napalm and defoliants and concentration camps and the Phoenix Program.

"body":"I don't really understand what you're saying here. \n\nFirst point of confusion is what you mean when you say holding certain positions on things alienates a potential base. Are you saying that merely holding these views or having them associated with anarchism is off-putting to folks in right-wing anti-statist political worlds? I mean, I suppose that's true; they are still right-wing.\n\nOr are you saying that expressing sympathy with certain world-views while \"recruiting\" from amongst right-wing libertarians is alienating to them? There's no anarchist consensus on anything beyond a few core tenets, afaik. Regardless, if one were asked about a position on this or that topic, then what would you have one do? Pretend one had no position? Hem and haw about what one's position is? Lie and give an answer palatable to the listener?\n\nSecond point of confusion is where you're getting your information about what right-libertarians find alienating. Is this stuff you've been told by right-libs has dissuaded some of then from considering anarchism, or are you extrapolating from a \"typical\" right-lib and a \"typical\" American anarchist and assuming what would be off-putting? I talk to a moderate number of socially conservative libertarians and haven't had any issues swapping reading recommendations or other material with them, and I'm pretty explicit with my views. I'm not convinced having the views you mentioned does any practical damage to conservative outreach efforts. Being honest about particular views up-front is the more helpful method of speaking with people you disagree with, I suspect and would argue for.\n\nThird, I'm confused with what exactly you think needs to be done based on what you've written. It seems to me that if your concern is solely on gathering people who don't like states, then I don't really see a problem, nor the need to get right-libs to call themselves anarchists or convince them of certain bits of leftist politics.\n\nIf you want more people from white right-libertarian circles calling themselves anarchists, that's a different issue. I've always thought of anarchism more broadly than just anti-state, but as a rejection of conditions that allow for coerced/coercive hierarchy at all levels. This might run a right-wing person into some uncomfortable ideas. Tough; that's part of growing up, running into ideas radically different to ones already ascribed to.\n\nI have more to say - namely about the examples of \"troublesome\" stances you listed and why some of them are hard to avoid, and the others aren't accurate/ubiquitous to anarchist schools of thought, afaik - but this is a lot of text already.

Socialism and Capitalism can work together (at least for a time). Now I don't think that is a good idea as I imagine most anarchists do not. The biggest reason for this not being a good idea is one I heard from Professor Richard D. Wolff who pointed out that under this system, capitalists have a major enemy in this system which is the federal government as it seeks to limit profit. This explains why the capitalist class is the US constantly wants to privatize and shrink the federal government. We should instead seek to move to a complete rejection of capitalism and seek new reforms under some branch of socialism.\n\nAnd it's cool. I can totally see how that would be annoying.

Limiting their freedom of expression now, in specific situations, will prevent far worse limitations for everyone else down the line.

This indicates the majority of the population skew liberal but also are less likely to vote (which may also indicate some of the very foundational perspectives that would make them anarchists - the intuition that representative democracy is ineffective bullshit, for example). \n\n&gt;  the spread of class consciousness is a much more organic process w people themselves reacting to their immediate material conditions instead of being converted by outsiders.\n\nOK, I completely agree with the insider / outsider issue - anarchists shouldn't be like proselytizing Christians, trying to convert people to the religion of anarchism. However, \n\n&gt;  leftists should do everything in their power to make sure centrists, social democrats, etc are not allowed in our circles\n\nis not advocating for organic anarchism, but rather explicitly cutting out potential allies and converts who are within our communities in the first place. Why should we not see liberalism as a natural pathway to anarchism? People are largely a product of their environment - an environment that enforces the sorts of State-supporting attitudes that keep liberals from anarchism.

If you are someone like Malcolm X - you are a black man in the U.S., when you are told you want to study law your white teachers tell you to become a carpenter and be \"realistic.\" Malcom X eventually became a crime boss, then in prison fell in love with the stories of Islam which told a story of a sort of liberation. \n\n&gt; This is what they teach you from kindergarden all the way until you graduate high school.

But if you and your people were steamrolled through history and within your own life by the very people you are looking to build bridges with, they are far more likely to have the response of alienating those people. Peter Gelderloos in *How Non-Violence Protects the State* argues that non-violent anarchists are actually racist for this exact reason - white privileged anarchists can afford to be pacifists when their lives don't depend on revolution, when they *benefit* from the status quo. It's much easier to argue against the chaos of revolution when you are protected by the violence of the State (whether you like it or not), and when your lot in life guarantees security in food, shelter, employment, etc.\n\nWhen you take these fundamental needs away, people become much more radical and willing to fight people like centrists and social democrats so as to liberate themselves from the direct oppression of the State. \n \n\nThat being said, that's a cool and heart-warming story about your mom.

For example: Maybe it is better not putting not-cooperating individuals in prison, but rather treat them with psychotherapy. But who knows? Human psychology is weird, *maybe* this approach works, *maybe* not. This (in particular) isn't even a question that *has* a general answer (that we just don't know), but that has to be decided for every individual (and even then, we can't know the right answer for sure). So you can't objectively say that the idea \"we should treat not-cooperating individuals with psychotherapy instead of prison\" is better than the idea \"we should put not-cooperating individuals in prison\" and vice versa.\n\nHowever, you *can* tell rational arguments from irrational ones. A rational argument might look like: \"We conducted a study with 1000 individuals (500 male, 500 female, all randomly picked from the street from [this] location) and presented them fresh-baked cookies after lunch (all had the same lunch, given [here]), using [this] recipe. 950 individuals liked these cookies, out of which 490 were male and 460 were female. We conclude that with a p-value of x%, males like cookies more than females, at least in [this] region.\"\n\nIrrational arguments come in many forms, for example:\n\n* My aunt hates cookies. Therefore, all females hate cookies. (Group attribution error?, anecdotal fallacy)\n* I heard about uncivilized refugees. Now, I see them everywhere. All refugees must be uncivilized! (Frequency illusion, confirmation bias, group attribution error)\n* The level of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen over the past few decades. The number of pirates declined. We therefore need more pirates again! (Illusory correlation)\n* I heard of this refugee who doesn't work and still gets money from the state. What assholes these refugees are! (Anecdotal evidence, group attribution error, possibly more)\n* Awww, this snake is touching my cheek. It's cuddling with me! Snakes are just like humans. (Antropomorphism)\n\nThere are probably a lot more examples. The human mind has many errors, and cognitive biases and emotions are easy to exploit if the attacked individuals don't know enough about them (and how to recognize them).","created_utc":1522396660,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I'm a big fan of Lucy Parsons and there's this book about her that just came out called \"Goddess of Anarchy\"; I honestly haven't read it yet but I did scan through it and the author seems  pretty thorough in examining her life in great detail. She was a contemporary of Emma Goldman and they had feuds. There's also a book containing her speeches called \"Lucy Parsons: Freedom, Equality &amp; Solidarity - Writings &amp; Speeches, 1878-1937.\" She was really great at giving speeches.\n\nAlso, I recommend \"The Birth of Chinese Feminism\" which is about He-Yin Zhen (I chose her as my username) who was a Chinese anarcha-feminist active during 1900-1910. It contains some obscure articles written by He Zhen and expounds what her views were. The book is long (I've only read parts of it), so I'd suggest just picking a few chapters from there. However, I am critical of some of her views (she was a product of her time) and found her views to be too hetero-normative and anti-free love (she thought monogamy \"between a man and a woman\" was liberation, which didn't take into account polyamory, the LGBTQ community, non-binary folx or sex workers. Emma Goldman would be disappointed in her). I don't know if she was necessarily anti-LGBTQ or anti-sex worker, but she definitely erased them from her analysis and I can't understand why. I just mainly like the way she attacked patriarchy and capitalism. \n\nI also suggest reading or watching anything to do with Mujeres Libres who were a group of Spanish anarchist feminists which became popular during the Spanish Civil War; they had women's spaces, daycare programs and schools. One of the founders, Luc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez Saornil actually met with Emma Goldman. There's also a  1996 movie about them called \"Libertarias.\" (I haven't seen it but it looks good).\n\nHope that helps! Good luck with your anarcha-feminist / non-binary reading group.

It is in your spirit, or it is nowhere.**\n\nThis is a quote from Le Guin's *The Dispossessed*. It summarizes nicely what Kropotkin and others have said, which is essentially that anarchism is only possible by widespread adoption of anarchist values. This is also why *propaganda of the deed* style anarchism from the 19th century is no longer in practice - bombings alienate the public and don't improve social relationships or drastically change social structures. As Kropotkin said:\n\n&gt; structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of explosives.\n\nIt turns out the assumption of the propaganda by the deed were wrong, not everyone was waiting for a chance to rebel. What was realized is that most people are products of the system they live in, so they accept the mainstream values that keep the system going and are not looking for ways to rebel. This means there needs to be more work done to bring consciousness to people about their situations. \n\n\"Doing everything in our power to make sure centrists, social democrats, etc. are not allowed in our circles\" aims to alienate centrists and to treat anarchism more like a political party than a set of values that needs to be shared by everyone. A better practice would be to reach out to centrists, social democrats, etc. and work with them.

"body":"The term libertarian was originally used by anti-authoritarian socialists. It was used for more than 100 years before the American party co-opted it on as a misnomer. In pre-1950's America and currently in the rest of the world libertarianism implies socialism.\n\nIn a similar vein the term Liberalism has been historically used to describe the enlightenment political philosophy of the French and American revolutions, typically defending capitalism and free markets as a vessel of freedom. In the 20th century FDR defended the New Deal as a way to preserve the Liberal *ideal* of freedom even though he wanted to expand government involvement in the 'free' market, and was the first to use it in the modern way the term is understood. Reagan, and following powerful conservatives reinforced this new meaning of the word by using it as an insult.\n\nSo if you're a typical American you probably only understand libertarianism to be free market enthusiasts, liberals are democrats and anyone to the left of them (socialists are liberals right????), and anarchists are people who like to knock over trash cans.\n\nIn academia, and in groups interested in politics, terms like these are often used in their traditional sense so it's confusing to read for laypeople at first but just a little history usually sheds some light. Don't give up on it, just look a little deeper if something doesn't make sense.
