They do not produce (yeah, stereotype here - many homeless have jobs, and do produce), and they don't have money to be consumers (low-level consumers, certainly - I just mean they aren't worth much to the markets). \nThe homeless, then, must be constantly harassed and stigmatized. If it's OK to be homeless (or intentionally poor), which is a strategy to reject capitalism as an individual, then people sick of having a job may just decide it's easier to live off the dumpsters and sleep in the park. It's different if you think the police are going to lock you up for that. And the result either way is good for capitalists - you either get slave labor (at least in the U.S.) by locking up the homeless, or you motivate people to keep in the absurd rat race to a bullshit job in a dehumanizing cubicle.

{"author":"pappapetes","body":"This is my personal experience, so it probably does not apply to everyone.   Here goes:\n\nI was very depressed for a few years, and whenever I would talk about it with friends, or my dad, and eventually a therapist, it would come back to me voicing a world view similar to what you just described.  I saw a world in which pretty much every inch had been mapped, divided, owned, and exploited for profit.  I saw the suffering and inequality that was the result of those practices.   In my mind, this was the source of the depression.  \n\nWhat the therapist helped me realize was that I had the cause and effect mixed up.   While those things are true, I was fixated on them because I had developed a negative pattern of thinking that always led me to return that place.   More than that, as time went on and I spent more time in that negative place I felt increasingly isolated from my friends, family and pretty much everyone.  The isolation and negative thinking was really the thing keeping me locked in the depression, not the state of the world.  \n\nSo, to answer your question, a therapist can help give you strategies to separate the state of the world from your internal world and mental health.   If we\u2019re being honest, the world has always been a shit place with tons of human suffering and injustice.  Despite that, people live and have lived healthy fulfilling lives, and it\u2019s not as simple as calling them brainwashed.   To paraphrase a Buddhist idea, you can be your own refuge.  If your internal happiness is entirely dependent on external circumstances, then you\u2019ll always be at the mercy of outside forces.  ","created_utc":1535807616,"score":55,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Chuzzwazza","body":"They would use a method of therapy like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) that is pretty much context-neutral?\n\nThe general idea of CBT (AFAIK) is that certain ways of thinking can be unhealthy mainly because they're unrealistic, such as \"I failed that test so I must be an idiot who will never do anything right\". The idea isn't instead to just think *positively* as such, like \"I failed that test but I'm still so smart and nothing else will ever go wrong\" (which is just as unhealthy) -- but realistically (so as to be constructive), like \"I failed that test, but it was probably due to my lack of study, and one failure doesn't write off my entire future, I just have to study more for the next one\". It also explores how different ways of thinking can in turn impact emotion and behaviour, to demonstrate the effects of thinking realistically like this. On top, it's usually accompanied by additional tidbits, like in the \"failed a test\" example, the therapist would help you draw up a study timetable and work out a good studying environment, so that you have a solid plan of action.\n\nYou could easily apply this particular methodology to unhealthy thoughts about leftist politics; it's obvious already that your way of thinking there is unhealthily negative and reductive. You present the idea that \"society is rotten, nobody else sees it like I do, and I can't do anything about it\" as if it's some revolutionary new thought that therapists will be dumbfounded to hear, and then offer a false dichotomy where the therapist is useless either way.\n\nCBT is clinically effective for a variety of mental health issues, but maybe CBT doesn't work for you?

{"author":"DatParadox","body":"I've had depression pretty much all my life and I'm not sure how this is dismissive. The post never states medicine doesn't work, it states that medicine doesn't fix the material conditions that can cause or greatly affect one's mental health issues.\n\nThis post just expands the understanding of depression to a systematic level, and for many of us, we have been forced to go through years of antidepressants and other medicines that have caused a lot of trauma because the greater medical community has a \"medicine first, wellness second\" approach in a lot of places that ignore the greater abuse of the system and instead focuses solely on \"chemical imbalance;\" which, as this post is saying rather than dismissing, is either only one factor or not a factor at all.\n\nThis is especially relevant to people with marginalized identities, and, at least where I'm from, many of us share the same story of antidepressants being not only worthless, but actively detrimental to our mental health. Our depression goes beyond our brain and worldview, and often stems from active oppression and discrimination on top of what capitalism makes all of us deal with, and the lack of resources and institutional community to support us for what we need. \n\nThis isnt saying antidepressants can't help, because plenty of people are helped by them. This post doesn't explicitly state that but neither does it state the opposite, and it's disconcerting that it's seen as \"dismissive\" just because someone is sharing a different view of depression and what could be a cure or vastly help, when they aren't discounting the effects of medicine.\n\nEdit: As a caveat, I think understand where you are coming from by finding it as dismissive. I hope my explanation helped (and I didn't come off as hostile), as more often than not people like me and our understanding of depression is dismissed outside of our community. Whereas many people (not you, but the many in the medical community and those who support it) think medicine is the help, what we need is have community support, solidarity, access to helpful physical\/mental care, a culture where our bodies aren't shamed, etc. And of course, as said, medicine can help some of us cope with that better than others, but for many of us it's counterproductive.

Realizing the root causes has helped me stop that, but I still need the medication so I don\u2019t slip back into it. It\u2019s hard to use sound reason with myself when my emotions and anxiety are out of control. I exaggerate the bad situations and I can\u2019t see the good in anything or a way out, and it hurts my relationships with the people I love: which to me is the most important part of my life, something I refuse to let capitalism take from me.\n\nThere\u2019s no quick fix. You can\u2019t start a revolution today and fix everyone\u2019s depression. It\u2019s true that bad circumstances increase depression, but you still have to treat it. Work can also be hard on our physical bodies, but we still treat our ailments. I realize a societal overhaul is necessary, but people are sick in the here and now. Even after a revolution people will still have trauma in their lives.\n\nIf your doctor or therapist suggests that there\u2019s just a chemical imbalance with no outside causes, it\u2019s time to get a new doctor or therapist. There are a lot of bad ones just like there are people that aren\u2019t good at their job in any field. \n\nAlso what works for one person may not work for another.

{"author":"Grnrchst","body":"[Matt4Michigan](http:\/\/www.matt4michigan.com\/)\n\n&gt; August 19, 2018: Matt Kuehnel receives provisional endorsement (pending national party approval) from the Socialist Party of Michigan. It was the first time any LP candidate achieved this. \n\n&gt;  I was born and raised in Metro-Detroit, living most of my life in Macomb County. My father worked hard to provide us a great life, and, though my family isn't perfect, my siblings and I were very lucky to be raised in such a loving environment. I was taught to love, to give, and to fight for what's right. I had a natural resistance to blindly follow authority or to value popularity over human kindness. I struggled in life, turning to drugs and alcohol at a young age. I had trouble in school and later with the law. I've been poor, I've been homeless, I've been on the run from the law, I've been in jail. Almost 8 years ago, with support of my family, I was able to recover, get a college degree, establish a career in heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration, get married, own our first home. I understand that many don't have the same resources and support I was blessed with. I want to provide support, be an example of the positive difference one life can make, no matter how insignificant you may feel. I want the all of the residents and visitors Michigan to be afforded the same opportunities I've been given.\n\n&gt; I embrace the spirit of individualism, the sense of community of humanitarianism, and the sense of duty to future generations to provide for them a safe, loving, and liberating future that revolutions are born of. I want to see our society end its dehumanizing necessity to compete, and develop an empowering conviction to cooperation. I believe that necessities like food, water, shelter, education, and healthcare are not goods to be profited from, but human rights. I believe today, more than ever, through technologies like automation, computer engineering, 3-D printing, and renewable energy, we are at a point in society where all of these needs could be met without a massive, often exploited, manual labor workforce. I believe that all too often progress is stalled in the name of personal greed, and our resources are directed toward sustaining inequality instead of advancing humanity. I believe that we can do better for our future generations.\n\n&gt; I will be strive to elevate the voices of those so often unrepresented. I will fight corruption. I will put Michigan's resources back into the hands of Michigan's people. I will fight for strong unions. I will fight to end racial, sexual, and gender disparities. I will fight to end policing and the incarceration of our family members. I will fight to ensure everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security. I will fight all barriers to entry and make Michigan a sanctuary state for all seeking shelter and prosperity. I will fight for the youth who are left without a voice in our political system. I will always be transperant, honest, and accountable. I will hold others to the same standard. I will be your voice in Lansing.\n\n&gt; Gun violence is all too common these days. Many are calling for common sense gun control, and I agree. The unfortunate reality is that guns do exist, and because of this, individuals do have a need to carry a gun to defend themselves. My proposal would be to disarm those that are statistically the biggest perpetrators of gun violence and transfer the weapons to persecuted minorites, including people of color, gender and sexual minorities, homeless, and felons. An armed, trained, and prepared community is a responsive and safe community. This will hopefully direct us toward a world where the brutality of police is not needed, and community safety can consist of medical professionals trained in de-escalation and harm prevention.\n\n&gt; Michigan is especially vunerable to the oppressive arms of border and immigration enforcement being both a peninsula and a port of entry for many immigrants. The practice of restricting free migration is inherently discrimitory and a violation of basic human rights. I propose to make Michigan a sanctuary state, expelling all federal agencies from enforcing injustice within our jurisdiction. This doesn't just apply to Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE), but should apply to all federal agencies that restrict our individual and economic freedom. It's time Michigan stands up, reclaims its independence, decides its own paths, and protects those that seek shelter within our communities.\n\n&gt; The US is one of the few industrialized countries that does not ensure that individuals can receive necessary medical treatment. Many cannot afford the high price of the private market, and millions are saddled with outrageous premiums, deductibles, and bills. The market has been monopolized by a handful of private companies colluding with federal, state, and local legislatures. Medicare For All would break up those monopolies and ensure that nobody goes without care. There is a high probability that it will not be a perfect solution, and we should work toward direct care and mutual aide solutions to maximize efficiency and choices, but Medicare For All is the only option currently being presented that would reduce the harm the private model has encouraged.\n\n&gt; Proto-fascist political formations are increasingly emergent in the United States. Fascism appears in tough economic times and tries to scapegoat minorities, pitting neighbor against neighbor.The economic troubles we face are the direct result of a carefully planned capitalist economy which enriches the wealthy and exploits the working class. I will remain dedicated to opposing, exposing, and dismantling oppressive state structures that sustain and fuel racism, bigotry, misogyny, xenophobia, and ableism.\n\n&gt; Private property is displayed and upheld in title ownership of land and resources. It is the system that upholds over 200 years of injustice that was established through a genocide of indigenous people, that was restricted to the white owning class for a whole century and built off of slavery and prejudice. Private property has empowered a real estate market controlled by banks and investment firms, leaving three million US citizens homeless while an estimated eighteen million homes lay vacant, with an esitmated thirteen million of those homes held by banks. This purposeful scarcity artificially created to drive up prices leads to real world harm. It is also the system that allows for giant conglomerates and corporations to control mass amounts of resource, both industrial and natural, leading to unfair wage agreements and union busting. The only solution is to give individuals sole control over their shelter, workers sole control over their labor, and communities some control over their natural resources.\n","created_utc":1535820208,"score":26,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Namely, that the use of crypto is said to be too diverse and dispersed to constitute an real uprising. This is a collectivist view of revolution that postulates the need for a common cause and consciousness. Crypto does not have either. A user in Venezuela, who is desperate to hedge the inflation of fiat, is not politically the same as a user in Germany, who profits from converting one crypto to another. They do not share goals or communicate. How can they form a revolution?\n\nEasily. Consider the printing press. Like crypto, it caused a revolution through technology that allowed people to escape a monopoly of authority; with the printing press, it was the monopoly that state and church held on knowledge. Many technological breakthroughs, like the telephone, do not threaten authority. But the printing press and crypto invaded areas that the status quo considered to be their prerogatives.\n\nWhen Gutenberg engineered an affordable and manageable means by which average people could mass-produce documents, then opinions, propaganda, and information exploded. The material printed had different goals, and publications often contradicted each other. The books and pamphlets were issued in dozens of nations and languages; often, they had been translated by people who did not know or coordinate with the original author. And, yet, everyone was part of the same revolution that gave birth to the Enlightenment. The revolution was freedom of speech through which average people were empowered by printing and reading material that they deemed to be in their self-interest. The revolution in free speech and knowledge occurred from the cumulative impact of the decentralized self-interest of strangers.\n\nRevolutions do not need to be centralized.","created_utc":1535826176,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"HammersAndAnvils","body":"Was just reading some Graeber yesterday (*Possibilities*, pg. 27):\n\n&gt;Needless to say, the higher up in the taxonomic hierarchy the representative, the more *tapu* \\[in the Maori usage\\] he was said to have. But it's here that things become interesting, because... it's precisely in the notion of *tapu* that the element of exclusion comes back in. What this means is that the greater the purview of any given representative, the more inclusive the group he was seen to represent, the more he himself was set apart from everyone else, including other members of his own clan or lineage. As the head of clan, I stand for everyone else in the clan - especially, in dealings with outsiders. They are thus in a sense 'included' in my political persona. But this in turn makes me a higher, more 'exclusive' sort of person, fir to interact on an equal footing with other clan chiefs like myself, perhaps, but not with those included in me. And of course the status of the head of a tribe is even more exclusive.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A moment's reflection will make it clear that something along these lines happens almost everywhere society is organized into more and more inclusive groups. If those groups have representatives (barons, dukes, and kings; mayors, governors, and presidents), then those representatives will also be set off against those they represent as members of more and more exclusive categories of people. The higher the group they represent in the taxonomic hierarchy, the more abstract and universal they themselves are seen to be; hence, the more they are set off against the world - including those they represent.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is easy to see how this logic could eventually lead to something like an ideology of social class. But it might also help explain some otherwise rather odd consistencies in the way people think about class. How often, for instance, does one head the upper classes of some society or other described as more refined and elegant than those below them, finer in features, more tactful and disciplined in their emotions? Or hear that the older orders are cruder, coarser in features as in manners - but at the same time more free with their feelings, more spontaneous? Most people seem to consider it a matter of course that upper and lower strata of society should differ in this way (if they think about it at all, perhaps  they write it off to conditions of health, work, and leisure), or at least, that they should be represented so. In fact, such stereotypes even recur in times and places - say, much of early Medieval Europe - where the upper stratum could equally well be represented as a gang of heavily armed thugs exerting protection from a population of helpless farmers.\n\nAlso Proudhon, describing his deputation to the National Assembly (quoted in Marshall's *Demanding the Impossible*, pg. 244):\n\n&gt;As soon as I set foot in the parliamentary Sinai, I ceased to be in touch with the masses; because I was absorbed by me legislative work, I entirely lost sight of the current of events... One must have lived in that isolator which is called the National Assembly to realize how the men who are most completely ignorant of the state of the country are almost always those who represent it... fear of the people is the sickness of all those who belong in authority; the people, for those in power, are the enemy.\n\nAlso Malatesta, *Anarchy* (from *An Errico Malatesta Reader: The Method of Freedom*):\n\n&gt;Anarchists... have made use, and still generally make use of the word State, meaning thereby all that collection of institutions, political, legislative, judicial, military, financial, etc., by means of which the management of their own affairs, the guidance of their personal conduct and the care of ensuring their own safety are taken from the people and confided to certain individuals. And these, whether by usurpation or delegation \\[!\\], are invested with the right to make laws over and for all, and to constrain the public to respect them, making use fo the collective force of the community to this end. \\[Pg. 111.\\]\n\n\u200b\n\n&gt;A government, that is, a number of persons deputed to make the laws, and entitled to make use of the collective forces of society to make every individual to respect these laws, already constitutes a class privileged and separated from the rest of the community. Such a class, like every elected body, will seek instinctively to enlarge its powers; to place itself above the controls of the people; to impose its tendencies, and to make its own interests predominate. Placed in a privileged position, the government always finds itself in antagonism to the masses, of whose force it disposes. \\[Pg. 130.\\]\n\nRepublicanism betrays, disempowers, and subjugates the people, is antithetical to most anarchist thinking, is authoritarian than libertarian, aristocratic than non-hierarchical, and should be abolished with all top-down forms of government, or government itself. This isn't worth celebrating, unless it's an attempt to undermine or destroy a political party.\n\n\\[EDIT: typo.\\]","created_utc":1535829974,"score":8,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"TaleRecursion","body":"Thank you for your answer. It very much hits home. You are right in suggesting that the state of the world only affects me inasmuch as I remain fixated on it and keep cultivating negative \/ pessimistic though patterns. This is entirely true. I would even venture that, at least in my case, being depressed about the state of the world is a matter of conscious choice. This may sound absurd, but let me explain.\n\nI have been down this rabbit hole a certain number of times over the years, each time from a different angle, and always ended up at the exact same conclusion that the crippling sadness and dread I am feeling at the thought of the unspeakable horrors that are allowed to be perpetuated in the world even to this day, is the only emotional reaction that is honest and right. This may sound like I am just being complacent about my mental state, and trying to rationalize it, but believe me, it is not so.\n\nInitially, I was feeling helpless and tried many different methods to help mitigating the feeling of dread, I started meditation, tried different medications, had long discussions with close relatives and paradoxically, all of that worked and has consistently helped me move away for a while from the gloom and the darkness, and getting back to my happier self. But always, deep inside, something didn't feel right, some voice was calling. That voice, I soon realized, was my conscience. Deep inside, I knew that what I was doing was not right and that I shouldn't be contributing so willingly to this monstruous and murderous machine that we call \"society\". By living happy and carefree, by being a \"productive\" member of society, by consumming, by being \"reasonable\"  I was in fact indirectly and passively giving my consent to the unspeakable horrors that are being done in my name and on my behalf by my government.\n\nYou referred to a buddhist idea in your reply, and I concur. Not only are you your own shelter, but the actual \"you\" doesn't even need a shelter given how it essentially is only pure and unadulterated consciousness. All the neuroses are part of the ego and stream of thoughts which, when practicing meditation, you rapidly realize aren't actually you. But even buddhism recognizes that although the practice of meditation and introspection will initially allow you to free yourself from most of the direct causes of suffering, as you make your way forward in the way it becomes clear that the awareness of other people's suffering becomes in itself a form of suffering, making compassion the ultimate path toward actual enlightenment. Buddhism embodies these two levels into two schools of thoughts referred to as the \"small vehicle\" (hinayana) and \"large vehicle\" (mahayana). The difference between the two is that followers of the hinayana will typically follow the way for their own sake and pursue the route of least suffering whereas followers of the mahayana will typically undertake to take upon themselves some of other people's suffering in a bid to help these people suffer less. Some of the suffering that followers of mahayana are immediately faced with is the deep sadness that comes with watching in the eyes the misery of the world and trying to help with it.\n\nOver the years, I have slowly come to the realization that existential depression, what St. John of the Cross was calling the \"dark night of the soul\", is not actually a mental disorder but a natural process of transformation of the mind that gets triggered when one becomes aware that something is wrong and incongruent in their life or the world at large and that change is needed. Depression has been a harsh teacher, but without it I would probably still be slaving on at my former Wall Street job blissfully unaware of the fraudulent machine I was a part of, I would know nothing of buddhism and epistemology, and wouldn't have become an anarchist. in retrospect if I was given the opportunity to go back in time and avoid the realization that pushed me over the edge, I would still choose to take the red pill. My depression is now part of who I am, and although I may not be the happy and carefree person I used to be, I am at peace with myself and know that I will carry on with this process until it has completed its transformational role and eventually goes away.\n\nTo conclude, here is a mental experiment: imagine that suddenly the entire world population was to start feeling deeply sad and depressed about the horrors governments all over the world have been engaging in, and fixating on it. How long do you think it would take for statism to end? Would that be a good thing? Would you say that the entire world population has suddenly lost its mind or would you rather say that the entire world population has actually awakened?","created_utc":1535838123,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Lost_Geometer","body":"As far as I can tell the primary effects of the shift from more socialist (not anarchist!) policies towards more capitalist ones have been massive exploitation of resources to produce goods not directly tied to human welfare and the concentration of control over those goods and resources into the hands of a small number of people. This is more or less the predictable result of capitalism. True, as a side effect goods that support basic needs, such as food, shelter, and health also became more available. But that is strictly a side effect, as can be seen by the small proportion of economic activity directly addressing these needs, in comparison to the number of people still suffering from malnourishment or preventable diseases, for example. So several critiques are obvious.\n\nTo start with, one recognizes that the definition of poverty is rigged from the start, presupposing that the goal of human existence can be assigned a monetary value. Of course the primary mode of human existence is social, and people routinely sacrifice their money, health, and even lives for social advancement. Thus we should consider poverty to be as much a social relation as a material one. Your question does not in any way address the social  side of poverty, and advocates of capitalism seldom do. In the examples of China and India mentioned most measures of economic  inequality have increased consistently (as expected) over the past 40 years, though this is only a course measure of the situation on the ground. In particular one can applaud the weakening of the Indian caste system. Nonetheless, following the spirit of your question from now on I focus only on material poverty (lack of resources to meet basic needs).\n\nAny claim that capitalism is the best way of addressing poverty strikes me as rather dubious given the comparative paucity of resources assigned to mitigating it. There is really no reason for any people to be malnourished: rather the market has decided that selling individually wrapped prunes to the middle-class is a better use of resources than selling unwrapped prunes to poor people. There is no reason, other than the rather perverse actions of an invisible hand, for a town to spend all their resources on producing fidget spinners when the workers are slowly dying from hookworm infestation. At the best of times markets simply chase Pareto optimality, and can't value human needs. There is no fundamental reason to believe that capitalism helps material poverty. The only argument ever given is the correlation between the two over the past century or so.\n\nBut wither this correlation? As said, the primary effect of the capitalistic shift has been massive resource consumption. Coupled with population growth (an unintended side effect of reducing material poverty!) these general economic patterns are unsustainable. Just look at curves for population, energy consumption, etc.. Not only is there no reason to believe that correlations touted by pro-capitalists will continue much longer there is every reason to believe that modern industrial society will lead to the greatest disaster in human history.\n\nI apologize for only addressing the capitalism side of your question here.  I have my doubts whether anarchism can address global economic questions well. In that sense only I can support some form of socialism, but that's a much more complicated question, for a different time, and it's late here.","created_utc":1535845970,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"era--vulgaris","body":"The idea of anarchism as a philosophy advocating chaos and disorder is the oldest (intentional) misunderstanding of anarchist thought in existence. It's also the most propagandistic characterization of anarchism that is used as a trope not just in corporate news media or establishment opinion, but also in film, television and storytelling (see any action movie\/novel plot involving anarchist terrorists, or the particularly demonstrative and idiotic \"The Purge\" series of films). \n\nMost schools of anarchism actually value structures more than non-anarchist schools of thought- the difference being that in most forms of anarchism, structures must be as voluntary and democratic in formation as possible, and the formation of permanent power or tyranny must be able to be curtailed on any level of social organization. Because bureaucracies and hierarchies are *inherently* negative to anarchist philosophy, social structures must be much more functional and cogent than when power structures (state, church, business, moneyed interests) can simply *impose* dictates on others. \n\nOf course there are anarchists who think a bit closer to what the text describes- immature people who believe the myth and want to create that kind of dystopia, anarcho-capitalists of certain stripes- but the history of anarchist thought, movements, arguments and alliances is vastly swayed towards anarchism as an alternative vision of society where hierarchy and authority are seen as inherently suspect, rather than a lack of society in general and brutal power structures running things rather than a state. \n\nYou're reading a highly ideological text- note the complete certainty the author has that as authority declines, chaos and disorder result, regardless of the circumstances in which authority is removed or diminished.

{"author":"snoopduck29","body":"\"The whole process of acquiring civic rights is not very different from that of being admitted to membership of an automobile club, for instance. A person files his application. It is examined. It is sanctioned. And one day the man receives a card which informs him that he has become a citizen. The information is given in an amusing way. An applicant who has hitherto been a Zulu or Kaffir is told: \"By these presents you are now become a German Citizen.\" \r\nThe President of the State can perform this piece of magic. What God Himself could not do is achieved by some Theophrastus Paracelsus (Note 16) of a civil servant through a mere twirl of the hand. Nothing but a stroke of the pen, and a Mongolian slave is forthwith turned into a real German. Not only is no question asked regarding the race to which the new citizen belongs; even the matter of his physical health is not inquired into. His flesh may be corrupted with syphilis; but he will still be welcome in the State as it exists to-day so long as he may not become a financial burden or a political danger. In this way, year after year, those organisms which we call States take up poisonous matter which they can hardly ever overcome. \r\nAnother point of distinction between a citizen and an alien is that the former is admitted to all public offices, that he may possibly have to do military service and that in return he is permitted to take a passive or active part at public elections. Those are his chief privileges. For in regard to personal rights and personal liberty the alien enjoys the same amount of protection as the citizen, and frequently even more. Anyhow that is how it happens in our present German Republic. I realize fully that nobody likes to hear these things. But it would be difficult to find anything more illogical or more insane than our contemporary laws in regard to State citizenship. \r\nAt present there exists one State which manifests at least some modest attempts that show a better appreciation of how things ought to be done in this matter. It is not, however, in our model German Republic but in the U.S.A. that efforts are made to conform at least partly to the counsels of commonsense. By refusing immigrants to enter there if they are in a bad state of health, and by excluding certain races from the right to become naturalized as citizens, they have begun to introduce principles similar to those on which we wish to ground the People's State.\"\n- Hitler","created_utc":1535853236,"score":8,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

All of these can coexist in a single space and maximize production.\nFor example, a fig tree could be grown with a grape vine climbing up it, a pawpaw tree below it, a blueberry bush underneath that, rhubarb below that, miners lettuce covering the ground and beets growing amongst it. And that would all just be in about a 10ft by 10ft area, with many adjacent groupings all with different plants, also different plants have different advantages and can help other plants grow better, like beans fix nitrogen in the soil and help plants like corn that need more nitrogen to grow, and certain plants repel pests like aphids from plants that are vulnerable when planted nearby.

{"author":"Chuzzwazza","body":"You're both mostly right, but there's another important aspect to wealth like this which we should keep in mind -- power. A person may not necessarily be able to cash out for the full theoretical money value of their stocks, but owning such a significant amount of stocks grants them power over the company (and by extension, its employees) as a shareholder.\n\nBezos is both Amazon's number-one shareholder and its CEO, which gives him near-dictatorial power over the nearly 600 thousand people that the company employs. He can essentially make or break peoples' livelihoods as he sees fit, as long as he doesn't piss the other shareholders off too much. He can also leverage his position to influence politicians in order to shape legislative policy. Why should a person be able to acquire such power over others, especially through private property rather than democracy?\n\nA good example is freedom of speech: we all agree that a democratically-elected liberal government should have limitations to stop any infringements on their citizens' rights, but someone like Bezos is pretty much free to do what he wants with his employees (outside some particular extremes). If we believe in democracy, freedom, and equality in government, why not in the workplace? Why are such huge and influential international organisations (which are often integral to many peoples' lives) essentially run like dictatorships or monarchies?\n\nThe usual excuse is that it's okay because you're free to work somewhere else, but that's a half-truth at best. We also wouldn't accept that kind of excuse for a government being dictatorial -- who would say \"if you don't like being oppressed, you're free to live in another country\"? Furthermore, even when people do manage to escape shitty authoritarian governments... Well, those are called refugees, and a lot of people still don't treat them well at all. In the same vein, people who do try to escape shitty employers like Amazon or Walmart, well, they'd usually need a good social safety net to do that, and guess what?

And when I say \u201cproblem\u201d I mean something the person themselves identifies as a problem...not something societally imposes.\n\nSmoking cessation(and other habits), neurotransmitter imbalances resulting in disturbing hallucinations,delusions and disordered thoughts, cyclic self doubt, crippling anxiety and depression. If it were easy to fix by yourself, or with family and friends...people would do that. \n\nLike I said my wife is a trained therapist, I\u2019m working on it, we suffered from ocd and major depression. We both tried to self therapy, we tried to help each other, it was not a case of societal expectations (though those worsened our experience) it is a matter of our brain chemistry.  In several cases even what was recommended by other therapists was wrong...though intuitive..my natural inclination,and that of my wife\u2019s first therapist for her ocd was to reassure her and try to logic away here anxiety...it wasn\u2019t until she went to a specialist who practiced exposure response prevention that she saw any kind of symptom reduction.  She has fewer symptoms now than she did as a 3 year old! And just to clarify ocd  (as she has it) works by way of the brain firing off dopamine at the wrong times...causing the person to attach undo significance to aspects of experience, over time it leads to delusions and fixations that can ruin the relationships with these friends and loved ones you speak about. It can be highly alienating. She and I both, because of the stake we had in the relationship were pretty shitty help for each other(though we remained loving and supportive). We will never live as \u201cnormal people\u201d we will always have to live a \u201crecovery lifestyle\u201d but that is so that we can be happy and whole...not so we can be better workers.\n\nYes, we need increased awareness of neurodiversity. Yes, we need to eliminate money from human interactions.  Yes we need to make sure that people who work as helpers are not in it for the wrong reason, and yes we need to hold helpers to high standards of practice to prevent assholes from slipping in. Yes, we need to shift away from a drugs first medical interventionist societal function view of mental health toward wellness.\n\nBut we do not need to abolish therapy.  I\u2019m an anarchist, yes I have to eat and so I work for cash(but always in human services so that my work is meaningful) I do not support the cops, I do not support the military, I do not support the state or any hierarchy.  I will not find other work because people(maybe not you) have found my work to be helpful and liberating.  I posted initially not to attack op, or you in my responses to you, not out of a place of needing to justify my views or prop up a system of power\/exploitation, but because I did not want readers of this sub to suffer needlessly by adhering to the (privileged) position  that they can just deal with aversive mental states on their own(implied: if they can\u2019t then they are just too broken or failures).  Can you make your own toaster from scratch? Maybe if you are an electrician and have access to specialist crafting materials...if not, then you need help. If you cannot deal with painful intrusive thoughts or states of mind your family and friends may help you, they may hurt you (even if they mean well), but a therapist has specific knowledge and experience that increase the likelihood of you getting what you need. \n\nTherapy has been turned into something exploitative by some, but at its root it is anarchist or at least anarchist friendly.(two humans come together voluntarily for a purpose, ones shares his\/her knowledge and skills to help the other achieve their goals - anything outside of this is a big not a feature)","created_utc":1535918783,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"MK_BECK","body":"Lol, I very well might. Changes in the algorithm often greatly change what kind of content makes it to the top of the frontpage. How long posts get to stay high-ranked depending on how many upvotes it gets etc. Reddit is by far the most simplistic of such a system, since each user only upvotes or downvotes and the algorithm basically only depreciates the \"value\" of upvotes over time. \n\nBut the karma system itself is rigged to favor certain types of content. Just because the system takes a user input doesn't mean the output can be called \"the will of the people\". If for example, you only allowed each user 10 upvotes per day, that would greatly change  what makes it to the frontpage don't you think? Both the system of unlimited upvotes and the system of limited upvotes, take every users opinion into account, but might get very different outputs. So the system is not neutral, the output can't be the \"will of the people\", since there can't possibly be two different \"wills of the people.\"\n\nI could go on. But to make the comparison to capitalism clear, every persons opinion on what should get made has *some* influence in a capitalist system as long as they have money. But if, let's say, the means of production were controlled through direct democracy, that would still be the case, but might give vastly different results.","created_utc":1535971046,"score":18,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Dinglydell","body":"The difference is it's necessarily to buy goods in real life, but it isn't necessary to upvote a comment.\n\nYou can try all you like to avoid unethical consumption but you can never escape it, because it's everywhere - and the fact of the matter is you *have* to buy at least some goods just to survive. Besides which, companies have a vested interest in hiding their dodgy business practices because they know that if it were common knowledge it'd harm their sales, making it hard to even determine what products are \"ethical\". Furthermore, each product has a mountain of companies involved in its supply chain. Do you really think it's feasible for everyone to do research into the business practices of every single product they buy? Especially when the information is hard to find because, as I said, they like to hide it. You'd be in the shops for a week before you've come to a decision.\n\nAnd even if you *could* determine the business practices of every single company involved in the supply chain, many people don't have enough money to be able to make a choice anyway. They just have to go with the cheapest option.\n\nAnd even if you did get everybody to shop \"ethically\", the only effect this would have is shoving the dodgy business practices underground. Because it's still profitable to use them, all you've done is raised the cost of getting caught.

That is, anarchists stand in opposition to systems of power and exchange in which individuals cannot *truly* opt out of.\n\nEugenics is a system in which some individuals are deemed unworthy of reproduction. It doesn't matter how \"scientific\" or \"future-minded\" you are about that process, it's inherently dictatorial. Let's take hereditary diseases for an example. Which diseases do we select to remove? That alone is a large question. How many people with illnesses say, at the end of it, that their lives weren't worth it? And do we only count the voices of those suffering from said diseases, or do we allow everyone to vote? What, also, is the motivation for removing such diseases from our gene pool? Is it to prevent the suffering of the ill, or to save us the burden of caring for them? If it's to prevent the suffering of the ill, then it should be based on their desire to curb the potential of the disease(s), in which case they may abstain from reproducing on their own. If it's to reduce the burden on the caretakers\/society, then perhaps you should revisit some of the basic ideals of anarchism, because caring for the community and sharing burdens is a big part of that.\n\nIf what you mean by \"eugenics\" is actually genetic manipulation of sperm and egg cells to eliminate certain detrimental traits, I'm pretty sure there's another word for that, maybe genetic engineering, though maybe there's a more specific term. Either way, if individuals cannot reasonably opt out of this process (submitting themselves for the processes, however invasive), then I would say it would not stand up to anarchist scrutiny.","created_utc":1536012429,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"libertarian-july-19","body":"One reason why the Spanish have persecuted Anarchist educational establishments before the civil war, they actually tied to teach people in a humane way focusing on individual needs and tailoring the education to be good for everyone. A participatory, inclusive, non hierarchical education system where it's actually fun to learn would be needed.\n\nLet me tell you my educational experiences. We got along with our classmates most of the time, quite liberal people. There was a little bit of bullying and machismo and mysoginy, but mostly we got along. Interestingly there was no racism that I remember, even though we were a diverse class. We elected a student council so things ran democratically in a consensus basis to address issues, and it worked fine and we weren't even anarchists, we had no idea about politics at all, totally kept in the dark in that aspect, but we behaved like anarchists without even knowing it, and the bullying and mysoginy was later getting addressed and in the last year we resolved pretty much all conflict and were pretty friendly to eachother.\n\nNow talking about teachers, that is just another fucking dimension.\n\nAll teachers have spewed the same patriotic nationalist garbage, all of them, even female ones. The teacher of literature was literally fetishizing past nationalist poems and shit like that. Obviously we didn't bite on that, but they were totally detached from this world.\n\nMale teachers were smug, authoritarian patriarchs with slight racist biases, and horrible fucking misoginy. One of the teacher was almost like starting to flirt with the girls after we got 18 during class, just to show their masculinity.\n\nAll teachers demanded unquestionable obedience, you could get failed if you talked back or questioned them. You can't question authority folks.\n\nAnd they were just so boring and repetitive, some of them yelled a lot, others have abused their authority constantly, like punishing us for small things just because they had a bad mood.\n\nSo there's that, school is just an authoritarian indoctrination system in the current form. I am not even going to talk about the curriculum how bad it was (literally the entire history of the labor movement was just erased, I haven't even known who Marx was until after my 20's).\n\nAbolish fucking authority and hierarchical school systems and make education participatory, equal and enjoyable.","created_utc":1536020666,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"cyclingsocialist","body":"&gt; Eugenics, the selection of desired heritable characteristics in order to improve future generations, typically in reference to humans. The term eugenics was coined in 1883 by British explorer and natural scientist Francis Galton, who [...] advocated a system that would allow \u201cthe more suitable races or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable.\u201d\n\n[Source](https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/science\/eugenics-genetics)  \nHow exactly would one go about making a system of eugenics that would actually be effective if there was reasonable choice for those being asked not to have children? There is a precedent of forced sterilization (began in the United States) that accompanies the eugenics position, and if you're arguing that the word *eugenics* doesn't imply that it is a forced system, the burden of showing how that would be possible is on you, because otherwise all we have to look at is the history of eugenics.\n\nIn [this video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/lMbvtmb79N0?t=30m10s) Peter Coffin talks about how the expansion of reproductive autonomy and rights, the access to quality care and technologies is a more socially equitable solution to \"undesirable hereditary traits.\" Yes, many people opt out of having children on their own. Hell, many of those people are *women* who, until relatively recently, didn't have reliable access to birth control and therefore had little autonomy in that sense.\n\nThe other thing you're talking about is called \"gene editing\" and also \"genetic screening.\" Both are currently elective procedures, and I don't have a problem with them, so long as they're elective. But, again, as someone who does not suffer from any hereditary diseases, I'm not making value judgments on the lives of people who do. \n\n&gt; One complication of genetic testing for the purpose of disease eradication is that, in practice, a particular ethnic group will likely be involved due to shared ancestry.  For instance, Tay-Sachs disease is significantly more common in certain Jewish communities.  Tay-Sachs is a genetic disease that causes a deterioration of mental and physical abilities and results in death by age four. Eradicating Tay-Sachs will require screening all individuals in the affected population. However, a public campaign to test all individuals of Jewish descent for Tay-Sachs carrier status may for some recall the racist motivations of eugenicists in the early 20th century, particularly those associated with Nazi Germany. Also, racial stereotypes or biases may be reinforced if genetic testing performed on individuals of an ethnic group reveals a predisposition to a particular disease or condition.\n\n[Source](http:\/\/knowgenetics.org\/is-eugenics-happening-today\/)  \nI think that sums up why even good intentions behind genetic screening or editing (rather than selective breeding) puts a bad taste in people's mouth.","created_utc":1536070020,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Debt erasure in this modern context isn't likely to look like previous iterations of the past, for example most people aren't debtors farming someone else's land to survive anymore. I guess the equivalent modern debt is for college degrees - which are the barrier to employment. Houses and land aren't farmed individually anymore, and since the [Green Revolution](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Green_Revolution) in the 1950s and '60s, the number of farmers in the U.S. has dropped drastically. \n\nBesides, we don't have single rulers - it's harder for the rulers to erase debts now, since it requires some amount of agreement between rulers, whereas before the King would do it, and the consequences of not doing it was the King losing his head. \n\nInstead of debt erasure, we need to eradicate capital and ensure the public is educated and capable of being \"citizens\" (not of a State, but of a local community - that people can cooperate and contribute to society responsibly).

The initiatives resulted in the adoption of new technologies, including, high-yielding varieties (HYVs) of cereals, especially dwarf wheats and rices, in association with chemical fertilizers and agro-chemicals, and with controlled water-supply (usually involving irrigation) and new methods of cultivation, including mechanization. All of these together were seen as a 'package of practices' to supersede 'traditional' technology and to be adopted as a whole.Both the Ford Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation were heavily involved.  \n\nOne key leader was Norman Borlaug, the \"Father of the Green Revolution\", who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1536104094,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

For me, it took over two years to finally understand the concept of ACAB\u2014all cops really ARE bastards, even if they believe themselves to be good people.\n\n&gt; When you learn the history of policing, you will better understand the need to dismantle the inherently racist institution.

All cops are indeed bastards as they blindly enforce laws which were written to oppress poor people, such as laws against feeding the homeless. The primary role of the first police departments was to catch runaway slaves. Racism is ingrained in policing. Racism is the root cause of police brutality.\n\n&gt; There are no good cops.

It is just simply a question of who has the power to legalize violence.\u201d. so here you have it.  i mean the whole talk is [HERE](https:\/\/unableunwilling.wordpress.com\/2016\/06\/03\/the-pitfalls-of-liberalism-by-stokely-carmichael-kwame-ture\/)  if you\u2019re curious.  i think it relates heavily to autonomous self-defense in the age of paramilitary policing under neoliberalism today.","created_utc":1536162162,"score":22,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"humanispherian","body":"*Collectivism* is a term that has historically covered a fair amount of ground, but many of the distinctions that made it important in the past are not important in the same ways now. When, for example, \"mutualism\" referred to a particular faction within the International, the collectivists (Bakunin and those around him) both distinguished themselves from those mutualists on the grounds of differing property theories (as they did, in different ways, from the communists) and presented themselves as a more faithful development of Proudhon's mutualism. But modern mutualism bears only a very limited resemblance to the ideas of the Parisian workers in the 1860s. Later, when there was heated internal conflict between anarchist communists and anarchist collectivists, much of the debate was over the role of organization, with the communists of the period taking a position that was at least partially anti-organization. Because that aspect of anarchist communism did not persist, we now think of the main differences between the two tendencies as having to do with labor notes and the like\u2014which happens to line up with a more general definition of \"collectivism\" in non-anarchist contexts. But it was arguably the introduction of syndicalism into the anarchist movement, the failure of some early insurrections, and the emergence of tendencies like *anarquismo sin adjetivos* and *synthesis* that shifted the debate into other areas. Bakunin was initially somewhat neglected as a theoretical source, as those in possession of his unpublished manuscripts stopped publishing them. By the time his works were more published more broadly, some of his old comrades had changed tendencies (Guillaume, Cafiero, etc.) \n\nAs I read the history, what gradually happened was that the various elements that had made collectivism a distinct movement in the 19th century survived, but not all in one place. Something similar happened with Proudhon's work, although it has taken a long time for all of the constructive elements there to find a place in the modern anarchist movement. \n\nSo maybe collectivism has done its work\u2014or maybe it's awaiting a moment when it will again appear as a useful alternative to all or some of the tendencies (communism, syndicalism, platformism) that have claimed parts of it.

Do you always judge by deed instead of intention? I think going into the millitary is insane and a really stupid and immoral thing to do, but that does not mean I think all people who go into the millitary are bad people. I do believe there are people who have the best intention but are just people who are extremely misinformed and misguided. And you are damn sure if an aquantaince of mine went into the millitary I would try to convince them out of it, but I guess you would shoot onsight instead.\n\n&gt;All cops are indeed bastards as they blindly enforce laws which were written to oppress poor people, such as laws against feeding the homeless.

Cops are also people, literally the only place where this is a problem (feeding homeless people, police brutality) is America by the way.

The former seems more to me like the right wing idea where guns solve everything, we should have cops, soldiers, teachers, students, everyone with guns, train toddlers with guns, sell guns everywhere to everyone. I personally don't want a gun, I don't think everybody has to have a gun, but if they *want to* then sure.\n\nI live in Australia, and it's actually not too bad here. We haven't \"banned guns\" like so many liberal Americans say we have, we just don't have a crazy right-wing gun culture and not anybody can just walk into a Walmart to buy a rifle. AFAIK, the general basis is that you need a license to buy a gun, which isn't hard to get at all. The main thing is that you need to provide a valid reason for it; you can be a farmer or a collector or a hunter or in a recreational gun club... The only really bad thing is that self-defense in and of itself isn't a valid reason, but I mean you can just join a gun club and I think go once a year or something for it to be valid. I know a right wing WASP married guy with children (who supports Trump) in outer Sydney... I mean, sounds like your typical right wing American gun nut kind of guy, he must be sad to live here right? Nope, he owns several guns, including I think a rifle and a shotgun, he goes shooting, he's planning to train his children with them. We could do with loosening the license restrictions a bit more, but it's not a complete gun-less society like a lot of gun control people think we are.\n\nWith many leftists it's also not just about freedom, but necessity... A lot of leftists, especially MLs I think (correct me if I'm wrong), would say \"everyone *should* own a gun\" (not just be able to) because they feel that the proletariat must be armed for the revolution. I don't necessarily agree with that, but if working class people *want* to arm themselves, then they should be able to. Also, I don't think that cops (as long as they still exist) should be armed either, most cops in the UK aren't and they do relatively well, meanwhile most cops in the US are armed and it's a fucking disaster zone.","created_utc":1536224571,"score":11,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Noone can be expected to be able to survive on their own and do everything themselves, or simply not to work. So we split labour and have people specialize in things. A few work in mills, others deal with paperwork, and some deliver pizzas. However, all must work in order to survive, you can't simply take a break from the system, regardless if we grow far more food than we need in most developed states, to the point where the natural unsubsidized price would be basicly nothing. You must work. Regardless of your health, mental state, family, etc or whether or not the costs of your needs are actually nominal without people marking prices up. You have to earn a wage. \n\nThats why most people who subscribe to anarchist ideals feel that the freedom of people to not have to worry about keeping the lights on, or their medical bills outweighs the freedom of business owners to keep their employees in poverty and support both universal healthcare, and living wages or better yet a universal basic income.\n\nNobody is saying that the little old lady down the road needs to pay kid johnny enough to survive to help her shovel her driveway.

They were all saying things like, \"We're not talking about reforming ICE or regulating it or restraining it in some way, we're talking about complete dismantling of the entire institution\". \n\nThat strikes me as very black-and-white thinking, very short-sighted, and very ignorant of some of the work that is done by ICE.

{"author":"Mashaka","body":"The Russia CT, which boils down to  'Trump is in Putin's pocket', requires assuming the veracity of a great many premises, almost none of which has been substantiated with near-certainty. Each of these premises could in fact be true, which is how reasonable people can so readily accept them. The contents of the Steele dossier are a good example of this.\n\nLiberals really want to believe the Russia CT because, firstly, it allows them to cast Trump as the ultimate bad guy. In this situation I like to  point out that Trump is clearly very much a bad guy, even if you give him the benefit of the doubt on literally everything.\n\nSecondly, it allows them to dismiss his policies outright. This is the big one. They assume that 'Any Trump policy is a Putin policy', along with 'Any Putin policy is a bad policy'. This allows you to presume anything Trump does is bad, without having to think or argue. This same reasoning allows them to conclude that 'Any Trump supporter is a Russian shill', which is one easy leap from 'anyone who disagrees with me is a Russian troll.'\n\nBack to the point: when you can show that their theory relies on so many assumptions to play out, in such great defiance against Ockham's Razor, it makes them think. Then you point out that their partisan fervor - which leads them to interpret evidence so that it supports their theory - is the same motivation that lead so many to believe in the anti-Hilary CTs. This sort of fervor is very human, and I'm quick to point that out, so that folks don't think you're calling them stupid or delusional.\n\n\/All my friends are smart liberals.

It's like they've seen so many videos of cops shooting people gratuitously, that they think anyone with the authority of the community entrusted to them should be lit on fire, and those who can't protect themselves or have been victimized will just have to fend for themselves...

{"author":"lunar-future","body":"Ancaps *are* fascists in denial. Full stop.\n\nThey notoriously emphasize the dichotomy between equality of opportunity and equality of outcome preferring the former and outright rebuking the latter, but this dichotomy comes with a glaring flaw that they invariably brush off in a few different misgiving and often revealing ways. The dilemma is this: all humans being equal, and all humans provided equal opportunity, what then explains the disparity in outcome? Their response is usually twofold: their first answer is to explain that the outcomes of those people are directly affected by their choices. They explain that people deserve the freedom to spend their money however they so desire, thus if a person is poor, it is the fault of their own choices. But this explanation only points to even greater flaws. It tacitly implies that there is a perfect way to spend your money in order to maximize your well-being, and if this is true, is it really a freedom to allow people to spend their money however they want to only to punish them for spending it in anything other than a very specific, limited fashion? Moreover, this suggestion that poverty is a consequence of squandering opportunity only reveals the fact that opportunity is directly related to a person's cumulative wealth. What this suggests is that those who have more wealth from the outset have greater opportunity, which immediately disqualifies the second phrase of this dilemma. But the dichotomy *must* be maintained in order to rationalize their ideology, so rather than admitting that there is no equality of opportunity without equality of outcome, they retreat to making apologies for the first phrase of the dilemma; they start to suggest that maybe all humans *aren't* created equal. And this is where they reveal themselves for the fascists that they are.\n\nFascism is the naked application of social Darwinism by the state. Anarcho-capitalism dresses up this same social Darwinism in such a way that it gives people the illusion of having a fighting chance.","created_utc":1536294570,"score":13,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"MrNorc","body":"Because this entire post is a lesson on identity politics. People are so fast to assign blame based on association that they often overlook who that person is or what they have actually done. John Rabe saved over 200k lives, single handedly, at great personal expense and at the risk of death. \n\nMost AltLeftists (Check it out, I just did the same thing) would argue that John Rabe was not a REAL Nazi and was probably just playing the system from the inside. They jump to this conclusion because the idea of confessed Nazi saving lives does not fit their antifascist narrative. However the personal journals of Mr Rabe tell a very different story. Not only was he a Nazi but he was a regional leader of the party and often communicated with superiors in Berlin. One could argue that his interpretation of fascism was a bit different from that of his colleagues however since he often stated that he felt it was his duty as \"A superior Aryan Man\" to defend the helpless and strive to be an example to the rest of humanity. \n\nBut one could not accuse him of being a fascism impostor as he openly praised Hitler and privately pondered party ideology. \n\nThe lesson here is to avoid seeing people as 'Faction members' and begin seeing them as individuals. Believing oneself to be a member of an oppressed minority or believing others to be members of an impressive majority is illusion when we are individuals, surrounded in a sea of other individuals. Political leaders can not exploit this. And thus it is frowned upon. Even the presence of the wikibot is a great indicator of the common disdain for research. Rather than click your link and read up on the subject matter- the common Reddit might prefer to have a bot run and fetch a more condensed\/sanitized version. \n\nSo join me in this little experiment. Lets see how much outrage can be generated by presenting a half-truth and letting the audience create the their own preferred indignation.\n ","created_utc":1536319058,"score":-4,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Sure, they *could* fund a trip to a commune that might be relatively close by, like a state or two away (I'm going to assume you're American), but if the commune you want to go to is in someplace like Paraguay, they might have major reservations. If your parent won't fund it, what makes you think that people will line up to make sure that you can get this done? Unless you know something that I don't, random comrades aren't going to arbitrarily bend over backwards to solve your problems when they have their own to deal with. In regards to a total refusal to use money, what happens if you get injured or your food spoils?\n\nIn addition, there's *so many* things that could go wrong.

So, it\u2019s a technical definition that doesn\u2019t mean the same thing as what you\u2019re describing.\n\nNo that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying, you can reduce biology to chemical terms. That doesn\u2019t mean you can reduce biology to chemical properties. You still have to describe its properties according to biological rules. It\u2019s just a different domain of study. \n\nWhat makes you think we can understand everything? Like any other organism we are defined by our capacities, some of which are applicable to certain inquiries and others which we just can\u2019t do much with. So, like how a rat can\u2019t solve a prime number maze, it\u2019s possible that greater understanding of reality simply requires a conceptual ability that humans just don\u2019t have. There\u2019s no reason to believe otherwise. Unless of course you\u2019re willing to believe we\u2019re supernatural beings. Some problems, specifically problems of mind, haven\u2019t developed much for since their basis hundreds of years ago. Nor can we understand reality. Issac Newton did away with a mechanical conception of reality when he observed that by moving your hand you\u2019re moving the universe. \n\nAsk a biologist and they\u2019ll tell you that understanding quarks is not a prerequisite for describing biological processes.

That we may not be able to actually make this connection is obvious, our mind is finite, finite in time and finite in space. \n\nIn the end it's all the same thing, though. Suppose that we *can* perceive everything; A mind which is infinite in number of neurons and will never die. Then all your biological rules, which are merely aids to your understanding, as they simplify the complex nature of our reality, become one. If everything is connected and that ultimate mind can perceive everything all our rules will become one: That existence itself exists. Or god, or reality, or however you may call it.\n\nYeah, we use biological rules to describe biology. Just as we predict our weather according to some basic principles of meteorology. But the great thing about looking at clouds is that they are so chaotic; Every simplified rule will fail and after a few days, weeks, months your model will become incorrect.

They have turned the poorest quarter of Syria into the most successful despite attacks by the Government, Iraq, Turkey, ISIL, al-Qaeda and many other jihadist groups. \n\nNext time you post, talk about how the Syrian anarchists are doing instead of strawmanning us.","created_utc":1536377277,"score":5,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

How would you address this issue with someone who hasn't had a traumatic experience, say a typical young BLM activist? \n\n&gt; If you come home to a pile of ashes where your house used to be, while everyone else\u2019s is still standing, you would not simply shrug and do nothing because, statistically speaking, it\u2019s not that big of a problem, after all only 1 house was damaged. And you might not take kindly to those who minimize and ignore your suffering, telling you to stop complaining and making it sound like such a big problem. \n\nThat analogy doesn't really work. A house fire isn't as complex and nuanced as the police shootings issue. Obviously, I wouldn't say, \"don't worry about it, you're in the minority\". I would say, \"the lightning did not target your house because it was green,\" if someone said that the color of their house lead to the fire. Again, though, this analogy doesn't work. It's comparing apples and oranges. You can't compare a human-human issue with a human-nature issue. Comparing this issue to the issue of terrorism is much more sound.

{"author":"spuriousegg","body":"But that's the rub I suppose, I see no disconnect, other than the fact that you are making one by choosing to limit your definition of authority. Authority is the power to determine, adjudicate, or otherwise settle issues or disputes - in this sense it is knowledge; the ability to control, command, or determine. I don't understand why you choose to ignore non-coercive non-power relationships  as \"authority\" when you're  having political discussions. The nature of politics is the application of *power*, no matter which ideology you subscribe to:\n\n&gt;In social science and politics, power is the ability to influence or outright control the behaviour of people. The term \"authority\" is often used for power perceived as legitimate by the social structure. Power can be seen as evil or unjust, this sort of primitive exercise of power is historically endemic to humans, however as social beings the same concept is seen as good and as something inherited or given for exercising humanistic objectives that will help, enable and move people. In general, it is derived by the factors of interdependence between two entities and the environment. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe best way to understand the broad social interaction of authority and hierarchy as factors of power is probably through the extensive work of Foucault.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\u201cThere is no power relation without the correlative constitution of a field of knowledge, nor any knowledge that does not presuppose and constitute at the same time power relations\u201d\n\u2015 Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison \n\n\u201cWhere there is power, there is resistance.\u201d \u2015 Michel Foucault, The History of Sexuality, Volume 1: An Introduction \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs Foucault pointed out the notion of the political is the *sum total of the power relations in a society which are equivalent to relations of authority*. \nFoucault considered the view which examines authority as something which simply arises from social and political institutions to be wrong. Authority extends far beyond political institutions. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAlong with other social theorists, Foucault believed that knowledge is *always a form of power*, but he took it a step further and told us that knowledge can be gained from power; producing it, not preventing it. Through observation, new knowledge is produced. In his view, knowledge is forever connected to power and authority, and often wrote them in that way: power\/knowledge.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe existence of the mechanisms of power which we see around us are the result of a series of relations of authority which differentiate things: children from adults, students from teachers or families, subjects or citizens from the administration. or as in the original example, patients from their doctors.  Relationships of authority enter into all mechanisms and institutions, with the result that their existence is not solely restricted to these- even if you do choose not to include them when you are having political discussions. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo in fact *every human interaction that results in a decision being made IS a manifestation of authority* even if you don't find that to be a useful way of thinking about it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAuthority is not a form of merchandise; it is not something which can be acquired and then transferred. According to Foucault, authority is a network of relations which transcends constitutionality and legitimacy, such as economic, class or collective interests. Relations of authority do not exist outside other social relationships, but are instead innate in all of them and define them. Relations of authority are not imposed, either through violence or through ideology. *Authority is innate in all human relationships*. It is not simply the privilege of the ruling class. Authority is not imposed, but exercised.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFoucault is one of the few writers on power who recognised that power is not just a negative, coercive or repressive thing that forces us to do things against our wishes, but can also be a necessary, productive and positive force in society.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo knowledge is authority as it grants the ability to determine or settle an issue. In the case of the doctor there is a two way relationship as you said ' because the doctor is providing their medical training and the patient is providing their knowledge of their symptoms', but it is an unequal relationship. It is the knowledge of the doctor (as he sits at the top of that temporary hierarchical structure) which is needed in order to solve the medical issue. The patient must concede to the authority of the doctor and accept for that brief moment the authority of the doctor as represented by his superior knowledge. This hierarchy exists and this authority exists, albeit temporarily.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n One definition of anarchy is of course the rejection of hierarchy, I believe that to  simply say that all hierarchy is bad and all authority is bad is an overreaction and misconception however. Entrenched hierarchy is bad, as is entrenched authority but both of these concepts can still have useful transient functions. After all how exactly would  computer operating systems work if the concept of hierarchy was rejected?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPerhaps we should move past the doctor-patient hierarchy and perhaps consider an example in education. What role that of a teacher\/supervisor who takes 10 eight year old children and allows them to play\/experiment with building blocks? is this an egalitarian flat structure? Is it free association on an equal level for all concerned? Does not the supervisory role of the adult represent a hierarchy, does not the adult have some degree of temporary non-coercive authority (represented by knowledge and responsibility) over his charges? what of the informal hierarchy that will appear amongst the children? One is quite likely to be more extrovert than the others and  be able to influence behaviour. Is this a bad thing as they find their footing and place within the group? Again not an entrenched hierarchy that will appear but a pecking order- a natural thing to spontaneously occur. Should this be prevented by the adult? If so is this not then coercive authority? \n\n","created_utc":1536448961,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Complete freedom for individual action is not true freedom because it cannot actually exist. Humans simply can't exist apart from society. Therefore one's duties to society at large, that exist as constraints on complete freedom of individual action are not real constraints, they're just necessary facts of human nature. For the same reason that not being able to fly is no limit to the freedom of a fish, refraining from being destructive to society is no limit to human freedom. \n\nBakunin says: \"Man completely realizes his individual freedom as well as his personality only through the individuals who surround him, and thanks only to the labor and the collective power of society. Without society he would surely remain the most stupid and the most miserable among all the other ferocious beasts.... Society, far from decreasing his freedom, on the contrary creates the individual freedom of all human beings. Society is the root, the tree, and liberty is its fruit.....  \n\nTo be free ... means to be acknowledged and treated as such by all his fellowmen. The liberty of every individual is only the reflection of his own humanity, or his human right through the conscience of all free men, his brothers and his equals.\n\nI can feel free only in the presence of and in relationship with other men. In the presence of an inferior species of animal I am neither free nor a man, because this animal is incapable of conceiving and consequently recognizing my humanity. I am not myself free or human until or unless I recognize the freedom and humanity of all my fellowmen. \"\n\nThis is from this essay https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/michail-bakunin-man-society-and-freedom which i think best sums up Bakunin's views on freedom and society.","created_utc":1536502573,"score":11,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Anargnome-Communist","body":"Okay, I briefly skimmed your post history and I honestly don't think you should be debated. Not just because you are a fascist, although that's a major part of it, but also because our worldviews are so fundamentally different that we can't even hold a proper conversation. For the sake of others that might read this, I'm going to briefly go over your post anyway.\n\n&gt; I believe that my country belongs to my countries people and no one else\n\nCountries aren't a real thing. I mean, we, as humans, made them into a thing, like money, gender, chess, etc. but countries, as a construct, don't belong to anybody. \n\nFrom an anarchist perspective, land and its resources don't belong to anybody, except the people actually using it and working with it. Looking at it like that might seem like I agree with you, but from my point of view, that belonging can't transfer based on were your ancestors lived.\n\n&gt; we should be proud of our culture and not allow foreigners to perverse and change it\n\n1. Culture is fluid and ever-changing. At one point, it was a popular pastime in Western Europe to catch a couple of cats, put them in a bag and set the bag on fire. I'm sure glad our culture moved on from that point.\n2. In a vacuum, there's nothing inherently wrong with being proud of your culture, assuming that culture actually has stuff to be proud of. \"Western culture\" is based on the exploitation and domination of others. That's nothing to be proud of.\n3. \"Western culture\" only became what it is today due to foreign influences. That's sorta how culture works, especially if you massively exploit and extract resources from other cultures.\n\n&gt; Islam has no place in western society\n\nI'm not here to defend Islam, but to me, Western society has no place in the world.\n\n&gt; non native ethnicity should go back to their own homeland\n\n1. There's a good chance that homeland isn't worth going back to due to the actions of your beloved Western society.\n2. How would this even work? How far back do you want to go? Even if this idea had any merit (it doesn't), you can't exactly execute policy based on it. \n\n&gt; Im against Globalism, Capitalism, and the exploitation of foreign nationals, their lands and resources.\n\nThat's weird, you just described the basis and history of Western society.\n\n&gt; You should be proud of your history, culture and fight to the death to preserve it.\n\nI've always found it weird to be proud of something you had no hand in at all. But if we ignore that, we should can only take pride in our history and culture if we actually look at it critically. I'm pretty glad someone invented the saxophone and perfected French fries, but I cannot in good conscience think positively about what my country did in Africa.\n\nHistory and culture are mostly tools and looking at them in a different way makes you very dogmatic and uncritical. \n\n&gt; I would love to share my views, have them changed and change \/ understand yours. \n\nYour views aren't worth sharing. They can't be changed through online discussion, because they have no merit and aren't based on the actual world we live in. You are unable to properly understand our views because you cannot conceive of a world in which people willingly distance themselves of power over others.\n\nI'm very serious about this. You didn't state any real views. You stated indefensible axioms you assert are true, and they conveniently confirm the way you look at the world. Maybe you have though about them more (or someone else has, whatever), but you didn't provide us with anything to go on. I'm not actually interested in debating you, but for completeness' sake:\n\n* Why does your country belong to those that currently happen to live in it?\n* Why is pride in your history and culture a good thing? Or even a useful thing?\n* Why do you dislike Islam?\n* Why are you against capitalism and globalism?\n* Why are you a fucking fascist?","created_utc":1536522358,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

FBI records show that COINTELPRO resources targeted groups and individuals that the FBI deemed subversive, including the Communist Party USA, anti-Vietnam War organizers, activists of the civil rights movement or Black Power movement (e.g. Martin Luther King Jr., Nation of Islam, and the Black Panther Party), feminist organizations, independence movements (such as Puerto Rican independence groups like the Young Lords), and a variety of organizations that were part of the broader New Left. The program also targeted white supremacist groups including the Ku Klux Klan and nationalist groups including Irish Republicans and Cuban exiles.\n\n***\n\n**Operation Mockingbird**\n\nOperation Mockingbird was an alleged large-scale program of the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that began in the early 1950s and attempted to manipulate news media for propaganda purposes. It funded student and cultural organizations and magazines as front organizations.According to writer Deborah Davis, Operation Mockingbird recruited leading American journalists into a propaganda network and oversaw the operations of front groups. CIA support of front groups was exposed after a 1967 Ramparts magazine article reported that the National Student Association received funding from the CIA. In the 1970s, Congressional investigations and reports also revealed Agency connections with journalists and civic groups. None of these reports, however, mentions an Operation Mockingbird coordinating or supporting these activities.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1536543427,"score":7,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

So there is never any balance or historical analysis just yahboo from both sides. \n\nFor example most every vanguardist regime set up from an internal struggle (as opposed to imposed from outside in the case of Eastern Europe) took their countries from agrarian economies through to some degree of industrial system. these were brutal nasty regimes don't get me wrong but then when you compare the same process in western European countries we see a similar patern of brutality oppression and at times famines. If we take the UK as an example (I'm from Scotland so I have a bit more knowledge of the history)our industrialisation\/democratisation process goes from the 17th century up until the early 20th and in that time we had numerous periods of instability, state organised\/supported terror and famine (English Civil war and the Cromwell dictatorship, thw Glorious revolutionJacobite uprisings, the Irish potato famine, the Highland clearances as examples).\n\nAnother one to look at is the rise in life expectancy in China. At the end of  WWII it was comparable to some of the pooreest regions of India now it is comparable to that of Western Europe.\n\nI certainly don't sing the praises of any vanguardist regimes but I think there needs to be some nuance in the discussion.

{"author":"svetambara","body":"I think pure anarchism has \"room\" for anarcho-socialist and anarcho-communist societies. We certainly don't want society to be destroyed. We appreciate that human beings have evolved as social creatures. Humans will always want to cooperate, invent, trade and engage in other social activities. But we also don't want it to be a requirement. A portion of human beings will never really have the desire to participate in society for most of their lives. This will not be due to traumas or fears of society but a natural inclination towards solitude. Those individuals will be content living relatively isolated and rarely visiting highly populated areas.\n\nAnd even for those pure anarchists who live in anarcho-communist societies, they may not have the same level of concern about productivity or work. They might just like the company of others but not feel inclined to work or trade in any meaningful capacity. We hope that the surplus \"basic\" goods resulting from automated labor will be relatively free to each and all; things like food, shelter and medicine. I would happily volunteer time to any society that let's me benefit from their production, but I don't think it would need to be every day, or all day. After all, I do not want sports cars, designer clothes and other extraneous things, I just want health and freedom. We see productivity has already met the needs of all, and the profiteering of capitalist ideology is what creates famine and poverty. It is not due to any inherent greed in humanity, or a failure to produce.\n\nThat's the basic premise anyway, and I'm honestly still not well read enough to explain it better than I have. \n\n","created_utc":1536601950,"score":16,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

But since we're on the subject, I might as well elaborate. I fully understand why people would not be on board with believing in gangstalking\/organized harassment, it's pretty hard to believe even as a TI. You think other victims don't know how ridiculous it sounds when they try to tell others about what's happening to them? Hell, I had a hard time believing it was even real myself, and believe me, I at least humored the thought that I could potentially be mentally ill (besides depression, anxiety, and PTSD), but unless you experience something like this, you can't truly know what it is like to try to reach out to people and have them laugh in your face and accuse you of being mentally ill or a conspiracy nut and pretend like they have all the answers themselves. It is kind of concerning that people will be so quick to write it off as \"mental illness\" after reading the comment section on that shitty VICE doc or that stupid \"Internet Insanity\" video saying that it's paranoid schizophrenia without doing any objective research from multiple sources then coming to their own conclusions on the matter. You do realize the amount of people coming out and making videos about this on a daily basis WITH evidence is kind of telling, right?\n\nAlso you may want to look into Sluggish Schizophrenia, which was a bogus diagnosis used by the Soviet Union and the KGB to discredit and silence political dissenters or potential \"threats\" to the government, even in people who showed no symptoms of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, this is the same thing that happened to people in East Germany under the hands of the Stasi (Zersetzung) although what's happening to people nowadays is much more comprehensive and torturous given the leaps in weapons and technology our military has access to, not to mention NSA surveillance. It's pretty simple: the Patriot Act made it possible to flag someone as a terrorist or a threat to national security under false pretences, so any sociopath\/narcissist who you may have pissed off in the past who has connections can very easily make a complaint about you being a potential terroristic threat and before you know it you're put on a terrorist watch list, and that's very commonly where harassment starts for people.\n\nI'm going to copypaste some information as it does a good job explaining what is really happening under our noses:\n\n\"The Stasi was an aggressive police agency that terrorized the East German population until the fall of the Iron Curtain \u2013 and Markus Wolfe, the former head of the Stasi, helped form DHS and assisted in the deployment (within the United States) of covert and overt tactics utilized by the Stasi to oppress the East German citizenry.\n\nThe FBI, DHS, and NSA are now engaged in utilizing unconstitutional Stasi techniques called [***Zersetzung***](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zersetzung), and a huge civilian spy branch has already been deployed in the United States for more than a decade.\n\n\nThe \u201ccivilians\u201d involved in this widespread operation are comprised of immigrants \u2013 both legal and illegal, criminals, ex-cons, and the dregs of US society \u2013 hired by the FBI\u2019s civilian branch called ***InfraGard*** \u2013 which on the street-level, helps manage this unconstitutional and sadistic program, primarily comprised of sociopathic misfits.\n\nYouTube has thousands of videos of people who claim to be victims of \u201c[*Gang Stalking*](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/results?search_query=gang+stalking)\u201d or \u201c[*Gangstalking*](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/results?search_query=Gangstalking).\u201d\n\nIn many cases (not all, but many), these innocent Americans who claim that they are victims of \u201cGang Stalking\u201d are the targets of this illegal counter-intelligence program (***COINTELPRO***) run out of the Department of Justice, and simply do not recognize who or what is behind their harassment and destruction of their lives, relationships and livelihoods.\n\nThe Church Committee exposed this illegal program (which was never terminated) in the 1970\u2019s.\n\n*It is a multi-billion dollar (and illegal) program which funnels funds to InfraGard and private security companies run by ex-FBI, ex-DEA, ex-DoD employees.*\n\nAnyone who has been placed on a watch-list is a potential target for data-theft, cyber-harassment, break-ins (usually no sign of forced entry), vandalism, overt harassment, covert harassment, slander, destruction of personal and professional relationships, economic sabotage of targets, and stalking in commercial locations.\n\nAll of these activities are coordinated from (basically) two playbooks: The Stasi\u2019s \u201c[*Zersetzung*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zersetzung)\u201d tactics and the **Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG**) \u2013 a branch of the UK\u2019s **Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ**).\n\n**JTRIG (and now the FBI, DHS, and NSA) run their operations based on the 5 D\u2019s:** **Deny, Deceive, Disrupt, Degrade, Destroy**.\n\nThese are \u201c*soft-kill*\u201d methods which ruin the lives of innocent American citizens while leaving a \u201cnegligible footprint\u201d \u2013 i.e. little to no evidence of the harassment and unconstitutional activity perpetrated by the rogue factions within the US Government.\"","created_utc":1536608909,"score":-1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Assuming anarchism is JUST a form of communism would be silly, it's a rather broad umbrella that covers a wide range of political ideas, some of which are even mutually exclusive. These kinds of ideologies are never monolithic, to assume otherwise is the same stupid mistake people make when they attack self-described communists as if all communists want to establish totalitarian dictatorships with imperialist aggression. Anarchism has ties to libertarian ideology going way back too, but would you assume that all anarchists have as much in common with libertarians just because of that connection? The key to anarchism comes down to opposition to vertical social hierarchies, but that idea can be represented in leftist ideas about mutual aid and protection of labor or it can be represented as self-determinism and rejection of populist institutions.

{"author":"TofuCasserole","body":"Ah yes *\"finally\"* a critique of Stirner, there's been such a dearth of those. Honestly I don't really feel like putting in a lot of effort into debating critiques of the Byington translation anymore. Did you know it was commissioned by Benjamin Tucker, who insisted on the translation of \"Einzige\" -&gt; \"Ego\"? Yeah definitely not any political intent there. \/s\n\nAnyway here's an ordered list of the main points that everyone seems to get confused by:\n\n* \"Einzige\" literally translates to \"the unique one\". Not \"ego\" or \"self\". The concept discussed in the book is much closer to the concept of the Dao from eastern philosophy than the bourgeois concept of the individual, as many people seem intent on interpreting it.\n\n* The entire first half is just Stirner fucking with his contemporaries in the left hegelians. The point of part one is to argue in favor of \"Egoism\" using the exact same argument that was used to justify the historical progressive narrative that placed communism as the inevitable end of history. As quoted in *The Philosophical Reactionaries*:\n\n  &gt; Do you philosophers actually have an inkling\nthat you have been beaten with your own weapons? Nothing but an inkling. What retort can you hearty fellows make against it, when\nI again dialectically demolish what you have just dialectically put\nup? ... What do you have against it, when I turn your neat trick back on you?\n\n* The racist stuff. Yeah it's in there, but it's basically lifted whole cloth from the arguments of his contemporaries on the left (See point #2). I'm not sure whether Stirner believed that these racial categories had any weight in reality or if he was just using them as a rhetorical gotcha. There's good reason to believe he didn't, considering his rejection of all other categories. But even if it was sincere, you should judge it by the same metric used to judge Marx, Engels, and the like. Or don't, I'm not going to tell you what to do.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel like the critics of Stirner approach his work as if it were aiming to provide answers, or at least some method or framework for considering the world. It provides nothing but a ruthless deconstruction of all such answers and frameworks.\n\nMaybe you think I'm wrong in this interpretation, but I don't care. If there was a coherent philosophy in there, I'm not interested in it. The stuff I did get out of it, the skepticism of grand narratives, of social categories like race, gender, etc. That's what's valuable to me.","created_utc":1536644269,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

We can try to push for genderless expression as hard as we want, but as long as we view transgender lives as less authentic and less valuable than cisgender lives, we will never truly be at that end goal where there is complete freedom from values being placed on gendered expression and appearance - after all, trans people already face so much discrimination based on how they look, as well as what their physiology is like.","created_utc":1536649811,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"PuroKaos","body":"First of all, I don't advocate for living like a caveman. Second, it isn't like we only have a choice between maintaining industrial tech and \"larping as a caveman\". Also, I hold no idealized view of indigenous societies. In fact, I had the chance of personally seeing hunter-gatherer societies and talking to hunter-gatherers about their lives. Far from ideal, but they are much more satisfied with their lives than modern men. Either way, this is irrelevant. We have a lot to learn from them, but I don't hold their societies as an ideal to be emulated, and I believe that anprims who do it are incredibly naive.\n\nTechnology might have spared you and others, but it also kills millions every year (just in 2015, about 12 million died from industrial pollution) and managed to completely fuck our planet a very short period of time. Also, do you realize how many cultures have been destroyed in order to acquire materials for producing technologies in order to produce energy (such as indigenous peoples affected by dams)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd no, you cannot compare industrial technology with an axe. Such comparisons demonstrate that you really have a poor understanding of the critique of it. First of all, you are talking about specific technologies as if they came out of nowhere. You cannot examine the potential of a given technology for harm of benefit without also analyzing its process of production. You also cannot consider individual tools as if they weren't a part of an interconnected system.\n\nTo produce a cellphone for instance you need to open large-scale mining operations in many different places in the world (since you cannot find all the minerals necessary for it in one place). Such mining operations are highly destructive. You also need to transport the materials, produce individuals components of a cellphone and then produce and transport cellphones to consumers\/users. All steps of the process require energy and more materials (as they involve machines which also need to be produced).\n\nAlso, we need to keep opening new mines, since mines end up being depleted.  This is true even if we decide we have enough machines, since we need to repair and replace the existing machines.This means that mining operations need to keep expanding and destroying biomes (as well as the environments that indigenous peoples depend on) for the continuity of technology.  Such things are not true for producing an axe or a stone tool.\n\nAlso, industrial tech has a tendency to slowly expand and take control of all aspects of our lives, which make the individual increasingly subjected to technical needs and to an impersonal network of machines. This is true whether or not technology is managed in a decentralized way, since industrial technology links into systems so massive that individuals have absolutely no control over such systems.\n\nThere are many more issues with technology, but I am not going to get into that. This reply is long enough and I have other things to do. I do have one more thing to say however: you could articulate a proper opposition to the critique of technology and we could have an interesting debate, but you first need to understand it. Simplistic notions such as the idea that everything would be shitty without technology (as if things were always shitty without it) or the extremely naive idea that technology is a neutral tool simply demonstrate a completely lack of understanding of the issue of technology.","created_utc":1536697292,"score":6,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Industrial society in contrast has done more damage in a few hundred years than pre-industrial societies in the 300,000 before that (and that includes other civilizations)\n\nSecond: While non-civilized societies can be harmful to their environments too, they aren't always harmful. a study that looked into the effects of some indigenous populations of British Columbia on their environments for instance concluded that their presence actually enriched biodiversity. Many other peoples have also inhabited a given biome for hundreds\/thousands of years without destroying these biomes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, the notion that we will get out of the mess generated by technology with \"sophisticated technology\" is straight up laughable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;","created_utc":1536707458,"score":4,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Sex_Drugs_and_Cats","body":"I think that in most cases calling his positions \"non-anarchist\" is the same kind of dogmatism as when Leninists\/tankies call positions non-Marxist or anti-dialectical or whatever. I think you can be an anarchist and come to different conclusions\/judgements than other anarchists on an issue and there isn't one \"true anarchist\" position versus all others being non-anarchist. \n\nI mean, for instance, depending on exactly how dogmatic\/puritanical you are, you could deem many actions by the revolutionaries of Rojava or of anarchist Spain as \"non-anarchist,\" because in the reality of an immediate revolutionary situation they couldn't always stick to the absolute dogmatic line of \"pure\" anarchism... For instance, they couldn't just immediately abolish all forms of police in Rojava. Of course you can call operating any form of policing \"non-anarchist,\" but it would be pretty condescending for an armchair philosopher to deride people who are actually participating in a revolution and dealing with the material circumstances on the ground in their autonomous region for not living up to their perfect ideals when those are clearly the ideals they're fighting for. \n\nOf course, it's necessary to point out that there is an extreme version of this point that could be used to justify all kinds of things (like Leninists\/tankies argue that dictatorship, authoritarianism, as state-capitalism is just necessary because of those material conditions), but we should recognize that those are abuses-- exploitations of a legitimate principle. I think it's extremely important to always keep your ideals in mind when determining what tactics\/means are acceptable or necessary, but if we are so dogmatic about clinging to those precise beliefs and rejecting or labeling \"non-anarchist\" anything and everything that isn't absolutely ideal then we will see very little progress, and in fact I do think this has been an issue for anarchists historically, and I do think that the ability of the Spanish, Ukrainian, and Rojavan revolutionaries to adapt to material conditions while staying broadly consistent with anarchist ideals is a large factor in why they were able to be as successful as they were. If in Rojava they had decided that police and military were just \"non-anarchist\" and as such had to be abolished immediately, then they would be adhering perfectly to an abstract ideal, but they would've been destroyed by Islamist terrorism and Turkish reactionary forces in hours. \n\nSimilarly I think that if Chomsky advocates for voting in a particular scenario (for instance), we should not brush it aside as something that makes him \"non-anarchist\" just because it's a different tactical decision than you would make. Personally, I certainly disagree with the idea of voting for Hillary Clinton under any circumstance (I voted for Sanders in the primary and Stein in the general, and I completely understand why many anarchists refused to vote at all), but, even though I think he was wrong, I don't think that this is a symptom of him having forsaken anarchist ideals and becoming a liberal. \n\nIf you take context and reasoning into account, I think it's clear that this was just an ethical tactical assessment about preventing what he deemed the worst possible disaster scenario. I disagree about his calculus (I place Trump and Clinton on pretty even ground), but I don't think that him having a different opinion makes him \"non-anarchist.\" On almost any tactical issue anarchists will inevitably be divided, and we can treat this divide as a difference between \"real\" anarchists and \"non-anarchists,\" and endure sectarian division ad infinitum as the left has so frequently in the past, or we can look at them (I think accurately) as tactical disputes among people who do hold anarchist ideals. The latter is a much healthier state of affairs in my opinion.\n\nI totally agree with many of our peers that Chomsky has lost his fire a bit-- his lectures, interviews, and other media from the 1970s-1990s is some of the most inspiring work I've ever come across, but in his old age he has mellowed somewhat. However, when people say he has become a liberal or something I think that is very narrow-minded and quite pretentious to speak down about someone who has done as much more to advocate for anarchism and to challenge its adversaries than any one of us have. You may find some of his tactics too moderate, but he is still animated by the desire to abolish capitalism, the state, patriarchy, white supremacy, imperialism, and all other unjust hierarchies... The man spent so much of his career being the ONE high-profile individual who actually pointed out that liberalism is relatively right-wing and that it's role in our society is to put bounds on what can be considered as an acceptable \"left-wing\" position... So when I see people say he himself is a liberal, or a \"gate-keeper,\" or any other such nonsense, I think that's quite insulting.

I mean, Chomsky is one of my greatest heroes so this comes from a place of love for him, but he is so adamant about the scientific worldview, about using reason and empirical evidence to draw conclusions. And in the case of all kinds of atrocious CIA operations and American war crimes and so on, he does splendidly. \n\nBut on the subject of 9\/11 it's as if he was completely incapable of taking an objective look at the evidence. I completely understand why he (and many others) found themselves in that position, but the aggression with which he mocked and dismissed people who did research into the subject as \"conspiracy theorists\" was very hypocritical and I thought a very uncharacteristic lapse of judgement. I mean he is exactly the kind of person who the corporate media would call a \"conspiracy theorist\" for actually looking into internal government documents, citing the words of public planners and groups like the Trilateral Commission, bringing attention to covert activities that the deep state carries out around the world... And yet he sees 9\/11 so differently, as if it doesn't fit into the contextualization of everything he knows about the intelligence-military-industrial apparatus. \n\nI am also a lover of science, reason... Someone who only forms firm beliefs on the basis of substantive evidence... But having looked into 9\/11 deeply a few years ago, I feel like if you do take an unbiased look at the evidence (rather than just accepting anything the 9\/11 Commission Report and NIST Report say at face value), there are many convergent streams of evidence which all point in the same direction, and that is that it was indeed an inside job. The corroborating circumstantial\/video\/eyewitness evidence and the documentation of motive of those who were probably behind it is mountainous, but it was the hard material evidence that really convinced me. The peer-reviewed paper that documented the discovery of a HUGE amount of nanothermitic material in the dust from the buildings was incredibly sound science. They published virtually everything-- their electron microscopy images, their XEDS spectral analyses, the videos and graphs of their calorimeter tests, the chain of custody and origins of the various dust samples (which were all collected by different unrelated individuals at different times throughout the destruction)... I mean, they went all out. If you have a pretty basic understanding of chemistry then it is not difficult to understand their findings. And since then, the same experiments have been replicated by other teams and the results have been the same-- the nanothermite is real and was plentiful in the WTC buildings (which explains the otherwise inexplicable nature of the collapses)... \n\nThe paper doesn't make any crazy claims about who did it or why or how. It's very sound-- they analyzed the material and concluded it was indeed nanothermite, and we can do with that what we will... But there are only so many explanations for who could have pulled off that kind of attack and how, and al Qaeda certainly couldn't have. And now we know for certain that our ally, Saudi Arabia, financed the hijackings, and yet we're still unshaken allies with them... So doesn't that suggest that there was some understanding? Anyway.

In *Necessary Illusions*, he writes that:\n&gt; It is a natural expectation, on uncontroversial assumptions, that the major media and other ideological institutions will generally reflect the perspectives and interests of established power. That this expectation is fulfilled has been argued by a number of analysis. Edward Herman and I have published extensive documentation, separately and jointly, to support a conception of how the media function that differs sharply from the standard version. According to this \"propaganda model\"\u2014which has prior plausibility for such reasons as those just briefly reviewed\u2014the media serve the interests of state and corporate power, which are closely interlinked, framing their reporting and analysis in a manner supportive of established privilege and limiting debate and discussions accordingly. \n\nFor example, reporting on atrocities committed by states whom the U.S. opposes happens without debate or demands for evidence. Claims about U.S. atrocities are subjected to insistent demands for evidence and \"proof\" and then declared to be false or crazy when those demands can't be met. It's not that far from Orwell's conception of Newspeak: events can't happen and ideas can't be thought when the language necessary to describe them is declared to be outside the norm and therefor nonsense. \n\nYou can find excerpts from *Necessary Illusions* that give examples of this at http:\/\/davidpritchard.org\/sustrans\/Cho89\/.","created_utc":1536750832,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

They'd rather have 2 mega chains to compete with than 15 tiny shops opened up by poor, unemployed individuals trying to do something.","created_utc":1536760794,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"CosmicRaccoonCometh","body":"This is the book that made me think there was a place within anarchism for me. \n\nBefore this, I was interested in anarchism since the critiques and ideas within it were overlapping with a lot of my own thoughts; but the moralism motivating much of it, and the group-think that seems to adhere to that moralizing, it made me think that anarchism, though an interesting source for potential allies, was not really for me. \n\nReading Novatore (this book in particular) changed my mind on that though. If someone such as him could find a place among anarchists, if a plant like that could take root and grow, then perhaps there was room for me as well. Perhaps the soil was richer than I at first thought. \n\nAnd it is. And I'm very glad Novatore was recommended to me. It opened an entirely new world of thought, actions and influences to me. Anarchism as done by people like Novatore has become the biggest influence and inspiration I've encountered in my life. \n\nMore and more lately I've come to think that perhaps calling people like Novatore \"anarchists\" is a mistake. That the word \"anarchist\" being so broad that it includes such wild ones, as well as those whose desires and motivations are incompatible, that using the terms in this way obfuscates more than it elucidates -- and that would make it a bad use of language in my opinion. Not to mention that in doing so we might be making our own desires incomprehensible to others, and, what's worse, incomprehensible even to ourselves. \n\nStill, terminology aside, my love for this book will always be about more than sheer appreciation -- it will always include ample gratitude for convincing me to dive into the anarchist tradition and anarchist communities, something which has had a positive and challenging transformational impact on my thought and my life.

{"author":"CosmicRaccoonCometh","body":"Yes, I think *perhaps* a rupture with anarchism is a good idea. Not in a hostile way mind you -- indeed, I think such a rupture might actually facilitate more genial cooperation. \n\nIt is like this: think about being in a relationship with someone you love and respect, but you each want very different things. They want a monogamous long term partnership, and you want something more fluid and open -- but each time either of you try to talk about the differences or to even think about it, the idea of the \"relationship\" per se, a term you both use but are internally using differently, it gets in the way -- it even gets in the way of your own thoughts about what you really want. And, as a result, each of you feels dissatisfied, starts to resent the other, and starts trying to control the other by finding methods by which to force them to see the \"relationship\" the way you do, and then to use that concept of \"relationship\" as a cudgel to get them to act the way you want. \n\nBut, if the idea of the \"relationship\" is dropped, if both people can openly express what they want without having to worry if it fits within that \"relationship\", then both are liberated to pursue what they really want. And they then go from being combatants wedded together by a term each was using differently, and they can go back to loving and respecting each other as individuals -- and going forward their future interactions can be based on an open and honest understanding of what each wants, especially in the areas in which they are actually in accord. \n\nI feel like it is the same for us \"anarchists\". I feel like we (both social anarchists and the wild ones) often come to fight over what \"anarchism\" is, so as to use that concept as a cudgel to influence the actions of others -- i.e., by defining anarchism a certain way each can get those who desire different particulars from them to act against those desires in order to align themselves to the concept of \"anarchism\" so defined. A subconscious awareness of this as an ongoing process that one is exposed to likely causes a lot of the visceral animosity and vitriol one comes across in anarchist communities. \n\nI further think that the term anarchism is thoroughly and unavoidably going to retain association to the political movements, groups and actions of the past that existed in the name of anarchism over the last century or so, and that it is therefore a term not suited for the purposes of those currently thinking and living along the lines of people like Novatore. So, I say we make a gift of it to those of our friends for whose purposes it is still apt. A parting gift of sorts. \n\nSorry for the ramble -- this topic has just been on my mind a good bit recently, so I'm using the opportunity to play around with my thoughts a little bit.

{"author":"truthsinnumbers","body":"# Backstory:\n\nIn discussion with friends, this has come to the surface time and time again. So many people are quick to reference Marx and speak of the \"evils\" of the market or capitalism with very little understanding of the larger backstories to all these different ideologies and their implications... More people need to be educating themselves more before assuming they know how to solve all the world problems...\n\nI'm not \"anti-Marx\" per say... I AM anti-Marxist tho. A blind (or even loyal) commitment to any particular ideology is essentially a form of \"totalism\" as I call it... and can quickly descend into totalitarianism. I think Marx's critique of issues (or evils) with the market (or capitalism) were appropriate... his description was valid, accurate (particularly in light of working conditions of the time). BUT, his prescription and the manifestation of his \"answer\" (as the 20th century clearly showed) was more horrifying than anything the market (or capitalism) could drum up... 100's of millions dead under the sword of democide (government genocide)... Mass depopulation in the name of the \"collective\" and the supposedly \"capitalist\" elite obviously love that shit. Not to evidence that Marx (like so many ideologies) was actually supported and popularized via the \"globalists\" of the time (also, see Antony Sutton's work).\n\n# It is crucial in this time that we all continue to inform ourselves, together... it is the ONLY way to retain liberty for ourselves and our posterity.\n\n\"Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on **retentiveness**. When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: **and when experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.**\"\n\n\\- George Santayana\n\nEducate and inform the whole mass of the people... **They are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty**.\"\n\n\\- Thomas Jefferson","created_utc":1536782737,"score":-3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"WikiTextBot","body":"**Haymarket affair**\n\nThe Haymarket affair (also known as the Haymarket massacre or Haymarket riot) was the aftermath of a bombing that took place at a labor demonstration on Tuesday, May 4, 1886, at Haymarket Square in Chicago. It began as a peaceful rally in support of workers striking for an eight-hour day and in reaction to the killing of several workers the previous day by the police. An unknown person threw a dynamite bomb at police as they acted to disperse the public meeting. The bomb blast and ensuing gunfire resulted in the deaths of seven police officers and at least four civilians; dozens of others were wounded.\n\n***\n\n**Industrial Workers of the World**\n\nThe Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), members of which are commonly termed \"Wobblies\", is an international labor union that was founded in 1905 in Chicago, Illinois in the United States of America. The union combines general unionism with industrial unionism, as it is a general union whose members are further organized within the industry of their employment. The philosophy and tactics of the IWW are described as \"revolutionary industrial unionism\", with ties to both socialist and anarchist labor movements.\n\nIn the 1910s and early 1920s, the IWW achieved many of their short-term goals, particularly in the American West, and cut across traditional guild and union lines to organize workers in a variety of trades and industries.\n\n***\n\n**Battle of Blair Mountain**\n\nThe Battle of Blair Mountain was the largest labor uprising in United States history and one of the largest, best-organized, and most well-armed uprisings since the American Civil War.The conflict occurred in Logan County, West Virginia, as part of the Coal Wars, a series of early-20th-century labor disputes in Appalachia. Tensions rose between workers and mine management, and for five days from late August to early September 1921, some 10,000 armed coal miners confronted 3,000 lawmen and strikebreakers, called the Logan Defenders, who were backed by coal mine operators during the miners' attempt to unionize the southwestern West Virginia coalfields. The battle ended after approximately one million rounds were fired and the United States Army intervened by presidential order. Up to 100 people were killed, and many more arrested.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1536809600,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"WikiTextBot","body":"**Toba catastrophe theory**\n\nThe Toba supereruption was a supervolcanic eruption that occurred about 75,000 years ago at the site of present-day Lake Toba in Sumatra, Indonesia. It is one of the Earth's largest known eruptions. The Toba catastrophe theory holds that this event caused a global volcanic winter of six to ten years and possibly a 1,000-year-long cooling episode.\n\nIn 1993, science journalist Ann Gibbons posited that a population bottleneck occurred in human evolution about 70,000 years ago, and she suggested that this was caused by the eruption.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1536834092,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Very few -- even two decades later, when it might have helped them legally -- claimed to have had ethical qualms. A few observed that they felt they were freer than others to withdraw from the killing process because they had no intention of remaining policemen after the war; their colleagues, though, had to think about their careers. For many, the pressure to conform to the group, and to not seem like cowards, played a role in their continuing to shoot. One metalworker from Bremerhaven contented himself with the rationale that he would shoot only children, since if his partner shot the mother then the child would be unable to survive alone and killing it would be an act of mercy. For nearly all, the Jews were not in the same human family as they. Their commander, Major Trapp, had told them, in his initial speech, that all Jews were enemies who deserved to be killed, even their women and their children, because Germany's enemies were killing German women and children with bombs.","created_utc":1536859465,"score":5,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"MisOes","body":"That, I think, is exactly it for me... if our ideology is so universal, why so white? I think that for a lot of white anarchists it's the anti-authoritarianism aspect of anarchism that's so compelling - opposing the \"authority\" of capitalism, the \"authority\" of patriarchy, of white supremacism, toxic masculinity, militarism, etcetera - and we tend to see all these evils as flowing from this \"authority\". That makes sense - white people, of course, are born into the heart of the machine they are supposed to serve (of course, this hasn't been limited to white people for a while now - buuut it's still pretty white). But for people caught in an anti-colonialist struggle - like Palestinians resisting Israeli encroachment, for instance - pure anti-authoritarianism doesn't help much, because the machine isn't interested in bending them to it's will with it's \"authority\"- it's purely interested in making them blink out of existence. I'm beginning to understand why an organisation such as  Abahlali baseMjondolo aren't really that focused on anti-authoritarianism in a way that an anarchist would understand - it wouldn't help them at all. It's an important clue, I think - as long as we're simply going to be about opposing authority, we're not going to have any *direction*.

But one implication (there are a few others, as well) of this is troublesome to me - it means that anarchism was formulated by people who *already had roles in those hierarchies earmarked for them*. In settler societies, of course, that meant white people. Du Bois describes how Irish people were \"incorporated\" into whiteness after the US civil war - the status quo suddenly needed them to be white, and to start playing their part in enforcing whiteness - whiteness was the \"glue\" that keeps that hierarchy in business even in the present day. For anyone who has been \"incorporated\" in such a way *from birth*, resisting the authority of that hierarchy (whether through violence or other means) is the most political act they are really capable of - hence, that which we can arguably point to today and call \"white anarchism\". But for people who *haven't* been incorporated into the hierarchy, it's not about resisting the hierarchy's authority - it's about remaining outside of, or reclaiming that which exists outside the hierarchy (*identity* comes to mind). This, it would seem to me, is the big difference between the *anti-authoritarianism* priority of a white anarchist and the *anti-colonialism* priority of a Native American anarchist... or even a San Maoist (yes, we have San Maoists now!). It essentially means that for any white person that feels compelled to *resist* the hierarchy that owns them, anarchism is really rock bottom - that's about as deep down as they can go.

Many people I've met have never understood the concepts of socialism or anarchism. (Because it isn't taught in schools). These people are lower class black workers who have been ignored by the government. They want major change, but not radical change. They are more open to socialism because socialism still has the concept of a state. (The form of socialism that THEY want has a state). \nWhen they hear of a political system without the government, it is concerning to them. (As it would be, to anyone who has lived under government supervision their whole life). That's a change that is too extreme, and too radical for them to latch onto. Therefore, their form of radicalism is more socialist leaning. I also think the adoption of socialism by various black leaders has led to its popularity among the black community.

Well, no surprise, the soldiers' pace fell and they ended up packing just as many chutes as before, only now they had lost their free time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSomething similar happened in a cable installer business (Comcast, iirc). They originally had a qualified, senior staff whom they paid per job. The staff was trained and had the motivation to get jobs done quickly and right the first time. Some higher up realized that they were also paying these employees a lot of money (which could be better used for executive bonuses). So he (probably he) decided to switch to paying a lower per hour rate. Most of the senior staff quit, so the company had to hire inexperienced employees. Overall less work was done because the new staff wasn't as knowledgeable and didn't have a financial motivation to work quickly, and customer satisfaction suffered as a result...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...but the company saved a lot of money, and that's what counts!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI also remember going into a FedEx to make some copies.

Anarchism occupies the bottom left hand corner of that cluster of ideologies. The reason, I think is that, Anarchists oppose the state and unjust hierarchy. The reason that Anarchists are inherently leftists is that capitalism is inherently a hierarchical ideology, there always has to be the boss and the laborer, the rich and the poor, and bourgeoise and the proletariat. Also capitalism creates a sort of faux state through private ownership of capital, as in the people that own capital would form a loose idea of a state.

The continuation of industry does not however, have to be in conflict with the environment. If industry is to continue into the future, I would want it to make drastic changes as to where it sources its energy and material needs. If industry wants to coexist with the environment, its biggest priority must be sustainability. Most of its manufactured goods should be recycled, and closed loops of material should be made wherever and whenever possible. Of course sustainability in this way is more difficult, if it were the most convienent way of producing things the capitalists would be doing it today. They dont because they would have to build more equipment and employ more people for no extra profit. If your only goal is profit, what is the difference between a recycling center and a landfill? Being sustainable without reducing everyone's standard of living requires more work. This work can either be done by more humans working longer hours, or it can be done by automation.

Most of the ordinary Fascists and Nazis back in the 1920s\/30s were regular people, and, in their minds, those movements were totally benign. It's an extremely rare sort of anti-social personality who actually embraces the idea of being the villain. For all the millions of others who participate in fascism and reaction, these things always appear innocent enough. In their minds, they are justified. They are doing something harmless or even positive.\n\nEven if we could peer into the hearts of these people and really discover this motivation of just wanting to \"own the libs\" without any conscious grasp of how that sentiment and behavior intersects with more ideologically motivated fascism, that wouldn't make them any less participants.\n\nAnd just because they don't understand what exactly they are participating in (it's extremely rare that any of us does, tbh) doesn't mean that they are prepared to gain such an understanding. You are welcome to try, but, personally, I wouldn't waste my time or energy on someone who had already gotten as far as acting like an asshole for the sake of it.

{"author":"AddisonakaU0","body":"In principle yes! Totally agree that Anti-imperialism Is NOT a Valid Excuse to Support Assad. However, I think there is still a practical discussion needed on this issue. First, what alternative do Syrian people have for now? And if not, how can there be a long-term alternative plan? And in the meantime, what is a better choice in the given condition in Syria? Supporting Assad or the U.S.? I mean, perhaps it would start to seem controvertial by now, but I can simply offer a near example: Hillary, Trump, or abstain? Yes, if you don't believe in the sate you can abstain, however, what about the real threat of Trump there? This is a practical situation. As an Anarchist I would vote for Hillary as \"the lesser of the two devils\", basically to stop Trump; though it in principle has nothing to do with my Anarchist statements, there are just surgical means needed in the immediate reality. Otherwise, I personally think we are talking about \"Anarcho-escapism\" here. So, to conclude: I think Assad needs a consideration in an extremely immediate term as an option against the U.S., though essentially a farce, a reactionary choice with no long term vision at all; I think it is exactly at this point a separation between the immediate and the long-run is needed, and my short-run forced choice also in the same time indicates the need of a long-run plan of change, otherwise Syria will continue to suffer too much in the future.","created_utc":1537106626,"score":-2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"wy-tu-kay","body":"In response to OP's title I think that a growing number of folks think (or are being sold on the notion) that the planet  will be unsuitable for human life in the not too distant future, that the damage is done and conservation is useless or insignificant, and that the only option is the forward escape: to keep our momentum in the same direction and hustle like hell to overcome the problems of the future through technological advancement. This I think is presented as the only reasonable solution to the problems of the world. Keep the ball rolling. Anything counter to this notion such as environmental conservation or decentralization of power is thought to be an impossible and ultimately useless uphill battle. \n\nI do not think this is anything new. Even though predictions of environmental catastrophe and collapse have only become widespread news in the past 50 odd years the idea that the world as we know it is ending is at least thousands of years old and probably timeless, which makes sense because as individuals each day we draw closer to the end of the world as we know it. But the world keeps turning and we say it moves forward. The world keeps happening and we call that progress. What was 'happening' in the world 50, 100, 200 years ago, etc is what put us in the place we are today. Personally I question the extent to which everything 'just happens.' So many of the planet's problems today were created by the fossil fuels industry and the military industrial complex over the past century. I have no reason to believe the technologies that move us into the future will save us any more than the technologies that delivered us to our present have saved us. \n\nTo summarize I think real change (like the kind talked about on an anarchist sub) is supposed to be impossible and to pursue such change is touted as irresponsible because it ignores the apparent trajectory of our times. The perceived trajectory of our times however is little more than mass propaganda from the powers that be and have been.\n\nIs anyone else feeling this or am I speculating my way around my imaginary world?

{"author":"SolidardadLibertaria","body":"Well, I don't know how much of a help I'll be, but I can tell you that I've struggled with suicide, am an anarchist (obviously) and am a minority (albeit, I come from a Mexican background). So maybe you'll find something of worth in something I can share.\n\nI can say that things might never be as we'd want them, as an ideal. And sometimes, what we think we'll like turns out to be something quite different than imagined. For example, I love doing music, writing, and art, used to think that I would do it for a living. However, once I got into university, I opted for a major in the medical field, of which I now work in. Turns out, despite me thinking that I was going to hate it, I think it brought more fulfillment that music ever could, as I can help people directly, and helped me grow as a person. I don't see myself doing it forever, but it provides some form of stability, enough for me to figure out the next few steps. I also found that the music scene changed, so I was kinda glad I got out; I still do it on my off time, which helps me enjoy it rather than stressing it as a job.\n\n Now, art is a different animal, and your dream of finding work in the political, human, or social sciences is of more utility and easier to find a job than art. I'd say, if you do your research, you can find a good job in that field. Either that, or you can use the financial stability of your current degree to fund a degree in the social sciences later on. That's what I plan on doing, using my medical job to fund a path to hopefully work in non-profits someday. It also funds my travel when I feel like taking a break, which was a newfound passion that I had never thought about!\n\nAs for the not fitting in, that is, not having a community, I know that I and probably plenty of us on this subreddit feel the same way. I live in a conservative area, so feeling alienated is definitely something I can feel ya on! Kinda hope I can find a place I can feel at least a little more at home in, I think that is one reason I like to travel, but there's really no heaven on earth. Even in places like Exarchia, they have their issues, such as drug dealers bringing in violence, not to mention their long fight against the police state and fascist attacks on squats. However, there's definitely places you can fit in more than others, and I'd encourage you to find that place, especially after ya figure out your career path.\n\nTo sum this up: sure, you should set goals, but don't be afraid to change them as you go through life. Plenty people do, and they are happy because of it. A lot of people don't even work in their Major's field. Take the time to discover what makes you happy! Mine was helping others, travel, and going to the outdoors. Get involved in volunteering or activism, as it sure gives your life meaning beyond yourself. Embrace being alone, which was something that used to terrify me, but has now become an environment I thrive in.\n\nHope you the best, and pm or update us!","created_utc":1537142283,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

They probably see society and it's problems as unsolvable because of how cultures tend to coalesce around ideology instead of being flexible and changeable. When a person has a political conversation, so much of it is irrational emotion, that one begins to question the efficacy of rational discourse. The natural conclusion might be: violence. After all, the bottom line is we either talk things out, or we get violent. Third options are hard to come by.\n\nAlso, there is a tendency for advocates of violence to be young and at the bottom of the economic spectrum. They may see themselves as unbiased in this regard (nothing to lose, therefore nothing holding them back from seeing the truth), but they overlook that same fact when it comes to who will do the fighting and who will run the new government. They have no experience in either of these things, and the result would be disastrous. \n\nLastly, they don't know what they're up against. The machine they want to smash is so much larger and more capable of violence than ever before. 100 years ago, maybe. Now? Not even likely.

{"author":"vetch-a-sketch","body":"&gt; I'm saying that, no matter the type of a society, there are universal (but extremely obvious) set of functions within every society, small or large, that allow humans to exist. Oppressive or not, the above is true.\n\nI get that. But that only makes society good if *existence* is good, and whether existence is good very much depends on the particular society and the particular individual.\n\n&gt; People universally value their quality of life. Their quality of life is contingent on their environment. Their environment is being negatively effected by the economy. Therefore, people should want to regulate the economy so as it doesn't negatively impact the environment and therefore their quality of life. \n\nThis should worry you, because greening our society into a sustainable one will also entail a loss of quality of life -- at least, as far as it is understood by the people who've adopted that society's values.\n\n&gt; Further, could one justify prioritizing other problems than one that is existential, if those other problems aren't also an existential threat? Not logically, based on the above.\n\nRight. But individuals die. If one doesn't identify oneself with one's children or with the greater society, then one would not be invested in their preservation after death. Instead, the first existential problem to triage for such a person becomes \"how not to die?\". And if that is impossible, then such a person is liable to prefer his own continued comfort to his posterity.\n\nYou haven't established a reason why one would always and without fail 'rationally' identify with one's society (or one's children). Rather you offered that society should be protected because it enables life, apparently backed by an unspoken premise that life is good. It would seem to me that these are purely emotional decisions based on your own life being enjoyable to you, dressed up as 'rational'.\n\n&gt; What would losing all hope give you? It's self destructive.\n\nBut destruction of pain is good. You've already recognized that. What you fail to acknowledge is that terminal illness is not the only way for life to be painful enough to be unwanted.\n\n&gt;Considering that human beings cannot know the future for certain, despair is the opposite; it is illogical.\n\nIf the future is unknowable then both despair and hope are emotional responses.","created_utc":1537165944,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I currently do caregiving.

Unsure if this will lead to consequences most severe as an elder, leaving me potentially unable to have my decrepit and aged flesh cared for into my golden years to ensure a peaceful end?

{"author":"Parasitian","body":"I'd like to respond to some of these statements \n\n&gt;The concept of whiteness is something we should be working to eradicate, not uphold\n\nI absolutely agree and one of the more prominent members is frequently saying this and also has written on this exact topic. The majority of the organization seems to understand this. Keep in mind that our conception of \"redneck\" is itself a multi-racial identity as it is derived from the solidarity of many miners from different races during the Battle for Blair Mountain where strikers fought their bosses wearing red bandanas around their neck (that's why that is part of our garb).\nI do think some members have some issues (and we have some branding problems) but we are constantly moving further and further away from reifying whiteness.\n\n&gt;Their lack of a solid anti-patriarchal stance is really fucking weird considering what they do.\n\nIn our principles (which can be found on our website) it explicitly says that \"we stand against patriarchy\". Also this rhetoric bothers me a bit considering most of our prominent members are non-men and many of our founding members were women and queer folk. We definitely do have a masculinity problem (like much of the left) but I don't think it's as bad as people make it out to be.\n\n&gt;Dave Strano\n\nThis whole situation is a lot more complicated than people make it out to be but regardless he is no longer in the network.\n\n&gt;the network is not as autonomous as it claims to be\n\nTbh I strongly disagree with this, the only real hierarchy that exists is in the form of social capital (the people who are popular) but they are well-liked precisely because they do so much work for the organization which can easily be solved by having more people step to the plate. Like many orgs a lot of the work is done by a minority of people and I do hate how those people (informally) get a bigger say but I don't know how to solve that problem. Outside of that though our organizing is EXTREMELY horizontal and autonomous, in fact a lot of members think we are too autonomous. You mention ex-members but a lot of members have left because the organization wasn't able to solve problems because there was no formal authority to implement necessary changes (for example the network is unable to purge problematic members, individual chapters have to vote them out). I personally like it being this autonomous because the national organization isn't able to fuck with individual chapters but it does come with its downsides.\n\n&gt;Acting as security at events where they were not asked to be security\n\nThis is a very valid point and something we have had a problem with. We have mostly stopped doing this to my knowledge and most members have been very critical of some chapters for doing such a foolish thing.\n\nThat being said sometimes shitty situations have arose that were genuinely not our fault. We were asked to do security at one event in Colorado but the people leading this event did not tell the people who were invited that they had asked us to do this so they were surprised to see a bunch of armed people and understandably got scared. Similar things have happened on multiple occasions.\n\nAt an anarchist bookfair in California the organizers did things that alienated a lot of the (primarily PoC) population nearby and then blamed it on RR security even though we didn't cause the problems and had no intention of being there until we were asked to be there.\n\nWE DO have quite a few problems but I firmly believe that we are one of the better leftist organizations currently. We get far more criticism from other leftists than we do from the communities we work in.","created_utc":1537216407,"score":7,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"dishspongesghost","body":"I support armed resistance, but the problem with Red Neck Revolt is they approach it backwards. To be more specific, they have basically defined their organization around a \\*tactic\\* (armed self-defense) rather than organizing around a  \\*strategy\\* (popular power). They have misunderstood how armed self defense relates to revolution, and the fetishization of tactics before strategy implies the group thinks tactics usher in strategy in some way.\n\nGood praxis never puts tactics before strategy. Rather, tactics grow out of, serve, and are subordinate to a larger revolutionary strategy.   While RR pays lipservice to organizing popular power, the group in reality has a foundation based on tactics. I'd oppose this tactical foundation to something like the old syndicalist movement.  It had a strategy to overthrow the class system, and at times it found a need to use the tactic of armed self defense to protect itself from reaction. Armed self defense was tactic subordinate to the larger power of an organized class. Basically, instead of organizing around tactics like RR, organizations should be based on strategy like unionism, tenant organization, etc. I've heard an author call this RR type organizing a \"floating tactic\", meaning it's not grounded in strategy. sorry can't remember the source on that.\n\nAlso, I know RR does other work besides gun club stuff, but it is still branded and presents itself as the pro-gun thing. Another comparison I'd make is with the Black Panthers. The Black Panthers didn't form as a pro-gun group to do fire arm training 'and more'. It formed to build community power, black liberation, and an end to the class system. Use of armed self defense tactic by the BP grew out of this larger organizing work and didn't take center stage as it does in RR.\n\nThere is also a lot of lineage from right wing gun culture in red neck revolt, especially the idea that \"if more people would just learn how to handle guns\" type of ideology.  While the group has the necessary idea of mass orientation in their minds (\"meeting people where they're at\"), and they set themselves up to recruit from american culture, the american fetish with guns shouldn't be the main organizing basis of any revolutionary group. That shouldn't be the main appeal. RR is basically a grouping of people who are in a process of deterritorializing from american capitalism\/white supremacy, but then get reterritorialized on the point of gun fetishism. This may succeed in recruitment but the premise also functions as a limit to revolutionary organizing. Such style of recruitment means its organizers have a tendency to repeat american culture rather than to destroy it. So, it's no wonder why the whole gun thing is front and center to begin with. In a way, American culture has met anarchists where they're at when it comes to RR.  Reminds me of how DSA thinks it's going to radicalize democrats, but then DSA just turns out to be socialists getting deradicalized. There isn't even that many americans that think armed self defense is important. So RR isn't very mass oriented when that's what they're chasing. It'd be better to organize around common issues such as landlord problems or workplace problems. \n\nThe better way to do armed self defense is as an appendage of a revolutionary class organization and to be somewhat mandated by the needs of the larger class struggle context. Not abstract theory that the state will repress us, but actual repression of a movement by reactionary forces.   summing up, RR puts the cart before the horse. Or more accurately, they don't have a horse and it's just the cart floating, prepared to defend but disjunct from any popular organization; ready, but irrelevant.

But not everybody is in a position to live as a gender rebel fulltime, nor does not living as a gender rebel imply that one does not care about abolishing gender roles and sexism, or work towards that goal in their own ways.\n\nFor my safety and for my sanity, I need to move out. But in order to move out, especially in the part of the world I live in (and not by my choice), I need a stable income that also allows me freedom to grow as a person and breath somewhat. But in order to even have the chance at gaining a stable income, I have to deal with employers' preconceptions about who I am, preconceptions which they may consciously or unconsciously make a decision not to hire me for, and they can merely boil it down to 'cultural fit' or another candidate being 'more suitable'. It's been confirmed that it is generally the case in the field I have spent over 6 years studying and skilling up for, and now I have to start from scratch elsewhere again. The Law won't protect me there. And that's why passing is important to me and so many other trans people - not only because my *personal* experience of my gender is mostly in line with the established binary, but also because I do not have the freedom to actively rebel against the system if I am to survive. You don't blame the decisions individuals have to make in order to survive Capitalism on the individuals, the fault is with the system that gives them no choice. Likewise, you don't blame trans people for doing what they need to in order to survive not only Capitalism but to stay safe if they don't already have the means to and to ultimately survive their dysphoria, which even for people who have transitioned for many years, lurks in the background like a shadow and catches you in your moments of weakness.\n\nHere's a good [TEDx talk](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0D9QIG36J9Q) which mentions a lot of the reasons why we (and by 'we' I speak only as a trans woman) do what we do, and even when we do them we still have the chance of having bad things happen to us because of who we are.\n\nAbolishing gender norms and roles is an admirable goal, but it shouldn't come at the cost of marginalised people who experience their gender in a particular way. Aim to abolish norms and roles, not expression. The goal should also be to make all forms of gender expression valid, not to restrict it yet again, but toward a different end.","created_utc":1537278672,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"M4D_SCIEN7IST","body":"Nah man, I'm really not trying to troll and i don't have an ulterior motive. I see that we just have different views on what it means to be anarchist. To me, there will always be terrible people in the world, I guess I'm kind of a cynic like that. Business leaders like McDonald's executives, who don't give a shit, will always exist in our world because it's human nature. And I agree that greed and hunger for power and wealth oftentimes results in the situation we see here, as you pointed out: uncompensated, unfair slave labor that has become ingrained in an evil corporation. I agree with you on that point.\n\nBut I don't think that capitalism as an idea is the cause of this. It's the evil people who did this and the lack of retribution from the public. Capitalism can definitely be a framework that supports evil people, but it can also be the framework for their downfall and the way that people fight back for themselves. When people are given the ability to freely govern themselves, they are able to speak out (like these employees are doing), and allow for other good people to start business practices in competition with the bad ones and hopefully put the bad ones out of business for good.\n\nBut out current society (in the USA) isnt free enough and corporations like McDonalds have massive support and funding from governmental agencies which they have bought, cheated, and lied to obtain. In a true free, anarchist society, Mcdonalds would not have this artificial governmental backing, and they would eventually crumble as their employees leave for better working opportunities, as their backwards business practices are exposed via free speech and media, and their profits and power will diminish and go away. This process of fighting back is the same process McDonalds originally used to gain its success, and I argue it's similar to capitalistic ideas.\n\nSo i don't think capitalism is to blame. It government, its evil people, and it's a system that doesn't encourage freedom the way it should.\n\nBtw, I don't consider myself an an-cap or an-con or libertarian or whatever, political titles are bullshit anyway.

Cooperatives have many businesses advantages including more productivity, lower turnover, higher wages. Finally workers will get a fair say and be treated well, unconditionally.\n- Credit Unions: instead of money being collected in banks, take it to these, where rates are better, there\u2019s less predatory behavior and all members are also owners.\n- micro grid: small neighborhood power plants that provide energy without the state or corporations.\n- Communal defense: instead of police train all citizens in self defense, create a voluntary police that is held accountable by the commune. Any officer who abuses their position is voted out by the people they were supposed to protect.\n- The DIY movement: don\u2019t like something? Get a group together and fix it yourselves. Don\u2019t wait for the state or capitalists, they won\u2019t come.\n\nNot a complete list obviously, just a few small things that people can work on basically anywhere.

{"author":"LukeTheFisher","body":"Guess I got lucky:\n\n\nShe was 14 when she joined the Dutch resistance, though with her long, dark hair in braids she looked at least two years younger.\n\n\nWhen she rode her bicycle down the streets of Haarlem in North Holland, firearms hidden in a basket, Nazi officials rarely stopped to question her. When she walked through the woods, serving as a lookout or seductively leading her SS target to a secluded place, there was little indication that she carried a handgun and was preparing an execution.\n\n\nThe Dutch resistance was widely believed to be a man\u2019s effort in a man\u2019s war. If women were involved, the thinking went, they were likely doing little more than handing out anti-German pamphlets or newspapers.\n\n\nYet Freddie Oversteegen and her sister Truus, two years her senior, were rare exceptions \u2014 a pair of teenage women who took up arms against Nazi occupiers and Dutch \u201ctraitors\u201d on the outskirts of Amsterdam. With Hannie Schaft, a onetime law student with fiery red hair, they sabotaged bridges and rail lines with dynamite, shot Nazis while riding their bikes, and donned disguises to smuggle Jewish children across the country and sometimes out of concentration camps.\n\n\nIn perhaps their most daring act, they seduced their targets in taverns or bars, asked if they wanted to \u201cgo for a stroll\u201d in the forest \u2014 and \u201cliquidated\u201d them, as Ms. Oversteegen put it, with a pull of the trigger.\n\n\n\u201cWe had to do it,\u201d she told one interviewer. \u201cIt was a necessary evil, killing those who betrayed the good people.\u201d When asked how many people she had killed or helped kill, she demurred: \u201cOne should not ask a soldier any of that.\u201d\n\n\nAn undated photo of Ms. Oversteegen. (Courtesy of National Hannie Schaft Foundation)\n\n\nFreddie Oversteegen, the last remaining member of the Netherlands\u2019 most famous female resistance cell, died Sept. 5, one day before her 93rd birthday. She was living in a nursing home in Driehuis, five miles from Haarlem, and had suffered several heart attacks in recent years, said Jeroen Pliester, chairman of\u00a0the National Hannie Schaft Foundation.\n\n\nThe organization was founded by Ms. Oversteegen\u2019s sister in 1996 to promote the legacy of Schaft, who was captured and executed by the Nazis weeks before the end of World War II. \u201cSchaft became the national icon of female resistance,\u201d Pliester said, a martyr whose story was taught to schoolchildren across the Netherlands and memorialized in a 1981 movie, \u201cThe Girl With the Red Hair,\u201d which took its title from her nickname.\n\n\nMs. Oversteegen served as a board member in her sister\u2019s organization. But she \u201cdecided to be a little bit out of the limelight,\u201d Pliester said, and was sometimes overshadowed by Schaft and Truus, the group\u2019s leader.\n\n\n\u201cI have always been a little jealous of her because she got so much attention after the war,\u201d Ms. Oversteegen\u00a0told Vice Netherlands in 2016, referring to her sister. \u201cBut then I\u2019d just think, \u2018I was in the resistance as well.\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\n\nIt was, she said, a source of pride and of pain \u2014 a five-year experience that she never regretted, but that came to haunt her in peacetime. Late at night, unable to fall asleep, she sometimes recalled the words of an old battle song that served as an anthem for her and her sister: \u201cWe have carried the best to their graves\/ torn and fired at, beaten till the blood ran\/ surrounded by the executioners on the scaffold and jail\/ but the raging of the enemy doesn\u2019t frighten us.\u201d\n\n\nFreddie Nanda Oversteegen was born in the village of Schoten, now part of Haarlem, on Sept. 6, 1925. Her parents divorced when she was a child, and Freddie and Truus were raised primarily by their mother, a communist who instilled a sense of social responsibility in the young girls; she eventually remarried and had a son.\n\n\nIn interviews with anthropologist Ellis Jonker, collected in the 2014 book\u00a0\u201cUnder Fire: Women and World War II,\u201d\u00a0Freddie Oversteegen recalled that their mother encouraged them to make dolls for children suffering in the Spanish Civil War, and beginning in the early 1930s volunteered with International Red Aid, a kind of communist Red Cross for political prisoners around the world.\n\n\nAlthough living in poverty, sleeping on makeshift mattresses stuffed with straw, the family harbored refugees from Germany and Amsterdam, including a Jewish couple and a mother and son who lived in their attic. After German forces invaded the Netherlands in May 1940, the couples were moved to another location; Jewish community leaders feared a potential raid, because of the family\u2019s well-known political leanings.\n\n\n\u201cThey were all deported and murdered,\u201d Ms. Oversteegen told Jonker. \u201cWe never heard from them again. It still moves me dreadfully, whenever I talk about it.\u201d\n\n\nMs. Oversteegen and her sister began their resistance careers by distributing pamphlets (\u201cThe Netherlands have to be free!\u201d) and hanging anti-Nazi posters (\u201cFor every Dutch man working in Germany, a German man will go to the front!\u201d). Their efforts apparently attracted the attention of Frans van der Wiel, commander of the underground Haarlem Council of Resistance, who invited them to join his team \u2014 with their mother\u2019s permission.\n\n\n\u201cOnly later did he tell us what we\u2019d actually have to do: sabotage bridges and railway lines,\u201d Truus Oversteegen said, according to Jonker. \u201cWe told him we\u2019d like to do that. \u2018And learn to shoot, to shoot Nazis,\u2019 he added. I remember my sister saying, \u2018Well, that\u2019s something I\u2019ve never done before!\u2019 \u201d\n\n\nBy Truus\u2019s account, it was Freddie Oversteegen who became the first to shoot and kill someone.\u201cIt was tragic and very difficult and we cried about it afterwards,\u201d Truus said. \u201cWe did not feel it suited us \u2014 it never suits anybody, unless they are real criminals. .\u2009.\u2009. One loses everything. It poisons the beautiful things in life.\u201d\n\n\nThe Oversteegen sisters were officially part of a seven-person resistance cell, which grew to include an eighth member, Schaft, after she\u00a0joined in 1943. But the three girls worked primarily as a stand-alone unit, Pliester said, acting on instructions from the Council of Resistance.\n\n\nAfter the war ended in 1945, Truus worked as an artist, making paintings and sculptures inspired by her years with the resistance, and wrote a popular memoir, \u201cNot Then, Not Now, Not Ever.\u201d She died in 2016, two years after Prime Minister Mark Rutte awarded the sisters the Mobilization War Cross, a military honor for service in World War II.\n\nFor her part, Freddie Oversteegen told Vice that she coped with the traumas of the war \u201cby getting married and having babies.\u201d She married Jan Dekker, taking the name Freddie Dekker-Oversteegen, and raised three children. They survive her, as do her half brother and four grandchildren. Her husband, who worked at the steel company Hoogovens, is deceased.\n\nIn interviews, Ms. Oversteegen often spoke of the physics of killing \u2014 not the feel of the trigger or kick of the gun, but the inevitable collapse that followed, her victims\u2019 fall to the ground.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she told one interviewer, according to the Dutch newspaper\u00a0IJmuider Courant\u00a0, \u201cI\u2019ve shot a gun myself and I\u2019ve seen them fall. And what is inside us at such a moment? You want to help them get up.\u201d\n\n\n","created_utc":1537372762,"score":63,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Before that, I invited one of them - in addition to some people from Altdorf and Laurenzberg whose entire village have been relocated - to hold a presentation of the topic in the autonomous space I organize in my city. They didn't send anyone.\n\nThat is why I call them hippies. They are funded by charity of people like you and me that sit in heated homes and like to spend money to feel like they are part of the solution rather than the problem. \"Outside capitalism\", give me a break.

I take pride in it and view it as a responsibility to help my tribe and its members when I can. Though the general culture here makes it difficult. Things like domestic violence and child abuse are really common and near impossible to get rid of because no one cares or in some cases are completely fine with it. There's nepotism in the council as they keep giving away positions like judges, administrators, the Chief of Police, etc. to their friends rather than actually qualified individuals and electing better members is difficult because people will only vote for their friends and family rather than efficient leaders. I try to keep a positive mindset, but it's difficult at times. I've also shot someone in self-defense here, he didn't die but there are members who think it was unjustified even though he chased his girlfriend (my friend) to my home. My family and I are close.\n\n2. I am connected here. I've been here my whole life and still maintain contact with most of the tribal members I went to school with.

{"author":"LoganClarkPolitics","body":"I read it. I just disagree. The term 'neckbeard' says only that the person grows a beard on their neck, and only implies that this is a style of beard considered unfashionable (a judgment that seems fairly durable, extending back [at least to the 1800's](https:\/\/historicalfacialhair.wordpress.com\/2009\/05\/12\/henry-david-thoreau-and-the-neckbeard-mid-1800s\/)). If the term 'neckbeard' is coupled with another insult (like 'autistic' as given in your link), then we're now dealing with a compound insult, and each part should be considered separately.\n\nIf someone uses the insult 'autistic neckbeard', the 'autistic' bit is definitely abelist and worthy of criticism. The 'neckbeard' bit is a commentary on their unfashionable style, and is still a dick move, but you don't insult people because you want to be kind to them.\n\nI simply disagree with your link's proposal that this word has packed within it all these other implications.\n\nBesides, shit like Neckbeard Deathcamp is explicitly about being edgy and transgressive. There are certain terms that would still be unacceptable even in that context - for example, if they started calling their targets autistic, but focusing on 'neckbeard' seems to be a pretty tepid critique.

{"author":"Jaksuhn","body":"&gt; What's the difference between anarchism, socialism, and communism, and liberalism and libertarianism and how do they relate to eachother?\n\nOver simplified. Let's start in an order that makes sense:\n\n**Liberalism**: Ideology as old as capitalism itself. It's a capitalist ideology in meaning today but one could argue it wasn't necessarily capitalist a long time ago, but arguing that today is pointless. It's an ideology that came from the critique of monarchism and rejected things like the divine right of kings and instead espoused individualism and liberty.  \n**Libertarianism**\/**Anarchism**: There's two types of libertarianism. The left libertarianism (which I will just lump in with anarchsim to keep it simple) was the first and original. It is based on the critique on the vanguardism of state socialism, which believes a party of vanguards must be the ones to essentially kickstart a revolution. It also goes against the entire notion of needing a state at all during the socialist period. Then there's right libertarianism which also, at least on paper, rejects the idea of a state, though in practice they simply mean they wanted it limited so as to not inconvenience them.  \n**Socialism**: The stepping stone phase from capitalism to communism in which the means of production is transferred over from the capitalist class to the working class.  \n**Communism**: A stateless, classless, moneyless society in which the means of production are held in common.\n\n&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong\n\nYou are correct.\n\n&gt; I don't understand how you can be both because government is relatively big under socialism and communism and anarchism is the lack of government\/state, right?\n\nGovernment != state, first of all. Socialism\/Communism\/Anarchism is life run by the people themselves. To say any contain \"big government\" implies there is some separate entity from the people. Communism and anarchism are entirely stateless. Some socialists are in favour of their being a state in the transitional phase.\n\n&gt; also what's a spook?\n\nIt's an egoist term coined by Stirner long before it was ever a racial term, which it's only a racial term in america.","created_utc":1537516254,"score":7,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Primary_Platform","body":"I suppose two important pieces of literature for any Marxist-Leninist that might be right up your alley would have to be [The Russian Counter-Revolution](https:\/\/cloudfront.crimethinc.com\/assets\/articles\/2018\/05\/11\/the-russian-counterrevolution.pdf) and [Bloodstained: 100 Years of Counter-Revolution](https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/BloodstainedOneHundredYearsOfLeninistCounterrevolution).\n\nThey essentially start with Bakunin's creepy foreshadowing in the 1850's that socialism must be initiated from the ground up (anarchism and direct action), not from the top down (the Marxist-Leninist state). If it was ever controlled from the top down (the Marxist state) then it would monopolize the concept of socialism and become hostile to other socialists. This is what happened in the Soviet Union. Anarchists won the war but were executed by the Bolsheviks afterwards. It's important to remember that there were two revolutions in Russia during 1917 - The Revolution itself and then the counter-revolution.\n\n&gt;Lenin was an intellectual from a bourgeois family who never stopped playing the role of manager. He was the architect of a pseudo-revolutionary state that would be directed by his class. From the beginning, the USSR was a dictatorship of intellectuals and bureaucrats oppressing the exploited classes. Lenin never abandoned his class interests. He called on the workers and peasants to rise up for the same reason that during the Revolution he appropriated anarchist discourses. All of this was calculated to motivate the masses to serve as cannon fodder for his ambitions. On the eve of the Russian Revolution,\nLenin was in contact with the secret police of the German Empire. It was only thanks to them that he was able to return to Russia amid the tumult of the World War. They also gave financial aid to his Party. In exchange, they expected Lenin to pull Russia out of the war, freeing up the Germans\u2019 eastern front. In the end, Lenin was more faithful to the German imperialists than to the workers and peasants. Even though many other Bolsheviks were horrified by his proposed collaboration with Germany, the dictatorship that Lenin had already established within his Party prevailed. Without consulting the Polish and\nUkrainian peoples, historically occupied by Tsarist Russia, Lenin ceded those territories to the German imperialists along with a huge bounty in money and raw materials that contributed to the slaughter of the working class on the Western front.\n\nThe books also go into detail about the murdering of hundreds of thousands of working class socialists while the former Bourgeoisie remained in very comfortable positions as well as it's repression of a true socialist revolution in Spain during the 1930s. Instead of aiding the Spanish revolution, the Soviets chose to aid the fascists and turn on the Spanish working classes.","created_utc":1537541617,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I decided to take the conversation in a different direction, but the point you're making is true.\n\nOP says we shouldn't throw minorities under the bus. I, and any decent person, would agree with that. However, the problem is that, in our ever-evolving language, we allow fairly harmless terms like 'neckbeard' to be appropriated by less-decent people who use it to strike out at the vulnerable among us.\n\nMy argument is this - if we allow these pretty normal words to be imbued with this discriminatory baggage, and all we do is outlaw the word, then we are allowing our enemies control over our language, ownership of our vocabularies. Instead, we should strive to rehabilitate the word to its normal, neutral meaning.\n\nIt's like restorative justice, but for words! ","created_utc":1537552766,"score":8,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}
{"author":"jameswlf","body":"That answer is filled with holes as anything in which he discusses philosophy. Also, he's backtracking, because in his first talks about the subject, he certainly gives the impression that he believes that \"postmodern neo-marxists\" are really Marxists or esentially the same that Marxists. (When they aren't even really Marxist, per his own admission.)\n\nFirst, he speaks of Foucault's discussion of power as same or similar to Marx. Which, first, it isn't a conception original to Foucault that power relations govern society. Really from Plato you can read things like \"the law is made to serve the strong\" and Justice is different depending who's in power. (Republic 338 -339) You don't need a French nor German Philosopher to come up with this idea. \n\nSecond, this \"idea\" in the strong form in which it appears in foucault comes from Nietzsche. Not Marx. Not at ALL. Nietzsche: \" \\[Anything which\\] is a living and not a dying body... will have to be an incarnate will to power, it will strive to grow, spread, seize, become predominant - not from any morality or immorality but because it is *living* and because life simply *is* will to power... 'Exploitation'... belongs to the *essence* of what lives, as a basic organic function; it is a consequence of the will to power, which is after all the will to life.\" (*Beyond Good and Evil,* 259).\n\nThen he says \"postmodernism\" leaves people without an ethic. Well, that's because the problems to which Derrida or Foucault were answering woudln't, coudln't give as a result an ethic, but a series of analyses, analytical tools and methods. It's like saying, well, \"quantum physics leaves its students without an ethic\". Or \"Mathematical Analysis leaves its students without an ethic\". By the nature of radical analyses itself, an ethic is impossible. That would correspond to a different  problem or another step in thought. \n\nAlso, this is even contradictory with how influential he insists it is in \"SJW\" movements... which are ... HIGHLY ETHICAL. \n\nFinally, I don't see the full logical scheme of implication from \"postmodernism\" (seems this means the philosophy of Derrida and Foucault\") to feminism, \"SJW-ism\", etc.  I notice the influence, but I don't know what else is there in the middle. What I'm pretty sure of is that Peterson doesn't know either. \n\n&amp;#x200B;","created_utc":1537552897,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

That leads to too many anarchists using identity as a cudgel to gain status over those less \"woke\" instead of using identity as an opportunity to create greater understanding and unity among comrades.","created_utc":1537556917,"score":44,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Holophonist","body":"&gt; That answer is filled with holes as anything in which he discusses philosophy. Also, he's backtracking, because in his first talks about the subject, he certainly gives the impression that he believes that \"postmodern neo-marxists\" are really Marxists or esentially the same that Marxists. (When they aren't even really Marxist, per his own admission.)\n\nThey are marxists though, just neo-marxists. They are likely disproportionately communist, disproportionately see capitalism as exploitative, etc etc etc. All of the things that identify marxists seem to be prevalent among this group of people. The main point of contention is that \"real marxists\" see class struggle as superordinate to everything else, and think identity politics is basically superficial.\n\n&gt;First, he speaks of Foucault's discussion of power as same or similar to Marx. Which, first, it isn't a conception original to Foucault that power relations govern society. Really from Plato you can read things like \"the law is made to serve the strong\" and Justice is different depending who's in power. (Republic 338 -339) You don't need a French nor German Philosopher to come up with this idea.\n\n&gt;Second, this \"idea\" in the strong form in which it appears in foucault comes from Nietzsche. Not Marx. Not at ALL. Nietzsche: \" [Anything which] is a living and not a dying body... will have to be an incarnate will to power, it will strive to grow, spread, seize, become predominant - not from any morality or immorality but because it is living and because life simply is will to power... 'Exploitation'... belongs to the essence of what lives, as a basic organic function; it is a consequence of the will to power, which is after all the will to life.\" (Beyond Good and Evil, 259).\n\nNot to be nit picky but it would probably help if you had quotes, because I don't know to what degree it's even true that he said these things, seeing as how blatantly people lie about what he's actually said. Did he actually say that this was an original idea of Foucault's?\n\nAlso, if your point is that he doesn't get Foucault totally correct, that's fine, I don't really care. What I care about is this ridiculous complaint about him using the term post modern neo marxist. There is NOTHING wrong with that term. If he gets some of the details wrong about Foucault or Derrida or whoever, I'm less concerned about that. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets some of that stuff wrong, he's human after all. I doubt it's anything that changes his analysis though.\n\n&gt;Then he says \"postmodernism\" leaves people without an ethic. Well, that's because the problems to which Derrida or Foucault were answering woudln't, coudln't give as a result an ethic, but a series of analyses, analytical tools and methods. It's like saying, well, \"quantum physics leaves its students without an ethic\". Or \"Mathematical Analysis leaves its students without an ethic\". By the nature of radical analyses itself, an ethic is impossible. That would correspond to a different problem or another step in thought.\n\n&gt;Also, this is even contradictory with how influential he insists it is in \"SJW\" movements... which are ... HIGHLY ETHICAL.\n\nI have to say, this post is just bizarre in how you seem to be referencing a specific video or speech or something. I vaguely remember him uttering the phrase \"this leaves you without an ethic,\" but I don't remember the full context.\n\nThat being said, quantum physics doesn't give you an ethic, but it also doesn't analyze or critique systems of ethics. It's not philosophy at all. Post modernism is. And while you think it's not a problem for post modernism in its ideal form to not provide an ethic, peterson is talking about individuals behaving in the world, and I have to say it rings *entirely true* that post modern rhetoric and a post modern lens through which to view the world leaves leads people to not have any objective system of ethics. Maybe it's not *supposed* to do that, but it certainly seems to. It's a powerful way of just deconstructing any sort of narrative, and it does exactly that.\n\n&gt;Finally, I don't see the full logical scheme of implication from \"postmodernism\" (seems this means the philosophy of Derrida and Foucault\") to feminism, \"SJW-ism\", etc. I notice the influence, but I don't know what else is there in the middle. What I'm pretty sure of is that Peterson doesn't know either.\n\nHe's describing a group of people that use pieces of marxism and post modernism and do something new. As you just said, you notice the influence. That's what he's talking about. I'm not sure what \"in the middle\" you're talking about. What middle?","created_utc":1537557117,"score":0,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Also, I think the overall quality of anime is just declining in general and it actually may have something to do with what we were discussing. The idea is explored towards the end of this video (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=004mKKbSnEI), if you're interested\/have the time.\n\nThat said, I don't look back entirely negatively on the anime I liked when I was a fan.

Yeah, if you're looking for a resounding \"FUCK WESTERN CIVILIZATION\" nobody's going to hesitate to give that to you but it feels like you're just using that to derail a conversation about toxic rape culture in anime because it's something you're personally into.\n\nNot to be a piece of shit here, but between how you're very upset about people attacking neckbeards and how vigorously you're using buzzwords to defending pedophilia culture in anime you're not painting a great picture of yourself.\n\nDoing this in a thread where you're specifically trying to get people to be more sympathetic to overweight people who live with their parents is just aggressively reinforcing the stereotype of gross nerds that defend horrible things. \n\nYou've completely ruined your persona at this point.

Likewise, because some people are, I'll grant lazily, equating \"fascist\" and \"neckbeard,\" you're claiming that they are by extension equating a whole bunch of negative concepts and stereotypes with neurodivergence.\n\nHowever--and I'm fighting the urge to write this in all caps--the stereotype\/slang term \"neckbeard\" was not created as a term for neurodivergency, as witnessed by the fact that those who equate those two things are forced to *specify* neurodivergency as part of the term in order to be understood as equating them. Similarly, although most bigots are white, if I want to say someone is a bigot, I can't just call them \"white,\" and if I want to say they are white, I can't just call them a \"bigot.\" Not only are the two terms not equivalent, they were not coined as equivalencies.\n\nYeah, lazy stereotypes are stupid, if for no other reason than easy ridicule can mask real threat.

{"author":"FlippyCucumber","body":"Regarding the term Neo-Marxist PoMo you said,\n&gt;No it's a neologism he coined because it fits perfectly.\n\nIt is regarding this point that I'm left confused. It's an assertion for sure. And some people really agree with him. But this assertion lacks depth and rigor. It here that my biggest contention rests with JP.\n\nHe seems to construct an idea of the good, essentializes it, sets up an adversary and says that he and people like him must defend the good. However, both his construction of the good and it's adversaries are knitted together with trite statements without evidence from a neutral position to examine the assertion.\n\nSo when he describes Marxism, it becomes a history of class struggle. Others here have critiqued this analysis as oversimplified. But then it's neo because it's now identity and not class. But, on the most face value criticism would be, so is it a history of identity struggle? And then the next layer, which many on the left are trying to answer, is \"What is the relationship between class and identity?\" Of course this all presuppose that this is all Marx was doing. And that the only person relevant to Marxism is Marx. But of course he isn't. He inspired and gave birth to over a hundred years of people thinking critically. Marxist historians are some of the greatest critiques of his histories (see Asiatic modes of production).\n\nSo the term Neo-Marxism as far as I can tell isn't useful. I would of course love to see a detailed, well structured argument for this, but I have never seen it.\n\n&gt;\u00a0I said it uses post modern argumentation. I'm talking about the blurring of lines between categories, emphasis on contextualization, etc.\n\nThese feature of categorical analysis and context aren't solely Post Modern. It would be silly to say that this belongs to the post modernists. Plato's representation of Socrates demonstrate a him doing this in almost every other interaction. And yet, he's not against the Socratic method. In fact, these techniques are so universal, that it'd be a fool's errand to find someone who didn't use these methods. Of course, \"etc\" could mean anything else. Have you read Barthes? Jean Baudrillard? Gilles Deleuze? \n\nAll this flattens individual thinkers into a mass to represent them without any nuance. But they each had different foci and methods. When Derrida deconstructs a premise it is done with philosophical cogent analysis and Foucault provides historical evidence to support his archeological and genealogical analysis. When I listen to JP talk about post modernism it seems to be fraught with generalizations. It seems that he's started to read Foucault, but that's a development around mid-2017. Otherwise, I get the sense that he's only read a couple of Wikipedia entries. Even here you would see that Derrida spent his late career on incorporating Hediggerean and Levinas' ethics into his earlier realizations.\n\nSo JP's (or perhaps more appropriately, your representation of his) use of argumentation of post-modernism also lacks.\n\nAll of this is before wrestling with the term as a whole. Who are these people? How do they operate? How do they understand Marxism, neo-Marxism and post-modernism? How would they describe themselves? What long term, longitudinal survey studies has he or his colleagues done to understand this group?\n\nWhich brings me to my final concern. You linked to a 2006 study which in which they examined the political views of American professors.\n\nHere is what you wrote:\n&gt;Marxism is massively over represented in Academia (the social sciences. Peterson regularly acknowledges that the harder sciences are still doing ok). Almost 1\/5th of social science professors identify as\u00a0Marxist, and that was in 2006.\n\nA couple of issues are at play here. First, it appears that you are categorizing Academia into two groups, social sciences and hard sciences. This doesn't accurately represent the categories of the paper which are Phys\/bio sciences, social science, humanities, comp sci\/engineering, business, health science, and other. So I'm left wondering what fields on this list are the hard sciences? What are your thoughts on the representation of Marxists in the Humanities? Business?\n\n \"1\/5th of social science professors identifying with Marxists\". I'm inferring here that the social sciences should have an equal percentage of Marxists as the rest of the population? If this is correct, should phys\/bio sciences, which have 0%, have more? Isn't this an ideology of outcome argument? If I am incorrect regarding this, what is it that you are saying?\n\nFinally, you emphasize \"and that was in 2006.\" Which I'm assuming you think it's gotten worse. But the paper notes: \"Consistent with our earlier claim that the\rnumber of moderates in academe appears to be growing, we find that self-described radicalism is much more common among professors who came of age in the 1960s than among younger ones, suggesting significant generational change.\"\n\nYou state \"Marxism is massively over represented in Academia\". But the paper states the exact opposite. \"[S]elf-identified Marxists are rare in academe today.\" So, did you read the section on Marxism?\n\nThese types of arguments presented by Peterson and his followers over represent the activities of the Academe, say it's disseminating to the population at large and serve to distract people from other civic question of greater import.\n\nPeterson isn't a great analytic mind. He is a conservative mind. Which is a mind tuned towards to past and the current structure of power. Rigorous work will always qualify and weaken his construction of society.\n","created_utc":1537591337,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"offwhitegenocide","body":"Cool post, I may as well add some of my thoughts since I'm very important.\n\nIndigenous people have been trying to do this for a while. We have so much comedy that most people aren't remotely aware of. We've been doing \"postmodern comedy\" for a very long time. It's funny to turn stereotypes of us on their heads.  It's funny to use our own stereotypes. It's funny to do Tonto voice and stoitox and German regalia. There is the material fact of how we are depicted in media and just yelling at it to go away will just lead more of us to suicide through one form or another. Mocking these depictions WHILE giving rigorous criticism is the way we've tended to go in terms of genre. And just in terms of accessibility, more sincere people are going to listen to somebody laughing at Avatar while also deconstructing it than they are somebody who just yells at it, as if yelling enough will cause it to disappear. \n\nMore relevant to the topic, the word \"Indian\" has been appropriated to refer to some image of the savage, noble or otherwise, dressed in generic clothes and such and that emotionless face. It's not a standard thing like \"queer\" is in queer theory, but in context most will get you're point.\n\nI recall some artists in Ontario doing some project based off of a statue with an Indian in a canoe. It was some commemoration but they removed the Indian and the canoe and just left the white guy. I forget the whole story because I'm shit at history but some queer Native artists made canoes out of Tim Hortons cups and such and posed seductively in their canoes while wearing either fake regalia or whatever, I really just forget, in the spot of the old Indian. Another smeared a statue of John A. MacDonald on his day with tallow, especially the plaque that just ignores the fact that he called for genocide and fucking scalping while building train tracks through to the West Coast to capture more land. Waaaay worse than anything Trump will ever do, yet so many people will at least speak well of Macdonald while just berating Donald.  This happened roughly at the same time I think.\n\nI've thought a lot about writing something about this (appropriating oppressor imagery) and theistic Satanism and Satanic depiction in art and such, which also uses a sort ironic imagery (pentagram, inverted cross, stigmata, caves, lambs\/goats, immaculate conception, eucharist action vs symbolism, etc), mainly because I think both are interesting, not that there is any real connection between the two. Shit I would just write about black metal and horror movies if I could get paid for it. ","created_utc":1537601305,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Holophonist","body":"&gt;It is regarding this point that I'm left confused. It's an assertion for sure. And some people really agree with him. But this assertion lacks depth and rigor. It here that my biggest contention rests with JP.\n\n&gt;He seems to construct an idea of the good, essentializes it, sets up an adversary and says that he and people like him must defend the good. However, both his construction of the good and it's adversaries are knitted together with trite statements without evidence from a neutral position to examine the assertion.\n\n&gt;So when he describes Marxism, it becomes a history of class struggle. Others here have critiqued this analysis as oversimplified. But then it's neo because it's now identity and not class. But, on the most face value criticism would be, so is it a history of identity struggle? And then the next layer, which many on the left are trying to answer, is \"What is the relationship between class and identity?\" Of course this all presuppose that this is all Marx was doing. And that the only person relevant to Marxism is Marx. But of course he isn't. He inspired and gave birth to over a hundred years of people thinking critically. Marxist historians are some of the greatest critiques of his histories (see Asiatic modes of production).\n\n&gt;So the term Neo-Marxism as far as I can tell isn't useful. I would of course love to see a detailed, well structured argument for this, but I have never seen it.\n\nYou use a lot of words to say very little. So your contention seems to be that a group of people that call themselves Marxists, communists, say they hate capitalism, see the world through the lens of power struggles between groups, but are talking about identity groups rather than class somehow aren't Marxist? You're not really explaining why that is incoherent. That doesn't presuppose that the only person relevant to Marxism is Marx. It also doesn't presuppose that this was all Marx was doing. It presupposes that they share this common trait (among others) with Marxists, and they do.\n\n[\"It posits that social classes and the relationship between them, along with the political structures and ways of thinking in society, are founded on and reflect contemporary economic activity.\"](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Historical_materialism)\n\nYou're not deconstructing anything or making any arguments, just asking questions as if they self evidently expose some sort of issue. What's your actual argument? That it's \"oversimplified\"? Yeah, no shit, it's a label, not a thesis. And it's one everybody seems to acknowledge is correct.\n\n&gt;These feature of categorical analysis and context aren't solely Post Modern. It would be silly to say that this belongs to the post modernists. Plato's representation of Socrates demonstrate a him doing this in almost every other interaction. And yet, he's not against the Socratic method. In fact, these techniques are so universal, that it'd be a fool's errand to find someone who didn't use these methods. Of course, \"etc\" could mean anything else. Have you read Barthes? Jean Baudrillard? Gilles Deleuze?\n\n&gt;All this flattens individual thinkers into a mass to represent them without any nuance. But they each had different foci and methods. When Derrida deconstructs a premise it is done with philosophical cogent analysis and Foucault provides historical evidence to support his archeological and genealogical analysis. When I listen to JP talk about post modernism it seems to be fraught with generalizations. It seems that he's started to read Foucault, but that's a development around mid-2017. Otherwise, I get the sense that he's only read a couple of Wikipedia entries. Even here you would see that Derrida spent his late career on incorporating Hediggerean and Levinas' ethics into his earlier realizations.\n\n&gt;So JP's (or perhaps more appropriately, your representation of his) use of argumentation of post-modernism also lacks.\n\n&gt;All of this is before wrestling with the term as a whole. Who are these people? How do they operate? How do they understand Marxism, neo-Marxism and post-modernism? How would they describe themselves? What long term, longitudinal survey studies has he or his colleagues done to understand this group?\n\nSorry, but no. Postmodernism in particular is about extreme skepticism, and in particular even questioning things like objective reality and truth. The hilarious part is you're employing the exact tactics we're talking about. It's not a coincidence that current day post modernists (like Thaddeus Russel) and SJWs (the post modern neo marxists, as JP would say) are the ones making these ridiculous claims about, for instance, the nature of gender.\n\nAs for your gatekeeping, no I haven't read any of them. Just to give you a heads up, if your tactic is to somehow shame me for not reading Foucault, it's not going to work. Nothing I'm saying relies on a deep understanding of postmodernism, and I have no interest in it. All that matters in this conversation is whether the label makes sense, and it does.\n\n&gt;Which brings me to my final concern. You linked to a 2006 study which in which they examined the political views of American professors.\n\n&gt;Here is what you wrote:\n\n&gt;&gt;Marxism is massively over represented in Academia (the social sciences. Peterson regularly acknowledges that the harder sciences are still doing ok). Almost 1\/5th of social science professors identify as Marxist, and that was in 2006.\n\n&gt;A couple of issues are at play here. First, it appears that you are categorizing Academia into two groups, social sciences and hard sciences. This doesn't accurately represent the categories of the paper which are Phys\/bio sciences, social science, humanities, comp sci\/engineering, business, health science, and other. So I'm left wondering what fields on this list are the hard sciences? What are your thoughts on the representation of Marxists in the Humanities? Business?\n\n&gt;\"1\/5th of social science professors identifying with Marxists\". I'm inferring here that the social sciences should have an equal percentage of Marxists as the rest of the population? If this is correct, should phys\/bio sciences, which have 0%, have more? Isn't this an ideology of outcome argument? If I am incorrect regarding this, what is it that you are saying?\n\n&gt;Finally, you emphasize \"and that was in 2006.\" Which I'm assuming you think it's gotten worse. But the paper notes: \"Consistent with our earlier claim that the number of moderates in academe appears to be growing, we find that self-described radicalism is much more common among professors who came of age in the 1960s than among younger ones, suggesting significant generational change.\"\n\n&gt;You state \"Marxism is massively over represented in Academia\". But the paper states the exact opposite. \"[S]elf-identified Marxists are rare in academe today.\" So, did you read the section on Marxism?\n\n&gt;These types of arguments presented by Peterson and his followers over represent the activities of the Academe, say it's disseminating to the population at large and serve to distract people from other civic question of greater import.\n\n\n1. Nothing I said relies on there being two groups in Academia. This is just a bizarre quibble you seem to be bringing up just so you can fill out your word count.\n\n2. 1\/5 is over representation relative to the general population. So you're confusing \"rarity\" with over representation.\n\n3. As I said, that's people that literally call themselves Marxists, which is an extremely fringe position. What Peterson said is that Marxist rhetoric dominates the Universities.\n\n4. Your quote about de-radicalization isn't really relevant. They're talking about a scale of half a century, my point was that universities, with in the past 2 decades or so, have become far more slanted to the left, so it seems unlikely to have gotten better since 2006, and probably has gotten worse. Unless you somehow think having more of a leftwing echo chamber won't result in more extreme leftwing views? [Source](https:\/\/heterodoxacademy.org\/professors-moved-left-but-country-did-not\/).\n\n&gt;Peterson isn't a great analytic mind. He is a conservative mind. Which is a mind tuned towards to past and the current structure of power. Rigorous work will always qualify and weaken his construction of society.\n\nYou're not being rigorous, you're being obstinate. You're providing no actual arguments, just asking vague questions and ignoring arguments I'm making. But thankfully none of this matters because nobody is listening to you. The only reason I'm here defending him is because I am particularly temperamentally inclined towards defending the truth, even if it's an an inconsequential setting, and make no mistake that's the setting we're in. But just to let you know, if you come back with another wall of text that is just as vapid and devoid of any actual positive arguments, I'm ignoring you.","created_utc":1537628228,"score":-1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

It means that guidelines change quickly and often depending on what catches on.\n\nIt's the process of developing new ways of thinking and of seeing the world. \n\nAnd yeah there are a lot of people who get defensive or hostile if one of these ever-changing \"rules\" is broken, especially if it concerns them.\n\nIt doesn't seem right but keep in mind a lot of them are people who are figuring out who they are and many have a lot of trauma built up over years of people denying them an identity that they felt at home with, sometimes violently.\n\nThat's going to leave a lot of people pretty raw. Imagine you're a trans person and you go through the work of affirming who you are on the inside, the physical changes, the social disruption, you do all that and go through no small amount of pain and loss. You come out on the other side and you're ready to face the world...and someone deadnames you to your face.\n\nIn that instant, everything you've worked for, everything you've fought for, all the pain, all the hurt, all the loss, everything you've dealt with for those years is suddenly invalidated by someone else who has jerked you back into being a person whose identity caused you serious distress.\n\nNow imagine this happens every. single. day. Maybe it's with people you care about, people you love, people you trust. They refuse to accept who you are and insist on clinging to the old identity. They don't care how much trying to be that person felt wrong and how much it hurt, their perception of you is more important than your comfort and it's just grinding it into you every time they do it.\n\nNow, how much patience are you going to have with people you don't know?\n\nIs it right or fair to give someone both barrels for no other reason than they stepped on toes that have been stomped on repeatedly, even if they meant no harm by it and were in fact actively trying to be supportive?\n\nNo, in the grand scheme of things it isn't but it's not hard to see why someone would have less of an ability to deal with people not being aware of things. \n\nI do think people should make a little more of an effort to figure out if someone is genuinely open to hearing new information and correcting themselves if they're off-base. On the other hand I think when we're talking about things that are key to a person's self like their identity, we should expect to find some bruises.","created_utc":1537643736,"score":4,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"GiveMeTheTape","body":"#2nd part\n\n**Second speech**\n\nI want to tell you about the occupation and the mole, we can also have a look at the apartments later. You can ask questions as well. It's these houses, you've probably read about them, Krukmakargatan (pot maker street) 6, 8, 10 and 12 that have been occupated for almost ten months.\n\nSomething important is the background to the decision, last year the main argument was the claim that the foundations was unsafe. Then there's been a lot of talk about it, though we didn't do much of the talking. It has been mainly the politicians that have claimed that the foundations are unsafe. So we've done our own investigations, and it shows that two of these houses stand on a rock foundation, but these two stand on wodden poles. And we've dug a hole and you can look down here later and have a look, and there have been tests taken on those poles by the Wood Research Institute and other experts have had a look and they say that the foundations are good, better than the foundation of the Parliament house that are being are being rebuilt without any \"core-reinforcment\" for several millions of Swedish Crowns.\n\nThey mean that the foundations are so bad that it would cost more to reinforce them than to tear it down and rebuild.\n\nWe then ask ourselves \"Is it worth to preserve this environment?\". One of those are the State Museum that are of the opinion that this old einvornment is very valuable since it's a former barrel factory, and it's different types of residents, the owners lived there and the workers lived there and it's valuable to preserve. But they were misled by the information that the foundations are bad and that it would cost so much. But now that the information is different they say that these buildings could be preserved as well as other buildings.\n\nSo that's why we mean that it's just prestige that this deicision isn't reversed. And that's why the demand for us to dismantle the occupation is that there should at least be an all-round and impartial investigation because this decision is sick from start to finish. It's reminiscent of the Elm Conflict for 7-8 years ago. They said the elms were rotten and couldn't survive, the subway couldn't be built, but now the subway were built and the elms are still alive, and happier than ever we assume.\n\nSo it's fully possible to preserve these buildings.\n\nI don't know if we should start or.. We're so many now so we should take turns\n, I can point to the door where there's aposter about the opear and we can go down there later and have a look. It's not much to see though, but at least you'll have seen it, it's a 3 meter pit. Then we can go to the garden and have a look at an apartment if there's room, there's quite a lot of you here. Ask me, don't be afraid to interrupt me and ask as much as you want.\n\n\n**Interview with architect**\n\n\"Architectu Allan Rubin, you have 10 years experience of turn of the century buildings, renovation of those buildings. And you've had a closer look at these four houses at Krukmakargatan. What is your general impression of these houses and the foundations they stand on?\"\n\n\"I took measurements of them since no one else had done it and it was unclear if it was inaprpirate to rebuild or not. It showed that the framwork was fine, it would be easy to convert them into conventional family residences because the load bearing walls were  placed the way they were placed. They were a good basis to make very nice comfortable apartments according to norms.\"\n\n\"And you've had a look at the foundations as well?\"\n\n\"Yeah, the occupants themselves made a basic survey in the hole and I was down there and had a look, I have also been in contact with the professor from The Technical University that helped us with the evaluation, and it looks perfectly fine there are no disconcerting signs.\"\n\n\"Do you think there are any reasons to preserve this environment?\"\n\n\"For me it's obvious that buildings that are craft sound and that have these qualities and are possible to preserve should be, at list as a first solution. And it may not always work but where it works the final result is much better than completely rebuilding. And it may sounds like you'd have little faith that they could create something of equivalent quality, but it correlates to the fact that there conditions of reconstruction is so poor, it's about doors of masonite, plastic frames and plinths, and a low quality through and through. So reonvation yields a much better result. I also think that you notice on people around you, but union members and others, that when these houses are restored everybody they say that these houses are fantastic and very beautiful, and are amazed at what can be achieved.\"\n\n\"But if you walk around and have a look at these houses now they look very run down, decayed and filthy.\"\n\n\"That's probably one of the reasons so many houses fall apart, as soon as you don't maintain the houses they will look very decayed and so you tink they're bad. You don't think it's only surface level, you think it's through and through. The houses advertise themselves poorly like they are now, butit's about vision. If you fix them up and repaint them they will give a completely different impression. You can see this in this house, it's are exactly the same as Krukmakargatan, same window details, and panels, same types of doors and proportions. And it has been repainted and people say \"this is nice, it looks better than new\". And people who don't work with resoration have a hard time imagining that it can be done.\"\n\n\"If you compare the costs, tear down or debuild versus preserve and renovate?\"\n\n\"That depends on what you do during the restoration process, if you want to build something exactly the same as the new, same type of kitchen same type of bathroom, and sepreate toilets and everything identical, then you have to cause a lot of violence to these houses, it will be both expensive and you have to destroy a lot of that which would be valuable to preserve. But if you adjust and seek for solutions that are adjusted to the house and with a will to compromise. You can have a hat rack that is 80cm instead of statutory 1m, and the countertop in the kitchen can be a bit shorter and have a complementary cabinet in the serving room. There are a lot of possible solutions like this and if you understand that you can get a final result that in spite of some compromises is better than something completely new.\"\n\n\"But these comprmises doesn't entail a common toilet in the stairway?\"\n\n\"Oh no, it's all about adding all amenities that are in newly contructed buildings. The compromises are in the details and entails if the current walls only allows for three dining spots in the kitchen instead of four in a two room apartment as an example. I've seen a lot of where they move entire walls because there must be space for four people in the dining room. This has far reaching consequences. So if you're careful when you renovate it will be cheaper to preserve than tearing it down and rebuild.\"\n\n**Interview with a visitor having a [fika](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Coffee_culture#By_country)**\n\n\"What did you think of this before?\"\n\n\"Well, we've been on a tour here and it has given me a completely different impression than I had before I think.\"\n\n\"What was your impression before you came?\"\n\n\"It was very conflicting, I wasn't the most prejudiced but I had a lot of prejudice and I'm still very hesitant, but I've recieved arguments that I didn't have before.\"\n\n**Interview with old man**\n\n\"What do you think?

(Coming the conception he has of all of these thinkers from the completely evident fact ---for those of us who actually have studied these works-- that he hasn't read them AT ALL, and much less studied them.)\n\n&gt;\"They are marxists though, just neo-marxists. They are likely disproportionately communist, disproportionately see capitalism as exploitative, etc etc etc. All of the things that identify marxists seem to be prevalent among this group of people. The main point of contention is that \"real marxists\" see class struggle as superordinate to everything else, and think identity politics is basically superficial.\n\nHave you seen Contrapoints video at least? I keep pointing to her, because it's easier than reading the papers or the works per se and history, and it's even fun. They aren't \"Neo Marxists\" nor \"Post Modern Neo Marxists\" nor any kind of Marxists, because **THEY AREN'T MARXIST AT ALL.** Words have meaning and what defines Marxism isn't what you say. Seeing capitalism as exploitative isn't an indicator of Marxism. No one has to teach to people about any German philosopher to people working in sweatshops, mines; hell, even some people who work in offices while their bosses get superrich and they can barely survive, to make them suspect that there's some systematic kind of injustice prevaling in society. This has NOTHING to do with Marx AT ALL. Similar incomformities and ideas about systemic injustice are SEEN ALL THROUGHOUT HISTORY. That's why there are continuously rebellions and revolutions: because people see some kind of systemic intolerable injustice oppressing them (the American rEvolution, The French Revolution, all Chinese rebellions, the LAtin Americna Revolutions). That you keep saying these things indicate that again, you don't know anything about Marxism, nor about Foucault nor Derrida. Foucault and Derrida weren't communist and would never point at capitalism as exploitative... not anymore than probably any other system. Again, did you forget that they didn't gave an ethic? All this idea about the exploitativeness of capitalism doesn't seem to belong in a work without ethic, right?\n\nIt's evient that you also haven't studied them and don't know what you are talking about. All that you are you doing is repeating what Peterson told you.\n\n&gt;The main point of contention is that \"real marxists\" see class struggle as superordinate to everything else, and think identity politics is basically superficial.\n\nNo. This isn't the main point of contention. Nor is there possibly a main point of contention. Because Foucault and Derrida talk about very different problems and go through another very different way. Remember that postmodernism leaves people without an ethic? Why'd they care about class struggle (or how could they conceive of identity politics as this is an ethical concept? (Hint: they don't.)\n\n&gt;Not to be nit picky but it would probably help if you had quotes, because I don't know to what degree it's even true that he said these things, seeing as how blatantly people lie about what he's actually said. Did he actually say that this was an original idea of Foucault's?\n\nQuotes? I'm answering to the AMA answer you yourself posted:   [response during his AMA](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Z2MAIyu.png). I never said he had said it was original to Foucault. And he doesn't say that. But he says (WRONGLY) that it's a rehashing of Marx ideas of class warfare. IT ISN'T. THAT IDEA COMES TOTALLY (OR MOSTLY) FROM NIETZSCHE. And it's one of his most uncontroverted ideas: Peterson TALKS ALL THE TIME about hierarchies, about power dominance in almost every situation, about how punching and bullying kids with certain impediments in schools is good for society (It's true. It's in his 12 rules for life when he talks about Lisa Simpson and Nelson). About primates testing others power to decide who's in charge. But he is so IGNORANT AND BLIND, that he can't see that he's taking these ideas from Nietszche... LIKE FOUCAULT DOES. NOT FROM MARX.\n\n&gt;Also, if your point is that he doesn't get Foucault totally correct, that's fine, I don't really care. What I care about is this ridiculous complaint about him using the term post modern neo marxist. There is NOTHING wrong with that term. If he gets some of the details wrong about Foucault or Derrida or whoever, I'm less concerned about that.\n\nMan, what a facepalm... If he doesn't gets the details correct about Foucault or Derrida then he can't be using the term appropiately nor making accusations. That's why it gets people mad. Because he desinforms people and people swallow. The term depends on the meaning of the words \"postmodern\" \"neo\" \"marxist\". And it isn't correct because Foucault wasn't a Marxist at all. Not even \"barely repentat\", but not a Marxist at all. He wasn't even SIMILAR to Marx in ideas. (Even if highly influenced. That's another subject. But anyone who reads AMrx, will be highly influenced by him.) His ideas about power come from Nietzsche not from MArx. The main influence in Foucault wasn't Marx. It was by a long shot NIETZSCHE. And Derrida wasn't inspiried by MArx probably at all, but by HEIDEGGER.\n\n&gt;That being said, quantum physics doesn't give you an ethic, but it also doesn't analyze or critique systems of ethics. It's not philosophy at all. Post modernism is. And while you think it's not a problem for post modernism in its ideal form to not provide an ethic, peterson is talking about individuals behaving in the world, and I have to say it rings *entirely true*that post modern rhetoric and a post modern lens through which to view the world leaves leads people to not have any objective system of ethics. Maybe it's not *supposed* to do that, but it certainly seems to. It's a powerful way of just deconstructing any sort of narrative, and it does exactly that.\n\nWhy'd it give an ethic? Philosophy doesn't have a method nor an object of study nor an essence. It isn't like a bycicle that exists to provide you with a means of transportation. In any case one of its demands is to create works with a strong Will to Truth. There are no rules in philosophy. It's cute that Peterson insists on this because anyone else in academia knows that this is a very silly proposition. What about Nietzsche? Does his proposal of creating your own values (if you can, because it isn't for everyone and of which Peterson dissaproves) sounds like a lot to offer in ethics? What about the Sophists? What about Nietzsche's philosophy which also dismantles reason, Christianity, the self, good? Shouldn't he attack about them too? Why doesn't he ever talk about Nietzche? Except to praise him.\n\nOh, [and it does say a lot about ethics](https:\/\/www.iep.utm.edu\/fouc-eth\/)... [a lot](https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/3744986\/Derrida_and_Ethics).... by the way... but Peterson is very blind and ignorant.  And again, it's a sort of separate step. Not that of the fisrt works. But of those that followed. Thinking again about this... this is another sign that Peterson doesn't know these authors in the least. \n\n&gt; He's describing a group of people that use pieces of marxism and post modernism and do something new. As you just said, you notice the influence. That's what he's talking about. I'm not sure what \"in the middle\" you're talking about. What middle? \n\nRead this:   \n[https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/derrida\/](https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/derrida\/)   \n[https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/foucault\/](https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/foucault\/)\n\nAnd tell me how does from it and it alone follows \"identity politics\" or \"SJWism\".","created_utc":1537716926,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Furthermore, as I pointed out, and you ignored, part of what makes them neo-MARXISTS is the fact that they fundamentally see the course of human events as being power struggles between groups. That's a very marxist notion, but they put an identity spin on it. Furthermore, as I pointed out, and you ignored, they are disproportionately self-identifying MARXISTS. Almost 20% of social science professors identify as Marxists, which is fucking absurd. Notice how you're not really saying anything at all? You're just being obstinate and stubborn; declaring that they're not Marxists with no reasoning or rationale whatsoever.\n\n&gt;No. This isn't the main point of contention. Nor is there possibly a main point of contention. Because Foucault and Derrida talk about very different problems and go through another very different way. Remember that postmodernism leaves people without an ethic? Why'd they care about class struggle (or how could they conceive of identity politics as this is an ethical concept? (Hint: they don't.)\n\nWhat you quoted has nothing to do with post modernism or foucault or derrida at all. I'm saying the point of contention between oldschool Marxists and these neo-Marxists is that oldschool Marxists see class as the main driver of conflict.\n\n&gt;Quotes? I'm answering to the AMA answer you yourself posted: response during his AMA. I never said he had said it was original to Foucault. And he doesn't say that. But he says (WRONGLY) that it's a rehashing of Marx ideas of class warfare. IT ISN'T. THAT IDEA COMES TOTALLY (OR MOSTLY) FROM NIETZSCHE. And it's one of his most uncontroverted ideas: Peterson TALKS ALL THE TIME about hierarchies, about power dominance in almost every situation, about how punching and bullying kids with certain impediments in schools is good for society (It's true. It's in his 12 rules for life when he talks about Lisa Simpson and Nelson). About primates testing others power to decide who's in charge. But he is so IGNORANT AND BLIND, that he can't see that he's taking these ideas from Nietszche... LIKE FOUCAULT DOES. NOT FROM MARX.\n\nThe fuck are you talking about? Marxism as an ideology is inextricably linked to the notion that history has been guided by class struggle. That's the entire fucking point of dialectical materialism. What you're saying is so bizarre and wrong that I'm struggling to even find words to say.\n\n&gt;Man, what a facepalm... If he doesn't gets the details correct about Foucault or Derrida then he can't be using the term appropiately nor making accusations. That's why it gets people mad. Because he desinforms people and people swallow. The term depends on the meaning of the words \"postmodern\" \"neo\" \"marxist\". And it isn't correct because Foucault wasn't a Marxist at all. Not even \"barely repentat\", but not a Marxist at all. He wasn't even SIMILAR to Marx in ideas. (Even if highly influenced. That's another subject. But anyone who reads AMrx, will be highly influenced by him.) His ideas about power come from Nietzsche not from MArx. The main influence in Foucault wasn't Marx. It was by a long shot NIETZSCHE. And Derrida wasn't inspiried by MArx probably at all, but by HEIDEGGER.\n\nNo it gets people mad because you are autistic troglodytes. Listen to yourself. You're completely unhinged by the fact that he says Foucault was highly influenced by Marx. I don't know enough about Foucault to say whether or not that's true, but nothing you've said makes me trust your interpretation whatsoever, so I'll remain agnostic on it. Thankfully, nothing I'm saying requires that to be true. As I said, I'm defending the idea that there is nothing wrong with the term postmodern neo-marxist. There isn't. Again, if he gets some of the details about Foucault wrong, I don't care. It's possible he's wrong. It's also possible he's not.\n\n&gt;Why'd it give an ethic? Philosophy doesn't have a method nor an object of study nor an essence. It isn't like a bycicle that exists to provide you with a means of transportation. In any case one of its demands is to create works with a strong Will to Truth. There are no rules in philosophy. It's cute that Peterson insists on this because anyone else in academia knows that this is a very silly proposition. What about Nietzsche? Does his proposal of creating your own values (if you can, because it isn't for everyone and of which Peterson dissaproves) sounds like a lot to offer in ethics? What about the Sophists? What about Nietzsche's philosophy which also dismantles reason, Christianity, the self, good? Shouldn't he attack about them too? Why doesn't he ever talk about Nietzche? Except to praise him.\n\n&gt;Oh, and it does say a lot about ethics... a lot.... by the way... but Peterson is very blind and ignorant. And again, it's a sort of separate step. Not that of the fisrt works. But of those that followed. Thinking again about this... this is another sign that Peterson doesn't know these authors in the least.\n\nI'm sorry but reading your meandering and hysterical diatribes is getting kind of tiring. What are you asking me? Why he doesn't talk about the problems with Nietzsche's Ubermensch? If he doesn't then how did you know that he \"dissaproves\" of it, like just said a few sentences prior?\n\n&gt;Read this:\n\n&gt;https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/derrida\/\n\n&gt;https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/foucault\/\n\n&gt;And tell me how does from it and it alone follows \"identity politics\" or \"SJWism\".\n\nWho said it ALONE follows idpol or SJW?","created_utc":1537721454,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"jameswlf","body":"&gt; What you're not refuting is what JP's actual position is, which is that there is a bizarre alliance or mixing up concepts from both going on. \n\nAgain. WORDS HAVE MEANING. He can't just invent words and use verbs and nouns and prefixes however he pleases because at worst he will be lying and at best he'll be confusing his audience turning his message into something different to what he intended. \n\nThen, that wasn't his position. He has been backtracking a little every now and then. And it seems so have you. Who now are saying that it means that there is \"mixing up\" of concepts or a \"bizarre alliance\" going on. When you pointed out first for clarification to Peterson's position in his AMA answer, where he says that Foucault's power conception is a rehashing of Marx's class warfare. (Literally, this is complete and total mistake, that could only come from someone who hasn't read Foucault's work.) Soemthign more than \"mixing up\". \n\nFoucault doesn't see power struggles between groups. That isn't a characteristic of postmodernism or his work. That itself is a grand narrative. Like any about \"oppressors\" and \"oppressed\". Something that is completely absent in the work of Foucault, and I'm sure also in Derrida. Foucault sees, like Nietzsche, that power is present in all moment in society or life. And it manifests not only between groups, but intra-groups, between \"individuals\", between man and nature if you will. In the creation of truth, etc. Everywhere or almost everywhere. Not just between groups, nor between oppressors and oppressed. \n\n&gt;\"All things are subject to interpretation. Whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth. \" - Nietzsche, Daybreak  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\[Anything which\\] is a living and not a dying body... will have to be an incarnate will to power, it will strive to grow, spread, seize, become predominant - not from any morality or immorality but because it is *living* and because life simply *is* will to power... 'Exploitation'... belongs to the *essence* of what lives, as a basic organic function; it is a consequence of the will to power, which is after all the will to life.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Beyond Good and Evil,* s.259 \n\nIf you see it as similar to what MArx says, you are very wrong. It's very very very very different. There's no metanarrative here about \"historical progression\", about \"oppressors\" and \"oppressed\" (there are at some point sometimes, but it isn't medualr tot he narrative. I mean, anyone can see that some groups are oppressed at some points, like blacks during segregation or when they were sold as slaves. There's not denying that.) Though relationships of power don't end with legal equality on paper. Yet this is completely different to what Marx said, and it's very obvious of course. \n\nAlso, being very influenced by a thinker, doesn't mean that you follow him, that you qualify as \"one of his school\". Plato was highly, very highly, influenced by Parmenides... but  he clearly wasn't Parmenidean!!!!  On the contrary, he refuted him. The modern logicians were highly influenced by the scholastics, yet, they weren't Christians!!! The Chruch Fathers were highly influyenced by the Pagan philosophers, yet they weren't pagan. Heidegger was highly influenced by Husserl, yet he wasn't Husserlian. On the contrary, he refuted him too. Einstein was greatly influenced by Newton, yet he wasn't a Newtonian. \n\nSo you see, I'm not refuting the words, nor is contrapoints, nor cuck philosophy. We are refuting the concept that such words represent. It doesn't stand that Foucault and Derrida were Marxists, nor \"essentially the same that Marxists\". Nor anything that could justify that choice of words. (and if Peterson didn't mean that they were literally MArxists, he wouldn't have chosen those words.

There's plenty of alternatives if he actually didn't believe that they were esentially the same that MArx. )\n\nYou make assumptions that are very naive, and yet somehow very common. I really don't know why. Like seeing capitalism as exploitative is a MArixst notion. It isn't. It's also an idea absent from the philosophy of Derrida or Foucault. The idea existed way before Marx. There has always been people who suspect or think that  the systems under which they live are unjust somehow. including of course capitalism. How could it not be like that? Is this system or any other perfectly just? I'll give you a hint: in Foucault, the notion of justice is absurd. So yes, capitalism is exploitative and unjust. But so is communism and socialism. Or democtraci socialism. Or anarchism. Or fascism. Or any other system. At least in some way. in Derrida there's somethign similar I think... in accepting that contradictory readings of anything are always present. \n\nThis is completely against Marxism. Marxism makes it clear that communism is at least a step in the right direction. This is totally absent in Foucault or Derrida. \n\nSeeing capitalism as exploitative is also not a Marxist idea. Literally you think that people working for scraps in abject poverty in some industries don't think or suspect that they are being exploited? that they somehow need a German philosopher to think of that? Capitalism is exploitative not in the view of Marx, but in the view of capitalists themselves, who interpreted the profit motive as the motor of production and reliability and man as selfish. It has nothing to do with Marx. A capitalist economist will tell you that the reason why your boss hired you, is not because he wants to do you a favor and is very generous, but because he knows he'll extract some profit from you. (He'll exploit you for a profit.) This is not the view of capitalism of Marxists, it's literally the view of capitalism of any economist. We are valuable in the work force because we can be exploited (used to gain some greater profit). And that's why we are paid, because we are exploitable. And so is nature for example. A forest is worthy under capitalism as a way to extract profit, be it through tourism or by selling the wood that you cut from trees. Literally if there's something in which Marxists and common economists agree is that capitalism is about exploitation: of man and nature.   \n\n\n&gt; I'm sorry but reading your meandering and hysterical diatribes is getting kind of tiring. What are you asking me? Why he doesn't talk about the problems with Nietzsche's Ubermensch? If he doesn't then how did you know that he \"dissaproves\" of it, like just said a few sentences prior? \n\nA lot of what he sees in \"the postmodernists\" (even the term isn't very appropiate, as the postmodernists are those coming after Hegel and Nietzsche for the most part) is present in Nietzsche, (who's the greatest influence in Foucault; and very influential in Heidegger, who's the main influence in Derrida) \"relativism\", \"lack of ethics\", \"irrationalism\".  \n\n&gt; Who said it ALONE follows idpol or SJW? \n\nYou asked what I meant from \"in between\". Derrida and Foucault never supported identity politics. Nor is it part of their works. Perhaps there's something like a sketch of that somewhere in there? I haven't seen it myself. Identity politics seems very influenced by foucault and Derrida... but the scheme of implication is incomplete... you need something else to get to the creation of those social movements.

{"author":"Holophonist","body":"&gt;Again. WORDS HAVE MEANING. He can't just invent words and use verbs and nouns and prefixes however he pleases because at worst he will be lying and at best he'll be confusing his audience turning his message into something different to what he intended.\n\n&gt;Then, that wasn't his position. He has been backtracking a little every now and then. And it seems so have you. Who now are saying that it means that there is \"mixing up\" of concepts or a \"bizarre alliance\" going on. When you pointed out first for clarification to Peterson's position in his AMA answer, where he says that Foucault's power conception is a rehashing of Marx's class warfare. (Literally, this is complete and total mistake, that could only come from someone who hasn't read Foucault's work.) Soemthign more than \"mixing up\".\n\n&gt;Foucault doesn't see power struggles between groups. That isn't a characteristic of postmodernism or his work. That itself is a grand narrative. Like any about \"oppressors\" and \"oppressed\". Something that is completely absent in the work of Foucault, and I'm sure also in Derrida. Foucault sees, like Nietzsche, that power is present in all moment in society or life. And it manifests not only between groups, but intra-groups, between \"individuals\", between man and nature if you will. In the creation of truth, etc. Everywhere or almost everywhere. Not just between groups, nor between oppressors and oppressed.\n\nNone of this is relevant to the mere existence of the term \"postmodern neo-marxist,\" which is what we're talking about. I don't care if Foucault \"sees power struggles between groups.\" And I'm not backtracking at all. As I said in my first post: They're MARXIST because of all of the traits that are similar to Marxism: seeing history as a struggle between groups (identity instead of social classes, which is why they're neo-marxist), typical marxist critique of capitalism (ie exploitation), they even disproportionately identify AS MARXISTS. They're postmodern in their skepticism toward objective reality when it comes to things like race and gender. So nothing I'm saying relies on Foucault being a Marxist. Nothing I'm saying relies on these people being full blown postmodernists, and definitely not faithfully interpreting postmodern thinkers.\n\nI've also said to you multiple times that I'm not claiming that Peterson gets all of the details about Foucault right. I don't care. It's not relevant to anything I'm saying. But on that note, as I've also already said, nothing you've said indicates that you're trustworthy, honest or knowledgeable enough to take your word for it. So I'll remain agnostic about that. It's totally possible Peterson is wrong, it's also possible he's right.\n\n&gt;If you see it as similar to what MArx says, you are very wrong. It's very very very very different. There's no metanarrative here about \"historical progression\", about \"oppressors\" and \"oppressed\" (there are at some point sometimes, but it isn't medualr tot he narrative. I mean, anyone can see that some groups are oppressed at some points, like blacks during segregation or when they were sold as slaves. There's not denying that.) Though relationships of power don't end with legal equality on paper. Yet this is completely different to what Marx said, and it's very obvious of course.\n\n&gt;Also, being very influenced by a thinker, doesn't mean that you follow him, that you qualify as \"one of his school\". Plato was highly, very highly, influenced by Parmenides... but he clearly wasn't Parmenidean!!!! On the contrary, he refuted him. The modern logicians were highly influenced by the scholastics, yet, they weren't Christians!!! The Chruch Fathers were highly influyenced by the Pagan philosophers, yet they weren't pagan. Heidegger was highly influenced by Husserl, yet he wasn't Husserlian. On the contrary, he refuted him too. Einstein was greatly influenced by Newton, yet he wasn't a Newtonian.\n\n&gt;So you see, I'm not refuting the words, nor is contrapoints, nor cuck philosophy. We are refuting the concept that such words represent. It doesn't stand that Foucault and Derrida were Marxists, nor \"essentially the same that Marxists\". Nor anything that could justify that choice of words. (and if Peterson didn't mean that they were literally MArxists, he wouldn't have chosen those words. He would have called them \"quasi-Marxists\", \"para-marxists\", \"Marxistoids\". There's plenty of alternatives if he actually didn't believe that they were esentially the same that MArx. )\n\n\n&gt;This is completely against Marxism. Marxism makes it clear that communism is at least a step in the right direction. This is totally absent in Foucault or Derrida.\n\nHoly fucking shit why did I read a wall of text that refutes nothing I've said? What is wrong with you? Why are you monologuing at me? I'd like for you state what you think my position is, and tell me how anything you just said refutes it.\n\n&gt;You make assumptions that are very naive, and yet somehow very common. I really don't know why. Like seeing capitalism as exploitative is a MArixst notion. It isn't. It's also an idea absent from the philosophy of Derrida or Foucault. The idea existed way before Marx.

A forest is worthy under capitalism as a way to extract profit, be it through tourism or by selling the wood that you cut from trees. Literally if there's something in which Marxists and common economists agree is that capitalism is about exploitation: of man and nature.\n\nFirst of all, you can cut with the dishonest horseshit. The hilarious thing about this conversation (and the others I'm having in this thread) is how you all use these same tactics where you try to tear down obvious truths that nobody denies with just extreme skepticism. You're literally trying to tell me that the notion of capitalism being exploitative isn't Marxist. Look up capitalist exploitation and tell me what names come back. It's going to be predominantly Marx, because it **IS A MARXIST IDEA**. It doesn't mean nobody has ever thought about it before Marx, or thought about it on their own without his influence, but if there's a young college student reeling against the exploitation of capitalism, there's pretty fucking good bet they're influenced by Marx. Especially when they show up to speeches with hammer and sickle iconography. And especially when almost 20% of social scientists are self-avowed Marxists. I want you to answer this question honestly: The group of people that we're talking about, the extreme SJWs, the radical leftwing activist professors in the social sciences, etc. The \"post modern neo-marxists.\" If they were polled, asking questions designed to assess their affinity for Marx, do you think their answers would put them closer to Marx than the general population? Do you think their answers would warrant calling them Marxist by any sort of straightforward measure? PLEASE answer that honestly, because I'm tired of you dancing around the obvious fact that these people are Marxists.\n\nFurthermore, you're just wrong about what exploitation is in the Marxist sense, if you think mainstream economists agree with it. The point of Marxian exploitation is that wealth is being extracted from workers by the ownership class. That is outdated and debunked. It's wrong. Marxists think that, and basically ONLY Marxists. What the rest of the world knows is that owners create value as well, and it's the joining of owners and workers that produces more value than would be created on their own. That's not extracting wealth from people, that's creating new wealth entirely.","created_utc":1537735220,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

That assumption is that owners control \"the means of production\" (lol), and therefore can force workers to take jobs that pay less than the value their work creates. This is false.

But fine, whatever, I'm glad we're now on the same page that these people have a Marxist strain to them at least. So given that, the fact that they have an idpol veneer over top is why they're being called neo-marxists, because marx did't really give a shit about identity politics, obviously. He was much more focused on class struggle.\n\nSo, that's why they're neo-marxists. Why they're postmodern neo-marxists is because they employ the heavy skepticism of objective reality in all sorts of their argumentation. They use it when talking about gender, they use it when talking about race, they even use it when trying with all of their might to ignore the obvious successes of capitalism. And you need to understand this: **I'm not saying they are faithfully living up to postmodernism as a whole. This is why it's an adjective. They are neo-marxists with a postmodern flavor.**\n\nI'm done defending my usage of a word to you, to be honest. I've given you the reasoning, and it's coherent. The only quibble you have is to get into the weeds of your esoteric interests about postmodernism that have no relevance to anything I'm saying. I'm not claiming to know all about pomo, I'm not claiming that these kids and professors do either. I know that \"real\" postmodernists disagree with their conclusions.\n\n","created_utc":1537754901,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"GreasyAssMechanic","body":"As far as power vacuum is concerned: If we get to the point that there's a power vacuum, we've fucked up seriously somewhere along the way. The whole idea of building dual power is to develop structures of support so that the power vacuum never occurs in the first place. The power vacuum happens when the \"revolution\" happens before the parallel structures are built, meaning that forces of reaction have just as much of a stake in the vacuum as we would. \n\nIn terms of invasion (and you mentioned the USA specifically), it's really not something we have to worry about all that much. The US is strategically uninvadeable, to the East and the West we have two vast oceans, to the North we have a huge country that gets very very cold (remember every time someone tried to invade Russia and got beat by the winter?), and to the South the only land route is a relatively small strip of desolate desert that consumes lives daily and would bottleneck any forces that want to invade through a relatively small area. If an invading force somehow did manage to set up the needed logistics to support a long term invasion and gain enough ground after a landing to allow for follow on invasions, the only geographical area that really lends itself to modern warfare is the midwest. The West coast is mountainous, the rockies are obviously mountainous, the North is prohibitively cold, the South West is a vast desert, and the South and East Coasts are one gigantic swamp. All of the above reasons that would make it difficult to maintain an invasion also make the US a guerrilla's wet dream, not to mention that there are huge swaths of metropolitan areas that would be an Urban hells cape for an invading force. Couple this with the fact that the US has a gun culture like no other the world has seen and I just don't see what a country could possibly find here that they couldn't find elsewhere. \n\nAlso the idea that a revolutionary (post) United States wouldn't have a military isn't really backed up in historical fact. All revolutionary societies have some form of armed wing, the question is rather how it would be organized. This is another discussion for another thread (though one I'd be happy to have).\n\nAll in all, it's an interesting thought experiment, but really not all that pressing or important. We have much bigger issues to tackle as radicals in the US than a far off and unlikely ground invasion, and while talking about these things is interesting, I'm more interested in discussing how we keep the lights on, the bellies fed, and the people healthy in a revolutionary society.

Go ask around your vegetarian or vegan shops, if they have any leftovers they would otherwise throw away. Make contacts with your local community.

What type of pots and other cookware will you use? How do you transport things? Will you also bring the necessary cutlery and plates or will you tell the homeless to bring their own cutlery?\n\nThis is a different for every FnB chapter. Some chapters in smaller cities deal with less hungry people (like 30-40) and some deal with a hundred hungry people. But still, even for 15-20 people you can't cook in ordinary two liter pots. You need something bigger. But a big cookwear can be usually bought cheaply at pawn shops\/army surplus stores\/from people you know (depends). And unless you'll tell the homeless to bring their own cutlery, you'll need to buy cutlery every once in a while because it\n will get lost\/stolen. Also, unless you're cooking at some squat, you'll have to pay for the gas or electricity (and water of course). Or you could also cook at some church with their permission (usually, churches have some food donation programs and cook food themselves and will have their kitchens). But still, you will need some form of a transport. A car is the best. And that will require at least to but some gas which is expensive these days.\n\nAlso, it is handy to know that many chapters around the world do some beneficial concerts\/events where people can choose if they want to sponsor their local FnB chapter with some donations. Your chapter should do those too from time to time.\n\nI'd imagine that the cheapest way to run an FnB chapter is at the local church kitchen using their cookware and using cheap plastic cutlery and choosing a close enough location that you can comfortably get there by foot or by bike using trailers.\n\nGood luck!","created_utc":1537773240,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"abhuman","body":"&gt;Do you see any problem calling yourself a minority because you\u2019re neurodivergent? Doesn\u2019t that kind of minimize the outward oppression many ethnic\/religious\/gender\/sexuality minorities experience?\n\nI'm a native-English-speaking white male who passes as cis-het. I'm autistic. I'm also a human trafficking survivor. That awful shit those poor children crossing the border were subjected to, being taken from their families and locked up and tormented and neglected and some of them sexually abused? That was my childhood, solely because I'm autistic. So no, I personally don't see a problem with some neurodivergent folks considering themselves minorities on account of their neurodivergence.\n\nDepression might be considered a neurodivergent condition, but it's qualitatively different from something like autism. For one, while most people don't experience major depressive disorder, almost everyone has experienced some degree of depression, so most folks can relate to it. Nobody who isn't some degree of autistic can relate to autism. For another, practically every mental health professional out there could treat my depression if I weren't autistic; maybe one in a hundred could effectively treat my comorbid depression and complex PTSD. Add in the autism and we're down to one in a thousand, being generous.\n\nWhat I'm getting at is, I understand why you think that suffering from major depressive disorder isn't equivalent to being an oppressed minority - it really hasn't been since lobotomies went out of style. But some neurodivergent conditions can result in real oppression, of the locked-up-in-a-state-funded-rape-factory kind. So maybe neurodivergence in itself isn't enough to qualify as an oppressed minority, but that doesn't mean that nobody qualifies as an oppressed minority on account of their neurodivergence.","created_utc":1537812904,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Citrakayah","body":"Environmentalism in America (which is where most primitivists seem to be) comes from different roots. The modern American environmentalist movement is heavily influenced by Thoreau and Muir. The closest person you'd have to a proto-fascist among its ancestors is Emerson, who was actually in favor of cosmopolitanism and what fascists would denounce as \"racial mixing.\"\n\nThat doesn't undermine most of what the book is arguing, to be sure, but it does complicate things somewhat if you want to draw conclusions about American green anarchists, be they primitivist or not. Equally complicating it is the fact that it wasn't just environmentalist Romantics who used a \"natural order\" to justify a social order; rationalist Enlightenment figures did it too. This is especially a complication for *you*, because by making this argument, you open transhumanism up for a similar critique.\n\nAlso, your ending is trash. You make a lot of claims but don't give much reason for why we should believe them, and if you're actually right about \"upside-down treehouses\" and superintelligent AI, then it's reasonable to say that humans have the ability to live in harmony with the environment. If you're wrong about that, then humans won't have the technical ability to disentangle themselves from it.\n\nAnother problem is that humans are ecosystem engineers, and have been for quite some time. In Eastern Africa, for instance, herders at low population densities increase landscape heterogeneity by creating areas of high fertility. There's actually a species of gecko that lives almost entirely in those areas.\n\nI will also point out that the Sahara is an ecosystem as deserving as respect as any other, and talking about \"regrowing\" it always makes me queasy. I've seen a lot of it lately, and I don't think people who propose this understand how important deserts are, and that a lot of plant and animals (many of them endemic) live in the Sahara. \"Regrow\" it and you wipe them out.\n\n(I'm responding to your essay because, well, you used this opportunity to advertise it, and the only other thread I can find about it is three months old.

{"author":"rechelon","body":"While I wasn't tilting at green anarchism specifically -- I think John for example is a legit anarchist albeit mistaken and have always maintained that -- I find your claim about vastly distinct traditions weird as fuck. Environmentalists pull eclectically, in any tree sit there's going to be wildly different takes and influences, centuries later the cross pollination is so strong as to make the notion of distinct traditions suspect. My point was to point out the reactionary tendencies of \"natural order\" style arguments. (And I mean Muir was certainly pretty fucking racist.) \n\nMy argument in that piece isn't that fashy german environmentalism infected American environmentalism (although there is massive transmission) but that the same deep issues plaguing a certain reactionary defense of nature apply not just in germany but everywhere that it arises. Green anarchists that break with this worship of \"natural order\" have nothing to fear from this critique, same as transhumanists since the whole of transhumanism is predicated on refuting and breaking with \"natural order\" arguments. Yes, absolutely there were shit enlightenment figures, but transhumanism marks an explicit break with this sort of reasoning.\n\nAs to the ending, well I'm not sure precisely what you disagree with but it's a book review, not a place to lay out in detail arguments around technological possibilities. It's merely incumbent upon me to lay out the alternate narrative, not spend the length of a book defending it from all critiques. But I certainly don't think that our capacity to disentangle ourselves significantly from the biosphere necessitates AI. My entire argument is that I think our calculational capacity is presently and probably in the future too limited to understand our relations to our ecosystem. It's just that we can't stop thinking and fucking with shit, so we should try to constrain the damage we do by removing ourselves from our global habitats and support chains. Biodome style isolation where we seek to manage merely the things necessary to keep ourselves alive while having to directly maintain and deal with our pollutants is complex but certainly achievable without superintelligent AI.","created_utc":1537818597,"score":4,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

It's also NOT what mainstream economists believe, that's why Marxian economists is literally referred to as a heterodox school of economic thought, because it breaks from the mainstream.\n\nI know. I agree with you. I never said they would agree with the labor theory of value that MArx proposed. I said they'd agree that *it is exploitative*. Not that they would think that's bad. Not that they would think that it's exploitative in the same way that Marx thought. I never said that nor gave you a sign of proposing such thing. I only said they'd agree it's exploitative.\n\nMy interests aren't even a little esoteric. Literally anyone seriously interested in the fields to which these thinkers contributed (ethics, politics, ontology, history, epistemology, philosophy of science, history of ideas, metaphysics) knows many if not all of these things I've been discussing with you. Excepts critics who are allergic to them like you and Peterson who haven't even opened the books to see what they say.\n\nFirst you said they shared anything that essentially made them Marxists or essentially the same that Marxists so that's why it was a good use of them term. I told you it isn't. \\*\\*(\\*\\****This is the only thing that could justify the use of the term anyway, so as to not confuse or lie to the audience: to call them Marxists only if they are LITERALLY Marxists.***)\n\nThen you said that having some resemblance or similarity is a good use of the term. *And we were talking about FOUCAULT AND DERRIDA. Not the professors nor students.* It's these two to whom Peterson referred first as \"Postmodern Neo Marxists\". Then you gave me the points in which you think there's resemblance: the power idea in Foucault is analogous to the one of Marx, you said. (It isn't. I mean, it's not even similar. It's something completely different. It doesn't resemble it at all.) Identity politics: there's nothing in Foucault or Derrida about identity politics or about groups of oppressors and oppressed,\n\n**Then you MOVE the goalposts and say you actually meant the professors in Academia (and students too, perhaps?) OMG.**\n\nThat skepticism which you call Marxist or postmodern Marxist has nothing to do with Marx necessarilly. While it's very common to the postmodern theorists and those who work theoretically supporting themselves with them it's not even foreing to  the West. You could see the late Academy being already incredibly skeptical as well as people like Hume. Or Nietzsche.\n\n# Your conclusion is completely confused and confusing.\n\nSharing some contingent characteristics with objects in a category doesn't make you belong into that category. Not even sharing some essential characteristics, but not all, places you in that category. It's only sharing the essential and necessary characteristics what actually places you in that set. Sharing some characteristics which may be common to objects in both sets doesn't place you necessarilly in the other unless you share the essentials.\n\nExample: All Marxists smoke tobacco in the afternoon. Many postmodernists smoke tobacco in the afternoon too.Conclusion: Many postmodernists are Marxists. (Ridiculous conclusion based on the premises.)\n\nAnother example:\n\nAll Marxists dislike capitalism and think its unjustly exploitative. Most postmodernists dislike capitalism and think it's unjust.\n\nConclusion: Most postmodernists are Marxists. No, they aren't. Neither of these characteristics is essential to postmodernism, nor is all that it takes to be a Marxist so that you coould say someone who shares them belongs to the set of Marxists.\n\nHere you can see where is the error. You are doing the same.  ***And you misunderstood the point of the questions I wrote.***\n\n&gt;\"Do you believe in a metanarrative of exploitation of the proletariat? \"do you believe in a Marxist theory of History?\" \"Do you use Marxist understanding of culture and material conditions as a way of analyzing society or understanding it?\" \"Do you believe in the Labor Theory of Value as presented by Marx?\" \"Do you believe the MArxist concept of alienation is a correct depiction of the condition of the subject under capitalist wage labor?\" \"Do you believe the concept of ideology in Marx is correct?\"\n\nTo most of these questions, a Marxist would answer yes. **A postmodernist would ANSWER NO TO EACH AND ALL OF THEM.**\n\n# Again, it isn't. If you only mean that pomos are similar to marxists the appropiate terms are: quasi-Marxist, para-Marxist, post-Marxist, Marxistoid...

Could it be that she simply wants to fulfill a sense of justice?  If so, try expressing your feelings and beliefs.  There are far better ways to fulfill a sense of justice than working for an organization that is used as a tool of oppression.\n\nB: If there is a branch of law enforcement that I can stomach, its forensics.  If more good people like your girlfriend got more busy proving people innocent, as have many forensic technicians, then there would be fewer innocent people in US prisons.  That is a good thing.  \n\nC: You don't have to work for the government to solve crimes.  Wikileaks exposes crime, as do many others.  The system IS committing crimes.  They require law enforcement by the people.\n\nAs for your friend:\n\nA: There is no such thing as a non-combatant role in a US military organization.  Sure, 99% is drills and training and burning trillions of dollars for no reason.  However, when shit hits the fan (and the US is usually fighting some kind of war) they will have blood on their hands.  I have several former schoolmates and colleagues who joined the US military for college or \"non-combatant experience\" and ended up in the back of a plane to Iraq or Afghanistan.  Not all returned.  And ALL of them saw and did things they didn't sign up for that they cannot forget.\n\nB: Walk them through the history of the US Air Force, the actions they have committed both against militants and civilians - and ask them if that is the type of thing they want to enable?  Because whether you are a fighter pilot, or a mechanic who changes the hydraulic fluid on a refueling plane - guess what that refuelling plane does?  Fuels the fighter so it can deliver a bomb to an entire city block the US government \"figures\" has someone dangerous in it.\n\nUltimately, you are young.  I'm not still in touch with many people I went to highschool with.  A few from college.  That's about it.  So at the end of the day, don't sweat it too much, you will look back and be less concerned than you are today.

{"author":"enodragon1","body":"I take no issue with the principle of marriage. Humans by nature tend to be monogamous, and even those who are polyamorous may consolidate their feelings in a formal union. That said, currently due to the difficulty of getting divorced, as well as other reasons, marriage can make it more difficult for people to get out of abusive relationships. \n\nI'm absolutely pro free-love, and I think that whatever that means for you, whatever ceremony you want to have, whatever legal or economic relationship you want to have with your partner(s) should be completely up to you. If that's marriage, go for it. If you want to wear rings to symbolise your commitment, sure. And if not that's completely fine too.\n\nThat said, I do think marriage is sometimes unnecessarily forced on to us. Obviously forced\/arranged\/underage (that's my one exception to free love) marriages aren't so great, but also the general social stigma that you ought to get married that are perpetuated, even by people who mean well and if they really thought about how it can foster unhealthy relationships would probably realise their mistake.\n\nAlso, the whole consumerism aspect of how if you *really* love them you need to have an extravagant wedding and buy a diamond ring etc, it's a really rather sickening idea that the only way you can show your love for someone is by buying them expensive stuff.\n\nBriefly returning to what I mentioned earlier about underage marriage, I would personally set the bar at 18 but I'd be willing to argue down to 16. Anyone who thinks it should be below 16 is a paedophile on my books. For consent on the other hand I quite like the Australian implementation, that is, 16+ for general consent but it's also valid between people who are both (all) in the range of 14-16 (I think those are the right numbers but it varies between states). Personally I would set the bracket more like 14-18, but with both\/all participants needing to be within 2 years of each other, so e.g. a 15 and 17 year old can have consensual sex but if a 14 and 18 year old had sex it would be considered rape by the 18 year old. And then above 18 there aren't any restrictions as long as it's consenual. I think this balances the news to protect minors, but also allowing a healthy amount of sexual exploration. \n\nI went a bit off topic there at the end but that's my opinion on marriage.","created_utc":1537910472,"score":10,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Each of these men also faced a different political situation where murder, to say nothing of mass murder, may be not be the best tool for the job. Finally, both Putin and Trump are still in the process of writing their history's written whereas Hitler's finished. Hitler in 1935 was still only considered \"controversial\" in most circles, and his death toll was relatively minimal. Most foreign leaders still treated his government as legitimate and his overtures toward peace as credible. If you had said then, as a few did, that mass murder and war were soon to follow you'd have generally been dismissed as an alarmist and not altogether unfairly.\n\nWe are situated in the middle of one history and should not make the mistake of comparing its sums to those of histories that are already finished except with the ongoing character of the present at the forefront of our minds.","created_utc":1537928164,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Like, this genius' hypothesis literally puts *all of the blame for all wrong-doing on women*. \n\nHe says that any man who does wrong\/evil (or in his words IIRC \"is an asshole\") does it *because his mother had sex with an asshole*, presumably passing on the assholeness from the father. So if a man does wrong, it's his mother's fault. If that bad man raises their kid to be a piece of shit, it's their wife\/girlfriend's fault for having sex with them despite them being bad. He literally says that if women \"weren't attracted to [bad men],\" then *bad men would be bred out of existence within a generation*. \n\nOf course this idea is, on its face, insane on a million levels and I don't feel like writing an essay rebutting it at this moment, but I think it's pretty self-evident why it's f*cking insane and blatantly misogynistic, essentially saying men can't be blamed for anything because it all goes back to a kind of genetic original sin in which every generation of women plays the role of Eve. And it's obvious how this plays directly into incel\/red-piller ideology about how women are attracted to bad boys and that's why all the hard-right misogynistic \"nice guys\" get rejected. \n\nI wrote out a thorough rebuttal in a YouTube comment on this subject with what I thought were great points, but I can't easily find it to copy\/paste here.

{"author":"karnathe","body":"In the nineteenth century, the march of progress made it possible for the first time for human science to contemplate and comprehend those phenomena which had long seemed to contravene the laws of nature. Within a matter of decades, concepts that had long been viewed as witchcraft or sorcery were laid bare in the terms of a new and secret science, and governments and organizations around the world began to classify, study, and collect all such anomalies. And, just as artists throughout history have turned a critical eye to the events of the day in their work, so too did the artists of this scientific Renaissance begin to interpret these new discoveries on canvas.\n\nBy the 1870s, Paris was the center of the world of anomalous art, and the city stood witness to endless debates about the role of the anomalous in art, or whether such a role existed at all. When in 1874 the famed Salon des Magnifiques refused to allow any \"works of a phantasmagorical nature\" to be displayed at their grand exhibition, those artists shut out by the committee organized their own counter-exhibition, to be held at the same time across the river. \"Sommes-Nous Devenus Magnifiques?\", as the show came to be called, was the talk of the Parisian press for months, earning equal amounts of curiosity, dismissal, and outright derision, but the exiled gadflies had made their point - the paranormal, the anomalous, and the bizarre had found a place in the world of art and would not be so easily gotten rid of.\n\n\"Sommes-Nous Devenus Magnifiques?\" held its exhibitions every ten years thereafter, and as time passed the world of anomalous art grew larger. From its beginnings in Paris, artists from all across France and Europe, and later from the Americas and the Orient as well, began attending the increasingly prestigious - and increasingly bizarre and difficult to keep hidden from the disdainful eyes of a concerned government - exhibition, expressing new and different interpretations of the role of the anomalous in human life. It was at the sixth decennial exhibition in 1924 that the growing rift between the two largest schools of thought - logical vs. emotional, science vs. faith, Old World vs. New - came to a head, for it was at that show that for the first time, the works of the French surrealist Marcel Duchamp would be exhibited alongside those of Ruiz Marcos, the Mexican artist whose themes of magical realism and religious awe intertwined with the viscerally accessible Forteana of our world had set art critics worldwide at war with each other.\n\nThose who saw the two during the days leading up to the opening of the exhibition said they spent nearly the entire time in heated discussion with one another (in English, for neither spoke the other's mother tongue confidently) about everything under the Sun - the importance of the artist in relation to his work, the importance of context, faith, knowledge, law, free will, God, the State, democracy, Marxism, the war, the League of Nations, and the best way to serve a cup of coffee. It seemed that they might continue bickering throughout the entire exhibition, but as the artists prepared to greet the assembled press on the morning of its grand opening, they appeared to have finally come to an understanding.\n\nIf there is one image that comes to the mind of any art historian when the 1924 Expo is brought up, it is of that iconic photo of Duchamp and Ruiz posing side by side with their fellow artists in front of the still-closed doors, Marcos seemingly leaning over to whisper something into Duchamp's ear. For decades, many have speculated on what words Marcos had for his colleague during that memorable instant; a question of metaphysics? Or a challenge? An affirmation of their coming to terms? A reminder of the reason why they were there at that moment of time? Perhaps an expression of amazement at the multitudes that had come to see them? According to one reporter who claimed he stood close enough to overhear that whisper amidst the din of the crowd, it was all five at once, expressed in four simple words;\n\n\"Are we cool yet?\"\n\n- Excerpt from The Coolest War: Memories of a Critic, by Anonymous","created_utc":1537969534,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I have in mind the parts of each book related to the characters having experiences where they are able to transcend the confines of pervasive social norms and constructs, and to have a more raw and visceral connection to life and the people around them. Now, this is certainly not explicitly anarchist, but I would say that valuing such experiences is an important part of the impetus for Tolstoy's critique of the norms and structures that have to be transcended in order to have such experiences -- i.e. that his anarchism is motivated by a critique of the ways in which society gets in the way of people cultivating a life based on such experiences.

However I think it's a more potent take on it than most, and it approaches the issue from a radical angle. The point the novel makes rather succinctly (and in no light terms) is that living for the individual amounts to nothing, and genuine living comes from compassion for the whole\/community\/humanity and as Tolstoy would likely have it, the holy spirit (being realized in the community rather than \"God\").\n\nI enjoyed it. In typical Russian fashion, it takes a heavy subject and turns it into a more heady disconnected read (which I think makes it easier to digest). It's a short read too. It reads like a cautionary tale rather than a dramatized glorification of Ilych's suffering, that said it does take itself seriously in balancing a certain lament for the individual (which is rounded out best by Ilych's own critical feelings). \n\n","created_utc":1537982432,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"tpedes","body":"Are you talking about far leftists and anarchists mostly IRL or mostly places like here? Because here I'm constantly reminded of (to date myself) a favorite *Peanuts* cartoon from my childhood: Lucy proclaiming, \"I love mankind. It's people I can't stand!\" \n\nI do think that at least some of what's going on with the wokeness sweepstakes is that it's really not all that challenging to participate. If you're in a group that's been shit upon, which almost everyone is, you know how good it feels to openly fight back when someone says something that's congruent with the way you've been shit on. Once you identify that, then it's not hard to learn all of the things to look for in order to identify other people being shit on and what jargon to use. \n\nThat's a good thing in many ways, but if what is being identified are personal feeling and personal interactions (which is how most in the U.S., at least, are taught to understand \"racism\") rather than structural* elements that ensure the perpetuation of racism, sexism, and the like, then it really can start to seem like an endless round of finger-pointing and onewokesmanship. I definitely agree that intersectional theory and not using oppressive language are critical, but I also agree that being here often feels like stumbling through a game of gotcha.\n\nBut, what are you going to do? Some, maybe many, of us don't have even leftists around us to bounce ideas off, talk with about what we're doing and how we're working through things, and rant to about the latest outrage. This is what we've got. \n\nOh, and I do think that veganism (taken broadly) can have a whole shit-ton of problems, but I don't know that I've seen the discussion be shut down here. I seem to remember that the last time it came up, posts were in the three digits (although many of those were me being an argumentative asshole).\n\n-----\n\\* Hell, superstructural, to not beat around that particular bush.","created_utc":1538009325,"score":3,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}
{"author":"siberianmachine","body":"I've seen it as a common criticism of the left that a lot of people are quick to call others they disagree with racists, transphobes, homophobes, etc. and spend zero time attempting to educate people and that really doesn't help bring anyone to the left. If anything, it further solidifies people's opposition to left politics. I'm not saying we should be completely tolerant of people's actions, however like most of us, we probably had a point in life where we believed differently than we do now. It's about helping people change the way they see the world, how they see each other and how we relate. I like to use the quote from Huey Newton,\n\n\"I dissuade Party members from putting down people who do not understand. Even people who are unenlightened and seemingly bourgeois should be answered in a polite way. Things should be explained to them as fully as possible. I was turned off by a person who did not want to talk to me because I was not important enough. Maurice just wanted to preach to the converted, who already agreed with him. I try to be cordial, because that way you win people over. You cannot win them over by drawing the line of demarcation, saying you are on this side and I am on the other; that shows a lack of consciousness. After the Black Panther Party was formed, I nearly fell into this error. I could not understand why people were blind to what I saw so clearly. Then I realized that their understanding had to be developed.\"\n\nNow I believe Newton was coming from maybe a more general class consciousness viewpoint, but we should remember that we are all *constantly* exposed to propaganda that is transphobic, homophobic, racist and sexist. We realize this, but others do not and I think should strive to educate people who may not have a level of \"consciousness\" yet as well as just adhere to a general \"pick your battles\" mindset. It's not worth getting into an argument on Facebook with someone over the word \"dumb\" and accusing them of ableism and shutting down any real dialogue. \n\nAnyways, I think the point I was trying to make was that leftists should be willing to talk and educate people *before* we jump to labeling people any kind of phobic. Some people such as I have grown up in a conservative Christian household which almost never encourage any kind of critical theory or general questioning of social norms. Every situation is different so I'm not saying that people should just put up with some guy on the internet that is mansplaining another person or being generally disrespectful. I guess it just takes gauging the situation and the person. That's my thoughts and I'd like to here what other people have to say too if anyone would like to add to that.","created_utc":1538009627,"score":8,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"kyoopy246","body":"I guess I could answer that legal heirarchy is not the only form of oppression that exists in this universe. I could point out the obscenely high homicide rates of trans or non-binary individuals, or systematic bullying that occurs with young non-conforming individuals. Or denial of healthcare to people with the very real medical need to transition, at the risk of severe psychological or physical harm. Or maybe the risk that young non-conforming people face in their families and coming out - being abused or disowned.\n\nBut really I think the more compelling argument is that all members of society are in some way oppressed by this system of strict gender and sexuality groupings. Theorhetically everybody has some form of ideal self, a combination of physical, sexual, emotional, romantic, behavioral, and other characteristics. By coding groups of those traits into masculine and feminine and explicitly and implicitly enforcing the catagories you place pressure on people to align with their predescribed group of traits instead of their theorhetical ideals. This can manifest in tiny ways like a man being embarrassed to have long hair or in devestating ways like a person who views themselves as straight acting out in violence against a trans-partner out of perceived dissonance in how they are pressured to act by their societal structure versus how they feel. A massive breadth of beneficial human experience is denied to most people by these categories.\n\nSo yeah, I would consider that a sort of heirarchy.

{"author":"humanispherian","body":"How far along in the book are you? Some sections are definitely much more of a challenge than others. \n\nThe essential parts of the work are Chapters 1\u20133 and 5. The biographical introduction by Langlois was actually lifted from the *Correspondence*, but it is useful to get a bit of an overview of Proudhon's career. The Preface has some important bits in it, but it also introduces a few possible confusions. \n\nChapter 1 is important because it sets up the provocation\u2014*Property is theft*\u2014and includes the important\u2014and rather Stirner-like\u2014discussion of fixed ideas. In the process of setting up the next couple of chapters it also introduces the beginnings of Proudhon's anarchist critique of authority and established his primary keyword\u2014*justice*\u2014in a central place in the argument. \n\nChapter 2 dispenses with the notion of property as a natural right and demonstrates that mere occupation does not grant the rights presently associated with property. We get a tour of some of the sillier justifications capitalists bring to defend private property. And we get a distinction between *simple property* and *simple possession* that is perhaps not fully clarified\u2014and Proudhon even claimed late in his life that he had left possession *undefined*, although that's probably an overstatement\u2014but does provide us with a fairly distinct alternative to the status quo. The chapter ends with a critique of the claim that law can create property. \n\nChapter 3 is absolutely full of interesting arguments and clever turns of phrase, but it has to be treated as one continues argument, with premises being granted in one section for the sake of argument and then refuted in subsequent sections. Always keep in mind his summary of Chapters 2 and 3: \"The first of these chapters will prove that the right of occupation *obstructs* property; the second that the right of labor *destroys* it.\" And if he seems to be granting an argument that suggests that labor *creates* property, you can be well prepared when the next phase of the argument digs away at even more of the rationales for property. There is a lot in the chapter, both regarding property and anarchy, but the essential thing to understand is the function of *collective force* and the alleged *right of increase* in shaping the distribution of the fruits of industry. This is Proudhon's theory of exploitation and it is not only the heart of his critique of capitalism but also the heart of his critique of governmentalism. (If you want a simple preview, check out the first post linked in my series on [Proudhon's social science](https:\/\/www.libertarian-labyrinth.org\/project-proudhons-social-science\/).) \n\nChapter 4 was the part of the book that Proudhon was apparently most proud of, since it shows \"mathematically\" just how absurd the claims of property are, but I think most people find it harder going than the rest, at least at first. If it's a problem, then skip to Chapter 5. \n\nChapter 5 is a bit of a departure, in that it is much less about property than about Proudhon's theory of social development and provides an introduction to his anarchist thought. Treat it like a sneak preview of much of what he will write over the following 25 years and pay particular attention to the final section on \"the third form of society.\" \n\nAnd if you want a bit of commentary on the likely connections between that last chapter and his later work, you might take a look at my short essay, \"[How does property become anarchist?](https:\/\/www.libertarian-labyrinth.org\/featured-articles\/how-does-property-become-anarchist\/)\"","created_utc":1538078112,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Sihplak","body":"&gt;ive done the research myself, it did surprise me that i couldnt find any strong evidence that holodomor was some kind of systematic deliberate mass murder, but really how does this change much?\n\nUh, because that's the entire claim? \"I didn't find evidence supporting the idea that the USSR committed genocide, but how does that change the fact that the USSR committed genocide\"? That's a bit of an asinine statement if you ask me.\n\n&gt;there isnt any empirical evidence that it wasn't deliberate either.\n\nOf course there isn't evidence of it not being deliberate; you can't ask someone to prove a negative. You can just say \"prove you didn't murder this person\", \"prove that you didn't rob Bob last thursday\", etc. It's always the accuser whom has the burden of proof. You're literally resorting to your imagination as a part of your argument.\n\n&gt;some of them deny the intentionality... others deny that it was even the fault of the soviet government (it clearly was, no doubt)\n\nYou say without providing any evidence? We can reference [Davies and Wheatcroft](http:\/\/gen.lib.rus.ec\/book\/index.php?md5=32DAA2871728468189A57E0233492A3A), who demonstrate that, perhaps bad policy decisions exacerbated the famine, but didn't cause it, as largely the famine was caused by wheat rust, drought, pests, generally poor weather, a decline in amount of farm animals and similar farming utilities, and poor soil for farming. We also see in [Mark Tauger's](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B-eTgjCs2lzpNExnSEVhMjBLRlE\/view) look into the 1932-33 famine, that most human actions that affected the famine were not only not uniform, but largely were not caused by the Soviet government, but was a reaction against collectivization, largely stemming from landlords. Of course, the actions of kulaks, and similarly, delukalization did have some effect on the famine, it overall was found to be much lesser compared to most other elements. Furthermore, [Douglas Tottle's](http:\/\/www.rationalrevolution.net\/special\/library\/tottlefraud.pdf) examination of the famine found that a large amount of reporting on the famine had been fabricated, with many images being altered from earlier famines in similar regions and with the majority of claims about the famine and causes of the famine originating in Nazi Germany and Nazi-sympathetic American newspapers (more information on this [in this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QzXFXdOz_8Q&amp;t=6s) going over the topic in a more easily digestible manner).\n\n&gt;and others still fully deny that there was even any famine in the ukraine whatsoever and that the whole thing was fabricated!\n\nI've never seen anyone make this claim, and no credible historian ever has.\n\n&gt;is calling them genocide apologists fair? sure there is room for debate here. is calling them holodomor deniers fair? yup. you wanna go up to some old ukranian people and tell them that the whole thing was made up when they actually lived through it?\n\nThe funny thing is, is that you say all of this presuming that Ukraine went through a targetted famine. If this were the case, how come, as also demonstrated by the above texts, Ukraine wasn't affected nearly as badly as Kazakhstan and similar regions? If the USSR for some reason wanted to create a famine to target Ukrainians, you'd think they'd limit it specifically to that region so as not to affect, you know, infrastructure, labor capacity, and so on that are critical to a nation. Along with this, Douglas Tottle's book above was made with assistance by, as you put it, \"some old Ukrainian people... [that] actually lived through it\".\n\n&gt;who cares, it doesnt excuse all the actual intentional killing done by the USSR and china etc. also the systematic killing of anarchists hello?\n\nIf you're talking about the conflict between the black army and red army, I'd reference [this polemic written by another user](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/communism\/comments\/64wkgf\/polemic_the_anarchokulak_bandits_of_russia_and\/) demonstrating the monstrous nature of Makhno and the black army. If you're talking about Kronstadt, you can find a basic ML take on it [in this thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/communism101\/comments\/8ryrdb\/what_are_mls_opinions_on_the_kronstadt_rebellion\/). If you're talking about something else then I don't know precisely what you're referencing and would appreciate some kind of actual source.\n\n&gt;anyway it doesnt matter, my point is that they are basically unironically advocating for a dystopian horror movie and we're advocating for a utopian pipe dream. a decent criticism of anarchism is that we wont be able to achieve our goals. a decent criticism of full communists is that they might be able to achieve their goals.\n\nIt seems quite a bit like you're making claims without any backing to them. Feel free to go to \/r\/DebateCommunism if you want to debate about the USSR, PRC, and so on. Being honest however, nothing advocated for by MLs is \"dystopian\"; no ML wants the USSR was it was in the 1930s brought back in the modern day -- that'd be horrible and backwards because that was the state of the USSR at the time period, in terms of technology, economy, civil rights, and so on. The point being made is that historical inaccuracy doesn't help anyone in any way. It is better to be historically literate so that one can understand why things are the way they are, how things occurred, and what the actual contexts for historical events were.","created_utc":1538089194,"score":8,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

Did Charlottesville terrorize people? Yes, but using the word \"terrorist\" reinforces an existing narrative - that the security state is the one that should protect us from such attacks, thus deserving all the absurd funding and power it has. Its only use here is empty shock value.\n\nSecond, when most people speak of the \"Charlottesville ... attack,\" they mean the car-ramming attack, which was done by a lone wolf. Yes, of course, the ideology of the lone wolf was shared by many of the attendees, the rally enabled him, and the right-wing in general didn't do much to condemn it, but they marches by the Neo-Nazis and co. were still meaningfully separate from the physical attack. The car attack wasn't coordinated with anyone, as far as we know, so the most obvious interpretation of the title makes it factually wrong.\n\nThird, the Charlottesville rally wasn't literally \"planned\" on reddit - it was planned by a whole bunch of far-right groups with regular members.

{"author":"TeeVeeLobotomy","body":"Theory yes, but old Karl lived through the experiment. Additionally Communism is not socialism.\n\n&gt; The methods of dictatorship in general and of the Five Year Plan in particular do not constitute the road to Socialism, but rather the road away from it.\n\n&gt;Certainly, it is the aim of Socialists to deprive the capitalists of the means of production. But that in itself is not enough. We must also determine who is to control these means of production. When another minority takes the place of the capitalists and controls the means of production, independently of the people and frequently against their will, the change in property relations thus accomplished signifies least of all Socialism. There are forms of Oriental despotism in which the master of the state wield also mastery over the country\u2019s instruments of production. [2] In comparison with this form of state economy, the capitalist system of production is much less oppressive, and resistance to it much more promising of results. In Russia it is the government, not the people, who controls the means of production. The government is thus the master of the people.\n\n&gt;The Socialism toward which Social Democracy is striving is a mode of production superior to capitalism. But the latter constitutes the highest of all modes of production yet developed: large industries with free workers who as yet have no authority over their means of production. Collective ownership and management of large enterprises with fullest freedom for the workers is Socialism, which is superior to industrial capitalism. But this capitalism is superior not only to the small industry of the guild craftsman, but also to large industry with compulsory labor, as well as to every form of state economy based upon conscript labor. Every economy of this sort must be rejected in spite of the fact that it is not capitalist. I do not agree with Max Adler who, arguing against me, once said that \u201cfor a Marxist the duty to participate in and sympathize with every movement against capitalism is a moral axiom.\u201d\n\n&gt;Our duty is not merely to abolish the capitalist order but to set up a higher order in its place. But we must oppose those forces aiming to destroy capitalism only to replace it with a barbarous mode of production.\n\n&gt;It is for this reason that the democratically-minded portion of the working class must oppose all tendencies toward dictatorship threatening the freedom of the workers, tendencies manifested not only by the capitalists but also those that originate with anti-capitalist groups.\n\nCommunism is no longer a theory.

Good history lesson and made a few points i hadnt thought of, as i definitely never heard about the shelters they have set up. A few things though:\n1- The whole fascist rebranding argument can be applied to antifa, as they would fit the description of fascists shown in the first 20 minutes by a few points. Violent opposition to opposing opinions, humiliation and claims to victimhood, etc.\n2- It is an understatement to say they realize \u201csome\u201d mistakes will be made, there are a lot. Pro-gun rallies are protested. Free speech rallies are not some veil for white supremacists, to say so is no different from the whole jewish\/globalist conspiracy theory. They have protested Ben Shapiro (major target of alt right for being jewish) and had him shut down due to rioting.\n3- Police and state sanctioned violence is blown out of proportion. Of course there are corrupt pigs out there, but the ones that come to these protests show force if they are threatened or if the protest doesn\u2019t disperse after getting to aggressive. In a way this violence is more justifiable because there is training and a process going into the police force while anyone can become an antifa actor anytime and do whatever they want with no scrutiny from other actors.\n4- History is an important teacher and philosophy time\u2019s incorporation of it into the video was necessary, but to say people of mixed race being know as whatever part of their racial heritage that isnt white being detrimental in some way, im sorry, but hes wrong, that IS a slippery slope fallacy. We as a people have evolved far past the point of early 60\u2019s and before America.\n5- As im sure he isnt biased, this video was meant to focus on antifa and nothing else, one major factor for the rise of the alt right isnt given enough attention by the left. The alt left is real. Whites are persecuted for being white, maybe not on the scale as some minorities have been, but its there and its more prevalent than ever. Affirmative action prioritizes some races over others. Scholarships for certain races regardless of individual backgrounds. The alt right has fed off of this fear.

The whole point of these videos is not to submit my ideas as in any way \"a standard,\" but rather to start conversations and productive ideation about what an anarchist society could look like.  \n\n\nAll that said, I read the article you linked to and saw a lot of refutation and criticism but nothing in the way of better ideas. I knew when I was writing the script that some people would interpret my ideas about a \"special circumstances hospital\" for people who are violent and predatory as just a renamed prison, and who would see my \"emergency response teams\" and \"social workers\" as just redubbed police officers. I can see where that interpretation stems from but I do believe it's a bad faith interpretation, since in my mind these institutions would have a fundamentally different methodology and framework than state-society prisons and police.  \n\n\nNow, if someone wants to argue that such systems are unworkable or impossible to build without inadvertent hierarchies, I can accept and consider such an argument, but I would like to know how society could deal with people like sexual predators or domestic abusers (as examples) without some form of seclusion from society (and their victims) and enforced counseling and treatment. I see in the article that the author refers vaguely to other writings but I don't know what writings they're referring to and I don't see that kind of refutation as particularly constructive.  \n\n\nIn short, the article you linked to seems to be a bad faith argument at best, and competitively cultivated identity at worst, since so much effort is put into demeaning whoever \"Scott\" is up to and including ad hominem attacks.  \n\n\nI see that this author is an indvidualist anarchist, and my stance on individualism is that it would work just fine for someone who wants to build a frontier farmstead or something where they live in seclusion, but when we choose to live in populated areas like cities where there might be many thousands of people crammed into a square mile there must be order and organization, lest the most vulnerable fall victim to \"tyranny of structurelessness\" which allows invisible hierachies to be formed.  \n\n\nAs Jo Freeman puts it:  \n\n\n\"This apparent lack of structure too often disguised an informal, unacknowledged and unaccountable leadership that was all the more pernicious because its very existence was denied.\"  \n\n\nAnyway, I do welcome this feedback, I just hope there can be a little more substance than calling these ideas \"crap\" and an article that's tearing down another article that's almost a decade old without much else in the way of context or constructive alternatives.","created_utc":1538165870,"score":9,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

IDK. I'm more than happy to listen to what others have to say and I'm not afraid of a negative reaction but I just feel like I'm missing something.

I'm not trying to say that he is or he isn't, because I genuinely don't know. And I feel like because I genuinely don't know, it's wrong to condemn him. But I feel like among the radfems especially, this would be seen as basically defending him. I definitely don't want to do that if he is guilty, but in the mean time... IDK.

It's the same reason that sociologists and political scientists and economists might be lumped together, and which the mathematicians might share space with computer scientists or theoretical physicists.

The party in control of the senate are the Republicans, who are somehow worse than the centrist, neolibral Democrats by virtue of being *extra* reactionary. Their majority is slim, though: 47 democrats vs 51 republicans, with 2 independents. That means that, for their darling nominee to be pushed through, they must hold-fast and remain together on this issue. Should the independents oppose Kavanaugh, and should the Democrats all vote no, then 2 Republicans must be swayed into saying no as well for his nomination to be rejected. \n\nInterestingly enough, Republicans are feeling political pressure. At a glance, none of their members have any reason to vote no next week. This is where my point resides. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf the right wing neo-facists feel pressured by feminism in the US, even with a majority, than that would mean that we have at least made some improvement through popular feminism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for his guilt, I don't think it actually matters to us.

{"author":"DreadSkeleton","body":"Even putting aside the relevance of the patriarchy, there's several reasons to care about this sort of thing as an anarchist.\n\n1.  It's not entirely kabuki theater.  It *does* represent a genuine dispute between different members of the elite grappling for power.  Such disputes between the elites often end up wasting their power or providing openings for Anarchist organizing.  Kavanaugh going down in flames would provide a way to make an argument that the people in charge are disorganized and incompetent.  Kavanaugh getting confirmed would provide a way to make an argument against his own awfulness.\n\n2.  Because it is *real* in that sense (ie. elites grapping for power) and does have genuine implications for people, ignoring it completely risks making it harder for us to recruit and convince people, because our arguments will seem out-of-touch with what they're concerned about.  \"Kavanaugh sucks and here's how that shows that the entire system is terrible\" is more effective as an argument than \"Kavanaugh doesn't matter, it's all just kabuki theater to manipulate sheeple like you.\"  Especially since, well, it does matter.  The reality of oligarchy is that struggles between groups of oligarchs can have dramatic implications for everyone else.\n\n3.  More generally, the broader world political situation is the context in which we're going to have to push for change.  Even when it *is* kabuki theater (and while some effects are very real, there's obviously a lot of theater to this, too), we need to pay attention to it and think about how it relates to our beliefs, because that's what most people in the country are going to hear.  I mean, I don't begrudge anyone who's just \"fuck all that\" and disconnecting from it, but I think it's advantageous to know what most people in this country are seeing and what's currently getting them moving.  The emotional and cultural buttons the elites push to mobilize people for those disputes have actual meaning and impact, too, in a way that provides insight into both our plutocracy and our broader culture in a way that's useful and interesting to anarchists.  \"Look how the elites mobilize in defense of patriarchy\" or \"look how the elites use patriarchy to mobilize people in support of their own power\" are interesting observations, even if this is just one example of something we're all probably very familiar with.\n\n4.  Since it saturates our media and hangs over all discussions of society and culture, anarchists often just want a chance to discuss these sorts of events from an anarchist perspective.  Even if it's just dismissing it as kabuki theater or the like, it is reassuring to discuss it with like-minded people and can help us refine our own beliefs, especially when we're surrounded by people who buy into party politics in real life.  Even just hearing people say \"yeah, that's mostly kabuki theater BS\" (or having the chance to say it) is cathartic.  Taking something like this (that is so loud that it is almost impossible to ignore) and saying \"let's discuss it from an anarchist perspective\" is useful in terms of buttressing our own beliefs.","created_utc":1538187484,"score":11,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

While I don't love everything Scott says, I think he does a good job of showing how anarchism isn't so \"out there\" and that it's very present in our lives in many ways.\n\nAs others have said, introducing concepts like co ops and collectives is good. I like to take what I know about someone and appeal to the anarchist in them. For example, if they are liberal and really upset about how we treat migrant families, explain how the state itself needs borders, and that is merely \"business as usual\" for the state. If they think it's wrong to deny immigrants from coming here, they can maybe see how borders themselves are wrong.\n\nI have conservative family, and I bring up the countryside (which they know) a lot, and that works well. People in rural areas don't rely on the state, they rely on their neighbors. This community aspect of \"you help me build a fence, I'll fix your car\" is more or less anarchism in action. Similarly, the community aspect of religion often involves helping out your neighbor. \n\nIt's honestly really hard though, the best is if they are willing to read, and if you can get them to participate in \"anarchism\" in some way. I have friends who always felt anarchism was out there, but changed their tune after working with refugees in Greece.

Also, Supreme Court justices are always questioned and put through the ringer and their pasts are routinely brought up and interrogated, because it is a matter of questioning the character of someone with a *life appointment* who is virtually unimpeachable, regardless of what they do while on the bench (there are more examples than just Clarence Thomas). This really only seems like a fiasco, in my opinion, because he was an awful, flawed, extreme partisan choice in the first place, who has a more outstanding allegation about him than most nominees.","created_utc":1538198058,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

The beating nearly killed Sumner and it drew a sharply polarized response from the American public on the subject of the expansion of slavery in the United States.

{"author":"hosikuzu","body":"I've noticed that even many anarchists who promote the idea of \"thinking small\" tend to fall into the trap of thinking big when they comment on history.\n\nI think that if you're going to be anti-state, then your view of history also shouldn't be one that aggrandizes (for good or for ill) state actors to the detriment of individuals and movements and moments.\n\nI always find myself apologizing for the history of communism, not because I think \"Stalin did nothing wrong\" (he did lots of things wrong), but because I think casting the whole thing as evil and a failure ignores all of the people who believed that a better world was possible and were working to create it as best they could.\n\nThere's this idea, a very liberal one I think, that just sort of assumes that states, that governments, that leaders, act according to the will of their subjects. And the lifestylists and individualists too (who also draw on some of the worst aspects of liberal ideology) assume shit like, well they must have supported it because they didn't drop out of society or rebel, or whatever shit goes on in their minds I don't even fucking know. I think as anarchists we should be bright enough to know that that's not true, that the interests of the state are the interests of the ruling class, and that those interests are almost always opposed to the interests of the people. Like, ask anyone who's ever lived under the rule of a state. But for some reason people seem to forget this when looking back at history.\n\nOne thing I absolutely hate is when tankies throw out, \"You're just repeating racist stereotypes about asians when you call the Chinese government or the North Korean government authoritarian.\" No, because we're not claiming that they actually chose to live under those governments, you fucksticks.\n\nDon't play that game, don't conflate states with people.\n\nSorry I think I got a little off-focus there.","created_utc":1538225442,"score":7,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

I\u2019m going to tell you what I really think of Donald Trump. This man is a pathological liar. He doesn\u2019t know the difference between truth and lies. He lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth. And, in a pattern that I think is straight out of a psychology textbook, his response is to accuse everybody else of lying.\n\nHe accuses everybody on that debate stage of lying, and it\u2019s simply a mindless yell. Whatever he does, he accuses everyone else of doing.\n\nThe man cannot tell the truth, but he combines it with being a narcissist. A narcissist at a level \u2013 I don\u2019t think this country\u2019s ever seen. Donald Trump is such a narcissist that Barack Obama looks at him and goes, \u201cDude, what\u2019s your problem?\u201d Everything in Donald\u2019s world is about Donald.\n\nAnd he combines being a pathological liar\u2026 and I say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon, and one thing in the evening, all contradictory, and he\u2019d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he\u2019s telling at that minute, he believes it.\n\nBut the man is utterly amoral. [Reporter starts a question] Let, let me finish this, please. The man is utterly amoral. Morality does not exist for him. It\u2019s why he went after Heidi directly and smeared my wife. Attacked her. Apparently she\u2019s not pretty enough for Donald Trump. I may be biased but I think if he\u2019s making that allegation, he\u2019s also legally blind.\n\nBut Donald is a bully. You know, we just visited with fifth graders. Every one of us knew bullies in elementary school. Bullies don\u2019t come from strength, bullies come from weakness. Bullies come from a deep, yawning cavern of insecurity. There is a reason Donald builds giant buildings and puts his name on them everywhere he goes.\n\nAnd I will say, there are millions of people in this country who are angry. They\u2019re angry at Washington, they\u2019re angry at politicians who have lied to them, I understand that anger. I share that anger. And Donald is cynically exploiting that anger, and he is lying to his supporters.\n\nDonald will betray his supporters on every issue. If you care about immigration, Donald is laughing at you. And he\u2019s telling the moneyed elites that he doesn\u2019t believe what he\u2019s saying, he\u2019s not gonna build a wall \u2013 that\u2019s what he told the New York Times, he will betray you on every issue across the board.\"\n","created_utc":1538244977,"score":6,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

It also creates a situation where corporations are incentivizes to seek external tax havens for out-of-state instead of bringing money back, possibly even moving their base of operations out entirely. Instead, by taxing individual income, on a sliding scale(perhaps $10m+ income is taxed at 95%), corporations are incentivized to deploy their capital locally to labor, especially at the lower end where it\u2019s most beneficial to individuals.\n\nBy disentangling corporate profits from taxes, you create a situation where states want individuals personal income to be maximized, may actually support unions, etc.\n\nI mentioned corporations should be blocked from lobbying, or funding political actions whatsoever.\n\nAnother route would be to block private corporations to exist at all, and all production in managed by the state.

I studied sociology and still have no clue as to how to help bring about the right circumstances to elicit it or convert people to believing in a mutually beneficial, mutually benevolent ethos.\n\nI think we have done the important work of clarifying the terms, to an extent. There is definitely a gray area between where anger ends and hatred picks up, for me, if we agree I'm referring to the generalized term, and not the one usually invoked to describe *hate groups* and the like. In that sense, anger\/hate, I feel, is a natural and necessary human emotion, whether it be of things, ideas or people. I see it as fundamental to mankind's social existence. I think the problem may lie in our inability to develop a sophisticated system to vent anger, resolve grievances, and deal with it in a healthy, nonviolent, productive manner. This is where I would propose that, and it sounds like you may agree, anarchy (or perhaps other such similarly-minded, collectivist ideologies) could prove hugely beneficial.","created_utc":1538277454,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"hegelstan9000","body":"I'm always disappointed whenever I see a comment like this. They always regurgitate \"Great Man\" theories. No, Trotsky, Lenin, and Stalin were not the only members of the Politburo and no, individual leaders cannot \"ruin a revolution\". The proletariat makes up part of the totality that is capitalist social relations and its revolutionary activity is determined by the contradiction between itself and capital. Simply blaming the Bolsheviks overlooks this entirely. \n\nAlso, it's worth noting that being \"against the principles of egalitarianism\" isn't very groundbreaking for Marxists. Marxists have always focused on liberation rather than equality. Here's Engels in 1875 on the topic:\n\n\n&gt;\"The elimination of all social and political inequality,\u201d rather than \u201cthe abolition of all class distinctions,\u201d is similarly a most dubious expression. As between one country, one province and even one place and another, living conditions will always evince a certain inequality which may be reduced to a minimum but never wholly eliminated. The living conditions of Alpine dwellers will always be different from those of the plainsmen. The concept of a socialist society as a realm of equality is a one-sided French concept deriving from the old \u201cliberty, equality, fraternity,\u201d a concept which was justified in that, in its own time and place, it signified a phase of development, but which, like all the one-sided ideas of earlier socialist schools, ought now to be superseded, since they produce nothing but mental confusion, and more accurate ways of presenting the matter have been discovered.","created_utc":1538281047,"score":2,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Russian_Fuzz","body":"I think a big part of it is what Marxists think of what will happen to a state post-revolution. Marx theorised that the state would disintegrate as a result of class abolition through the proletariat. As has been pointed out by another comment, Anarchists (correctly) foresaw that this wouldn't be the case. As demonstrated with the Bolshevists uprising and other Soviet affiliated regimes, the way that power is concentrated inevitably leads to a new class of bourgeoisie; Bakunin predicted 'Red Bureaucracy' about 40 years before it happened. \n\nI think this is one of the reasons Anarchists often find it difficult to interface with Communists, because we've had the argument, we've shown our working, we've shown that in many cases, we're correct, yet many Communists still keep banging the drum of all of these cases being a case of communism done 'wrong'. \n\nI think other folks in this thread have mentioned the 'necessity' of a state whilst establishing stability. This temporary imbuing of power upon an individual or small group that aren't a direct mouthpiece of 'the people' has historically not been so temporary - once the state has power, it seems to have the effect of creating a kind of 'cult of statism', as you can see with Lenin and his Bolshevist poster boys. \n\nSo yeah, I think part of the reason we don't see much discussion is because a lot of anarchists are kind of sick of having that discussion, it's been had, we've made our minds up and are fed up of going in circles. It's not to say we shouldn't create a united front against issues we all agree and disagree on, but to start making headway as a unified group, it would be nice to see people reading more Bakunin and less Marx. Some of their own letters to one another in the late 1800's (around about 1870 I think) are really interesting to read.\n\nThere's also a really good debate on exactly this issue called 'The Poverty of Statism' that was initially produced in 1922 but reprinted in the 80's. It's a debate between Nikolai Bukharin, who was basically Lennin's no.2 until he was duped by that pesky Stalin; Luigi Fabbri, a relatively unpublished (in English) Italian anarchist; and Rudolf Rocker, an American anarchist philosopher with the greatest name in human history. It essentially takes the format of an open letter\/propaganda pamphlet written by Bukharin to refute anarchism\/promote communism and then gives you the responses of Fabbri (who is fucking hilarious and brutally sarcastic) and Rocker, who is a teeeeeny bit dry but really informative. Fabbri's section is a direct response clearly written in anger (which makes it really fucking entertaining) and Rocker's section is extracts from particularly relevant essays of his that have been picked by the publisher. You should be able to find a PDF of it online, but I'm in mobile so can't check. I've got a filthy second hand copy of it I found, so if anyone hasn't put it up online, let me know with a message and I'll take on the task when I can find a scanner. \n\nMany people might rightfully be pretty skeptical of taking arguments from something that was initially published in 1922, but it still really stands up, I'd suggest it. \n\nEdit: here it is! https:\/\/libcom.org\/library\/poverty-statism-anarchism-vs-marxism full download on the page.","created_utc":1538310241,"score":8,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"ApostleLeaks","body":"About your 2nd paragraph, how large are you talking when you say a \"major community\"? 1000? 1 million? 10 million? (You say city or a town in a Western country so I assume you mean tens or hundreds of thousands, and densely populated).\n\nI think anarchism would work best in one of two scenarios:\n\n\\- The entire planet lives under anarchism (so nation states are abolished, nobody has any military, no nuclear weapons, no insanely rich people, etc.). In this situation the most you'd get is low scale violence between two communities close together if one tries to steal from the other one, for example.\n\n\\- Anarchists live in small communities, have a happy, fulfilling life without having to participate in capitalism, and go undetected (e.g. living off-grid, not having bank accounts, etc.). In this case making a fuckton of noise is a terrible idea, although I appreciate it's very selfish not to show people they have this option for a happier life.\n\nIf there's 50 of us running a farm in a rural area and surviving happily, any Government is unlikely to care enough and will leave us alone. However, if there's an anarchist community of 300,000 people and they are making the news every day, and people are flocking to live with them, a Government (especially in a country like the US or Germany) WILL sabotage you, attack you, secretly poison your population, cut off your water supply, whatever. They're not going to just sit there and let a large chunk of the population avoid participating in capitalism, at least not successfully. And we'd be living in territory that they own (at least according to the current world order), so they would feel justified to stop us.\n\nBasically, we have the best chance of living under anarchism long-term if we do it in small groups in rural areas, relatively secretly OR we can somehow hope the entire world as we know it collapses and the entire world lives an anarchist lifestyle.\n\nYour idea of a city-sized anarchist community could work combined with weird kind of nationalism (in the current world order). However, I think most current anarchists wouldn't want to do that. It would require the anarchist community to:\n\n\\- Have strict borders (you'd probably have to all go on a rota to protect the edge of your territory, while armed, to prevent capitalists from entering your territory and taking over, which they WILL if you let them).\n\n\\- Declare independence (most of the world would still recognise it as part of the original country for a long time though, for example, if Catalonia declares independence the rest of the world will still consider it part of Spain until it's impossible not to anymore, however, the most important thing is that the people within the borders don't consider themselves under the jurisdiction of the previous country anymore).\n\n\\- Have a \"military\" (probably not in the same way that we're used to at the moment, but there'd have to be SOMETHING). This is the bit that's most important, and also that I think anarchists would most strongly object to. You might be able to protect yourself fairly well from land invasions with just a wall, and some guns, cannons, etc. The old-fashioned way. However, what about when the US conducts air-strikes on you because your community has taken 300,000 people from their population and is causing the rest of their population to revolt against the capitalist system after they've seen how great life is in the Anarchist City-State of North America? You'd need a way to protect yourself. Especially for defensive reasons, but also to make other countries not want to attack you in the first place. You need to show them you can do worse back to them if they attack you. A lot of people would say this doesn't count as anarchism, but if you want a town\/city-sized anarchist community and you want to make a big fuss and make sure everybody knows about you, you WILL be stopped\/wiped out\/whatever else, so for it to work in the long-term there needs to be a way to protect yourself and fight back.\n\nFrom what I've read having a town\/city sized anarchist community doesn't count as true anarchism anyway. True anarchism would consist of much smaller communities, living self-sufficiently and independently, helping other neighbouring communities out when needed.\n\nThere are other things as well, but I need to stop.","created_utc":1538331242,"score":5,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

But its okay to be anti civ and not be anprim like Emma Goldman for example who was an ancom but had critique of civilization back in her time when she was influenced by Nietzsche and Stirner. \n\nSometimes technology can build by making us be consumers, make us buy vehicles to get to work rather then trying to use it spent time with others   or follow laws based on technology itself making us like mechanics rather acting as humans. But other times they're technology that are ment to serve us rather then serve them like medical technology for example, as it has been use to help people who're in dire need. Indoor Farming is another good example that can be use to plant food that want and need to eat base on landscape that can't peovide agriculture. Even internet can help people sometimes that many people want knowledge. So yes while sonetime it can lead to comformism develop by the statist, conservatives and capitalist, it also has the potential to create individualism, creativity and diversity that many anarchist promote for a very long time \n\nSo the answer to your question is no not many will die. Rather we make sure to destory civilization and technology that control us and spare technology and science that serve us for a long time; that help the sick, the weak, the poor and the vulnerable, develop new forms of culture and philiosphies based on Stirnerite Egoism, Existentialism, Absudism or Nietzscheanism and form communes that's beyond primitive and civilization similar to Owen and Fourier philiosphy, but without classes still in tact, currency, mysticism, or any other things those two had in their thought at that time.","created_utc":1538332429,"score":1,"subreddit":"Anarchism"}

{"author":"Russian_Fuzz","body":"I think the point that many anarchists get tired of making is that under a well designed anarchist system, such as some of the ones in Spain, you can completely bypass the whole state thing. It's just not necessary and through very human flaws, like mental illness and incompetence, they can become corrupt and dysfunctional.\n\nAnarchism doesn't ever give one individual enough sway to corrupt an entire system, making much more sturdy as it's never at the mercy of one individual. Communism's past tenancy to assemble a cult mentality around a leader is all too unstable, to me it makes much more sense to stress policy as a faceless group as opposed to finding a representative who embodies the values of your cause or agenda. \n\nIf your goal is to create a system that can survive without the oppression of a state, which from my understanding is the 'end goal' of Marx's view of communism, then why establish a state at all? It makes much more sense to create a system of values as a collective which reflect the values of the people within that society, people can do that themselves.\n\nYou're totally correct that Lenin would have despised what the Soviet Union became, but it became that way due to flaws in how it imbued certain individuals with too much power, thus essentially creating a new hyper ironic bourgeoisie within its own ranks. Anarchism presents totally reasonable solutions to these problems. By placing policy at the forefront of a discussion as opposed to placing an individual, you're circumnavigating a lot of the issues that currently plague policy making, and will continue to plague policy making for as long as it has such a sharp focus on the individual.

It seems to me that while government does enforce some indirect consequences of not working\u2014getting caught up in the legal system, debt obligations, police harassing homeless people, etc.\u2014as well as creating demand for work through jobs programs, construction, and so on, it also assuages some of the hardships of choosing not to work through various forms of welfare (though of course means-testing and the welfare reforms of the 90s have made those more tenuous). Nevertheless, I think one could make the opposite claim, as I'm sure many anarcho-capitalists do, that government *disincentivizes* work by giving out free (\"free\") stuff.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm genuinely puzzled why an anarcho-capitalist would frame the question this way. Perhaps he's wondering how a communist society, which he imagines can only exist through central planning, could function without government.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo answer that question is well beyond my ability.

{"author":"vetch-a-sketch","body":"&gt;The general swing to the Right [in revolutionary Spain] dates from about October-November 1936, when the U.S.S.R. began to supply arms to the Government and power began to pass from the Anarchists to the Communists. Except Russia and Mexico no country had had the decency to come to the rescue of the Government, and Mexico, for obvious reasons, could not supply arms in large quantities. Consequently the Russians were in a position to dictate terms. There is very little doubt that these terms were, in substance, 'Prevent revolution or you get no weapons', and that the first move against the revolutionary elements, the expulsion of the P.O.U.M. from the Catalan Generalite, was done under orders from the U.S.S.R. [...] Once the U.S.S.R. had intervened the triumph of the Communist Party was assured. To begin with, gratitude to Russia for the arms and the fact that the Communist Party, especially since the arrival of the International Brigades, looked capable of winning the war, immensely raised the Communist prestige. Secondly, the Russian arms were supplied via the Communist Party and the parties allied to them, who saw to it that as few as possible got to their political opponents. Thirdly, by proclaiming a non-revolutionary policy the Communists were able to gather in all those whom the extremists had scared. It was easy, for instance, to rally the wealthier peasants against the collectivization policy of the Anarchists. There was an enormous growth in the membership of the party, and the influx was largely from the middle class--shopkeepers, officials, army officers, well-to-do peasants, etc., etc.\n\n-George Orwell, *Homage to Catalonia*\n\n_______\nEvery case of Leninism in the past -- U.S.S.R., P.R.C., Vietnam, Mongolia, Cuba, Korea, etc. -- has seen initial 'successes' reversed by the continuing exploitation of working people by what is, in effect, a new ruling class, followed by a gradual return to capitalism.
