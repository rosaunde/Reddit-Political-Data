How are you to prevent a person from amassing millions in China and then settling amongst you? How are you going to prevent such a one from surrounding himself with lackeys and wage-slaves \u2014 from exploiting them and enriching himself at their expense?\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cYou cannot bring about a revolution all over the world at the same time. Well, then, are you going to establish custom-houses on your frontiers to search all who enter your country and confiscate the money they bring with them? \u2014 Anarchist policemen firing on travellers would be a fine spectacle!\u201d\n\n&gt; But at the root of this argument there is a great error. Those who propound it have never paused to inquire whence come the fortunes of the rich. A little thought would, however, suffice to show them that these fortunes have their beginnings in the poverty of the poor. When there are no longer any destitute there will no longer be any rich to exploit them.\n\nbut uh\nthat\u2019s not really an answer\n\nIs he suggesting that the means of production be put to work to provide for everyone on earth simultaneously, alongside the political revolution and expropriation? A global commune, so to speak?  He hasn't yet elaborated on how that might be accomplished.  At the very least, you\u2019d need revolutionaries who own transportation for air, land, and sea, who can run blockades and smuggle all those goods into capitalist countries, to provide for everyone at once.

Seriously, don't read if you're not in an OK headspace. I'd rather the post get ignored than send someone into a spiral.**\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\n~\n\nSo I've been stewing over this all day and I need to get it *out.*\n\nI work at a place that helps kids who have been abused or aren't able to be homed by \"the system\" because of past abuse\/trauma manifesting in serious anti-social behavior (usually violence.) The kids we work with have seen the absolute worst that humanity has to offer, there are people who have quit the day they started because they read through the kids files and just nope'd straight out of there. \n\nThe pay is garbage. It's barely above minimum wage. We're expected to deal with kids who can and do attack people, several staff have been hospitalized after being sucker punched, it's happened several times where kids were caught planning a gang rape of a staff member (thankfully it was never carried out.) \n\nEven with all that going on, that isn't the worst part of this job. The absolute worst part of this job is talking to other people about it.\n\nIt's frustrating when people say some version of \"Oh well hopefully there's a good Christian family out there that is willing to take one of these kids in and give them a loving home.\"\n\nMother. Fucker.\n\nA lot of these kids are here because they've already gone through several \"good Christian families.\" Maybe they killed the family dog, maybe they beat their sibling so badly they had to be hospitalized, maybe they can't stop sexualizing their interactions with certain people. Whatever the reason, they're with us because they haven't technically done enough to get put in jail and are generally severely emotionally disturbed.\n\nWhat sails past frustrating and right smack into \"blood spraying out of the eyeballs infuriating\" is when any discussion of pay comes up. \n\nToday I was waiting in line and it was going to be a while so the woman behinds me strikes up a conversation. Just a basic \"Hey, we're gonna be here a while, let's pass the time by chit-chatting.\" I'm not a huge fan of small-talk but whatever I can people for a bit.\n\nWe meander around for a few minutes before discussing local minimum wage which is set to go up in the relatively near future with the ultimate goal of $15\/hr. She's expressing her displeasure that people without an education are demanding so much money and they should just be happy they have a job.\n\nMeanwhile I'm trying not to clench my teeth to the point of needing my molars surgically extracted from my ear and I point out that a lot of these jobs are a lot harder than they seem at first glance.\n\nI use my job as an example. On the surface it looks easy; clean up the center while the kids are asleep, if a kid wets or craps the bed clean it and them up, if someone has a nightmare calm them down. Simple, right?\n\nSo how do you calm down a six year old who can't stop having nightmares about their older brother who raped them from before they can remember? Like what do you *actually* say to a child who tells you that? \"It's ok, you're safe here, they can't come in here.\"\n\nTheir bed at home was supposed to be safe, until it wasn't.\n\nWhat do you do with a kid who can't stop wetting the bed or crapping in his underwear because that was how he learned to prevent being fondled and now he can't stop?\n\nShe gave me the look. It's a look I've become *very* familiar with and it says \"I know your job is hard, I'm glad you're doing it and not me.\" It's gratitude but gratitude more that *they* don't have to deal with it. She goes on to tell me that I'm a \"good person\" for doing what I do and that I'm \"doing god's work.\"\n\nMy molars are now actually being pressed out the back of my head now and I'm fairly certain I've sprained a muscle in my jaw from clenching my teeth so hard.\n\nI wanted to say something trite or just loose my cool and dress her down right there but I was just too angry to even talk. I just turned away and stared burn marks in the wall.\n\n\"Your job is hard, to the point where I couldn't do it, but you don't deserve to be paid appropriately for it.\"\n\nThat was the takeaway I got from that. I should be ok with kudos but, actual money? I didn't go to college and *most* of the job doesn't sound that hard so I really don't *deserve* more than a few cents over minimum wage.\n\nI think I'm just going to start telling people I'm a webcam model or an escort. I feel like it would be easier to deal with the reactions from that than constantly hearing that I'm \"doing god's work.\"\n\nGod's pay scale fucking sucks.\n\n\/rant.\n\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"[Rant\/Vent] \"I think what you're doing is noble but not noble enough to get paid for it.\""}

{"author":"Thereal_username","created_utc":1538688852,"num_comments":92,"score":41,"selftext":"I know what most of you are probably thinking: \"Oh some liberal came here to convince us why we need to keep the state apparatus intact forever? Downvote.\" Well that's not what's happening at all. I'm an anarchist through and through, I'm anti-capitalist, pro-gun, pro-equality, anti-racism, and totally in favor of dismantling the state and replacing it with small communities governed by direct democracy, so whatever I say here, remember that I agree with this sub on the fundamentals. And all I ask is that you read the whole thing before coming to any conclusion about what I have to say.\n\nBrothers, sisters, non-binary siblings, it's no secret that most anarchists don't vote, indeed many seem *proud* of that fact. They see it as pointless, or even playing into the hands of the state. To put it bluntly, this is pretty stupid, it deprives you of the little power you have and only reinforces the stereotype that leftists are spoiled suburban white kids. Please note that most of this is aimed at Americans, since I'm an American and our election is coming up in a month, but it can apply to other countries as well.\n\nLet's discuss the idea that voting is pointless first. In the U.S., voter turnout is abysmal, and the reasons for this are legion. Suppression of minority voters, too few polling stations, as well as things like gerrymandering and mudslinging by politicians making people feel like the whole thing is useless. And, yeah, they aren't totally wrong about that, every system has ways of putting a thumb on the scale of democracy. However none of those systems can ignore a tsunami of voices that swing the other way. Remember last year when an election for the Virginia House of Delegates came down to one vote? Or how George W. Bush won his election by three votes? Or how Donald Trump became president because of less than 100,000 votes in 3 states? That's less than a tenth of a percent of all votes cast in that election, whatever defeatist propaganda you've heard, votes *do* matter.\n\nThink about how many leftists or liberals willing to vote for leftists there are, if we all actually turned out and voted for our preferred candidates, we could have actual leftists as senators, governors, maybe even president, we could have an actual say in how things were run that doesn't pander to liberals. At the very least we would be working towards a solution to the massive student debt crisis, climate change, healthcare, America's mass shootings, and maybe we wouldn't be constantly invading Muslim countries. \n\nOh yeah, and let's not forget that many of the refugees from those wars are blocked from reaching safety here because we've let the racists put themselves in charge. I know that many anarchists prefer direct action, like giving aid after natural disasters. (If anyone reading this was one of the anarchist volunteers that distributed supplies after Hurricane Florence, thank you, you're a wonderful person.) We should obviously continue to do this, it gives us visibility and makes more mainstream folks realize that we aren't crazy. But more importantly we should always help those in need.\n\n*However,* there's more we can do to help those who need it. We can hand out supplies or break up Neo Nazi gatherings all day. But when some old white Christian theocrats are voted into office and decide that women have to carry their rape babies to term, or that someone with a gram of weed in their cup holder deserves to go to prison for life, there's nothing we can do. We have to put others in power that will end these sorts of abhorrent practices and voting is the best way of doing that.\n\nBut there's more than just electing representatives at stake. Most states in the U.S. have some referendums going on that are based on a popular vote with no bureaucratic interference whatsoever. Alabama, Oregon, and West Virginia are all holding referendums to try and restrict abortions. Not just voluntary abortions either, abortions for cases of rape and danger to the mother would be restricted as well. In Arkansas and Missouri, the people have a chance to increase the minimum wage and help thousands of workers. Five states have an opportunity to legalize medical or recreational marijuana. And there are tons of other initiatives on things like campaign finance, rights for felons, and environmental regulations. Check them out here if you don't believe me.\n\nhttps:\/\/ballotpedia.org\/2018_ballot_measures\n\nAnd all of this is being done without palms being greased or lobbyists giving favors to corrupt representatives. (Of course that's redundant.) If you live in one of these states, you do have some measure of power to positively affect where you live. By not utilizing that power, you're just allowing all the fascists to do what they want. Because even if you decide to just sit at home and complain on the internet, they're still going out and voting for their preferred rapist.\n\nOf course, and I'll just come right out and say it: Many of us will never have to face real consequences for that. Many of us are young, white, relatively well-off, and I'm willing to bet a substantial portion are men. We won't have to bear the brunt of the right-wing's rage the way women and minorities will. They have to fear losing their rights, control of their bodies, and even their lives. Part of the reason leftists are looked down on is because people see us as spoiled suburban kids just wanting to rebel against their parents, rather than people who want to eliminate hierarchies and make sure that everyone is taken care of. If you just shrug and claim \"both sides are the same\" when one side is putting children in concentration camps and the other side is trying to get those camps shut down, then you are part of the problem and you're proving our detractors right.\n\nI know that many of you are hoping for some sort of glorious revolution where we free the proletariat and destroy capitalism overnight but real life is more boring and complex than that. Even Marx wrote that the transition from capitalism had to happen on its own and you can't force it. Trying to leads to things like Soviet Russia and Red China, horrific regimes that have killed millions of people all under the pretense of leftism. All we can do is try and reform to get things closer to our ideal world, one step at a time. Liberal democracy is not ideal, but it's leagues better than feudalism, fascism, or theocracy, at least this way we have some basic rights and the ability to change things for the better without violence. We may not agree with liberals on economics, but at least they understand that concentration camps and rape are bad.\n\nSo if you're American, you need to register to vote and show up next month. If you're not, you still need to participate in your local elections. You have a small amount of power. It's up to you if you want to give it up or use it to help yourself, others, and your cause.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"I'm an anarchist, here's why we need to vote (really)"}

They are protesting poverty wages, precarious contracts and a determined unwillingness to respect their union rights. Now backed up by scooters, bikes and minicabs, they are demanding \u00a310 per hour \u2013 in a encouraging development towards solidarity across industries allying themselves with syndicalist food delivery workers and private hire drivers across the country. Only through such alliances will we conquer insecure contracts to put dignity in their stead.\n\nIn Sweden, we are increasingly forced to take on precarious work positions too, the result being not ever knowing whether we will get all the hours we need to survive - and at the same time being unable to plan ahead in our lives. These jointly planned strikes and demonstrations by hard-working hospitality, food delivery and transport workers are a huge inspiration to us.\n\nAs a matter of fact, this inspiration is key for many of the food delivery industry workers in the Swedish gig economy who now gravitate towards syndicalist organizing methods. The 32nd congress of the SAC wishes the best of luck to our fellow workers in the United Kingdom. We look forward towards the challenge of similar achievements back in Sweden.\n\nAll support to the BFAWU, IWGB United Private Hire Drivers, IWGB Couriers and Logistics, and the IWW Courier\u2019s Network unions!\n\nResolution adopted at the 32nd congress of the Central Organization of the Workers in Sweden, SAC \u2013 the Syndicalists\n\nSeptember 2018\nG\u00e4vle, Sweden","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"THE CENTRAL ORGANIZATION FOR WORKERS IN SWEDEN: SUPPORT FOR THE FAST FOOD SHUTDOWN STRIKE"}

I thank the mods for allowing me to keep the rest of the channels I\u2019ve added to the list. \n\nNewly Added channels not on OP:\n\nTovarich Endymion, BrendanMccooney, Red Star Video, Claudia Brown, SJW101, azureScapegoat, Benji Adam Wiskettes, DemocraticSocialist01, Comrade Hakim, FinnishBolshevik, Bat\u2019ko The Manarchist, ProSocialism, Flea Market Socialist, KnowingBetter, and a few others!\n\nAs a socialist I don't believe masterlists should constitute any kind of intellectual property that should be protected, especially in context of a masterlist that is being shared to spread awareness of leftist channels shared with the leftist community.

She uses dry humour and widely recognisable pop culture (her favourite subjects being Disney and Transformers) to look at intersecting social and political trends. While she\u2019s often spoken from a feminist perspective, her recent work has begun delving into Marxist analysis in a way she\u2019s very accessibly explained to the wide audience who watch her.\n\nRecommended video:[ Marxism! | The Whole Plate Episode 9](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pFMiuAtbMO0)\n\n[Jack Saint \/ LackingSaint](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/LackingSaint): Formerly did animations, now does video essays with political themes like in the link below.

His work includes critical readings of the white privilege themes of \u2018Get Out\u2019, the perhaps accidental Ayn Randian\/Objectivist themes of \u2018The Incredibles\u2019, and as seen below, the contentious approach to racism of \u2018Three BillBoards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u2019.\n\nRecommended video:[ How (Not) to Discuss Racism in Film - Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri | Renegade Cut](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7HkRPzmYxhU)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Step Back History](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCxTdWpLJurbGlFMWOwXWG_A): A history channel exploring important events from a progressive perspective.

Limited oversight also means things end up squandered in either case, and you end up with poverty and pollution. (On the capitalized end, it doesn't matter because of externalized costs. And on the socialist end, who is going to argue about wrongs against the main party in charge?)\n\nBecause both extremes are bad, it's better to strike a balance somewhere in the middle. And this is due to necessity of supporting a large modern civilization. However even that (as most things are now - honestly some balance between the two) is being misused. Things that should be socialized (health care, infrastructure, education) which would support the public are being privatized instead, and things that should be private (small business, one's personal affairs and opinions) are being pried into via things like regulation and publicized.

Pompeu Fabra University  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A common viewpoint about the social structure of advanced capitalism  \n&gt;  \n&gt;is that the 1% of the population that has larger capital and higher salaries,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;is the new dominant class, globally and locally. That 1% is considered to be  \n&gt;  \n&gt;formed by the owners and managers of multinational companies that are part of  \n&gt;  \n&gt;productive economies (where production and distribution of goods and services  \n&gt;  \n&gt;is done) and\/or finance economies (such as large banks and insurance companies),  \n&gt;  \n&gt;which due to their huge influence on political institutions and media, arguably  \n&gt;  \n&gt;exert an almighty power over the rest of the population, that is, the other 99%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;New slogans within progressive circles start to appear that focused on the need  \n&gt;  \n&gt;of mobilizing that 1%. In the US, for instance, Occupy Wall Street made this  \n&gt;  \n&gt;slogan theirs to point out that the most important problem was the conflict of  \n&gt;  \n&gt;interests between the 1% and the 99%. In Spain (including Catalonia) new social  \n&gt;  \n&gt;movements have appeared using this same slogan or principle, assuming that the  \n&gt;  \n&gt;conflict is between the majority of the population, commonly referred as the  \n&gt;  \n&gt;people, and this 1%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This view, however, is extraordinarily simplistic and doesn't help with the goal of  \n&gt;  \n&gt;transforming the society, as it does not give social and political movements the  \n&gt;  \n&gt;needed tools to analyze and tell apart the adversaries (that is, people or social groups  \n&gt;  \n&gt;that defend opposite interests to those of the transforming agents) from the allies  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(people that have similar and\/or compatible interests with those of the transforming  \n&gt;  \n&gt;agents).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This distinction -adversaries vs allies- is key, as the progressive project requires  \n&gt;  \n&gt;an ample alliance of forces that represent the majority of the population, especially  \n&gt;  \n&gt;the popular classes. But that majority is not, by far, the 99%, as there is at least a  \n&gt;  \n&gt;20% of the population that serves the 1% in its controlling and reproducing power  \n&gt;  \n&gt;relationships function, and which interests are intimately associated to the famous 1%.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This 20% plays a key role in the survival of the power system, where the 1% controls the  \n&gt;  \n&gt;economical and finance powers, and from there the political and media ones.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The image of the 99% against the 1% does not reflect the reality and erroneously assumes  \n&gt;  \n&gt;the possible alliance of the popular classes (which constitute almost 80% of the  \n&gt;  \n&gt;population) with this 20% which has opposite interests to those of the popular classes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Hence, the importance of recuperating scientific categories for the social structure -such as  \n&gt;  \n&gt;social classes- that have been abandoned and branded as old, in direct relation to the  \n&gt;  \n&gt;control of the 1% (the capitalist class) over society, in a way that the more power this  \n&gt;  \n&gt;class has, the less these terms or categories appear.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The professional class  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\---------------------------------  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A key component of this 20% of the population is the classed formed by professionals,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;most of them with higher education, which configures the conventional wisdom of the  \n&gt;  \n&gt;country and that benefits the 1%, due to the fact that as I've said before, they are  \n&gt;  \n&gt;at their service. Thomas Frank has written a book, \"Listen, Liberal\", which defines very  \n&gt;  \n&gt;well the nature of this professional class, that has configured the political and media  \n&gt;  \n&gt;culture of the country, defining what is \"acceptable\" and \"respectable\" and what not,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;confirming what many years before Noam Chomsky and Edward S. Herman had pointed in their  \n&gt;  \n&gt;excellent book \"Manufacturing Consent\".  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The components of this class originate mainly from the middle class with high income that  \n&gt;  \n&gt;have been to private schools in Spain (publicly subsidized) and to the elite universities  \n&gt;  \n&gt;both in Spain and in the US, and that are actually working on making acceptable in the current  \n&gt;  \n&gt;society a distribution of power based on an alleged meritocracy. And so, the majority of the  \n&gt;  \n&gt;members of this class share a number of values that can be branded as liberals (in the  \n&gt;  \n&gt;European sense of the word, in the US liberal is used to define social-democrats such as the  \n&gt;  \n&gt;candidate to the presidency Bernie Sanders. This different understanding of the word can lead  \n&gt;  \n&gt;to enormous confusion).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;These liberal values are projected on many different ways. With regards to education, they  \n&gt;  \n&gt;consider private better than public, as it allows the realization of an element highly valued  \n&gt;  \n&gt;by this class, the reproduction of a hierarchical and social distinction. In Spain, the  \n&gt;  \n&gt;percentage of the population that attends private schools (publicly subsidized) is 30%,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;including, apart from the bourgeois and petite bourgeois, predominantly the professional  \n&gt;  \n&gt;middle class.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The dogmas of this class  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\--------------------------------------  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In economy, this social class is usually in defense of the \"economic man\", who via his invisible  \n&gt;  \n&gt;hand allows the expression of freedom. Works against public policies that have as an objective  \n&gt;  \n&gt;the redistribution of the resources as it considers this unnecessary. Justifies his position  \n&gt;  \n&gt;in the social power hierarchy based on the merits of his qualifications, and has a huge respect  \n&gt;  \n&gt;and docility towards the 1%, competing for his favors. The managerial component within the 1%  \n&gt;  \n&gt;comes mainly from this class. The directors and managers of the big companies of the country  \n&gt;  \n&gt;belong to this class.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In the health system, favors a private system like in education, as it considers it more efficient  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(against, by the way, all available evidence, as shown in other of my articles: \"The enormous  \n&gt;  \n&gt;limitations of the neo-liberal model: the case of the health system in the US\", P\u00fablico, 22.03.16)\",  \n&gt;  \n&gt;and, although it is not opposed to the public responsibility of guaranteeing access to the public  \n&gt;  \n&gt;health system, sees this responsibility as an aid, favoring private health systems (although  \n&gt;  \n&gt;publicly subsidized), stressing the individual responsibility on each ones health, and demanding a  \n&gt;  \n&gt;contribution in the form of payment for the use of these services, mainly to avoid the \"abuse\" in  \n&gt;  \n&gt;the use of a public health system by the \"popular masses\".  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Large part of the apparatus of conservative parties (PP) and liberals (Ciudadanos and Converg\u00e8ncia),  \n&gt;  \n&gt;including social-liberals (some sectors of PSOE), are an example of this ideas. Careful with their  \n&gt;  \n&gt;words and respecting what is politically correct, every now and then they let see their elitist  \n&gt;  \n&gt;and classicist manners. Clear examples of this behavior are the founders and leaders of Ciudadanos,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;the party that best represents this mentality and this professional class.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The statement of Mr. F\u00e9lix de Az\u00faa -founder of Ciudadanos- in reference to Barcelona's mayor, Mrs.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Ada Colau, saying that instead of being a mayor she should be selling fish in a fishmonger, show  \n&gt;  \n&gt;clearly his disdain for that job, a classicism very prevalent in this professional class. The desire  \n&gt;  \n&gt;of staying within the politically correct language, and the aspiration of stay away from the cultural  \n&gt;  \n&gt;and ideological icons (such as the Catholic church) of the traditional Spanish right (such as PP and  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Uni\u00f3n Democr\u00e1tica) turned them into the secular liberal right. Another example of classicism is their  \n&gt;  \n&gt;frequent reference to the working class as the \"low class\", expression frequently use in the political  \n&gt;  \n&gt;culture of the country, which constantly defines the social structure in Spain (including Catalonia)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;as high class, middle class and low class. I refer to Albert Rivera's speeches for examples of this.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The obstacle for a change is much bigger than the 1%  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\----------------------------------------------------  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This 20% is the main impediment for a progressive social change in the country. And this is due to  \n&gt;  \n&gt;the fact that their interests, as I've stated before, are clearly linked to those of the 1%. One  \n&gt;  \n&gt;of the best examples is the polarization of the welfare state by social class in Spain.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The educational system, polarized by social class, that happens in Spain (even more stressed in  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Catalonia), with 30% of the kids (belonging to this class mainly) going to private schools  \n&gt;  \n&gt;(publicly subsidized), and the other 70% going to public schools (with a lower cost per student),  \n&gt;  \n&gt;cannot from a progressive point of view be defended and\/or kept, to which both the 1% and the 20% will  \n&gt;  \n&gt;strongly oppose, as their privileges depend on the reproduction of the system where the 1% establishes  \n&gt;  \n&gt;the norms that make possible this polarization of society.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;And this is the mistake of some sectors, well-intentioned, but profoundly wrong, of some progressives  \n&gt;  \n&gt;in this country. To establish an strategy for a change based on the understanding that the conflict  \n&gt;  \n&gt;of interests is that of the 99% against the 1%, is profoundly wrong, as this 20% has opposed interests,  \n&gt;  \n&gt;more closely related to those of the 1% than to the majority of the population. Hence their error.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As clear as that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOriginal article: r\/[https:\/\/blogs.publico.es\/dominiopublico\/16910\/algunas-izquierdas-estan-equivocadas-el-mito-del-99-versus-el-1\/](https:\/\/blogs.publico.es\/dominiopublico\/16910\/algunas-izquierdas-estan-equivocadas-el-mito-del-99-versus-el-1\/)","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Some \"Lefts\" are wrong.

Since then, Hezbollah and Israel have fought on and off again over the years, and they also hold seats in the Lebanese parliament. They have also been designated as a terrorist group by many Western nations, including the United States, partly for being an enemy of Israel, and partly for occasionally carrying out bombings that have killed civilians (mostly in the past). While I think it would be safe to say that Hezbollah isn't sympathetic to socialism (according to the info in [this Jacobin article](https:\/\/www.jacobinmag.com\/2016\/12\/hezbollah-lebanon-iran-islamic-revolution-labor\/)), they have received praise from various leftists over the years for fighting against Israel. Opinion on them is divided, especially in recent years (primarily due to their decision to support Assad in the Syrian Civil War), with some saying that they're a genuine popular political and resistance movement, and others saying that they're just Iranian puppets, though much Lebanese people seem to support them according to polls. \n\nBut Hezbollah's politics aside, I do find their [fighting capabilities](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hezbollah_armed_strength) to be impressive, as they're considered by many observers to be the most powerful guerrilla group\/ non-state actor in the world. They were able to successfully force the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) out of Southern Lebanon during the [1985-2000 South Lebanon conflict](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/South_Lebanon_conflict_(1985%E2%80%932000)), and they were able to fight the IDF to a stalemate\\* during the [2006 Lebanon War](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2006_Lebanon_War). And by all accounts, they've only gotten stronger since then, though to be fair, they probably wouldn't be the force they are today without the large amount of aid they've received from Iran over the years.  But I'm curious: do anarchists think that an ideal 'anarchist military' would be modeled after Hezbollah?\n\n\\* While most observers say that from a military standpoint, the 2006 Lebanon War ended in a stalemate, in the years since then, many say that it turned out to be a major propaganda and political victory for Hezbollah, since in the eyes of the world, Hezbollah was able to 'resist Israel's invasion', and it gave them a lot of political legitimacy in Lebanon.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"What do anarchists think of Hezbollah?"}

No bright future; just focus on what you can do now.\n\nI've been to a number of perfectly legal protest gatherings that are little more than just an opportunity for people to come together and either shout about what they don't like or build community around the mainstream liberal vision of climate justice and progress (i.e. [350.org](https:\/\/350.org) and the People's Climate March). I've expressed my fears of collapse and have had a lot of people sympathize or agree, but most believe any realistic and non-optimistic message will get ignored. Really I like the nascent community I have with these people, but it can be a bit frustrating. I think a place for the dark emotions that come from honesty is very needed. Despite the fact that Alberta is almost totally reactionary.\n\nSo what more could I do to at least start to turn the tide of consciousness against this oppressive narrative?

{"author":"lusrec","created_utc":1539039205,"num_comments":0,"score":11,"selftext":"\\[...\\]\n\nBy my reckoning, on this score the opinion of anarchists cannot be called into question, and in fact, well before the Bolshevik revolution, it never was queried by anyone. Anarchy means no government, and thus, all the more emphatically, no dictatorship, meaning an absolute government, uncontrolled and without constitutional restraints. But whenever the Bolshevik revolution broke out, it appears that our friends may have confused what constitutes a revolution against an existing government with what was implied by a new government which had just dominated the revolution in order to apply the brakes to it and steer it in the direction of its party political purposes. And so our friends have all but declared themselves Bolsheviks.\n\nNow, the Bolsheviks are merely marxists who have remained honest, conscientious marxists, unlike their teachers and models, the likes of Guesde, Plekhanov, Hyndman, Scheidemann, Noske, etc., whose fate you know. We respect their sincerity, we admire their energy, but, just as we have never seen eye to eye with them in theoretical matters, so we could not align ourselves with them when they make the transition from theory to practice.\n\nBut perhaps the truth is simply this: our pro-Bolshevik friends take the expression \" dictatorship of the proletariat\" to mean simply the revolutionary action of the workers in taking possession of the land and the instruments of labor, and trying to build a society and organize a way oflife in which there will be no place for a class that exploits and oppresses the producers.\n\nThus construed, the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" would be the effective power of all workers trying to bring down capitalist society and would thus turn into Anarchy as soon as resistance from reactionaries would have ceased and no one can any longer seek to compel the masses by violence to obey and work for him. In which case, the discrepancy between us would be nothing more than a question of semantics. Dictatorship of the proletariat would signify the dictatorship of everybody, which is to say, it would be a dictatorship no longer, just as government by everybody is no longer a government in the authoritarian, historical and practical sense of the word.\n\nBut the real supporters of \" dictatorship of the proletariat\" do not take that line, as they are making quite plain in Russia. Of course, the proletariat has a hand in this, just as the people has a part to play in democratic regimes, that is to say, to conceal the reality of things. In reality, what we have is the dictatorship of one party, or rather, of one party's leaders: a genuine dictatorship, with its decrees, its penal sanctions, its henchmen and, above all, its armed forces which are at present also deployed in the defense of the revolution against its external enemies, but which will tomorrow be used to impose the dictators' will upon the workers, to apply a brake on revolution, to consolidate the new interests in the process of emerging and protect a new privileged class against the masses.\n\nGeneral Bonaparte was another one who helped defend the French Revolution against the European reaction, but in defending it, he strangled the life out of it. Lenin, Trotsky and their comrades are assuredly sincere revolutionaries ( ... ) and they will not be turning traitors-but they are preparing the governmental structures which those who will come after them will utilize to exploit the Revolution and do it to death. They will be the first victims of their methods and I am afraid that the Revolution will go under with them.\n\nHistory repeats itself *mutatis mutandis*, it was Robespierre's dictatorship that brought Robespierre to the guillotine and paved the way for Napoleon.\n\nSuch are my general thoughts on affairs in Russia.\n\nAs for detailed news we have had, it is as yet too varied and too contradictory to merit risking an opinion. It may be, too, that lots of things that strike us as bad are the products of that situation, and, in Russia's particular circumstances, there was no option but to do what they have done. We would do better to wait, especially as anything we will say cannot have any influence upon the course of events in Russia and might be misinterpreted in Italy and appear to echo the reaction's partisan calumnies.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Errico Malatesta's letter to Luigi Fabbri : on the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" (1919)"}

{"author":"off-the-grid-ama","created_utc":1539096805,"num_comments":19,"score":0,"selftext":"**TL;DR Version:** Deep Ecology is a problem in the anarchist community, it is rooted in problematic far right elements and must be eliminated by whatever means are necessary.\n\n-----\n\n\nHello everyone, today I'd like to talk about a topic that I feel has been severely neglected in anarchist spaces, the topic of Deep Ecology. It's not one ideology or even multiple, it is a broader mindset that has slowly been festering in anarchist spaces since the post-World War II world. It is a threat that spawns from our greatest enemies themselves to contaminate us. The consequences of this contamination is a partial or even major crypto-fascist takeover. \n\n- **What IS DeEcoism?:** Deep Ecology, or DeEcoism as we will be calling it for the sake of length, could also be labeled as, \"Dark Green Ideology\" is a philosophy that believes that non-human entities carry an equal or greater moral status than human entities. In other words, believing that non-human organisms such as animals\/plants or even geographic features like rivers or mountains have worth outside of their utility to humanity. DeEcoism believes that society should be structured based on this belief. \n\n- **What ISN'T DeEcoism?:** DeEcoism isn't necessarily ALL environmentalist or other pro-nature beliefs. The term only applies to beliefs that place either of those things outside of the human utility they provide. Obviously global warming, resource scarcity, and pollution are tangible problems that can and currently do negatively affected humanity, but DeEcoism is being against those things, not out of a belief in human worth, but out of non-human worth. The former is non-problematic, the latter is problematic. \n\nThere are many so-called anarchists in our spaces who are DeEcoists. This term would apply to many Anarcho-Primitivists, Veganarchists, Eco-Anarchists, and so on and so forth but even outside of those, many anarchists have internalized DeEcoism in some way. This is a very big problem because it's a belief that even in a vacuum runs contrary to many other aspects of anarchism. We joke about many things in society being, \"spooks\" but such a thing is a big part of anarchist theory, organizing life so that it is dependent on reaching tangible, rational benefits for the individuals within. \n\nDeEcoism does not necessarily seek tangible benefits mainly for humanity, but for quasi-mystical constructs. It is a projection of humanity onto that which isn't human, can't be human, and for all intents and purposes isn't human. Obviously we can see this in something like a mountain, an ecosystem, or a tree, but it gets murkier when we deal with something like a dog or a cat. Still, even in the latter case, they're philosophical zombies at best that we project a capacity for emotion and thought onto. This is a topic I want to make longer posts about, but this is the gist of my and others critique of DeEcoism. \n\nHowever, to truly understand why DeEcoism is problematic, we must go back to its origins. The origin of Deep Ecology can be found as far back as the Romanticism movement in the West. You could especially point to the Lebensreform movement in the 19th century. These movements placed a very bizarre emphasis on \"natural beauty, authentic ways of living, and physical health\" all of which are societal opiates at best and problematic abstractions at worst. These movements weren't explicitly political, but they were very much associated with the ***far right-wing*** of society. \n\nIt was a purist, mystical tool of and for the bourgeois, especially those who clung to tradition in society. In fact, the Lebensreform movement formed a big foundation of the Volkisch movement that would come later on. It soon mutated into the concept of Blood and Soil, the pseudo-scientific belief that people  are, \"attached\" to a nation's land. This should be sounding familiar to you right now, and you'd be right, the Volkisch movement would spawn none other than the Nazis themselves and the Romantics would have a big influence on fascism which itself is an ideology which mystifies statehood and nationhood. \n\nMake no mistake, the Nazis especially believed in Deep Ecology, they were among the first to truly put Deep Ecology into active political practice. Wehrboos won't hesitate to tell you about how much the nazi reich legislated for animals and forests and all that nonsense, it's all true. Keep in mind that this wasn't something tacked onto their ideology, it was a central aspect of their fucked-up paradigm. They believed that, \"nature\" was the greatest Nazi of them all because nature eliminates the weak, elevates the strong, and has very harsh conditions. \n\nNot to mention the fact that Nazis and many right-wingers even today are biological essentialists to their core. Even this should be enough to drive any conscious anarchist far far away from any Deep Ecology. Again, this wasn't something that you could argue that maybe even a broken nazi clock is right twice a day, this was at the ***CORE*** of their twisted perspective, and not only that, it was ***THEIR*** invention, it was an invention of the right-wing and that should make you want to be as far away from it as possible, but wait, there's more. \n\nI genuinely think that the anarchist community would be very different if not for the influence of the post-WW2 crypto-nazis. Figures like Martin Heidegger, Savitri Devi, Petti Linkola, Georg Werner Haverbeck, etc. were all either outright or underground Nazis or far right-wingers who had some major role in the modern Deep Ecology movement. Savitri Devi especially effectively founded all modern animal rights movements that exist today, without her there would be very very few advocating for animal rights at best, you can be sure of that. Haverbeck also got the ball rolling with mainstream Green parties and seduced leftists into it. \n\nHeidegger, well he was unambiguously a Nazi, but his, \"Question Concerning Technology\" is quoted even today. I get nauseous whenever I see people referencing Linkola who believed that it was justifiable to create a fascist totalitarian state if it meant protecting trees in some forest. The fact that these people have any influence at all in anarchist circles is problematic, much less basing anything resembling the core of your beliefs on such xenophobic, pseudo-scientific, illogical bologna. \n\nWe can see the influence when veganarchists shame POC for not buying more expensive vegan options sold by bourgeois whites. We can see the influence when AnPrims appropriate and distort aspects of First Nations culture. We can see the influence when AnPrims tell people with chronic illnesses that their death in their ideal world is an acceptable loss. We can see the influence when Eco-Anarchists cheer at the arrest or even death of POC poachers. We can see the influence when Eco-Anarchists advocate for pet stores to prioritize free water for several gallon aquariums in times of drought while POC and women suffer heat stroke in the hundreds. We can see the influence when any anarchist reacts more negatively to animal abuse than the abuse of women and other marginalized groups. \n\nI'm not saying that all of such groups advocate for these specific things, my point is that the taint of fascism is subtle and must be eliminated whenever possible. It gets in the way of the real struggle of real people with real emotions for the sake of spooky constructs. In conclusion, we as a community must immediately and totally rejected Deep Ecology as soon as possible. If you see it, call it out for what it is and ostracize whoever continues to spread crypto-fascist propaganda. If you currently believe in it, stop doing that, that's all I can say. I'm looking forward to discussing this with you all. ","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"The Danger of, \"Deep Ecology\", Anarchist or Otherwise"}

{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1539137286,"num_comments":2,"score":34,"selftext":"Peter Kropotkin seems to have founded his critique of capitalism not on arguments about labor and production but on a fundamentally distributive claim\u2014the claim that society\u2019s wealth properly belongs to all. Every member of modern industrial society, he noted, benefits from (I quote) \u201can immense capital accumulated by those who have gone before him\u201d (The Conquest of Bread [1892] 1995, 11). And among those wealth-creating predecessors, he paid special attention to poor and working people and their sufferings:\n\n\u201cWhole generations, that lived and died in misery, oppressed and ill-treated by their masters, and worn out by toil, have handed on this immense inheritance\u201d (The Conquest of Bread [1892] 1995, 14). Yet the descendants of those who paid this terrible price, instead of being treated as the inheritors of a vast richness, are denied any property rights at all. For all the vast wealth produced by modern railways, for instance, \u201cif the children of those who perished by the thousands while excavating the railway cuttings and tunnels were to assemble one day, crowding in their rags and hunger, to demand bread from the shareholders, they would be met with bayonets and grapeshot\u201d ([1892] 1995, 17).\n\nMost importantly (especially if you're an anti-work person), Kropotkin does not say that such a person deserves a share of wealth because he or she works a certain amount. On the contrary, the entire production apparatus must be treated as a single, common inheritance. I therefore deserve a share of production not because I labor but because I own (via inheritance) a share of the entire production apparatus. Kropotkin appeals to labor, to be sure, but not just the labor of the present.\n\nInstead, it is past labor that is most fundamentally the source of the productive apparatus that we all inherit, so the heritage of labor is as important as its current condition. What is more, he grounds the right to a common inheritance not just in a long, shared history of work but equally in other historical accumulations such as inventions as well as forms of suffering, deprivation, and bloodshed . In this broad panorama, which encompasses the whole history of all of mankind, there can be no accounting of who produced how much or whose suffering was greater; the only practical as well as ethical conclusion is, as he put it, \u201cAll belongs to all\u201d ([1892] 1995), 19).\n\nKropotkin always insisted on starting with distribution and claims of distributive justice. Why is capitalism unjust? One must begin with a historical account of where wealth comes from (here, I quote):\n\n\"For thousands of years millions of men have laboured to clear the forests, to drain the marshes, and to open up highways by land and water. Every rood of soil we cultivate in Europe has been watered by the sweat of several races of men. Every acre has its story of enforced labor, of intolerable toil, of the people\u2019s suffering. Every mile of railway, every yard of tunnel, has received its share of human blood. . . . Millions of human beings have laboured to create this civilization on which we pride ourselves today. Other millions, scattered through the globe, labour to maintain it. Without them, nothing would be left in fifty years but ruins. . . . There is not even a thought, or an invention, which is not common property, born of the past and the present. . . . By what right then can anyone whatever appropriate the least morsel of this immense whole and say\u2014This is mine, not yours? \"(Kropotkin [1892] 1995, 14\u201316)\n\nAnd the political conclusion, for Kropotkin, followed directly (in words that sound oddly tuned to our own times, in spite of the fact that they were written in 1892): \"We must recognize, and loudly proclaim, that everyone, whatever his grade in the old society, whether strong or weak, capable or incapable, has, before everything, the right to live, and that society is bound to share amongst all, without exception, the means of existence it has at its disposal. . . . A \u201cright to well-being\u201d means the possibility of living like human beings, and of bringing up children to be members of a society better than ours, whilst the \u201cright to work\u201d only means the right to be always a wage-slave, a drudge, ruled over and exploited by the middle class of the future. The right to well-being is the social revolution, the right to work means nothing but the treadmill of commercialism. (Kropotkin [1892] 1995, 28, 30)\n\nIt is not the worker (as worker) whose claims are prioritized here but he member of society, the inheritor of a great common estate (in which each and every one of us has a share). It is not just labor that founds that inheritance, in this view, but also things like suffering, bloodshed, ingenuity, and shared experience; it is therefore the entire society that is the source of value.\n\nHe suggests that the material riches of the modern era had to be understood as a kind of inheritance from millennia of experimentation and innovation.\n\nKropotkin expressed the claims of inherited suffering when he touches on the legacies of mining:\n\n\"The shafts of the mine still bear on their rocky walls the marks made y the pick of the workman who toiled to excavate them. The space between each prop in the underground galleries might be marked as a miner\u2019s grave; and who can tell what each of these graves has cost, in tears, in privations, in unspeakable wretchedness, to the family who depended on the scanty wage of the worker cut off in his prime by firedamp, rockfall, or flood. ([1892] 1995, 14)\n\nNor is this only a matter of the structural violence of the mining industry. Across a host of domains, contemporary claims are grounded in past suffering and past contributions that require redress or compensation to the current generation. Indeed, claims to social payments and social services today are commonly grounded not only in production (\u201cI am worthy because I have worked hard all my life\u201d) and reproduction (\u201cI deserve it because I am raising five kids\u201d) but also in past injuries (\u201cWe struggled against apartheid,\u201d \u201cWe are descended from those who lost their land,\u201detc.), injuries which are often understood as both collective and inherited across generations.\n\nThe fundamental idea is that wealth, being the product of social labor, social suffering, and social innovation, should be in some way shared by society as a whole.\n\nI personally think that Kropotkin gets to the heart of things by grounding rights to distribution not in productive labor at all but in an unconditional claim of ownership. In his account, I don\u2019t deserve to receive goods because I produce them; I deserve a share of production because I own (as an inheritance) a share of the entire production apparatus and its output.\n\nIn short:\n\nKropotkin argues that value is produced by society as a whole, that all members of society should be regarded as shareholders in a collective enterprise, and that everyone thus has a right to a share of the total social product.\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Here's a short overview of Peter Kropotkin's anarcho-communist main critique of capitalism, is there anything to add here?"}

Sometimes I feel like I'm overdoing it and maybe being paranoid about certain things, other times I feel like I should be doing even more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I understand the basics, don't talk about organizing or planning over the internet only in person, keep things on a need to know basis, don't talk about illegal things, avoid social media, taking\/posting pictures of events, leave phones at home\/always assume a cell phone is unsafe, etc. My big worry is for what I read online. It seems like, at a minimum, I should be using the Tor browser. Does that go for everything anarchism related? Should I be using it even to just read crimethinc or anarchist library type sites?  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould I be using more? I know your internet provider can see if you're using Tor, so should I be going a step further and using something like tails? I read through all the info on the Tor site for trying to remain anonymous, and I guess I don't know which level I should be aiming for.  I mean, do I take it as far as not even using my home internet connection and instead, say, use a vpn and go to a public place with wifi? What about going on reddit? Is it even worth it to try and use it through Tor? I assume I'd have to make a new account so it wouldn't be linked to an IP address.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShould I be worried about other areas?

{"author":"BuildAutonomy","created_utc":1539245034,"num_comments":2,"score":3,"selftext":"The only way to save the planet\n\nWhen it comes to protecting the environment, nearly any social system would be better than the one we have now. Capitalism is the first social arrangement in human history to endanger the survival of our species and life on earth in general. Capitalism provides incentives to exploit and destroy nature, and creates an atomized society that is incapable of protecting the environment. Under capitalism, ecocide is literally a right. Environmental protections are \u201ctrade barriers\u201d; preventing a corporation from clear-cutting land it has purchased is a violation of private property and free enterprise. Companies are allowed to make millions of tons of plastic, most of it for throwaway packaging, despite the fact that they have no plan for disposing of it and not even any idea what will happen with it all; plastic does not decompose, so plastic trash is filling up the ocean and appearing in the bodies of marine creatures, and it may last millions of years. To save endangered rhinoceros from poachers, game wardens have started sawing off their valuable horns; but the poachers are killing them anyway because once they are extinct, the value of the few remaining bits of rhinoceros ivory will go through the roof.\n\nAnd despite all this, universities have the audacity to indoctrinate students to believe that a communal society would be incapable of protecting the environment because of the so-called tragedy of the commons. This myth is often explained thus: imagine a society of sheepherders owns the grazing land in common. They benefit collectively if each grazes a smaller number of sheep, because the pasture stays fertile, but any one of them benefits individually if he overgrazes, because he will receive a greater share of the product \u2014 thus collective ownership supposedly leads to depletion of resources. The historical examples intended to corroborate this theory are generally drawn from colonial and postcolonial situations in which oppressed people, whose traditional forms of organization and stewardship have been undermined, are crowded onto marginal land, with predictable results. The sheepherding scenario assumes a situation that is extremely rare in human history: a collective comprised of atomized, competitive individuals who value personal wealth over social bonds and ecological health, and lack social arrangements or traditions that can guarantee sustainable, shared use.\n\nCapitalism has already caused the biggest wave of extinctions to hit the planet since an asteroid collision killed off the dinosaurs. To prevent global climate change from bringing about total ecological collapse, and stop pollution and overpopulation from killing off most of the planet\u2019s mammals, birds, amphibians, and marine life, we have to abolish capitalism, hopefully within the next few decades. Human-caused extinctions have been apparent for at least a hundred years now. The greenhouse effect has been widely acknowledged for nearly two decades. The best that the reputed ingenuity of free enterprise has come up with is carbon trading, a ridiculous farce. Likewise, we cannot trust some world government to save the planet. A government\u2019s first concern is always its own power, and it builds the base of this power upon economic relationships. The governing elite must maintain a privileged position, and that privilege depends on the exploitation of other people and of the environment.\n\nLocalized, egalitarian societies linked by global communication and awareness are the best chance for saving the environment. Self-sufficient, self-contained economies leave almost no carbon footprint. They don\u2019t need petroleum to ship goods in and waste out, or huge amounts of electricity to power industrial complexes to produce goods for export. They must produce most of their energy themselves via solar, wind, biofuel, and similar technologies, and rely more on what can be done manually than on electrical appliances. Such societies pollute less because they have fewer incentives to mass production and lack the means to dump their byproducts on others\u2019 land. In place of busy airports, traffic-clogged highways, and long commutes to work, we can imagine bicycles, buses, interregional trains, and sailboats. Likewise, populations will not spiral out of control, because women will be empowered to manage their fertility and the localized economy will make apparent the limited availability of resources.\n\nAn ecologically sustainable world would have to be anti-authoritarian, so no society could encroach on its neighbors to expand its resource base; and cooperative, so societies could band together in self-defense against a group developing imperialist tendencies. Most importantly, it would demand a common ecological ethos, so people would respect the environment rather than regarding it simply as raw material to exploit. We can begin building such a world now, by learning from ecologically sustainable indigenous societies, sabotaging and shaming polluters, spreading a love for nature and an awareness of our bioregions, and establishing projects that allow us to meet our needs for food, water, and energy locally.\n\nRecommended Reading\nNirmal Sengupta, Managing Common Property: Irrigation in India and The Philippines, New Delhi: Sage, 1991.\n\nWinona LaDuke, Recovering the Sacred: The Power of Naming and Claiming, Cambridge: South End Press, 2005.\n\nJan Martin Bang, Ecovillages: A Practical Guide to Sustainable Communities.

A lot of trade that comes through Iceland comes through my city. Previously my city was very working class. Everything that was found in the city was made by the people who lived here, out of raw materials harvested from the ocean, coasts or forests around us. My state has it's own culture and it's own little unique social oddities and linguistic peculiarities. \n\n\nThat's nearly all gone now. People from out of state, and even from as far as other countries, have been buying up properties in my city and either jacking the prices up on them or tearing them down and building fugly that aren't really useful to locals. An old historical train station was bought by someone from from NYC and turned into a restaurant 99% of locals can't afford to eat at. A grocery store known for being cheap was brought by someone from Boston, who tore it down and built a nightclub. What used to be a grassy and undeveloped area now has a Whole Foods on it. What used to be a hardware store housed inside another old historical building is now a hipster bar with insanely priced drinks. A co-op I loved in one area had to close down because rent keeps going up and up, which was too exspensive for the co-op itself, but additionally all their regular customers were forced to move out and into adjacent cities. And now all the adjacent cities are seeing *their* rents going up and up because all the people from my city and being booted out and looking for new places to live. All the old blue collar jobs that individuals could live on have been replaced with min-wage or nearly min-way jobs working at gift shops or restaurants. SO many places that used to be old, historical homes are now gift shops with Chinese made goods that have our local lingo printed on them in various fonts. Our kids stopped talking like locals anymore because everybody thinks it's weird if you're the kid that uses a word that only appears in the mouths of their parents or printed onto tshirts and coffee mugs found in the half dozen gift shops they see on their way to school.\n\n\nI work in a bakery at nights making area-themed pastries. My rent has gone up three times in the last year and a half and I already have two other room mates. People who could afford to move away did, people who could not afford to move ended up homeless and the vast majority of them are still on the streets of the city, doing drugs. Homelessness is everywhere and going up as fast as violent crime is. (And this is in a state with one of the lowest crime rates in the union!) I'm just really tired and stressed. Both because I've been making overpriced treats for tourists all night and because of all that's been done to my city in the last few years.

I started reading theory (On the internet, of course, It's too expensive to buy the actual books) when I was around, eleven, I'd say?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm just surrounded by casual racists.\n\n\"Indians don't care if their babies die or starve to death, as they have so many.\"\n\n\"Refugees are the single reason for almost all of our problems\"\n\nAnd those were quotes from my teachers, the people I'm supposed to \"look up\" to, according to quite literally propaganda books that we spend 4 classroom hours per week studying. One of the most comedic quotes i found in the book, that we had to learn by heart: \"Greece is a democracy. It allows equal representation for all, and provides public services to aid the ones in need.\". Meanwhile, half the people I know live with 400 euros a week. 400 euros is literally pocket change for the government officials, who are corrupt as hell. I don't have evidence, but It's obvious. So much money just disappears.  Golden Dawn is the third party, and albeit with not that much votes, it was and still is rapidly growing, from what I've read.\n\n(Context: Golden Dawn is the nazi party of Greece, the biggest and most downright nazi party in Europe.)\n\nI've done what I can, several of my classmates, instead of being obedient slaves of anyone with authority, I've pointed in the right direction.\n\nBut that's not enough, is it?\n\nI'm just filled with insecurity. Best case scenario, GD doesn't get voted in, we're stuck in a perpetual state of debt and I work as an office slave until retirement.\n\nWorst case scenario, GD gets elected, I flee the country, I die 30 years early due to a mix of homelessness, inability to find a job and lack of aid.\n\nI've tried to radicalize many of my classmates, get them interested in revolutions, in rebellions, in protesting.\n\n\"Aren't we a little too young for that?\"\n\n\"Eh, it's not time. We should just focus on studying, and then do anything we need to do.\"\n\nI've thought of putting up flyers, leaflets etc. but considering my downright-fascist teachers, pretty sure it wouldn't be taken lightly.\n\nAnother thing I'd like to add, is that I live in an island called \"Lesbos\". Basically, It's where most refugees washed up on, due to it's close proximity from Turkey. We're keeping those refugees and giving them \"Privileges\". Said privileges include:\n\n1. Constant harassment by journalists, newspaper organizations and violent fascists, additionally \"Non-Profit Organizations\", who it's staff takes special tax breaks and gets extra welfare by the EU for helping, WHICH IT COULD GIVE TO THE REFUGEES. So, basically, when the \"Charity workers\" decide to take a break from sipping a bit of luxury french wine in their comfortable beds in expensive hotels, they basically harass refugees by \"protecting\" them and controlling them.\n2. They live in a place called \"Moriacamp\". It's basically a prison. Barbed wire all around, 5M high concrete walls and tents for the refugees to live in, They're allowed free transit, but in separate free buses on certain routes. Fairly certain there's a curfew in effect for them. One time, they gathered in Sappho Square to protest their, quite honestly, shitty living conditions. Fascists show up, start throwing rocks at WOMEN AND CHILDREN. Police ALSO shows up, like half of the police starts throwing rocks too and the other refuses to do anything. Several people were hospitalized. I don't know if anyone was killed. This event barely reached the press. Everyone forgot about it.\n\nThankfully, there is some organisation against this. Several anarchists have decided to set up squats, refurbish old abandoned buildings and provide warm food, warm shelter and ***unbiased help*** to the refugees. The police's response? Close down the squats and arrest those involved in making them. KKE (The Communist Party Of Greece)'s response? Publicly denounce the actions the police took and demand \"The immediate liberation of the refugees\". That's all. That's literally all they did. And they didn't even insist on the matter. Journalists are constantly bashing anarchists. \"Anarchist\" has become a catch-all term for vandalists, people who murder\/harass Greeks and basically all the crime is blamed on two: The refugees, and the anarchists.\n\nI just need advice. What can I do? I'm basically in the middle class. I feel like a piece of shit every time I spend money on something I don't need. I feel like a piece of shit in general. I can't do anything about this... bullshit situation the refugees and Greece as a whole is in, and I just... spend my money on useless stuff that could be WAAAAY better spent on helping people in need. I just... I dunno how to donate or help. My parents wouldn't allow it, anyway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR Need advice on how to act politically when underage and\/or how to donate to people in need\/help them.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"I'm afraid about my future."}

This is of course extremely wasteful especially when a big issue facing communities in the US is lack of access to healthy food as well as food insecurity. \n\nThis led me to asking what's the purpose of lawns in the US, with a larger focus in urban areas in particular. I personally dont see a lot of people using their lawns for anything in particular, it's usually an area for the dog and kids to play and or host parties during the summer but not much else. This got me to thinking of people dont use their entire yard maybe theyd be willing to 'donate' a portion of it for urban farming. \n\nThe idea I had was to start an organization aimed at making this a reality, urban farming aimed at using unsused land to provide cheap food for the community, maybe in the way of supplementing school lunch programs with what's grown if not just setting up or working with existing shelters and food banks. Maybe the program could even be tied to another program aimed at teaching kids about urban farming, nutrition and cooking, allowing them to get some hands on experience as well as giving them something to do in their downtime. \n\nOnly problem is I have no idea how to get something like this off the ground, I've never organized anything before and I'm unfamiliar with any governmental requirements I'd have to meet for this to become a reality. Any help and or constructive criticism on the idea would be extremely valuable. Sorry if this is a little jumbled I'm on mobile, I can expand on any of the ideas in the comments as well.

I really fuckin like applied political theory, but I don't know how valuable that's going to be if I pursue a PhD. Both from a self actualization standpoint and an economic one. I'm lucky enough to get through undergrad debt free, and I'd just be another afluent white boy in academia. But I just don't know what to do post grad. I think I have a pretty competitive resume but if I can avoid it I'd prefer not to just do something creating value for my boss (obviously still happens in academia but there's way more freedom). \n\nI'm most torn about activism. Whatever I do I can still be active in my community. But would I be helping to build a socialist movement more as a professor or doing something else? Honestly I'd just love to hear thoughts on this stuff and what other options there are post grad other than grad school or business shit. I have some NGO experience but they have their own problems. \n\nI'm just really struggling rn with holding to my ideals (which I might be in a material position to uphold) and just settling for activism after work. I'm really just hoping to hear about folks advice and experiences after graduating with social science or humanities degrees.

The r\/leftcommunism SR looks innocuous enough, but the pinned ICP manifesto is the first hint, as well as the mods immediately responding to posts with questions or even vague confusion about leftcoms and partnership with anarchists with hostility, derision, and regurgitated Marx quotes devoid of understanding like your average tankie. Finally, those same mods will absolutely discourage any looking at reading beyond Marx and Bordiga, chastising at least one person for even mentioning Paul Mattick because he was a \"Council Communist\" (scare quotes), who, if you look for 5 seconds, is indeed a left communist, of the council communist variety, and you can even do some reading on the Internet Marxist Archive about him and others.\n\n[https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/subject\/left-wing\/index.htm](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/subject\/left-wing\/index.htm)\n\nUltra-Lefts like to lay claim to all of Left Communism and go by leftcom rather than ultras, partly to shake the derisive name, partly to sucker in those disillusioned with Lenininsts and those who have done a little reading on \"the communist left,\" and of course to lend themselves an air of legitimacy given that no one likes Bordigists and to leech off the efforts of the other leftcoms who oppose the centralization of power in the party apparatus and otherwise don't just want to be Leninists with a different name.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"So There's A Reason r\/leftcommunism is Dead\/Trash and Leftcoms May Get a Bad Rap Here"}

Now I'm going to focus on climate change, as other wise the dystopia I was brought up to be prepared for will actually happen, more so than one would hope. \n\nWhat avenues do we have available to communicate these ideas to those not typically interested. I am a production leader which might be looked down upon but we need people that are willing to organise more, so...\n\nThere is charity funding available for people trying to work towards a better world, some of this money could go towards publications, some sort of propaganda machine - it's not really propaganda if it has more truth. And of course having good communication skills to bring these topics into every day matters. Mixing with good old gossip\/comedy on those with power, trum is a great example. \n\n There is also video games, they are good at dissemination of ideas and themes. While development takes a bit of time depending on the complexity. Creating a game that doesn't try and force an ideology down you throat, but rather criticizes one humourously usually is received better, or too more acclaim. Giving people a larger platform to deliver a message.\n\nThen there film, a great way, most of my generation are watching things 20 minutes in length. criticizing ideology (the great dictator, Charlie Chaplin) works well, though can be twisted to an agenda easier. While the Day After Tomorrow is not a great film, it does show the chaos and destruction climate change will cause. Getting cinemas too show these sorts of films could help establish climate change back in the minds of everyday people. \n\nPosters and graffiti, the first doesn't have as greater of an effect on peoples daily lives, while graffiti can cause issues. Memes for posters attacking groups\/ideologies could be good as some of you disagree with IP laws. The internet is seen as a separate entity for a lot of people, bringing memes into the real world, could change perception.\n\nTor offers great democratisation of the internet, teaching people to use it for information at local libraries, as well as creating decentralised data centers like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit at these locations can help the spread of information on events, both political and, social and economical. There's also the fact we all agree with; that money controls power, crypto currency technology can work toward a better and more democratic politics, if your interested in this pm me. \n\nThe baby trump balloon was a great move, but we need more. We can't be reactionary, otherwise the glaciers will fall and we'll scream as our lungs fill up afterwards. \n\nHybrid cars and trucks aren't enough, we all know this. In my country there were a few governmental rebates for buying EV, but I think thats changed.\n\nWorking towards a home fully powered by renewables is incredibly important, and recycling is just as important. I'm currently working on a group of wind turbines for powering my father's workshop using only recycled materials.\n\n\nTldr: what can we do instead of talking about talking?\nI'm just trying to think of something, the people I have around me are in agreement though.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Current avenues for anarchists"}

{"author":"NikoTheEgoist","created_utc":1539840025,"num_comments":3,"score":1,"selftext":"The Liberation of the Individual and Society\n\nRevolution and Authority\n\n\u201cTo revolt is a natural tendency of life. Even a worm turns against the foot that crushes it. In general, the vitality and relative dignity of an animal can be measured by the intensity of its instinct to revolt\u201d\nMikhail Bakunin\n\nIf what Bakunin says is true, that strength is measured by the intensity of the instinct to revolt, then we are living in a society defined by weakness. Looking at the state of the first world, particularly America, we can conclude that a craving for independence and a strong will are traits that are frowned upon by those who lack them. From a very young age, children are taught that confrontation is bad, that conflict is bad, that we shouldn\u2019t be challenging; let me say this as franky as possible; it\u2019s all garbage. All life is characterized by conflict, by revolt. Conflict occurs when two opposing forces meet; good and evil, light and dark, life and death, liberty and authority, the individual and the state; In order for good to triumph over evil, for liberty to triumph over authority, their must be revolt, there must be struggle, for without struggle there can be no triumph. We could even go so far as to say that without revolt, there would be no existence, for, like life, existence is characterized by resistance and revolt. The disease that resists antibiotics becomes stronger and more able to flourish. The tree that has its roots firmly planted into the ground will resist being pulled from it by the storm. The man who resists life\u2019s attempts to tear him down will become stronger than ever before. \n\nHear I must clarify; I do not claim that all authority should be revolted against, I simply claim that all unjustified authority should be revolted against. Coincidentally, most authority we see in our society is unjustified. As Bakunin said, \u201cin the matter of boots, I defer to the authority of the bootmaker.\u201d You acknowledge the authority of the bootmaker on the subject of boots because he makes boots for a living; he knows what he is doing. But you would not go to the boot maker and ask him about the best farming methods, or how to make fishing rods. No sane man would ever say \u201cbecause the bootmaker knows how to make boots, he knows how to make all things; I bow before the all mighty authority of the bootmaker.\u201d But what makes the bootmaker a legitimate authority on boots? The fact that people can choose whether or not they regard him as an authority. Some people might think themselves the better authority on boots, and thus rely on their own knowledge when it comes to making boots. Though unwise, you could regard a fisherman or a farmer to be an authority on making boots, even though they do not know what they are doing. I would not recommend regarding said people as the authority on boots (that is, if you want boots that are comfortable), but you could, and you would have to live with the consequences of your decision (that consequence being bad boots). The point is, nobody is forcing you to acknowledge the authority of the bootmaker; you can choose to acknowledge him or not. The same goes for the authority of the scientist or the doctor; if you want to remain in good health, or stay educated about scientific matters, you should acknowledge the authority of the scientist or doctor, but you don\u2019t have to. The doctor doesn\u2019t hold you at gunpoint and force you to accept his services; but there is an organization that does. Nietzsche describes this organization as \u201cthe coldest of all cold monsters\u2026 everything it says is a lie, and everything it has it has stolen.\u201d This institution is known as the state.\n\nThe state; just thinking about it should make any decent man shiver with disgust. The state can produce nothing by itself, so, like a parasite, it latches on to those who are productive and sucks from them the fruit of their labor. It crawls deep into the mind and chants over and over again, \u201cyou need me. Without me you would be nothing.\u201d It repeats this so many times that many begin to believe it. But, in reality, the opposite is true. The state, if deprived of the individual, would be nothing. It would wither and starve. But the individual, if freed from the shackles of the state, would thrive. Because of this, the state must condition the individual to become reliant upon its services. It must, in every sense of the world, infantilize him, coddle him. It restricts his ability to own weapons, and thus restricts his ability to defend himself. It restricts the amount of hunting he can do each season, thus forcing him to rely on corporations and companies to provide his food for him. It restricts where he can go, because some places require that he has proper \u201cauthorization\u201d for him to enter. It limits what he can know, because some information is \u201ctop secret\u201d and \u201cclassified.\u201d It forces him to choose to either work for wages and be exploited by capitalism, become a capitalist and exploit others, turn to crime to support himself, or starve. If he wants to live off the product of his own labor, he must pay higher taxes. He cannot simply buy land in the middle of nowhere and opt out of the system, for if he wishes to fully own this land he must pay his mortgage or he will be evicted. Even if he pays his mortgage, he still has to pay property tax; if he refuses to pay, men with guns will break into his home and arrest him. The individual is not even allowed remain in his home without giving up the product of his labor to the state and\/or the capitalists. \n\nHow does the individual assert himself in a world such as ours? How does he live on his feet in a world where everyone lives on their knees? Through revolt. Through revolt he establishes his existence as a living, thinking being. Through revolt he takes control of his life and frees himself from the shackles of servitude. Through revolt, and only revolt, can the individual be free. It is ridiculous to ask your oppressors for freedom; it must be taken. The state does not have to be overthrown - simply disregarded. The state has its laws, its regulations, its taxes; in what way is the individual obligated to obey these laws and regulations, to pay taxes? He is in no way obligated. \n\nI am not saying that if an opportunity to overthrow the state arises it shouldn't be taken; on the contrary; all opportunities to overthrow, or at least weaken the state, should be seized immediately by the insurrectionist; all I am saying is that the overthrow of the state is not completely necessary - yet. But he who wishes to attempt such a revolutionary action must be warned; no good will come from overthrowing our current state and propping up a new one, for all governments, both republics and dictatorships, threaten the liberty of the individual. It must also be noted that nothing good will come from destroying only the government; the corporations must be destroyed as well, for in the absence of the state, corporate entities will become the state, and things will be no different; they would likely be worse.\n\nIndustrialization, Modernization and the Economy\n\nThe modernization of human life has done more harm than good when it comes to the amount of liberty individuals possess. We do not rely on ourselves and our own labor as much as we used to, rather, we rely on large corporations to grow and distribute our food; we rely on the government to keep us safe. We do not rely on our close friends and family as much as we used to. Rather, we rely on people we have never met before and likely won't ever meet again. I would go as far as to say that relationships and family bonds are much weaker today than they were in the past. Now, I must clarify; I am not suggesting that we rid the world of all technology; all I am saying is that we should not use technology to solve every problem; we should rely less on it and more on ourselves. There are many obvious benefits of technology, such as medicine, the printing press, sewing machines, the internet, and to some extent, automobiles (though it could be argued that the damage they do to the environment outweighs their usefulness). Though there are many beneficial technologies (such as the ones listed above), there are also many technologies that don\u2019t need to exist, like the majority of pesticides and fertilizers, nuclear power plants and the plethora of \u201csmart\u201d technology that plagues our society. There are also some technologies that we would certainly do better without, these being nuclear bombs and the majority of military technology. \n\nTechnology and existentialism may seem to have nothing to do with each other, but the opposite is the case; in our world, technology and meaning are intertwined. Our reliance on the industrial complex makes it more difficult for us to rely on ourselves and live happy lives. Rather than working for ourselves, most of us end up working for and being exploited by a boss who steals the products of our labor and uses them to generate profits for himself. Most of us don\u2019t choose what days we work or what times we work at. You are told to work for these days and for these hours, and if you, for some reason, are unable to work the way they want you to work, you are deprived of your job. In our world, most people are condemned to carry out tedious and repetitive tasks, turning them into mindless automatons. As said by Max Stirner, \u201ccondemning a man to machine-like labor amounts to the same thing as slavery. If a factory worker must tire himself to death twelve hours and more, he is cut off from becoming man\u2026 His labor is nothing taken by itself, has no object in itself, is nothing complete in itself; he labors only into another's hands, and is exploited by this other,\u201d (The Ego and its Own, 108).\n\nYou need look no further than the school system to see the unfairness of the capitalist system (I am not here claiming that public school is a capitalist institution; I am simply saying that the way wealth is distributed to the employees in a capitalist manner). In our school systems, the average principal is paid about $90,000 a year, whereas a teacher is paid about $55,000 a year (this may vary slightly depending on what type of school the teacher works at). \nNow, can someone explain to me why principals are paid nearly twice as much as teachers? Do the principals teach the students? Do they grade the papers? Do they plan the lessons? No, they do not. I am not saying that principals are unimportant; I am simply saying that in no world is the job of the principal more important than the job of the school teacher. Without principals, you could still have teachers, you could still have classrooms and you could still have schools; but without teachers, you can have none of these things. The same goes for the owners of a tech company and the technicians they employ, or owners of a farm and the men who plant the seeds and harvest the crops.\n\nBefore, man worked for himself and his friends. He made clothes because he chose to make clothes, because he was good at it, and because he enjoyed it. He chose what type of clothes he made and who he made them for. He chose how much he sold them for and who they would be sold to. He reaped the entirety of the profits; there was no boss who stole from him. Each individual owned a mean of production. This is the ideal economic system; a system based on both individual and collective ownership of the means of production, where lone individuals keep the entirety of the profits reaped from their labor, and where collectives equally distribute the profit they make to members. \n\nProperty\n\n\u201cProperty,\u201d said Emma Goldman, is \u201cthe dominion of man\u2019s needs, the denial of the right to satisfy his needs...property claimed divine right when it came to man with the same refrain as religion, \u2018Sacrifice! Abnegate! Submit!\u2019... he[man] has learned to see the insatiable, devouring, devastating nature of property, and he is preparing to strike the monster dead,\u201d (Anarchism and Other Essays, 9).\n\nWhen I speak of the evils of property, it must be noted that I am speaking of private property and not personal property or collective property. I believe it is necessary to explain what I mean when I say \u201cprivate\u201d \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201ccollective\u201d property. Here, private property is any property owned by someone who hires people to work on said property and pays them in wages. The wages of the workers are always less than the overall profit, and the capitalist (the owner of the property) always profits more than the workers. Personal property is property that is owned and used by an individual for purposes other than profit. Examples would be your house, clothes, or a toothbrush. Personal property, despite what many people think, can also be land. For example, if you own some land that you farm on and use the food to feed your family, that would be personal property. Even if you sold some of the extra produce, it would still be personal property, seeing that you are doing all the work yourself and aren\u2019t paying people to do it for you. If you hired people to work on your farm and paid them a portion of the profits they produced and kept the rest for yourself, that would be private ownership. \n\nSay that, instead of working on the property by yourself, and instead of paying people in wages to work on your property rather than working it yourself, you got some friends together and had them work on your farm with you and split the produce\/profits equally. This would be collective property, seeing that you and your friends both work on the farm and split profits equally. It is owned collectively because (as I will explain later) true ownership of property is determined by occupancy and use. \n    \nBased on this definition of collective property, it can be understood that private property is nothing more than property being stolen from its rightful owners (the people who use the property) by the capitalists (those who exploit the labor of the workers). It is like a man walking into your house and claiming that it is his house and that those who live in it must give him a portion of their income if they wish to continue living there, even though he doesn\u2019t pay any of the bills, does not assist in paying the mortgage or taxes, and does not help clean the house or make repairs to its infrastructure. \n    \nThe majority of libertarians on the right believe that private property is necessary for a society to be free. They claim that private property is necessary to resist the state. The opposite is true. The fact is, private property couldn\u2019t exist without a state to recognize its existence. Property lines mean nothing if there is no state to enforce them. Once the state is abolished, the illusion of private property will go with it, and ownership of land will be transferred to those who work it.\n\nRight wing libertarianism claims to recognize the sovereignty of the individual, but it does not; it recognizes the sovereignty of businesses and capitalists, not individuals. It gives the capitalist the power to claim sovereignty over individual through the institution of private property. This is no different than the state claiming sovereignty over the individual through the use of the legal system. As said by Josiah Warren, \u201cLiberty\u2026 is the sovereignty of the individual, and never shall man know liberty until each and every individual is acknowledged to be the only legitimate sovereign over his or her person, time, and property, each living and acting at his own cost,\u201d (Equitable Commerce, 21).\n\nCriminality and the State\n\nCriminals exist everywhere. In cities, suburbs and rural communities. Drug dealers, tax evaders, bank robbers and con-men. But who, or rather, what, is the most criminal institution to ever exist? The state. As said by Emma Goldman, \u201cnever before did the corruption, the complete rottenness of our government stand so thoroughly exposed; never before were the American People brought face to face the Judas nature of that political body, which has claimed for years to be absolutely beyond reproach, as the mainstay of our institutions, the true protector of the rights and liberties of the people,\u201d (Anarchism and Other Essays, 19).\n\nOn digging further into the subject, one will find that the entirety of the state is based not on justice, but on violence. But, of course, the state will never admit that it is a inherently violent institution. Rather, \u201cthe state calls its own violence law, and that of the individual, crime,\u201d (The Ego and its Own, find pg number). Only the state reserves the right to take lives, only the state reserves the right to kidnap and lock people up (and often for victimless crimes), only the state reserves the right to torture prisoners with the psychological horrors of solitary confinement. The police reserve the right to murder innocents and steal their property. Only the military reserves the right to invade foreign countries and slaughter their people. Emma Goldman hit the nail on the head when she said that the state \u201cis using the most drastic methods in dealing with the social offender. Why do they not deter? Although in America a man is supposed to be considered innocent until proven guilty, the instruments of law, the police, carry on a reign of terror, making indiscriminate arrests, beating, clubbing, bullying people, using the barbarous method of the \u2018third degree,\u2019 subjecting their unfortunate victims to the foul air of the station house, and the still fouler language of its guardians,\u201d (Anarchism and Other Essays, 53). \n\nSome may say that the state actually provides for a large percentage of the poor population, and that this fact justifies the state\u2019s reign of terror. This is not the case. Welfare is not the state giving its resources to the poor, it is the state giving a portion of what they stole from the poor back to them. The mass majority of people believe the state is good because of this, but the fools do not realize that they are only being given back a portion of what was stolen from them, and that the state only gives to them because it stole from them. But before it reaches the hands of the state, it reaches the hands of the capitalist. As I've explained, workers are paid in wages, which are always less than the profit produced by their labor, and a large portion of their income is kept by the capitalist. Then the state taxes the capitalist and takes a part of the money stolen from the worker by the capitalist. The state keeps most of this money, and gives a small portion back the the poor and working class. This creates the illusion of charity, when really, charity has nothing to do with it, because the state isn\u2019t giving up any of its property; it is returning property that it stole, not out of goodness, but because it makes the poor feel like the state is trying to help them, that it is their friend. This makes them less likely to revolt, it makes them more docile.\n\nAttaining Liberty\n\nIf we wish to liberate the individual and society, multiple things must be done; the general population must first become aware of the horrors of the oppressive hierarchies that currently plague them, and they must understand that the birth of liberty requires that these hierarchical structures are overthrown, or at least circumvented. Individuals must also learn to live their lives based on their own principles, and not to simply blindly follow principles created by others. The individual that is incapable of making his or her own meaning is incapable of being free. \n    \nIt is also vital that the libertarian left (social anarchists, mutualists, left individualists, socialists), set aside their differences with one another and unite under a common goal; the liberation of the individual, minorities, and the working class. Once this goal has been achieved, we can argue about the details; we can figure out if we want socialist markets or anarcho communism or syndicalism. Right now, those details do not matter. What does matter is uniting the libertarian left under a common goal. Until that happens, no change can be expected. Until that happens, tyranny will rule the earth.\n\n\u201cCrowned heads, wealth and privilege may well tremble should ever again the Black and Red unite!\u201d\nOtto Von Bismarck\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\nBakunin, Mikhail Aleksandrovich.

While it was true that things such as healthcare and housing became more accessible for the majority of the population and the lives of Afro-Cubans were improved, it does not excuse the undeniable fact that Cuba under Fidel is and was authoritarian and (still) oppresses the roughly \\~11 million people who live there.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom (who was no fan of capitalism or Batista) talks about periods of extreme rationing of food, (I know that a lot of it was because of the U.S. and the fall of the Soviet Union) where organizing in groups past a certain number of people was prohibited, (I think something like 10-20) where people were (and are) thrown in prison for writing or talking against the government, or at the very least lose their jobs. Dissent amongst school students, AKA not being an ardent supporter of the regime, can lose children their parent's jobs or even put them in jail. I don't know about now, but very high levels of surveillance were common in Cuba until at least until \\~1980 when my mom and my abuela left the country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCuba has ruling classes; the richest people are government officials. They exploit the general population of Cuba, and not anything an anarchist **should** be supporting. My family, who consisted of field hands, teachers, and small farmers, say that the Cuban government banned all labor unions except for those who are \"approved\" by the State. It is not even close to an equal society, especially where Fidel Castro (may that shithead rot in hell) was worth several hundred million dollars according to Forbes (just because they're capitalist shits doesn't make the information they're putting out incorrect). My mom's side of the family were all born in Cuba except everyone under \\~30, and I have been there 3 times in my life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just want to say that I what is now known as Cuba to be an anarchist society. I do not support capitalism in the slightest, and I do not support the Cuban state in the slightest. It makes me sad to see *anarchists* actually supporting authoritarian states. I hope I am just being paranoid and that people on anarchist subs don't actually support unity with people who support the idea of (any) states.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nP.S. Since I'm probably gonna be called a gusano\/a I'd like to say that my family proudly consider themselves that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr Fuck Fidel and all those *aprovechados*. Anarchists should not be supporting *any* states, especially authoritarian states. The liberation of say, Palestinians will not come through a nationalist state, only from an insurrection from below.

This is what I said when he justifed computer use by saying something to the effect of 'computers are ok because they were made by china which is communist', now I responded with \n\n\"even if China is technically communist. It is also an autocracy and should not be treated as an icon to strive for. Regardless of economic systems, there is no freedom of expression and speaking out gained the government can still get you arrested. It would be ignorant of us to act like just the state of being communist is superior. We can look at the devastation caused by the soviet gulags and see that just because they adopt the superior economic system on the surface inherently means that they are superior in general. Autocracy is still worse then Capitalism as far as who the real enemy is. Capitalism would be the secondary foe next to Autocracy and Fascism as far as im concerned\"  \n\n\nThis is generally accepted right? ","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"On the subject of China"}

Even before thinking of myself as an anarchist it never felt right to vote for someone I have never met to make decisions about a place they don't even live.

He also thinks the world is 8,000 years old and gay marriage is a part of satan's plan. I could go on but I don't think I need to... Now I find myself wanting to vote against him and vote for Beto. Not because I believe Beto is going to do what I would love to see (help dissolve the state..ha! a girl can dream) but because I want to see Cruz go away in defeat. I have never been a vindictive person, and I strive everyday to have compassion for everyone, but Cruz feels like the antithesis of my being and I want him to go away.

I'm having a crisis of conscience and such, jeez.\n\nSo, I've kinda lost faith in humanity's ability to relish anarchy and actually live well under its concepts. I mean, I don't actually think people are good-natured, cooperative, what is the opposite of spiteful?, enough to actually live with anarchism and for it to be any less of a hellhole than our status quo.\n\nAnarchism is the only developed political theory that is morally permissible however -- I can not morally condone states nor anything besides socialism --  but I've basically lost faith and optimism that more anarchism would solve more problems than it creates. Moreoever, I've lost faith that humans are well suited to ever install all that much anarchism into the systems that organize our lives and societies; it's just not in most people's nature, unfortunately.  They are sheep and authoritarians, most of them, I fear.  Which leaves me with the awful conclusion that for anarchy to ever be a big feature in modern life, it will ironically need to be *imposed on* so very many people who do not want it and will not warm up to it (because, as I said, they are moral authoritarians, they think it's \"good\" for \"good\" people to rule over \"bad\" people).  Am I wrong to believe that a critical mass of humans are devoted authoritarians who would risk their lives to fuck up someone else's anarchist society ? I don't think I am.\n\nSo that leaves me wondering about an oxymoronic anarchist dictator force (a benevolent one in my mind), and playing in my mind with how this institution would conduct itself.  What behaviors would they curtail by force? And would it make any sense at all to call the resulting society anarchist? (probably not).\n\nTL;DR Basically I just don't think any little anarchist society will be left alone and the authoritarians of the world would forever besiege it. Or alternatively, there would be authoritarian insurgents inside anarchist socieites, not allowing it to function.  And this makes me very sad.

It also shows how psychological corruption plays a role.  Here you'll mostly see how war was conducted for economic motivations, primarily because prior to the industrial evolution and the widespread implementation of mechanized labor and fossil fuels, humans were the most valuable and versatile industrial capital in existence.  If you were to follow this reasoning to where a conquered people's descendants grow as a population over the course of generations and gain some political foot hold, you can maybe see the origin of social classes, with a nobility (the conquerers and their descendants), and the peasantry (the conquered and their descendants).  From there, you could see how allowing them to keep some of their labor led to the idea of taxation, which is the portion that the conquerers demand.\n\nKeep in mind this is my own research and my own work, my own ideas, I don't expect anyone to be obligated to agree with me, and I'm open to conversation and learning new things, but getting snarky and insulting will make it far less likely I'm going to indulge your ideas.  Anybody that insults someone they've never met on the internet is intellectually suspect in my opinion.  Without further ado...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**The Primary Objective of War:**\n\nThe aim is not just to kill enemy, it is to force him to surrender his weapons and then the use him for some purpose.  Killing some of them may be unavoidable to achieve that objective.\n\nKilling as few as necessary to force the surrender is desirable because they are worth more alive than dead, considering that they can be useful if well managed.\n\nOnce captured, do not allow them to have weapons or to maintain a martial tradition.  Reward them for docility and subservience with pleasurable and pleasant things and punish dissent with pain, discomfort, and austerity to influence the politics among them.\n\nTreat those that embrace docility among them as their leaders, allow them to have a social order so that the docile ones are treated as authority figures.\n\nWhen the dissenters are gaining political traction among them, punish the docile ones and make it their responsibility to police the dissenters.  Show them respect for quelling the dissent, and only intervene and take action yourself when they fail, and only then punish the docile leaders, but no more seriously than to demonstrate your intentions.\n\nDo not hoard the labor of your captives.  Share their labor with those around you that you intend to influence.  This will entice them into supporting you so long as they do not become too wealthy and no longer need your goodwill.  Then you must be valuable by what you know and are capable of.\n\n**The Art of Generalship:**\n\nThe highest level of generalship is to achieve the objective without losing any men.\n\nBe careful not to disclose your methods and plans to anyone, despite that you believe you can trust them.  Make it worth their while enough to follow you and heed your advice and take direction by being successful while only telling them what they need to know to do their part.  This way they must collaborate after the fact to discern your methods.\n\nBy rewarding those that follow you by sharing your captives\u2019 labor as well as any material wealth you may gain by conquering the previous owners, by achieving your objectives without exposing your followers to great hardship or unnecessary danger, and by not providing even your closest followers with all of your methods and plans, you will become valuable to them as a leader.  They will then be less likely to dispose of you and your methods, adopt the attitude that discipline in following your commands is to their benefit because of past success, and that persisting in their efforts is worthwhile because of the expectation of rewards.\n\nAvoid engaging in fighting against an enemy\u2019s efforts to fight back unless he prevents every other alternative.\n\nAvoid attacking the enemy when he is awake if possible.\n\nIf he prevents you from attacking when he is not awake, avoid interacting with him such that he will prepare himself to fight when he sees your approach.  This will require great foresight and forethought, disguise, or indulging his foolishness.\n\nIf he will undoubtedly prepare to fight upon your approach, avoid being seen as you approach by either approaching from behind or using concealed avenues of approach.  It may be necessary to draw his attention away from the avenue of approach at least for the final closing of distance. This is the fundamental concept that underlies maneuver.\n\n**The Fundamental Strategies of Offense and Defense:**\n\nThe fundamental characteristic of an offensive strategy or action is to force a decisive engagement or to further develop it to a critical point once it has been initiated.  This assumes you possess some advantage, for example superiority in numbers.\n\nThe fundamental characteristic of a defensive strategy or action is to prevent or at least delay the enemy from doing the above.  This assumes you are at a disadvantage, such as inferior numbers.\n\nThe best way to defeat a hostile enemy is to fully encircle him, and then defend the encirclement and prevent escape.  This will only be effective if he cannot maintain adequate supply of potable water, food, or enough men awake to effectively defend his position, or if he can\u2019t hold out long enough for an effective rescue attempt to arrive from outside the encirclement.\n\nIf you can effectively encircle an enemy and by doing so cut them off from continuous supplies, as long as you can maintain the encirclement until they become vulnerable from dehydration, fatigue, hunger, weakness, distraction, or broken morale, you should have some hope to successfully negotiate their surrender, or if necessary attack them in a much weaker disposition.  To maintain and further develop the situation, it may be necessary to do so while you sleep.  This is the fundamental concept of the lieutenant.\n\nIf they are hesitant to surrender, assure them that the first among them to do so will be treated well, and the last will be tortured.\n\nThe fundamental objective of defense is the preservation of your people first, and the position or territory second.  If there are not enough people left to remain and continue to defend the land even after a successful effort to hold it against an attack, then holding the position is pointless. The territory or position is only valuable for its resources and access to lines of communication and supply from other positions and territories that it provides to the people.  The people cannot hold a position or territory if there are no people.  It is better to mobilize, survive and start anew in a new territory or position than to fight at a disadvantage and suffer losses for the sake of the land.\n\nIt is better to prioritize the prevention of losing people over the prevention of losing land.  Your people will be far more loyal to you knowing you value them over the land.  Treat the land and it\u2019s resources as necessary to sustain the people, not the people as necessary to sustain holding the land.\n\nBy prioritizing the prevention of losing people, you will be compelled to use methods to attack with the absolute greatest advantage for success by exposing your men to the enemy\u2019s vulnerabilities and not their strengths, and they will be in far less danger and more successful.\n\nKeep these methods secret to the best of your ability, and do your best to propagate the mindset that these methods are dishonorable and cowardly, and that doing the opposite of these things is brave and valorous, so that your captives and your enemies will be easily conquered and psychologically corrupted.  Encourage them to satisfy their ego by facing as great amount of danger as possible instead of as little as necessary, and to be hesitant to attack you when you are vulnerable for fear that they be seen as cowards.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Some Historical Context that Contributed to the Evolution of the Modern Social Order"}

I'm semi-panicking (hooray for anxiety).  Reason being is because before all of this (hell, even when Obama was in office), I had the occasional mushroom cloud nightmare out of nowhere and for some reason, those dreams really freaked me out.\n\nHowever, I'm trying to remain calm about it instead of allowing my mind to work over-time and worsen my physical health from stress and shit like that.\n\nI'm a millenial (born in 1989), so I was way too young to know what it's like to live during the Cold War.

Did you become numb to it after a while and such a paranoia became part of everyday life?  Did you know nothing would happen because all of the world leaders know that anyone pushing those buttons would lead to the fall of humanity in general?\n\nI'd go down the hall right now and ask my parents these same questions, but because they're Trump supporters, they're going to spend more time probably defending why their beloved Oompa-Loompa from Hell is doing this rather than educating me on how they lived with the threat of nuclear war dangling over their heads.\n\nWhat may bother me most is back during the Cold War, we had many close calls nearly brought about by smart people (I'm assuming) and other people were THANKFULLY listened to in order to divert from sparking a nuclear war, while these days we have a lot of pretty dumb people, so I'm not entirely sure if we're at higher risk now or if the risk is the same as before.  I mean, three decades have passed, and I've seen quite a few people have a shittier common sense and intelligence level as opposed to sometime ago (I could be wrong, but I am basing this off my personal experiences... even my parents have shown a significant drop in intelligence for some damn reason).\n\nDeep down, I just really hope this is some sick Halloween prank being pulled, instead.

This is the comment I left:\n\nWe buy what they make because we have literally no other choice. It's participate in capitalism, or starve and die. \n\nTo make an analogy, it is NOT the responsibility of the individual to buy less straws; it is the responsibility of the government to regulate those companies to make less straws in the first place. Thus, the onus is not on the consumer to make the change, but on the government to *force* the company to make that change. That, or just nationalize or forcibly shut down any company that emits over a certain amount of CO2 each year.\n\nMaybe the responsibility of the consumer is important to you Hank, but it misses the larger point that the corporations will never stop doing this, not even if we boycott.

{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1540490421,"num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"Here's a short typology of various economic forms that might help you navigate various economic discourse:\n\n-------Different kinds of \"exchange\": gift-exchange and market exchange:\n\nMarket-exchange is an exchange of alienable things between transactors who are in a state of reciprocal independence.\n\nNoncommodity (gift) exchange is an exchange of inalienable things between transactors who are in a state of reciprocal dependence.\n\nMarket exchange establishes objective quantitative relationships (prices) between the objects transacted, while gift exchange establishes personal qualitative relationships between the subjects transacting.\n\nGift exchange differs from barter or market exchange because the value of the gifts is judged qualitatively, not quantitatively as in the case of commodities. Gift-exchange is based on \u2018the capacity for actors (agents, subjects) to extract or elicit from others items that then become the object of their relationship\u2019.\n\nIn his famous book *Gifts and Commodities*, Christopher A. Gregory (an economic anthropologist) suggests this is a general tendency.\n\nGift economies tend to personify objects. Commodity\/market economies, do the opposite: they tend to treat human beings, or at least, aspects of human beings, like objects. The most obvious example is human labor: in modern economics we talk of \u201cgoods and services\u201d as if human activity itself were something analogous to an object, which can be bought or sold in the same way as cheese, or tire-irons.\n\nGregory lays out a tidy set of oppositions. Gifts are transactions that are meant to create or effect \u201cqualitative\u201d relations between persons; they take place within a preexisting web of personal relations; therefore, even the objects involved have a tendency to take on the qualities of people.\n\nCommodity exchange (market), on the other hand, is meant to establish a \u201cquantitative\u201d equivalence of value between objects; it should ideally be done quite impersonally; therefore, there is a tendency to treat even the human beings involved like things.\n\n-------Some non-exchange: Demand-sharing, pooling, \"everyday Communism\":\n\nIt's similar to what David Graeber calls \"everyday communism\", which he defines as:\n\n\"An open-ended agreement between two groups, or even two individuals, to provide for the other; within which, even access to one another\u2019s possessions followed the principle of \u2018from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs\u2019.\"\n\n\u2018from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs\u2019, the old communist formula, basically means if you have a need and I have the ability to meet that need, I do it.\n\nKeeping count or reciprocating is very frowned upon in these sort of situations.\n\nThis sort of communism is quite common (even under capitalism), in families, between friends and there's a little of it in every non-hostile relationship.\n\nWhat characterizes a sharing context comparatively is that it extends the circle of people who can enjoy the good implicated in a resource, for instance accessing a certain resource such as water. In other words, sharing food or drink is an action done for its own sake, putting the good of nourishment in the place of any specific goals that may be derivative of the transfer of food items, for instance the attempt to create obligations for the future. In this understanding, sharing is not a manifestation of an altruistic move, putting the goals of others above one's own goals, but rather one of renouncing derivative goals altogether in the face of intrinsic goods\u2014its intrinsic value if you will. In gift-giving contexts, by contrast, goals of various kinds (whether held jointly by the exchange partners or not, whether altruistic or egoistic) override the intrinsic good of whatever it is that is being provided.\n\nIt's important to distinguish exchange, which is usually for \u201cexternal\u201d and strategic benefits such as having a network of partners, creating obligations for the future, etc. (gift-exchange) or and more impersonal and violent benefits when it comes to market-exchange \u2013 from sharing that entails the intrinsic goods of receiving a share (sharing out) and of being accepted as a member of the community of humans with recognized needs (sharing in).\n\nUnlike what the economic fundamentalists would have you believe, sharing is not governed by either ecological need and pressure nor a diffuse notion of generosity and altruism. The ethnographic record shows that sharing takes place not only under conditions of scarcity, and that it typically takes the form of demand sharing rather than apparently generous gift-giving. In fact, a number of cultural conditions have to be in place for sharing to work. Unlike the case of exchange systems, these conditions are not formally institutionalized normative systems but, instead, complex systems of habitual practice. In the ethnographic cases (including those in capitalist societies), sharing works because people have a shared history of mutual involvements as kin, because they master numerous ways of initiating sharing through implicature and other forms of talk, and finally because they recognize the presence of others as the (often silent) demand that it constitutes toward those who have and who are in a position to give.\n\nMany acts of sharing took place, and continue to take place, because they are initiated by the taker and social strategies are in place that decouple giving from receiving. Sharing may therefore take place (as said before) without the provider enacting and expressing charity. Often it takes place in a way that downgrades the act of giving as part of leveling any potential attempts of the giver to take political advantage from his or her economically advantaged position. Demand sharing not only inverts the sequence of action but also the tone of the transaction that is known as \u201ccharitable giving.\u201d There is no sharing without a demand. The demand need not be uttered, and it need not be the demand of a specific interlocutor since it is a demand for provisioning that emerges as a consequence of moral role relationships or as incurred by a particular situation of copresence, as I would prefer to call it. We need to recognize that one\u2019s mere bodily presence, underlined by addressing the other person in particular ways, is always a demand for being acknowledged as a partner, a personal being with legitimate needs. An appropriate definition of demand sharing is therefore much broader than the use of explicit demands such as \u201cGive me . . .\u201d leading to the appropriation of what one may think one is entitled to. The explicitness of the demand may differ and it may be entirely implicit very much like a \u201csilent demand\u201d. Humans are sufficiently able to put themselves into the situation of others to be able to know what the intrinsic goods of shared objects are for fellow humans without any demand being uttered.\n\nSharing is generally characterized by the preparedness to suspend measuring objects against one another (which means that sharing does not necessarily entail that everyone gets the same) in that situation and by the unwillingness to hang on to something in a particular situation.\n\nYou can read more about this in Thomas Widlok's book \"Anthropology and the Economy of Sharing\": https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Anthropology-Economy-Sharing-Thomas-Widlok\/dp\/1138945552\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"What's a Market (Commodity-exchange), What's a Gift (Gift-exchange) and What's a Share (Demand-sharing, non-exchange)?

{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1540597050,"num_comments":12,"score":5,"selftext":"The title is only half clickbait.\n\nYes I've seen it said that imperialism is just a paper tiger. That the people united will never be defeated. And beyond the realm of idealistic (and outdated) political slogans we know that even they are subject to the laws of ecology, economy, etc. and are subject to collapse at any time.\n\nHowever. The entire dream of anarchism, socialism, and really any sort of anti-capitalist ism (I don't know what tendency I really am; I just post here because I'm still banned from r\/socialism) is that they can be overthrown. The more liberal among that sphere look to non-violence, mass movements, direct action and so many types of heady idealism. The orthodox Marxists look to violent revolution as an instrument of Hegelian dialectic, the Maoists dream of Protracted People's War with a fervor approaching the religious. But all believe it can be done.\n\nCan it tho?\n\nWe could do it 200, 100 years ago when the best they had were national militaries that didn't want to fire on their own people (nearly every successful revolution has involved the military switching sides). Those militaries had basic machine guns and were still largely mounted cavalry at the time. Even after the Second World War, when the more violent tendencies lost the technological advantage and had to retreat to guerrilla warfare with surplus AK-47s, the gap wasn't that big. And on the non-violent side we had strikes, a strong labour movement and non-violent direct action that principally worked to initiate and then drag out high-profile legal cases that (hopefully) ended in new rights for all. For both the violent and non-violent tendencies these tactics haven't evolved much to this day, even with social media now involved.\n\nThe bourgeoisie tho? They control the media, which in the age of the internet includes social media. Inherent in the use of all social media (hell, the use of most of the internet given the necessity of email) is surveillance. Period. The Panopticon isn't a prison. It's both a playground and the prime sphere of a large part of our social and economic interaction, so we can't really afford to be left out. When this tool is coupled with the inherent shallow sensationalism of social media, the predicative policing algorithms and the likes of Cambridge Analytica, we have a three-pronged tool to track and neutralize all resistance before it begins. This thread and all like it are playgrounds that they pay no mind to because they know we are absolutely harmless. If we posed any minute threat to the current order, it'd be gone in a heartbeat on charges of sedition and fostering terrorism.\n\nIn meatspace we have the older tools of policing and the military. They are much stronger now, and not only because of the internet. The United States Military is the single most powerful ever to exist, and a large part of it exists as a reaction to 20th century anticapitalism. If you want to quickly sum my position: we have signs and graffiti, they have fucking nukes. They will not side with us if we ever pose a credible threat. They will fire on us. They already have. In the United States at least (and probably the entirety of NATO and the G20), a successful revolution would mean either defeating, neutralizing or converting them. That happens in poorly-written Hollywood movies. It will not happen in reality. And remember, they have the internet at their disposal now. If they ever manage to unlock the secrets of quantum computation, they will simultaneously break what little encryption we do have while making their own nearly impenetrable.\n\nThe populace has their consent manufactured by the media, which in our time is tailored to their respective political-cultural tribes. I don't need to spell that out, do I?\n\nSo my worry is this. As climate change gets worse, people will get more desperate - the bourgeois not quite as much, but definitely them too. Everyone's resource base is going to shrink, and the bourgeois will protect their hoard to the death. And as the world class-stratifies from the migrations, the xenophobia, the agricultural breakdown and sea-level rise, some movements will materialize out of them to take that hoard. Maybe they'll even be socialist, degrowth, whatever. All the things we'd want to see in such a movement.\n\nViolence will ensue. Perhaps on a scale never seen in human history.\n\nMost will be collateral and at the hands of the powerful. But they will have no qualms about it. Personally they will - there will be many sleepless nights, depressions and suicides in their ranks - but they are not individuals, they are emergent social organisms. Emergent social organisms in our species are almost fundamentally amoral when dealing with others, without fail. *Any and every measure that will not harm themselves as collateral, they will take*. All weapons, if deemed \"safe enough\" to use, will be used. Genegineered plagues, aerial or orbital bombardment, mass starvation, the whole shebang.\n\nThey can stop us before we start. And if they start, they will kill us. We have signs and masks, they have guns. We have guns, they airplanes. We have a mountain stronghold, they have satellites and nuclear weapons. Insert all of cyberpunk here.\n\nAnd when they do eventually collapse due to resource and climate stress, it won't be a great equalizer. Their hoards will shrink, but they'll still be there, and they will fight to the death to defend them. Insert any number of speculative neo-feudal scenarios with your preferred taste of collapse aesthetic here.\n\nAt least, that's how it seems to me in my darker moments.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm not a nihilist - yet anyways. Hopefully I never get there. I can't not do anything; I feel some moral compulsion in me to do it. But anything I can do will never be enough, and all I can do will be either neutralized, reversed or crushed.\n\nSo how then should we live in the era of the insane?","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Is the bourgeoisie now invincible?"}

{"author":"BeefCurtainsJohnson","created_utc":1540680773,"author":"BeefCurtainsJohnson","created_utc":1540155608.0,"num_comments":2,"score":7,"selftext":"So here's something I've been working on: The optimal method of conducting a strategically offensive operation is to encircle the enemy and defend the encirclement from the outside such that the enemy within cannot escape.  If the encirclement is not a large area within which the enemy can maintain continuous supplies of food and water to an effective degree, eventually he will be forced to either attempt a breakout, be rescued from an outside friendly force, or surrender his weapons and accept whatever consequences come with that.\n\nSo the next question is, what if you encircle him, and he has enough supplies to make it disadvantageous to wait him out?  What if a friendly relief effort is expected to arrive before then and complicate the situation?  Is there another way to attack him with minimal resistance?  Generally the concept of maneuver is based around getting an element in position to strike from an undefended approach where there is little or no risk of danger as there would be from attacking from the direction in which he can effectively fight back.  Typically this requires either surprise or numerical superiority and effective maneuvering to get one of your elements behind one of his elements that isn't supported from that approach and make the initial assault, then take the assault to the element that the previous element was supporting, etc.  The only way he can prevent that is by fully enclosing an outward facing perimeter, and if you keep your encirclement intact so that he can't escape the situation will not develop further.  At that point, the maneuver phase on the larger tactical level isn't so much the focus even if there are lower level tactical maneuvers still be conducted.  So how can you get an advantage from that situation?\n\nHere's how.  Since you can no longer intitiate the assault from behind one of his units, you can still gain an advantage by timing your assault either to when their sleep rotation has the fewest of them awake, or if their solution is to sleep less, to use the sleep disruption or deprivation as a means to engage them when there effectiveness is diminished.  \n\nLet's use an example: Studies show that people tend to be most productive and effective on 7.5 to 8 hours of sleep.  The more they are deprived the less effective they are.  Even a small deprivation, if maintained over a long period, and widespread among the entire force, will be detrimental to their communication and organizational cohesiveness, and their morale.  So knowing this, it should be considered optimal to keep troops well rested to maintain the most effective fighting force.  \n\nSo let's call it 8 hours per 24 hours for each soldier.  Let's start with the premise that we want to keep equal strength at all times, so that would mean that for every three soldiers, one should be getting rested for next duty day\/assignment\/watch at all times.  So technically, you actually have 2\/3 of your force that is functionally effective at any given time.  Now let's say there's a critical situation, and you need all hands involved.  So you have everyone awake and involved at the same time, or at least some of those that would be normally getting sleep on some assignment for just a few hours.  That means that they'll have to push their sleep time into overlapping with other's sleep time, which means you will have a period of decreased numerical strength, or alternatively you'll have to push back everyone's sleep time and deprive the entire force of sleep, thus eventually reducing the effectiveness of your entire force in order to maintain your numerical force.  If you're familiar with Lanchester's Laws, you may see why this is tempting. \n\nObviously, if the enemy has the same problem, you can use this against him.  If you can harass him enough to commit all or most of his force at any one given time, and just not fully engage him and expose yourself to the danger of his fighting effort for want of a better later opportunity, he will eventually either have to overlap his sleep rotation, reducing his effective numerical strength, or he'll have to push back the sleep rotation of the entire force, and decrease the effectiveness of his entire force.  Either of these are advantageous.\n\nAll of this leads to an interesting conclusion: The need for static defensive positions is actually less motivated by access to resources of food and water, because it's possible you could essentially continue moving and find those in multiple locations, but 1\/3 of your force needs to be asleep at any given time to maintain steady numerical strength around the clock and a force that is as well rested and effective as possible.  This means that some part of the 2\/3 or your force that is awake and active must be employed in defending the rest position, and that will depend on the size of the position, the approaches, etc.  So really, less than 2\/3 of your force can really be involved in offensive operations without creating a following lull where you will have decreased effective numerical strength or a less rested and effective force.\n\nLong story short, if you manage your sleep rotation, and keep the fighting far enough away from your rest position for your force to get quality sleep, while you disrupt the enemy's sleep rotation, and keep the fighting as near as possible to their rest position, even if they are at the moment maintaining a defensive perimeter and preventing ideal offensive maneuver options, you can still gain an upper hand in either numbers or effectiveness over a relatively short amount of time, maybe 2-3 days.","subreddit":"MilitaryStrategy","title":"Military Sleep Rotations, Exhaustion, Functional Numerical Strength, and Timing of Attacks""num_comments":0,"score":6,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Military Sleep Rotations, Exhaustion, Functional Numerical Strength, and Timing of Attacks"}

A yearning to live truly free, and the doubt that we ever  will.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut more than anything, a boiling, seething,  all-encompassing, rage. An anger that makes me grind my teeth and shake.  An anger that it takes all of my willpower to control.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt was a  matter of \"when\", and not \"if\". If you believed something like this  couldn't happen in today's America, then you were deluded. We have a  rich tradition of racism, anti-Semitism, and all other forms of  anti-minority violence in this country. Jews have been the targets of  harassment, exclusion, and violence throughout our history here, and  this is just the latest in a long line of actions taken against us for  existing. Trump's rise and election, enabled by the GOP, has emboldened  hate groups from coast to coast, but they have always existed here -  destroying Indigenous populations, enslaving, excluding, and lynching  Black Americans, murdering, framing and imprisoning Jews.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n While Jews are not a monolith - we have a wide spectrum of political  and religious opinions, and cultural\/ethnic diversity - if you're a Jew  who sided with the current administration even as it spouted racist and  anti-Semitic dogwhistles to embolden white supremacists, then you're  just as bad as them. You're a Kapo and I will shame you until the day I  die. You're a traitor, and a coward. You might believe that those in  power think you're \"one of the good ones\", but know this: when the time  comes, you'll be the first they take out to the firing squads. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n As many people who've seen me grow up know, there was a period of time,  from high school through most of college, where I tried pretty hard to  ignore my identity as a Jew. I did my best to forget my heritage,  divorce myself from my culture, and forget about the past that I will  always be inextricably linked to. But as most of my current friends also  know, I didn't stay that way. I learned more about the progressive  Jewish politics of my grandparents: who at times when it was certainly  not convenient helped fight for women's rights, against poverty, and for  the rights of LGBT people. I found comfort in old secular traditions at times  when I was feeling low: lighting the Hannukiah, cooking traditional  foods, communing with others like me. And I began to read more about the  radical political history of our people: the radical Yiddish poets,  journalists, philosophers, and fighters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the last several  years I've come to the realization that there is no shame in being who  my history compels me to be. It might not be fate, but it feels like it.  I don't believe in destiny, but this is as close as I'll get. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI  am a proud Jew. I am a proud radical Anarchist Socialist and  Anti-Fascist. I know at my core who I am now. I know that my Jewish  values align with others under the boot of oppression. I will not be  free until everyone is free. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTimes of sadness,  grief, and anger historically are times of bonding for our people. We  come together to mourn, to console, and to cry. We come together to  scream at the heavens or pray. But historically, we've also used the  times of our greatest sorrow to release our historical anger by  organizing. By fighting those in power. And by knowing that we alone can take control of our future. I'm not talking about Zionism. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm  talking about the Maccabees, I'm talking about the self-defense forces  in Shtetls of Europe, I'm talking about the Jewish Labor Bund and their push for an egalitarian Yiddish diasporism (*Doikayt*), I'm talking about  the resistance fighters who put bullets in Nazi hearts, I'm talking  about the famous Jewish Anarchists here in the US, and I'm talking about  all of the current Jewish groups fighting for global human rights and  against all injustices. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-----\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGiven the events of  yesterday, and our emotions in their wake, now is the time to organize  as our forebears did. Let us channel our sadness, our grieving, and our  anger. Let us link arms and protect our communities together.

Like the mosque shooting in my country, it appears that the one that just happened in Pittsburgh will just become another fart in the wind for every day life. Those real people who survived even harder conditions than us, are gone and they take with them the stories and experience which are the basis for us to say \"never again\". It's not like I ever know the victims in these shootings but somehow it feels like someone or something has been taken away from me.

To know that underneath whatever deceptive calls for unity come from fascists and the ruling class there will be more death and violence is like staring into a bottomless pit.\n\nYou think this kind of appeal to sanity would work but it just seems like the comment sections and fascist movements speak for themselves. I'm not afraid of them as an individual and I would trade my life for someone else if it came to it but how real this has all become is just too much. Compound the idea that we're living in the midst of climate change destroying the world, capitalists are scrambling for whatever pieces of the pie they can get, and we are so numb to negative news that we'd much rather live in bliss and ignorance.

I hope that none of you will be in danger, and that no one you know and care about is in danger.\n\n**PRACTICAL** **THINGS** **TO** **DO** **RIGHT** **OW**\n\n1: get a VPN that has servers that the brazilian government can't subpoena. delete your social media accounts that you've used that have leftist and pro PT stuff on them. Make sure that going forward nothing is traceable to you. Any new media accounts you have that are political must be tied to a dummy email account.\n\n2: if you have the means, keep a stash of money in a very safe place that's hidden but accessible. If the worst happens and you ever have to leave the country, you'll need bribe money. You'll need documents and authoritarian regimes don't always make it easy for certain people to get them. also keep a few gold rings hidden too. They're valuable everywhere you might end up.\n\n3: get a passport now. get all those documents now. even if you don't plan to leave, get them right fucking now so you can be processed elsewhere and you'll be let on a flight if you need to go before the option might vanish. Keep copies in a bank box if your country's banks are reliable. Keep digital scans in an encrypted thumb drive. The digital scans can be used to get real copies at a brazilian embassy or consulate if your government is willing to still provide them to you.\n\n4: if you take medication, keep careful track of your prescriptions. Always make sure that you have a 2 month supply that you can take with you. You might not be able to get the exact same meds in another country due to differences in regulatory approval for certain active ingredients and their approved applications, and it might take time to get a replacement drug in a host country.\n\n**MENTAL** **HEALTH**\n\nYou're scared and angry. Maybe not necessarily for yourself even, but for others. That's good. That means you're still sane. That also means you're feeling a lot of alienation because you're surrounded by people who see nothing wrong with what is going on around you. It will get worse. That feeling will grow and fester. If you have empathy, you can never turn it off completely. You will feel like a stranger in your own country until this is over. Already you and people you care about have been demonized. Loan wolves, groups, and the state may all act on that demonization. Right now you may not even be sure what you can do and if you should even try to do anything. That's normal. But you have until January to decide what you do, and if you become a private person to try to protect your own safety, or if you decide to stay and become a public person to help others and yourself. If you can't be brave, then be kind. If you can't put yourself out there, and I'm not saying you should, then do what you can quietly until you can't bare it anymore and you have to leave. But until you decide how you're going to respond, you will feel alienated. If you ever feel numb, then you're loosing your humanity. You're going to have find a confidant. Maybe it's your spouse, maybe it's someone else in your life like your best friend. very few people can bare the emotional burden you will feel when it all kicks off and never say anything. You will need to talk to people, and you need to know they won't betray you if it gets extremely extremely bad. You will also feel anger. That's also normal. But quash it if you can. Anger can make you do reckless things. You will get your revenge by living and not conceding to the madness around you. You need to be smart. Assume that lists of names are being assembled. You can no longer speak out so openly. Make sure you know who you're talking to and who's listening.\n\n \n\nTake care. No matter how bad it gets, remember that there are people who care deeply about you. You're never as alone as you might think you are. I've been asked in DMs about VPNs. Here's a great article that explains a lot about the pros and cons of some reputable major ones out there. I personally recommend NordVPN \"  ~ Via \/u\/adlerchen\n\nTips from other users:\n\n-If you have a Portuguese grandparent, you are eligible for citizenship. via \/u\/AimingWineSnailz\n\n-In regards to VPNs I would recommend Mullvad over NordVPN. One indicator that might be a good idea is that NordVPN does this (taken from OP's article):\n\n&gt; We use Google Analytics and third-party ticket\/live chat tools (Zendesk\/Zopim). Google Analytics is used to improve our website and provide our users with the most relevant information. The ticket\/live chat tool is used to provide the best support in the industry (available 24\/7), but not tracking our users by any means.\nI mean, they don't even bother with shielding their users from fucking Google...\n\nMullvad meanwhile:\n\n&gt; We have no external elements at all on our website. We do use an external email provider; for those who want to email us, we encourage them to use PGP encryption which is the only effective way to keep email somewhat private. The decrypted content is only available to us.\nWay better. That's not to say that NordVPN isn't decent a choice though!\n\nIf you can't afford a VPN subscription and need a free VPN go with ProtonVPN.\n\nAlso mail! Please change to something like either tutanota or protonmail.\n \n~ Via \/u\/Sartanen\n\n-**Recommended** **email** **providers:**\n\n[Tutanota](https:\/\/tutanota.de\/)\n\n[Riseup](https:\/\/riseup.net\/)\n\n[Protonmail](https:\/\/protonmail.ch\/)\n\n**Regarding** **VPNs:**\n\nThe VPNs you will purchase most likely offers non-Brazil locations. Use them, not the ones located in Brazil. Can't afford a VPN? Use [Tor](https:\/\/torproject.org\/). Can afford a VPN? Use Tor still. Most of these services are available with a dedicated .onion address which are more secure than the clearnet one.\n\n**Secure** **payments**\n\nAvoid using credit cards\/bank accounts\/etc for purchasing a VPN or other things you prefer to keep discreet whenever possible. Get Bitcoin or other currencies instead. Simply buying bitcoin from someone is usually enough, however for extra security you can tumble the coins using [Privcoin](https:\/\/privcoin.io\/) or other coin mixers.\n\nCheck out [PrivacyTools.io](https:\/\/www.privacytools.io\/) for more tools and tips for security.\n\nhttps:\/\/0bin.net\/paste\/2oF2qNpVf8mNFqu8#B-iER4pDBL8qgc+iiUc9klwrcazlgK1bxPMMlASeOXx link to reddit post source code\n\n~ Via \/u\/Codefuser","subreddit":"communism","title":"Life and survival guide for Brazilian comrades.""num_comments":1,"score":18,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Life and survival guide for Brazilian comrades."}

I lost my job, didn't pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won't release it.\n\nI was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (I'm not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest I didn't even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something I did not do). I had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where I was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. I'm not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn't say anything I told him to at this appearance I had because a simple background check shows I don't have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened I was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). He literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (Judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).\n\nSo then I sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. I tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper I had but he was never in and never came to see me. I couldn't afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. I don't really have family or super close friends to call for help, I was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because I can't pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months I'm about to owe.\n\nWhen he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the DA who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter I mailed them until then also. After that appearance I got a \"sorry, computer error you are free to go\" and I was released.\n\nWhat can I do for any of this? Apparently someone with the same name but a different DOB shot a building after a fight and is a felon but I sat in jail, lost my job, can't even get my car back they say unless I pay some crazy fees (how am I liable for these fees if it was a error?!). This is in Madison, Wisconsin\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies guys and gals, I'll contact the Wisconsin branch of the ACLU tomorrow and see what they say and where to go from here. Also I appreciate the messages offering to help me if I need it but I can kinda survive frugally on my credit cards if absolutely need be and will be contacting my boss tomorrow also and explaining the situation.\n\nEDIT 2: To clear up more confusion about my car. The city had it towed by a local company they are contracted with. The storage fees are $1900 and growing daily and I only paid $3500 for the car 2 years ago. The towing company that has my vehicle told me the city can waive their percentage and pay the rest to them and I can get my car but told \"good luck\". Also their policy is to only store the vehicles for 90 days before auctioning the car.","subreddit":"legaladvice","title":"I was arrested, kept in jail for 62 days and then released after the DA finally got around to my case.

I have a friend who is living there, and already (months before Bolsonaro's swearing in) she is living in terror. Family supported him, many of her friends are too poor to leave the country, she's already witnessing police raids on college dorms, violence against minorities, and the pro-dictatorship, militaristic hysteria that a large part of her city is manifesting.  \n\n\nI saw a survival guide posted on r\/ChapoTrapHouse for people stuck living under the impending fascist regime, and one of the segments that I think was most poignant is the importance of secure digital communication; the use of VPNs was emphasized.  \n\n\nMy question is in the specifics of this issue, as (aside from some very elementary basics) I know very little about this subject. From a bit of research, I glean that, as one would expect, some VPN providers are more trustworthy than others, some keep more logs than others (even among those that claim to keep \"no logs,\" as they can mean different things)... What I want to know is what VPN providers-- ideally cheap or free-- are trustworthy and secure enough to trust when you're using them in an actual 21st century dictatorship? One which cannot be subpoenaed by his government?   \n\n\nShe is not a political activist necessary, and she's no techie, but she is very opposed to and threatened by Bolsonaro's state and anything simple that can protect her ability to access information privately and\/or communicate without serious fears would make a huge difference. Other suggestions besides VPNs are welcome, but I'm hoping for simple ideas that have a high certainty of efficacy (I don't want to give her any advice that ends up biting her in the ass, because obviously the consequences could easily be dire). Anyone who really knows what they're talking about, your advice is greatly appreciated.   \n\n\nThanks!  \n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Internet Privacy\/Security Under Fascism (VPN) Question-- Please Help."}
