It has ideas above its station, which means it must be an all-encompassing top-down hierarchy of contradictions (how can it have ideas above its station if it's also a top-down thing, usually government or religious, but also multinational corporation). \n\nJust like I'm doing right now. Please take this with a sprinkle of salt on your tin foil hat, bite down and taste the pickle cause I'm going in dry. \n\nAmerica has two deep states. One of them is your favourite enemy, top posts here spotlight them often enough that I'm expecting him to be on Broadway by the end of the month. This deep state really highlights the Minority Problem America has, as it has to try twice as hard to get half the recognition. And *a deep state really is a minority*, the interests of the 1%. Not even the humans themselves, punchable faces with big hearts the lot of them. The capital (as in money) itself has interests that can be seen throughout history. The rich can have all the bleeding hearts and open wallets in the world, they can't actually stop the momentum of the huge wealth pile they're all sitting on. \n\nThe interests of Big money in the USA has two faces, the first of which tries real hard. They're top-of-their class Ivy-League Schools grads working at some of the highest public institutions of the United States, believers in the sacred oaths of their Republic, shed tears at flags. The best of the best, the brightest minds you haven't shot into space are pounding the pavement in these informal groups that don't need names cause it's all hush hush. The First Deep State is a network of know-nothings, who will deny it ever happened, not that there was anything wrong with what didn't happen. But this secrecy is in part what keeps them down, unable to actually lead the country. If they could operate more openly they'd be more effective, but also bigger targets. \n\nIt takes the best and brightest, operating under the harsh conditions of zip it, with an offical budget of nil, unceasing-unsleeping nights of laying awake and stolen naps under the desk at workday, their very **damndest** not to let all their progress slip backwards. And then they still have to do their dayjobs. It really makes you feel for them, almost, until you remember they're working for an unfeeling block of money. I'd salute them, but I can't wipe the shit-eating grin off my face (and I'm an anarchist). \n\n\\#2. Number Two of the Deep State twins is someone you do not want to fight. Where as his brother is the working hard to get next to nothing done, this one is a drooling idiot with incredible luck whos biggest victories *landed in his lap*, which upset him cause they woke him up from his nap. Poor baby, except not a baby, it's the informal network of traitors and spies that make up the elected officials of the US Government (and its smaller subsidaries in each and every state). You can't really make this side angry, it's not a coherent network so much as a transient one that exists from moment to moment. There is no institutional memory here, unless there needs to be, holding a feud for example. This Deep State Twin will sometimes receive the profit resulting from the hard work of the other, but never the punishments (because that's what whipping boys are for). \n\nLike a diaper, this side of the deep state needs to be changed every so often, but you have [two parties both full of shit](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/7phm5nm49qm01.jpg) (this image sparked my thoughts on the subject, thanks Mr. Hitlerstache). USCongress can't be arrested for insider trading, so they must of course be near the top of the list when it comes to the *whos who* of that industry. This side of the Deep State Twins is stupidly open, very public facing (it can't hide its hands, it's the government). We can see campaign donations from the big names of the marketplace, Telecom Companies that might as well be TV Networks, Defence industries that meet the demands of global instability, Walmart. They are always getting caught doing stupid shit behind closed doors, and in the middle of guys in the airport bathroom. The press makes them a laughingstock, and the press then tears out its own hair in a fit and completes their suicide pact (because the press is also in service of Capital). \n\nThis side is chosen by the American People, who hit rock bottom for stupidity and dug deeper so they could export it to Canada. They are very proud of it, and will babble about it contentedly like children do for their adorable mess. Very nice, no don't show your mother. \n\nThis side makes laws, which is part of why you don't want to piss it off, but also because since it's also the public face of a deep state (Government in Service of Big Money not the Publics Interests) you'll not only get arrested but everyone will know about it too. Embarrassment ignores even the hardest armour, penetrates the mind and then decides it likes it here and wants to stay. \n\nThe Deep State Twin made up of elected officials will lie to your face, which is what you want in a politician but not what you should select them for. They will turn on a dime (to pick up a dime) and then lie about what they said before (still in service of the almighty dollar), which is what I mean when I say that this twin doesn't have a memory. The Library of Congress is good at their jobs, librarians all over the world dream of working there and wake up to change their sheets. Is it hot in here or is it just me? \n\nI hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it (I'm *sooo funny* when I'm high). Please hurl at me your favourite invectives, slurs and accuse me of anything you want, even jaywalking.

Rather than fighting tooth and nail against conditions of exploitation,  oppression and ecological devastation, we often instead find ourselves  mired in an endless cycle of argument, critique and debate. But while  theory can and should play an important role in informing our actions  and helping to build relationships based in trust and mutual  understanding\u2026 at the end of the day, any meaningful practice of  collective autonomy requires the capacity to actually defend territory.\n\nThough they often draw inspiration from one another, struggles for  territorial autonomy \u2013 if they are to be successful \u2013 must be based on  local realities. After all\u2026 defending a physical space means fighting  where we stand. And so the battle to defend a squatted social center in  an urban neighbourhood will necessarily look very different from one  waged by Indigenous land defenders against the encroachment of pipeline  companies through their territories. But though these struggles may  assume different forms, they stem from a shared resolve to draw a line  in the sand and to defend it\u2026 come what may.\n\nIn this month\u2019s episode of Trouble, subMedia showcases three ongoing  land defence struggles: the Unist\u2019ot\u2019en Camp, located on the unceded  Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territories of so-called \u201cBritish Columbia\u201d; the autonomous  spaces movement in Ljubljana, Slovenia and the eco-defence occupation  known as La ZAD, in Notre-Dame-des-Landes, France.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Trouble # 14: Fighting Where We Stand"}

I need your help, I mean my whole town really really needs your help.\n\nThe Vice Mayor of my town, Dixon California, went full tilt bigot recently and decided to publish an article in the town\u2019s newspaper. In this article he called to make July  **\"Straight Pride American Month\"** and called gay men **\"faries\"** *(and yes everyone, the Vice Mayor did, in fact, misspell it)*. \n\nNow, I think this is abhorrent. The vast majority of Dixon thinks it\u2019s abhorrent. However, city hall just wants to wait for it to blow over. The citizens of Dixon are already calling for a recall of the Vice Mayor, however, the Mayor and city council don\u2019t want to go through the trouble of a recall election. They just want to wait until November so that *\u201cnature can take its course\u201d*.\n\nWell, you know what, I don\u2019t want nature to take its course. I feel that we shouldn\u2019t sit back and treat the Vice Mayor like any other disgraced politician. The Vice Mayor used an LGBT slur *(and fucking misspelled)* in a column of a newspaper he co-owns. If the people of Dixon and the LGBT community don\u2019t do something, what does that say about us? That we accept slur\u2019s as normal? that we tolerate our elected officials abusing their power to belittle others? Most importantly, are we going to allow them to make us feel unwelcome in our own communities?

I'm trying to keep the list contemporary and accessible; while I'd love to recommend *The Conquest of Bread,* I think my mates might find Kropotkin a bit dry, and it's the first thing many self-declared anarchists read, anyway.\n\nHopefully in this post we can share each other's favourite anarchist works!\n\nOf course, **Noam Chomsky**'s *Understanding Power* is a must-read for your more politically-engaged friends. Also the film\/book *Manufacturing Consent* (the film being slightly more accessible and up-to-date; I say slightly: it was made in the 90s, whereas the book was penned in the 80s). Head over to r\/chomsky for regularly-updated lists of must-read journalists and academics. Through that subreddit I discovered **Howard Zinn**; I'd recommend his collected essays on civil rights, law, protest, and justice in *The Zinn Reader.*\n\n**Paul Kingsnorth** doesn't identify as an anarchist per se, but his ideas have strongly influenced me:\n\n* Above all, read [The Dark Mountain Manifesto](https:\/\/dark-mountain.net\/) by Kingsnorth and Dougald Hine, or any of Dark Mountain's publications.\n* *Real England: The Battle Against the Bland*\n* *One No, Many Yeses: A Journey to the Heart of the Global Resistance Movement*\n\n**Margaret Killjoy**'s writings are wonderful, especially her book [Mythmakers and Lawbreakers: Anarchist Writers on Fiction](https:\/\/www.akpress.org\/mythmakersandlawbreakers.html). My favourite segment is her interview with **Alan Moore**.\n\nSpeaking of Moore, his magazine *Dodgem Logic* has some great essays by Killjoy on Post-Civilisation (from issue #2 onwards, I believe - you should be able to buy *Dodgem Logic* [here](http:\/\/knockabout.com\/shop\/?product=alan-moore)), and Issue #2 has an essay on anarchism by Moore himself (I also recommend his Issue #3 essay on magic and mysticism, but that's off-topic). Since the magazine is rather hard to get hold of, here is [my copy of Moore's essay](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/V7Rzwp2) in case you're interested.\n\nI'm assuming you're mostly familiar with YouTubers like **ContraPoints** et al, but if not just head over to \/r\/BreadTube for the best leftist YouTube content. Online, I'd also recommend **Existential Comics**, a philosophy-based webcomic whose creator is staunchly anti-capitalist. Through him I discovered **Simone de Beauvoir**'s *The Ethics of Ambiguity,* which is a book on existentialist thought that comes to a lot of anarchic conclusions (while we're talking about philosophy, I'd add the work of **Alan Watts**; although his ideas are often crackpot, **Terrence McKenna** is always a fun read, too).\n\nIn terms of works of fiction\/non-political writings that encouraged my anarchist tendencies, I can definitely count **Jez Butterworth's** incredible play *Jerusalem*, Moore's *V for Vendetta,* and more or less the entire oeuvre of **Roald Dahl** and **Terry Deary,** which I devoured as a child. Everyone knows Dahl, but Terry Deary wrote *Horrible Histories*, a series for kids about the real, gruesome stuff they don't teach in the classroom; the entire series is shot through with pro-working class, anti-school, anti-establishment, anti-colonial, anti-racist and anti-patriarchal sentiments. More recently, I've loved *Inherent Vice* by **Thomas Pynchon.**\n\nThrow suggestions at me!","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Anarchist writings to recommend to a friend"}

Please let me elaborate.\n\nMost liberals (and especially conservatives) like to espouse WW2 as the Pinnacle of a moral conflict between facism and democracy in the 20th century. This, for them, supports the idea that America was (and is) justified in having the world's largest military as to defend against facism globally. Ignoring the growing similarities between the US today and other facistic countries, I feel there is an argument as to wether or not the US was morally justified during WW2 in creating and using a very large military to oppose Germany. After all, at the time America was one of the world's most democratic and equal Nations and Germany was definitely one of the least.\n\nSo given that anarchism denies the value in military of all kinds:\n\n1) Did some global force need to oppose Germany during WW2 by any means necessary, seeing it as the most facist state in existence at the time?\n\n2) If the US had not armed itself, what would the world look like today? \n\n3) Given the force of facism and authoritarianism globally today, what should an ideal Anarchist nation do to assert itself in geopolitics?\n\n4) Could an anarchist nation feild a military, assuming no hierarchy had a relationship to the military and it's existence was 100% democratically imposed?\n\n5) Is Anarchism completely incompatible with the idea of an organized military?\n\nSorry if these questions are too decentralized from the question.

{"author":"RMFN","created_utc":1530977234,"num_comments":13,"score":0,"selftext":"Farmers own their own means of production. Yet are universally hated by Marxists. Why might that be? Wouldn't a farmer be the ideal Marxist? A worker who owns their own means of production? If Marxists believe that Marxism is the workers owning the means of production, why is their first step towards Marxism abolishing private property? That seems to be a glaring contradiction.\n\nIn the United States the idea of freedom and liberty orbit around the idea of an individuals private property. Freedom in the US does not mean, \"just do whatever you want.\" No, there is a complex moral framework in the context of American freedom that stems from the Lockean social contract and a hodge podge of enlightenment economic theory. \n\nFor example Lockean labor theory of value is essential to understanding the American perception of freedom. Someone who works the land in conjunction with a legal claim is said to own it. Land cannot just be owned by idle capital. It must be actively improved upon to be considered truly owned. A merchant who, like a parasite, makes all of their income off of rent is not adding to the economy and more often then not not improving the land they exploit through rents. In this way when analyzing Marxist theory ideas when it comes to abolishing private property we can say rent is what is meant to be abolished, not a situation where the worker owns their own means of production. \n\nHow does the contradiction of the petite bourgeois come into play? If they own their own store front or farm how are they exploiting the anyone? If they are both owner and worker who is being exploited? If workers own their own means of production, do they not immediately become owners? Or the enemy, bourgeois?\n\nIn conclusion my critique of Marxism and private property are meant to outline the reality of how ownership is not intrinsically tied to exploitation. Rent and other forms of usury applied to private property are. Rent is one of the most abhorrent forms of usury in the modern world. It is parasitic and takes value from hard working people. Rent adds nothing to the economy. It builds no equity. It seems to me the only people who want to abolish private property, don't own any. In my opinion, when Marx calls for the abolition of private property he does not mean the small farmers. He means the absentee landlords.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Farmers are the ideal Marxist. They own their own means of production."}

He insists that offering basic respect to minorities would have tied up too many resources in the Spanish Civil War, for instance. He acts as if feminists and queer people did not exist in 36 and are some kind of modern curiosity. \n\nHe acts as if finding reactionary attitudes like his own repugnant is antithetical to a movement that at least *claims* to stand in opposition to this kind of bullshit.\n\n[Ironically, conversations *very fucking similar* to the ones this tonedeaf manchild attempted to satirize were actually occurring at that time.](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/lucia-sanchez-saornil-the-question-of-feminism)\n\n&gt;There are many male comrades who honestly want to see women do their bit in the struggle; but this desire is not prompted by any change in their idea of women; they seek her cooperation as a factor that may hold out the prospect of victory, as a strategic contribution, so to speak, without giving a moment\u2019s thought to female autonomy or ceasing to regard themselves as the centre of the universe... \n\nMuch has changed in both feminist thought and anarchist thought since this was written, and I don't agree with everything Saornil says, but this essay's partial focus on basic respect is a conversation *we're still fucking having.* It's douchebags like rednblack that necessitate this conversation. Accepting this kind of \"only people like me deserve respect, and we just don't have the resources to treat you like a human being\" drivel doesn't just hurt minorities, it hurts anarchism as a whole, just as the Mujeres Libres pointed out almost a fucking century ago.\n\nIt's time to stop linking majority identity politics manchild bullshit.

{"author":"spachad","created_utc":1531169578,"num_comments":2,"score":6,"selftext":"I've begun reading \"Summerhill School\", which is a book about a radical education experiment that took place in England founded by A.S. Niel. In it, he explains that he never tells the kids they are bad for doing bad things. He gives this example where he planted a couple potatoes and a student picked some of them out of the ground before they had matured. Confronting the child he makes a point of NOT bringing in morality. He doesn't tell the child his\/her actions were good or evil, but rather only explains how he has been hurt by having the potatoes he worked on taken from him.\n\nFrom this and other passages in the book, it seems he attaches morality with the authority, his reasoning being that if he tells a child he is evil, the child will despise and fear him, and in the future the child will not willingly admit guilt and work out a means of upholding their relationship as equals. \n\nI find this intriguing, especially since Anarchism often analyzes the world through a moral lens and it makes me wonder if it is a mistake.\n\nOne example from my own life gives me more confidence with this assertion. There is a friend of mine who seems quite reasonable to me in terms of creativity and open-mindedness, but when it comes to his upbringing, he is a rich entitled white-cis male. We were having a debate about elon musk and if he is a guy to be looked up to. My argument boiled down to, if someone has as much money as him and you are not giving at least some of your excess wealth away, you're kind of evil. Needless to say, this argument got me nowhere.\n\nNow one could say that there's no use trying to change a person's mind who's wealth makes him part of the 1 percent, which I would definitely agree with, but I must also say that I can understand why he would detest my argument. I'm basically saying he's morally inferior. He is a part of class I am critiquing. In a sense I am trying to assert myself as a moral authority over him, which will neither change his mind nor bring us closer together as friends.\n\nI'm hoping this anecdote and Summerhill might spur some discussion about morality, particularly on its pragmatism. Let me know if you think.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Morality is Useless?"}

This is something I need at this point in my life. Radical politics would be a nice plus, but I've come to the realization that the words we use to describe our actions matter a lot less than the actions themselves. Some of the ideas for the most radical projects I've ever heard have been described to me by conservatives: communal tool libraries, communal kitchen and staples libraries, etc. \n\nI think that the strong community is a precondition more important than individuals' political beliefs. If I can find something like that, maybe I can get to know my neighbors really well and slowly start pushing the idea that we should come together now and then to make collective decisions as a community and provide safety nets for each other.\n\nHave any of you found strong communities in the rural, or somewhat small town, United States? Places where everyone knows each other, looks out for one another and shares what they have when they can? \n\nHas anyone had any success organizing projects around non-hierarchical, mutual-aid based lines in these communities? I'd like to hear stories and suggestions.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Small towns in America"}

I'm pretty sure I'm going to be reporting them to the health department pretty soon. Raw chicken mixed with ready-to-eat foods, visible days-old food on ground, no one washes knives or changes towels regularly, sneezing, coughing, and spitting on the line is a regular thing. The last couple weeks we've had a \"small\" cockroach problem, seeing and killing about 2-5 a day. The owner has refused to close down to properly deal with it. Obviously, it's gotten worse, and in the last 4 days or so, we've killed about 1500 of them. They're all over the line and near the dining room.\n\nThe owner is an abusive fuck, both verbally and physically. He has struck multiple employees. Doesn't pay hourly employees overtime, sells low quality fish and meat as different, more expensive types, and takes shortcuts wherever possible. Has employees reuse food that's hours old or serve food if it's dropped on the ground.\n\nMy only qualm about reporting him is the other employees - it's a small town, and it's one of the most popular and better-known restaurants. None of the cooks would be able to find a kitchen job that pays nearly as well as this one without moving 3 hours away. None of the servers would be able make the tips they do at any other restaurant in town. One of the guys in the back of house is here in the States \"illegally\", and I sure as hell don't want him to get caught up in anything and arrested and\/or deported back to his violent home country. Even if nothing happens to him legally, it still might be very hard for him to find a job that'll pay him cash under the table and not report him.\n\nI don't want to have to get the government involved (Health Department, Department of Labor), but even posting the pictures and videos I have online wouldn't solve any of the problems long-term. It'd be back to business as usual after a month or so, and the labor violations wouldn't be addressed at all.\n\nWhat should I do? Tell the other employees to start looking for new jobs? Just contact the health department, and not the DoL? Contact both? Contact neither, and just make the information well-known in the community? The owner is trash, and he needs to be shut down, but I don't want the other employees to face consequences of unexpected drop in wages, inability to find a new job, or deportation.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"I'm in a moral dilemma and need advice on what to do.

Progress seems to be forsaken in the status quo in place of tradition. However; this is exclusive in terms of the rapid progression of technology. I borrow many of my ideas on what society should do from here in terms of how to separate us from the oppressive regime of neoliberalism. \n\nAs a response to a recent post by \/uYuriRedFox I talked a little bit about the Venus Project. Which is a movement to fully transition away from a market-based economy to a Resource Based Economy. This does not mean a barter and trade system. Rather where using technology we automate as many jobs as we can to shift production away from scarcity, and more towards abundance. The reason to do this is mostly so that we can solve global problems such as homelessness, poverty, and the systemic inequalities of the status quo. This means that everyone would have access to anything and everything that they would need at any time. Access is one of the first steps to move a society towards this form of socio-economic evolution. Think of it this way, with advanced 3D printing technology, it has become possible to 3D print a perfect and working replica of the human cornea, and we have come close to printing working computer chips. This would mean as it becomes more and more advanced people may on a widespread platform be able to access anything that they could ever need or want on any whim. \n\nCrime would also be next to non-existent. The Venus Project is a believer that rather than criminal behavior being hereditary, it is more a result of a violent environment that shapes our natural responses to events. This can be tied to nearly every form of crime that we have today, all of those different kinds of abberant behavior are responses to the oppressive system of scarcity. Crimes of passion are a result of jealousy, anger, love, etc. Which are different problems that may happen because of a carelessness of mental health. \n\nFor more info: check this out https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VOyASsRvuws\n\nAnd this essay by Jacque Fresco called 'The Future and Beyond' https:\/\/www.thevenusproject.com\/learn-more\/the-future-and-beyond\/\n\nIf anyone has questions that are more specific, do ask!

I'll admit that I haven't finished the whole thing yet, but I heard some offhand comments that there are a lot of critiques of the book and I wanted to be able to think about those while I finished the book. \n\n  \nHere is a brief summary, although the book is fairly short: \n\n*Desert* claims that ecological disaster is at this point unstoppable and imminent; any hope of global anarchist revolution before collapse should be abandoned. We should instead think about the ways that this collapse will affect different parts of the globe, and ways that anarchists can try to mitigate it locally, and build a better community among the ruins. The author is a bit dispassionate about the billions of people who will probably die prematurely as a result of these changes, which is disconcerting. \n\nThe book was published before the Syrian Civil War, which has seen the growth of both extremely regressive movements (ISIS) and very promising ones, like the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria (formerly Rojava). This seems like a vindication of the book's predictions about collapse presents opportunities as well as challenges.   \n\n\nThere is also a discussion of Anarchism as a Western tradition vs. anarchistic tendencies today found in various subsistence farming communities in the Global South.

The founders never even foresaw an executive or even the *federal government* having this much power and influence. Regardless, there is no way to fix the mess of the administration without getting rid of the administration at all. So how do we do this, well we would all agree, a revolution, a leftist movement against not just the government but capitalism as a whole. A liberal is never going to agree with this, not right off the bat in any case.\n\nSo what then? Well my thought, call for not just the impeachment of pence and trump, but a fresh series of elections for the presidency. Elections using paper ballots (to appeal to the libs and common sense against election manipulation) and with ranked choice voting to allow for freer elections that better represent the will of the people. This is a pretty radical proposal for American politics imo. Better yet it releases a flood gate of potential movements that can grow out of the struggle to achieve this. It would open the door for an acceptance of radical politics and tactics and as people wade out of the politics of status quo they will open their minds up to new ideas such as anarchism, communism, and socialism.\n\nFrankly, I think the younger generations are becoming more progressive by the day, but there is a limit to that for the vast majority of people. If we strike now, while people are angry and frustrated, we might be able to begin really radicalizing a generation.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"A talking point I think we can use to approach liberals and a strategy to grow a much more radical America with"}

To be schooled is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, emotionally manipulated, controled, shamed, bored, corrected, patronized, and above all else, made into a slave - a good citizen and an obedient worker. To add insult to injury, the system of compulsory education does not even remotely accomplish what it claims to accomplish.\n\nState authorites determine material which the children must be forced to assimilate, and then the material is broken up into levels and further into specific topics, which the children are forced to digest one by one. In order to make this practical, they only digest bits and pieces during specified time periods so that their productivity doesn't fall too much. Since some children are older while others are younger, they are segregated from each other so they can digest age-appropirate material. Since this whole ordeal is extemely alien to the young mind, the children must be made to compete among each other in pursuit of empty rewards, and since the progress of assimilation must be monitored, the children are assigned marks depending on how good they are at doing what they're told.\n\nWhen authoritarian assumptions are dropped, the whole school system collapses. If there is no complusory curriculum, there is no reason to enact age segregation, or to force children to learn specific things at specific times. Without having children learn specific things at specific times, there is no basis on which to grade their individual work.

He was telling me about how he woke up one day and quit his excruciatingly boring factory job he held for 6 years, how he never went to college, and how he decided to seize his chance traveling around the world while he still can. He obviously is from a working class background and I thought we were going to have a lot in common.\n\nEverything changed when I asked him what he wanted to do when he got back and he said he's signed up for the police academy. I've held my tongue and ended the conversation nicely. \n\nBut I keep feeling like I can't leave without at least attempting to convince him not to become a cop. Again, I will have to bunk with this guy for at least a few more days, so I want to be nice about it and come at it from a place of empathy.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions?\n\n\n-----\n\nUPDATE: I just had a two-hour conversation with this guy. We talked about Trump and how terrible he is, how people work without really living these days, the coming climate crisis, automation, capitalism not being sustainable, how the idea of nation-states really doesn't make much sense when you think of it, Rojava, Zapatistas, direct democracy, everyday people kicking corrupt politicians and cartels out of their town, Grenfell Tower and the way the rich and the government caused that tragedy and then did nothing to help, surveillance, how protesting without masks these days is like shooting yourself in the foot- all of this and we agreed on almost everything. The only minor difference is that I was more hopeful about our ability to change this, while he thought we were pretty much doomed. \n\nThe only thing we didn't talk about was him wanting to become a cop directly...But after this conversation, I just can't see him going to the police academy, hearing all that ideology, and then going out and breaking up protests and arresting poor people without really running into an identity crisis sometime soon. I avoided talking to him directly about police, but other than that, I can't see how much more radical this conversation could have gotten.

Unsurprisingly, in this gentrified-as-fuck part of the country, our entirely donation-funded, NOTAFLOF (no one turned away for lack of funds) space is a few thousand dollars in the hole.\n\nWe aren't alone in our troubles. The steady neoliberal erosion of radical community spaces, culminating with the closure\/restructuring of the iconic In Other Words feminist bookstore, shows how serious this is. If you've ever seen Portlandia, it's the feminist bookstore in the series.\n\nWe know this because it's not easy for many of us to commute by bus from all corners of the metro area, deal with rising rents for the space and our homes, to make shows happen after we've worked for bosses all day. We know this, and you know this, we all know this: how exhausting it is to simply exist in late stage capitalism, beating the treadmill with swollen feet.\n\nMany of y'all in the past have also gone waaay above and beyond in supporting us in times of need, even though we all have our individual struggles too. Never for a second doubt our gratitude for holding us down. Every gesture, however \"big\" or \"small\"-- from coming out to events to fronting donations to having important conversations and playing incredible music, and so much more-- has made every hardship more then worth it.\n\nIn the face of a repressive authoritarian conservatism, an anarchist alternative can sometimes seem like more of a daunting task than a joyful transformation.\n\nSometimes we've asked each other how we keep going, when it seems like the collective faces one crisis after another. The truth is, Anarchism often means doing things not because they are easy, but because they are necessary. Because turning your back is not an acceptable option when gentrification is going down and the barricades are up. Because it's more rewarding and invigorating to make an effort for the whole community than resign yourself to preserving a shrinking sense of self.\n\nthe truth is, we do this for both you all &amp; ourselves. It's tiring sometimes, sure, but it's worth it. But we definitely cannot do this on our own.\n\nWorking with PPOP - Portland People's Outreach Project and local residents to help feed, clothe, and reduce harm for some of the most vulnerable people in our community has been and continues to be an incredible honor, and an instructive experience in the praxis of solidarity.\n\nRight now, the city government is threatening to shut off our water. To be clear: the city is threatening to cut off water to a needle exchange &amp; disposal site, which provides wound care, safer sex, and harm reduction materials to hundreds of people every week.\n\nBeyond this, we need your help fixing issues with the water, electrical, and heating infrastructure so st john's has a functional solidarity center. We need your help finding orgs that can help lease the space to pay the building's rent. &amp; We need to save funds to find the infoshop a location closer to most of y'all Portland comrades so we can rock the fuck out and read zines together.\n\nIf you can help us with a one time or recurring donation, hit us up on patreon: [https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/anarresinfoshop](https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/anarresinfoshop)\n\nIf you can help us by booking, arranging, or attending a show or event, hit us up and stay tuned to our event calendar.\n\nIf you can help us out by helping us fix the building, find new tenants, &amp;\/or find a new location for the infoshop, hit us up.\n\nThanks for reading.

The closest that the left came to outlining a unified solution has been anarcho-communism, which suffers from coordination problems so obvious and already covered as to not be worth discussing here. However, there is something of a practical solution that has emerged within the last ten years: the venture commune.\n\n***\n\nprecursors\n\nAs outlined by Dmytri Kliener in The Telekommunist Manifesto, the venture commune would be a consumer co-operative whose purpose was to buy up useful capital, sell off useless capital, and rent out that capital to it\u2019s members, who would use it to run their own worker co-operatives. The original, intended purpose of the scheme was to allow leftists to cooperate internationally within the system of globalized capitalist statism: by it\u2019s function as a consumer co-operative, it would allow anyone who obtained a share to join a system of workers who functioned as their own collective capitalist (collecting rents off of capital used and redistributing them to it\u2019s members, who both own nothing and quite a lot), there-by forging a classless existence within the shell of capitalist, class-stratified society. However, the concept was mired in it\u2019s Marxist roots: there was an idea that shares would be bought with labor-hours, an unwillingness to acknowledge that what it was discussing was a form of market socialism (Kleiner steadfastly insists that it\u2019s a network of exchanging producers and not a market; the difference, beyond Marxist street cred, is not apparent), and that the obvious information distribution and processing problems that the system would encounter as it gained members would be handleable by some vaguely defined network of computers.\n\nJohn Roemer, has done two things which are relevant to the topic at hand: firstly, in his 1980 A General Theory of Class and Exploitation, he produces the result that class and capitalist exploitation (his term, as opposed to feudal, status, socialist, ect. exploitation) are an emergent property of differential access to the means of production; and secondly, elsewhere [editor\u2019s note: in a serious paper, should figure out where he wrote this - can\u2019t actually cite a conversation on reddit with some random Danish grad student] he lays out a model in which -every periodic unit of time- all citizens are given vouchers (called stock-dollars, or stollars) that they can use to buy shares (with those shares only being purchasable in stollars, and there being no limit to the number of shares issuable) in any company that they want. This would largely preserve the existing capitalist system, but democratize ownership while maintaining a rational\/profit-seeking system of re-investment that would find a natural\/market-determined mix of investment\/consumption of profits through the dividends. This is, of course, stupid: what\u2019s the point of socialism if all that it means is that firms stay the same hierarchical mess that they\u2019ve always been, except there is a little extra scratch in your pocket? It amounts to an exceptionally good UBI system, and nothing more. It\u2019s the sort of thing that you\u2019d put forward if you thought that the main issue with capitalism was that it made people poor, rather than seeing that as a side effect of the hierarchies that it generates. Still, though, it does seem to satisfy Roemer\u2019s goal of eliminating differential access to the means of production - and thus, eliminating class society. However, Roemer was a Marxian through and through - and didn\u2019t understand much of the anarchist critique of things (which is thoroughly apparent from a reading of his work - he thought that syndicalism was cooperativism, for example; this is an error so bewildering I could barely believe it). My prediction for such a society is that a great deal of inequality in control over the means of production would continue - over time, a managerial group would emerge, only hiring among itself and paying itself higher and higher salaries; the market slowing the growth of this corruption by pushing any company that did so to a noticeably greater degree than others. A great deal of statistical noise, economies of scale, first-mover advantage, ect.could easily make small variations in corruption unnoticeable. Ironically, Roemer has noted this sort of corruption, terming it status exploitation - though he wasn\u2019t great at understanding it as fundamentally the sort of thing that left-libertarians of all stripes critique.\n\n***\n                                                                                                       \nthe system         \n\nThese flawed schemes from two opposing sides of socialism can be combined, however, into a system I will call \u2018market collectivism\u2019, in reference to it\u2019s similar behavior to Bakunin\u2019s proposed system of anarcho-collectivism - this similarity being, essentially, the presence of the bare necessities of life for free with work furnishing the luxuries; that this would necessarily be so will be demonstrated.\n\nIn this system, there would be a venture commune equivalent, which I will rename \u2018consumer capital co-operatives\u2019 or \u2018CCCs\u2019 to avoid confusion with the classical venture communes of Kline. In contrast to Kline\u2019s system, there would be multiple,competing CCCs. This serves the purpose of not only partitioning them into parts and avoiding diseconomies of scale, but creating a non-monopolistic market in which rents can be fairly valued, rather than the take-it-or-leave-it prices that would be given by a single CCC dominating an entire economy. That rental prices not only be low but be accurate is extremely important to maintain the socialist character of the entire enterprise. Because the compounding effect of the reinvestment of implicit rents (or, in Marxian terms, the M \u2192 C \u2192 M\u2019 \u2192 C\u2019 flow) that maintains capitalism and deepens it\u2019s divisions can only be stopped by removing the revenue derived by the producer from implicit rents from the producer\u2019s pocket - leaving the producer with only the revenue derived from their labor, no more and no less. The CCCs renting out means of production, and the worker co-operatives renting those means of production, interacting through the market, naturally calculate the  \n\nThe CCCs, rather than being run as a direct democracies with vaguely defined algorithmic assistance as Kline proposed for his venture communes, should be run as joint-stock corporations. In this new regime, the CCCs can be run more efficiently at greater total scale than venture communes ever could be, as they would take the massive informational problems of a potential direct democracy of millions of voters, and instead boil them down to the much more tractable system of a CEO elected by shareholder democracy, and responsible for appeasing shareholders by generating the maximum possible profits for them out of the rents: and, to this end, should be driven to innovate with their purchases of capital and competitively price the rents on that capital.\n\nThe polity should issue stollars periodically, generated from taxes on gross incomes of CCCs, at rates equal to the portion of value (as determined by stock price at last stollar issuing) that the CCC has out of the total value of all CCCs. This is so as to avoid the problems of a flat tax, where the unpopular CCCs fund popular ones, and to quickly force the CCCs towards long-run equilibrium and perfect competition.\n\nBy law, the CCCs should be made to have limitless shares, with share prices decided by their CEOs. Shares will only be purchasable with stollars - purchasing shares with any form of circulating currency will be illegal. If it was not illegal, one could use money earned through the intellectual labor of interacting with the stollars system to get more money - recreating the M \u2192 C \u2192 M\u2019 flow and thus capitalism. Further, shares will not be transferable, heritable, or otherwise transferable - for much the same reason. A company that is profitable and\/or expected to be profitable should logically command a higher price for (1\/n)th more of their profits. However, a CEO that over-values their stock will not only suffer increased taxation on their profits, but also will receive less than their maximal amount of stollars, as investor-citizens direct their stollars towards better deals. It should be noted that shares naturally devalue themselves over time, preventing the old (and possibly, with the march of technology, immortal or merely very long-lived) from holding all the shares in all the companies. If a company does well, people will keep spending their stollars to buy shares in it, devaluing the existing shares; that is why the requirement of infinite shares is so necessary. However, if a company does poorly, it\u2019s share-price will drop and thus lead to somewhat increased investment, it\u2019s dividends and importance will decrease and thus lead to decreased importance to overall financial equality and economic democracy, and it will eventually go bankrupt (if it does not eventually do well again) and thus make any share inequality on the basis of age a moot point.\n\nUsing stollars to \u201cpurchase\u201d shares in a CCC should not quite be seen as equivalent to using dollars to purchase shares in a capitalist corporation - while the latter is a matter of engaging in exploitation and speculation, the former is a matter of intellectual labor, in which the individual\u2019s information and brain-power is utilized in allocating the community\u2019s resources towards the best possible outcome. The key difference in this former case (aside from the general socialist character of the system) being that the resources allocated do not in any real sense belong to the individual in question given that they cannot be used for any other purpose, that each individual in the community is given an equal portion of the community\u2019s resources, and that the payment for doing this intellectual labor cannot be \u201cre-invested\u201d. Thus, the system of stollars and shares functions not only to harness the distributed information of the community, but also to provide individuals with their share of the community\u2019s dividends from the community\u2019s collective ownership -mediated by the CCCs- of it\u2019s capital.\n\nThere must be some flat \u201ctax\u201d on possession of stollars, with some small portion of an individual\u2019s un-\u201dspent\u201d stollars being periodically re-distributed to every individual in the community, so as to incentivize them to allocate the community\u2019s resources (in the form of their stollars) sooner rather than later. As a side-effect of this, there is necessarily a maximum possible price per share for any CCC, given that the number of stollars gained per unit time and the portion of the \u201ctax\u201d on stollars currently owned is the same for everyone - thus, effectively, there exists for stollars the same equation as exists for a falling object in atmosphere, and just as such an object has a terminal velocity, each individual has the same \u201cterminal stollar savings\u201d that will be reached (and not exceeded) if the individual persists indefinitely in refusing to do the useful intellectual labor of exchanging their stollars for shares.\n\nSome flat portion of the dividends of share \u201cownership\u201d must be taxed, and the currency thus obtained redistributed towards the care of those who are for whatever reason not mentally fit (in a coma, still in childhood, in advanced dementia, ect) to do the intellectual labor of choosing which shares to exchange their stollars for. This portion should be flat to ensure a minimum of distortionary effects from the taxation upon the activity of individuals. Of course, if an individual is judged to be not mentally fit, and thus in need of this care and redistribution, then they should also not be issued stollars. However, even if they were, it would not particularly matter long-term, as all stollars given to them would go unexchanged and would eventually be redistributed by the \u201ctax\u201d on unexchanged stollars.\n\nA key part of this is that it must be possible for any individual in the community to create a new CCC with themselves as the CEO (until, perhaps, they are voted out by dissatisfied shareholders; though, of course, good performance on their part should guard against such an eventuality). They would then fund their new CCC by offering shares, just as any other CCC does - the almost non-existent tax on their small enterprise, and the large tax on their pre-existing competitors, should make them competitive - especially if the poor performance or bad behavior of pre-existing CCCs really does make the actions of the would-be CEO necessary.\n\nAs a final note, some CCCs will (and should) go bankrupt. it is necessary that CCCs be dissolved in a way that leads to as little differential control over the means of production as possible. Thankfully, the most logical way to handle the dissolution of a CCC is the best: use the proceeds from auctioning off the capital of defunct CCCs to issue the old shareholders new stollars (in proportion to the shares that they held).\n\nThis allows for the upsides of both schemes, with the downsides of neither; in fact, the only two downsides I can find to this scheme are that it requires a state (a concession that hurts my inner anarchist, but that my inner DemSoc shrugs at) and that it is too strange and complex to easily and convincingly explain to most people\n***\n\ntransition from capitalism to socialism\n\nIt\u2019s hard to sketch out an idea of what transition might look like, but two paths immediately come to mind: CCC first, and state first. In CCC first, one would form a Klein-style venture CCC, and then -when it reached sufficient size-\n\nissue an arbitrary number of stollars to each memberlet anyone form a CCC and solicit stollars-for-sharesauction off capital to the CCCs issue new stollars off the proceeds of the auction (as they are buying the capital off of the members)Repeat from 2 until no more capital remains\n\nFrom there, whether maintained by contract or by direct control of the state, business can continue as normal - though, if state power has not been seized, there will be a price of buying in and that may lead to the members voting to simply become landlords off of their owned capital; operating in a capitalist system makes it hard not to be a capitalist. With the alternate, state-first system, political power is seized and a different process can be pursued:\n\nthe state goes into debt, collects taxes, or prints money to issue stollars to it\u2019s citizenslet anyone form a CCC and solicit stollars-for-sharesthe CCCs buy capital within state jurisdiction off of the open market\n\nThe most compelling way of accomplishing step 1 is through collecting taxation, and the best way to do so would be to collect taxes on the value of assets held by capitalist businesses, as that would result in the capital being cheaper for the CCCs in step 3 - as long as it was made clear that this would be a recurring thing, and that this tax would be used to issue additional stollars to citizens periodically.\n\n***\n\ntransition from socialism to communism\n\nThe value of this scheme from a post\/anti-work perspective cannot be underestimated, as it will naturally lead to people working less and less as technological development proceeds.          Assuming that individuals desire some standard of living represented by a bundle of goods and services of collective value V, and that V is the same for all individuals, and assuming that individuals wish to work as little as is necessary to attain V; then, individuals whose income from work plus their income from dividends exceeds V will leave the labor force or reduce their working hours, while individuals whose total income is under V will increase their working hours or re-enter the labor force. Because of this, the equilibrium state for an individual is with an income equal to V. However, as society over-all increases its productivity (either by an increase of labor, greater education and thus more skilled labor, through more or better means of production, or and especially through technological advancement) the incomes from shares will increase, and thus the the time spent in labor by society over-all will decrease (because of the last two; re-investment in capital, and technological advancement) while maintaining the same standard of living (V) and thus the system will asymptotically tend towards communism as more and more people have their needs met while working less and less - with a state of full automation (and thus no labor) likely eventually being reached.\n","subreddit":"DebateAnarchism","title":"My Manifesto - Cooperative-Managed Labor, Collectively-Managed Capital; or, towards a Market Anarcho-Collectivism""num_comments":0,"score":2,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"My Manifesto - Cooperative-Managed Labor, Collectively-Managed Capital; or, towards a Market Anarcho-Collectivism"}

There is little evidence of any serious attempt to verify or fact- check much \nof the claims made in the article.\n\nWe reject the insinuation that volunteers of this tabur went en masse to the war in Ukraine after the Raqqa operation. We're aware that, out of the scores of volunteers  who served with our tabur since its inception, a handful of former members have \njoined a Georgian unit in Ukraine named in honour of a WWII Nazi regiment; by doing  so, they now place themselves in opposition to the ideals that the YPG fights for (and  by extension, those they themselves fought for during their time in North Syria). We \nemphatically reject any parallel between the YPG's fight for women's emancipation,  ethnic solidarity and social revolution in North Syria, and the grubby sectarian  campaign being waged by the corrupt mafia- state in Kiev against Ukraine's ethnic \nminorities.\n\nThe YPG International Tabur was neither disbanded after the Raqqa operation, nor was it restricted to rear duties.

The risible disbandment assertion sums up the lazy  journalism that permeates this article; it's difficult to think of something easier to  prove or disprove by a simple two- minute online fact- check. It's an insult to the tabur \nmembers who were wounded in the Deir-ez-Zor and Afrin operations, and particularly  to the memory of our martyred comrade, Sehid Kendal Breizh, who was killed during the defence of Jindires.\n\nRegardless of the shoddy journalism of Rolling Stone magazine (we hope that this and  other criticisms of this unfortunate article will encourage Western journalists to up their game in future), we want to make clear that we of the YPG International Tabur \nintend to continue our involvement in the war against all the enemies of the revolution in North Syria, whether it be Daesh, the Turkish state, or any of the rest.

{"author":"CynicalAtheist5","created_utc":1532339772,"num_comments":88,"score":336,"selftext":"I'm an American-born Chinese. My parents hate Chairman Mao but romanticize the Chinese empire. The same Chinese empire that fucking committed the Dzungar genocide, enslaved millions to build the Great Wall and Grand Canal, and killed Confucian scholars. Each dynasty is treated as a separate era in the Chinese empire, but it's still the same fucking empire. The empire ruled mostly continuously for 2000 years (with a few decentralized warlord eras). Chinese people have an unfortunate tendency to romanticize the Imperial era, from what I've noticed.\n\nA lot of Americans romanticize Ancient Greece and Rome, as well as Revolutionary War-Civil War America. They don't even realize those places were feudalistic shitholes. The majority of Classical Athens' population was slaves, and women had no rights. 25% of the Roman Empire's population was in debt slavery. There were debtors' prisons in 1700s-1800s America, the only thing the American Revolution did was replace British feudalism with American feudalism.\n\nI've also seen World Cup teams and fans draw comparisons to medieval autocracies, though mainly out of ignorance rather than malice. Team Japan refers to themselves as \"Samurai Blue\", and the Samurai were from the feudal era of Japan. Mexican fans draw comparisons to the Aztecs, which were a totalitarian empire in Mexico that sacrificed humans in public ceremonies. I understand that the players and fans do not condone authoritarianism or violence, but the romanticization of medieval autocracies is misguided.\n\nA lot of people think Czarist Russia was better than Soviet-era Russia. That's bullshit because of the Russian empire's pogroms against Jews and genocides against Central Asian and Black-Sea region peoples. Imperial Russia was (you guessed it) a feudalist society.\n\nI myself used to have a weird fetish for Islamic-era Spain and the Byzantine Empire. Then I realized they were also dictatorships. Islamic Spain treated the Christian population as second-class citizens, and the Byzantine Empire was a Christian theocracy. I also visited Spain and noticed a lot of the tourist attractions romanticize Christopher Columbus, and Ferdinand and Isabella. The same monarchs who started the Spanish Inquisition and expelled the Jews from Spain.\n\nAlso, something very unsettling I've noticed. The word \"monarchy\" has a neutral connotation as a wise or fair ruler. The word \"dictator\" has a negative (but more honest connotation) as a shitty oppressive ruler. Nobody ever directly mentions that a monarch is a nepotistic dictator who owns all the land in his entire country. Yet another way in which authoritarianism is somehow justified when it's done in the pre-industrial era.\n\nWhy do people hate 20th-century dictatorships (e.g. Hitler and Stalin) but romanticize autocratic states that existed before the Industrial Revolution? In many cases, these autocratic states were similar to Nazi Germany and USSR in terms of totalitarianism or violence. (Technology has an unfortunately tendency to raise death tolls.)","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Why do people hate Hitler, Stalin, etc but fetishize pre-19th century autocracies?"}

{"author":"comix_corp","created_utc":1532613387,"num_comments":20,"score":8,"selftext":"From *Revolution and Other Writings: A Political Reader*, edited and translated by Gabriel Kuhn, released in 2010 by AK Press.\n\n________\n\n*This is Landauer\u2019s contribution to the Esperanto debate that had engulfed European socialists after the first Esperanto workers\u2019 groups had been established in Sweden (1903) and Germany (1905). Esperanto had been conceived as a means to foster international peace by the Polish school teacher L.L. Zamenhof (1859-1917), who published his outline for an easy-to-learn international language in 1887 under the pseudonym Doktoro Esperanto (Esperanto meaning \u201chopeful\u201d in the language itself). Landauer vehemently argues against the unifying virtue of Esperanto, castigating it as an \u201cartificial language\u201d that undermines what he sees as the basis for humanity united in socialism: the cultural regeneration and self-determination of the peoples.*\n\n*The essay appeared as \u201cLernt nicht Esperanto!\u201d in the November 1907 issue of Die Freie Generation [The Free Generation], a journal edited by the Austrian anarchist Pierre Ramus.*^1\n*Landauer\u2019s text is a response to ramus\u2019\npro-esperanto remarks in the article \u201cAus dem Tagebuch eines Propagandisten\u201d [from the Diary of a Propagandist], published in the Freie Generation October issue of the same year. Ramus added a response to Landauer\u2019s article, characteristically entitled \u201cLernt Esperanto!\u201d [Learn Esperanto!].*\n\n*Landauer remained opposed to the idea of creating \u201cartificial\u201d languages for easing international communication throughout his life. In a letter from april 1917, he congratulates Martin Buber for opposing a Dutch initiative demanding the establishment of an international academy to develop a common global language.*^2\n\n______\n\nIn the latest issue of Die Freie Generation, Pierre Ramus, the journal\u2019s editor, has urged his readers to learn the socalled language of Esperanto. Had he recommended reading Goethe\u2019s Faust once a year, I doubt that he would have had much success. However, I am sure that many readers are already sitting over Esperanto language guides because of Ramus\u2019 short remark. Human beings, radicals in particular, have the tendency to embrace everything \u2013 often fanatically \u2013 as long as it appears out of the ordinary. The challenge of the ordinary derives from reason and appeals to reason. However, reason is one of the two main enemies of spirit \u2013 the other is stupidity. The two often merge in spiritless intelligence. Esperanto is a perfect example.\n\nAnarchists need to understand that the basis of both individual life and\nhuman co-existence is something that cannot be invented. It is something that has to grow. Society as a voluntary union of humanity, for example, has grown. Nowadays, this union has been overgrown by a dreadful artificial product, the state. The people\u2019s languages and dialects have also grown. It is sad that different languages are often cited as excuses for hostilities between nation states. It would be even sadder, however, if humans really believed that the diversity of languages was the reason for disunity. Ineradicable, real difference does not only exist between peoples, it exists between all human beings. Each human being talks, thinks, and feels differently than others. In fact, humans can understand and talk to one another because they are different. If they were all the same, they would hate one another. Total equality is not only impossible; it would also be dreadful. \n\nThe diversity of languages is nothing to be lamented. Even less so it\nis something that we can abolish. What we need to abolish are the conditions that keep humans from learning foreign languages. Are anarchists not always opposed to palliatives and gradual improvements within the state and capitalist society? Esperanto is nothing but that \u2013 and it is a particularly ugly, useless, and dangerous palliative. \n\nOnly the most trivial, petty, and unimportant things can be expressed\nby an artificial product: only what is old and has been endlessly regurgitated \u2013 nothing new, fermenting, creative, ingenious. Language is alive. It has not only grown \u2013 it grows continuously. It contains a never-ending past, just as it contains a never-ending future. \n\nArtificial creations do not allow humans to think further and to craft\nnew things. They can only translate what has already been said many times. They can never capture what is most important in a language: the fine shades, the nuances, the unspeakable. In the grown languages, a lot of what is said lives between the words as an unutterable element. In Esperanto we can only blabber.\n\nEven for practical purposes \u2013 for example as a language for conferences \u2013 Esperanto is useless and dangerous. When the French speak Esperanto, they still think in French, and their original thoughts will only be a distant memory when expressed in this alleged \u201ccommon language.\u201d At the same time, the German or English will interpret what they hear in German and English. People might believe that they understand each other, while there will only be misunderstanding. It is much better for people not to understand each other at all than to misunderstand one another without noticing.\n\nMisunderstandings during discussions in Esperanto can only be\navoided when the discussions are reduced to banalities and platitudes. There would be neither subtlety nor refinement; nothing would be from the heart. For anarchism this would be disastrous, as there is nothing more important for anarchism than to delve into the depths of our mind and our spirit and to explore our inner being, our personality, our character, and our human nature. No artificial language can ever do this. \n\nI remember the Zurich anarchist conference of 1893^3\nand our Italian comrade Molinari.^4 His speech was fiery and wild; he gestured with his\narms and hands, and captured our attention with wide, passionate eyes. I did not understand a word of what he was saying and could only compare his incredible presentation to a roaring waterfall. Then Molinari was translated into German by the late comrade K\u00f6rner.^5\nK\u00f6rner spoke in a\nsoft, impassionate manner. This allowed me to understand everything: the thunderous appearance of the Italian as well as the calm and modest words of the translator. Had Molinari spoken in Esperanto, I would have missed an important part of this experience; an important part of life.\n\n\nThe German, French, English, and Italian understood one another incredibly well at the conference. They embraced one another with open and curious eyes. No stammering could get in the way of understanding. Shall we give up such moments of deep unity for Esperanto? Never! \n\nFor those who have the time to learn languages, I have a different\nproposal. Learn your own! Germans shall learn German; Englishmen shall learn English, and so on. Do not understand this as an expression of arrogance. Me too, I am still learning German every day; not its grammar, but the language of its great poets and thinkers. If, after you engage in this with love, you still have extra time, learn a foreign language. Not least because it will help you to understand German better; you will discover its intricacies and complexities. If you do learn a foreign language, deal with the grammar as briefly as possible! Start reading as soon as you can! Do not only translate. This is very harmful. Translating can be added later. What is important is to first learn how to read the foreign language, i.e., how to think and feel it.\n\nHere is my advice: practice thinking and feeling as it needs to be\npracticed! Practice the intricacies and complexities of grown languages \u2013 especially your own! Never give up the study of your own language! And do not learn Esperanto!\n\nPS: I recommend reading what Fritz Mauthner has written about Esperanto in his recent essay Die Sprache.^6\n\n_______\n\n1.

{"author":"SmoothJawPliers","created_utc":1532729971,"num_comments":6,"score":22,"selftext":"&gt;The overall result of these efforts is to increase the police role in the community, \rmeaning that the coercive apparatus of the state will be more  involved with daily \rlife. The state, and the police in particular, will have more opportunities for surveillance, and can exercise control in a variety of ways besides arrests, citations, or \rphysical force. This shift can be made to sound like demilitarization, liberalization, \ror democratization, but it is instead just a smarter approach to repression. The goal of community policing is to reduce resistance before force is required Hence, what may be presented in terms of democratic engagement and greater \rinclusion tends overall to favor the state's interests and reinforce state power. \n\n\r\n&gt;Negotiation and co-optation provide the means for the state to extend its influence. Thus potential sources of resistance can be neutralized or even turned \rto the state's advantage-by their incorporation into a policy community, in this \rcase one centered around and dominated by the police department.So In some \rsense, the client groups become incorporated into the state itself. It makes little \rdifference whether the client organization is a police unions a social service \ragency, a church, a school, another governmental body, or a neighborhood \rwatch group. By organizing on a sufficient scale the police can greatly enhance \rtheir own power-not only over these agencies, but through them-while \racquiring relatively few additional burdens for themselves. So long as the police \rmaintain control over the network as a whole, no one component of it is likely to \rmake demands that cannot be easily accommodated (or safely ignored). \rThis is the secret to a friendly police state: as the police more fully penetrate \rcivil society, and as they gain the cooperation of the citizenry and its various \r\norganizations, they become less reliant on their own access to violence. \rOr do they? Do they instead, perhaps, become ever less tolerant of resis-\r\ntance and disorder, ever more forceful in their own demands? \n\n&gt;Standard \rfeatures of urban life that may previously have been considered mere irritations,inconveniences, annoyances, or eccentricities, suddenly become matters for \rpolice attention. \rWorst of all, the new intolerance sometimes makes crimes out of the most human, \rhumanizing, and humane parts of city life, the aspects that make it tolerable\u2014for for some people, possible. Skateboarding, graffiti, loud parties, and other signs of \"disorder\" make cities more interesting than they otherwise would be. More importantly\rthough, the focus on public order can shut down soup kitchens and make the streets \raltogether uninhabitable for those who have nowhere else to live. \r\n\n&gt;Consider the response of two \racademic advocates of community policing, Jerome Skolnick and David Bayley, \rto Santa Ana Police Chief Raymond Davis's efforts to make the destitute unwelcome in the downtown area. Davis formed an alliance with local business owners. who pressured judges to issue stiffer sentences for public order violations.RR \rSkolnick and Bayley don't pause to worry about the separation of powers, or about private businesses interfering with the judiciary, or about the human rights \rimplications of targeting one class of people for prosecution to benefit another class-**always targeting the poor, for the benefit of the rich.**\n\n&gt;Despite all the happy talk about \"community involvement\" and \"shared problem solving,\" in practice certain populations generally get counted among the problems to be solved rather than the community to be involved. Priorities identified by \rthe \"community\" may suspiciously coincide with the interests of business owners \rand real estate developers. \r\n\n&gt;To authorize police action is to authorize violence; to direct the police to act \ragainst such minor offenses (or non-offenses) as loitering or public drunkenness \r\nis to authorize violence in circumstances where very few people would consider it justified.\n\n\n\n\nExcerpts from our enemies in blue","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"The nature of \"community policing\", beat cops and community involvement"}

{"author":"CommunismDoesntWork","created_utc":1532971102,"num_comments":7,"score":0,"selftext":"Cryptocurrencies, Smart Contracts(sometimes called dApps), and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations(DAOs) each represents three different forms of unbannable private property. What is private property? The capitalist definition of private property is straightforward; it's any piece of property that the government doesn't own. But even if we go by the left's definition, we will see that each of these 3 technologies meets their definition of private property.\n\nSo how does the far left define private property? Here are a few excerpts from a few different leftists:\n\n[\u201dWe are opposed to the kind of \\[private\\] property \u201cwhich can be used only to exploit people \u2014 land and buildings, instruments of production and distribution, raw materials and manufactured articles, money and capital.\u201d \\[Nicholas Walter, About Anarchism, p. 40\\]](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/the-anarchist-faq-editorial-collective-an-anarchist-faq-03-17#toc17)\n\n[\"If your mom made a living off fixing neighbors clothes, and accepted money for it, then \\[the sewing machine\\] would be considered private property. If she employs people and takes part of the revenue for the work done by employees, that shit's getting seized.\"](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/communism101\/comments\/6zgp2s\/personal_property_vs_private_property\/dmv9m3z\/) Here we see how communists define private property. If you use property to make money, it's private property. And if you make money using your private property while hiring others, that's doubly offensive.\n\nHere are some others on money in particular:\n\n[\"Yes, communism seeks to abolish money, but nobody knows how a moneyless post-capitalist system would run.\"](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DebateCommunism\/comments\/85o77b\/does_communism_seek_to_abolish_money\/)\n\n[\"\\[Money\\] needs to be abolished there is no way to have money and not have material individualism.\"](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/comments\/3ob4ws\/how_do_anarchists_feel_about_money_as_a_concept\/cvvx1wq\/)\n\n[\"Abolish Money!\"](https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/library\/shusui-kotoku-abolish-money) This one is particularly interesting becuase an anarchist wrote this over 100 years ago\n\nSo now let's go one by one and see if private property is bannable\n\n#Money\n\nMoney is the obvious one. Cryptocurrencies are [unbannable](https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/computing\/dont-worry-about-bitcoin-regulation-it-cant-be-stopped\/) forms of money. Their inherent decentralized structure means that not even china, who has complete control of their nations internet, could ban it. The weakest link in crypto space are the centralized exchanges. However, thanks to mining and stores that accept CCs like SilkRoad and [OpenBazaar](https:\/\/openbazaar.org\/), it's possible to acquire CCs and spend them without going through a centralized exchange. Not to mention, decentralized exchanges will be a thing one day.\n\n#Property that you use to earn money\n\nThis one is solved by boths Smart Contracts and DAOs, but I'm going to focus on Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts are awesome. If you haven't read my article on them, check out what I wrote [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GoldandBlack\/comments\/7pqkpb\/ethereums_smart_contracts_are_the_most_ancap\/). They [can compute anything that a normal program can](https:\/\/ethereum.stackexchange.com\/questions\/2464\/what-does-it-mean-that-ethereum-is-turing-complete), but are also unbannable thanks to being decentralized. For our purposes, we can think of Smart Contracts as unbannable programs. Programs are property. Even [open source programs are property](https:\/\/www.linuxtoday.com\/infrastructure\/2001051601220op). When a programer creates a program, they have the freedom to open source the code or not because they own their code(assuming they haven't agreed to give up ownership of the code in exchange for something else). If they do decide to open source their code, they also have the freedom to attach a license(any license) onto their code or not- because they own their code. It's their property. In fact, software in general can be thought of as just digital factories- it takes in inputs, and spits out some outputs. And like physical factories, someone owns them. So we've established programs and code are property. *But is it private property?* Going by the leftist definitions, yes, it can be. \n\nTake [CryptoKitties](https:\/\/www.cryptokitties.co\/) for instance. CryptoKitties is a SmartContract that lives on the Ethereum blockchain. The idea is you can trade and breed these digital cats with other users, while the company earns a fixed percentage of each trade. CryptoKitties was in fact created by an entrepreneur who hired people to help him make the product. His employees probably get paid a salary, while his company gets paid directly through the SmartContract. In fact, we can see the exact addresses that CryptoKities sends its revenue to, along with who has control over which parts of the Smart Contract: https:\/\/etherscan.io\/address\/0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d#code\nThe \"contract KittyAccessControl\" is particularly interesting. CryptoKitties was made by a team, but you could imagine if it was made by a single person. There's nothing really stopping a single person from making CKs. Either way, CKs is property that is owned by an individual or a few individuals, and is used to make a profit. And it's unbannable. The revenue from CKs will always go to the owner of the contract. That makes CKs an unbannable form of private property by their own definition. \n\n#Instruments\/Tools\/Means of production\n\nBut what about the physical computers and keyboards that the programmers use to create the unbannable programs? Couldn't those at least be seized? Nope. That's where DAOs come in. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations mother fucker. DAOs are a beast. Imagine a company with no headquarters, and no one knows who the owners or employees are, or where they're located. DAOs are built on top of Smart Contracts, but instead of a cute game like CryptoKitties, they allow an entrepreneur to codify a business structure in such a way that anyone can perform a task and get paid for it in a completely decentralized fashion. In such a business, it would be impossible to \"seize the means of production\". Even if the government tracked down one employee and stole their computer, the DAO would still automatically find a new employee to do work, potentially in a completely separate country. And even if the government tracked down the owner of the DAO, the DAO itself still might not be seizeable, assuming the owner stores their private keys in their head. Think of the Uber business model, but on steroids. Or think 'working from home' taken to the extreme. [Here's a good article on DAOs](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/future-work-jack-du-rose\/). Uber by itself actually is very interesting. Uber doesn't own any cars, the drivers own their own car. However, the Uber App isn't on the blockchain, so technically it could be banned or seized. However, if Uber were a DAO, it would become an unbannable form of private property.\n\nFar leftists would point out that DAOs also enable \"woker owned businesses\", which is true. A DAO could be programmed to fit any sort of business structure. Unfortunately for them, capitalism doesn't care at all what individuals do, as long as they don't steal or damage other people's private property, or break a contract that they agreed to. Worker co-ops like [Mondragon Corporation](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mondragon_Corporation) are as capitalist as Chicken McNuggets. Far leftists on the other hand don't extend this same level of freedom to us, which is why their ideologies are predicated on violence. In order for them to succeed, private property must be completely banned, and their very specific business model must be enforced at gunpoint. Luckily for us, we have cryptography and economics on our side. They may be able to ban certain forms of physical private property like apartments(although even that could be solved by an AirBnB Smart Contract), but they will never be able to ban all of it, or even a fraction of it. Other far leftists such as left-anarchists believe that if we get rid of the government, private property won't be enforceable, and will just automatically disappear. They believe a government is required for private property enforcement. They're completely wrong. Cryptographically-enforced private property is here to stay. They can scream and shout exploitation all they want, but their ideology is completely and utterly unenforceable, and is thus effectively dead.\n\n# In conclusion\n\n* Any ideology predicated on completely banning private property is dead\n\n* Any ideology predicated on the idea that private property will disappear if the government does as well is dead.\n\n\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"[Effort post] Will private property disappear if the state does as well?"}

I've found some things I wasn't  really aware of. I'll do my best to explain my thoughts but hoping  others will reply to better set me straight.\n\nSo with money to transact with for our daily purchases we have  basically two different types of ways to transact. Basically cash and coin which is part of a money supply considered I guess its called M0 or M1. What I was unaware of is this money supply is less then 10% of all  money in circulation. Less then 10%. So that means currently only less then 10% of transactions made in the economy can be made in private without an intermediary private bank to monitor? The rest of the money  supply used is either M1 or M2 in the form of private bank created electronic money created out of thin air in the form of debit cards or  credit cards. So my theory is that private banks want us to use their electronic forms of money so they can leverage their loans to as many people as possible and drag us into a dark future where all transactions by a citizen are monitored and analysed. A form of control over people really. Is this just a conspiracy theory?\n\nMy question to everyone then is do you believe the private banks are conspiring to have us go completely cashless so they can monitor every transaction we make and block those they deem to be illegal. I mean physical cash is probably the freest form of money we currently use then based on what I am saying and might explain why private banks are also not fans of peer-to-peer electronic cash since they want total control in being the intermediary of every transaction we make.\n\nHow do I inform people of this future the private banks are possibly trying to drag us toward. Are Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay all  pushed as cool and fun way to transact to further secure this future for private banks.\n\nI wonder how others feel about this. Do you see this future the private banks want and do you only use physical cash as much as possible because you know it is the freest way of transacting. Is this maybe the reason Bitcoin Cash and other peer-to-peer electronic currencies are so important in opposition to the private banks pushing of people to use Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay. I like these mobile payments technologies like Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay but never considered the ramifications of what it is leading us to. Am I being  paranoid. Or is complete control over our financial transactions by the private banks the dark future we are heading towards?\n\nThanks in advance to any replies.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Cash = Freedom?"}

If major changes for the better are impossible and fraught with risk that we'll fall into tyranny and horror, then we must already be living in the best possible world.\n\nBefore writing such things, I like to read up on what other people have written because maybe somebody already said it better and if not I can always get some interesting ideas.\n\nI'd be grateful for any recommendations.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Need some references about moderates"}

It seems to me that we all similar goals and beliefs and having a Leftist coalition would enable all of us to reach our goals much more quickly than if we were divided. I got the idea from reading *Homage to Catalonia* by George Orwell and seeing how Revolutionary Catalonia was torn apart by divisions between socialists, communists, and anarchists. A united and organized Left could be an effective political tool, as opposed to the splintered and extremely disorganized scene we have now (at least in the USA) which makes it almost impossible to make any kind of real change in society.
