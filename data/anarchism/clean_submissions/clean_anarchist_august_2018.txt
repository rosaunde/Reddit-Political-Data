I hope everyone is doing well.\n\nAs someone with a deep interest in both Zen and Anarchism, I have often hoped to bring the two together. I thought I would share a couple passages from a book I am reading to demonstrate the underlying current of anarchism within Zen. \n\n**Bankei Y\u014dtaku (\u76e4\u73ea\u6c38\u7422, 1622-1693)** \n\n\"In the instruction of students under his charge, the master did not lay down any rules or establish any regulations. Yet a silent, respectful atmosphere always prevailed in his temples - an example of \"Not governing, yet having no disorder; doing what is right without being told.\"\n\n\"The master continually lamented the many evil habits and customs prevalent in the Zen training halls of the day. His own teaching was direct, determined solely by the situation at hand. [...] What is more, he pledged not to quote sayings from Buddhist or Zen records in his teachings. In responding to those who came to him, whoever they were and whatever their intellectual ability, he always used plain language. [...] speaking to them in the informal, colloquial Japanese they used in their daily lives.\"\n\n\"At my temples, every moment, day and night, is the fixed and appointed time for practice. I don't do as they do elsewhere and tell you that the period of practice begins at such and such a time. Everyone doesn't start dashing around making a great fuss. \n\nThere was once a monk in my temple who had been dozing off. Another monk saw him and really laid into him with a stick. I reprimanded him: \"Why hit him when he's enjoying a pleasant nap? Do you think he leaves the Buddha-mind and goes somewhere else when he sleeps?\" Now, I don't urge people to sleep around here. But once they are asleep, you're making a serious mistake if you hit them. Nothing like that is allowed to happen here anymore. \n\nWe don't go out of our way to urge people to take naps. Yet neither do we hit them or scold them for it if they do. We don't scold them or praise them for sleeping, any more than we scold them or praise them for not sleeping. If you stay awake, you stay awake. If you sleep, you sleep. When you sleep, you sleep in the same Buddha-mind you were awake in. When you're awake, you're awake in the same Buddha-mind you were sleeping in. You sleep in the Buddha-mind while you sleep and are up and about in the Buddha-mind while you're up and about. That way, you always stay in the Buddha-mind. You're never apart from it for an instant. You're wrong if you think that people become something different when they fall asleep. If they were in the Buddha-mind only during their waking hours and changed into something else when they went to sleep, that wouldn't be the true Buddhist Dharma. It would mean that they were always in a state of transmigration. \n\nAll of you people here are working hard to become Buddhas. That's the reason you want to scold and beat the ones who fall asleep. But it isn't right. You each received one thing from your mother when you were born\u2014the unborn Buddha-mind. Nothing else. Rather than try to become a Buddha, when you just stay constantly in the unborn mind, sleeping in it when you sleep, up and about in it when you're awake, you're a living Buddha in your everyday life\u2014at all times. There's not a moment when you're not a Buddha. Since you're always a Buddha, there's no other Buddha in addition to that for you to become. Instead of trying to become a Buddha, then, a much easier and shorter way is just to be a Buddha.\"\n\n\n\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Anarchism and Zen"}

Rural folk already set a cultural premium on self sufficiency through local mutualism networks (farmer markets,seed saver exchanges). \n\nWhile many areas may lag behind on issues of social justice and equality, I think this is primarily because minority groups have been used as scapegoats by the ruling class for the problems in rural areas(caused by the policies of the ruling class). For example - immigrants, hated supposedly for taking jobs, when in reality we could blame the capitalist for buying out lands and consolidation into large industrialized monoculture farms (for 2-3crops used for export or processed foods) we don\u2019t need this much corn or soy to feed people (unless we stick high fructose corn syrup in everything). This problem could be overcome though if they were able to drop the yoke of capitalism and stop looking to the wealthy for help(rural conservatives confuse me because we white trash hate the pigs and the rich - we grew up on stories of the Pinkerton and redneck revolt...this anti statism has turned into the \u201canti-establishmentism\u201d of trump supporters.\n\nIn rural areas land is cheap,population is low, coops are common, government is small and relatively ineffective(and bonus is locally staffed- so even the cops tend to think because they shoot because they may hit a cousin or two). Low cost changes and automation could make such a big change that you\u2019d win people to your side. They are already armed and prepped for the government to try and \u201ctake my stuff\u201d (possible negative to collective talk). \n\nIf actual nazis could almost take over a small town like Leif (on Netflix welcome to Leif), then anarchists could do it for real (by basically just not being nazis)\n\nThinking about where I live - if a group of anarchists came in, bought some land, started a farmers market (that was free to those in need), patched potholes, set up a maker space and started churning out labor savers - then pretty much everyone would be on board with them being cool - and if the rhetoric was gradually introduced- they\u2019d join in before you knew it.\n\nTl;dr I think leftists should make rural folks the vanguard of the revolution instead of the butt of trump jokes and the political whipping boy the way \u201cliberals\u201d do.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Is anarchism easier to start up in a rural area?"}

I thought we were really truly going to change the world, but it didn't matter one fucking bit.\n\nLater in 2003 was the Miami FTAA meeting, absolutely the most brutal and militarized response to protest in recent memory. It's hard to convey how intense it was. The entire city was boarded up and the cops were hunting us down with bradley tanks and assault rifles. People were hiding in trees and under cars while cops were systematically clearing the streets. They call it the Miami Model.\n\nI didn't really put it together how massive these defeats were psychologically for a long time.

{"author":"daerion32","created_utc":1533513651,"num_comments":19,"score":101,"selftext":"Short summary of today's events. The Berkeley Police did everything they could to protect a small, pathetic group of assorted fascist scum as they made another attempt at an \"Anti Marxism\" rally in Berkeley. Last year, the event was cancelled after intense pressure, and this year, it seemed likely that lightning would strike twice. The Proud Boys, American Guard and Three Percenters announced they would not be participating. However, a small number of fascists still made their way in to Berkeley today, although they were outnumbered from the start. Their \"rally\" devolved into shouting matches with outraged community members and crying about the \"intolerant left\" on livestreams. At several points, the pigs body slammed and arrested community members for no reason while letting the fash push and shove whoever they pleased. Outside the park, it was a shitshow as well. We assembled an impressive crowd of about 400 anti-fascists in both bloc and plainclothes and moved to confront and shut down their rally, despite early repression from the pigs who confiscated many of our flagpoles and made it clear whose side they were on. However, at every road leading into the park the pigs blocked us. We marched around several blocks and each time a rank of piggies was there. At one point, they launched flashbangs dangerously close to our heads, a repeat of yesterday in Portland when an anti-fascist was nearly killed by a grenade. We stayed militant as fuck the whole time and pulled tables into the streets as passerbys cheered us on. However, it was clear that our chances of bypassing the police were dwindling as time went on, and the heat started to get to a lot of us. On the way, some City of Berkeley vehicles *might* have accidentally gotten some of their windows broken. Might have been the birds.\n\n  Despite heavy police repression in both Portland and the Bay Area, this weekend showed the power of community solidarity. The fash are feeling the heat, and everywhere they turn up they are confronted by a wide range of folx from militant anti-fascist to everyday citizens. If it wasn't for intense police repression, their pathetic \"rally\" would have been dispersed in minutes. Our numbers weren't quite as big as last year, but we still brought together a wide range of folx united against creeping Fascism. The fash go home today knowing that they are unwelcome and their bigotry will not be tolerated. However, the police stepped up their game as well, keeping the most militant protesters far away from the fashy playpen.\n\n  Also note that Berkeley Police are currently doxxing protesters on their official twitter, after deliberately targeting activists during the day. Today as well as yesterday in Portland showed the extent to which the police do everything they can to not only protect fascists, but humiliate and injure anti-fascists [and smile while they do it](https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/DjzbVgBU8AApHsZ.jpg). While denying fascists a platform is important, reminding the general populace of the sadism of the state is important as well. Many are convinced that the police are \"just there to maintain order,\" showing them how much the pigs enjoyed brutalizing citizens standing up to fascism would be powerful.

Marxists refer to this as exploitation, though Anarchists use that word in a different way\n   2. each individual's labor should be owned by that individual, but the means of production should be held in common. Allowing the means of production to be individually or cooperatively owned allows the individuals\/cooperatives who own better means of production to produce more (with the same amount of labor) as those who own worse means of production. Some of this increased production will be used to re-invest in better means of production, resulting in a vicious cycle of ownership inequality - and, more importantly, of different individuals being rewarded differently for identical labor - violating the principle laid out in 2\n      1. Marxists refer to this as the M \u2192 C \u2192 M\u2019 \u2192 C\u2019 circuit\n   3. Therefore, individuals\/cooperatives should be charged rent by the collective for using the collective\u2019s property - thereby extracting from the individual\/cooperative the difference between the M and M\u2019 of 2.2.1\n3. Common ownership should occur through multiple competing holding companies \n   1. this competition will allow for the setting of accurate and fair rents\n      1.

If the rent charged by the market is more than the productivity gained by using that MoP (with optimal inputs of labor), then no one will rent MoPs like that \u2192 decreasing demand \u2192 decreasing rent\n      3. therefore, rent at market equilibrium is equal to the productivity gained by using that MoP \n   2. this competition will drive innovation\n   3. this competition will fight corruption \n4. These competing holding companies should be run as follows\n   1. They are for buying, selling, and renting out the means of production \n      1. in this manner, the transition from private property to collective ownership will be smooth and continuous \n   2. Like a joint stock company, they should have shares and a CEO elected by shareholders\n      1. shares should be \u201cpurchasable\u201d only with government issued vouchers\n      2. shares should not be resellable\n      3. shares directly entitle you to a *share* of the profits made by the holding company renting out (and sometimes selling) the means of production, after they pay off their costs. Some small portion of the income an individual gets from owning shares should be taxed, and used to care for those individuals (children, intellectually disabled adults, ect) who are unable to perform the intellectual labor of investing\n   3. they should be required by law to issue a share whenever someone wants to \u201cbuy\u201d one with a voucher\n   4. The organization sets the price of their shares\n      1. they are only allowed to change this price periodically, to prevent them from attempting to devalue and revalue their shares extremely quickly to avoid taxation under 4.6-7\n      2. the maximum price of a single share should be capped (see 5.1.1)\n   5. Their gross income should be taxed at a rate equal to the \\[value of their capital \u00f7 the value of the capital of all such holding companies \\] \n      1. the value of an organization is easily calculable - it is equal to the price of a share, multiplied by the total number of shares\n   6. To prevent them from trying to sell \u201ccapital goods\u201d that are really consumer products (competing with the worker co-operatives) there should be a tax on all sales (of anything) that they make. \n      1. which provides yet another reason why \n   7. When one of these holding companies  goes bankrupt, their assets should be auctioned off\n      1. first to other holding companies , and then to the wider capitalist world\n      2. the money obtained this way should be used to issue new vouchers to all shareholders, in proportion to the shares they had invested \n5. The taxation on the holding companies  will be used to issue the vouchers to \u201cbuy\u201d shares in the holding companies \n   1. Everyone receives an equal amount of vouchers every taxation period\n      1. the cap on a price of a single share should be equal to this amount, so that no organization may have shares that are too \u201cexpensive\u201d to \u201cbuy\u201d \n   2. Vouchers are not currency\n      1. They are not transferable \n      2. They may not be redeemed for actual money by anyone other than the holding companies \n   3. There should be a regular redistribution of vouchers\n      1. this should be done by \u201ctaxing\u201d some tiny portion of an individual's stock of vouchers\u2026\n      2. ...and re-issuing the proceeds of this \u201ctax\u201d to everyone, equally\n      3. this will prevent stockpiling of vouchers\n6. With private property generally being replaced by rented property, the natural form of an enterprise becomes that of a worker-cooperative\n   1. without ownership or investment, there is no justification for wage-slavery\n   2. without the cooperative owning any of the means of production it uses\n      1. ...there is no idea of having to buy in to a cooperative to work there\n      2. ....nor of having to buy someone out to fire them\n      3. \u2026nor of the idea of working in a cooperative being riskier than being a wage-slave\n   3. to prevent individuals or worker cooperatives attempting to hold large amounts of private (as opposed to personal) property, a tax should be placed on it\n      1. this tax should be some small portion of the value of the property\n      2. this tax should be self-assessed - meaning that the value of the property is decided by the one who owns it\n      3. ...the caveat being that if any of the holding companies wishes to buy the property for that price (and can actually put up the money to do so) then the owner must either sell that property (for that price, to that holding company) or raise their self-assessment \n      4. as a consequence, the price of anything that a holding company is unlikely to want (i.e., any personal property) can safely be assessed at a value of 0, and thus be tax free. Any excessive property, that straddles the line between personal and private (a car, a house, ect) can still be possessed as long as one pays the tax on it","subreddit":"socialism","title":"A Modern Socialist Manifesto""num_comments":7,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"A Modern Socialist Manifesto"}

{"author":"Anarcho_Humanist","created_utc":1533664033,"num_comments":1,"score":59,"selftext":"From Anarchy Works by Peter Gelderloos\n\nA particularly remarkable network of autonomous villages can be found in the mountains around Itoiz, in Navarra, part of the Basque country. The oldest of these, Lakabe, has been occupied for twenty-eight years as of this writing, and is home to about thirty people. A project of love, Lakabe challenges and changes the traditional aesthetic of rural poverty. The floors and walkways are beautiful mosaics of stone and tile, and the newest house to be built there could pass for the luxury retreat of a millionaire \u2014 except that it was built by the people who live there, and designed in harmony with the environment, to catch the sun and keep out the cold. Lakabe houses a communal bakery and a communal dining room, which on a normal day hosts delicious feasts that the whole village eats together.\n\nAnother of the villages around Itoiz, Aritzkuren, exemplifies a certain aesthetic that represents another idea of history. Thirteen years ago, a handful of people occupied the village, which had been abandoned for over fifty years before that. Since then, they have constructed all their dwellings within the ruins of the old hamlet. Half of Aritzkuren is still ruins, slowly decomposing into forest on a mountainside an hour\u2019s drive from the nearest paved road. The ruins are a reminder of the origin and foundation of the living parts of the village, and they serve as storage spaces for building materials that will be used to renovate the rest of it. The new sense of history that lives amidst these piled stones is neither linear nor amnesiac, but organic \u2014 in that the past is the shell of the present and compost of the future. It is also post-capitalist, suggesting a return to the land and the creation of a new society in the ruins of the old.\n\nUli, another of the abandoned and reoccupied villages, disbanded after more than a decade of autonomous existence; but the success rate of all the villages together is encouraging, with five out of six still going strong. The \u201cfailure\u201d of Uli demonstrates another advantage of anarchist organizing: a collective can dissolve itself rather than remaining stuck in a mistake forever or suppressing individual needs to perpetuate an artificial collectivity. These villages in their prior incarnations, a century earlier, were only dissolved by the economic catastrophe of industrializing capitalism. Otherwise, their members were held fast by a conservative kinship system rigidly enforced by the church.\n\nAt Aritzkuren as at other autonomous villages throughout the world, life is both laborious and relaxed. The residents must build all their infrastructure themselves and create most of the things they need with their own hands, so there is plenty of work to do. People get up in the morning and work on their own projects, or else everyone comes together for a collective effort decided on at a previous meeting. Following a huge lunch which one person cooks for everyone on a rotating basis, people have the whole afternoon to relax, read, go into town, work in the garden, or fix up a building. Some days, nobody works at all; if one person decides to skip a day, there are no recriminations, because there are meetings at which to make sure responsibilities are evenly distributed. In this context, characterized by a close connection to nature, inviolable individual freedom mixed with a collective social life, and the blurring of work and pleasure, the people of Aritzkuren have created not only a new lifestyle, but an ethos compatible with living in an anarchist society.\n\nThe school they are building at Aritzkuren is a powerful symbol of this. A number of children live at Aritzkuren and the other villages. Their environment already provides a wealth of learning opportunities, but there is much desire for a formal educational setting and a chance to employ alternative teaching methods in a project that can be accessible to children from the entire region.\n\nAs the school indicates, the autonomous villages violate the stereotype of the hippy commune as an escapist attempt to create a utopia in microcosm rather than change the existing world. Despite their physical isolation, these villages are very much involved in the outside world and in social movements struggling to change it. The residents share their experiences in creating sustainable collectives with other anarchist and autonomous collectives throughout the country. Many people divide each year between the village and the city, balancing a more utopian existence with participation in ongoing struggles. The villages also serve as a refuge for activists taking a break from stressful city life. Many of the villages carry on projects that keep them involved in social struggles; for example, one autonomous village in Italy provides a peaceful setting for a group that translates radical texts. Likewise, the villages around Itoiz have been a major part of the twenty-year-running resistance to the hydroelectric dam there.\n\nFor about ten years, starting with the occupation of Rala, near Aritzkuren, the autonomous villages around Itoiz have created a network, sharing tools, materials, expertise, food, seeds, and other resources. They meet periodically to discuss mutual aid and common projects; residents of one village will drop by another to eat lunch, talk, and, perhaps, deliver a dozen extra raspberry plants. They also participate in annual gatherings that bring together autonomous communities from all over Spain to discuss the process of building sustainable collectives. At these, each group presents a problem it has been unable to resolve, such as sharing responsibilities or putting consensus decisions into practice. Then they each offer to mediate while another collective discusses their problem \u2014 preferably a problem the mediating group has experience resolving.\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"A Glimpse into life in an anarchist community: Itoiz Villages"}

I was a bit uncomfortable. It\u2019s not that other guests weren\u2019t pleasant and amicable, and Father Graeme, who had organized the party, was nothing if not a gracious and charming host. But I felt more than a little out of place. At one point, Father Graeme intervened, saying that there was someone by a nearby fountain whom I would certainly want to meet. She turned out to be a trim, well-appointed young woman who, he explained, was an attorney\u2014\u201cbut more of the activist kind. She works for a foundation that provides legal support for anti-poverty groups in London. You\u2019ll probably have a lot to talk about.\"\n\n&gt; We chatted. She told me about her job. I told her I had been involved for many years with the global justice movement\u2014\u201canti-globalization movement,\u201d as it was usually called in the media. She was curious: she\u2019d of course read a lot about Seattle, Genoa, the tear gas and street battles, but \u2026 well, had we really accomplished anything by all of that?\n\n&gt; \u201cActually,\u201d I said, \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of amazing how much we did manage to accomplish in those first couple of years.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cFor example?\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cWell, for example, we managed to almost completely destroy the IMF.\u201d\n\n&gt; As it happened, she didn\u2019t actually know what the IMF was, so I offered that the International Monetary Fund basically acted as the world\u2019s debt enforcers\u2014\u201cYou might say, the high-finance equivalent of the guys who come to break your legs.\u201d I launched into historical background, explaining how, during the \u201970s oil crisis, OPEC countries ended up pouring so much of their newfound riches into Western banks that the banks couldn\u2019t figure out where to invest the money; how Citibank and Chase therefore began sending agents around the world trying to convince Third World dictators and politicians to take out loans (at the time, this was called \u201cgo-go banking\u201d); how they started out at extremely low rates of interest that almost immediately skyrocketed to 20 percent or so due to tight U.S. money policies in the early \u201980s; how, during the \u201980s and \u201990s, this led to the Third World debt crisis; how the IMF then stepped in to insist that, in order to obtain refinancing, poor countries would be obliged to abandon price supports on basic foodstuffs, or even policies of keeping strategic food reserves, and abandon free health care and free education; how all of this had led to the collapse of all the most basic supports for some of the poorest and most vulnerable people on earth. I spoke of poverty, of the looting of public resources, the collapse of societies, endemic violence, malnutrition, hopelessness, and broken lives.\n\n&gt; \u201cBut what was your position?\u201d the lawyer asked.\n\n&gt; \u201cAbout the IMF? We wanted to abolish it.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cNo, I mean, about the Third World debt.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cOh, we wanted to abolish that too. The immediate demand was to stop the IMF from imposing structural adjustment policies, which were doing all the direct damage, but we managed to accomplish that surprisingly quickly. The more long-term aim was debt amnesty. Something along the lines of the biblical Jubilee. As far as we were concerned,\u201d I told her, \u201cthirty years of money flowing from the poorest countries to the richest was quite enough.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cBut,\u201d she objected, as if this were self-evident, \u201cthey\u2019d borrowed the money! Surely one has to pay one\u2019s debts.\u201d\n\nOK, let me stop at this point. If you keep reading, Graeber dives into a larger discussion about what it means to \"pay one's debts\" and the circumstances under which debt was generated and about the contrast between the personal norm of repaying debt (which is intuitive) and the non-consensual aspects of debt between those with power (creditors) and those without (debtors) which betray the otherwise intuitive norm of paying back one's debts. \n\nI was listening to this book via audiobook, and here is where I started to think things felt \"sexist\":\n\n&gt; At one point, Father Graeme intervened, saying that there was someone by a nearby fountain whom I would certainly want to meet. She turned out to be a trim, well-appointed young woman who, he explained, was an attorney\u2014\u201cbut more of the activist kind. She works for a foundation that provides legal support for anti-poverty groups in London. You\u2019ll probably have a lot to talk about.\"\n\nIn an audiobook, one does not have the benefit of images. As a result, you have to paint a picture for the audience. Graeber's style is to be direct, authentic, and autoethnographical. I genuinely think he is providing an accurate description of the woman as he saw her, as \"trim,\" for example. \n\nBut this description felt sexist to me. Here we have a woman who is introduced primarily by her \"trim\" body rather than her work as an attorney (or any other characteristic). \n\nWith this in mind, he continues to have a conversation with this women in which:\n\n&gt; As it happened, she didn\u2019t actually know what the IMF was, so I offered that the International Monetary Fund basically acted as the world\u2019s debt enforcers\u2014\u201cYou might say, the high-finance equivalent of the guys who come to break your legs.\u201d I launched into historical background, explaining ...\n\nThe woman is now playing practically a trope: the attractive but uneducated or slow-witted woman, who doesn't know what the IMF is and needs lots of explanations for everything (which Graeber is happy to provide). \n\nLook, it's extremely useful to have a character that is like the audience: a character that asks the questions the audience might, and prompts the answers Graeber ultimately wants to introduce to us and discuss. But why does it have to take the shape of a \"trim, well-appointed young woman\"? \n\nAm I being too sensitive? Does anyone else feel like there is a bit of subtle, informal sexism going on here? \n\nI don't think this makes Graeber some evil patriarch, rather I think he might just have blinders from being a man in a patriarchy. \n\nAnyway, I wondered what everyone else thought about this.\n\nThanks for reading. :-)\n\n\n\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"David Graeber's informal sexism in \"Debt: The First 5,000 Years\""}

I've been trying to get a job recently (in high school right now) and went to a job fair at skyzone. I filled out a form around maybe 8 people my age, and one man maybe 25 years old, with a beard who was scrawny and dressed in cheap clothes (not judging, I stand by my bootleg specials t shirt). After about 15 minutes, we were all called into a room, and had a group interview. There were standard questions like 'why do you want to work here' to which the 25 year old guy responded 'for my daughter'. The interviewer went on completely normally as if that weren't really sweet or anything, and went on to ask some utter bullshit. Now, I could tell these guys were the kind of 'work hard play hard' people who were extremely disingenuous about the fact that that just means 'work hard, maybe let me make a few painfully unfunny jokes.'. this fucking lady asks, 'what is your spirit animal, and could you act it out?' everyone kind of nervously laughed at it, one guy said a wolf, and was required to make a fucking wolf sound in front of 9 strangers and who could possibly be his future boss. Then the 25 year old guy goes. He stands up, makes eagle noises and flaps his arms around, and sits down again. The stupid fucking 'dance monkey dance' scenario I was seeing made me furious.

They believe it is morally more just to own property than not to. To have private property, private business, private corporations, private enterprise of all sorts. I think they believe it is more moral, however:\n\nI think they accept a fundamental differing quality that makes the outcome from 'market anarchism' and socio or colectivo or primitivo or syndicalist Anarchism very different. I am not certain the outcome \\*HAS\\* to be different, but I am telling you that if the model in my head is right, it ALWAYS works out one way and one way only.\n\nThe reason Proudhon argued, \"Property is robbery\" was precisely because if you allow (without limitations of any kind) wealth to purchase things, and you have an inequality of wealth, wealthy purchasers will possess more property. I get this doesn't sound particularly shocking at first, but please, I beg of you, bear with me for one more bridge. If you take this in practice; it means that a wealthy owner like Rockefeller can buy literally every square inch of arable land that is for sale, and own this land in all perpetuity. He can choose who has access, he can say that ten million peasant farmers born that way (due to the inequality of wealth) do not deserve to even be able to work for food. He can literally starve an entire nation, if he wants. If we take property as an absolute.\n\nI realize this argument is not \\*real\\* in a pure sense, but it is an important principled argument to demonstrate the single primary grievance with this system. In our government (modern republics and such)? That cannot happen. You can buy land, sure, but the government will not let you own a monopoly on all land. You can have a private enterprise, but the government will not let you be a monopoly that owns all opportunity in that field of enterprise. There have to be limits to the extremes of wealth in a wealth-based system.\n\nSocialism, whether or not it works in real life (I ardently believe I can easily prove it does), rejects wealth. It rejects property. Not your teddy bear, you keep that. Personal property isn't an issue. Your house is yours, the land you till is yours, in Anarchism. But this idea of institutionalized right to own everything if its for sale, in the hands of an ever-decreasing few, that is the core problem. In Socialism they simply eschew the concept of money. In socio-Anarchism, or Anarcho-communism. The way those societies work in principle is by simply removing money entirely. Most trade, too. You trade your labor for your local community in whatever way they need you to and you deem fit, and you get back the commodities they love to produce in return. That's the basic idea in practice.\n\nYou need shoes? This guy likes to make shoes. Go get some shoes from him. Do you trade anything? Not a thing. He makes shoes cause he really likes making shoes, and he likes serving his local community. What do you do to serve it? That depends. How do we make sure you don't sit around doing nothing in perpetuity to not serve your community? We shame you. Hey Bob, Bob, what'd you do today? Hey Bob, I see you got that nice fat steak. Hey Bob! I haven't seen you at the town hall meeting, Bob, hey Bob! I see you got that new car, hey Bob! What do you do again? Sit at home all day? Do you write? Can I see it? Hey Bob! Would you care to lend me hand in my field?\n\nSocialism, at least left-leaning socialism (same as anarcho-cap, I reject right-wing socialism) assumes as a fact that most if not all humans feel shame, pride, and WANT to participate in theiir communities, if not coerced, if not made lesser, if not obstructed in other abstract and institutional ways. This principled moral idea is the SAME actually between right and left wing liberterians, they BOTH assume this. I just think wealth is the trick. Wealth without limits of any kind is inherently, logically, purely a bad idea. It ends in tragedy. I don't mean your wealth, I don't mean your personal triumphs in life that let you live well, I get that, I really do. I mean some generationally rich kid who just happened to be born into owning EVERYTHING. That is immoral on its face.\n\nI think we are the same, we just differ on 'property'. A key difference. And I think they get triggered a lot, too, honestly, by thinking we insist to 'steal' what they have. We do not. We insist that we all have the same right to work and get and be. Both of our traditions. So instead of listening to each other we end up bringing out the clubs of rhetoric we wield to beat each other over the head ad infintum.\n\nI have known many GREAT libertarians on BOTH sides. I love you all. Seriously.\n\nP. S. This exact quote plays in my head when I get into a proper logical discussion: I think THIS is the point of argument. It is the only reason I own an account on Twitter (hours later, I just realized I care so little about Reddit that I called it Twitter), it is the reason I came to this forum, it is the reason I engage in debate. The truth.

{"author":"CaniTerrae","created_utc":1533922596,"num_comments":18,"score":7,"selftext":"A plan is the basis of any good action: and I earnestly believe that the only conceivable plan that will ever advance Anarchism (and morality) is the creation, spreading, and consumption of media with our message.\n\nI think it all comes down to propaganda (a foul word to many). We must persuade people of our cause. This isn't inherently dirty, and the difference lies in that we will not be disingenuously tricking them. Our rhetoric is to save them, to save all humanity from its fetters.\n\nHow did FAI Spain inoculate its community against the rhetoric of the tycoons of industry (fascism, imo), and spread the love of self-determination and freedom? How did FAI Spain ever come to exist? Newspapers, media. Lots of media that was spread.\n\nIf we want to fight them, I think the absolute first tactic is to TEACH them. You can argue that you won't reach many, but I think that is a cynical and self-defeatist attitude and that it should be abandoned before you begin, or you have already doomed all reason and hope to failure (in your mind). Those who can be inoculated will be inoculated this way, those who can be treated will be treated this way, those who are resistant to treatment should have every possible manner of alternative methodology attempted (that you can). Then we arrive at the next step:\n\nIf you cannot teach them, you shame them. It's a non-violent and extremely effective social motivator across a spectra of domains. You remember when you were a teenager? What did you fear most in the world? For many people, it was humiliation. Humiliation DESTROYS people in (what can be) a very productive manner, in my opinion. Mind you, this methodology requires that a significant amount of any social group be ready to engage in it for it to be \\*extremely\\* effective. How do we stop people from masturbating in public? Some say the law, I say the vast amount of that is obviously shame related. I know, an extreme example. Shame, to my knowledge, is how all primitive humans managed to maintain Anarchism in their societies. Those with big heads get knocked down a peg. Those who don't work? Well, can they? Yeah, let them know that. Together now!\n\nThe next step would be exile. Complete removal from social contact. Humans DIE in isolation. Literally. There are almost no humans that CAN live in a cave. It is forceful (yet potentially non-violent and in no way absolutely 'violent' method) method, but it solves the problem. Permanently. (or for however long society needs it to work) This is harder to do in our society, but is done more in Britain (I hear). A fascist there will have (basically) no friends in his community. If he goes around saying 'f'n 'race' this' and 'f'n 'race' that' then he has no friends. They do not associate with him, they do not allow him to be in their space, they do not go around him, they do not acknowledge him when he says hello, they do not acknowledge his existence. I know a lot of people like to act tough, but if it is a significant majority, this destroys most psyches. They will be \\*FORCED\\* to reassess their action (or go form a terror cell with their little buddies, in which case self-defense and the next step come in:)\n\nThe final step, in my little system of logic here, is defense. If these prior three have not worked, you are only left with this one. If he cannot be reasoned with, he cannot be shamed, he cannot be told to go away...well. If he's still a problem...yeah. Justifications vary here. My line is when people attack. I realize it's not a solid line, but I have a solid argument for it. Basically it goes like this:\n\nViolence is the absolute and purest form of actual oppression. Entering into any form of violence has a MASSIVE burden of proof to justify it. The easiest and least controversial justification has always been self-defense. Why is this practically relevant as well as morally? Because:\n\nIf we do not have the numbers to use the above four steps morally, we do not have the numbers to win. Period. If you want to 'fight the power' in a militant sense, you \\*MUST\\* consider it militarily. You see how FARC won that guerrilla war? Yeah, they didn't. Violence cements the common people against us (logically, morally, and practically; if we are the initiators). It is the very foundation of the condemnation of Anarchism in almost all rhetoric I have heard.\n\nYou want to win with guns? Why? That's the first question. If you can answer that satisfactorily then (and only then) can we move to: How? At least a sizable minority (!I DO NOT ADVOCATE THIS IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM! DO NOT!) destroying the centralized power. What is the problem with this idea, you may ask?\n\nOpportunistic vanguardism. You have a militant, organized (bureaucratic), blooded minority of any movement win over the previous authority and they will (in my opinion) WITHOUT FAIL become the new authority, and be militant, and bloodied. I have seen no exception to this. Ever. Once in power, the elites of the new vanguard do not give it up. At least one of them (perhaps crazed from war) will seize power. Generally the one with the loyalty (and rhetoric to control) the most troops leftover from the revolution. This is how Lenin destroyed Socialism (and democracy, and freedom, and for many...hope) in the infant Soviet Union. As far as I can see historically, this is a universally applicable principle. The Van may be your best mates, but when they're done being devils of war, killing people in their sleep (it would require MUCH murder, slaughter, TOTAL WAR to achieve a minority faction victory over both fascists and our government, or either) who will they be? At least one will be a devil, I'd wager; no matter how pure you think the conviction of your cause is. War is not a place for purity. War is not a place for sanity. War is not a place for anything but the absolute worst and most atrocious and despicable aspects of humanity.\n\nDid I go on a tangent? Sorry.\n\nFascists: Beating them? Don't. Assimilate them. Sunzi was right. Read Sunzi. That's all you need to know about warfare. Honest. Just destroy their plans, isolate them, don't feed them traction, spread our traction, win. Win by attacking plans and NOT waging war. If we must wage a war and win? You still have to spread traction or nothing like our movement will end up winning. Some perverse half-realized stunted version of it \\*MIGHT\\*.\n\nUltimately, ours is all about persuasion. Media, traction, logic, compassion. It's really...in no uncertain way...partially our fault (together as a society) that these kids are this way. I'm not saying individually...buuuut...our society failed them. I mean that \\*ENTIRELY\\*. Every one of those fascists is a victim not only of his tormenting of you but of his delusions tormenting himself.\n\nI went to high school in Southern Alabama. You would not believe me if I conveyed the truth of that place to you, most likely. It is abysmal. That high school DESTROYED MY MIND...not that it wasn't already cracked. I had to build myself a new one. Not the first time. It is a torture facility, as far as I'm concerned, posing as a daycare masquerading as a high school. It's a fucking prison. It's a nightmare. I have spent my life studying words and I have no words right now. You...it...we...that CANNOT remain.\n\nWe failed them in this way, and in others. Not you, not I, but not not you, and not not I. Not not our parents. Society is a crazy complex abstract concept. But that shit? It perpetuates this problem. They are trapped in delusions of tortured minds. I pity them.\n\nI do get it though, I REALLY do. I really do...\n\nNo one touches my daughter. No one. I get it.\n\nSummation: I am literally attesting that the media of freedom (and learning freedom, and doing freedom) will set us free. I am including fascists in the word 'us', yes. Anarchism is a movement for humanity. It is a movement without divisions or classes or races. It is a quasi-religious movement that states (to me in its most simple form, on a purely abstract level) \"I will not submit to you. You will not submit to me. I will not make you submit to me. You will not make me submit to you.\" Once this is established, what threat can possible exist between two people?\n\nSubmit here means...be made lesser. I submit in the bedroom, I dun give a fuck. I mean actual...oppression.\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z0TLxsVrWEA](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z0TLxsVrWEA)","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Four Methods of Fighting Fascists: Chomskian-Pacifist Anarchism"}

{"author":"thepriceofaslave","created_utc":1533990858,"num_comments":5,"score":7,"selftext":"*\u201cInstead of securing general conditions of well-being by means of mutual understanding, the antisocial spirit has reached such a pitch that the wealthy would rather throw their money into the sea than relieve the lot of the indigent, while the very poorest of the poor would get less from appropriating to their own use the property of the rich than from depriving them of it.\u201d* \u2013 Plato\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDespotism may for a time retard the concentration; democracy, allowing the most liberty, accelerates it. The relative equality of Americans before 1776 has been overwhelmed by a thousand forms of physical, mental and economic differentiations so that the gap between the wealthiest and the poorest is now greater than at any time since imperial plutocratic Rome. In progressive societies the concentration may reach a point where the strength of numbers in the many poor rivals the strength of ability in the few rich; then the unstable equilibrium generates a critical situation, which history has diversely met by legislation redistributing wealth or by revolution distributing poverty.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nAccording to Plutarch, in the Athens of 594 B.C., \u201cthe disparity of fortune between the rich and the poor had reached its height, so that the city seemed to be in a dangerous condition, and no other means of freeing it from disturbances seemed possible but despotic power.\u201d\nThe poor, finding their status worsened with each year\u2014 the government in the hands of their masters, and the corrupt courts deciding every issue against them\u2014 began to talk of violent revolt. The rich, angry at the challenge to their property, prepared to defend themselves by force. Good sense prevailed; moderate elements secured the election of Solon, a businessman of aristocratic lineage, to the supreme archonship. He devaluated the currency, thereby easing the burden of all debtors (though he himself was a creditor); he reduced all personal debts, and ended imprisonment for debt; he canceled arrears for taxes and mortgage interest; he established a graduated income tax that made the rich pay at a rate twelve times that required of the poor; he reorganized the courts on a more popular basis; and he arranged that the sons of those who had died in war for Athens should be brought up and educated at the government\u2019s expense. The rich protested that his measures were outright confiscation; the radicals complained that he had not re-divided the land; but within a generation almost all agreed that his reforms had saved Athens from revolution.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe Roman Senate, so famous for its wisdom, adopted an uncompromising course when the concentration of wealth approached an explosive point in Italy; the result was a hundred years of class and civil war. Tiberius Gracchus, an aristocrat elected as tribune of the people, proposed to redistribute land by limiting ownership to 333 acres per person, and allotting surplus land to the restive proletariat of the capital. The Senate rejected his proposals as confiscatory. He appealed to the people, telling them, \u201cYou fight and die to give wealth and luxury to others; you are called the masters of the world, but there is not a foot of ground that you can call your own.\u201d Contrary to Roman law he campaigned for reelection as tribune and in an election day riot he was slain (133 B.C.). His brother Gaius, taking up his cause, failed to prevent a renewal of violence and ordered his servant to kill him, the slave obeyed and then killed himself (121 B.C.). 3000 of Gaius\u2019s followers were put to death by senatorial decree. Marius became the leader of the plebs but withdrew when the movement verged on revolution. Catalan proposed to abolish all debts, organized a revolutionary army of \u201cwreched paupers\u201d. He was inundated by Cicero\u2019s angry eloquence and died in a battle against the state (62 B.C.).   \nJulius Caesar attempted a compromise, but was cut down by the patricians (44 B.C.) after five years of civil war. Mark Antony confused his support of Caesar\u2019s policies with personal ambitions and romance; Octavius defeated him at Actium, and established the \u201cPrincipate\u201d that for 210 years (30 B.C. \u2013 A.D. 180) maintained the Pax Romana between the classes as well as among the states within the Imperial frontiers.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nby Will Durant The Lessons of History","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Wealth inequality ancient Greece vs Rome (Forced redistribution vs 100 years of civil war) Historical example"}

There is a term in the mental health industry called the Goldwater rule, which states it\u2019s unethical for psychiatrists to give professional opinion about public figures not examined in person. They must consider the moral implications. Outcome of the Yale conference was that it would be morally unethical to not address the mental health of Donald Trump &amp; release the findings publicly. From 1700 professionals the top 27 wrote this book called \u201cThe dangerous case of Donald Trump\u201d. This is far worse than I thought. What the world is dealing with is called \u201cmalignant normality\u201d, due to his narcissism coupled with mental decline, fragile self-esteem &amp; trust in himself causing him to take drastic actions to prove himself to himself &amp; the world, as well as a bunch of other factors. The book talks of psychological conditions which causes him to behave the way he does (I say often he will get far far worse)\n\nIf someone in office is mentally ill &amp; diagnosed as such, nothing should be said about it, however if that mental illness causes them to be dangerous then it must be made public. That\u2019s the definition in the 1st few chapters &amp; reason for the name of the book.\n\nSo, Trump has NPD (narcissistic personality disorder) with hyper mania. In 1988 he had mania episodes which lasted weeks at a time, he cheated on his wife, bought stocks for companies he wanted to own without following through, bought real estate at asking prices, spent wildly causing his 1st corporate bankruptcy, they took many assets to pay debts including his super yacht. That year politico wrote an article \u201cThe year trump lost his mind\u201d Many problems stem from childhood with his parents, he never developed trust (essential to development) being root cause of disorders. His elder brother Fred Jr, had similar issues &amp; being an alcoholic drank himself dead at 42.\n\nDelusional disorder causes people to be thin skinned (this weekend his twitter rage attacks were 48 in two days, up from 32 last weekend) His sociopathology is text book, exhibiting persistent antisocial behaviour coupled with impaired empathy &amp; remorse. He is a pathological liar. (All tied to his inability to trust) it is conceivable that he may pass a lie detector tests on things said which are the opposite of the truth. He is drawn to leaders who fit his fundamental personality make up, Sadam, Assad, Kim Jung Un, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi,Rodrigo Duterte,Putin. He is not crazy like a fox but rather crazy like a crazy.\n\nSurrounding himself with family members is not just nepotism, but due to his cognitive decline -dementia (which his father suffered from), he keeps family members close as they are sympathetic to him. His personality style impedes reliable judgement &amp; sound response when faced with crisis. His narcissistic traits are evident in his blatant lying, impulsiveness &amp; compulsiveness -against logical reason. This makes it impossible for him to view himself (honestly) through the lens of his mental dysfunction. His narcissism is heard in his description of himself \u201cThe greatest\u201d, \u201cTremendous\u201d, \u201cknowing more than anyone else\u201d. Most telling is his expectation of being viewed as superior without accompanying achievements. The need to destroy everything Obama achieved is not just paranoia but more so to what he is unable to achieve himself. He (paranoid) always finds betrayal in those surrounding him, reacting in retaliatory anger &amp; challenges us with -Are you going to believe me or your lying eyes?\n\nJust so u know the book was released Oct last year. (Where the psychiatrist mentions) trump \\*implies\\* \u201care u going to believe me or your lying eyes\u201d He actually said the words \u201cdon\u2019t believe what u see &amp; what u hear\u201d last week at a rally broadcast on Tv.\n\nHis base is comforted to believe they have a forceful advocate who possesses the authority &amp; motivation to fix what worries them. (Although has no interest in pursuing the interests of the truly powerless) being a person who blames others for everything including own errors &amp; mistakes, again is rooted in childhood, it is a fear driven response as a coping mechanism. He always needs to be right more than doing the right thing &amp; very often lashed out in order to feel better about himself. He says America 1st but no real understanding of the selfless giving in true patriotism. In relationships we need mutuality &amp; trust (which he cannot) &amp; is why relationships with narcissists end badly. His 1st wife accused him of rape, that fits within his profile. After a hefty divorce settlement, she has never fully discounted her accusations.\n\nPsychologists have coined Post election stress disorder &amp; Trump anxiety disorder. Although similar to General Anxiety Disorder (GAD) it is defined with specific symptoms -some physical. Doctors now offer assessment related to politics to see if current patient conditions have worsened due to the current political climate. Existing patients who have\/had a narcissistic father or other family member (or boss) for example are worse now with Trump as president. Those suffering from Trump Anxiety Disorder are more depressed, negative, check the news too often to know more &amp; by doing so have a further false sense of control but paradoxically end up exacerbating their anxiety. They tend to drink &amp; smoke too much, stress eat &amp; so on. If he we\u2019re not president, his ravings would be those of an arrogant, unmindful, loudmouth reality Tv celebrity who seeks attention by cultivating shock &amp; outrage on both ends of the political spectrum. I quote this from 1 of the 27 involved writing this book \u201cFrom my stance as a trauma therapist, it is heart-breaking to see the damage Donald Trump is wreaking upon American society. It is a perpetration, creating deep wounds from which, I fear, it will already take us years to heal\u201d\n\nHe had a difficult intense father, a known racist to those he did business with, excluding blacks. He never saw anything wrong with his father\u2019s racist business practices. His Sympathy with white nationalists is due to his father. His father was proud of him at a young age when he both ripped off a salesman and his father, when his father was to buy him a baseball glove -inflated the price and had the salesman in on it (gives you an idea of what being in this family was like). Again, his father was further impressed after opening a non-return item and then conning a return for cash on the item.  Pleasing his father did not translate into a health way to treat others. Identifying with an aggressor (his father) it shaped his future behaviour. With the beginnings of narcissistic tendencies, he was shipped off to military school at 13. Always hid his insecurities of fear and weakness by trying to be seen as powerful, &amp; \\*tries\\* to believe he is. This defence mechanisms created in childhood is still in effect today. He does not understand the impact of his behaviour &amp; is insensitive to it. When asked in 2016 what his father would say about him running for president, he replied \"He would let me do it\" at 70+ years old he answered as if he was an adolescent in a battle\/competition with his father. He places his father on a pedestal, at same time wanting to knock him off to take his place to feel special, as he sees his father as special, in order to cover up negative beliefs of himself, at same time feeling it\u2019s a place he does not deserve (this is broad as most people suffer from this in different ways). After winning the election he could not be found for hours, during an interview with 60 minutes, he responded \u201cI realized this is a whole different life for me.\u201d as if he never imagined actually winning. Here the psychiatrist says \u201cDid he really want to win? \u201cOne wonders if he even had a victory speech prepared at all.\u201d The strengths that got him elected do not ensure success in that position, he is incapable of delivering what the people want, evidence of this is his lying &amp; distortion. His macho image is empty &amp; he is unable to deal with himself or learn how to do his job without being defensive and aggressive with those who disagree with him. His upbringing does not fit with being in office. Apart from his less than pure business success, he is entirely without qualification for the presidency.

We must persuade people of our cause. This isn't inherently dirty, and the difference lies in that we will not be disingenuously tricking them. Our rhetoric is to save them, to save all humanity from its fetters.\n\nHow did FAI Spain inoculate its community against the rhetoric of the tycoons of industry (fascism, imo), and spread the love of self-determination and freedom? How did FAI Spain ever come to exist? Newspapers, media. Lots of media that was spread.\n\nIf we want to fight them, I think the absolute first tactic is to TEACH them. You can argue that you won't reach many, but I think that is a cynical and self-defeatist attitude and that it should be abandoned before you begin, or you have already doomed all reason and hope to failure (in your mind). Those who can be inoculated will be inoculated this way, those who can be treated will be treated this way, those who are resistant to treatment should have every possible manner of alternative methodology attempted (that you can). Then we arrive at the next step:\n\nIf you cannot teach them, you shame them. It's a non-violent and extremely effective social motivator across a spectra of domains. You remember when you were a teenager? What did you fear most in the world? For many people, it was humiliation. Humiliation DESTROYS people in (what can be) a very productive manner, in my opinion. Mind you, this methodology requires that a significant amount of any social group be ready to engage in it for it to be \\*extremely\\* effective. How do we stop people from masturbating in public? Some say the law, I say the vast amount of that is obviously shame related. I know, an extreme example. Shame, to my knowledge, is how all primitive humans managed to maintain Anarchism in their societies. Those with big heads get knocked down a peg. Those who don't work? Well, can they? Yeah, let them know that. Together now!\n\nThe next step would be exile. Complete removal from social contact. Humans DIE in isolation. Literally. There are almost no humans that CAN live in a cave. It is forceful (yet potentially non-violent and in no way absolutely 'violent' method) method, but it solves the problem. Permanently. (or for however long society needs it to work) This is harder to do in our society, but is done more in Britain (I hear). A fascist there will have (basically) no friends in his community. If he goes around saying 'f'n 'race' this' and 'f'n 'race' that' then he has no friends. They do not associate with him, they do not allow him to be in their space, they do not go around him, they do not acknowledge him when he says hello, they do not acknowledge his existence. I know a lot of people like to act tough, but if it is a significant majority, this destroys most psyches. They will be \\*FORCED\\* to reassess their action (or go form a terror cell with their little buddies, in which case self-defense and the next step come in:)\n\nThe final step, in my little system of logic here, is defense. If these prior three have not worked, you are only left with this one. If he cannot be reasoned with, he cannot be shamed, he cannot be told to go away...well. If he's still a problem...yeah. Justifications vary here. My line is when people attack. I realize it's not a solid line, but I have a solid argument for it. Basically it goes like this:\n\nViolence is the absolute and purest form of actual oppression. Entering into any form of violence has a MASSIVE burden of proof to justify it. The easiest and least controversial justification has always been self-defense. Why is this practically relevant as well as morally? Because:\n\nIf we do not have the numbers to use the above four steps morally, we do not have the numbers to win. Period. If you want to 'fight the power' in a militant sense, you \\*MUST\\* consider it militarily. You see how FARC won that guerrilla war? Yeah, they didn't. Violence cements the common people against us (logically, morally, and practically; if we are the initiators). It is the very foundation of the condemnation of Anarchism in almost all rhetoric I have heard.\n\nYou want to win with guns? Why? That's the first question. If you can answer that satisfactorily then (and only then) can we move to: How? At least a sizable minority (!I DO NOT ADVOCATE THIS IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM! DO NOT!) destroying the centralized power. What is the problem with this idea, you may ask?\n\nOpportunistic vanguardism. You have a militant, organized (bureaucratic), blooded minority of any movement win over the previous authority and they will (in my opinion) WITHOUT FAIL become the new authority, and be militant, and bloodied. I have seen no exception to this. Ever. Once in power, the elites of the new vanguard do not give it up. At least one of them (perhaps crazed from war) will seize power. Generally the one with the loyalty (and rhetoric to control) the most troops leftover from the revolution. This is how Lenin destroyed Socialism (and democracy, and freedom, and for many...hope) in the infant Soviet Union. As far as I can see historically, this is a universally applicable principle. The Van may be your best mates, but when they're done being devils of war, killing people in their sleep (it would require MUCH murder, slaughter, TOTAL WAR to achieve a minority faction victory over both fascists and our government, or either) who will they be? At least one will be a devil, I'd wager; no matter how pure you think the conviction of your cause is. War is not a place for purity. War is not a place for sanity. War is not a place for anything but the absolute worst and most atrocious and despicable aspects of humanity.\n\nDid I go on a tangent? Sorry.\n\nFascists: Beating them? Don't. Assimilate them. Sunzi was right. Read Sunzi. That's all you need to know about warfare. Honest. Just destroy their plans, isolate them, don't feed them traction, spread our traction, win. Win by attacking plans and NOT waging war. If we must wage a war and win? You still have to spread traction or nothing like our movement will end up winning. Some perverse half-realized stunted version of it \\*MIGHT\\*.\n\nUltimately, ours is all about persuasion. Media, traction, logic, compassion. It's really...in no uncertain way...partially our fault (together as a society) that these kids are this way. I'm not saying individually...buuuut...our society failed them. I mean that \\*ENTIRELY\\*. Every one of those fascists is a victim not only of his tormenting of you but of his delusions tormenting himself.\n\nI went to high school in Southern Alabama. You would not believe me if I conveyed the truth of that place to you, most likely. It is abysmal. That high school DESTROYED MY MIND...not that it wasn't already cracked. I had to build myself a new one. Not the first time. It is a torture facility, as far as I'm concerned, posing as a daycare masquerading as a high school. It's a fucking prison. It's a nightmare. I have spent my life studying words and I have no words right now. You...it...we...that CANNOT remain.\n\nWe failed them in this way, and in others. Not you, not I, but not not you, and not not I. Not not our parents. Society is a crazy complex abstract concept. But that shit? It perpetuates this problem. They are trapped in delusions of tortured minds. I pity them.\n\nI do get it though, I REALLY do. I really do...\n\nNo one touches my daughter. No one. I get it.\n\nSummation: I am literally attesting that the media of freedom (and learning freedom, and doing freedom) will set us free. I am including fascists in the word 'us', yes. Anarchism is a movement for humanity. It is a movement without divisions or classes or races. It is a quasi-religious movement that states (to me in its most simple form, on a purely abstract level) \"I will not submit to you. You will not submit to me. I will not make you submit to me. You will not make me submit to you.\" Once this is established, what threat can possible exist between two people?\n\nSubmit here means...be made lesser. I submit in the bedroom, I dun give a fuck. I mean actual...oppression.\n\n[https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z0TLxsVrWEA](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=z0TLxsVrWEA)","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Four Methods of Fighting Fascists: Chomskian-Pacifist Anarchism""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"SYNA","title":"Four Methods of Fighting Fascists: Chomskian-Pacifist Anarchism"}

They believe it is morally more just to own property than not to. To have private property, private business, private corporations, private enterprise of all sorts. I think they believe it is more moral, however:\n\nI think they accept a fundamental differing quality that makes the outcome from 'market anarchism' and socio or colectivo or primitivo or syndicalist Anarchism very different. I am not certain the outcome \\*HAS\\* to be different, but I am telling you that if the model in my head is right, it ALWAYS works out one way and one way only.\n\nThe reason Proudhon argued, \"Property is robbery\" was precisely because if you allow (without limitations of any kind) wealth to purchase things, and you have an inequality of wealth, wealthy purchasers will possess more property. I get this doesn't sound particularly shocking at first, but please, I beg of you, bear with me for one more bridge. If you take this in practice; it means that a wealthy owner like Rockefeller can buy literally every square inch of arable land that is for sale, and own this land in all perpetuity. He can choose who has access, he can say that ten million peasant farmers born that way (due to the inequality of wealth) do not deserve to even be able to work for food. He can literally starve an entire nation, if he wants. If we take property as an absolute.\n\nI realize this argument is not \\*real\\* in a pure sense, but it is an important principled argument to demonstrate the single primary grievance with this system. In our government (modern republics and such)? That cannot happen. You can buy land, sure, but the government will not let you own a monopoly on all land. You can have a private enterprise, but the government will not let you be a monopoly that owns all opportunity in that field of enterprise. There have to be limits to the extremes of wealth in a wealth-based system.\n\nSocialism, whether or not it works in real life (I ardently believe I can easily prove it does), rejects wealth. It rejects property. Not your teddy bear, you keep that. Personal property isn't an issue. Your house is yours, the land you till is yours, in Anarchism. But this idea of institutionalized right to own everything if its for sale, in the hands of an ever-decreasing few, that is the core problem. In Socialism they simply eschew the concept of money. In socio-Anarchism, or Anarcho-communism. The way those societies work in principle is by simply removing money entirely. Most trade, too. You trade your labor for your local community in whatever way they need you to and you deem fit, and you get back the commodities they love to produce in return. That's the basic idea in practice.\n\nYou need shoes? This guy likes to make shoes. Go get some shoes from him. Do you trade anything? Not a thing. He makes shoes cause he really likes making shoes, and he likes serving his local community. What do you do to serve it? That depends. How do we make sure you don't sit around doing nothing in perpetuity to not serve your community? We shame you. Hey Bob, Bob, what'd you do today? Hey Bob, I see you got that nice fat steak. Hey Bob! I haven't seen you at the town hall meeting, Bob, hey Bob! I see you got that new car, hey Bob! What do you do again? Sit at home all day? Do you write? Can I see it? Hey Bob! Would you care to lend me hand in my field?\n\nSocialism, at least left-leaning socialism (same as anarcho-cap, I reject right-wing socialism) assumes as a fact that most if not all humans feel shame, pride, and WANT to participate in theiir communities, if not coerced, if not made lesser, if not obstructed in other abstract and institutional ways. This principled moral idea is the SAME actually between right and left wing liberterians, they BOTH assume this. I just think wealth is the trick. Wealth without limits of any kind is inherently, logically, purely a bad idea. It ends in tragedy. I don't mean your wealth, I don't mean your personal triumphs in life that let you live well, I get that, I really do. I mean some generationally rich kid who just happened to be born into owning EVERYTHING. That is immoral on its face.\n\nI think we are the same, we just differ on 'property'. A key difference. And I think they get triggered a lot, too, honestly, by thinking we insist to 'steal' what they have. We do not. We insist that we all have the same right to work and get and be. Both of our traditions. So instead of listening to each other we end up bringing out the clubs of rhetoric we wield to beat each other over the head ad infintum.\n\nI have known many GREAT libertarians on BOTH sides.

That being said , I've always had a very tough time accepting the idea that veganism is a moral imperative and that vegans hands are cleaner than nonvegans. In my view, the self autonomy and sovreignty of animals is the full realization of animal liberation. Thus, capitalism, and perhaps civilization itself is antithetical to the freedom of animals, just as it is to humans. The whole vegan argument I think often misses this and is an excercising of agency where none actually exists-meaning, individuals thinking about what to buy\/eat or not to buy\/eat is misplaced because it's presmised on the notion that such things have any tangible impact on this societies antagonistic relationship to animals. IMO veganism is a symbolic gesture with little actual substance. Because both a vegan and a nonvegan are part of civilization and capitalism, aren't they both equally culpable from a big picture view? (With the industries and society themselves being the most guilty?) At the end of the day, both of our labor power and $$$$ goes to the same groups of people and powerhouses, seeing as how most companies are owned by the same people. And the whole supply and demand thing I think is silly point because vegans are too small a population to make any significant change relative to the global population. It's even sillier when we consider the increasingly urgent time frame we are on (climate change, environmental destruction, social stratification, societal collapse). I don't need convincing of animal liberation, in fact I think it's one of the most important ideas of our time. But I am not convinced that veganism makes any dent aside from a symbolic one or that our consumptive practices = praxis or moral standing. Thoughts???

Apologies for how late it is, I've needed a few days for self care.\n\nTo start, I'll run through a quick report back as it's next to impossible to find information on what happened despite the huge amount of media present.\n\nThe first rally of opposition was held in Freedom Plaza, the plaza in front of the building that was famous for hosting NPI events (before they quit due to the security risk of having antifascists show up). I don't have much info on that as I wasn't there, but from what comrades have said, there was between 2 and 3 thousand counter protestors there and the overall mood was pretty militant and radical. After this rally ended, participants made their way to various other marches and rallies specifically targeting the Fash as they entered DC. In addition to the huge noise rally at Lafayette park that drowned out the speakers, I know of at least three other large gatherings of counter protestors: A BLM march moving about downtown and making a mess of traffic to the event, a \"queer bloc\" which was a gigantic roving dance party, and a large (at peak probably 400 participants strong) black bloc that was blocking one of two entrances to the road to the Fash rally. Though I was briefly part of the queer bloc, I spent most of my time with the black bloc at the entrance, so the rest of the report back will be in regards to that.\n\nThe goal of the black bloc was originally to block the restricted road leading to Lafayette park to prevent Fash from being able to enter. However, the bloc was planned around the timeline of arrival put out by the Fash. The Fash arrived much earlier than expected so this vision was not realized. After a half hour or so of discussion through the consensus process it was decided that if the Fash were allowed to enter, they wouldn't be allowed to leave, and the bloc remained in place as the number of participants ballooned. \n\nThe next hour remained relatively calm, but tense. Comrades had conversations and hung out, a few chants and songs were sung, some folks brought in some barricade making materials and set up, but nothing crazy occurred the whole time. That being said, the media presence was heavy and viciously hostile. Reporters were pushing in and out of the bloc going out of their way to take pictures of people's faces in moments when facial features were exposed, they were asking for interviews with participants and when they were turned down they would aggressively harass the potential interviewees, and at one point when cops tried to break through with vans and bikes and the bloc marched to counter, the press literally made a wall in front of the march and refused to move. Keep this aggression in mind for the \"lessons learned\" portion of this post. \n\nAfter about an hour, an influx of cops arrived at the gate with the vans that they were transporting the Fash on and it became apparent they were going to try to break through the bloc. Everyone joined arms behind the barricade, and after an initial surge that pushed probably 15 feet into the bloc, participants were able to hold and push back, actually breaking past where the police had initially been holding the line. At this point the cops and vans turned around and headed for the other exit, I have no idea what level of resistance was present on that side. \n\nAfter it was clear that the cops were done with our exit, the bloc turned into a march with the goal of dropping folks off safely at metro stations so they wouldn't be harassed. The march had a very 'fuck cops' kind of tone, as we had seen hyper aggressive policing on the part of the Secret Service, and the shear amount of resources thrown at keeping 20 Nazis safe had pissed everyone off. Despite this, the march remained 'peaceful' for the most part. At some points a few people dragged newspaper stands in the street, but there was no destruction of property or anything of that nature. About half way through the march a scuffle broke out between a reporter that was harassing a comrade, getting in the way, and trying to get pictures of their face. As far as I know it just became a shoving match and nobody was hurt, and after about 30 seconds the march moved on. The march continued for another 6 or 7 blocks when MPD suddenly and without reason kettled the bloc and put an end to the march. Some folks were able to find an exit by hopping over a fence that was down an alley near where we were kettled, but the rest of us had 5 to 10 minutes of thinking we were going to be mass arrested for absolutely nothing. Over those 5 to 10 minutes I saw at least 3 separate affinity groups get hands on with some of the cops, not necessarily seeming like they wanted to break the kettle, but rather to just expend some anger that had been building all day. It's also worth noting the behavior of the police. Though there's no such thing as a good cop, MPD generally remain extremely neutral against people who are protesting, and will often provide escort through traffic even to unpermitted marches. The attitude of MPD in the kettle was entirely different. They were out for blood and looking to get their batons broken in. After about 10 minutes, cops opened up a corridor to let the remaining kettled folks out, and it gave me plenty of time to see just how extensive the police operation to stop the march had been. As we walked to one of the safe spaces, we passed two full blocks of police vehicles, easily 300ish cops, and as we cleared it, another 100 or so were arriving on bikes. Keep in mind that this was just one side of the kettle, I suspect that the other side was just populated by the Fash in blue. So all in all there were at least 700 cops committed to stopping a march that at that point was maybe 200 people strong; this is a huge divergence from MPDs protocols for handling special events, and what's more worrying is that it's coming only a year and a half after J20, when prior to that there was almost a decade of a more perceived \"neutrality\" (a big lack of a better word) towards marches.\n\nMy day pretty much ended there, and I have since taken a ton of time to consider what went well and what needs to change.\n\n\n\nWhat went well:\n\n1.) As someone who participated in the shit show that was Charlottesville 1, I was inspired by the heavy presence of affinity groups at the bloc in DC. That's not to say that AGs didn't exist in Cville, but at least 80% of the bloc in DC seemed like it was made up of independent AGs, which is exactly the direction we need to be going in. \n\n2.) Nobody was proactively hostile to the Fash in blue at any point, but we also refused to be fucked with. In my opinion this is the ideal way of dealing with cops at something like this. We all knew that we were severely outmatched by the cops, and the cops new this as well, however by waiting for the cops to be assholes and then refusing to let them push through us, we showed them that we're not a group to be fucked with and it's better for everyone involved if they just come up with a different plan.\n\n3.) The prominence of PPE. I remember after the surge of people involved in AFA after Trump's election, the standard dress code was a black hoodie, black mask, drawstring bag, and not much else. Almost everyone there on Sunday was wearing a helmet, eye pro, some sort of respiratory protection, and many groups went above and beyond with knee and or elbow pads, shields, and face shields like you would see in a machinist shop attached to their helmets. As someone who acts as a medic for their AG, this makes me immensely happy as the number of preventable injuries drops substantially with the addition of even basic PPE.\n\n4.) Camaraderie. As stated above, shit got hairy on more than one occasion. Despite this, everyone bound together to get each other through shit. During the ACB on J20, my AG tried to link arms with another AG, and that group refused for security reasons. Though I completely understand where they were coming from, this type of isolation will do nothing to get everyone through the shit together. Instead, when the cops would get aggressive, everyone would link up, the comrades behind the line would grab backpacks of folks they didn't know, and we fought back with overwhelming unity which overwhelmed aggression targeted at us. \n\n\nWhat we need to learn:\n\n1.) The press have gone from people we should be wary of to people of outright hostility. The level at which this has reached has seemingly come out of nowhere and is alarming at best. The past month has been filled with stories of reporters at various events around the US becoming aggressive in their \"pursuit of a story\" to the point where they severely violate personal autonomy, and then when someone reacts they flip the story to look like victims. This is going to become a major problem if left unchecked, which brings me to my next point:\n\n2.) We need to figure out what we're going to do about media. Though they're often the provocateurs, we can't just wantonly go hands on with reporters who are at events, but the level of disrespect for us cannot go unchecked either. I haven't been able to come up with any sort of solution to this, what do you think? What does your ideal \"press plan\" look like?\n\n3.) When we march, we should be less focussed on \"blob\" style marches and be more broken out into our affinity groups. This isn't to say marches wouldn't look the same from the outside, but a large group of people for the most part cannot counter a kettle being set up aside from charging headlong into it. However, if a kettle is in the process of getting set up, individual AGs can take on separate roles required to break the kettle EG: One group can block vans or bikes, two or three groups can look for exits, a few groups can push up to prevent cops on the ground from advancing to the point that the group gets surround etc. The black bloc is a beautiful thing, however, US police have had at minimum 20 years to adjust their tactics to dealing with it. It's time we adjust ours to make it so they can't silence us. \n\n4.) We need more eyes and ears on the ground in front of and behind marches and occupations. Kettles can be seen coming from blocks away, if you have a bike scout 4 blocks out from an intersection being held, and you have a decent comms structure set up with bloc participants, you have time to adjust yourselves in such a way that will make it significantly harder to get the group kettled. I know this infrastructure exists in some cities and localities, however it's high time we make it universal across the US. We've seen an increasingly heavy handed police response to leftist street action in this country, and we have to do something to start keeping our comrades safe. \n\nThat's all I got. It was a hell of a day, but I think in all it was an unmitigated victory on the part of the counter protestors. The city had to throw a ton of money and resources at the objective of keeping 20 nazis safe, and at the end of the day they got drowned out and the rally got cut short. Getting kettled was an incredibly retraumatizing event, and seeing the amount of cops there was terrifying, but at the same time, it tips the state's hand towards their fear of militant antifascist organizing, and that's an incredibly powerful feeling. Despite having an overwhelming monopoly on power, they couldn't control us until they had to triple our numbers to surround us at a point where everyone was worn out, soggy, and tired. They're losing their grip of control over us and they know it. ","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Unite the Right 2 DC: What We learned- A very late post"}

At the heart of this post is what it fundamentally means to be *free*, and whether or not an authentic libertarian society would grant people the freedom to deny others of freedom. I've been thinking about the ideas presented in that thread, so I'm just making this post to jot down some of my thoughts and spark some discussion on them.\n\n**Definitions**  \nLet me start with some definitions. In my opinion, freedom is synonymous with self-determination, the ability of an individual to possess complete control over their life. Oppression is defined as anything that restricts one's freedom\/self-determination. \n\n**A (somewhat) objective analysis**  \nNow let's objectively examine the paradox at the heart of this: the freedom to deny others of freedom. \nWe can call this the Paradox of Freedom, and construct it as follows. A libertarian society, seeking to abolish oppression in all forms, would, out of necessity, prohibit people from acting oppressively towards others. In the quest to abolish oppression, an anarchist society must deny people the freedom to behave oppressively; however, this falls under our definition of oppression. In other words, a libertarian society *must* act oppressively in order to abolish oppression. The Paradox of Freedom can be summarized as follows: A libertarian society must act oppressively (albeit to a very minute degree) in order to prevent its inhabitants from acting oppressively. This has parallels with Karl Popper's [Paradox of Tolerance](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Paradox_of_tolerance), which states that in order to create a tolerant society, one must be intolerant towards intolerance. \n\nI see three ways to logically reconcile the Paradox of Freedom, although there may be more:\n* 1. I've misdefined either freedom or oppression (or both), and because I use these words and their definitions to construct the paradox, my construction is invalid.\n* 2. The \"freedom\" to deny others of freedom (ie the freedom to act oppressively) is not an authentic freedom, and does not fall under the definition of freedom.\n* 3. A truly anarchist society, in which all forms of oppression have come to an end, is unachievable. Although we can come *extremely close* to achieving this ideal, fully authentic anarchism is literally unreachable.\n* 4. A truly anarchist society *is* achievable, and would grant its inhabitants the freedom to act oppressively. However, none of the inhabitants of this society would ever exercise this right, because if this right were exercised, the ideal of authentic libertarianism would be shattered. (this conclusion seems to be predicated on the assumption that the inhabitants of this society are perfect beings, so this one is probably just BS)\n\n**Why the paradox is wrong**  \nAfter entertaining the Paradox of Freedom for the last several hours, I've come to the conclusion that it is dead wrong. I've identified three reasons for this as follows (separated into paragraphs):\n\nFirstly, I now realize my definition of oppression was imprecise. This sub's [anti-oppression policy](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/wiki\/aop) defines oppression as\n&gt; \"any language or action that expresses, reinforces, upholds or sympathizes with any form of systemic social domination, including but not limited to: eugenics, patriarchy, cisnormativity, white supremacy, heteronormativity, capitalism, etc...\"  \n\nWould a libertarian society deny people the freedom to act oppressively? Certainly. Is that oppression? By this definition, no, allowing us to avoid the paradox. Denying people the freedom to act oppressively is a method of combating systemic social domination, which, by this definition, is the literal opposite of oppression.\n\nSecondly, it is crucial for every society, anarchist or not, to uphold basic rules. Consider, for a moment, a libertarian society with no rules whatsoever. During the initial stages of this society, people's self-determination would be limitless. However, as time went on, this society would mutate into an oppressive one; by virtue of being rule-less, people would have the right to deny others of freedom. The WSA [website](workersolidarity.org) explains it like this:\n&gt; \"It is not possible to have a society without institutions for the making of basic rules and enforcing these rules. A polity is whatever set of institutions play this role in society. A state is merely a certain kind of polity, a hierarchical polity that supports the interests of dominating classes. To liberate itself from class oppression, the working class must get rid of the state, not to replace it with nothing, which is impossible, but to replace it with a self-managing polity that empowers the mass of the people.\"\n\nThe purpose of rules in an anarchist society would be to secure the liberty of the masses, preventing individuals from denying the rights of others. For instance, there would be rules against murder (to defend one's right to life), rules against rape (to defend one's right to choose how to use one's own body and to defend one's right to dignity), traffic laws (to enforce one's right to be as safe as possible while driving), etc. Fundamentally, this means that **an authentic anarchist society would not grant its inhabitants unlimited freedom\/self-determination**. Unlimited freedom includes the freedom to deny others of freedom, and any society that grants people this freedom is wholly unworthy of the title \"libertarian\". Therefore, the goal of anarchism is not to achieve unlimited freedom; rather, the goal is to achieve liberty from all forms of oppression-- in order to achieve this goal, anarchist societies must necessarily place certain limits on people's self-determination.\n\nThirdly, it is clear that true anarchism must include the collective ownership of society's resources and assets, as anyone who cannot access the full wealths of their society is not free. In the tread that I described at the beginning of this post, OP (u\/m00py) left a [comment](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Anarchism\/comments\/972f92\/freedom_to_be_a_capitalist_is_freedom_nonetheless\/e46oro4\/?st=jkvsl8qe&amp;sh=70891e56) describing why true freedom *must* exclude the \"freedom\" to deny others of freedom:\n&gt; If you consider the notion that... no one is truly free until we all have unhindered access to basic resources and the collectively owned fruits of society (education, technology, science, art)... then the idea that true freedom MUST include the freedom to prevent others from taking part in the means of life - these social fruits - is a falsity. Moreover, including this falsity in a theory of true freedom not only negates freedom from ever really taking place, but it also necessitates that any accurate theory of true freedom MUST be this state of freedom-negation.\n\nAlthough OP touches on it, we can write a full proof as to why the \"freedom\" to deny others of freedom is is not a true freedom, and why any theory of authentic freedom must reject this \"freedom\". We construct the proof as follows: temporarily assume you are a fully autonomous individual. Your self-determination is unlimited, and you possess the freedom to deny others of freedom. There are two possible cases we can examine:\n\n* Case 1: You are the only individual in your society who has the freedom to deny others of freedom. In this case, you are nothing more than a tyrant who sits at the top of a hierarchy. As a result, you become a servant to your power; ergo, you are not truly free.\n* Case 2: You are not the only individual in your society who has the freedom to deny others of freedom. In this case, any other person who has the freedom to deny others of freedom may exercise this against you; ergo, you are not free.\n\nIn short, the \"freedom\" to deny others of freedom is a wolf in sheep's clothing- it is the denial of freedom under the guise of freedom. At best, the \"freedom\" to deny others freedom is a white lie; at worst, it is a toxic justification for mass oppression.\n\n**Lingering thoughts\/questions\/doubts I still have**\nAs an anarchocommunist, one of my core values is solidarity. Specifically, I think it is *imperative* for an anarchist social revolution to have unanimous mass support before we radically alter society. As Peter Coffin explains in this [video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/DuURejx4aLE)\n&gt; \"Dictating what socialism is and how to get there is authoritarian. Whatever we do to get to socialism has to be of the people, and for it to be of the people, the people have to be a collective... If a small group of people just said, 'Tomorrow, we're going to perform a revolution,' that would be authoritarian\" \n\nEssentially, if a small group of radicals were to fundamentally alter society without gaining mass support, that group would be imposing social change upon large numbers of people who had no desire for it. That's coercive. That's authoritarian. That is exactly why solidarity is a critical part of socialist and anarchist revolution; without solidarity, the lines between anarchism and authoritarianism become blurred. There is nothing anarchist about forcing a radical social revolution to occur when there isn't mass support for one. As Kropotkin himself puts it:\n&gt; \"This immense problem \u2014 the reorganisation of production, redistribution of wealth and exchange, according to the new principles must be a natural growth resulting from the combined efforts of all interested in it, freed from the bonds of the present institutions. It must grow naturally, proceeding from the simplest up to complex federations; and it cannot be something schemed by a few men and ordered from above. In this last shape it surely would have no chance of living at all.\"\n\nI'm sure you and I can agree how important it is to be active in promoting solidarity. With that in mind, I think we should make a conscientious effort to try to convince others to join our cause; however, I also find it important to denounce those whose views reinforce and encourage oppression (ie fascism). \n\nOn one hand, there are many groups (liberals and centrists, for instance), whose views are not grounded in blind hatred (like fascism), yet still encourage, or at least condone, some forms of hierarchal oppression, such as the state and\/or capitalism. On the other hand, because liberals and centrists make up such a large volume of today's population, I think it would be beneficial to view them as potential allies, people we can convince to join our cause through the use of enough propaganda. This is where I have some personal confusion, and would like to hear anarchist discourse on liberals. Because both ideologies condone oppression to some extent, the lines dividing liberalism and fascism often become blurred (that being said, I recognize fascism as much more dangerous than liberalism, and should thus be met with greater opposition). However, because there are so many liberals today, I think we would only be inflicting damage upon ourselves by immediately rejecting them and labeling them as \"enemies\", despite the fact that in many cases, liberalism is an inherently oppressive ideology. What are your thoughts on how anarchists should approach liberalism?","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"[long] What authentic freedom is, why solidarity is important, and a discussion about liberals and other similar groups"}

I won't reveal which because I have all the reasons to keep my privacy, I even use a VPN just to post this due to the recent atrocities that happen against workers, I fear for my safety and that of my family. I have a family that is increasingly harder to sustain, my wife works in a supermarket and we have a kid.\n\n\nI earn relatively well for the wages here because manufacturing jobs pay relatively well (actually the wages are shit), that is the only reason I can sustain my family, because while education and healthcare is not that expensive here, the mortgage and everyday costs are. We live in a small apartment building just enough to raise a child in and can sustain an older model car. This is a middle class lifestyle here, live in a shitty apartment and barely sustain 1 kid. Imagine half of the country is worse off.\n\n\nBut all of this comes through hard work. The steel factory is an awful job that I despise from the bottom of my gut, but I have to do this for my kid. It is summer now, very hot outside, but imagine how hot is inside the factory? If you guessed over 50 degrees Celsius, you are correct,not exageration, we have thermometer there. The working conditions are deplorable, and people get sick almost daily. The ambulance comes to us on an almost daily basis, and there we have lost 2 colleagues already who died in the hospital from a heart attack.\n\nThe working conditions are true HELL, and I have to work here up to 10 hours a day, sometimes on Saturdays too just to sustain my kid. Sometimes 2 shifts, but I have stopped doing that as it was draining my life energy.\n\n**Where are the regulators?** We have labor regulators and inspectors and other cockroaches, but guess what? They come by once a month and they rub the boss's balls and that's it. Yes sometimes they fine him for bad working conditions and write a \"concerned report\" but nothing comes out of it. Everone in the town knows how shitty this workplace is from their infamy but everyone just shrugs their shoulders.\n\nSo the regulators just come by and slap him on the wrist with a tiny fine like about 4000$, that is a lot of money here so not that small ,but you know the boss makes a lot more than that. So that is your labor regulation, they just write a report where they put their \"concerns\" and a small fine, and all is well. It doesn't matter that workers get sick and die, their lives don't matter.\n\n**Where are the unions?** We don't have those ladies and gentlemen. We only have those for government jobs like police and education and other scum. Private unions are practically nonexistent. There were people who tried to form unions but you don't want to guess what happens to them.\n\nSo nobody cares about us, and maybe 60-70% of workers work in the private sector, while the rest are in education , police or bureaucrats, yet we have zero representation while they have all.\n\n\n**So what's up with the heat in the factory?** This being said, I have asked some friends who were mechanics, they said that if the boss would put a ventilation system then the heat could be drastically lowered down to normal heat, like 30 degrees Celsius, which is probably still much for a lot of you spoiled westerners, but that would be paradise for us. They even did some calculations, we estimated that it would cost no more than 15000$ (at maximum) to install it.\n\nBut the boss just simply won't do it. Which is ironic because he was already fined at least 3 times, so he paid at least 12000$ already in fines, but he just can't spare 15000$ for the well being of the workers.\n\nHe would rather pay fines, and even pay more in fines, than to do a 1 time expense to improve the work conditions, because to him we don't matter, we are just cockroaches in his eyes. Doesn't matter if all the workforce dies, as long as there are other workers out there, he won't care, and there are many out there, as the unemployment rate is over 35%.\n\nOnce I was in the office for some paperwork, you guessed his office has air conditioning, and it's next to the main factory building so he stays everyday in his office scracthing his balls, and he sometimes comes over into the main building and always complains about the heat, as a joke, as in a mocking way to like make fun of us. Sometimes it really makes you get the urge to punch him in the face, when he comes over with his smug smile and starts making fun of us and ridiculing us. One of my colleagues is gay, he is openly gay, and he sometimes wears pink (gayness is not illegal here yet). And sometimes when the boss comes over he always picks on my gay colleague with homophobe jokes like \"how was that cock in your ass last night\" and remarks like that. I even asked him why does he tolerate all this abuse against him? And he said that he just needs the money like me, so he will just be quiet and take all the discriminatory slurs because this is the only relatively good paying manufacture job, otherwise you can just go and beg on the streets. And in other factories they beat up gay people as he told me, at least here he is just verbally abused.\n\n(sorry for long side tangents but I just have a lot on my mind to speak about)\n\nSo when I was in the office, I accidentally saw his monthly report on the desk, because of the clumsy careless secretary. I wasn't supposed to see that, because it clearly showed that in the last month, this was in March, the factory made a profit of 420,000$. Yes he pocketed fucking half a million $, monthly, and this motherfucking scumbag can't pay 15000$ extra for a ventilation system to make worker conditions better. It just made me so angry after I saw that, so of course he won't make that public. These scumbags never tell you how much they earn, while my salary is 250$ a month. Piece of shit feudal lord.\n\n\nSo as you see I live in a capitalist utopia. Horrible working conditions, low wage, extreme abuse and discrimination in the workplace, and if you talk back you are fired or worse. Sometimes they forget to pay 1-2 days or the salary is delayed by 1 week, but it's all fine because if you complain, you are fucked even more.\n\nI have heard rumors about a different factory, a shoe factory, that is also owned or partly owned by this scumbag, where the workers are mostly women. And he did lock the women in there for 2 hours extra and didn't let them leave until they finished their work, as they were behind schedule. Yeah try calling the police on him, the police will come and beat the women up actually. They are all in on it, fucking pieces of shit.\n\n------------------------\n\n\nYou know the most disgusting part? I live in a Social Democracy. Yes you heard that correctly, the ruling party is social democrat. We have a 2 party system:\n\n* the Liberals which is is just liberal in name only, they are a theocratic ultra-conservative religious fanatics for the rural population, but hey at least they allow abortion and they haven't banned gayness yet, but there are ultra theocratic nutjubs there that want to. These are open feudalists\/capitalists.\n* And the social democrats who are in government now\n\nNow the social democrats are scum. They are pieces of shit. Why? Because all they do is just bribe government employees and maybe raise pensions here and there.\n\nGovernment workers get their salary increased almost 2 times a year, they have unions, and all kids of benefits, paid leave and such. And sometimes they give some gifts to the pensioners.\n\nThat is the social democracy, everything for government workers (30% of population) and nothing to the true working class that has to sweat daily in shitty jobs like mine.\n\nYes they sometimes increase the minimum wage, but guess what happens? They just lay people off who happen to produce below that. The steel factory just laid off 200 people last year when the minimum wage was increased.\n\nAnd we have no welfare system only a small one so they are fucked at every turn. If you lose your job here that is as good as a death sentence because only a few select people get welfare or if you pay off the doctor.\n\nThe place is a cesspool of corruption and misery, and while we have socialized healthcare and pensions and paid maternal leave, their quality is very low.\n\nWhen my kid wa born she got only 1 year paid maternity leave, and the sum was so low 30% of he previous salary, that I had to work 2 shifts and I could not even see my kid. \n\n**I could not spend time with my child because I had to work all day and I was very tired when I got home and had to sleep!!!!!!**\n\nThe conditions in the hospital are disgusting. The maternal ward rooms had mold on their walls and the tap water in the hospital was brown. They don't spend anything on infrastructure they just pocket all the tax money for themselves, these scum politicians.\n\n\nThis is social democracy here, the government scumbags get all the benefits, a little bit of socialized healcare and a thow a few bones to the people and the rest of it is stolen. The government is totally corrupt and politicians constantly steal tax money. \n\nMenwhile regular workers get nothing, minimum wages create more unemployed people, no unions, shitty working conditions and the boss maing 400,000$ monthly while we die due to the heat in the workplace.\n\n\nI am saying this because I have also followed US politics and I saw that a lot of \"social democrats\" are running there in your next elections, and I assume a lot of you here are from the US.\n\nLook I am no expert in US politics so I don't want to judge ahead of you, it's just the news that aggressively report on this.\n\nBut if this is the social democracy they want, then may God have mercy on you, and you will get is rampant corruption and more abuse.\n\n\nFrom my experience social democracy is just a big spiked dick in my asshole, it fucks me every day. It's just a trojan horse for capitalist extremism, and the social democrats are enabling the capitalist atrocities this way.\n\nAt least the Liberals here are open about their bullshit, we know that they will fuck us, but the SocDems are scum, they steal with 2 hands and give it back with 1 hand, so they become popular. Just pay off the teachers and the police and it's a socialist utopia, meanwhile the steel workers are dying due to the heat.\n\n**Fuck social democrat criminal accomplices and fuck capitalist pigs.**\n\n\n\n\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"My experience with social democracy"}

She has recently published an amazing book titled [\u201cYemen in Crisis: autocracy, neoliberalism, and the disintegration of a state.\u201d](http:\/\/www.saqibooks.com\/book\/yemen-crisis\/) It will be published in the US by Verso books next June. She regularly contributes to [Open Democracy](https:\/\/www.opendemocracy.net\/author\/helen-lackner).\n\nI recently asked her these questions:\n\n1. **Talk about Yemen\u2019s recent past and how it got to where it is today. How did the civil war start, and why did the Saudis, Emirates, Americans, all get involved?**\n\nThe 2011 popular uprisings in Yemen were longer and larger than almost anywhere else.  They persisted for years, rather than weeks, and took place throughout the country, in the capitals of all governorates, even in small towns.  On 18 March,  forces of then President Ali Abdullah Saleh attacked the regular Friday post-prayer march and killed more than 50 demonstrators.  This led to a formal split in his regime, with leaders of the opposition parties, particularly Islah, turning against him and stating openly their support for the youth revolution.  General Ali Mohsen, leader of an important and powerful military unit, also joined the revolution.  This had a number of consequences\n\n* First that the \u2018independent\u2019 youth, including many members of opposition parties, lost control over the \u2018change squares\u2019 as the sites of the live-ins were called.  This was the case mainly in Sana\u2019a, but also elsewhere.  It led to a narrowing of the focus of the movement and certainly to a weakening of women\u2019s role and participation.  Islah is a conservative Islamist party which is composed of two main groups, northern conservative tribesmen and the Yemeni version of the Muslim Brotherhood;  although both welcomed women as followers, neither was very keen on women leaders or on women and independent youth acting independently .\n* Second, this change led to an increasing military conflict between Saleh\u2019s forces and those of the formal opposition.  Though these conflicts happened elsewhere than the Change Squares, they became the dominant events as far as most of the population was concerned, as well as the international community, and distracted from the popular movement.\n* Third, the International Community, represented in Yemen by a group of ambassadors from the main world powers and the Gulf Cooperation Council came to the conclusion that the Saleh regime was no longer viable and an alternative had to be found.  They therefore supported what became known as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Initiative, which itself became the GCC Agreement on 23 November when it was finally signed by Saleh at a ceremony in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe GCC Agreement led to the presidential elections of February 2012 which were uncontested and brought Abdo Rabbo Mansour Hadi to the presidency for a two-year transitional period.  During this time, the country was to be run by a Government of National Unity composed 50% of Saleh\u2019s political organization, the General People\u2019s Congress and 50% by a combination of the formal opposition,  the most important of which was Islah, and the \u2018new forces\u2019 emerging from the uprisings, namely women, youth and civil society.  This was a formula for failure.\n\nOther elements of the transition included a National Dialogue Conference \\[NDC\\] which would set the basis of a \u2018new\u2019 more democratic Yemen and would lead to a committee drafting a new constitution based on the findings of the NDC.  A third and most important element, was a security sector reform intended to turn these sectors into institutions responding to the needs of the state, rather than those of their previous patron, president Saleh.  All these were to operate simultaneously to stick to the 2-year timetable established by the GCC Agreement, another fundamental error.  Security Sector reform should have come first, thus enabling any new regime to enforce its decisions.  Moreover, these discussions were supported by the US, which had a vested interest in the previous security sector leadership and units as it had been supporting them with training and equipment since the 2001 events in the US.  It therefore did little to push for a reform which would exclude these elements.\n\nWhile these discussions were going on, the transition unravelled, failing to provide any improvements in living conditions for the people as the international community did not produce the funds for economic development and social institutions. A series of terrorist incidents also killed many. Most importantly, the Huthi movement (which had achieved its latest cease fire with the Saleh regime in 2010)  simultaneously participated in the political process and gained control over territory on the ground, controlling its home governorate of Saada and expanding west, south and east beyond it.\n\nIt also developed its alliance with its former enemy Saleh, and so benefited from the weakness of the transitional regime, taking over the capital, Sana\u2019a, in September 2014.  By January 2015, as the Hadi regime refused to bow to yet another set of demands, the Huthi movement formally took over state institutions, put Hadi and his main ministers under house arrest, resulting in an open civil war. The following month saw them moving southwards towards Aden which, after his escape there,  Hadi declared to be the interim capital, so was forced out of there and into exile in Saudi Arabia.  His call for assistance from the GCC states and the Arab League led to the direct intervention of the Saudi-led coalition on 26 March 2015 and the internationalisation of the war.\n\nSaudi and Emirati involvement was originally due to their concern about a Huthi take over.  However with the failure of air power, and the increasing duration of the war, claims of Iranian involvement have become louder and more frequent, displacing the original aim of restoring the \u2018legitimate\u2019 government to power.  It is also worth noting that both these regimes are absolute monarchies and less than enthusiastic at the presence of a republic in the Peninsula.  Without going into details, while the Republic of Yemen under Saleh was by no means a fully functioning democracy, it provided far more than mere lip service to the concept, with a real and active set of opposition parties.\n\nUS original involvement in Yemen has primarily focused on Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)  which it considers a threat to its interests, despite it being a movement of limited significance which has killed far more Yemenis than anyone outside the Arab world.  In recent years, the Obama regime was extremely indulgent with the Saudi regime, supporting it without challenge, largely to compensate for Saudi and Emirati anger at US signing of the nuclear agreement with Iran, the JCPOA.  Under Trump, in addition to drone and other attacks against AQAP,  priority is given to selling weapons, ammunition and providing technical support to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, all of these providing significant profits for US companies and institutions, let alone contributing to the Trump demonization of Iran.\n\n**2. Though they are allied, what are the differing goals of the Saudis and Emirates in Yemen? What are their respective end games?**\n\nAlthough there are clear differences between the Saudi and Emirati regimes in daily practice in Yemen, their end games are not significantly different.  Both are currently focused on Iran and accusing it of being the real force behind the Huthis.  Describing the Huthis as \u2018Iran-backed\u2019 has a number of advantages:  first it strengthens support from the Trump administration which, as we all know, consider Iran to be its prime enemy\u2026.  Second, given the failure of the Saudi-led coalition to defeat the Huthi movement, equipped with a few ancient Scuds \\[possibly upgraded with Iranian targeting technology\\] and the weapon arsenal of the Saleh regime,  involving Iran provides a more acceptable explanation to their publics for their impressive lack of achievements in the past three and a half years.\n\nDifferences are mainly tactical and practical:  the UAE forces are focused on the south and firmly support the separatist movement, controlling it up to a point.  They also have troops on the ground involved in fighting and are actively training a range of Yemeni forces.  The Saudis have no troops fighting on the ground,  their only forces there are those \u2018mediating\u2019 between the UAE supported elements and the Hadi government.  The Saudis cooperate with Islah  and have done for decades while the UAE refuses to see anything other than their bogey \u2018Muslim Brotherhood\u2019 in the movement and therefore oppose it vehemently.  This has the side-effect of putting them in different positions with respect to Hadi, supported by Saudi Arabia and opposed by the UAE who only see the Islahi elements in his government, in particular his vice-president.\n\n**3. In American media at least, it is often said that the Huthis are an Iranian Proxy. Can you talk about the facts and subtleties of Iranian involvement and why the Huthis may be portrayed in Western media as Iranian proxies?**\n\nIran supports the Huthis in Yemen, however, its involvement is far less than claimed by the Saudi-led coalition or indeed the Hadi government.  Huthis rarely do what others tell them to.  Some have had some ideological training in Iran, and there is a tendency to transform Zaydi Islam to be closer to that of Iranian twelver Shi\u2019a Islam, with the celebration of religious occasions according to those rites, occasions which are not significant in Zaydi rite.\n\nSome Iranian factions gain propaganda advantage from the claims made about their involvement, but there has been no firm evidence of the presence of either Iranian or even Hezbollah people in Yemen.  Whenever the coalition has made claims about killing or arresting Iranians, no evidence was produced to support the assertions, either in the form of ID cards, uniforms or corpses.\n\nIn addition, after having failed to defeat a small group with ancient weaponry, the coalition needs to claim Iranian involvement to justify their inability to win this war rapidly.  The Huthi missiles fired into Saudi Arabia are basically east European or North Korean Scuds obtained in Saleh\u2019s days, which have been upgraded and improved to increase their range, quite likely with some Iranian support.\n\n**4. Can you talk about the significance of Hodeida?**\n\nHodeida and Saleef are Yemen\u2019s main ports where the majority of food, fuel and other goods essential to the population\u2019s survival arrive. It has been blockaded for most of the duration of the war with only limited supplies being allowed in after verification from the UN as well as, often, further delays caused by Saudi checking.  The port is essential to ensure arrival of basic food and therefore both to commercial and humanitarian shipping.\n\nHaving abandoned the proposed offensive on Hodeida in 2017,  the coalition has this year started it.  Contrary to expectation \\[as indeed in the case of the war in general\\],  things have not gone according to plan.  As of mid-August, two months after the beginning of the offensive, it is \u2018on hold\u2019  supposedly to allow the UN Special Envoy to find a solution.  The Huthis have agreed to hand over the port to UN management, something which they rejected a year ago.  However the Hadi government and coalition have rejected this, demanding complete Huthi withdrawal from the entire governorate, ie surrender.  This means that there is at present no way of establishing the seriousness of the Huthi movement\u2019s willing ness to hand over the port to international management, and thus ensure that delivery of basic humanitarian aid to the millions on need.  The offensive, when it resumes,  is likely to cause thousands of casualties, mainly among the 400 000 or so remaining civilians in Hodeida, as well as prevent the delivery of food and other necessities to Hodeida and beyond to the densely populated highlands, where millions are in increasingly desperate need.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that there has been no evidence of weapons being smuggled through Hodeida, whether from Iran or anywhere else.\n\nHodeida is now temporarily off the headlines, with the massacre of a busload of children in Saa\u2019da on Thursday 9 August, which killed more than 40 children and at least ten adults, and which has caused an international outcry as these occasional \u2018mistakes\u2019 by the coalition do. One difference here, is that the coalition spokesman has claimed this to be a \u2018legitimate\u2019 target and not a mistake.\n\n**5. Since 2015, Yemen has been subjected to a U.S.-backed Saudi-led assault plunging it into the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. Three years later, has Yemen reached the point of no return? If so, can Yemen as a society and nation survive?**\n\nThe war has worsened the fragmentation of an already very weakened society and polity.  Southern Separatists, regional forces elsewhere including jihadi forces,  the  absence of a central state, have all affected the future of Yemen as a nation.  One thing is clear:  whatever emerges from this war when it finally ends, will be a different political entity from the Republic of Yemen which existed from 1990 to 2015.  It will also not be the two states which existed in that geographical area prior to that time. It is also likely to be far more directly under the political, social and financial influence of the GCC states, in particular Saudi Arabia and the UAE\n\n**6. Why has there been little media coverage of Yemen?**\n\nThis is limited for a number of reasons:  the country is remote and little known.  In the case of Europe, unlike Syria, it is not providing the \u2018threat\u2019 of the arrival of millions of refugees across its borders.  The situation in Yemen is complex.  In addition, there is little doubt that the Saudi and Emirati financed Public Relations organisations are contributing to keeping Yemen out of the public eye. Finally, the Governments of the US, UK and others, given their ambiguous positions \\[selling arms, supporting the coalition, while deploring the humanitarian consequences of the war, and financing humanitarian assistance\\], also prefer to see the war ignored.\n\n**7. What can US and UK citizens do to end their government\u2019s complicity in the bloodshed of Yemenis?**\n\nIn the US the Congress has taken a far more active and leading role in challenging US military involvement and support for the coalition.  Its latest military procurement law, if applied, would effectively restrict US practical support.  US citizens should actively support their representatives in both Houses in their efforts to take control of the government\u2019s actions, put an end or restrict arms sales and increase humanitarian and development support to the Yemeni people.  For those members already active, this would encourage them to continue and strengthen their position, for others, it might help them realise that there is opposition to the US role in the war and that taking a sane position on the war might increase votes.Note: if in-flight refueling of the aircraft carrying out the strikes was stopped, these air strikes would come to a very rapid end.  Other logistical support by US official and private forces is also essential to the continuation of the war and that includes maintenance of aircraft and other activities. UK citizens should do more to make their Parliament more active, at the moment its actions lag way behind those of the US\n\n**8. What do you see as the future of the conflict in Yemen? Any predictions?**\n\nThere is very little prospect for the war to end in the near future.  Saudi Arabian rulers and Hadi\u2019s government intransigence and determination to maintain UNSC resolution 2216 mean that the UN Special Envoy has no effective room to manoeuvre and thus he is constrained in his efforts to achieve any negotiation success, regardless of his willingness or skills. The \u2018talks about talks\u2019 he has announced for 6 September are unlikely to achieve much, even if they happen, which is uncertain.\n\nIt is sad beyond words to have to say that it looks as if this war is likely to continue for a significant period, as the Huthis are not about to be defeated, short of a miracle.  This means that the millions of Yemenis who only want peace and an end to their suffering are unlikely to see their hopes fulfilled in the short, or even medium, term.","subreddit":"chomsky","title":"Yemen Interview with Helen Lackner""num_comments":0,"score":2,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Yemen Interview with Helen Lackner"}

{"author":"remove_zedong","created_utc":1534745755,"num_comments":3,"score":29,"selftext":"This shouldn't be a long post, I don't think at least. This may be difficult to folllow, as I wrote it in the moment on my phone. I thought I should briefly explain some tactics I employ and why they are useful when dealing with fascists and proto-fascists. We all know that fascists use dogwhistles. This is coming from a former fascist. Fascism creates a pretty facade over a half-standing house and it is our job to tumble the house. I hope you all find this post and my perspective valuable. \n\nWhite supremacists become identitarians who just happen to be white. If black identitarians are okay, why not white? They assume that we must accept A because you accept B. What I suggest is that you, at least rhetorical, reject, deconstruct, and otherwise poke at B to combat A. There are certainly problems with this, but we need to tear down their \"gotcha\" wall. It is necessary.\n\nSecondly, there is the problem of avoiding their stereotypes (screaming red haired woman) while also not giving them the illusion of legitimacy. I personally like to mock them, but there are problems with this as they stereotype it more often than not. This is where my two points tie together: keep denying their essentials, in whichever way you see fit. \n\nDon't argue against them, tear away their argument. Mock it. Point out that \"white\" does not exist, \"european\" does not exist, etc. If they have dogwhistles and try to draw a comparison with a value they believe to be beyond criticism, criticize it. If they claim to be identitarians, tear down the concept of identity. Avoid giving them a key on the phenomenological reality of identity for some. To us, that despite there being no blackness, there is a phenomenological blackness. This reality can harm, but when subverted can help. They do not understand this. They do not understand that the phenomenological reality of whiteness can only help them and harm others, while phenomenological blackness does not. Phenomenological whiteness makes me white despite me not being so. Phenomenological whiteness turned our once powerful non-white Scots-Irish allies from decolonial icons into \"white identitarians\" and neoliberals. \n\nIn conclusion, I suggest that you take these tactics to their spaces. They can come here and run away, but bring it there and it is seen by far more. And again, do not try to \"logic them\" out of their position. Essentially gaslight them. I did not come to a sudden realization one day from a leftist pointing out that the evidence shows that race is a construct. I rationalized. That is how fascism sustains itself. There is a wonderful epistemology article I read on rationalization and the flaws of reason in argumentation that I would cite if I weren't two hours away from my bookshelf. What I think happend is I began to hear about Stirner, then read a bit of Stirner, but mostly secondary sources. I gaslit myself. My worldview slowly died because what I thought was real turned out to not be. I cannot say that this will work on everybody, because it definitely won't (rationalization is reinforced through a sort of group testimony. If multiple people confirm something, and you find them trustworthy, ideas that felt wrong at one point become allowed. This is why you should not give their ideas further credit, as that is how it is reinforced.) I think that a basic education on epistemology should be central to all theoretical leftists. \n\nAn example of the process of rationalization and \"de-rationalization\" described above: I became a fascist on 4chan. When I first began browsing, when I was maybe 16, I saw a homophobic comic and it made me sick. I almost left there. Constant exposure to similar content, often softened through comedy or less jarring art, numbed me to that content, for better or for worse. As that happened, the constant exposure normalized it for me. It went from a joke to the real thing. Maybe it was self-loathing, since I thought I was just gay back then. I was fed all sorts of arguments as to why homosexuality is wrong and dangerous. I'm sure you've heard them. Popular fears of \"degeneracy\" were used to spread the propaganda. Depictions of homosexuals as bug-chasers, pedophiles, \"freaks\". Eventually I spread the propaganda that once gave me a visceral reaction against it. Evidence against the statistics I was fed did not change my mind. Pointing out flaws in the statistics did not change my mind. A total epistemic breakdown changed my mind. In short, \"be gay do crime\" used to be something I feared, now it is something I live. These ideas spread like colonization. Decolonization does not come from arguing with the colonizers. They will not give up what they have. It comes from attacking them, destroying their infrastructure, and reclaiming through group action. Direct action and deconstruction not electoralism not reformism not internal solutions.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"A (not so) brief word on tactics, rhetoric, and dogwhistling"}

It felt like everyone on the left to right spectrum became a defender of western values over night and suddenly everybody could jump on the hype train of standing for freedom of speech which culminated in the absurdity of some of the most disgusting fundamentalist religious figures, as well as right and left elites celebrating solidarity against the bigotry of islamistic terror. The religious conservatives had a great opportunity to regain a white west as well as claim sympathy of the political center\/left and parts of the right.\nThe ones to call out the hysterical hypocrisy of \"Je suis Charlie\" were condemned as enemies of freedom of speech. The media (although I dislike the stigmatization this term implies) was heavily loaded with emotion and the public was paralysed in their attempt to start a dialog. \nThe political right had finally found their unifying scapegoat for all the horrors in the world and even the left had to adapt to that climate to take an unreflected anti-islamic stance. Discussing christian bigotry could finally be abolished as well as the dangers of right extremist terror. \nI remember from my time in the military (6 months compulsory in Austria, please forgive me) how we were taught that islamistic terror posed the biggest threat for the public safety in Austria, although I do not remember a single terroristic that has happened in Austria in probably ten years, whereas right wing violence has significantly increased. Speaking of putting refugee camps on fire, violence against jews etc. I also remember involuntarily taking part in conversations about austrian\/western values and how immigrants would not partake in our culture. But as it turned out, according to them I wouldn't be Austrian either as I am not an alcoholic, right wing, pseudo-religious, sexist, homophobic, nationalist that has violent ressentiments against his wife. (My country has the highest femicide in europe, at least something we are number one in) \nAnd being in the military and listening to the opinions of many comrades I slowly reduced my own anti-islamic prejudice. The notion that muslims are all sexist, antidemocratic, religious bigots etc. changed in so far as that *even if these things were all true* my own \"people\" have no right to put themselves above as they share these chauvinistic values just as much as they accused the muslims to have.\n\"Western values\" feels like a concept that has become more and more vague and can be perverted by anyone to serve their own political agenda and the left has become afraid to make use of the term for the right has folded this term accordingly and giving its usage a conervative taste to it. \n\nFor me western values\/tradition\/philosophy whatsoever are represantative of the ability to point out bigotry and injustice within your own midst. It's not the judeo-christian values that determine western culture, it's the culture that has grown out of abolishing and combating the status quo. Western philosophy has to be acknowledged as a paradox as for every ideology there is an ideology opposed to it. Capitalism, communism, anarchism, (anti-)imperialism, this list could continue forever, are all inherently western (correct me if I'm wrong) and for every aspect of western culture there is a counter culture involved.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the topic?\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Thoughts on \"western values\""}

(Of course I suppose if these plants were the targets of weapons this could still be problematic) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few of the designs could be scaled down to service small communities, rendering them energy-independent (so long as the materials needed were communally controlled) \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, the reason why I'm posting this at all is because of the high energy density that nuclear power offers as a solution to fossil fuels.  Wind, solar and tidal energy sources are fantastic as far as their non-polluting aspects are concerned, but storing that energy requires substantial leaps in battery technology (which ultimately uses non-eco friendly chemicals and the like, i.e. what do you do with all of the old batteries... etc, etc,).

In the first day we got word of actions coming out from the prisons from Halifax, Nova Scotia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington and Folsom Prison in California reported strike action.\n\nWe saw outside solidarity actions in at least 21 cities around the US and as far abroad as Leipzig, Germany. We saw Palestinian political prisoners give a statement of solidarity from their prisons in occupied Palestine.\n\nWe called this conference call because those of us who have been coordinating media relations on the outside have been overwhelmed by the number of reporters and outlets who are covering the strike. Some of us who were involved with media relations in 2016 can say that the difference is dramatic and we thank you for your interest in this prisoner-led movement. Many of you have the same questions and so we want to give you all an opportunity to hear our responses in one place.\n\nWe want to note that although there aren't widespread reports of actions coming out of prisons that people need to understand that the tactics being used in this strike are not always visible. Prisoners are boycotting commissaries, they are engaging in hunger strikes which can take days for the state to acknowledge, and they will be engaging in sit-ins and work strikes which are not always reported to the outside. As we saw in 2016, Departments of Corrections are not reliable sources of information for these actions and will deny them and seek to repress those who are engaged in them.\n\nWe have spoken with family members who have suggested that cell phone lines may be being jammed at multiple prisons in South Carolina, New Mexico had a statewide lockdown yesterday. The Departments of Corrections in this country are working overtime to try and prevent strike action and to try and prevent word from getting out about actions that are taking place.\n\nAs you report the strike, we encourage you to uplift the actions that we do know about, but also acknowledge that strikers may be resisting in ways that are tougher to quantify and view. We encourage outlets to issue FOIA requests to prisons that we believe will show attempts to quell the strike and also evidence of boycotts and other strike activity.\n\nWe also really want to remind the media that this strike is about ten different demands. While prison slavery has become a galvanizing force in the public eye, and it is a key element that prisoners are protesting against, they have given you ten specific demands and it is important to talk about all of them or report on them individually. People need to understand how truth in sentencing laws function, how gang enhancement laws function, and how the prison litigation reform act works and why these are things that prisoners are targeting their protest around. We need to be talking about the lack of rehabilitation programs, mental health care, and the lack of education programs and how this undermines the ostensibly rehabilitative nature of the prison system itself.\n\nPrisoners crafted these demands carefully through national organizing, based on the circumstances of the Lee Prison violence that occurred earlier this year, in an understanding of how the state brings about the conditions of violence like that, and the types of changes that are necessary to prevent that sort of violence from recurring. This is a human rights campaign and each of these demands should be understood through a human rights lens.\u00a0","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Strike update and statement to the press from the Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee"}

Transformative justice requires a radical re-imagining of the justice system and how we relate to one another. It is still a new concept that has contradictions in need of discussion. Let\u2019s have this critical discussion so that we can work towards a world that has no cops, prisons, or ICE.\n\n\n---\n\n--TW\/CW--\n\nThere is discussion and references to both racial violence and gendered traumas as well as to police brutality.\n\n---\n\n##Part 1: Types of Justice Systems\n\n---\n\n\n###1 - Punitive Justice System\n\n####The punitive justice system asks: *Was a law broken?* \n\nPunitive systems intervene when someone has broken a rule, rather than when someone has caused harm. In this system, the offended party is the state (cops, courts) not the survivor or the community. Punishments are pre-determined. It is important to note that not all acts of harm are a 'crime' meaning that serious and traumatizing forms of abuse like racism and gendered violence have no way to be addressed under this system. Also, not all crimes are 'acts of harm' but maybe protections for the interests of those in power.\n\n#####*How does the punitive justice system affect people who have been harmed?*\n\n* they lose their agency\n* burden of proof is put onto them, causing further trauma instead of healing or growth\n\n &gt; \u201cI am tired of so many others being shamed into silence. I am tired of a judicial system that generates more trauma than justice.\u201d \n\n &gt;&gt;*-Velouria Black, reflecting on her rape recovery in the essay THIS ONE IS MINE*\n\n* does not center their idea of \u201cjustice\u201d or their safety, resulting in:\n  * the under-reporting of interpersonal crimes (especially incest, child sexual abuse, domestic violence). \n  * In 2013 in the US, 70% of undocumented immigrants said they were \u201cless likely\u201d to report crimes of where they were harmed because they fear deportation. This allows employers to commit **wage theft** without penalty. \n  * In instances of domestic violence, people cannot seek help and safety. One case drew national headlines in February 2017, when an undocumented transgender woman from Mexico went to a courthouse in El Paso County, Tex., to file a protective order against her ex-boyfriend. She was detained on the spot by federal agents. \n  * Police brutality and the targeting of communities of color\n\n &gt; \u201cWomen of all races and ethnicities who have endured domestic violence have to make the choice at some point to stay or leave their abusers. For Black women, the first response is often to not report, not tell anyone. We want to protect our men. It\u2019s not easy to turn them over to the police, the courts and other institutions that have been historically racist and brutal to them...Black women have very real reasons why they\u2019re afraid of calling. They call the police and then they\u2019re abused themselves.\u201d \n\n &gt;&gt;*- Zo\u00eb Flowers, a BLM activist who has spent 17 years in the field of domestic violence*\n\n  \n* when reported, there are failures to make charges (lack of evidence in assault cases, DA \u2018drops the case\u2019, People say: \u2018do you really want to ruin *his\/her\/their* [the person causing harm's] life?'), and failures to make convictions if it does go to trial (\u2019hearsay\u2019, \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d, classism in ability to get lawyers\/knowledge of legal system) \n* survivors may not be provided with resources to heal (in some states survivors are required to pay their own rape kits).\n\n#####*How does the punitive system affect communities?*\n\n* Disempowers communities and forces a reliance on the state\n* Promotes survivor-blaming and divides communities\n* Causes the targeting of minorities by police\/state\n* Media fear mongering\n* Community doesn\u2019t become any safer \n  * creates the illusion that some crimes don\u2019t exist because too few cases (like sexual assault) while creating the illusion that some crimes are more problematic than they actually are (like drug possession) \n  * because the blame is on an individual instead of systemic problems, harm is likely to be committed again not just by the same person but others who are exposed to the same conditions\n\n#####*How does the punitive system affect those who cause harm?*\n* Pathologizes them\n* Punishment and incarceration do not rehabilitate, in some cases problematic behaviors worsen after prison\n* Follows person their whole life (i.e., sex offender registration)\n* isolates them\n* there is NO accountability\n* mass incarceration especially of marginalized peoples who\u2019s physical and psychological well being are not prioritized \n* forced prison labor and prison slavery in private and public prisons including ICE detention centers\n* may take away right to vote\n* difficulty finding work due to criminal record\n* difficulty finding a home to rent due to criminal record\n\n#####*How does the punitive system affect law enforcement and people who work in the justice system?*\n\n* They are taught to dehumanize people (i.e., \"perps\") and to racially profile leading to the brutal treatment and murder of people even suspected of a 'crime' especially people of color\n* They reduce in empathy; \"emotional burnout\"\n* They start seeing people as profiles and cases and lose touch with humanity\n* Trained to see the world in black &amp; white (literally and figuratively) instead of in the contextual, situational, and systemic factors in which behaviors occur\n* Indoctrinates them into a culture of white supremacy and patriarchy, instills values of 'dominance' instead of 'justice'\n\n^Note: Law enforcement are oppressors upholding this system, therefore, they are not the focus. This section is included for completeness and to highlight how even a working class person can become an oppressor. \n\n---\n\n\n###**2 - Restorative Justice System**\n\n####The restorative justice system asks: *How can a person who created harm give back?*\n\nIn this system, the offended party is still the state (cops, courts) not the survivor or the community, but the survivor and\/or community *may* have a limited opportunity to participate in the justice process. Punishments may still be pre-determined (e.g, mediation, classes, community service, reparations to those harmed) but are usually provided as an \"alternative\" to incarceration.\n\n#####*How does restorative justice affect people who were harmed?*\n\n* Gives survivors more opportunities to participate in process (to a limited level). \n\n* Incorporates survivors without basing approach on their voice\/perspective.\n\n#####*How does restorative justice affect the community?*\n\n* People are less likely to be removed from the community.\n* \u201cJustice\u201d is restored - but justice is defined by the state.\n*  In some ways it breaks judicial systems monopoly on responses, in some ways it extends the state further.\n* Acts as community-based but is not.\n\n#####*How does the restorative system affect those who cause harm?*\n\n* Holds individuals (not systems) responsible, does not take into account systems of oppression.\n* May provide an opportunity to avoid a record and other long-term consequences of incarceration\n* May allow them to remain with their families and community\n* \"second chance\" mentality\n* Does not change the material conditions which supported their harmful behavior\n* NO true accountability\n\n#####*How does the restorative justice system affect law enforcement and people who work in the justice system?*\n\n* For people like public defenders, it may allow them to act in sensitive cases like domestic abuse in communities of undocumented people without increasing state-based harm, it may give them an opportunity to promote alternatives to incarceration for the people they defend\n* In some ways it may provide the illusion that they are \"helping\" when they are just enforcing the state in new ways \n\n---\n\n\n###**3 - Transformative Justice**\n\n####Transformative Justice asks: *Why was the harm was committed and what are the root causes? What does justice and healing look like for the person(s) harmed and community?*\n\n&gt; \u201cTransformative Justice is a liberatory approach to justice that seeks safety and accountability without relying on alienation, punishment, or State or systemic violence, including incarceration and policing. Transformative Justice seeks to provide people who experience violence with immediate safety and long-term healing and reparations while holding people who commit violence accountable within and by their communities.\u201d -Generation Five, \u201cToward Transformative Justice\u201d, 2007\n\n#####*The 3 Core Beliefs of Transformative Justice by Generation 5:*\n1. Individual justice and collective liberation are equally important, mutually supportive, and fundamentally intertwined\u2014the achievement of one is impossible without the achievement of the other.\n2. The conditions that allow violence to occur must be transformed in order to achieve justice in individual instances of violence. Therefore, Transformative Justice is both a liberating politic and an approach for securing justice.\n3. State and systemic responses to violence, including the criminal legal system and child welfare agencies, not only fail to advance individual and collective justice but also condone and perpetuate cycles of violence.\n\nSource: \u201cTowards Transformative Justice\u201d by Generation 5  p. 5 Section One\n\n#####*How does Transformative Justice affect people who have been harmed?* \n\n* Centers the survivor\n* Asks what do you need to have justice\n* The person causing harm is not the priority -  the people they violated and the ending of violence are the priority. Important: Prioritizing the person causing harm is to enable and sustain abuse culture.\n* Can facilitate resources like mental and physical health care, fundraising, social support\n* Tries to secure safety and healing.\n\n#####*How does Transformative Justice affect communities?* \n\n* Involves a willingness to deeply question the status quo, and asks for imagination beyond current system.\n* Assumes each process is organic and particular to each situation\/community.\n* What does that community need to make this process accountable?\n* Works to address power and privilege, in community and larger systems.\n\n#####*How does Transformative Justice affect people who have caused harm?* \n\n* Calls for the accountability and transformation of those who cause abuse or harm. This requires a community response and community accountability.\n* Looks at the behavior \u2192 doesn\u2019t mean the person is a bad person. the person who caused harm has healing to do \n* Person is not reduced to their actions\n* Believes that someone can be both someone who has caused harm and has been harmed.\n* Offers choices and many options and moves toward liberatory values, understanding status quo is not enough.\n\n*What TJ is* ***NOT****:*\n\n* TJ is NOT about making excuses or apologies for harmful behavior. \n* TJ is NOT an avoidance of accountability, but rather, a more complete process of true accountability. \n\n\n#####*How does transformative justice affect law enforcement and people who work in the justice system?*\n\n * TJ removes all police, law enforcement, and the traditional judicial system and replaces them with the community (in the form of 'support teams' *more on this next post*) and with healing and rehabilitative resources \n\n#####*Transformative justice is hard to enact within our current world.*\n* People burn out. It brings up questions of capacity, as individuals and as communities.\n* It requires skills we don\u2019t learn \u201cculturally\u201d and within current institutions (open communities, conflict resolution, etc.)\n* Mistakes can have a real and huge impact on people\u2019s lives.\n\n---\n\n\n&gt; \"I don't know what a world without prisons will look like, but it will fundamentally transform our relationship with other people.\" \n&gt;&gt; -Mariame Kaba, a prison abolitionist &amp; advocate for transformative justice.\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n#####Next post:\n\n*What does Transformative Justice look like in practice? How can we apply it in our organizations, our communities, and the world at large?*\n\n---\n\n\n\n###**Resources**\n\nhttp:\/\/aorta.coop\/portfolio_page\/destabilizing-rape-culture-through-transformative-justice\/\n\nhttp:\/\/www.generationfive.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/07\/G5_Toward_Transformative_Justice-Document.pdf\n\nhttps:\/\/medium.com\/@AfroResistencia\/what-is-abuse-culture-aecc4a4e1c1d\n\nhttps:\/\/femmeleft.com\/transformative-justice.html\n\nhttp:\/\/criticalresistance.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/05\/Revolution-starts-at-home-zine.pdf\n\nhttp:\/\/savethekidsgroup.org\/transformative-justice-journal\/\n\nhttp:\/\/stonewallyouth.org\/transformative-justice-workshop-with-shira-hassan\/\n\nhttps:\/\/counselorchronicles.com\/what-i-think-transformative-justice-looks-like-d8f9de9dea0a","subreddit":"socialism","title":"On prison abolition and Transformative Justice""num_comments":0,"score":6,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"On prison abolition and Transformative Justice"}

My father is a New Testament professor, so I've had a lot of time to chat and exchange ideas on how we as leftists can not only spread anti-capitalistic ideals, but also embody love, kindness and affirmation to people of all backgrounds (fascists are excluded from this list). \n\nI feel like it would be super beneficial to collect a body of texts that embody leftist ideas on the human experience from not only the Christian Bible, but also from other religious texts across cultures. It would not only help us to reinforce our ideas and to grow as individuals, but it would expand our horizons in terms of sharing ideas with others from more backgrounds. \n\nI know that institutional religion (i.e. the Catholic Church, etc.) does include many unjustified hierarchies and such, but on an individual basis scripture can be very beneficial towards growth as an individual and as a community.\n\nTl;Dr: we should try collecting religious texts that intertwine with our ideas on community and anti-capitalism and share them with more people.\n\n\nThanks for reading, everyone.

Ever hear the phrase 'all power corrupts'? It's not a meme; it's the entire reason anarchy exists as a practice. \n\nLegitimizing authority enables archy. Doesn't matter if you call yourself an anarchist while justifying hierarchies you personally approve of for whatever reason. [NO authority](https:\/\/raddle.me\/f\/Anarchism\/40335\/the-idea-of-some-justified-hierarchy-is-completely-counter) is legitimate in the eyes of anarchy. [Yes, even in a parent-child relationship.](https:\/\/raddle.me\/f\/Anarchism\/40394\/on-anarchist-parenting-and-why-it-needn-t-be-a-hierarchy) \n\nWhen you legitimize an authority, you're granting it power, presenting it as an institution that needs to be obeyed at all costs, and it won't stop there. It'll want more power because that's the nature of power. Always grows, never stops to examine its devastating effect on its surroundings. Power is a license to do harm. Whether it was your original intention to enable a violent force of power when you legitimized an authority is irrelevant. It will do harm and the people who signed off on legitimizing it are culpable for that harm.\n\n[Anarchy is the opposition to authority](https:\/\/raddle.me\/f\/AskRaddle\/41151\/comment\/60087). To pretend otherwise would be a blatant misrepresentation of what anarchy is.\n\nA lot of people confuse expertise for authority and then use that confusion to insist anarchy doesn't oppose *all* authority. \n\nA carpenter might be good at what they do, an expert even, but that doesn't make them an authority.\n\n&gt;Authority is not simply an isolated instance of the use of force, but an ongoing social relationship between two parties. It is a relationship where one party has the socially legitimized right to command, and the other party has the corresponding obligation to obey.\n\n&gt;Consider a simple example: a wild beast attacks me and I kill it in self-defense. This is an instance of the use of force, it is not an instance of authority. Consider another example: I notice that my friend is in the path of a speeding car and pull them away. Again, force - not authority. Anarchy takes no stance against force, just authority.\n\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"No, anarchists don't believe in 'justified' hierarchies.

Two girls and a boy were injured in the   clashes.\n\nIn the sky there were fireworks,  triggered by comrades who  guarded another side of the pier, some in  the water, others on the  ground.\n\nBy sea,  in eight, four women and four men, we jumped into the  water, we  challenged the ban on approaching the ship, we wanted to cry  out that  we abhor the borders and those who control them, that we are  for the  freedom to move and shift, for everyone. Overboard the police  have  pursued us relentlessly, letting us breathe the exhausted gases of   their hulls, closing us when they could. Upon us a huge crescent moon,   red and almost full, against the background of the dark sky, has become a   symbol of a rebellious humanity, while we reached the ship. We had to   stop a few meters away because the engine of the boat was on to prevent   us from approaching. The migrants on the pier saw us, one of them  tried  to reach as at sea, but was blocked by a soldier who shouted,  \u201cShut  up!\u201d.\n\nWith pulsating hearts and  loud noises for our comrades on board  and for us in revolt we  articulated, \u201cFreedom, hurriya, libert\u00e0! No  border, no nation, stop  deportation\u201d. Against the criminal agreements of  Italy with the  powerful people of the planet, with Libya and not just  those; against  borders and those who control them; against the  militarization of the  Mediterranean Sea, lagers and prisons overland and  overboard for  migrants and indigent natives: against the design of a  world that  subordinates the importance of humanity to that of  commodities.\n\nWe  returned independently to swim, finding a garrison on  earth that sang  these same slogans, experiencing the sense of unity and  deep love that  is felt only when fighting together.\n\nAll  the pressure  exerted allowed the liberation of the migrants on board.  We faced the  defenders of the state, the members of the government. We  won a small  battle but continued our struggle.\n\nThe  migrants, in 137, are now in the  hotspot of Messina, at the Bisconte  barrack, waiting to be sorted,  partly in Ireland, partly in Albania,  where they want to inaugurate the  new European mega hotspot. They are  not the first nor the last ones.\n\nLet's go  forward together, knowing that there is no reception without   opposition to the war and to the always unjust dynamics of capital.\n\nLibert\u00e0,  Libertad, Libert\u00e9,  Freiheit, Hazadi, Hurrya, Freedom.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\-ANFIBI antirazziste\n\n\u200b\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/z4ojb824hpi11.jpg\n\n\u200b\n\nphoto by:\n\n[https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/USB-Immigrati-1622532654507603\/](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/USB-Immigrati-1622532654507603\/)\n\n\u200b\n\nlink video:\n\n[https:\/\/www.localteam.it\/video\/tensione-al-porto-di-catania-polizia-schierata](https:\/\/www.localteam.it\/video\/tensione-al-porto-di-catania-polizia-schierata)\n\n[https:\/\/www.localteam.it\/video\/a-pochi-metri-dalla-diciotti-manifestanti-in-acqua](https:\/\/www.localteam.it\/video\/a-pochi-metri-dalla-diciotti-manifestanti-in-acqua)","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Solidarity demonstration for migrants on Diciotti"}

A robust description of the organizers for the Blue Lives March and their connections to and affinity with white supremacy, transphobia and anti-immigrant politics can be found here. A pretty decent description of how the events unfolded can be found here.\n\nBelow are some (very incomplete and rushed) thoughts that feel relevant from one participant:\n\nAfter the police violence we dealt with, several report backs and press releases framed the events as a situation where police needlessly escalated an otherwise non-violent and non-confrontational situation. While it is accurate that our team was unable to effectively attack either the fascist march or the police, and didn\u2019t really have the opportunity to try at any point, it is decidedly inaccurate to assert that we did not have confrontational intentions. We should not play into narratives of innocence set up by our enemies when faced with State violence that we know is coming. We are in a violent political conflict with both the State and proto-paramilitary formations nationally and ought to recognize this and talk about it as it is.\nIn this vein, when we do successfully mobilize a confrontational action, we should hype that whether it goes well or not. That is the capacity we want to be building, and the 25th was another step in the right direction. Further, narratives about us being pure victims of unprovoked police violence erase the courage of those who took risks, arrests and blows in order to defend others from the cops. We had each others\u2019 backs that day, and while it didn\u2019t work out, that still means something. Let\u2019s lift that up to encourage and normalize practices of immediate defense, de-arrests, and risk-taking.\n\nKeep moving! We really need to work on both mobility and blockading. At one point, the bloc came out of an alley filled with dumpsters, saw a contingent of bike cops moving toward us, and allowed them to come up and form a line. Rather than use nearby obstacles to create space between us and the cops, we ended up in a futile standoff, dragged on longer than necessary largely by indecision.\n\nUse what is around! At the spot where the initial arrests took place, a very large number of police barricades (left over from the most recent Occupy ICE\/Homeless Against Stop and Frisk eviction) were ten feet from us. Using those to create space (as west Arch was undefended) rather than try an uncoordinated dart through bike cop lines could have been fruitful. And again, there are rolling dumpsters literally everywhere in center city.\n\nBe ready to take advantage of opportunity! Early on, before a significant police presence had formed, we darted past the Criminal Justice Center. Aside from a couple bottles being tossed at the windows, nothing happened to the building. This would have been an especially good target considering the nature of the fascist march that day, and done well to emphasize solidarity with the prison strike. The same could be said for at least a couple empty and undefended police vehicles that we passed before the initial confrontation.\n\nA lesson to really internalize here is that the police may escalate at any time. If, say, the above opportunities were seized, or our team escalated in any other ways, it\u2019s likely that repression faced afterwards would be blamed on those actions. It\u2019s important to keep in mind in the future, when we do go harder and actually crime it up better, that such actions are not to blame for repression. We\u2019ve seen repeatedly that toning down our actions does not keep us safe.\n\nAnd finally, the composition of the march appeared to me to be informed to some extent by its framing as primarily an \u201canti-fascist\u201d event. Without going too much into the potential pitfalls of prioritizing a sort of narrow antifascism over emphasis on broader structures of domination (here is a very good starting point for that), it seems plausible that placing more focus on the anti-police nature of our mobilization may have drawn more people and projects in the city into this action.\n\nTo be clear, these thoughts are all offered in extreme good faith, and I\u2019d like to repeat that my main takeaway from the 25th is that we really had each other\u2019s backs and did our best. Let\u2019s do that more!\n\nLet\u2019s continue to care for one another in dealing with our physical and emotional wounds.\n\nLet\u2019s come back harder soon.\n\nfire to the prisons &amp; the cops,\n\ndeath to fascism &amp; white supremacy, and let\u2019s be real, fuck democracy too,\n\n\u2013 some anarchist living on occupied Lenape land\n\nFROM It's Going Down (a website blacklisted by Reddit)","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Reflections from Philly March Against \u2018Blue Lives Matter\u2019"}

By extension, if you lived in a capitalistic society, you could voluntarily leave and join a socialistic society.\n\nI don\u2019t believe the same hold true the other way around. If an-soc\/an-com ideals come to fruition, what happens to someone like me in that society?","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"A quick question"}

And even if you haven't read the book yet I'm still interested in your opinion on the particular point discussed below.\n\nIn particular, the section I'm talking about is from the end of chapter 5. Graeber is discussing the impact of the growth and predomination of the financial sector over the rest of the economy, in relation to his discussion on the economic and social forces responsible for the rise of bullshit jobs. \n\nHe then says: \n\n&gt;The results were not just some sort of recalibration or readjustment of existing forms of capitalism. In many ways, it marked a profound break with what had come before. If the existence of bullshit jobs seems to defy the logic of capitalism, one possible reason for their proliferation might be that the existing system isn\u2019t capitalism\u2014or at least, isn\u2019t any sort of capitalism that would be recognizable from the works of Adam Smith, Karl Marx, or, for that matter, Ludwig von Mises or Milton Friedman. It is increasingly a system of rent extraction where the internal logic\u2014the system\u2019s \u201claws of motion,\u201d as the Marxists like to say\u2014are profoundly different from capitalism, since economic and political imperatives have come to largely merge. In many ways, it resembles classic medieval feudalism, displaying the same tendency to create endless hierarchies of lords, vassals, and retainers.\n\nSo what do yall make of this musing, that perhaps the economic system is not any longer even capitalism? I know many of you are more well versed in economic theory than myself, and probably even more so than Graeber, so I'd love to see some of yall respond to his thought here. \n\nOf particular interest to me is the practical application of the analysis. If we're not living in capitalism any more, does that potentially open up different allies? Does it make it such that we should rethink our analysis and approach to resisting the current state of affairs? \n\nPerhaps our language needs to change to better reflect the actual current reality -- for instance, in a world where so many have bullshit jobs, it isn't any wonder that the strength by which people identify as a worker has subsided. And yet the old rhetoric and constructs based on that worker identity is still one of the central part of anarchist analysis and engagement.

But I recently started looking into other forms of anarchism. As a capitalist, I am aware of the liberalisation of economies (specifically China and India) resulting in the lowering of people that live in poverty by the billions.

So, I suppose the question is, how could anarchism be better for the poor than capitalism?","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Answer for capitalism lowering poverty"}
