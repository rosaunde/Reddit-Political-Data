Naturally, the state being the largest harbinger of violence there is, I am opposed to its existence, like many Anarchists. \n\nWhat I believe is also in keeping with what are commonly termed \"anarcho\\-capitalists\". \n\nI would like to address what I see as an unnecessary hostility between the left and right anarchist movements, which seems to me illogical. I believe that Anarchists and Anarcho\\-Capitalists should be mutually aiding each other in achieving the downfall of the great oppressor, the state. Note that when I speak of Anarcho\\-Capitalism, I speak of those who actually take principled opposition to the state, and not of those who use Anarcho\\-Capitalist as a pseudonym for that awful ideology, the alt\\-right. \n\nI have called myself an anarcho\\-capitalist, only for lack of a better word. I am not inherently opposed to capitalism in an ethical sense, or ethically in favour of capitalism. All I am in favour of is a world in which each person can choose the way in which they live without force being wantonly put upon them. If that manifests in a communities of capitalists, mutualists, syndicalists, and\/or collectivists, so be it.\n\nI feel that this view is shared by many Anarcho\\-Capitalists, and I hope by as many Anarchists. I think both ideologies share common ground in trying to maximise freedom of the individual, and both ideologies wish to see the elimination of our common enemy, the state. \n\nIt is for this reason that I appeal, perhaps in vain, for an end in hostility between these camps. I do not see why our small differences need to result in the vile rhetoric used by both sides.\n\n\\- An enemy of the state. ","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"An Appeal to Reason"}

Furthermore, I find it absolutely undeniable that Environmental Collapse is the most important issue confronting our species and the world at present, and yet these ideologies offer absolutely no solution with something even close to proven success, and because of these failures, I had to abandon them. \n\n Therefore, I'm going to present a series of questions that I feel are not presently answered or even addressed by the traditional, leftist, 19th century forms of anarchism. First, I will present a few facts \\(with citation\\) in order to avoid what I characterize as the \"typical, unfounded, shortcuts to thinking\" that I'm usually given as answers to these questions. Furthermore, I want to emphatically **stipulate** that, with respect to the responses\\*\\*, nothing will be considered a fact or truthful without explicit and specific source ci**tation. Modern humans, especially in America, have an unfounded belief that opinions matter, and even more ludicrous, that everyone's opinion matters and is just as valuable as everyone elses. This cannot be further from reality. I'm not interested in opinions, unless they're based on a adequately large dataset of empirical evidence and espoused by highly learned individuals that may be considered \"experts\" in their field. Furthermore, abstain from using the following term, in any respect, \"human nature\" as this only results in unfounded assumptions aimed solely at silencing deb**ate. Oh yeah, please refrain from irrelavant ad hominem attacks that in reality do absolutely nothing to refute the message and information contained herein. Pointing out that I'm using a computer to do this, even if it is hypocritical, does absolutely nothing to refute these arguments, Furthermore, it seems obvious to me that anyone resorting to the desperate act of acting the messenger does so only because they're incapable of attacking and refuting the message. So, I can't prevent anyone from doing so, but if you do, just know that you're implicitly admitting defeat and waving the white flag by resorting to such transgression\\*\\*s.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nHere\u2019s the magic number: 50 billion tons. That\u2019s how much of the Earth\u2019s materials and life forms we can safely use each year. That includes everything from wood to plastic, fish to livestock, minerals to metals: all the physical stuff that we consume. Right now, we\u2019re using about 80 billion tons each year\u2013way over the limit. So for growth to be green, we need to somehow get back down to 50 billion tons despite expanding the GDP.\n\nWhen green growth theory was first proposed, there was no evidence on whether it would actually work\u2013it was purely speculative. But over the past few years, three major studies have set out to examine this question. All have arrived at the same rather troubling conclusion: Even under best\\-case scenario conditions, absolute decoupling of GDP growth from material use is not possible on a global scale.\n\nIt was a team of scientists led by Monika Dittrich that first pointed this out. They ran a model showing that under business\\-as\\-usual conditions, growth will drive global resource use to a staggering 180 billion tons per year by 2050. At more than three times the safe limit, that means game over for human civilization as we know it.\n\nThen the team ran the model with the optimistic assumption that every nation on Earth immediately adopts best practice in efficiency, with all the best available technology. The results were a bit better: We would end up hitting 93 billion tons per year by 2050. But that\u2019s not absolute decoupling, and it\u2019s a far cry from anything approaching green growth.\n\nA second team of scientists tested the same question again in 2016, and found that even aggressive measures like a carbon price as high as $250 per ton and a doubling of technological efficiency don\u2019t do the trick. If we keep growing the global economy by 3&amp;#37; each year, they found, we\u2019ll still hit about 95 billion tons by 2050. No absolute decoupling. No green growth.\n\nFinally, last year the United Nations itself weighed in on the debate, hoping to settle the matter once and for all. It modelled a carbon price rising to a whopping $573 per ton, added a material extraction tax, and assumed rapid tech innovation spurred by strong government policy. The results? We hit 132 billion tons by 2050\u2013even worse than the two previous studies found. Worse because this time the scientists included the \u201crebound effect\u201din their model. As gains in efficiency reduce the cost of commodities, demand for those commodities goes up, cancelling out some of the reductions in material use.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget: All three of these models use radically optimistic assumptions. We\u2019re a long way from even testing a global carbon tax, much less a tax of $573 per ton; and we\u2019re not on track to double our efficiency. In fact, quite the opposite: Right now our efficiency is getting worse, not better.\n\nWhy the bad news? The main reason is that tech innovation just doesn\u2019t work the way most of us assume. We know that Moore\u2019s law says that chip performance doubles about every two years\u2013but this doesn\u2019t apply to material use. There are physical limits to material efficiency, and once we start to reach them then the scale effect of growth drives material use back up in the long run. For instance you might be able to produce a wooden table more efficiently, but you can\u2019t produce a table out of nothing. In the end you\u2019ll need a minimum amount of wood, and once you reach that limit, then any growth in table production is going to come along with a corresponding growth in wood use.\n\nSources: [https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/40548564\/better\\-technology\\-isnt\\-the\\-solution\\-to\\-ecological\\-collapse](https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/40548564\/better-technology-isnt-the-solution-to-ecological-collapse)\n\n[https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/40527804\/no\\-country\\-on\\-earth\\-is\\-sustainably\\-meeting\\-its\\-basic\\-needs](https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/40527804\/no-country-on-earth-is-sustainably-meeting-its-basic-needs)\n\n[https:\/\/www.boell.de\/en\/ecology\/publications\\-green\\-economies\\-around\\-the\\-world\\-15194.html](https:\/\/www.boell.de\/en\/ecology\/publications-green-economies-around-the-world-15194.html)\n\n[http:\/\/eprints.whiterose.ac.uk\/92268\/13\/Owen&amp;#37;20Journal&amp;#37;20of&amp;#37;20Cleaner&amp;#37;20Production&amp;#37;202015&amp;#37;20AAM.pdf](http:\/\/eprints.whiterose.ac.uk\/92268\/13\/Owen%20Journal%20of%20Cleaner%20Production%202015%20AAM.pdf)\n\n[http:\/\/www.resourcepanel.org\/reports\/assessing\\-global\\-resource\\-use](http:\/\/www.resourcepanel.org\/reports\/assessing-global-resource-use)\n\n**QUESTIONS**\n\n1. The vast majority of ideologies that are associated with the \u201cleft\u201d is that whether explicitly or implicitly, they make the promise that they\u2019ll offer everything that capitalism does and then \"more\". I think most of us can loosely agree on the fact that with respect to raw material and resource extraction, what is occurring at present is most likely the \u201cmost efficient\u201d \\(maximum yield with minimal input energy\\) that can be achieved with current technology. Based on that, **how does any leftist ideology propose to deliver \u201cmore\u201d than what capitalism is currently? Seeing as the environment cannot be pushed any further without imminent collapse, how could this be accomplished using the technology we presently possess in order to deliver the \"more\" that the left promises?**\n2. If we assume that at present, an anarchist form of organization \\(based on traditional\/leftist\/workerist anarchism\\) has replaced capitalism, **how would this mass anarchist society interact with hypothetical anarcho\\-primitivist bands or indigenous hunter\\-gatherers that currently exist today? If resources absolutely necessary to the industrialized, anarchist mass society were located on the land inhabited by anarcho\\-primititivists and hunter\\-gatherers, how would the industrialized anarchist society proceed\/resolve the situation \\(do not refer to technologies that do not currently exist\\)?**\n3. Pollution and environmental degradation are an absolute reality of industrialized society. Based on the observable fact that pollution spreads to areas never intended and results in consequences that are unforeseeable in the present, **how would an industrialized anarchist society ensure that its industrial operations and processes do not result in consequences for populations outside of that society around the globe? How could they ensure such seemingly uncontrollable phenomenon like acid rain would only affect themselves and thereby not be forced upon any unwilling populations?**\n4. In human history, every civilization ever created has collapsed, with environmental degradation being a part of every instance of collapse, if not the cause, without referring to ambiguous, theoretical technologies that currently do not exist, **how would an industrialized anarchist society avoid the brazen hubris that has ignored this historical pattern and address the rapidly approaching environmental catastrophe?**\n5. In all industrialized societies\/economies, there are certain duties and jobs that the vast majority would never prefer or volunteer for, and while these jobs and their undesirable nature are subjective to the individual, how would an industrialized, anarchist society ensure that these jobs are filled\/completed without resorting to coercion? **In other words, without the capitalist threat of loss of income and jeopardized survival, homelessness, social stigma, etc how would you convince workers to slaughter animals, operate destructive strip mines or descend over a mile into a mine shaft, or mind numbingly produce widgets on an assembly line and how would this be reconciled with the desire for absolute freedom and autonomy?**\n6. I would argue that when human relations\/interactions have a component of necessity, they are ultimately disengenuous and subjagating to those invovled, for example, if you need something necessary for survival from someone which you cannot obtain otherwise, you're incentive is to manipulate the person or situation to ensure you obtain whatever is required \\-or\\- you may prevent yourself from acting toward them with absolute honesty if it could jeopardize your access to that which they possess. Most of us \\(at least in America\\) require a vehicle in order to work, and therefore live, though because we usually only specialize in one skill at work, we cannot realistically acquire all the other skills necessary to survive in a self\\-autonomous fashion, thus most of us cannot maintain our own automobile so we're dependent on technicians, If for example, the technician was ripping you off, but they're the only one in your area that can work on your vehicle, are you likely to confront and prevent them from exploiting you? **how can the complete lack of autonomy and self\\-sufficiency that the dependency on advanced technological systems produces in the individual be reconciled with anarchism\u2019s stated objective of freedom? How can an individual be truly free or autonomous if their reality effectively prevents them from acquiring the various skills and resources necessary to ensure their survival without being dependent on others? Is it accurate to considering yourself a free member of society if the choice to exit or abandon that society effectively abolishes any assurance or probability of survival?**\n7. While oversimplified, the expressed goal of traditional anarchism is direct democratic control over the means of production \\(economy\\) through workers\u2019 councils and other organizations, however, the overwhelming totality of all industrial and economic decisions are currently arrived at based on mathematics\/scientific calculations. For example, can there be any democratic debate on the most efficient means of achieving nuclear fission? Or which metals have the best thermal conductivity? **Our modern techno\\-industrial world and its machinations are largely controlled by technicians and engineers guided by the absolute logic of math and science and the laws of our physical world, where and how could democratic decision making enter into this process in an influential and meaningful way that would actually result in these industrial processes being carried out by means not identical to the environmentally destructive and unsustainable ones at present? Also, can worker self\\-management truly be considered revolutionary when at its base, it only characterized a change in management of the industrial process? While, for example, a worker\u2019s committee could decide to administer an industrial process in a way differing from the mathematically most efficient, can this honestly be justified considering the absolute and finite limits on raw materials? And, if the implicit goal is to continue the functioning of the techno\\-industrial order, wouldn\u2019t self\\-management opposed to maximum efficiency be a self\\-destructive undertaking?**\n8. The dependence of civilization on agriculture, and the pattern of every previous civilization resulting in collapse suggest that agriculture, whether absent advanced technology or with it, is inherently unsustainable. In the book *Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations* by David Montgomery, he defines soil as an nonrenewable resource and points to a human history dominated by this reality. For example, the soils of the Mediterranean basin were largely destroyed by 2,000 years ago, and they remain wrecked today. They are quite likely to remain wrecked for many, many thousands of years. Or how from soil layers dating back to **before** the Spanish incursion into the Americas, it has been demonstrated that the Aztecs had destroyed the productive capacity of the soil. I'm sure we're all familiar with farming beginning in the Fertile Crescent which is now a desert, a feat accomplished less than 1000 years after farming began. Ever wonder why the Lebanese flag has cedar trees? BEcause there once existed thick cedar forests in the area that civilized humans quickly eradicated, and later accounted for this outcome with the folk memory of the forest they had once called reality. The epic Sumerian tale of Gilgamesh describes vast tracts of cedar forests in what is now southern Iraq. According to the story, Gilgamesh defies the gods by cutting down the forest, and in return the gods say they will curse the land with fire and drought. In fact, the Sumerians likely deforested the land, causing widespread desertification. By 2100 B.C., soil erosion and salt buildup had devastated agriculture, forcing residents to move north to Babylonia and Assyeria. Further evidence for this theory?\u00a0Some of the first laws ever written to protect forests were decreed in the Sumerian settlement of Ur. In the present, the application of every technology at our disposal has only exponentially increased this phenomenon to the point of the soil being completely devoid of nutrients and instead acting as nothing more than a dirt sponge for the application of petrochemicals that have assumed responsibility for the functions once served by natural soil. **Based on these facts, it seems conclusive that agriculture is inherently sustainable whether it has no technology or the most advanced technology at its disposal so how does the anarchist left propose the continuation of the agriculture its civilization and techno\\-industrial order cannot exist without?**","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Questions for Traditional\/Leftist\/19th Century\/Workerist Anarchists - From an Anarcho-Primitivist"}

Let's focus on small scale communist experiments, and let's see whether they work or not.\n\nTheir constant premise is to deny that large scale experiments were communism, and point toward \"succesful\" small scale communist experiments, and then use [inductive reasoning](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Inductive_reasoning) to say that if it works in small scale, then we just need to figure out ways to scale it up, and then bang we will have a global communist utopia.\n\nThe only problems is that what if I could demonstrate beyond the reasonable doubt, that communism fails even in the small scale, then we could disprove communism entirely once and for all.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n---------------------\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe could analyze any small scale communist experiment, but the most factual one in my opinion was the [Kibbutz](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kibbutz) system in Israel that tried to setup utopian communist establishments, small communes basically, in order to achieve utopia.\n\nGuess what it totally failed, so much that they had to privatize everything and eliminate almost all egalitarian elements from it due to inhabitants being unhappy.\n\nNow this was well documented, so there isn't even a shred of doubt about the factuality of any this. Not like with the Spanish Revolution for instance where there was a lot of propaganda involved so we don't know clearly what happened.\n\nBut the Kibbutz phenomena was studied by tons of economists and sociologists around the world and we know exactly how things rolled out.\n\nRead the wikipedia article about their decline: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kibbutz#Decline_and_restructuring\n\nLet me review the events in a few points:\n\n* They were collective communities, \"communes\", setup since the early 1900's.\n* Traditionally they were based on farming, so they were mostly agricultural communes.\n* A lot of the settlers had socialist views so they were setup to be socialist from the beginning aimed to create a communist utopia in the area.\n* Local Arabs have started raiding the settlements frequently so most Kibbutzim have armed themselves and have become basically a self-sustainable settlement with their own defense, policing, and administration, all of it setup to be managed in an egalitarian way.\n* Local Arabs also started sabotaging the irrigation canals and started burning the crops so the Kibbutzim have formed their own military units to defend their area.\n* Jews around the world have \"crowdfunded\" money to support the Kibbutzim and many have started emigrating there to help out.\n* Early settlers had to work hard in the fields to grow enough crops to sustain themselves, but have shared everything in a very socialist way.\n* Kibbutzim grew and flourished between the 1930 and 1940, as many Jews who could escape from WW2 ended up here, by 1939 the total membership was over 24000 totalling 79 Kibbutzim.\n* They were the first establishments to have complete gender equality.\n* Up until the 1970 the egalitarian rules were very strict, people couldn't even own basic tools like kitchen appliances, all was to be shared, and since then the egalitarian aspect has been eroding more and more.\n* People dined together, worked together, and lived together, everything was done as a community.\n* To achieve women equality, kindengartens were setup to raise kids, so that women could work if they wanted to. Children didn't even lived with their parents, they all lived and slept in a separate house.\n* Kibbutznik were barely attracted to eachother, and they have preferred to marry people outside of their settlements, what is now known as the [Westermarck effect](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Westermarck_effect#Westermarck_effect).\n* There was a lot of group pressure towards conformity and nonconformists were ostracized and punished, thus crime rates were very low.\n* Even though they have all tried to achieve a self-reliant communities, they were heavily subsidized from the outside.\n\n* Most settlers were totally atheists and have rejected the Jewish religion, but only kept Jewish traditions and culture, where on holidays instead of holding religious rituals they have just danced and partied basically.\n* By the 1960 the living standards have increased faster in the Kibbutzim than in regular cities of Israel, where the Kibbutzim members had swimming pools and more luxorious lives than their counterparts (I guess this was due to the relative age of the Kibbutzim compared to  Jewish towns which were just recently built).\n* By the 1970 kibbutzniks had enjoyed full middle-class standards of lives while being working class members.\n* The decline started after 1970 where the living standards have stagnated due to the economy of agriculture being phased out and the economy of Israel becoming more diverse, a lot of kibbutzniks started moving out to get a career of their own.\n* By the 1980 the economy inside the Kibbutzim started to rapidly deteriorate leading to the [Kibbutz crisis](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kibbutz_crisis), where the debt levels of the Kibbutzim ran out of control, and they struck a negotiation with their creditors to delete some of their debts, but with conditions to restructure their economy as the current model was unsustainable.\n* After the fall of the Soviet Union socialist ideology weakened worldwide, while kibbutzniks were beginning to be exposed to \"wester\" life, each kibbutznik had a TV in their homes and started purchasing luxury goods, so the community aspect started eroding and people became more individualists.\n* Education and healthcare started to become privatized in the Kibbutzim in order to lure back professionals who had emigrated away.\n* Many kibbutznik preferred the urban lifestyle so futher emigration happened.\n* Differential wages became adopted, as wage equality no longer satisfied people, they have began paying people differently by the amount they worked.\n* Property associations became setup, which transfered the ownership of assets, like houses, from the Kibbutz into the associations, effectively privatizing homes and other land inside it.\n* The resistance to privatization while initially high, have begun to fade and people started welcoming more and more Capitalism.\n* Since the 1990s many Kibbutzim participated in the privatization and only a very few of them remained socialist, some of them were even disbanded and absorbed into the regional municipalities.\n* The new compensation models became 3 way parted: 1) one one hand equally compensated for all work, 2) mixed compensation relative to the labor they do, 3) individual income based solely on individual production, the 3rd method making up most of the income of the kibbutzniks\n* According to a  University of Haifa study 72% of the Kibbutzim began implementing individualistic rules.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---------------------------\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# So there you have it:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* It was as close as you can get to egalitarian communism, their entire way of life was extremely collectivist and everything was shared equally. \n* It was implemented peacefully, no revolution, or any other chaos, and it evolved as naturally as it could.\n* It was small scale communism\n* **And it totally failed.** There was no external intervention or subversion, it just eroded naturally and people naturally chose the individual capitalist lifestyle over the socialist\/communist lifestyle.\n\n\nIt's the best example that you have to prove that communism is totally unfeasible. This is the best example because almost all other communist experiments happened inside a war or a revolution so you could say that a lot of external forces could influence the community.\n\nLike the [Free Territory](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Free_Territory) was beseiged by the Soviets and the [CNT](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Confederaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_del_Trabajo) was crushed by Fascist forces.\n\nBut the Kibbutzim was virtually untouched, aside from the early Arab skirmishes, so you can't even make a case that \"evil capitalists\" have influenced them.\n\nIt's just simply the kibbutznik have rationally, consciously and naturally chose the individualistic lives over the collective life. \n\nAnd even happiness has improved, people were very unhappy initially in the collectivist system and felt very unsatisfied with their lives, but as the have started the privatization, they have became more satisfied. There were [many psychology studies](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kibbutz#Psychological_aspects) on this, look it up.\n\nIt can't be any more simple that this, it's the Maslow Pyramid: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\n\nOnly Capitalism can satisfy all the needs of a human being. Self-actualization can only happen in an Individualistic Capitalistic society where people can achieve their own goals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere you have it, **Communism utterly disproved once and for all**.\n\n\n","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"Smallscale Communism Also Totally Failed!""num_comments":15,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Smallscale Communism Also Totally Failed!"}

Six of the officers had firearms, both handguns and rifles, trained on Hall who was squatting in a defensive position with the small knife in his hand. At one point, the K9 handler backed up and Hall seemed to relax and took a step toward the police officers.\nAll six officers opened fire, discharging 46 rounds in a few seconds and killing Hall.\n(I describe the death of Milton Hall and three other homeless men murdered by police in my essay [\"When Police Kill the Homeless\"](http:\/\/americancynic.net\/log\/2014\/4\/16\/when_police_kill_the_homeless\/).)\n\nOne indicator of the depth of the cowardice, barbarity, and impunity with which police kill is the shear number of family pets shot by police in America every year. \nMost police shootings in most departments involve dogs, but nobody keeps track of how many are killed by police nation wide.\nThe [Puppycide Database Project](https:\/\/puppycidedb.com\/) has collected data on over 2,900 dogs shot by police so far.\nIn headline after headline the shootings are unprovoked, a function of police being armed, undisciplined, unaccountable, frightened, and predisposed to violence.\nA 2014 article titled [\"Can Police Stop Killing Dogs?\"](http:\/\/www.policemag.com\/channel\/patrol\/articles\/2014\/10\/can-police-stop-killing-dogs.aspx) in _POLICE_ magazine quotes a Department of Justice specialist, in what I hope is an overly high estimate, that as many as \"25 to 30 pet dogs are killed each day by law enforcement officers.\"\nThat's each _day_.\n\nBut one of the most infuriating behaviors of American police is the readiness with which so many officers arrive on a scene, heart pumping with fear, to quickly shoot an unarmed human suspect -- disproportionately so if the suspect is a racial minority.\nIn the case of [Tamir Rice](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shooting_of_Tamir_Rice), a 12-year-old black kid who was innocuously playing with an airsoft gun at a park near his home, \"quickly\" meant less than two seconds after officers drove up to him.\nBut in cases of _actual_ danger, when people need protection from armed perpetrators, cops decked out in tactical gear too often become suddenly preoccupied with their own safety.\n\nWhen I was a freshman in high school, a nearby school became the site a mass shooting.\nThe two perpetrators planted propane bombs in the cafeteria set to detonate during lunch -- when around 500 students would be in the room -- and then positioned themselves in their cars with semiautomatic weapons and shotguns to shoot fleeing survivors.\nWhen the bombs failed to explode, the two improvised and became pioneers of the modern shooting rampage.\nAccording to the [Columbine Review Commission report](https:\/\/schoolshooters.info\/sites\/default\/files\/Columbine%20-%20Governor's%20Commission%20Report.pdf) (all parenthetical page numbers refer to this document), \"six officers from the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office had arrived on the scene within minutes after the attack had begun\" in addition to four Denver police officers (including three SWAT team members). (38)\nAs the killing spree continued inside the school for about 40 minutes before the shooters committed suicide, the police outside the school -- with their superior and growing numbers, firepower, armor, radios, and training -- did almost nothing to intervene or put themselves in danger.\n\nAt one point early in the shooting, the Denver SWAT members on scene witnessed one of the shooters stick the barrel of his gun out a door and fire several rounds.\n\"Two of the Denver officers fired at the doorway, but it is not known why the Denver officers, who were fully equipped with high-powered weaponry and body armor, took no further action.\" (33, note 80)\n\nEven after receiving a description of the shooters, and while unarmed students and teachers did what they could to rescue each other, the armed police continued in their cowardice.\n\"It was reported that at least one student who had managed to escape from the school (and who had carried out a fellow student with him) told the police outside the school that there were only two gunmen and urged that the police go in after them to prevent further killing. But instead of entering the school, the police first began to set up a security perimeter around the school so that the gunmen could not escape.\" (60, note 152)\n\nThe worst of the carnage took place in the library about fifteen minutes into the shooting, where for almost _eight minutes_ dispatchers knew where the killers were and police continued to safely tend to their security perimeter outside.\n\"At that point, Patti Nielson dropped the telephone \u2014 leaving the line open \u2014 and sought refuge under a desk. Dispatchers could hear the ensuing carnage as the perpetrators in a seven-and-one-half minute killing spree taunted and executed nine more students, while sparing others.\" (30)\n\nIn fact, no attempt to enter the school was made by police until 12:06pm, about the same time the shooting ended.\nThat initial entry resulted in two staff members being escorted safely from the school.\nA second attempt by SWAT to enter the school, this time near the library where the perpetrators were already dead, did not go as smoothly.\nAs officers approached the door they were spooked by a reflection of themselves in a window, which they shot before retreating (in order to \"reassess the situation\"). (43, note 103)\n\nPolice did not enter again until an hour after the shooting had ended.\n\"Regrettably, wounded students remained in the library awaiting rescue during the period of time police had postponed entering the school\u2019s west side.\" (44)\nAs victims bled to death in the school, SWAT teams moved very slowly and cautiously through the hallways.\n\"The sheriff\u2019s report implied that the officers faced too many unknown hazards for them to move more quickly, but in an interview with a law enforcement trade journal, Williams later stated that the officers 'went in with superior weapons. We had HK MP5's (automatic sub-machine guns), assault rifles, gas guns, shotguns, as well as sidearms. We entered with Army helmets with Kevlar, ballistic tactical jackets with steel plates in the front and ballistic shields.' Despite such weaponry and armor, the record reflected that a burned carpet, spent and unlit ordnance, unfired bullets and broken glass had deterred officers from conducting a swifter search\". (53, note 132)\n\nIt took an hour and a half for police to reach the science room where students and teachers were performing first aid on victims -- whom the police commenced to rough up.\n\"Teacher Alan Cram characterized the SWAT officers as 'very abusive;' they would not listen to him as he tried to tell them\" the whereabouts of a wounded teacher. (53)\nIt took police over three hours after the shooting stopped to make it to the library where most of the victims were.\nIn the Columbine episode of the television series _Zero Hour_, Randy Brown, the father of one of the students who knew the shooters, described the scene outside the library as he understood it:\n\n&gt; One of the things the police don't want you to know about that day is that on April 20th, while the executions are taking place, while these innocent children are being murdered in the library, the outside library door is propped open. And the policemen that are standing by their cars on the lawn outside are listening to these children being murdered. And they listen, and they listen, and they never rescue them. And they let them be murdered.\n\nYet it took less than two seconds to shoot and mortally wound Tamir Rice for playing with a toy gun.\n\nI don't mean to imply that cowardice or violence should be at the root of a criticism of policing in general, but the inverse relationship that seems to hold between the degree to which police are armed and the heroics of their actions is a tragic phenomenon which goes along with the transparency of American police in fulfilling their class roles.\n\n----------\n\n(Original posted to my weblog as [\"SWAT Team Fife\"](https:\/\/americancynic.net\/log\/2018\/6\/7\/swat_team_fife\/))","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"SWAT Team Fife: On the inverse relationship that seems to hold between the degree to which police are armed and the heroics of their actions."}

I was curious if other anarchists know about her. I'll leave you with a few wikipedia quotes of her historical relevance to anarchism:\n\n\"In 1919, at 10 years of age, she declared herself a Bolshevik. In her late teens, she became involved in the workers' movement. She wrote political tracts, marched in demonstrations, and advocated workers' rights. At this time, she was a Marxist, pacifist, and trade unionist. While teaching in Le Puy, she became involved in local political activity, supporting the unemployed and striking workers despite criticism. Weil had never formally joined the Communist party, and in her twenties she became increasingly critical of Marxism. According to P\u00e9trement, she was one of the first to identify a new form of oppression not anticipated by Marx, where \u00e9lite bureaucrats could make life just as miserable for ordinary people as did the most exploitative capitalists... Weil arranged for Trotsky to stay at her parents' apartment in December 1933 while he was in Paris for secret meetings. She had argued against Trotsky both in print and in person, suggesting that \u00e9lite communist bureaucrats could be just as oppressive as the worst capitalists. Weil was one of the rare few who appeared to hold her own with the Red Army founder in a face-to-face debate... In 1936, despite her professed pacifism, she traveled to the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side, and joined the anarchist columns of Buenaventura Durruti. She even took a rifle, but was expelled from combat line by her comrades, as she was extremely short-sighted, and they feared Simone shooting one of them.\"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Thoughts on Simone Weil?"}

However I have seen from talking to conservative family members and such, much of the victimhood complex in which the reactionaries huddle under is based off of inflammatory \"anti-white\" rhetoric (All white people are racist, fuck white people etc.) pushed by many of us can be paving a justification for said victimhood complex and pushing working-class whites towards fascist orgs who use catchphrases like Anti-Racist is codeword for Anti-White, blah blah blah. \n\nCertainly we can't stop critiquing white supremacy, but with the \"anti-white\" stuff becoming more of a focus and a recruiting point for fascists, is it a good idea to use alienating language at whites who would otherwise agree with us, or should we start using another way with words?

And while I was there, I had an interesting experience that I thought I'd like to share in light of suicide being a hot topic the past few days.\n\nUpon arrivng at the jail, after the usual degrading things like being stripped naked and made to wear a jump suit with no undergarments they sat me down with a nurse.\n\nShe asked me a few questions, one of them was, \"Would you commit suicide?\" I flippantly said, \"I'd love to.\" I then went on to say, no that's just a joke, it's how I respond to situations like this.\n\nWell, apparently the police are totally devoid of any sense of humor, so here's what happened next:\n\nI was then subsequently stripped from my jump suit,and made to wear some padded vest, again with no undergarments. I was essentially totally naked.\n\nI was then put into a \"calming\" cell.\n\nThe floor was covered in piss and I was totally alone for about 5 hours.\n\nThere were no benches, no chairs, nothing to lay on except the piss covered floor. The only way to relieve yourself was into a literal hole that was cut out into the floor.\n\nSo there I was, naked, in jail, laying on a piss covered floor. The cell itself was something like out of a nightmare. I was incredibly frightened at that point.\n\nThey then came to check on me, took my blood pressure. I said this was all a mistake, I'm not suicidal, I was just joking.\n\nThey then went on to tell me that before I was released I would have to be evaluated by a psychiatrist. That psychiatrist *might* be in that week.\n\nLuckily a couple of hours later they came and shackled me and took me and like 20 something other people in front of the judge. At this point they put me back in a jump suit, which I was grateful for.\n\n As a side note, the majority were minorities caught with drugs and there was one immigrant there who was going to flat out be deported. \n\nAfter we got back there had been a shift change and managed to get myself into a holding cell with the other guys instead of going back into the \"calming\" cell.\n\nI thought I was going to be in there for days, but luckily the psychiatrist showed up and I was cleared for release. Got out around 5 in the afternoon with no money, a dead cell phone, and 15 miles away from home.\n\nI got a taste of what it's like to have psychiatric problems and end up in jail. They strip you naked, degrade you, lock you away in solitary, in a room where you have to shit and piss into a hole in the ground.\n\nIf you're diagnosed as possibly having suicidal tendencies or mental problems you immediately become totally subjected to the power of the state and the evaluation of a state employed psychiatrist.\n\nI can only wonder what it's like for those who are actually diagnosed. The nightmare became very real for me, but only for a few hours. It was easily the worst experience of my life. \n\nRight now there are those with depression, suicidal tendencies, psychiatric disorders who are being locked away in solitarty, being force fed medicine, trapped in concrete and steel, being pushed around by pigs, being shackled and stripped. Their pain is increased beyond anything they've ever experienced and I simply don't understand how anyone could get out of it, how they could ever overcome the experience.\n\nI know that it wasn't for weeks afterward that I started to feel normal again. I never felt so violated in all of my life.\n\nThis is the reality of the state. This is how the most vulnerable of us is treated in the hands of the prison system. It needs to end.\n\nEdit 2: Here's a link to a thread in r\/suicidewatch talking about a very similar event, but magnitudes worse.

The worker certainly cannot exercise his self-ownership outside the terms of the contract. His freedom, while acting within private property and during company time, is limited by the terms within the work contract. For the duration stipulated in the contract, the boss owns the entirety of the worker's labor.\n\nHowever, while the outcome of the labor (commodity) can be alienated, one cannot be separated from one's labor - it is inalienable. To purchase one's labor is to purchase one's body. The only difference between wage labor and slavery is the mode of purchase of the labor. In slavery, the purchase is permanent. In wage labor, the boss only rents it during the stipulated term.\n\nThe fact that in wage labor the individual can change jobs and master does not change the underlying relationship of authority and of ownership of one by the other. \n\nIt could even be argued that feudal servitude was more distant from slavery than wage labor: servants could occupy the land of a Lord as long as they paid their taxes and fees through seasonally appropriate labor. After the servant had paid for the use of his Lord's means of production (land) with his labor, he was also allowed to carry out his own cultivation in the Lord's lands.\n\nAnd as the modern man could simply look for a new job, so could the servant pack up and look for work in the lands of a Lord who offered less expensive fees.\n\nWoe to the modern worker, who is less master of his labor than a servant; who is not sold as a slave but rents himself as such!\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"'Woe to him who does not own his labor!': a critique of 'voluntary' wage slavery"}

To each according to need in this context means that those with children should be paid more than those who are single. Those with speci c disabilities which give rise to special needs should be compensated. These are now very familiar principles to us. They lie at the foundation of the welfare state with child bene ts, family tax credits, disability living allowances, medical treatment on the basis of need etc. What Marx was saying is that as society becomes richer it will be able to a ord a much more comprehensive and generous welfare provision. And who can now doubt that he is right. Rich France can provide a welfare state that would be totally infeasible in poor Co\u0302te d'Ivoire. \nBut it is important to note that there is no suggestion in what Marx wrote here, or in his economic writings, that he was an advocate of general free distri- bution.

I want to know what factors make someone more likely to do a 180 and undergo leftwing radicalization. I often think of working class white people in particular, who are posed to stop blaming individuals once they realize it's the powers that be who are responsible. Today @dansmonsarbre tweeted \"No immigrant has taken a job from a 'real american.' You were laid off by a capitalist who took advantage of that immigrant to increase his profits, and nothing makes him happier than to hear that you're a fucking idiot who's actually mad at the immigrant and not him\". It reminded me of when Scott Kurashige wrote, \u201cwhile the counter-revolution draws its energy from real and perceived economic anxiety, it scapegoats non-elite social actors for problems that are structural in nature\u201d.\n\nI know there's not a quick solution b\/c the trump \"community\" has diverse interests and desires, and that it's a generalization to say that it all boils down to fox news and dog-eat-dog neoliberal ideology that explains it. My thing is, not every user of t_d is committed to the delusion that there's a biological basis for white supremacy right? Aren't there less ideological ones with opinions that can be more easily swayed? How do you get through to them? Then again, it's so hard to argue with someone if they're flat out rejecting solid facts in favor of another narrative, or if you're trying to argue with someone about ethics. It's emotionally draining to see thousands of t_d users finding humor in comparing immigrant child in emergency blankets to hotdogs in tinfoil. Where the fuck do u even begin with that? How do I go on with the knowledge that there are people that show such a capacity for dehumanization? I feel useless.\n\nAlso, how come the atmosphere on t_d is so damn rabid? I get it, they're trying to be provocative with their \"spicy memes\" and they love a good libtard tantrum, and a bunch are probably being tongue in cheek by mimicking Trump's over the top style. But they come across as so damn frenzied and detached when half the titles feature all caps and exclamation points. It's all \"HERE'S-WHY-THE-LEFT-SHOULD-FEEL HUMILIATED\"-this and hot-chick-in-a-maga-hat that. And the bullshit cherry picking that goes on in their hateful circlejerk is enough for you to make a lifetime supply of pie with.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"It's been sent forth into the echo chamber a thousand times already but I need to get my thoughts out"}

{"author":"Arantele","created_utc":1529866807,"num_comments":0,"score":6,"selftext":"The driving force behind American society is money. People plan their lives around it, \n\nand it plans out people\u0092s lives. Someone is considered to be successful, not by how hard he works or by how happy he is,\n\nbut by how much money he has made. Americans lust over it so greatly that most criminal actions are committed in\n\nan attempt to get more of it. The captivating beauty of cupidity determines the course of people\u0092s lives, \n\nshapes what companies produce, and decides who is going to be the next president.\n\nSo many people today labor under student debt, mortgages and an uncertain pay flow from employers.\n\nSomething which has resonated strongly with me were the words from Star Trek First Contact:\n\nAs Captain Jean-Luc Picard explained, \"The acquisition of wealth is no longer the driving force of our lives. \n\nWe work to better ourselves and the rest of humanity.\"\n\nWith our society so focused on money as a growth factor what I've witnessed is that many people, and myself to\n\nan extent have become afraid of money or even loathesome of it because money creates false assumptions. \n\nIn addition to creating assumptions, money also develops an interpersonal fixation; \n\nfixation on money as an object develops infatuation in the pursuit rather then the outcome.\n\nThe fixation creates an individual whose life is defined by his\/her job and no longer by what their passions \n\nmight be. No longer is success defined by how happy we might be or where we are in life but rather\n\nSuccess in society is based on material wealth leading people to always want more then they already have, \n\ncreating the problem of over consumption, and over consumption and being American go hand in hand. We waste\n\njust as much as we create. Technology is continually updated driving us to want the newest, coolest thing out there.\n\n60&amp;#37; of the waste is outdated technology suggests that people rely too heavily on technology and consequently rely \n\ntoo heavily on money to constantly acquire and upgrade these goods. \n\nMoney serves to control people\u2019s lives. Money only gives the illusion of power to the person who possesses it. \n\nAnother thing I often hear and heard every once in a while from my family was the line \"its nice to have nice things\",\n\nand I can't go against that logic. It is nice to have nice things, very nice in fact and even more so \n\nconvienent. So one has to wonder whether its simply nice to have nice things, or if its nice to have them because\n\nthey make out lives more convienent then they were before. Technology has done this for us.... we've bought in\n\nto the premise that technology makes our lives simpler, and while this is true to some degree, we can't \n\nunderestimate how much more complicated its made things as well. Technology only exists because there is \n\na drive for money that forces people to continually update and upgrade the things they already have. \n\nBecause people are left with no choice and cannot halt the process, people are really under the control of money. \n\nAll of this begs the question, if a monetary reward wasn't at the end of the tunnel when creating new technologies\n\nwould we still strive to create, strive to explore, strive to discover? I'd like to answer yes, but I'd only be \n\nanswering for myself and a small percentage of society I think it through. Society is based around \n\nthe accumulation of money. It is what drives a person's assumptions, fixation, environment, \n\nsuccess, control, and aspirations..... aspirations you say? yes indeed, money serves to place a limit \n\non the aspirations of people because in order to achieve their goals they need to attain a certain level \n\nof financial security. As we strive for personal wealth and status based upon money we must understand, that\n\nunlike you, money does not care about what happens to a person, yet the person cares about what happens to the money.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t understand the struggle of people for freedom, for equality, for food. Your money will never care\n\nwhat happens to you, no matter how much you care what happens to your money.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Money for nothing!"}

Her proof is an [article](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-us-canada-41871956) from BBC reporting on documents that were released by the FBI. A catchy headline wasn't enough, though. I said, well, where's the source? So, we keep reading and they show the FBI documents. Finally, I can see whether or not this is true.\n\nThe first document has about two to three paragraphs stating that MLK was heavily associated with the Communist party. In the document, they make it very clear that aligning with Marxist ideals is a bad thing. \"...because of his being a minister of religion, does not dare to espouse it publicly.\" \n\nThese documents are dated in 1968. We had just came down from a massive red scare a decade earlier, and on top of that, we were in the middle of The Cold War. This was my first suspicion that this was just propaganda. After all, FBI director [J. Edgar Hoover was scared of MLK at the time](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/retropolis\/wp\/2017\/12\/13\/an-old-letter-sheds-light-on-fbis-malice-toward-martin-luther-king-jr\/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.b589199eb225).\n\nThen, we went to the document that claimed MLK had been cheating. Apparently, it was none other than third party hearsay. King allegedly had all night orgies and \"negro prostitutes were paid $50.00.\" \n\nAt this point I was convinced. This was all just propaganda. Fake news.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Fake News MLK"}

{"author":"Genora51","created_utc":1530011524,"num_comments":14,"score":26,"selftext":"Browsing this subreddit recently (as a lurker), I have noticed a worrying trend in the way we respond to outsiders.\n\nOn many posts, there will be one of two things:\n\n1. A reactionary\/facsism apologist\n2. A liberal who has found themselves here somehow\n\nThe problem I have noticed is that this subreddit seems to treat both these two the same way: calling them a reactionary or a fascist and telling them to f\\*\\*\\* off. Now, I'm absolutely fine with that behaviour in the first instance, but the fact that this subreddit seems to treat the second case in the same case worries me for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirstly, it doesn't look good on any count. It turns the liberal away from anarchism (which they were presumably flirting with as an ideology if they ended up here in the first place) and it makes us look like a bunch of intolerant a\\*\\*holes. While, as a whole, the online anarchist community doesn't much like liberals, it is easy to forget that it's not an insurmountable step from liberalism to left-libertarianism. Furthermore, especially in the cases of liberals who are browsing this subreddit, these people are often genuinely curious about anarchism and its ideas, and to treat them no better than we do fascists is an easy way to put someone off the ideology altogether.\n\nSecondly, it suggests that this subreddit's community has a problem distinguishing ignorance from apathy from disdain. In the first case, it is important to remember that many people are simply not as clued up on the news or international affairs as others, even if those affairs are important or far-reaching. Don't assume that everyone keeps up to date with the world. Apathy is a common cause for being out of the loop in this regard. After all the awful events of the past few years, many people have shut themselves off from the news, assuming (mostly correctly) that it is only ever bad news. People in these two groups are likely to be open to new ideas, and so should not be treated as enemies. Only in the third case (disdain) should we take a hard line.\n\nSo how do we as a community go about fixing this problem?\n\nPersonally, I think it comes down to a bit of extra thought before responding to a comment or post. Try to be empathetic, and see if that person's viewpoint can be understood in terms other than fascism or reactionaryism. Err on the side of caution: if you can't be sure if they are a troll, assume not or don't respond at all. In not responding, if they are a troll or fascist they will have lost in their quest to enrage or \"trigger\" us, and if they are a liberal then they may not be so easily turned away from anarchism and its ideas.\n\nThis may not be the right way to change this situation, and I'm certainly open to any suggestions.\n\nTLDR: Lost liberals get treated the same way as fascist trolls, and I think we should be a bit more tolerant in the comments.\n\nEdit: Words","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Fixing this subreddit"}

Just to clarify a couple things, my nonprofit is a crowdfunding platform that enables everyday people to hire lobbyists. The reason we are doing this is that lobbying is the MOST effective way to influence government and get a new policy passed. Right now, over 95&amp;#37; of lobbyists work for corporations or special interest groups and very few work for the public interest groups. If we had lobbyists on our side, we could level the playing field between us and corporations. It seems that some people think I am downplaying the impact money has in politics, I am not. I am simply pointing out the research which shows what lobbying is and why lobbying, not campaign donations, are the real reason for the imbalance of power in politics.\n\nUPDATE#2: Ok, that is it from me. I enjoyed this experience even though it was a rough crowd. I did the AMA to try and show people that lobbying is an effective tool. Businesses use it to get government to work for them and regular people do not have access to it, and that is what we are trying to change. The actual practice of lobbying is not as nefarious as everybody thinks and, as you can see by this thread, it is extremely misunderstood. Thanks to all those who were positive about the idea and asked great questions, I really appreciated hearing your thoughts and feedback.

{"author":"soccerskyman","created_utc":1530142953,"num_comments":24,"score":94,"selftext":"Saw this on Tumblr and found it interesting. What do you guys think?:\n\nBack in the 80\u2032s if you were a pissed off anarchist that wanted to burn down a building, you probably checked your home for listening devices and made a plan. If you were the same kind of pissed off anarchist in the late 90\u2032s, you\u00a0 turned off your phone and encrypted your online traffic. In the 2020\u2032s we\u2019re gonna have to change our strategies once again. Intelligence gathering has adapted and so we must adapt too.\n\nTo get a head start at this, let\u2019s look at how big data analysis is being used. To do this, we\u2019ll need to talk about 3 things: *metadata, patterns and networks.* Those sound boring and complicated but I\u2019m not a techy and I won\u2019t bore you with tech language, I\u2019ll keep it as easy as I can.\n\n**Metadata:** In the context of online activity, \u2018content\u2019 means \u2018the message you send\u2019 and \u2018metadata\u2019 means \u2018everything other than the content\u2019. So, for example, if you send your friend a text about lunch, the content might be *\u201cLet\u2019s go out for lunch\u201d* and the metadata might be *\u201cMessage send at 01\/04\/2018 11.32 from phone 0478239055 to phone 079726823 using Signal\u201d*.\n\nThis information is registered by your phone even if the app encrypts your actual message. Your metadata is very badly protected by technology and very badly protected by the law. No matter which country you are in, most of your metadata if freely available to intelligence agencies regardless of whether you are a suspect in anything.\n\n**Patterns:** Whether you realize it or not, your metadata has a pattern. If you have a daily job you might have a very consistent pattern, if you do not your pattern might be more flexible but you have a pattern. If someone wanted to know the rhythm of your day, they could very easily do so because your pattern is in the metadata.\n\nFor example: Maybe you use the wifi at your favourite bar on most Sunday nights until about midnight, you wake up around 10 AM and check your Signal, you use your public transport card to get to class every Monday afternoon and you spend on average 1 hour on Tumblr twice a day. All this is part of your pattern.\n\n**Networks:** You have online networks. Your facebook friends, the people in your phone adress book, the dropbox you share with coworkers, everyone who bought online tickets to the same punk band you attended, the people using the same wifi points as you. Take your networks, combine them with other people\u2019s networks, and *clusters* reveal themselves. Your work community, your family, your activist scene, etc.\n\nIf you are in an anarchist community that will probably be abundantly clear from all your minor network connections like going to the same band and knowing the same people as other anarchists. Even if you never liked an anarchist facebook page or pressed \u2018going\u2019 on an anarchist facebook event, your network is hard to hide.\n\n**Now, let\u2019s say you commit a crime,**\n\nthe kind that would result in some serious research. Let\u2019s say that on Sunday night 3 AM, you are your friends go out and burn down a nazi\u2019s house. (Of course I would never advice any of you to do such a thing.) It\u2019s obvious that anarchists did it but there are no other clues. You use traditional style security culture: you burn your notes, you are careful not to communicate about your plans near technology and you do not leave physical traces.\n\nBut because you commited the crime that night, your *metadata* will vary strongly from your usual rhythm: you stay at your usual bar until 2 AM to wait for your friends, you do not wake up at 10 AM in the morning so you do not check your Signal or Tumblr until 1 PM. You do not go to class. Your metadata pattern is very different from your usual pattern. The metadata patterns of your friends are different too. If one of you is clumsy, they might generate a super suspicious metadata signal like a phone being switched off at 2.30 AM and activated at 4AM. You wouldn\u2019t be the first.\n\nIf I wanted to solve this crime using data analysis, what I would do is:\n\n* let a piece of software run a pattern analysis of the local anarchist scene to generate the 300 people most connected to the anarchist scene.\n* let a second piece of software analyse the metadata patterns of those 300 people over the last months and identify the biggest metadata variations around Sunday night as well as very suspicious metadata activity\n* Illiminate pattern variations with an obvious cause or an obvious alibi (people who are on vacation, people who are in the hospital, people who lost their job, etc).\n* Do indepth research into the ones that remain.\n\nWhich is how, out of a massive amount of people that I couldn\u2019t possible all listen to at the same time, I could quickly identify a few to monitor closely. This is how I could find and catch you.\n\n**So, now what?**\n\nIf traditional security culture doesn\u2019t protect us as well as it used to, how do we adapt? Well, I don\u2019t have all the answers but for a start, I\u2019d say: know your network + know your pattern.\n\nIn the case of the example above: leave the bar at midnight, return home and put your phone on your bedside table. Check the apps you check before going to bed and set your alarm to 10AM. Return to the bar without your phone. Wake up at 10AM and check your Signal. Drag yourself to class or ask a comrade to make the trip with your travel card and do not use technology in your home while the comrade is taking your travel card to class. Stick to your pattern. Never *ever* turn off your phone.\n\nYou might also be able to manipulate your network but that seems much harder to do. Not having a smartphone and dropping out of all social activity online is\u00a0 a big commitment. Knowing your data pattern and making sure your data pattern doesn\u2019t look out of the ordinary? Much less commitment.\n\nSome of the old rules will still apply: don\u2019t talk about a crime around devices with microphones, don\u2019t brag after a succesful action, etc. Other rules, like \u2018turn off your phone when planning an illegal act\u2019 need to change because their metada looks too out of the ordinary. No one switches off their phone anymore. We look suspicious as fuck when we do.\n\nThis is just one idea on how we could update our security culture. There are probably other people with other, better ideas about updating our security culture. If we start the conversation, we may get somewhere.\n\n**Finally: we need to keep adapting.**\n\nAs technology changes, more information is becoming available, including data we have very little control over. Smart-tv\u2019s and ads in public spaces that listen to every word we say and the tone of our voice when we say it are examples. Data analysis projects are currently using license plate reading software on security footage to map the travel patterns of cars. A lot suggests they may soon be ready to do the same with face recognition, at which point the presence of our face in public space becomes part of our metadata. More information means more accurate data analysis. Our metadata may soon be too vast annd too complex to completely map and mirror. Which means we will need to adapt our counter measures if you want to hide something.\n\nHow do we keep it all under the radar? I don\u2019t know. But let\u2019s try to figure this shit out. These are some first thoughts about what security culture should look like in the age of modern big data analysis and I\u2019d be very happy for any insights from comrades that have some thoughts on this.\n\nAlso: feel free to distribute and rework these words without credit.\n\nsource: [http:\/\/queeranarchism.tumblr.com\/post\/173458517518\/](http:\/\/queeranarchism.tumblr.com\/post\/173458517518\/)","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Never ever turn off your phone: rethinking security culture in the era of big data analysis"}

It\u2019s the mission of specifically antifa to decisively deal with fascist militants that actively believe in genocide and are working to further that agenda. You can\u2019t do this by putting out a call to counter protest and hoping enough competent people show up during their action to oppose them. If you are prepared enough, you can meet them at a more creative time and place. Take that as you will.\n\nDue to the efforts of antifa and the general incompetency of Nazi organizers, the alt-right wave is faltering, but this may lead to more isolated and more dangerous groups and individuals taking action themselves.

{"author":"kevinfat2","created_utc":1530381863,"num_comments":87,"score":23,"selftext":"Veganism is growing and I think it should be a core aspect of what it means to be part of the anarchist philosophy. And I don't mean that we should be vegans to prevent animal suffering. I mean we should adopt the whole foods plant based diet because that is what is healthy. We've been lied to by the propaganda system into thinking that animal products are healthy for us.\n\nIf you're reading this then you're familiar with all the propaganda and doctrinal system effects for everything from distorting the wars started by the US and history more generally. You're familiar with Edward Bernays and more. You're familiar with how the pharmaceutical industry lies about the effectiveness and safeness of their drugs. I will explain how the same is true about animal products.\n\nIf you want more details from nutritional research then I recommend Colin Campbell's book The China Study or https:\/\/nutritionfacts.org\/\n\nBut on the propaganda aspect there is a propaganda effort to convince us that for example the high levels of saturated fat in animal products is good for us. \"Butter is back\" is the message. Consumption of saturated fat leads to elevated levels of cholesterol. You will encounter counter arguments from the propaganda system about how there is zero correlation between saturated fat intake and cholesterol. Saturated fat intake increases cholesterol. This paradox is explained by the following paper.\n\n\"Diet and serum cholesterol: do zero correlations negate the relationship?\"\nhttps:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/313701\n\nTo summarize they model the relationship between diet and blood serum cholesterol as a simple linear regression model and make a point that if you make general ballpark estimates at a certain error term's variance taking into account uncertainty in measurements, age, race, sex, blood drawing technique then it could easily be that the correlation is near zero even if the underlying model is a linear increase between diet and cholesterol.\n\nI was able to read their paper because I have a degree in mathematics. But the general person out there won't understand the statistics and mathematics in that paper.\n\nI find when I explain this to friends of mine who aren't anarchists and skeptical of the power system they are very willing to believe the message that butter, cheese, meat, milk is all good for them.\n\nMoreover, you look for metabolic ward studies where you lock people in a room to have full control over what they eat and you find consumption of animal products leads to elevated cholesterol. I keep reading about keto and paleo being good for the heart. I have yet to find a single study where they\nlock people in a room and feed them a keto diet and see their cholesterol go down. Like literally you can open these keto books and their is literally zero citations for a metabolic war study.\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Why we should all go vegan."}
