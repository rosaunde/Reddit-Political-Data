I've always found it somewhat ironic that the same people who advocate for the use of direct action to suppress fascism, are often the same ones who advocate for the state's monopoly on determine who may own or use a firearm, and what types of firearms may be possessed.   \n\nOne of the reasons why I find this ironic is that the invention and mastery of firearms, tended to have a dramatic shift on the nature of society and power politics, in a similar manner to the discovery and mastery of iron smelting and manufacture.  Prior to firearms, the most effective military forces were composed of, primarily, aristocrats or employed by aristocrats, as the cost of entry put effective military equipment beyond the means of the lower-classes;  those without access to mail, swords, and, horses, were forced to rely on those who had such equipment to protect them.   I feel that this directly impacted the way societies were organized, creating stratified power structures that severely limited the liberty of those who were not among the elite.    Social mobility largely was limited to those who were able to excel in military functions.   \n\nFirearms, as iron before them, changed that, dramatically.   A man at arms or knight who, previously, could have withstood a dozen or more of his \"inferiors\", was now confronted with the realization that a lowly peasant armed with a handgonne or hackbutt could now lay that knight low with a month of training, and a weapon that cost a fraction of the man-at-arms armory.   This had a number of effects on the organization of states:  I find it no accident or coincidence that the increasing centralization of large european states and the corresponding decrease in the power of magnates occurred beside the development and advancement of firearms.   \n\nI find it interesting that the group of people who are most priviliged in our society(white, middle aged, middle class males) are also those who have the highest rates of gun ownership, while those who are marginalized are most often those who have very low rates of gun ownership.   As well, as a southerner, I am aware that many of our gun control laws were passed with the idea of limiting firearms ownership from blacks, rather than any desire to reduce crime.   In fact, many national firearms laws seem to have their origin in attempts to restrict ownership of firearms by minorities and the poor.   This of course, make's perfect sense:  If they prevent people who are oppressed from owning the means to defend themselves from oppression, then you limit the ability of the oppressed to defend themselves.

So that means the jig is up, the secret is out, so I might as well let you all in on it now.\n\nFirst things first: the Soviet Union never fell. We were just lulling the West into a false sense of security and complacency, waiting for the perfect time to strike. Putin's not a right-wing strongman, he's the new hardliner General Secretary of the CPSU and he's been purging his rivals behind the scenes.\n\nSecond: I'm a Soviet sleeper agent. My parents were a sleeper family placed here in the late 1950s. As you could all tell, my programming was activated back in May and I've been spreading propaganda since in preparation for tomorrow's events.\n\nThirdly: the Revolution is coming tomorrow. AntiFa supersoldiers grown in secret Soviet labs since the 90s will be awakened and set loose to scalp any white male on sight. Local small business owners are going to be rounded up and executed by guillotine in the town square of all major towns and cities, on live TV on all channels because we have of course infiltrated all major media organizations. So stay indoors and keep your heads down. We had originally planned to carry this all out on the centennial of the Russian Revolution, November 7, but since that's a work day we've had to move it up to the weekend.\n\nOf course, this would normally have all gone off without a hitch, flawlessly planned, but that meddling hacker 4chan and his allies somehow caught wind of this and now every gun-toting grandma is ready for us.

I want to make that movie. \n\nThe intention; inceptionesque marketing. To distribute an idea, plant incentives and harvest action, this saga will definitely be anarcho-communist propaganda. \n\nBasically, how do you help the masses understand we are currently living in crisis? An option could be exaggeration, fantastical yet relatable entertainment, with the hopes of raising consciousness through cultural consumption, observation, and reflection. \n\nThere exists a neoliberal cinema, promoting a certain type of consumption, profiting a certain market. Why do you think one has to visit a shopping center nowadays to watch a blockbuster movie? Examples: Cinepolis, Cinemex, Regal Cinemas, AMC, Arclight, y todas esas chingaderas..\n\nThere also exists a neo-realist cinema, something that began a long time ago and was incorporated in different regions of the world, but also shouldn't be left as something of the past. When was the last time you saw a neo-realist zombie saga? The walking dead? GoT? Nope. I ask myself why there hasn't ever been a taquero/taquera in a zombie story, or why there are no mention of indigenous folks, or why zombies never appear in real-life geopolitical spaces like the borderlands, or in social spaces like a tianguis (market), or in the metro (subway) of Mexico City, or why certain social groups are excluded from these narratives.. And my response to this is that zombie story doesn't exist, or at least not yet. I want to see a zombie film one day that truly honors the worker, that follows indigenous cosmovisions, that challenges current hegemonic forms of power, and that shows real life characters and real life reactions &amp; responses to a worldwide crisis based on actual groups of resistance present among the human race today. One example is the CIG-CNI and the EZLN in Mexico (the Indigenous Council for Governance, the National Indigenous Congress, and the Zapatista Army of National Liberation). \n\nI myself am a Mexican national, a migrant-student and son of parents twice deported from the united estates currently living in Mexico. I study and practice film &amp; video production. I like to write. One day I would like to watch a zombie series that demonstrates the abolition of borders and the events that could follow that. But I know I'll never see that happen if I don't act upon it myself and seek assistance to make it happen, either in real life or in make believe. I want to package the idea that \"a new world is possible. A bigger one. A better one. One in which many worlds fit...\" into an apocalyptic narrative with true-to-life characters in true-to-life spaces. \n\nThe protagonists; a vendor in a market, an anarchist student from UNAM, a woman going home on the metro, a bus driver, a kid washing windshields at a stoplight, a grandma and her family in the hood, among many more. \nThe antagonists; zombies, cops, other armed forces including border patrol, the bourgeois, corporate elites, government officials, paramilitary groups, among others, including nature in some cases. \n\nI'm looking to set it in Mexico initially, but estimating to expand the story into other regions as well. I want it to be gritty, I want it to be funny, I want it to be scary, I want it to be sad, I want it to inspire hope. I want to tell the stories that aren't being told. Overall I want it to be metal as fuck. I want to watch the world burn in order to see it be reborn. I think entertainment is a powerful tool used to modify human behavior, and I want to produce entertainment that inspires positive action. \n\nIf you'd like to contribute any ideas I'd love to hear them.\n\ntl:dr,\nI'd like to make an anarchist apocalyptic film or series one day, and I'm looking for folks to collaborate on story/world-building.

After some time I have a rough format for this infograph with some points I intend to expand on in the actual infograph. If you all can read this over and give your opinion on it, that'd be great.\n\nOutline:\n\nA. Title (So You Googled Murray Bookchin)\n\nB. Who is Bookchin?\n\n* Born in 1921, the son of Russian immigrants. He adopted Russian populist ideas as he grew up, and joined Communist organizations.\n* He started defining himself as an anarchist in the late 50s and developed his ideas on Social Ecology\n* His ideas on Libertarian Municipalism were fully-formed in the 80s\n* In the late 90s, Bookchin broke from anarchist political ideology and started identifying as a Communalist\n\nC. Social Ecology\n\n* Include the [Sustainable development Venn diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Sustainable_development.svg)\n* Current environmental problems are caused by social issues stemming from hierarchical modes of social organization\n* The market system\u2019s \u201cdo-or-die\u201d nature is inherently antagonistic to the environment\n* Our social systems must be built on a basis of complementarity and mutual aid for nature to survive\n\nD. Libertarian Municipalism\n\n* Municipal governments must be reformed in directly-democratic bodies.\n* Confederations of municipal bodies will formed as a replacement for the nation-state model\n* The transition to municipal confederations will create a state where the nation-state and these municipal bodies will no longer be able to coexist, thus leading to the downfall of the nation-state.\n\nE. Communalism\n\n* The Synthesis of Bookchin's ideas\n* The abolishment of social hierarchy, including that of capitalism and the nation-state\n* Confederations of municipal citizens\u2019 assemblies\n\nF. Ending\n\n* Recommended Reading list\n\nSo my goal with this is for it to be a basic introduction to those unfamiliar to any of these concepts, and a gateway to more in-depth study. Any suggestions for changes are greatly appreciated, as I'm not as familiar with Bookchin as I should be. I'll try to get all of your suggestions sorted, and hopefully have this thing done by sunday.\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"A rough draft for a Bookchin infograph"}

{"author":"OmgKidGetAJob","created_utc":1510147157,"num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"So I've done some digging the past hour, forewarning I haven't put much research into this. So I started here (http://news.bitofnews.com/the-9-most-powerful-weapons-manufacturers-in-the-world/). Basically learned that the US based company Lockheed Martin is the largest arms manufacturer in the world.\n\nSo I looked into it's shareholders, (http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/lmt/institutional-holdings). This oddly Orwellian name \"STATE STREET CORP\" owns over 50 Million shares in Lockheed, which is twice what the next lowest investor owns. I have not looked into any other business yet as it's getting late.\n\nWell what I did find on state street, which was very sparse, I found here on their website (http://investors.statestreet.com/Board-of-Directors). Which states \"His leadership experience and core understanding of State Street\u2019s full range of services brings to the Board a detailed, innovative and thorough perspective on State Street\u2019s key operations, strategic initiatives and client relationships globally. Mr. Hooley serves as a member of the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a member of the Financial Services Forum in Washington D.C.\". That bolded company (yes they are private) are 1 of 12 companies that make up the federal reserve.\n\nAlthough Mr. Hooley does not serve as on the Board of Governors for the Federal Reserve, he does have influence over that and more directly over the entirety of New England, as that is Boston Fed's coverage.\n\nIt is my rough understanding that the Federal Reserve is the Federal Government's Reserve of Money, and that's how the US does its banking and prints its notes. I did some research just to be clear, and apparently the Feds are inseperable from Fraction-reserve Banking, so here's this excerpt from a senate hearing\n\n*The inflation and business cycles generated by fractional reserve banking are greatly intensified by Federal Reserve and U.S. Government interference in the banking industry. The most dangerous forms of such interference are the power of the Federal Reserve to create bank reserves out of thin air via open market operations, its uses of these reserves to bail out failing banks in its role as the lender of last resort, and Federal insurance of bank deposits. In the presence of such policies, the deposits of all banks are perceived and trusted by the public as one homogeneous brand of money substitute, fully guaranteed by the Federal Government and backed up by the Fed\u2019s power to print up bank reserves and bail out insolvent banks. Under such a monetary regime, there is absolutely no check on the inherent propensity of fractional reserve banks that borrow short and lend long to issue unbacked money substitutes, to expand the money supply, and to artificially depress interest rates. The solution to the problem is to treat banking as any other busi-ness and permit it to operate in a market completely free of govern-ment guarantees of bank deposits and assurance of Fed bailouts. In order to achieve this ideal, the Fed would have to be perma-nently and credibly deprived of its legal power to create reserves from nothing. The best way to do this is to establish a genuine gold standard, in which gold coins would circulate as cash and serve as bank reserves. At the same time, the Fed must be stripped of its authority to issue notes and conduct open market operations.\" (https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/112-141.pdf). This is a 30 minute read I would recommend to anyone.\n\nIn summary- The US government gives out $billions of military contracts to lockheed (more than any other company), which it gets from the federal reserve, which is ran by the banks who invest in Lockheed. This is only 1 company, yet it is the biggest company and the first thing I could find on the subject. There is no way it ends here.\n\nThoughts? Corrections? More importantly, is there more I can read that y'all have available? Thank you.\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Military Industrial Complex (x-post)"}

It was a time when many people of Russia suffered under miserable conditions and oppression from the czarist regime. When WWI happened, it pushed people's patience to the limit, causing them to rebel. The czar was forced to abdicate, and a republic was founded. But the republic failed to bring a speedy end to WWI, so the Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, overthrew the government in response. \n\nWhat was hoped to be a revolution of liberation turned out to be a nightmare. Lenin had many dissidents killed. Those who questioned the ideology of Bolshevism were massacred. Anarchists, who opposed state control in place of the capitalist system, were slaughtered left and right. The Russian Revolution became counterrevolutionary as the state seized control over the economy and the country and left little to no room for the control of the people.\n\nWhat Lenin did helped set up the stage for Stalin, who used the ideology of Bolshevism and state socialism to make a even worse nightmare. Millions would die in purges and forced relocations. And a totalitarian apparatus was established that would crush opposing thoughts and silence millions.\n\nThe USSR was nothing more than a complete and utter disaster. It created a totalitarian hellhole, and when the truth about the USSR would be released, it would forever damage the credibility of socialism forever. There is nothing to celebrate about an event that would lead to a statist nightmare. There is nothing to celebrate about a country that killed its own people and replaced one system of oppression with another. There is nothing to celebrate about the leaders who would be responsible for the atrocities.\n\nWe should get people to understand that the Russian Revolution happened because of how bad the conditions were that caused the whole debacle in the first place. But we need to admit that it helped set the stage for the most disastrous social experiment in modern history. But overall, an apologist for the USSR should be at the same level as an apologist for Nazi Germany and other fascist regimes. The Russian Revolution should be reviled as a massive failure that would do major damage to the reputation and credibility of leftism. It should be a warning to what happens when the fight for liberation loses its way. And it should never be viewed as a positive thing whatsoever.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Honestly There Should Be No Reason To Celebrate The 100th Anniversary of the Russian Revolution"}

When you're there, in their terminal, you're entirely at their mercy.\n\nNow I know most people aren't authoritarians or fascists (the TSA certainly is) but it's really depressing how willingly people are to go along with authoritarianism and fascism and people having their basic rights violated, especially if it doesn't directly affect them, and sometimes even if it does. How easily people accept it as necessary if they get a reassuring pat on their back from the elite.\n\nI especially feel this way because of how people reacted after I told them about my nothing less than traumatic experience. Telling me I should learn to keep my head down and accept \"reality\". Except there's a bloody big difference between accepting reality and accepting injustice.\n\nAnyway the whole thing has left me with a markedly lower opinion of people, and I've always been a big believer in them. And unfortunately a markedly lower opinion and quite frankly a prejudice against Americans. Now every time I realize someone is American I just feel less inclined to be nice to them. I know this is unacceptable and I know Americans themselves are victims of the TSA but it's a very visceral and I know not intellectual reaction that I can't help.\n\nI was wondering if anyone has any advice to combat this.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"How to keep cynicism, misanthropy, and, especially, prejudice at bay?"}

Gift-exchange is based on \u2018the capacity for actors (agents, subjects) to extract or elicit from others items that then become the object of their relationship\u2019.\n\nIn the famous book called *Gifts and Commodities*, Christopher A. Gregory (an economic anthropologist) suggests this is a general tendency.\n\nGift economies tend to personify objects. Commodity/market dominated economies, like our own, do the opposite: they tend to treat human beings, or at least, aspects of human beings, like objects. The most obvious example is human labor: in modern economics we talk of \u201cgoods and services\u201d as if human activity itself were something analogous to an object, which can be bought or sold in the same way as cheese, or tire-irons.\n\nGregory lays out a tidy set of oppositions. Gifts are transactions that are meant to create or effect \u201cqualitative\u201d relations between persons; they take place within a preexisting web of personal relations; therefore, even the objects involved have a tendency to take on the qualities of people.\n\nCommodity exchange (market), on the other hand, is meant to establish a \u201cquantitative\u201d equivalence of value between objects; it should ideally be done quite impersonally; therefore, there is a tendency to treat even the human beings involved like things. \n\n* **Sharing, pooling or what Graeber calls \"Communism\"**:\n\n\nAs Graeber defines it, everyday communism is:  \n\nAn  open-ended  agreement  between  two  groups,  or  even  two  individuals, to provide for the other; within which, even access to one another\u2019s possessions, followed  the  principle  of  \u2018from  each  according  to  their abilities, to  each  according  to their  needs\u2019. \n\nI prefer to speak of sharing instead.\n\nHere are some of its characteristics:\n\nWhat characterizes a sharing context comparatively is that it extends the circle of people who can enjoy the good implicated in a resource, for instance accessing a certain resource such as water. In other words, sharing food or drink is an action done for its own sake, putting the good of nourishment in the place of any specific goals that may be derivative of the transfer of food items, for instance the attempt to create obligations for the future. In this understanding, sharing is not a manifestation of an altruistic move, putting the goals of others above one's own goals, but rather one of renouncing derivative goals altogether in the face of intrinsic goods\u2014its intrinsic value if you will. In gift-giving contexts, by contrast, goals of various kinds (whether held jointly by the exchange partners or not, whether altruistic or egoistic) override the intrinsic good of whatever it is that is being provided. \n\nIt's important to distinguish exchange, which is usually  for  \u201cexternal\u201d  and  strategic  benefits  such  as  having  a  network  of  partners,  creating  obligations  for  the  future,  etc. (gift-exchange) or and more impersonal and violent benefits when it comes to market-exchang \u2013  from  sharing  that  entails  the  intrinsic  goods  of  receiving a share (sharing out) and of being accepted as a member of the community of humans with recognized needs (sharing in). \n\n\nUnlike what the economic fundamentalists would have you believe, sharing is not governed by either  ecological  need  and  pressure  nor  a  diffuse  notion  of  generosity  and  altruism.  \nThe  ethnographic  record  shows  that  sharing  takes  place  not  only  under  conditions of scarcity, and that it typically takes the form of demand sharing rather than apparently generous gift-giving. In fact, a number of cultural conditions have to be in place for sharing to work. Unlike  the case of exchange systems, these conditions are not formally institutionalized normative systems but, instead, complex systems of habitual practice. \nIn  the  ethnographic  cases (including those in capitalist societies),  sharing  works  because  people have a shared history of mutual involvements as kin, because they master numerous ways  of initiating  sharing  through  implicature  and  other  forms  of  talk,  and  finally  because  they  recognize  the  presence  of  others  as  the  (often  silent)  demand  that  it  constitutes  toward  those  who  have  and  who  are  in  a  position  to  give.  \n\nMany acts of sharing took place, and continue to take place, because they are initiated by the taker and social strategies are in place that decouple giving from receiving. Sharing may therefore take place (as said before) without the provider enacting and expressing charity. Often it takes place in a way that downgrades the act of giving as part of leveling any potential attempts of the giver to take political advantage from his or her economically advantaged position. Demand sharing not only inverts the sequence of action but also the tone of the transaction that is known as \u201ccharitable giving.\u201d There is no sharing without a demand. The demand need not be uttered, and it need not be the demand of a specific interlocutor since it is a demand for provisioning that emerges as a consequence of moral role relationships or as incurred by a particular situation of copresence, as I would prefer to call it. We need to recognize that one\u2019s mere bodily presence, underlined by addressing the other person in particular ways, is always a demand for being acknowledged as a partner, a personal being with legitimate needs. An appropriate definition of demand sharing is therefore much broader than the use of explicit demands such as \u201cGive me . . .\u201d leading to the appropriation of what one may think one is entitled to. The explicitness of the demand may differ and it may be entirely implicit very much like a \u201csilent demand\u201d. Humans are sufficiently able to put themselves into the situation of others to be able to know what the intrinsic goods of shared objects are for fellow humans without any demand being uttered.\n\nSharing is generally characterized by the preparedness to suspend measuring objects against one another (which means that sharing does not necessarily entail that everyone gets the same) in that situation and by the unwillingness to hang on to something in a particular situation.\n\nSharing breaks down, often to the out-spoken detriment of social agents, when the practices of relating, conversing, and interacting in spaces that are conducive to it are discontinued.\nIf  sharing  works  in  a  social  network  like  liquid  flowing  through  communicating  tubes,  then  it  is  not  the  external  situations  of  scarcity  or  affluence  that  keep  the system  working  but  the  maintenance  of  connections  from  within,  by  keeping the flow free of obstacles. Whether these moves are successful or not depends on the skillful mastery of kin relatedness, of conversation and co-presence that are individually trained and socially framed.\n\nThe ethnography of exchange systems and of sharing practices underline the fact that there are major differences between the two. Exchanges, (even ceremonial gift-exchange), are characterized not only by a sphere of personal competition (and probably play a major role in the emergence of inequality). These exchanges also create long-term obligations; require keeping a record of the biography of things; are instrumental for systematic intergenerational and interregional dependencies; and allow the forging of large-scale alliances, the reassurance of allegiances, and the building of followership and patronage. Not surprisingly, therefore,  these  exchanges  are  often  couched  in  ceremonies,  surrounded  by  taboos,  detailed  norms  and  rules.  We  find  very  little,  if  anything,  of  that  with  regard  to  sharing.  \nSharing is typically unceremonial. Instead of a formal handing over, we find arrangements whereby recipients are the initiators (\u201cdemand sharing\u201d), they are allowed to take,  they  may  be  critical  rather  than  grateful  (\u201cinsulting  the meat,\u201d \u201caccusing the hunter\u201d). \n\n\n**There are other economic modalities besides exchange and sharing.**","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Some comments on Communism, the Gift, Market and non-market relations"}

The ever more rapid destruction of ecosystems, the disruption of the climate, chemical pollution and diseases it causes, the rapid decline of biodiversity, the degradation of soil, the destruction of the rainforests, global social apartheid produced by the brutal development of inequality, and the rise of identitarian and religious violence are the main symptoms. These crises stem from the mode of production that became dominant over two centuries \u2014capitalism\u2014and the resulting patterns of consumption and mobility. This ecologically and socially unsustainable mode of development is leading the biosphere to collapse.\n\n2. **The only force that has anticipated this crisis is political ecology.** Political ecology has several currents, but alone among all political families, ecology considers it necessary to change the model of development by reducing our ecological footprint, by defending the ecosystems of the planet against predators, and by protecting the commons while meeting fundamental social needs. Ecology founded on the principles of autonomy, responsibility, and equilibrium calls for embracing universal values of protecting the land and human and non-human rights. The ecology movement became political in the 1980s in Europe and in other wealthy countries when the defense of daily culture converged with the question of the survival of the human species and the inclusion of specific methods of implementing democracy. It was organized by the Green parties, whose social base corresponded to the post-1968 student generation that had grown up during the affluent postwar decades. This social base can be referred to as the middle class, which has high cultural capital at its disposal and lives in the urban centers of large cities; it has configured political ecology in its own image and functions in its own interests. It advocates a politics of greening that sets standards from above and that regards adaptation to capitalism by means of a green economy as the horizon of political ecology.\n\n3. **Another ecology, issuing from the historical force of the poor, the ecology from below, arose in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.** This plebeian ecology, emerging from the large majority of the planet, animates everywhere struggles for the survival of humanity and of biodiversity. Native to the social periphery, it mobilizes millions of women and men against the financial and industrial oligarchy that is destroying the planet and threatening the survival of humanity and the conditions for life among the dispossessed throughout the world: against the destruction of forests, against large dams, against the extraction of oil and mineral resources, and for the survival of their languages and their cultural diversity, against industrial disasters, against environmental racism. \u2026 The ecology from below currently has not been translated into a formal politics. When it appears within the green parties, it is most often a minority.\n\n    It is expressed in organized social movements (MST in Brazil, Via Campesina, indigenous movements) and in the popular uprisings (the Water War in Bolivia, riots in China, anti-dam movements in India). It is still seeking its references, but already it has become indispensable, especially during such major meetings of political ecology as RIO + 20 or when tens of thousands of ecologists demonstrate against the green economy and its consequences and express through the Climate Justice network the requirements of social ecological movements \u2026 Gradually, the people\u2019s ecology is spreading in Western countries, in peasant communities fighting industrial agriculture and the chemical industry, in popular neighborhoods where pollution is invisibly concentrated, and diseases related to the environment, the consumption of junk food and the resulting obesity. Faced with the accumulating social and ecological injustices, a new political ecology is both necessary and possible.\n\n4. **These two poles of political ecology have their roots in an earlier story that has been divided since its inception.** Since the nineteenth century, a gap has widened between the scientific ecology from above, formed into large part by colonial science, hygienism, conservationism, and social Darwinism. Driven by the positivist ideology and the religion of unlimited progress, ecology from above influenced the first ecologists, often naturalists and environmentalists, in the twentieth century. On the other side, ecology from below is an ecology of transformation, of the people\u2019s ecology, emerging from the struggles of workers, peasants, and anticolonial peoples for survival. Struggles for survival are foundational to the people\u2019s ecology. The popular classes will defend not only their material conditions of life but also their natural environment, as capitalist modernity destroys their civilization.\n\n    Capital has destroyed the conditions of life and work of communities of peasants and artisans in the name of Progress, Science, and Reason. In this sense the Right as well as the Left have achieved a historic compromise based on liberal individualism. If we want to stop this process, the first task of the people\u2019s ecology is to decolonize the collective imaginary of the left and of ecology in fighting this religion of Progress and Scientism, which is the basis of middle-class domination over the popular classes. The Terra Nova Foundation calls leftists unconcerned about the future \u201cbobos,\u201d since they have de facto abandoned the popular classes in favor of abstention or the National Front; in so doing, they are following the logic of socialism and scientific ecology in despising the socialism of their origins, of workers, indigenous peoples, and peasant movements, claiming they are now archaic. The decolonization of the imaginary thus contributes to the rediscovery of the values and history of the disinherited, who are the exact opposite of the market society based on profit and competition exacerbated among individuals: they represent consociation, concern for others, the common ownership of land, the gift, mutual aid, cooperation, and civility.\n\n5. **he people\u2019s ecology was born in the nineteenth-century ecology of workers\u2019 associationism, agrarian populism, Luddism, civil disobedience, and libertarian geography.** Workers\u2019 associationism is the taproot of the social and solidaristic economy; Luddism is the root of the critique of industrialism and mechanization; agrarian populism emerged from struggles and wars of rural communities to defend their lifeways and existence against the development of another relation to earth and to commodification; civil disobedience originated in methods of noncooperation in struggles used from Thoreau to Gandhi and passing through the Landless of Brazil; the libertarian geography of Reclus and Kropotkin, countering sociobiology, developed the concept of mutual aid and cooperation.\n\n    The official history of ecology recounts its emergence as a passing of the baton from scientific ecologists to environmentalist and naturalist movements with bourgeois sensibilities toward nature. After 1968, a set of currents, born in the 1970s, from a cultural and generational movement nourished by various influences (feminism, Third World, pacifism and nonviolence, libertarian, socialist self-management) came together and gave birth to political ecology and the green parties. This story is false because it deliberately omits the ecology of the poor, which in the 19th and 20th centuries never ceased to fight capitalist modernity and the damage wrought by Progress.\n\n6. **The people\u2019s ecology, from its premises, is a rupture with the capitalist system with its limitless exploitation of resources, globalized trade, and capital accumulation.** Four key types of globalization underlie the ecological crisis.\n\n    \u2013 The first globalization was the triangular Atlantic trade system, based on human slavery, which resulted in the destruction of indigenous peoples and put in place extractivism, the grabbing of natural resources and raw materials.\n\n    \u2013 The second globalization, based on coal and steam energy, generated wage labor, forced labor, and productivism, that is, the religion of production based on the profits reaped by colonial empires. Meanwhile enclosures put an end to the common ownership of land and transformed millions of peasants into extensions of machines. The destruction of the peasant community coincided with the birth of the industrial proletariat.\n\n    \u2013 The third globalization, generated by oil exploitation, was that of Fordism and electricity, of consumerism and alienation.\n\n    \u2013 The fourth globalization, using nuclear power, peak oil and renewable energy, is contemporary with the planned obsolescence of products and of humanity itself. This era will lead either to barbarism and chaos or to a humanist Renaissance based on global citizenship and empathy. The current globalization threatens the very existence of humanity.\n\n    Reading these four globalizations through an ecological prism shows that capitalist modernity has always been based on the exploitation of the working classes and the destruction of their ecosystems. Those who are dominated have never ceased to contest the domination of human and of nature, as evidenced by Indian resistance, runaway slaves, slave revolts, riots and peasant wars, struggles for the rights and the health of workers, and nowadays the resistance to extractivism, huge dams, deforestation, and large unnecessary projects.\n\n    ###What Is the People\u2019s Ecology?\n\n7. **The people\u2019s ecology is neither mainstream nor neutral.** Ecology is intimately involved with social relations and confrontations from local to global. It places at the center of its thinking the conflict between the popular classes and the political and economic oligarchy, for the simple reason that all parts of humanity do not experience the ecological crisis in the same way. Inequalities in income, power, and cultural fluency, which lie at the root of ecological crises, ensure that some of us lack the capacity to protect ourselves from its effects. The aim of the people\u2019s ecology is to eradicate social inequalities, starting by decommodifying water, air, earth and in general all public goods (health, education, culture).\n\n    The financialization of the world is the highest stage of the fetishism of commodities, where the only standard is King Money and the level of material wealth is the index of calculating happiness. The people\u2019s ecology, against the dictatorship of the economic, has taken sides, and its preference for the poor finds strength in defending the living conditions of the poor, the disinherited, the dispossessed, the outcasts, and the unseen, to better fight ecological disaster. The crisis in climate, energy, and ecology will not be resolved within the mainstream but in the confrontation between the forces of the global economy and the people who are directly threatened by the crisis.\n\n8. **The people\u2019s ecology is a political and ideological current of the Green and international ecology movements.** It radically distinguishes itself from other tendencies:\n\n    \u2013 Environmentalism. This tendency reduces political ecology to nothing more than protection of the environment. But political ecology is a comprehensive and systemic approach to the relations among people, society, and nature. An environmentalism that only defends wildlife limits itself to one aspect of ecology and becomes NIMBY-type corporatism when it enters the political field.\n\n    \u2013 Deep ecology. This form of antihumanism emerged from conservationism, which has always excluded human beings from the ecosystem. Founded by the Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess, this school of thought is based on biocentrism, which reduces to antihumanism. Although the people\u2019s ecology criticizes anthropocentrism, it is not to be confused with an ecology that sets human beings outside nature\n\n    \u2013 Liberal ecology, sustainable development, green economics, and in general all those who want to place ecology in the service of greening capitalism. Liberal ecology, which reveres efficiency, is based on the commodification of ecology. It believes that Nature has a price and that its economy can be regulated to preserve Nature for future generations. Supporting a historic compromise with the capitalist system, which it considers invincible, and develops suitable mechanisms like carbon markets \u2026.\n\n    \u2013 The people\u2019s ecology. Pursuing the ecology of transformation, this radical ecology includes supporters of de-growth, social ecology, and eco-socialism. The ecology of transformation believes that capitalism cannot be reformed, and it sets about creating the conditions for overcoming it, through social practices, concrete struggles, and the elaboration of a political project that takes recourse neither to the laws of the market nor to the state as the supreme savior.\n\n9. **The people\u2019s ecology is not eco-socialism.** It is not a copy-and-paste of the theses of scientific socialism and ecology. It is not a successor of productivist socialism but exists as an alternative to it. So-called \u201cscientific\u201d socialism is based on belief that the development of productive forces desired and supported by the bourgeoisie has created the conditions for its own overthrow by the very class it helped form, the modern industrial proletariat.\n\n    This concept was reinforced by the ideology of Progress, the deification of science and technology, the development of technology at all costs regardless of its consequences, the disproportionate importance given to the role of the nation-state, and the negation of community identities. But capitalism went on to destroy peasant communities, the lifeways of artisans and tradespeople, and it enlisted millions of workers in an industrial army with no reference beyond the industrial and productivist revolution itself. In the colonies, it attacked ancestral civilizations based on the lands of the people it claimed to assimilate and civilize. . . .\n\n    The critique of technology is another difference between eco-socialism and the people\u2019s ecology. Marxism believes that technology is a neutral instrument that can and must be put at the service of the working class, that technology is a decisive factor for social transformation and progress. By contrast, the people\u2019s ecology considers that technology is becoming ever more autonomous and is endangering the earth and humankind. Nonetheless, eco-socialism is the intellectual tendency closest to the people\u2019s ecology. The overlaps are numerous, and they can work together as part of the same international network.\n\n10. **The people\u2019s ecology is not the same as de-growth.** Even if the principles of de-growth are applied to the entire world system, the people\u2019s ecology still finds it necessary to guarantee food, education, and health for the popular classes. Fair cultivation in these areas requires a model of eco-development based on social and ecological justice. In the South, in the poorest countries, but also in emerging and Western countries, this can translate into a policy of reparation (such as compensation for financial or ecological debt). The popular classes who have been excluded from the system may then get a boost through the growth of consumption and production in some areas. If decline in the ecological footprint is to be an absolute rule, it must not come at the expense of the popular classes. De-growth cannot mean recession. On the contrary, it must replace the quantitative growth of capitalism and its logic of accumulation with the logic of qualitative growth, which implies significant quantitative de-growth primarily in the dominant capitalist countries.\n\n11. **The people\u2019s ecology is an ecology of liberation.** It is an ecology of the poor in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Its founding figures are Chico Mendes, Vandana Shiva, and Ken Saro-Wiwa. It holds that the connections between Mother Earth and the poor prohibit the commodification of water, air, and earth. By liberating themselves, the poor liberate all of humanity and preserve the planet and all its components. The ecology of liberation has as a foundational principle that the earth is not to be owned.\n\n    The ecology of liberation is an ecology of survival. It demands access to rights as defined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including the rights to housing, health, and food.\n\n    The ecology of liberation has a spiritual dimension characterized by a rapprochement between Christian liberation theology and the idea of Mother Earth that is found in the peasant communities in the Andean highlands and elsewhere.\n\n12. **The people\u2019s ecology is an ecology of environmental justice.** This movement, born in the United States in the 1980s, struggles against ecological racism. The ecological crisis does not have the same impact in poor neighborhoods as it does in wealthier ones. Environmental inequalities merge with social and ethnic inequalities to structure a territorial and ethnic-social discrimination. The people\u2019s ecology is anti-discriminatory. In this sense it has a very strong relationship with the social ecology theorized by the libertarian ecological activist Murray Bookchin.\n\n13. **The people\u2019s ecology is an ecology of the commons.** The commons originated as an achievement of the farming community especially in the fight against \u201cenclosures,\u201d and it is at stake in social and ecological struggles today. Whether it opposes the patenting of life, land grabs, the appropriation of cyberspace, the privatization of culture, or control over natural resources and raw materials, the struggle for the commons is basic to the new ecological struggle of the peoples. The commons is reclaiming common goods, collective intelligence, and ancestral skills such as practical information that resists privatization.\n\n14. **The people\u2019s ecology is a transnational and alter-globalizing ecology.** It rests on organized social forces such as the peasant movement (La Via Campesina), movements against deforestation and large dams, the movement for Climate Justice, the movement against the imposition of useless large projects, the movements of indigenous peoples for survival, the movement for free software, and eco-unionism. It participates in the alter-globalization movement at social forums.\n\n15. **The people\u2019s ecology has affinities with eco-unionism.** Workers\u2019 struggles against against social and environmental injustices are part of the people\u2019s ecology. Struggles for occupational health against asbestos, lead poisoning, and toxic products are an essential dimension. The people\u2019s ecology, like eco-unionism, advocates self-management. It advocates the direct management of companies on a federalist and decentralized model but also user-citizen control over production and the environment.\n\n16. **The people\u2019s ecology is eco-feminist.** The patriarchal capitalist system has oppressed and exploited women as it has land. Eco-feminism holds that protecting of the integrity of life in all its forms against patriarchal domination is a unified fight. Industrialism has turned not only nature but the female body into merchandise. The domination of nature by humans is intrinsically linked to the domination of women by men. Humans cannot establish a new relation with nature without changing human relationships between women and men. Eco-feminism advocates principles such as reciprocity, mutual aid, solidarity, sharing, trust, care for others, respect for the individual, and responsibility with respect to all ecosystems.\n\n17. **The people\u2019s ecology is cosmopolitan.** The preservation of human diversity is an essential element in the struggle for the defense of the planet. Six thousand peoples compose the planet, and the preservation of their languages, cultures, and identities is a key feature of the ecological struggle. Financial globalization tries to standardize culture by imposing a standardized language and cultural production. The war of civilizations advocated by the American neoconservatives in the 1990s gave rise to a globalized racism against people who reject the new world order. There is no national ecology. The people\u2019s ecology is borderless and fights for global citizenship. Cosmopolitanism is the humanism of the twenty-first century.\n\n    ###The Strategy of the People\u2019s Ecology\n\n18. **The people\u2019s ecology fights for the creation of a new historic bloc: the coalition for the commons.** The struggle cannot depend on the cultured urban middle classes but must bring together those who represent the modern proletariat: intellectual workers, the precariat, parts of the industrial working class, petty officials, and peasant-workers. The people\u2019s ecology\u2019s allies in this new historical bloc are all the movements that fight for access to rights for everyone and for ecological democracy. This bloc is a coalition for the commons, among those who are fighting for physical common goods (water, earth, air) and so for the survival of humanity and those who fight for intangible common goods (information, culture, cyberspace) against the new enclosures. This bloc is a numerical majority. The great mass of working people share this desire for a revolution for the commons and for access.\n\n19. **The people\u2019s ecology seeks an ecological transition based on an alternative model of development that takes into account human needs and the limitations of the planet.** It rethinks the social utility of production, ways of consuming, the purpose of our products, and how they are produced. It advocates the relocalization of economic activity and the conversion of useless or predatory activities, and the redistribution of wealth and work. In the fight against productivist agriculture, it highlights agro-ecology and respects the peasantry\u2019s ancestral knowledge. The transitional program includes:\n\n    \u2013 an energy and industrial policy with a notable tightening of energy conservation, an end to nuclear power, the nonexploitation of unconventional sources of fossil fuels, and the use of local renewable energy\n\n    \u2013 the relocalization of the economy to avoid forced displacements and to restore control and fair resource sharing at the local level. It supports an informal popular economy and a new post-capitalist economy solidarity economy. . . .\n\n    To develop society\u2019s resilience to the ecological crisis, we must collectively prepare to anticipate the impact of peak oil and climate change on energy. \u2026 [We must develop] global, continental, national, and regional public policies enabling democratic ecological planning; support struggles for the recovery of natural resources, common goods, and food sovereignty; and construct spaces for economic cooperation by developing a plural economy encompassing the private sector, a social and solidaristic economy, and public services. \u2026\n\n20. **The people\u2019s ecology rejects the professionalization of politics and its separation from struggles for social and ecological emancipation.** The popular classes do not need specialists in politics. They want to decide on the conditions of their lives, their work, and their environment from local to global. Politics is everyone\u2019s business. It is strong where social and environmental movements exist and express their force for transformation. It is weak where they do not. The people\u2019s ecology cannot be absorbed into a party, although it can become a component of various movements, parties, or fronts. The people\u2019s ecology is based on popular initiatives, self-managed struggles, the construction of democracy from below, and communal relations. So it returns to the origins of utopian and libertarian socialism, which initially wanted a collective, dynamic, and solidaristic response to liberal individualism, to the destruction of trades and rural communities, the dispossession of the popular classes by the industrial revolution, and their enslavement to the capitalist system.\n\n    The people\u2019s ecology finds the Charter of Amiens [of 1906] to be outdated. The formal separation between labor unions, associations, and parties was imposed by the industrial revolution. Similarly, the centralized organization of political parties dates to that time. Today social change movements must co-develop a political project and set it in motion. Doing politics differently presupposes practicing democracy thoroughly, abandoning internal competition for paid positions in favor of cooperation. However, faced with this historic task, the people\u2019s ecology movement cannot develop without a forum for political and theoretical elaboration, a capability to combine social forces engaged in the struggle, and the ability to articulate general perspectives and offer them as public policy. The movement that assumes this role must reject the outdated organizational pattern of a vanguard, with a program developed in isolation as a pre-determined model. It must therefore organize itself as an autonomous tendency within the ecology movement.\n\n    Our attempt to construct a political cooperative . . . was an advance over the party form, which has become obsolete in the 21st century. The separation between those who are said to be competent and those who are not, between political actors and union militants, belongs to the politics of the industrial revolution, where the popular classes were reduced to carrying out tasks. In fact, for the collective intelligence of the entire party and the society, it substituted the domination of one small group that imposed itself vertically on the rest. The conditions for that type of organization have collapsed. Inventing a party form suitable for the age of the network, of horizontality, is the task of the people\u2019s ecology.\n\n21. **The people\u2019s ecology supports the construction of communal democracy.** The people\u2019s ecology cannot build an alternative on the basis of elections alone. Without deep involvement of the population at all levels, democracy cannot exist today; otherwise it becomes a de facto census. The oligarchy has a stranglehold on the media, advertising, and polling, and it organizes democratic debate on its own terms. Citizens who want to reclaim politics must do it from the bottom, starting by federating transitional initiatives made by local communities engaging in social transformation and adopting values of the people\u2019s ecology: autonomy, equality, dignity, and mutual aid.\n\n    Political ecology seeks not to take power but to change society from below while simultaneously using the path of institutions, protest, and social experimentation. This strategy implies the exercise of power issuing from below, controlled by citizens mobilized in line with the federalist and self-management movement. It continues today in the social movements that want to liberate spaces rather than frontally attack state power. It does not exclude the question of the state from its thinking, but it considers that the transition will give rise to a system of self-government where citizens establish their own power in municipalities, regions, and companies. The political organization must help implement these self-government practices and without replacing them.\n\n    Communal democracy presupposes the construction of a federative republic at all levels. The federalist principle will not be applicable to the European continent or to the world system if it does not apply at the national, regional, and local levels.\n\n    Regarding political alliances, the people\u2019s ecology holds that the participation of majority coalitions for social transformation is the way for ecologists to become the cultural and political majority, but in countries where social liberalism has destroyed the basis for social democracy, leading to antisocial and anti ecological policies, participation in social liberal governments marginalizes political ecology and makes it an agent for green capitalism. We must participate in the construction of a social and ecological opposition, strengthening the presence of ecologists in all local, regional and European elections where autonomy can be built, and negotiate majority contracts in parliament, but refuse to participate in social-liberal governments that are the most effective instruments of capitalist modernity.\n\n\\-From the Social Ecology Cooperative Paris\n\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"21 Theses for A People's Ecology"}

The decolonization of the imaginary thus contributes to the rediscovery of the values and history of the disinherited, who are the exact opposite of the market society based on profit and competition exacerbated among individuals: they represent consociation, concern for others, the common ownership of land, the gift, mutual aid, cooperation, and civility.\n\n5. **he people\u2019s ecology was born in the nineteenth-century ecology of workers\u2019 associationism, agrarian populism, Luddism, civil disobedience, and libertarian geography.** Workers\u2019 associationism is the taproot of the social and solidaristic economy; Luddism is the root of the critique of industrialism and mechanization; agrarian populism emerged from struggles and wars of rural communities to defend their lifeways and existence against the development of another relation to earth and to commodification; civil disobedience originated in methods of noncooperation in struggles used from Thoreau to Gandhi and passing through the Landless of Brazil; the libertarian geography of Reclus and Kropotkin, countering sociobiology, developed the concept of mutual aid and cooperation.\n\n    The official history of ecology recounts its emergence as a passing of the baton from scientific ecologists to environmentalist and naturalist movements with bourgeois sensibilities toward nature. After 1968, a set of currents, born in the 1970s, from a cultural and generational movement nourished by various influences (feminism, Third World, pacifism and nonviolence, libertarian, socialist self-management) came together and gave birth to political ecology and the green parties. This story is false because it deliberately omits the ecology of the poor, which in the 19th and 20th centuries never ceased to fight capitalist modernity and the damage wrought by Progress.\n\n6. **The people\u2019s ecology, from its premises, is a rupture with the capitalist system with its limitless exploitation of resources, globalized trade, and capital accumulation.** Four key types of globalization underlie the ecological crisis.\n\n    \u2013 The first globalization was the triangular Atlantic trade system, based on human slavery, which resulted in the destruction of indigenous peoples and put in place extractivism, the grabbing of natural resources and raw materials.\n\n    \u2013 The second globalization, based on coal and steam energy, generated wage labor, forced labor, and productivism, that is, the religion of production based on the profits reaped by colonial empires. Meanwhile enclosures put an end to the common ownership of land and transformed millions of peasants into extensions of machines. The destruction of the peasant community coincided with the birth of the industrial proletariat.\n\n    \u2013 The third globalization, generated by oil exploitation, was that of Fordism and electricity, of consumerism and alienation.\n\n    \u2013 The fourth globalization, using nuclear power, peak oil and renewable energy, is contemporary with the planned obsolescence of products and of humanity itself. This era will lead either to barbarism and chaos or to a humanist Renaissance based on global citizenship and empathy. The current globalization threatens the very existence of humanity.\n\n    Reading these four globalizations through an ecological prism shows that capitalist modernity has always been based on the exploitation of the working classes and the destruction of their ecosystems. Those who are dominated have never ceased to contest the domination of human and of nature, as evidenced by Indian resistance, runaway slaves, slave revolts, riots and peasant wars, struggles for the rights and the health of workers, and nowadays the resistance to extractivism, huge dams, deforestation, and large unnecessary projects.\n\n    ###What Is the People\u2019s Ecology?\n\n7. **The people\u2019s ecology is neither mainstream nor neutral.** Ecology is intimately involved with social relations and confrontations from local to global. It places at the center of its thinking the conflict between the popular classes and the political and economic oligarchy, for the simple reason that all parts of humanity do not experience the ecological crisis in the same way. Inequalities in income, power, and cultural fluency, which lie at the root of ecological crises, ensure that some of us lack the capacity to protect ourselves from its effects. The aim of the people\u2019s ecology is to eradicate social inequalities, starting by decommodifying water, air, earth and in general all public goods (health, education, culture).\n\n    The financialization of the world is the highest stage of the fetishism of commodities, where the only standard is King Money and the level of material wealth is the index of calculating happiness. The people\u2019s ecology, against the dictatorship of the economic, has taken sides, and its preference for the poor finds strength in defending the living conditions of the poor, the disinherited, the dispossessed, the outcasts, and the unseen, to better fight ecological disaster. The crisis in climate, energy, and ecology will not be resolved within the mainstream but in the confrontation between the forces of the global economy and the people who are directly threatened by the crisis.\n\n8. **The people\u2019s ecology is a political and ideological current of the Green and international ecology movements.** It radically distinguishes itself from other tendencies:\n\n    \u2013 Environmentalism. This tendency reduces political ecology to nothing more than protection of the environment. But political ecology is a comprehensive and systemic approach to the relations among people, society, and nature. An environmentalism that only defends wildlife limits itself to one aspect of ecology and becomes NIMBY-type corporatism when it enters the political field.\n\n    \u2013 Deep ecology. This form of antihumanism emerged from conservationism, which has always excluded human beings from the ecosystem. Founded by the Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess, this school of thought is based on biocentrism, which reduces to antihumanism. Although the people\u2019s ecology criticizes anthropocentrism, it is not to be confused with an ecology that sets human beings outside nature\n\n    \u2013 Liberal ecology, sustainable development, green economics, and in general all those who want to place ecology in the service of greening capitalism. Liberal ecology, which reveres efficiency, is based on the commodification of ecology. It believes that Nature has a price and that its economy can be regulated to preserve Nature for future generations. Supporting a historic compromise with the capitalist system, which it considers invincible, and develops suitable mechanisms like carbon markets \u2026.\n\n    \u2013 The people\u2019s ecology. Pursuing the ecology of transformation, this radical ecology includes supporters of de-growth, social ecology, and eco-socialism. The ecology of transformation believes that capitalism cannot be reformed, and it sets about creating the conditions for overcoming it, through social practices, concrete struggles, and the elaboration of a political project that takes recourse neither to the laws of the market nor to the state as the supreme savior.\n\n9. **The people\u2019s ecology is not eco-socialism.** It is not a copy-and-paste of the theses of scientific socialism and ecology. It is not a successor of productivist socialism but exists as an alternative to it. So-called \u201cscientific\u201d socialism is based on belief that the development of productive forces desired and supported by the bourgeoisie has created the conditions for its own overthrow by the very class it helped form, the modern industrial proletariat.\n\n    This concept was reinforced by the ideology of Progress, the deification of science and technology, the development of technology at all costs regardless of its consequences, the disproportionate importance given to the role of the nation-state, and the negation of community identities. But capitalism went on to destroy peasant communities, the lifeways of artisans and tradespeople, and it enlisted millions of workers in an industrial army with no reference beyond the industrial and productivist revolution itself. In the colonies, it attacked ancestral civilizations based on the lands of the people it claimed to assimilate and civilize. . . .\n\n    The critique of technology is another difference between eco-socialism and the people\u2019s ecology. Marxism believes that technology is a neutral instrument that can and must be put at the service of the working class, that technology is a decisive factor for social transformation and progress. By contrast, the people\u2019s ecology considers that technology is becoming ever more autonomous and is endangering the earth and humankind. Nonetheless, eco-socialism is the intellectual tendency closest to the people\u2019s ecology. The overlaps are numerous, and they can work together as part of the same international network.\n\n10. **The people\u2019s ecology is not the same as de-growth.** Even if the principles of de-growth are applied to the entire world system, the people\u2019s ecology still finds it necessary to guarantee food, education, and health for the popular classes. Fair cultivation in these areas requires a model of eco-development based on social and ecological justice. In the South, in the poorest countries, but also in emerging and Western countries, this can translate into a policy of reparation (such as compensation for financial or ecological debt). The popular classes who have been excluded from the system may then get a boost through the growth of consumption and production in some areas. If decline in the ecological footprint is to be an absolute rule, it must not come at the expense of the popular classes. De-growth cannot mean recession. On the contrary, it must replace the quantitative growth of capitalism and its logic of accumulation with the logic of qualitative growth, which implies significant quantitative de-growth primarily in the dominant capitalist countries.\n\n11. **The people\u2019s ecology is an ecology of liberation.** It is an ecology of the poor in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Its founding figures are Chico Mendes, Vandana Shiva, and Ken Saro-Wiwa. It holds that the connections between Mother Earth and the poor prohibit the commodification of water, air, and earth. By liberating themselves, the poor liberate all of humanity and preserve the planet and all its components. The ecology of liberation has as a foundational principle that the earth is not to be owned.\n\n    The ecology of liberation is an ecology of survival. It demands access to rights as defined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including the rights to housing, health, and food.\n\n    The ecology of liberation has a spiritual dimension characterized by a rapprochement between Christian liberation theology and the idea of Mother Earth that is found in the peasant communities in the Andean highlands and elsewhere.\n\n12. **The people\u2019s ecology is an ecology of environmental justice.** This movement, born in the United States in the 1980s, struggles against ecological racism. The ecological crisis does not have the same impact in poor neighborhoods as it does in wealthier ones. Environmental inequalities merge with social and ethnic inequalities to structure a territorial and ethnic-social discrimination. The people\u2019s ecology is anti-discriminatory. In this sense it has a very strong relationship with the social ecology theorized by the libertarian ecological activist Murray Bookchin.\n\n13. **The people\u2019s ecology is an ecology of the commons.** The commons originated as an achievement of the farming community especially in the fight against \u201cenclosures,\u201d and it is at stake in social and ecological struggles today. Whether it opposes the patenting of life, land grabs, the appropriation of cyberspace, the privatization of culture, or control over natural resources and raw materials, the struggle for the commons is basic to the new ecological struggle of the peoples. The commons is reclaiming common goods, collective intelligence, and ancestral skills such as practical information that resists privatization.\n\n14. **The people\u2019s ecology is a transnational and alter-globalizing ecology.** It rests on organized social forces such as the peasant movement (La Via Campesina), movements against deforestation and large dams, the movement for Climate Justice, the movement against the imposition of useless large projects, the movements of indigenous peoples for survival, the movement for free software, and eco-unionism. It participates in the alter-globalization movement at social forums.\n\n15. **The people\u2019s ecology has affinities with eco-unionism.** Workers\u2019 struggles against against social and environmental injustices are part of the people\u2019s ecology. Struggles for occupational health against asbestos, lead poisoning, and toxic products are an essential dimension. The people\u2019s ecology, like eco-unionism, advocates self-management. It advocates the direct management of companies on a federalist and decentralized model but also user-citizen control over production and the environment.\n\n16. **The people\u2019s ecology is eco-feminist.** The patriarchal capitalist system has oppressed and exploited women as it has land. Eco-feminism holds that protecting of the integrity of life in all its forms against patriarchal domination is a unified fight. Industrialism has turned not only nature but the female body into merchandise. The domination of nature by humans is intrinsically linked to the domination of women by men. Humans cannot establish a new relation with nature without changing human relationships between women and men. Eco-feminism advocates principles such as reciprocity, mutual aid, solidarity, sharing, trust, care for others, respect for the individual, and responsibility with respect to all ecosystems.\n\n17. **The people\u2019s ecology is cosmopolitan.** The preservation of human diversity is an essential element in the struggle for the defense of the planet. Six thousand peoples compose the planet, and the preservation of their languages, cultures, and identities is a key feature of the ecological struggle. Financial globalization tries to standardize culture by imposing a standardized language and cultural production. The war of civilizations advocated by the American neoconservatives in the 1990s gave rise to a globalized racism against people who reject the new world order. There is no national ecology. The people\u2019s ecology is borderless and fights for global citizenship. Cosmopolitanism is the humanism of the twenty-first century.\n\n    ###The Strategy of the People\u2019s Ecology\n\n18. **The people\u2019s ecology fights for the creation of a new historic bloc: the coalition for the commons.** The struggle cannot depend on the cultured urban middle classes but must bring together those who represent the modern proletariat: intellectual workers, the precariat, parts of the industrial working class, petty officials, and peasant-workers. The people\u2019s ecology\u2019s allies in this new historical bloc are all the movements that fight for access to rights for everyone and for ecological democracy. This bloc is a coalition for the commons, among those who are fighting for physical common goods (water, earth, air) and so for the survival of humanity and those who fight for intangible common goods (information, culture, cyberspace) against the new enclosures. This bloc is a numerical majority. The great mass of working people share this desire for a revolution for the commons and for access.\n\n19. **The people\u2019s ecology seeks an ecological transition based on an alternative model of development that takes into account human needs and the limitations of the planet.** It rethinks the social utility of production, ways of consuming, the purpose of our products, and how they are produced. It advocates the relocalization of economic activity and the conversion of useless or predatory activities, and the redistribution of wealth and work. In the fight against productivist agriculture, it highlights agro-ecology and respects the peasantry\u2019s ancestral knowledge. The transitional program includes:\n\n    \u2013 an energy and industrial policy with a notable tightening of energy conservation, an end to nuclear power, the nonexploitation of unconventional sources of fossil fuels, and the use of local renewable energy\n\n    \u2013 the relocalization of the economy to avoid forced displacements and to restore control and fair resource sharing at the local level. It supports an informal popular economy and a new post-capitalist economy solidarity economy. . . .\n\n    To develop society\u2019s resilience to the ecological crisis, we must collectively prepare to anticipate the impact of peak oil and climate change on energy. \u2026 [We must develop] global, continental, national, and regional public policies enabling democratic ecological planning; support struggles for the recovery of natural resources, common goods, and food sovereignty; and construct spaces for economic cooperation by developing a plural economy encompassing the private sector, a social and solidaristic economy, and public services. \u2026\n\n20. **The people\u2019s ecology rejects the professionalization of politics and its separation from struggles for social and ecological emancipation.** The popular classes do not need specialists in politics. They want to decide on the conditions of their lives, their work, and their environment from local to global. Politics is everyone\u2019s business. It is strong where social and environmental movements exist and express their force for transformation. It is weak where they do not. The people\u2019s ecology cannot be absorbed into a party, although it can become a component of various movements, parties, or fronts. The people\u2019s ecology is based on popular initiatives, self-managed struggles, the construction of democracy from below, and communal relations. So it returns to the origins of utopian and libertarian socialism, which initially wanted a collective, dynamic, and solidaristic response to liberal individualism, to the destruction of trades and rural communities, the dispossession of the popular classes by the industrial revolution, and their enslavement to the capitalist system.\n\n    The people\u2019s ecology finds the Charter of Amiens [of 1906] to be outdated. The formal separation between labor unions, associations, and parties was imposed by the industrial revolution. Similarly, the centralized organization of political parties dates to that time. Today social change movements must co-develop a political project and set it in motion. Doing politics differently presupposes practicing democracy thoroughly, abandoning internal competition for paid positions in favor of cooperation. However, faced with this historic task, the people\u2019s ecology movement cannot develop without a forum for political and theoretical elaboration, a capability to combine social forces engaged in the struggle, and the ability to articulate general perspectives and offer them as public policy. The movement that assumes this role must reject the outdated organizational pattern of a vanguard, with a program developed in isolation as a pre-determined model. It must therefore organize itself as an autonomous tendency within the ecology movement.\n\n    Our attempt to construct a political cooperative . . . was an advance over the party form, which has become obsolete in the 21st century. The separation between those who are said to be competent and those who are not, between political actors and union militants, belongs to the politics of the industrial revolution, where the popular classes were reduced to carrying out tasks. In fact, for the collective intelligence of the entire party and the society, it substituted the domination of one small group that imposed itself vertically on the rest. The conditions for that type of organization have collapsed. Inventing a party form suitable for the age of the network, of horizontality, is the task of the people\u2019s ecology.\n\n21. **The people\u2019s ecology supports the construction of communal democracy.** The people\u2019s ecology cannot build an alternative on the basis of elections alone. Without deep involvement of the population at all levels, democracy cannot exist today; otherwise it becomes a de facto census. The oligarchy has a stranglehold on the media, advertising, and polling, and it organizes democratic debate on its own terms. Citizens who want to reclaim politics must do it from the bottom, starting by federating transitional initiatives made by local communities engaging in social transformation and adopting values of the people\u2019s ecology: autonomy, equality, dignity, and mutual aid.\n\n    Political ecology seeks not to take power but to change society from below while simultaneously using the path of institutions, protest, and social experimentation. This strategy implies the exercise of power issuing from below, controlled by citizens mobilized in line with the federalist and self-management movement. It continues today in the social movements that want to liberate spaces rather than frontally attack state power. It does not exclude the question of the state from its thinking, but it considers that the transition will give rise to a system of self-government where citizens establish their own power in municipalities, regions, and companies. The political organization must help implement these self-government practices and without replacing them.\n\n    Communal democracy presupposes the construction of a federative republic at all levels. The federalist principle will not be applicable to the European continent or to the world system if it does not apply at the national, regional, and local levels.\n\n    Regarding political alliances, the people\u2019s ecology holds that the participation of majority coalitions for social transformation is the way for ecologists to become the cultural and political majority, but in countries where social liberalism has destroyed the basis for social democracy, leading to antisocial and anti ecological policies, participation in social liberal governments marginalizes political ecology and makes it an agent for green capitalism. We must participate in the construction of a social and ecological opposition, strengthening the presence of ecologists in all local, regional and European elections where autonomy can be built, and negotiate majority contracts in parliament, but refuse to participate in social-liberal governments that are the most effective instruments of capitalist modernity.\n\n\\-From the Social Ecology Cooperative Paris\n\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"21 Theses for A People's Ecology""num_comments":0,"score":3,"selftext":"","subreddit":"environment","title":"21 Theses for A People's Ecology"}

As if to say ''Well technically whiteness is okay, but in the context of Nazism it's not...?''\n\n\n\nAsk yourself this, what is whiteness? What is it to be white? \n\n\nSome might say it is a genetic or biological thing. If this statement is assumed, then I must ask this: \n\n\nHow come Irish and Italian people were not considered white a century ago? How come Scandinavians were considered laplanders, a sort of Inuit/Eskimo mix, and were not seen as white until the holocaust happened?\n\n\n\nHow come plenty of Greek, Spaniards and even Bulgarians and Balkan people have brown skin far more comparable to Middle Easterners or Latinos? And yet they are seen as white? \n\n\n\nPlenty of Asian people certainly have pale complexions that could meet the criteria of whiteness, and yet they are Asians. \n\n\nMy wife is non-white, and her skin is very pale. Yet one of my best friends is white, and his skin is surprisingly husky due to his Italian relatives. So if whiteness was a matter of race and skin colour, then even on that basis it could not be racial. Because you have non-white people with white complexion, and white people with non-white complexion. \n\n\nIn fact, in Rwanda they even had White Black people. The Belgians divided people into two distinct groups. The Hutus and the Tutsis. The Tutsis were people with narrow noses, pronounced cheekbones, brighter skin complexion, green eyes rather than brown eyes, etc. They were given managerial jobs, low level government authority, and large levels of white privilege. But they were still Black Africans. The Belgians had simply declared them white by granting them privilege. \n\n\nThe Hutu people were people who had what were considered more African traits, and they did menial and service jobs. \n\n\nSo right there you have Black White people, and it wasn't okay for them to be White either. It created a terrible society in which people lived in virtual caste systems and had no freedom. \n\n\n\nSo whitness is not biological. It fluctuates with politics, and culture. It fluctuates with war and colonial politics. In short, it fluctuates with nationalism and privilege. \n\n\n\nWhiteness is simply to be on the better end of racism. Mind you, hierarchies are inter-sectional, and so a white person's whiteness might be cancelled out by poverty, or disability, or gender, or all three, or something else for that matter. But if you have a racist society that ascribes to the concept of whiteness, then if two people in identical situations, with the sole distinction being that one is white and one is coloured, then society will reward the white person more. \n\n\n\nAnd that's why it's pretty fucking easy to argue against it being okay to be white. \n\n\nI'm white. Not biologically, I have mixed ethnicity. But I look white and grew up in what is regarded a white country. I get special treatment thanks to this. So when I say I don't want to be white, then that does not mean I am looking to change my colour, or my genetic traits. \n\n\nIt simply means that I want to provide for myself, and be a dignified adult. That I don't need an entire fucking hemisphere working around the clock for peanuts just to sustain me. That, I don't want pigs in the streets being uniformed thugs against people I care about. \n\nThat I don't want whiteness, an entirely political concept, to justify violence and genocidal policies against non-white peoples of the world. Who may very well become white some day, just like how I could stop being white some day. Because it's not biological, it's just some arbitrary bullshit derived from pseudoscience in the 1700's. \n\n\n\nSo it doesn't matter if your skin is dark, or bright. But you have no right what so ever to proclaim whiteness over other ethnicities. ","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Why it's not okay to be white."}

Before I get started, put down your copy of The Ego and Its Own - this is not about the \"rights\" of freedom of speech, but rather, about what \"speech\" fundamentally *is*.\n\nLiberals, \"centrists\", and Conservatives in the United States are all united by a pretty big thing: dedication to the US's First Amendment. And why shouldn't they be? It's a well-meaning amendment in the Bill of Rights. It's worded in a way that can be applied in most societies, though I would personally argue that a few words should be swapped out, such as \"Speech\" for \"Expression\", and so on and so forth, to prevent any problematic misunderstandings. The biggest problem with the First Amendment isn't how it's written or the series of documents it's written on, though - it's how it's interpreted.\n\nWhen a mainstream political ideology in the US speaks of the \"Freedom of Speech\", there's a huge rift between progressives and regressives on what the meaning is. Regressives often take it to mean literal verbal speech - spoken words - though they will vehemently deny this while petitioning the government to ban, say, pro-Communist literature, or ISIS recruitment propaganda. Progressives take it to mean any expression that a person might have, be it verbal, written, painted, acted, whatever. I personally lean towards the more Progressive conception of what \"speech\" means in this scenario.\n\nIn my mind, \"Speech\" as written in the First Amendment either does not or, more realistically, should not only refer to verbally spoken words. It should cover every possible expression of any idea and any emotion: including any possible reaction to those expressions, be they outrage, silence, or a fist in the face.\n\nThe modern right-wing champions the \"Freedom of Speech\" and claims that \"censorship\" means doing anything to discourage any viewpoint from spreading like wildfire. This is, of course, hypocritical virtue signaling, because the vast majority of those right-wingers will have an unfavorable response if anyone else were to come up to them and start spouting off about how they fucked their mother, about how they're lazy do-nothing leeches, how their favorite politician is a proven pedophile, whatever. They take offense just like any other human does. Where the hypocritical virtue signaling comes in is when they respond to any expression in a negative way. Expressing disgust at what they view as a distasteful piece of artwork. Expressing anger verbally by shouting. Going behind the person's back to get them fired and/or ostracized by their friends, family, and community. These responses are all expressions of ideas and emotions. And they will vehemently defend their statements that they'll punch anyone in the face for harassing them, their families, and their friends. But at the same time, they seem to genuinely believe that somehow this is different from when anybody *else* does the same thing and reacts to *their* speech. I can already hear them screaming, \"That's different!\", and \"But I'm right!\", and so on and so forth. What it is is ideologically inconsistent. It's a manifestation of claiming to have one set of values while acting in opposition to those values, because simply saying that one supports the same values as their community claims they support is a good way of gaining social recognition as a \"good person\". It's personally validating. And it's ridiculous.\n\nAnarchists and other assorted leftists ridicule this with the pejorative phrase \"muh freeze peach\", which unfortunately gives the impression that progressive ideologies are directly opposed to the freedom of speech. Perhaps these sarcastic phrases aren't the best strategically, but god damn does it feel good to use them. The point that, from my view, we're trying to make is that it's hypocritical to *say* one believes in the \"freedom of speech\" but act as though one doesn't also support the extension of the \"freedom of speech\": the freedom to respond.\n\nArtwork, news articles, music, interpretive dance, a street brawl - it's all the same in that it's an expression of an idea or an emotion. It's the same if a person gets upset over someone insulting their favorite politician, and if a community throws someone out on their ass for directly insulting other hard-working community members like immigrants or minorities. Responses to speech are speech in and of themselves.\n\nOf course, the government tends to be above all that nonsense, right? I mean, if it weren't, then why would people be so vehemently in support of banning books at public county school systems, regulating radio wave usage, regulating political parties, regulating referendums, regulating who can and can't speak at universities, etc.? I'll let y'all think about that one yourselves, but given that this is /r/anarchism, you're probably already at the same conclusion that I'm at over it unless you've wandered in from somewhere else.\n\nEdit: Downvoted in under one minute, new record!

From one hell to another, what difference? In the howling of your legions, in the holy milk of the mothers of Spain, in the milk and the bosoms trampled along the roads, there is one more village, one more silence, a broken door. Here you are. Wretched eyelid, dung of sinister sepulchral hens, heavy sputum, figure of treason that blood will not erase. Who, who are you, oh miserable leaf of salt, oh dog of the earth, oh ill-born pallor of shadow?\n\nThe flame retreats without ash, the salty thirst of hell, the circles of grief turn pale. Cursed one, may only humans pursue you, within the absolute fire of things may you not be consumed, not be lost in the scale of time, may you not be pierced by the burning glass or the fierce foam. Alone, alone, for the tears all gathered, for an eternity of dead hands\n\nand rotted eyes, alone in a cave of your hell, eating silent pus and blood through a cursed and lonely eternity. You do not deserve to sleep even though it be with your eyes fastened with pins: you have to be awake, General, eternally awake among the putrefaction of the new mothers, machine-gunned in the autumn.

Smiling. There are smiles now demolished by blood that wait with scattered exterminated teeth and masks of muddled matter, hollow faces of perpetual gunpowder, and the nameless\n\nghosts, the dark hidden ones, those who never left their beds of rubble. They all wait for you to spend the night. They fill the corridors like decayed seaweed. They are ours, they were our flesh, our health, our bustling peace, our ocean of air and lungs. Through them the dry earth flowered. Now, beyond the earth,\n\nturned into destroyed substance, murdered matter, dead flour, they await you in your hell. Since acute terror or sorrow waste away, neither terror nor sorrow awaits you. May you be alone and accursed, alone and awake among all the dead, and let blood fall upon you like rain, and let a dying river of severed eyes slide and flow over you staring at you endlessly.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"A poem by Pablo Neruda- General Franco in Hell"}

{"author":"Thumblesteen","created_utc":1510781299,"num_comments":35,"score":5,"selftext":"Hello everyone. Now, first off, I might be a bit critical here at first but just see where I'm going with this. \n\n\nI've spoken to trans comrades, seen how the Nazis exploit Otherkin to dehumanise trans people and justify violence against them. Whether people in the Otherkin group are problematic themselves or not, we still see some issues. \n\n\nSome people are appropriating the word ''dysphoria'' for instance, and others seem to think they're basically like trans people. \n\n\n\nSo this can go a lot of directions, is my point. We all saw what happened to the furries. Nazis and reactionaries belittled them for ages, made them feel alienated, and then, amazingly enough, exploited that vulnerability to be friends with some of them in the most astounding display of Stockholm syndrome I've ever witnessed. \n\n\nNow I've snooped around and seen what the Otherkin are about, and, I'm not a bully. So call yourself a dragon or a wolf, I really don't mind. It does nothing to affect my life. Go right ahead. If you want me to call you a dragon or a wolf, that's fine too. I don't see the issue here. _BUT_ I fear they might try to appropriate trans peoples' platforms and discussions, that they might become targets for alt-right entryism, that they might suffer a lot of issues that we've seen happen to other communities. \n\n\n\nNow I know for a fact there's members in the far left who are part of this community, and I also know that the reason the alt-right have a way of doing so much damage is because they make these posts and try to organise people.\n\n\nSo I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that we should probably try and initiate some kind of dialogue with these people. To try and get them on our side, and develop their cultural values constructively alongside those of trans people in a way that doesn't harm anyone. \n\n\nThat and if the left legitimises them, then the fash can't really exploit them. They're only strange or unfamiliar if they're a minority, or obscure, or not understood. \n\n\n\nSo, /r/otherkin/. Click it. Talk to these people. Get to them before the Nazis do. Just wanted to like shed a light on that. We can get some solid comrades out of this, gain prominence among them, and turn more people to the left in the future. These people are alienated, and shat on by everyone. First people to be friends with them is gonna leave a really good impression. \n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia was the first nation to officially recognise US independence. Look at how that paid off for them down the line. Might be a weird comparison but you know I'm on to something. \n\n\n\nI'd do it myself, but I'm not super good at it given my autism and all. I'm better and researching things and finding ripe opportunities for entryism and reaching out to people. \n\n\n\n\nHope you all have a good day now.\n\n\nAnd remember: Everyone were dicks to the juggalos except for us and now look at them.

First id like to apologize if there is any misunderstanding in my post as english isnt my native language, but hopefully if there is any problem im sure ill be able to clarify my concerns in the comments. Second, im sorry if this isnt the place to post this kind of things, but while i have some general ideas as to how to start a chapter, but i still have a lot of questions and i was hoping maybe some of you could give me some hint or general tips.\n\nSo for now ive tried to contact the people of the last chapter. Ive only been able to reach one and he told me that the other members gave up (due to a fraudulent landlord) about a year ago and that they didnt had the energy to continu the fight ( i dont blame them, i red an article in the newspaper about the incident, it was a shit show...) And the one ive contacted told me he have other fights to do on his own in his personal life. So here i am, pretty much alone. For the record i barely have time to go out with my friends at the moment, recently i had a day off, my first in three weeks as i work multiple jobs and go to school. So i defenetly need people to get FNB back on the map in my City.\n\nSo here is the thing. I've thought about making pamphlets and distribute them in militant circles at some universities and colleges, but what do i put on the pamplhet? I need a kitchen, food storage, food, transportation, someone who can drive as i dont have a driver's licence, kitchen dishes (pot and stuff), exterior kitchen equipment (where im from, temp\u00e9ratures can go below 30 degrees celsius with the wind and often from december to march are between minus 10 and minus 20). Also do i use reusable plates and ustensil? If yes then ill need those too...\n\nAs for food, i get that it is vegan, but to me, the first goal is to feed the hungry, so if people donate meat, should i just refuse the donation for the sake of purity? At this point, i mean, if it ends up in a garbage its just wasted energy so why not use it? Also does it have to be a strict form of vegan, like no animal product at all (like cow milk and cream and stuff) or is it relaxed? For the record, im a cook, but i honestly dont know much about vegan food, ive already printed the FNB book wich contains recipees tho, but if anyone have some special tips that makes the food more tasteful, ill take them.\n\nAs for GMOs, can i use them? To my understanding its not the GMOs in itself the problem, but it is the corporate use of it, tho if im wrong could someone link me a study about their ecological and health negative impacts?\n\n\nIm gonna say this as i know i will get people who recommand this, so ill say what i think about it. Ill only ask help from the church as a last resort. The catholic church push antiabortion, anti trans, homophobia, in some case islamophobia, they never aknowledged and or tried to repair the monstruous damages that they inflicted on the indigenous people of my country, they target people  who are struggling with addiction to convert them (wich expose them to anti abortion, homophobia and transphobia agenda),... It just doesnt feel right at all with me.\n\n\nAlso id like you opinions on creating ties with gouvernmental welfare projects. Like im defenetly not qualified to help someone who is about to commit suicide, so should it be ok for the FNB chapter to work with suicide hot lines, addiction center for drugs or gamble addicts, women safe house for women in distress,... ? To me it seems like a clear YES but id like your two cents on this.\n\n\nFinaly, id really like to do at least one food distribution before new years eve, a time that can be cold as fuck and people are with their family enjoying good time, but a lot of unlucky people get forgotten. Thanks for any of your tips, suggestions, support, now let get this started and help people!","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"I need your help to organize FNB chapter in my City!"}

Became active in one, even though I'm an anarchist (still acting as one btw, I joined the IWW too). I don't care what MLs say, because what I see is nothing but bullshit. You have to pay attention and invest an enormous amount of energy just to make sure they don't abuse their position of power that they were handed even though it's either a completely unnecessary one or their work could be handled better by people themselves, without formal power. Ranging from sheer incompetence combined with nepotism to active power-grabbing, you got everything on the menu. \n\nIt gets exhausting so very fast. Nothing gets done, ever, and your whole energy has to be invested into the situation, because, and that is the most tragic element, whoever directs their energy outwards, helps the organization but loses within the internal powerplays and becomes a pawn. Happens even to those few that actually manage to get elected because they care for the people. Get paraded as great examples, but have little to say. Our group fielded a candidate last elections that got 10 times the personal votes than one of the most powerful people within the party. Guess who's powerful and who isn't?\n\nAnd in the end, few people vote for you and you search for one or two excuses, like \"Welp, the people voted for the SocDems to stop the fascists, can't change that\" or start bullshit like \"our party name is the problem. Let's change it\"... onto the next election, and the next \"welp, we've tried\". \n\nOh, did I mention how \"solidarity\" is always a code-word for intra-organizational power struggles? When the tiny Trotskyite party calls for a \"united left\", it *has* to be with them setting the agenda. Trotskyite organizations overall just try to infiltrate you and dictate you their course whenever they want to \"cooperate\". And many non-Trotskyite organizations aren't any better. \n\nI mean, fuck, the IWW is active just in one city here with 30 people, about 10 of them really somewhat involved, and they accomplish more in a month than the whole \"\"communist\"\" movement (outside of one region which has seceded from the overall bullshit, surprisingly they're powerful there. And no-one cares to imitate them, only to parade them.) with thousands of pretty active members does *in a year*. The communists can barely field a fucking readable website that doesn't look like it's from 1999. And people get paid full-time for that bs.\n\nAnd yes, they got money from back when they were a Soviet proxy, and quite a bit of money from the state because they're still the best option for a communist in any election. And no, the IWW is still better at doing what it does. It's pathetic, it's exhausting, it's an institutionalized organization with hierarchical structures. The Anarchists get people to do stuff they are excited by, they do get stuff done and get into the news, have structures that actually help people, even though they're a bit clique-ish in the capital.  \n\nAnd I don't care if people know who this is and what I'm talking about and if it hurts me \"politically\". I became a part of it because there are fundings and it can reach many people, hell, a nobel prize winner is part of the party and leaders of the party get invited by the fucking pope to his residency, we've got great and powerful international contacts, nationwide recognition and are important (in a positive way) in the history books kids get taught in school, altogether completely beyond the level a minor party like this one should be at. \n\nThis is the best machine to help many people not suffer too much before a revolution occurs, better than anything one can start up. And those fucking morons are wasting it all for their petite-bourgeoise power plays within the sand box, until none of it is left. Fuck them. They should know. They should know how many people suffer because they're too in love with themselves and their egos to *at least let the members do what they're capable of*, if nothing else. \n\nSo, rant over.

{"author":"cervance","created_utc":1511133072,"num_comments":2,"score":53,"selftext":"Hey all, I'd like to do a little write-up on the three groups that attended the Resist Marxism rally in Boston this weekend; their long-term strategies, ground-level tactics, and what to expect in the future.\n\nI'll start with Antifa. There were around 300~500 counter protestors total, from various left-wing groups, including Veterans for Peace, DSA, Refuse Fascism, and BLM. Others formed a Black Bloc about ~100 strong. Leadership was not in short supply, but BLM (or whatever group was led by the black women with the fight white supremacy banner) led the largest march, and had several speeches prepared to drown out the garbage coming from the bandstand. Said group also had an educational workshop planned for after the rally, which is the second best praxis of the day behind Comrade Vermin Supreme crossing a police line and shouting back towards the counter protestors \"we have you surrounded!\" Due to a lack of numbers and tactical flexibility, only one entrance to the bandstand could be blocked, but block it we did, forcing the far-right to backtrack to another entrance the police prepared.\n\nNoticeably missing from the counter-protest were liberals. There were close to zero, and any that remained blended into the counter-protest and were assumed to be socialists (a veritable death sentence for a liberal!)\n\nThe far-right's strategy from earlier rallies remains unchanged, although their numbers haven't grown from the first rally in spring. Their plan is to forward basic conservative talking points and swell their numbers with frustrated Trump supporters, while slowly exposing them to fascist and white supremacist propaganda, and placing them in direct opposition to BLM and the socialist groups. The Oathkeepers, III%ers, American Vanguard, and Proud Boys are all militant groups looking to use these rallies to recruit fighters, though so far they seems to have had little success.\n\nOne particular group which appeared on the bandstand for the second rally, but did not give a speech this time, was the Shiva4Senate campaign. The fascists let him on the bandstand during the second rally, and used his speech (a combination of anti-Monsanto and BLM talking points) as proof that they were not white supremacists. I had the pleasure(?) of meeting Shiva and asking him a few questions, and he told me he was not going up on the bandstand with the fascists again, and then lectured me that he's been fighting white supremacy for longer than I've been alive. I couldn't be bothered to lecture him in return on how he was used as a tool by the fascists to normalize their far-right talking points, or quiz him on whether he even knew BLM's platform. All things said, it's incredibly important to keep the fascists separate from ordinary politics. Fascist rhetoric cannot be allowed to seep into the mainstream, anymore than it already has.\n\nThe far-right's ground tactics, despite relying heavily on police support, are not to be dismissed. They gathered at a spot outside the commons, and got into the park itself relatively unopposed, despite the fact that the counter protest had already massed inside the park as a group of at least 300. Better and faster information gathering and a quick response will be necessary to best use the number advantage of Antifa to shut down future rallies.\n\nWithout a doubt, the most effective force present in the commons was the Boston police. One tactic they employed was to mark each entrance with police vans. This was meant to prevent people from bringing weapons to the protest, and also to prevent vehicles from coming into the commons to attack counter protestors. This tactic, of using vehicles to safeguard against terrorism, is one which all anti-fascist organizers must adopt, wherever possible. Where applicable, those inside vehicles should also be armed, organized, disciplined, with clear leadership and communication with protestors on the ground. Using vehicles to protect protestors also has the upside of making it hard for cops to form a kettle. Finally, antifascist organizers should be prepared for the militant groups on the far-right to make more use of vehicles as well, as they develop their own ground tactics.\n\nSpeaking of bike cops, while they are nothing new, the Boston PD made excellent tactical use of them. Combined with barriers which were planted several hours before the rally began, bike cops were twice able to form an effective screen between the rally go-ers and counter protestors. The Boston PD distinguishes themselves from other departments by not standing down even in the face of 40k counter protestors at the second rally. While the Portland PD sought direct confrontation with the Black Bloc in order to secure an escape route for rally-goers earlier in the year, Boston PD prepared multiple exits from the bandstand with static barriers, and blocked the routes between entrances with mobile bike squads. The combination of static barricades and mobile forces is an important element in all ground battles.\n\nBoston PD also had a helicopter and special operations van present for the rally. \n\nEach confrontation between the police, the far-left, and the far-right is a small battle in a larger political war taking place in America right now. Such ground battles are integral to any political movement: left-wing or right-wing, reformist or revolutionary. Getting experience now is important to win larger battles which will take place in the near future - general strikes, marches, occupations. Best of luck to every organizer looking to do their part in the struggle.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"The Police Won the Third Boston Far-Right Rally"}

It is also called the Great Dying. Although those who write about environmental change like to add notes of false personalization around this point \u2014 \u201cMy children will be x years old when catastrophe y happens\u201d \u2014 there is really no good way of acclimating the mind to facts of this magnitude.\n\nHowever, the cause of the disaster that, by all indications, we are already living through should be clearer. It is not the result of the failure of individuals to adopt the moralizing strictures of \u201cgreen\u201d consciousness, and it is a sign of just how far we have to go that some still believe reusable shopping bags and composting (perfectly fine in their own right) are ways out of this mess.\n\nIt is also not the deceit of specific immoral companies that is to blame: We like to pick out Volkswagen\u2019s diesel scandal, but it is only one of many carmakers that \u201cdeliberately exploit lax emissions tests.\u201d Nor does the onus fall on the foundering of Social Democratic reforms and international cooperation: Even before the United States backed out of the Paris Accord, we were well on our way to a 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit temperature rise by 2100, \u201ca temperature that at times in the past has meant no ice at either pole.\u201d\n\nThe real culprit of the climate crisis is not any particular form of consumption, production or regulation but rather the very way in which we globally produce, which is for profit rather than for sustainability. So long as this order is in place, the crisis will continue and, given its progressive nature, worsen. This is a hard fact to confront. But averting our eyes from a seemingly intractable problem does not make it any less a problem. It should be stated plainly: It\u2019s capitalism that is at fault.\n\nAs an increasing number of environmental groups are emphasizing, it\u2019s systemic change or bust. From a political standpoint, something interesting has occurred here: Climate change has made anticapitalist struggle, for the first time in history, a non-class-based issue.\n\nThere are many reasons we do not typically talk about climate change in this way. The wealthy are holding fast to theirs. Bought politicians and state violence are on their side. Eco-apartheid is not yet seen as full-on apartheid. Everyday people have plenty to keep up with, and they don\u2019t want to devote their precious time off work to often tedious political meetings. The inertia, it is sad to say, makes enough sense.\n\nPerhaps the most common belief about this problem is that it is caused by widespread ignorance \u2014 even outright \u201cstupidity\u201d \u2014 and that its solution lies in its opposite, intelligence. This belief is neatly expressed in progressive opposition to Donald Trump and his administration. Trump voters are often criticized for being unintelligent, for voting against their objective interests. Trump himself is regularly portrayed as unintelligent.\n\nThe basic idea is that if voters were intelligent, they would vote for an intelligent person who listened to intelligent people and all would be well. It is a staple of the liberal imaginary. Reflected here is the obtuse belief that the populist tide is simply mistaken, that it has gotten something wrong, which has the effect of veiling the real and justified dissatisfaction with the past 40 years of neoliberalism. Also reflected is the common view, which is not confined to one end of the political spectrum, that our biggest problems are essentially technical ones, and that the solution to them lies in the empowerment of intelligent people. The aura around Elon Musk is an extreme example of this kind of thinking.\n\nThe problem with the general view that intelligence will save us is that it involves pinning the failures of capitalist society on supposedly dumb people (them), who, so the logic goes, need to be replaced with supposedly smart ones (us). This is a spectacular delusion.\n\nWhen a company makes a decision that is destructive to the environment, for instance, it is not because there are bad or unintelligent people in charge: Directors typically have a fiduciary responsibility that makes the bottom line their only priority. They serve a function, and if they don\u2019t, others can take their place. If something goes wrong \u2014 which is to say, if something endangers profit making \u2014 they can serve as convenient scapegoats, but any stupid or dangerous decisions they make result from being personifications of capital.\n\nThe claim here is not that unintelligent people do not do unintelligent things, but rather that the overwhelming unintelligence involved in keeping the engines of production roaring when they are making the planet increasingly uninhabitable cannot be pinned on specific people. It is the system as a whole that is at issue, and every time we pick out bumbling morons to lament or fresh-faced geniuses to praise is a missed opportunity to see plainly the necessity of structural change.\n\nPut differently, the hope that we can empower intelligent people to positions where they can design the perfect set of regulations, or that we can rely on scientists to take the carbon out of the atmosphere and engineer sources of renewable energy, serves to cover over the simple fact that the work of saving the planet is political, not technical. We have a much better chance of making it past the 22nd century if environmental regulations are designed by a team of people with no formal education in a democratic socialist society than we do if they are made by a team of the most esteemed scientific luminaries in a capitalist society. The intelligence of the brightest people around is no match for the rampant stupidity of capitalism.\n\nOn the defensive for centuries, socialists have become quite adept at responding to objections from people for whom the basic functions of life seem difficult to reproduce without the motive power of capital. There are real issues here, issues that point to the opacity of sociability, as Bini Adamczak\u2019s recent book, \u201cCommunism for Kids,\u201d playfully explores. But the burden of justification should not fall on the shoulders of those putting forward an alternative. For anyone who has really thought about the climate crisis, it is capitalism, and not its transcendence, that is in need of justification. And don\u2019t be surprised, or fooled, when its defenders point to the tireless work of intelligent people.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"The Climate Crisis? It\u2019s Capitalism"}

Pennsylvania and Michigan were won by about 150 thousand votes only, and given how many communities in those states have been losing jobs in various sectors, I'm near certain that if we had more jobs in renewable energy in the states where coal is being replaced, he would not be president right now.\n\nYou can see similar trends around the world. Large parts of the far right is derived from people who also feel left out by a modernizing, automated, overlooked group. But instead of looking for more systematic problems, they look to a new leader or look to a problem that feels new like a new wage of refugees. \n\nThis problem is likely to just get worse if nothing is done, there are still about 50 thousand coal mining jobs left to automate and potentially even more in natural gas depending on the price of the latter compared with renewable energy. Automation in general is going to kill millions of jobs by the time Trump is up for reelction and his counterparts around the world such as Czechia and Hungary, even though a true cooperative or even commune would lessen the working hours instead. \n\nThis is also a good time to try and improve the image of anarchism, if we can go and help them on a much larger scale than today, and show them what a cooperative is and show right wing groups working examples of them, then we can moderate the influence of the far right, and provide an even stronger opposition to the state.

Because when most of us think about\rpolice, we do not think of them as enforcing regulations. We think of them as fighting\rcrime, and when we think of \u201ccrime,\u201d the kind of crime we have in our minds is violent\rcrime. Even though, in fact, what police mostly do is exactly the opposite: they bring the\rthreat of force to bear on situations that would otherwise have nothing to do with it. I find\rthis all the time in public discussions. When trying to come up with a hypothetical example\rof a situation in which police are likely to be involved, people will almost invariably think\rof some act of interpersonal violence: a mugging or assault. But even a moment\u2019s reflection\rshould make it clear that, when most real acts of physical assault do occur, even in major\rcities like Marseille or Montevideo or Minneapolis\u2014domestic violence, gang fights, drunken\rbrawls\u2014the police do not get involved. Police are only likely to be called in if someone\rdies, or is so seriously hurt they end up in the hospital. But this is because the moment an\rambulance is involved, there is also paperwork; if someone is treated in the hospital, there\rhas to be a cause of injury, the circumstances become relevant, police reports have to be\rfiled. And if someone dies there are all sorts of forms, up to and including municipal\rstatistics. So the only fights which police are sure to get involved in are those that generate\rsome kind of paperwork. The vast majority of muggings or burglaries aren\u2019t reported either,\runless there are insurance forms to be filled out, or lost documents that need to be replaced,\rand which can only be replaced if one files a proper police report. So most violent crime\rdoes not end up involving the police.\n\r\n&gt;On the other hand, try driving down the street of any one of those cities in a car without\rlicense plates. We all know what\u2019s going to happen. Uniformed officers armed with sticks,\rguns, and/or tasers will appear on the scene almost immediately, and if you simply refuse\rto comply with their instructions, violent force will, most definitely, be applied.\n\n[Source](https://libcom.org/files/David_Graeber-The_Utopia_of_Rules_On_Technology_St.pdf)","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"All Cops Are Bureaucrats (Graeber)"}

That much is obvious. Antifa is just about the only tactic that's doing any work toward that end, and it is largely hated by the American public because fascists and liberal sympathizers in media have been able to dictate the narrative.\n\nWe do not have the massive propaganda machinery that the bourgeoisie are afforded, obviously, but I still believe that we have the potential to make worthwhile moves in that game.\n\nI think we have been focusing on the wrong things. Focusing on the optics of *antifa* is a Sisyphean struggle. We will always be up against an international propaganda machine that has the ability to spit out a thousand lies a day that people will believe without question. They have already branded antifa as something dangerous and mysterious and altogether dirty.\n\nAttempting to brand fascists is like trying to capture air with a butterfly net. Their ideology is purpose-built to be insubstantial and contradictory.\n\nThere's another group, however, that we were all imagining as a part of the audience for this propaganda war. Most of us didn't consider the liberals, radical centrists, conservatives -whatever you want to call them- who defend giving fascism a platform, believe we should consider their views, believe that they're nonviolent and that antifa is attacking them, etc. as anything other than either fascists or idiots not worth talking to.\n\nI think they're the potential weak point, and I think branding those who defend fascism's \"right\" to do *anything* as pro-fascist -or profa- could force an early birth of fascism, thus making it far easier to kill than if it had a full gestation period. \n\nLoaded into a meme, it would look something like: *There is no anti-antifa; there is only antifa and profa.*\n\nThink about it: If we got a similar meme off the ground, and pushed it into the mainstream as the fascists do with their meme-propaganda, it would force a reaction. Being labeled pro-fascist, as a group, isn't something radical centrists have had to deal with. It would further divide them into groups by reframing the argument. Currently, the argument is framed as being about speech. We need to reframe it as being about violence and totalitarianism. Framed in that way, the fascists won't have a free playground among reactionaries, and might be forced to coalesce into something substantial with what they have now.\n\nFascists are *counting on* this group eventually turning to fascism, and that is happening pretty rapidly. We can see fascist ideology trickling into otherwise conservative spaces. If we allow this to continue, in a few years we might have an unbeatable monster on our hands. Currently, their movement is small, and if it ossifies now, it can be crushed easily.\n\n**tl;dr** rebrand \"rational skeptics,\" radical centrists, lolbertarians, conservatives, whatever, as profa *if* they argue in favor of giving fascism space. Reframe the discussion from its current state as one of civil liberties for an unpopular group to what it really is: the promotion of fascism.\n\nFascism spreads like a plague once it gets going. An American fascism would be something beyond horrific, and given the state of American politics, an inevitable market crash, and the looming environmental crisis, it's apparent we're sitting on a bunch of dry tinder.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Killing modern fascism is a question of agitprop"}

We have already demonstrated how the cultural debate within the right is sterile and unmoving, and yet still mourning for that period between 1922 and 1943, known as the \u201cventennio\u201d. We see it in the words of those in support of the historical transformations of the \u201cItalian Social Movement\u201d, the foremost among these being Giorgia Meloni, who constantly tweets about how on the political right one tends to mourn the \u201cglories\u201d of fascism.\n\nOn Facebook and in conversation with people I often find myself reading and hearing myths about fascism, about how \u201cMussolini made Italy great\u201d, how \u201cwhen he was there, everyone had work\u201d, that \u201cwhen Mussolini was there the roads and trains were clean\u201d. This article is presented as a handbook on how to dissolve these false myths about fascism.\n\n## 1. When Mussolini was around, everyone had work!\n\n**FALSE**. Fascist Italy wasn\u2019t hit as severely by the great crisis of \u201929, even though it can be noted that Italian industrial production fell progressively until 1933, when it hit its lowest point compared to 1929 by about -25%. Again in 1933, unemployment peaked, affecting roughly 1 million people until it began to fall in 1938, the last year in which unemployment statistics were registered. Unemployment fell during the final years of fascism, but for an obvious reason: we were arming ourselves for the war and most industries had been adapted for military purposes. This can also be taken as the cause of the extremely high unemployment following Italy\u2019s liberation. It should be noted that fascism, rather than intervening to toughen the Italian economy through industrialization of the poorest regions and the development of these regions, preferred a politics of public works or extra-economic solutions (in 1934-1938, roughly 250,000 workers a day were employed in public works for an annual period of 267 days on average).\n\n## 2. When the Duce was there, no one went on strike!\n\n**And a great big thank you that no one would strike!** Starting in 1925 with the pact between the Confindustria and the Confederation of Fascist Corporations \u2013 known as the Palazzo Vidoni Pact \u2013 the fascist dictatorship placed a de facto prohibition on strikes. The agreement stated in fact that the Confindustria would only recognize the Fascist Confederation as a trade union and that the Confederation would only recognize the Confindustria as an industry representative. The regime was the only de facto union in Italy. It was later with the ultra-fascist laws (leggi fascistissime) that the government explicitly forbade striking, making it a **felony** (Codice Penale del 1930, cd \u2018Codice Rocco\u2019, art. 330-333 e 502 e seguenti)\n\n## 3. Thanks to Mussolini, women took a leading role in politics!\n\n**FALSE.** Even if in 1923 Mussolini participated in the 9th congress of the International Pro-Suffrage Federation, women never voted under the fascist dictatorship. In November 1925, the fascist regime approved a law that extended voting in administrative contexts to women, but just three months later, on 4th February 1926, **the local administrative votes were suppressed for all citizens**, giving this role to mayors who would nominate communal councillors, the mayors themselves being nominated by the government. Women voted for the first time on **2nd June 1946** for the decision between Italy being a monarchy or a republic, and for the Constituent Assembly.\n\n## 4. Without the Duce, you wouldn't have a pension!\n\n**FALSE.** The social security system was established in Italy in 1898 with the creation of the \u201cCassa Nazionale della Previdenza\u201d (National Providence Trust): It was a voluntary insurance, financed by contributions made by employees, and integrated by state intervention and by voluntary payments from employers. At that time, Mussolini was only 15 years old. The subscription to this institution wasn\u2019t made mandatory until 1919, during the Orlando government, when the institution changed its name to \u201cCassa Nazionale per le Assicurazioni Sociali\u201d (National Trust for Social Insurance). Mussolini founded the Italian Fasci at that time and they were not in government. In 1933 this institution became the \u201cIstituto Nazionale Fascista della Previdenza Sociale\u201d (National Fascist Institute for Social Providence). Its final name came in 1943, removing \u201cFascist\u201d from the name. The entire history of social security in Italy is verifiable on the INPS website. Social pensions were only first introduced in 1969. Mussolini had been dead for 24 years by that time. \n\n## 5. Mussolini eradicated the mafia!\n\n**FALSE.** The nomination of Cesare Mori as prefect of Palermo launched a vast campaign of anti-mafia propaganda from the government. Mussolini boasted about the actions of the prefect which had only affected the lowest levels of the mafia, as he himself wrote in his personal memoirs. He aimed, however, to strike a blow at the higher mafia. An emblematic example of the opposition of fascism is that of Alfredo Cucco, the leader of the Sicilian fascists. Mori was convinced that Cucco had obtained votes, support and donations from the mafia with which to found a newspaper: \u201cSicilia Nuova\u201d. Cucco was expelled from the National Fascist Party and the Fascio of Palermo was dissolved. This was the reaction of the upper levels of the mafia which acted directly on Mussolini\u2019s order to discredit Mori\u2019s work, which had a reputation of being too ambiguous or too violent. Mori quickly became a source of discomfort for fascism and its hierarchs (Grandi, Balbo and Farinacci never looked favourably on Mori) until he was relieved of duty as a senator.\n\n## 6. The Duce guaranteed medical care for all workers!\n\n**FALSE.** With the law n.138 of 11th January 1943, under the name of the \u201cFascist Mutual Entity \u2013 the institute for workers\u2019 medical aid\u201d, the first Cassa Mutua di Assistenza di Malattia (Mutual Trust for Medical Aid) was established. It only offered coverage to publicly employed workers. All others had no access to it.\n\nThe right to healthcare coverage for all began on 13th May 1947, with the establishment of the Istituto Nazionale per l\u2019Assicurazione Contro le Malattie (National Institute for Health Insurance), reformed in 1968 by law n.132 (known as the \u201cMariotti law\u201d), which covered all workers, including those employed by private enterprises. In 1978, with law n.833 of 27th December, the right to medical assistance, as well as compensation in case of illness, was established by the foundation of the Servizio Sanitario Nazionale (National Health Service), coming in effect on 1st July 1980 (known as the \u201chealth reform\u201d). This was obviously inspired by the British National Health Service (NHS).\n\n## 7. The Cassa Integrazione Guadagni (income assistance) was dreamt up and created by the Duce!\n\n**FALSE.** The first reclamation works started in 1924 with the establishment of the Consorzio di Bonifica di Piscinara (Reclamation Union of Piscinara) which began the canalisation of the Astura river, carrying out a project thought up by Leonardo Da Vinci, who was also interested in the hypothesis of reclamation. In fact, the first works were carried out by the Volsci (around the 6th century BC) which, with a drainage system based on a network of tunnels that are now famous and possibly unsurpassed, managed to ensure the discipline of the waters that made the area prosperous and fertile. Mussolini, thus, didn\u2019t start a damn thing.\n\n## 9. In the time of the Duce we were all richer!\n\n**FALSE.** Mussolini allowed industrialists and agrarians to expand their profits consistently, at the expense of the workers. In fact, he approved the restraint of their wages. In 1938, after 15 years of his work, the average Italian\u2019s economic situation had worsened, their income being roughly a third of the average Frenchman\u2019s. \n\n## 10. The Duce had grand roads built throughout Italy!\n\n**FALSE.** The infrastructure program for the construction of roads during the ventennio already began during the fifth government of Giovanni Giolitti (15th June 1920 \u2013 7th April 1921). Having established the impossibility of industrial development in the absence of solid infrastructure, industrial development showed itself to be necessary when compared with the other great powers that participated in the first world war. This \u201crevolution\u201d couldn\u2019t be effected by Giovanni Giolitti first, and afterwards by Bonomi\u2019s government that followed for the seven months he was in power, because of the boycotting and obstructionism carried out by the nascent Fascists, first by the generic popular movement (1919) and then in the form of a party in 1921 with the formation of the National Fascist Party. \n\n## 11. If the Duce wasn't there and you got sick, you wouldn't be able to collect your pay check!\n\n**FALSE.** With the law n.138 of 11th January 1943, the first Cassa Mutua di Assistenza di Malattia (Mutual Bank of Medical Aid) which offered minimal coverage only to publicly employed workers and not for others, was established. Workers\u2019 compensation for illness was given by the democratic republic, seeing as the Istituto Nazional per L\u2019Assicurazione Contro Le Malattie (National Institute for Health Insurance) was established by the head of state by legislative decree n.435 of 13th May 1947. The institute was reformed in 1968 to provide assistance to all workers, including those employed by private enterprises. In 1978, with the law n.883 or 23rd December 1978, workers\u2019 compensation for sickness, as well as the right to medical assistance was established with the creation of the Servizio Sanitario Nazionale (National Health Service).\n\n## 12. When the Duce was there, the populace was better off!\n\nThis too is an affirmation that can be dismissed. In fact, following the sanctions imposed on Italy in 1936 after the invasion of Ethiopia, the 18th of November of that year was declared as the \u201cDay of Faith\u201d, where Italians were invited, in theory, to donate all their gold to their country and to receive, in exchange, iron wedding rings inscribed with: \u201cORO ALLA PATRIA \u2013 18 NOV.XIV\u201d (\u201cGOLD TO THE NATION \u2013 18 NOV.XIV\u201d), which some pensioners still possess. This was said to be in theory because, despite the supposed voluntary invitation, whoever was found to possess gold, even in their home, was pursued as a traitor and an enemy of the nation by the Fascio Littorio teams, to be corrected (as they said at the time) by means of the club and castor oil. And to sustain the war in Abyssinia and Eritrea, and later alongside the Germans, autarky was imposed: all imported products were blocked, such as the bulk of the grain used to make pasta, which was substituted with \u201cItalic\u201d rice, or coffee which substituted with a \u201csurrogate\u201d made of toasted chicory, or tea, which was substituted with \u201ccolonial\u201d kakard\u00e8 (hibiscus). This measure had an overall worsening effect for much of the population.\n\nThere was also the seizure of agricultural produce from farmers, such as relatives of mine in the upper Forlivese. A high produce quota was imposed, only a small part of which was left to farmers for personal consumption or for sale in markets, while an extravagant portion was \u201cwithdrawn\u201d by local fascists \u201cfor the good of the nation\u201d, along with livestock. \n\nThey were years in which the rearing of pigs, which are cumbersome to raise and maintain and therefore easy to \u201cwithdraw\u201d, fell in favour of rabbits which were smaller, more discreet, and easier to hide. In the Santa Sofia di Romagna, the entire hillside of the village of Camposonaldo, an area impervious to exploration which would later become a partisan base, became an abusive breeding ground for rabbits to be eaten by farming families on Sundays and holidays despite the orders of the regime. \n\n##13. The Duce loved the Italian people!\n\nThe Duce did not like Italy *at all*. \u201cI would need a few thousand deaths before I sit myself down at a negotiating table\u201d said the duce on the 26th of May 1940 (source: L\u2019Italia nella seconda Guerra mondiale, Milano, Mondadori, 1946, p. 37) and so it was, as demonstrated in the disastrous \u201cRussian campaign\u201d, where, only to please Hitler with a wholly underequipped Italian military presence of 230,000 people, 114,520 were officially recorded as having died. Of course, this number doesn\u2019t include missing people i.e. those who weren\u2019t killed in battle but for whatever reason never returned home. UNIRR reports that an estimated 60,000 Italians died during their imprisonment in Russia. The Duce loved Italy so much that he introduced anti-Semitic racial laws in 1938 just to satisfy his Nazi ally, with an even flimsier excuse than Hitler, who believed that upholding those laws would\u2019ve helped the economy since the Jews played an important role in Germany\u2019s economy at the time, unlike in Italy, where Jews were mostly living in poverty. And the fascists, mostly during the Italian Social Republic (Sal\u00f2), actively participated in massacres in retaliation to partisan operations, as well as deporting Italian citizens to concentration camps. \n\nFurthermore, the fascist government in Italy was the founder and operator of the \u201clagers\u201d, a network of concentration and extermination camps similar to the German one. Official literature estimates that there were 259 prison camps, some being normal detention camps, others being sorting camps for those to be deported to Germany, and others still authentic extermination camps such as the Risiera di San Sabba in Trieste, where the devastation of the massacres was second only to the camps in Germany and Poland. The duce had much more than his \u201cfew thousand deaths\u201d. \n\n * 42 by firing squad in the ventennio by sentence of the Special Court\n * 28,000 years of combined prison sentences and political confinement\n * 80,000 Libyans uprooted from the Gebel with their families and condemned to suffer to their deaths in the Cyrenaican deserts\n * 700,000 Abyssinians barbarously killed in the Ethiopian project and in the ensuing \"Police operations\"\n * 250,000 Italian soldiers and officers dead or missing in the second world war\n * 640,000 Italian prisoners of war in German camps, 40,000 of whom died, the remaining 600,000 continuing to suffer for years shut behind barbed wire all over the world\n * 110,000 dead in the fight for the Liberation of Italy\n * Thousands of civilians buried alive in the rubble of city bombings\n * An innumerable amount of enemy soldiers and civilians that died at the hands of fascist aggression\n\nTo be added to the physical deaths are the psychological and moral ones inflicted in the 28,000 years of prison sentences and internal exile inflicted on political dissidents and enemies of the state. Let us not forget that as well as the deaths and persecutions, there is the great and unredeemable shame in the racial laws, or the \u201cgold for the nation\u201d project in which couples were invited (read: forced) to give their wedding rings to the state.\n\nIn sum, Mussolini loved Italy so much that he:\n\n * Instituted a dictatorship\n * Lowered all wages\n * Signed the Lateran Pacts\n * Brought the country to an economic collapse\n * Stole the liberties of Italian citizens\n * Wrote one of the most vile and infamous pages of Italian history by instituting the racial laws.\n\nTo conclude, he loved his people so much that he made them collapse into a civil war when he was ousted from office, by creating the Italian Social Republic. A country already in disarray after the 8th September armistice and sorely tried by war (conducted by him with disastrous results, to put it mildly) became even more torn between the so-called \u201cSal\u00f2 Republic\u201d and liberated Italy. \n\nOn a separate note, it isn\u2019t even true that \u201cwhen he was there, the trains ran on time\u201d, as is explained in  this article from the Independent (http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/rear-window-making-italy-work-did-mussolini-really-get-the-trains-running-on-time-1367688.html). It is, in fact, a myth traceable to contemporary propaganda from the Ventennio. The punctuality of the trains was used in fascist propaganda as a symbol of a return to order for the country, but in reality it was only the systematic censorship of news regarding accidents and rail disruptions that allowed this idea to form. \n\nTo those who may feel nostalgic about fascism: the Mascellone (meaning \u201cbig jaw\u201d, a derogatory nickname for Mussolini) ended up hanging upside down with people kicking his corpse. Ask yourselves why that is. ","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"\"When he was there, the trains ran on time\": A handbook against fascist lies"}

Then we spend that week putting it into action, and see what works/what doesn't and make a list of effective praxis. If we think it's successful enough, we try to make it a routine thing. If it wasn't successful, we discuss what happened and brainstorm alternatives. Some subjects might last longer than a week, some weeks might have several interrelated subjects, the format isn't very strict. \n\nWe also have general discussion at the end of meetings where it's open-forum, anyone can bring up anything at all, maybe something that they thought about earlier that upset them, or an event they read about and want to share.

I know self-promotion is generally frowned upon but I haven't been able to get an agent yet to promote my work for me and in my opinion self-promotion is how independent artists and writers stay independent, and we need more independent voices. I will also be active on other threads, so that I'm not just promoting my work.\n\nI am a volunteer, anarchist activist, blogger, organic farmer, and writer on human and ecological issues, rights, preservation, and equity, and I am trying to get the word out about my book. Tools of Control chronicles the history of humankind from some of our greatest achievements to our biggest mistakes, explaining how we went from freedom to slavery with the development of the world's most controlling institutions on Earth: governments, the Church and its rulers, corporate media, and transnational corporations more broadly. My book explains how they have exploited and destroyed much of the planet and life on Earth and what we can do preserve and protect life on Earth and the natural world.  \n\nThe full title is Tools of Control: A Book about How Four Growing Institutions Control Human Thought, Behavior, and Identity, and How We Can Destroy Them and Attain Justice, Freedom, Autonomy, Sustainability, Biodiversity, and Human and Ecological Well-being. \n\nThis is the first section of the book that explains what it's all about: https://toolsofcontrol.com/2017/08/12/tools-of-control-preface-index-and-part-one/\n\nYou can also find news articles and a ton of other work of mine available to read for free here: http://toolsofcontrol.com/content-navigator/. \n\nMy writing is very non-partisan, very opposed to concentrated power and propaganda, and very much focused on human and ecological rights and equity. The book posits all humans are capable of being autonomous, that there is no such thing as legitimate rule or legitimate state violence, that businesses can and should be run and owned by their workers without fiat currency (using barter, social currencies, and resource based economies in its place), that communities should organize voluntarily and govern themselves, resources should be owned collectively and sustainably with human and ecological needs in balance, and we should all have the right to do as we please as long as what we do harms no one else or the environment, (except in self-defense). I believe this is the only way to have a truly free world. The dystopian vision of billionaires, self-righteous, religious zealots and rulers, and dictators has overshadowed nearly everything of value on this Earth, and we must work to dismantle their power and infrastructure, take back the stolen wealth of the world, and build and strengthen agrarian, egalitarian, sustainable, money-less cooperative communities and collaboratives. \n\nI do the work I do for free because I believe important information should be free, but I also need to make a living to keep doing this work and to fund my ultimate goal of creating organic, sustainable community non-profit permaculture farms, food forests, and water systems (wells and water collectors) in food and water insecure regions to increase food and water security, sovereignty, and health around the globe, especially within indigenous communities. More on that can be found here: http://toolsofcontrol.com/food-for-all-donations-and-partners/. (I am currently using my yard to grow and donate organic produce for people in need, but I am very limited by space.)\n\nMy book is not doom and gloom as some may perceive on a first glance. It doesn't just outline problems. It outlines specifically which institutions, people, and traits, historically and now, most greatly perpetuate the world's problems, how, why, and what we can do about it. But the solutions for a better world may be better known than the how, where, and why of it all. It's not hard to create a hypothetical utopia. What is hard is taking our current reality and turning it into that utopia. For example, most people know it's an environmental imperative to switch to renewable sources of energy. That's obvious and it's easy to write about a hypothetical scenario in which we use them exclusively. But how we overcome the greatest pragmatic obstacles like oil companies and every industry that runs off fossil fuels and doesn't want to change because they don't want to lose money is the more difficult question. Or how do we create justice and peace in a world filled with war, war machines, bloated corrupt militaries, pigs, and financial rulers profiting from state violence? These are questions my book tackles.  So it isn't all pretty, but nothing realistic that will pull us out of the mess we're in is going to be all pretty. \n\nMy work has appeared in the Providence Journal. I have attended Harvard, Boston University, URI, and Warren Wilson Farm College where I studied sustainable agriculture and global studies. I have volunteered for nonprofits and continue to do so, taught classes on agriculture, campaigned for progressive politicians (before I was anarchist), and grown organic food for many people. But I want to do much more.\n\nIf you are or know a literary agent or publisher interested in helping me spread this work, please let me know.

Ideally I was looking for something between 20-45 minutes. I am hosting a movie showing that touches on prison abolition/resistance in conjunction with [SubMedia's Trouble Episode No Justice..Just Us](https://sub.media/video/trouble-4-no-justice-just-us/), which focuses on combating state repression.\n\nFor background, I live in a small town with a growing anti-racist/abolitionist movement, that is generally moving to be more and more radical. Most of the media and viewpoints that are generally communicated in organizing circles are more \"progressive\" than radical, even though people are willing to listen to and use radical language.\n \nThere are very few explicitly anarchist or anti-authoritarian organizers in the area, but I think people are open to be down with expanding the tactics and methods they use and further developing more radical and aggressive positions, especially when it comes to anti-racist work in our area. Currently, we are in the beginning stages of kicking off a campaign to end cash bail in our county with the intention of continuing to combat the prison system on all fronts. In light of this I am planning a film showing for this upcoming [J20 Base building campaign](https://crimethinc.com/2017/11/15/january-20-2018-build-the-base-take-the-initiative-a-call-to-expand-our-capacity) highlighting national approaches to anti-state organizing and prison movements, so I was hoping to get some ideas and movie suggestions!

Their character, their habits, their appetites undergo a complete transformation when torn from their soil in field and forest. With human nature caged in a narrow space, whipped daily into submission, how can we speak of its potentialities?\n\nFreedom, expansion, opportunity, and, above all, peace and repose, alone can teach us the real dominant factors of human nature and all its wonderful possibilities.\n\nAnarchism, then, really stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations.\n\nThis is not a wild fancy or an aberration of the mind. It is the conclusion arrived at by hosts of intellectual men and women the world over; a conclusion resulting from the close and studious observation of the tendencies of modern society: individual liberty and economic equality, the twin forces for the birth of what is fine and true in man.\u201c","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Good quote from Emma Goldman on \u201cmuh human nature!\u201d"}
