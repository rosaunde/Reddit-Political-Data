I like how with this paper I can make poster style stickers and tiny logo stickers but after they smudge they are just an eyesore and of course because they have been soaked they have gone from hard to remove to near impossible. so if any of you comrades have any good product recommendations to either make the stickers I make now last longer or create stickers that can survive the rain of course without raising the price of production by to much. \nthank you and happy may day\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"what do you all recommend for making stickers"}

Ben strawmans the entire topic into that transgender medicine is about to reduce suicidality and suicide attempt rates. Its like you would say that anti depression medicine is to reduce suicidality, which is not. Its to reduce depression. It CAN help (if you are even suicidal), but mainly its to reduce depression. The same for gender dysphoria - its mainly to reduce gender dyhsproia. \n\nREDUCING GENDER DYSPHORIA &lt;\n\nThat is the entire main purpose behind hormone therapy, SRS, FFS and so on.\n\nAlso his question 'why arent you 60' is pretty dumb because i think thats not a good comparison. Age is just a complete subjective idea and concept for another complete subjective idea (calendar) which says how often the earth has rotate around the sun since your birth. Of course everything is subjective in some sense like pain, but pain is still a fundemental part of us so i think you cant compare age and pain, altough they are both subjective, one is fundental in us....the same apllies to gender identity, so the comparison between gender identitty and age is stupid. The more accurate comparison would be maturity of someone, you know like foe example 10 year olds which brains are mature faster than others, and have a brain of a 40 year old or the other way around, adults who still have the brain of usually a 5 year old. \n\nAnd please go on Hbomberguy's curious cat and ask him if he would do a debunking video on this","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Ben Shapiro LIES about Transgender people and data"}

To the West this was a pro-capitalist and democratic uprising, being praised as a resistance against evil communists. To the Chinese, and tankies in general, the revolution was a rebellion of Western infiltrators, CIA op, dividing the way of Oriental East.\n\nNeither were true. The most surprising historic moments of Tiananmen Square 1989, and the core of protest structure itself, was by the deep tradition of anarchists in China. In fact, like many past and present modern revolutions (Arab Springs, ZAD, OWS, Occupy Mong Kok), the 1989 mass protest was organized by BWAF, Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation, Chinese anarchists and autonomists union. The BWAF was seeing the unstable and ruptured of economy in a false socialist state, they organized students, workers, peasants and anyone who were abandoned by the so-called \"economic reform\" by the revisionists that only benefit the wealthy elites.\n\n[From Marxist.com:](http://www.marxist.com/china-tiananmen-today250599.htm)\n\n&gt; To their great credit the workers' leadership that did emerge, in the form of the Beijing Autonomous Workers Federation (BAWF) had a revolutionary proletarian instinct as to the direction that had to be taken. It is barely reported in the Chinese or Western press even today, that it was this force that was the primary reason why the military to intervened so heavy-handedly on June 4th 1989.\n\n&gt; The BWAF saw the working class as \"the most advanced class\" having a \"special role\" to \"correctly\" lead the democratic patriotic movement. The Federation's structure had \"no leadership posts only a hierarchy of committees and methods of electing and recalling members.\" \"The leadership were not interested in wielding power and were very clear [that] nobody had to be any more powerful than anyone else.\"\n\n&gt; The anti-elitism of the workers extended their conception of political enemies to include opposition to Zhao Ziyang and the reform factions of the party who they considered all to be part of one faction the \"harm the people faction\". They viewed the Deng years as years of the victimisation of the working class.\n\n&gt; BAWF issued scathing attacks on the economic competence of the Government:\n\n&gt; \"You leaders have made a complete mess of it. You excuse yourselves by claiming that \"having no experience in building socialism, we are taking a billion people across the river with us by feeling for rocks step by step.' Well you have made quite a lot of people 'feel for rocks' for quite a few decades already. How much headway have you made? What about those who followed you but did not find the rocks, did they not all drown? You officials are playing with people's lives The decade of reform has no direction and no goals. Where do you plan to lead the billion people? Is there one official who can answer that? You said that \"let it be white or black a cat that catches mice is a good cat.' Well, let us ask you something. What if both white and black cats try to catch the same mouse wouldn't there be a fight? This would definitely lead to confusion and conflict, causing deepening rifts. The outcome would be that the official cat gets fatter and fatter and the people's cat gets thinner and thinner. Is this the kind of cure you prescribe for the nation?\" (Chinese Sociology and Anthropology Fall 1990)\n\nPerhaps the controversial conflict between MLM/tankies and BWAF is that the BWAF used direct democracy as their driving platform, and because the Maoism's tunnel vision on democracy as a \"Western products\", BWAF's democratic platform was heavily smeared by the state capitalists and co-opted by pro-Western nationalists. BWAF never called for patriotism, they saw it as self-determinism for the Chinese working class, as quote *the working class as the most advanced class having a special role to correctly lead the democratic patriotic movement.* Like many other anarchist revolutions, they called for horizontal and non-hierarchy organizing of the working class in the revolution, founding the council of decision-making in the occupy of the Square, Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation. The revolution was a blood bath and lasted for more than a month. It ended in June 4, 1989 with over 10000 people murdered. This was the largest modern working class revolution in Asia.\n\nToday BWAF and other anarchist organizations are declared by the state capitalists as illegal organization. But the spirit for a free anarchism future lives on.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Tiananmen Square 1989: The Misrepresented and Co-opted Working Class Revolution with Anarchism's Origin"}

{"author":"kevinfat2","created_utc":1525655726,"num_comments":3,"score":4,"selftext":"I read the following article and was reflecting on it. I don't think I fully buy its explaination. I wonder what you guys think. I'm just going to ramble on some thoughts.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html\n\n\"As external conditions change, it becomes tougher to meet the three conditions that sociologists since the 1950s have considered crucial to making close friends: proximity; repeated, unplanned interactions; and a setting that encourages people to let their guard down and confide in each other, said Rebecca G. Adams, a professor of sociology and gerontology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. This is why so many people meet their lifelong friends in college, she added.\"\n\nWhen you're a child time is a commodity and and so it doesn't matter what you do as there is plenty of time. That is to analyze this in economic terms the opportunity cost of all the random stuff a child does does not exist. As an adult working long hours everything has an opportunity cost. And subconsciously the temptation is to prioritize network connections of high social status.\n\nAnother quote from the article:\n\"Thayer Prime, a 32-year-old strategy consultant who lives in London, has even developed a playful 100-point scale (100 being \u201cbest friend forever\u201d). In her mind, she starts to dock new friend candidates as they begin to display annoying or disloyal behavior. Nine times out of 10, she said, her new friends end up from 30 to 60, or little more than an acquaintance.\"\n\nAnd moreover as we go through college and so forth the doctrinal system takes an effect. As Noam Chomsky points out if you think about it a big part of a good education at say a university is learning the right thoughts and right social behavior patterns. I'm not saying people are completely conscious of it. But the problem is that these patterns aren't necessarily the personality traits that someone wants in a friend, in a business network connection sure, but friend maybe no. This point I don't think I've read anyone point it out.\n\nWhat works as a kid won't work as an adult. People are attracted to youth and beauty. And I don't mean in terms of people being youthful and beautiful having an advantage in dating. For example an unusual number of CEO's are over 6 feet tall. If you're not fat not bald not short you're going to have an easier time making friends. If you're fat bald and short you're going to find things harder. People will filter you out more likely and the important thing to realize is that this filter happens at a subconscious level. I don't have a citation for this off hand. When everyone is a kid this isn't so much a problem. But when you're older and unattractive this shows up.\n\nAnd to bring up economics again why should anyone spend time with an ugly old person unless they are like that too. It is a serious question. Its not enough to say I'm a generally good person so people should hang out with me. That is a non-economic view. An economic view would look at supply and demand and deduce that people are going to look at a generally good person with some annoying properties and think can I do better?","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Why friendships are hard to make?"}

Rather than the Congressperson telling you how they intend to vote on the issues, Michael will provide information to help his constituents decide and be bound by their decision.

Michael has developed a blockchain-based voting system, [Voterfied](https://voterfied.com/), in which constituents can log in and anonymously vote on a myriad of topics relevant to congressional legislation. Michael will pose questions to constituents ranging from tax reform, jobs, health care, the military, gun control, the environment, individual civil rights, and much more.

The point is that people should not force their own worldviews on others and practice a more \"live and let live\" behavior towards others.\n\nIf any kind of cooperation were to arise, I think the following criteria has to be met, I am going to list here points where we can agree and point where we have to reach a compromise, and I would like to see the response from both factions what they think about it.\n\nI am personally an ancap, I can't compromise on rightfully obtained private property, but I have a few points where I agree more with the left. So if the top/bottom (Y) axis represents authoritarianism/voluntarism then I am 90% a voluntarist, and if the left/right (X) axis represents equality vs hierarchy then I am about 75% on the right wing.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Positions where Ancaps &amp; Ancoms agree:\n\n* **Anti IP**: We both agree that intellectual property should be abolished. In case of defamation or identity theft other solutions could exist, but IP in order to protect mental constructs does not fit the criteria of real property. Furthermore initiating coercion against violators (which is how IP is enforced) is wrong. If IP can be defended without coercion then it's valid, but so far nobody has implemented that, until that time, it remains invalid.\n\n* **Privacy**: Many leftists are huge pro-privacy proponents. Privacy is basically just private property. You own yourself and your property, therefore nobody should be able to violate the sovereignty of your personhood and your property without your consent. It's nice to see leftists acknowledging private property without even realizing it.\n\n* **Anti-Police State**: I don't think anyone sane would support such a thing but especially in more libertarian communities most people are against it. Right Libertarians denounce Fascism and Nazism, the Alt-Right is not Libertarian. And Left Libertarians distance themselves from Stalinism, Bolshevism and so on. There might be an overlap but they might just be trolls or agent provocateurs, so I'd rather judge people personally not put everyone under 1 umbrella.\n\n* **Drug Legalization**: We both agree that getting jailed for life for a flower in your pocket is absurd.\n\n* **Prostitution Legalization**: We both agree that consenting adults selling their time and body should not be jailed for it. Your body is your most important property, limiting the use of your most precious property is inherently immoral.\n\n* **LGBT Legalization**: No liberty minded person would use force to prevent two consenting adults loving eachother. \n\n* **Free Speech / Anti Censorship**: No liberty minded person would use force to prevent people from talking and sharing their opinions.\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Positions that Ancoms need to work on:\n\n* **Regulations:** Leftists need to realize that every single regulation in the history of mankind is hurting poor people at the expense of the Elites. Ancaps don't support regulations because we have realized this massive con. Leftists constantly get conned into supporting big government regulations and then not realizing how much that hurts small people. I assume the leftist goal is to help poor people,well then if the costs of doing business skyrockets due to huge regulations then it will be even harder for poor people to compete. Where do you think the wealth inequality comes from? A free market will not be egalitarian, but it will be much fairer than a regulated one. Every regulation just transfers power from big corporations to the government. If you hate monopolistic big corporations, why do you love the supreme monopoly of violence? A corporation that is already in monopoly has nowhere to grow, all it can do is just maintain it's monopoly. Why the hell do you think big corporations support regulations? Why do you think Facebook \"welcomes regulation\" after luring in more than 2 billion users having a near monopoly? What do you think the endgame is? And then there is the whole Regulatory Capture concept. Simply put all regulations are bad, even if it sounds totally benign, their end result will always be the same, making a bigger and more authoritarian government.\n\n* **Taxes:** Same with taxes. You all support taxing the rich, but guess what, the rich have sophisticated methods to avoid taxes. The Elite pay almost no taxes, and that will never change. Whenever you talk about higher taxes, all of those taxes will be paid by the middle class. You are always increasing taxes on small businesses and I am sick of that. I am a lower middle class person and I am sick of paying massive taxes most of it the result of these \"progressive policies\". The middle class is getting squeezed out, and society looks like a hourglass with a thin middle and everyone poor and a few people rich. This is why wealth inequality is increasing, this and the regulations. You are destroying small businesses, and the poor people are getting stuck in poverty forever. Welfare won't help them, a giant wealth redistribution scheme won't happen, people have to be self-sustainable. I thought leftists are pro-workers, but how can workers be more free than paying no taxes?. I just think all taxes have to be abolished, starting with the income tax. You'd be amazed how more wealthy people would become after that. \n\n\nSo poverty can be essentially eliminated with a combination of: deregulation + tax lowering + technology. But currently only technology is improving, the other parts are getting worse and worse.\n\n* **Recognizing Private Property:** Leftists need to recognize private property, the essence and core survival strategy of every biological organism is to gather resources and then trade the surplus resources for other resources in deficit. Private property, resource gathering and trading is a fundamental behavior of any biological entity, this can't be denied there is a very good reason why this exists. In a free world nobody would deny leftists the right to form cooperatives and communist villages, but that entity itself is a property as well, it's just that it's equally owned. We would recognize those establishments are your property, in return of you to recognize our properties which might have a different structure. It's just a debate between hierarchy and equality and to know which is better both have to coexist to experiment with, so I just want a \"live and let live\" framework.\n\n* **Employee-ism:** In my view in an ideal Ancap society there would be no employees, only private contractors and small-medium sized businesses. So the entire class struggle between employers employees would be resolved. Everyone who is competent will just create their own business, and hire other people are private contractors. A private contractor is just a freelancer hired by contract who can negotiate his wage and requirements with no strings attached. Other people would just be small businesspeople, everyone running their own small or medium sized business. There would be full employment as would be  no obstacles in business, and there would be a much bigger wealth equality as monopolies would implode under the forces of competition. So leftists need to realize that competition can actually create equality, not necessarily a perfect one, but one where everyone has the chance to be involved and not just be a servant but also a participant. The \"labor struggle\" can be fixed this easily.\n\n* **Denouncing Totalitarians:** If the left wants to clear it's reputation it really needs to denounce all links with the totalitarian regimes in the 20th century: Bolshevism, Stalinism, Leninism, Maoism, Pol-Pot-ism, etc... It need to embrace the atrocities that leftists did: The Holomodor, Gulag System, Torture, Famines (both intentional &amp; systemic), Slave Labor,etc.. And it also needs to separate itself from currently active authoritarian elements \"tankies\". The Left is more responsible because while Nazis have been exposed for what they are, Stalinists have received virtually no criticism. It seems like it was swept up under a rug, and there are still many Stalin and Lenin apologists and fanboys and girls. Also Marx actively abused his maid, which was kind of ironic for a champion of workers. So there are many things that need to be exposed, many crimes that need to be taken responsibility of and many positions that need to be more clear if the left wants to clear it's name.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n# Positions that Ancaps need to work on:\n\n\n* **Recognition &amp; Clarity:** A lot of ancaps conflate totalitarian leftist dictatorships with a theoretical voluntary left anarcho-communism. It's a little bit dishonest and very misleading to compare Bakunin with Stalin so at least the libertarian left if faithful to their principles has to be distinguished from the totalitarian aspects, even though some times the lines are blurry sometimes I get confused who is who, but nontheless I think a libertarian left does exist and ancaps need to recognize this and classify them separately. It helps nobody if people are mislabeled and conflated with others.\n\n* **Alt-Right:** Ancaps and Libertarians need to get rid of the Alt-Right, it's full of Neo-Nazis, Anti-Semites, Holocaust Deniers, Pinochet Apologists and other Fascists. We are both getting subverted by totalitarian forces while at the same time being ridiculed and conflated with fascists. We have a separate identity of freedom and private property, and we should not let ourselves be herded into the Neo-Nazi factions.\n\n* **Crony-Capitalism:** Ancaps need to make a more clear distinction between Crony Capitalism &amp; Anarcho-Capitalism. There is not much literature on this, the definition needs to be more clear and Ancaps need to distance themselves from cronies. Cronies are no better than Stalinists. Corporate Welfare is just Socialism so that needs to be opposed just as much as any other welfare. We need a sustainable business structure one that is self-sustainable without subsidies. I imagine an ideal Ancap society where everyone is a small or medium sized business owner, or a private contractor. I don't think there will be \"employees\", so that already solves the leftist critique, and no business would reach monopoly due to the freedom of competition and the lack of obstackes in creating a business. Both the funding and the simplicity (due to no regulations and taxes) would make it a very sustainable and simple system that would generate perpetual prosperity. In contrast what we have now is a very corrupt system, where many people are unemployed and can't break out of poverty due to the government obstacles.\n","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"Ancap - Ancom Alliance?""num_comments":43,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Ancap - Ancom Alliance?"}

For example, if the country sinks deeply into a recession, a depoliticized population could very easily be mobilized into thinking it's somebody else's fault: \"Why are our lives collapsing? There have to be bad guys out there doing something for things to be going so badly\"-and the bad guys can be Jews, or homosexuals, or blacks, or Communists, whatever you pick. [...]\n\n&gt;*MAN: Do you know about the connections between the Republican Party and the neo-Nazis which were revealed a few months ago-and could you talk a bit about what might be the significance of that in this context?*\n\n&gt;[...] There's this part of the Bush campaign called the \"Ethnic Outreach Committee,\" which tries to organize ethnic minorities; obviously that doesn't mean blacks or Hispanics, it means Ukrainians, Poles, that sort of business. And it turned out that it was being run by a bunch of East European Nazis, Ukrainian Nazis, hysterical anti-Semites, Romanians who came out of the Iron Guard, and so on. Well, finally this got exposed; some of the people were reshuffled, some were put into other positions in the Republican Party-but it all just passed over very quietly. The Democrats never even raised the issue during the election campaign.\n\n&gt;[...] In all of the books that have come out by people in the Reagan administration, it's been extremely difficult to hide the fact that Reagan didn't have the foggiest idea what was going on. Whenever he wasn't properly programmed, the things that would come out of his mouth were kind of like - they weren't lies really, they were kind of like the babbling of a child. If a child babbles, it's not lies, it's just sort of on some other plane. To be able to lie, you have to have a certain degree of competence, you have to know what truth is. And there didn't seem to be any indication that that was the case here. So in fact, all of the fuss in the Iran-contra hearings about \"did Reagan know or didn't he know\" [about the National Security Council's illegal dealings with Iran and the Nicaraguan contras], or \"did he remember or didn't he remember?\" I personally regarded as a cover-up. What's the difference? He didn't know if nobody told him, and he didn't remember if he forgot. \n\n[Source: Understanding Power](http://www.ditext.com/chomsky/power.pdf), Chapter 2, pp. 51-54.

I\u2019m just going to give some context because I had a eureka moment and wrote all of what you\u2019re about to see on Inotes so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s grammatical errors and my writing style may be all over the place. Obviously this idea would still be in a stateless, non-hierarchical society and this idea is up to any and all criticism you may have! As I said I wrote this quickly and I may have missed some fundamental flaws in this new concept. Anyways, without further ado here it is:\n\n\nGift economy where you have an account (don\u2019t have to make one but if you don\u2019t it may be harder to receive gifts) on a phone, laptop or even a new device made specifically for this idea and on that account you make a username. When you want to receive a gift you can ask the person if they want your username or vice Versa.  If they get your username the scenario goes like this:\n\nJohn1617 added mark1047 \nJohn1617 has started a new gift proposal with mark1047\nMark1047 agrees to the gift proposal\nJohn1617 gift proposal of 10 eggs is pending \nJohn1617 has sent 10 eggs \nMark1047 has received 10 eggs!\n\nAfter this mark1047\u2019s inbox will look like this:\n\n18 seconds ago\nJohn1617 gave you ten eggs. You have not sent anything back.\n\nNow if someone wanted to send john1617 a gift they could look at his transactions and see that he received ten eggs eighteen seconds ago and has not sent anything back. if John1617 did not want people to see what gifts he is receiving he can make them private. The time received and if John1617 sent anything back can still be viewed but the item wouldn\u2019t be.\n\nNow in this society people could see if the person they are gifting is trustworthy and would send a gift back (after all gift economy\u2019s are still self centred) and with this can make up judgment on if they want to gift someone.\n\nMany different other features could be added such as messaging and reviews.

For example, if the country sinks deeply into a recession, a depoliticized population could very easily be mobilized into thinking it's somebody else's fault: \"Why are our lives collapsing? There have to be bad guys out there doing something for things to be going so badly\"-and the bad guys can be Jews, or homosexuals, or blacks, or Communists, whatever you pick. [...]\n\n&gt;*MAN: Do you know about the connections between the Republican Party and the neo-Nazis which were revealed a few months ago-and could you talk a bit about what might be the significance of that in this context?*\n\n&gt;[...] There's this part of the Bush campaign called the \"Ethnic Outreach Committee,\" which tries to organize ethnic minorities; obviously that doesn't mean blacks or Hispanics, it means Ukrainians, Poles, that sort of business. And it turned out that it was being run by a bunch of East European Nazis, Ukrainian Nazis, hysterical anti-Semites, Romanians who came out of the Iron Guard, and so on. Well, finally this got exposed; some of the people were reshuffled, some were put into other positions in the Republican Party-but it all just passed over very quietly. The Democrats never even raised the issue during the election campaign.\n\n&gt;[...] In all of the books that have come out by people in the Reagan administration, it's been extremely difficult to hide the fact that Reagan didn't have the foggiest idea what was going on. Whenever he wasn't properly programmed, the things that would come out of his mouth were kind of like - they weren't lies really, they were kind of like the babbling of a child. If a child babbles, it's not lies, it's just sort of on some other plane. To be able to lie, you have to have a certain degree of competence, you have to know what truth is. And there didn't seem to be any indication that that was the case here. So in fact, all of the fuss in the Iran-contra hearings about \"did Reagan know or didn't he know\" [about the National Security Council's illegal dealings with Iran and the Nicaraguan contras], or \"did he remember or didn't he remember?\" I personally regarded as a cover-up. What's the difference? He didn't know if nobody told him, and he didn't remember if he forgot. \n\n[Source: Understanding Power](http://www.ditext.com/chomsky/power.pdf), Chapter 2, pp. 51-54.

How come we have a racist asshole as our president and why are we never talking about the Panama Papers and making a bigger deal about the fact that trillions of dollars could have been taxed and recycled back into our society?  How come college has become a sham and why are so many people unfulfilled, afraid, and alone?  And why is all of our valiant efforts reduced to blocking traffic and costing taxpayers money?\n\nI think about these things a lot, which is why I read a lot about different things.  But when I saw this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX3M8Ka9vUA&amp;t=168s\n\nIt just blew my mind.

{"author":"Benjbear","created_utc":1526165564,"num_comments":8,"score":43,"selftext":"WE HAVE BEEN discussing how essential it is to have love, and we saw that one cannot acquire or buy it; yet without love, all our plans for a perfect social order in which there is no exploitation, no regimentation, will have no meaning at all, and I think it is very important to understand this while we are young.\n\nWherever one goes in the world, it does not matter where, one finds that society is in a perpetual state of conflict. There are always the powerful, the rich, the well-to-do on the one hand, and the labourers on the other; and each one is enviously competing, each one wants a higher position, a bigger salary, more power, greater prestige. That is the state of the world, and so there is always war going on both within and without.\n\nNow, if you and I want to bring about a complete revolution in the social order, the first thing we have to understand is this instinct for the acquisition of power. Most of us want power in one form or another. We see that through wealth and power we shall be able to travel, associate with important people and become famous; or we dream of bringing about a perfect society. We think we shall achieve that which is good through power; but the very pursuit of power - power for ourselves, power for our country, power for an ideology - is evil, destructive, because it inevitably creates opposing powers, and so there is always conflict.\n\nIs it not right, then, that education should help you, as you grow up to perceive the importance of bringing about a world in which there is no conflict either within or without, a world in which you are not in conflict with your neighbour or with any group of people because the drive of ambition, which is the desire for position and power, has utterly ceased? And is it possible to create a society in which there will be no inward or out- ward conflict? Society is the relationship between you and me; and if our relationship is based on ambition each one of us wanting to be more powerful than the other, then obviously we shall always be in conflict. So, can this cause of conflict be removed? Can we all educate ourselves not to be competitive, not to compare ourselves with somebody else, not to want this or that position - in a word, not to be ambitious at all?\n\nWhen you go outside the school with you parents, when you read the newspapers or talk to people, you must have noticed that almost everybody wants to bring about a change in the world. And have you not also noticed that these very people are always in conflict with each other over something or other - over ideas, property, race, caste or religion? Your parents, your neighbours, the ministers and bureaucrats - are they not all ambitious, struggling for a better position, and therefore always in conflict with somebody? Surely, it is only when all this competitiveness is removed that there will be a peaceful society in which all of us can live happily, creatively.\n\nNow, how is this to be done? Can regulation, legislation, or the training of your mind not to be ambitious, do away with ambition? Outwardly you may be trained not to be ambitious, socially you may cease to compete with others; but inwardly you will still be ambitious, will you not? And is it possible to sweep away completely this ambition, which is bringing so much misery to human beings? Probably you have not thought about it before, because nobody has talked to you like this; but now that somebody is talking to you about it, don't you want to find out if it is possible to live in this world richly, fully, happily, creatively, without the destructive drive of ambition, without competition? Don't you want to know how to live so that your life will not destroy another or cast a shadow across his path?\n\nYou see, we think this is a Utopian dream which can never be brought about in fact; but I am not talking about Utopia, that would be nonsense. Can you and I, who are simple, ordinary people, live creatively in this world without the drive of ambition which shows itself in various ways as the desire for power, position? You will find the right answer when you love what you are doing. If you are an engineer merely because you must earn a livelihood, or because your father or society expects it of you, that is another form of compulsion; and compulsion in any form creates a contradiction, conflict. Whereas, if you really love to be an engineer, or a scientist or if you can plant a tree, or paint a picture, or write a poem, not to gain recognition but just because you love to do it, then you will find that you never compete with another. I think this is the real key: to love what you do.\n\nBut when you are young it is often very difficult to know what you love to do, because you want to do so many things. You want to be an engineer, a locomotive driver, an airplane pilot zooming along in the blue skies; or perhaps you want to be a famous orator or politician. You may want to be an artist, a chemist, a poet or a carpenter. You may want to work with your head, or do something with your hands. Is any of these things what you really love to do, or is your interest in them merely a reaction to social pressures? How can you find out? And is not the true purpose of education to help you to find out, so that as you grow up you can begin to give your whole mind, heart and body to that which you really love to do?\n\nTo find out what you love to do demands a great deal of intelligence; because, if you are afraid of not being able to earn a livelihood, or of not fitting into this rotten society, then you will never find. But,if you are not frightened, if you refuse to be pushed into the groove of tradition by your parents, by your teachers, by the superficial demands of society, then there is a possibility of discovering what it is you really love to do. So, to discover, there must be no fear of not surviving.\n\nBut most of us are afraid of not surviving, we say, \"What will happen to me if I don't do as my parents say, if I don't fit into this society?\" Being frightened, we do as we are told, and in that there is no love, there is only contradiction; and this inner contradiction is one of the factors that bring about destructive ambition.\n\nSo, it is a basic function of education to help you to find out what you really love to do, so that you can give your whole mind and heart to it, because that creates human dignity, that sweeps away mediocrity, the petty bourgeois mentality. That is why it is very important to have the right teachers, the right atmosphere so that you will grow up with the love which expresses itself in what you are doing. Without this love your examinations, your knowledge, your capacities your position and possessions are just ashes, they have no meaning; without this love your actions are going to bring more wars, more hatred, more mischief and destruction.\n\nAll this may mean nothing to you, because outwardly you are still very young, but I hope it will mean something to your teachers - and also to you, somewhere inside.\n\nhttp://www.jiddu-krishnamurti.net/en/think-on-these-things/1963-00-00-jiddu-krishnamurti-think-on-these-things-chapter-7\n\nForgive if this isn't relevant, but I find it very pertinent to anarchism.\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Power and love"}

Let us put aside the whole thought of reform; let us wipe it out of our blood. Let us completely forget this idea of wanting to reform the world. Then let us see actually what is happening, right throughout the world. Political parties always have a limited programme which, even if fulfilled, invariably brings about mischief, which then has to be corrected once again. We are always talking about political action as being a most important action, but political action is not the way. Let us put it out of our minds. All social and economic reforms come under this category. Then there is the religious formula of action based on belief, idealism, dogmatism, conformity to some so-called divine recipe. In this is involved authority and acceptance, obedience and the utter denial of freedom. Though religions talk of peace on earth they contribute to the disorder because they are a factor of division. Also the churches have always taken some political stand in times of crisis, so they are really political bodies, and we have seen that all political action is divisive. The churches have never really denied war: on the contrary they have waged war. So when one puts aside the religious recipes, as one puts aside the political formulas - what is left, and what is one to do? Naturally civic order must be maintained: you have to have water in the taps. If you destroy civic order you have to start again from the beginning. So, what is one to do?\n\nQuestioner: That is what I am actually asking you.\n\nKrishnamurti: Be concerned with radical change, with total revolution. The only revolution is the revolution between man and man, between human beings. That is our only concern. In this revolution there are no blueprints, no ideologies, no conceptual utopias. We must take the fact of the actual relationship between men and change that radically. That is the real thing. And this revolution must be immediate, it must not take time. It is not achieved through evolution, which is time.\n\nQuestioner: What do you mean? All historical changes have taken place in time; none of them has been immediate. You are proposing something quite inconceivable.\n\nKrishnamurti: If you take time to change, do you suppose that life is in suspension during the time it takes to change? It isn't in suspension. Everything you are trying to change is being modified and perpetuated by the environment, by life itself. So there is no end to it. It is like trying to clean the water in a tank which is constantly being refilled with dirty water. So time is out.\n\nhttp://www.jkrishnamurti.org/krishnamurti-teachings/view-text.php?tid=5&amp;chid=495&amp;w=freedom&amp;s=Text","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"\"Let us put aside the whole thought of reform; let us wipe it out of our blood\""}

{"author":"Benjbear","created_utc":1526254505,"num_comments":0,"score":7,"selftext":"\nEditor\u2019s Introduction:\n\nWe know next to nothing about the man historian Etienne Balazs called \u201cChina\u2019s first political anarchist.\u201d Though we know so little about this fascinating Taoist writer, Balazs describes him as \u201ca daring thinker who went well beyond the vague Utopianism of popular Taoism by placing his argument firmly on the political level.\u201d As such, his sole surviving work constitutes one of the earliest and clearest expositions of \u201cLibertarian anarchism,\u201d (Balazs\u2019 phrasing) in world history; a feat of especial importance in an era of Chinese history marked by rising nihilism and libertineage.\n\nIn his short treatise, Bao Jingyan begins by countering the prevailing wisdom of ancient China\u2019s dominant \u201cConfucian literati,\u201d and their fundamental assumption that the heavens had condemned some to serve while elevating others to rule. In fact, he states, all such philosophies simply served the interests of those who formulated them, solidifying the Confucian monopoly of office-holding. Rejecting the natural authority of rulers, Bao Jingyan encouraged his audience to investigate the ways of nature and the history of world before the rise of the ruling classes.\n\nBefore men sought power\u2014before they strove to conquer nature as well as each other\u2014they enjoyed both peace and prosperity. He presents an idyllic, heavily romanticized vision of ancient life, in which humans joined in \u201cmystic unity\u201d with nature, did not suffer disease or privation, and recognized no social distinctions or disturbances of the peace. Grown fat and decadent, ancient man lost \u201cThe Way and Its Virtue,\u201d providing the powerful with ample opportunities for establishing socio-political hierarchies. Gradually, but surely, the social distinction between Lord and Subject grew to include the great mass of common people ruled over by a small elite.\n\nWhile hierarchy provided the basis for imperial power, it also attempted to subvert and violate The Way and Its Virtue. As such, the very existence of social distinctions provided the impetus for the uprisings and revolution that caused cyclical dynastic collapse. Bao Jingyan concluded by suggesting that no one can truly live outside the unitary system of Nature, and even apparently unnatural socio-political hierarchies inevitably served to instruct the people in the necessity of virtuously governing themselves. Hope for once again attaining the ancients\u2019 mystical union with the natural order rested in individuals\u2019 personal moral commitments to be \u201cNeither Lord Nor Subject.\u201d\n\nAnthony Comegna, PhD Assistant Editor for Intellectual History\nNeither Lord Nor Subject\n\nTHE CONFUCIAN LITERATI SAY: \u201cHeaven gave birth to the people and then set rulers over them.\u201d But how can High Heaven have said this in so many words? Is it not rather that interested parties make this their pretext? The fact is that the strong oppressed the weak and the weak submitted to them; the cunning tricked the innocent and the innocent served them. It was because there was submission that the relation of lord and subject arose, and because there was servitude that the people, being powerless, could be kept under control. Thus servitude and mastery result from the struggle between the strong and the weak and the contrast between the cunning and the innocent, and Blue Heaven has nothing whatsoever to do with it.\n\nWhen the world was in its original undifferentiated state, the Nameless (wu-ming, i.e., the Tao) was what was valued, and all creatures found happiness in self-fulfillment. Now when the cinnamon-tree has its bark stripped or the varnish-tree is cut, it is not done at the wish of the tree; when the pheasant\u2019s feathers are plucked or the kingfisher\u2019s torn out, it is not done by desire of the bird. To be bitted and bridled is not in accordance with the nature of the horse; to be put under the yoke and bear burdens does not give pleasure to the ox. Cunning has its origin in the use of force that goes against the true nature of things, and the real reason for harming creatures is to provide useless adornments. Thus catching the birds of the air in order to supply frivolous adornments, making holes in noses where no holes should be, tying beasts by the leg when nature meant them to be free, is not in accord with the destiny of the myriad creatures, all born to live out their lives unharmed. And so the people are compelled to labour so that those in office may be nourished; and while their superiors enjoy fat salaries, they are reduced to the direst poverty.\n\nIt is all very well to enjoy the infinite bliss of life after death, but it is preferable not to have died in the first place; and rather than acquire an empty reputation for integrity by resigning office and foregoing one\u2019s salary, it is better that there should be no office to resign. Loyalty and righteousness only appear when rebellion breaks out in the empire, filial obedience and parental love are only displayed when there is discord among kindred.\n\nIn the earliest times, there was neither lord nor subjects. Wells were dug for drinking-water, the fields were plowed for food, work began at sunrise and ceased at sunset; everyone was free and at ease; neither competing with each other nor scheming against each other, and no one was either glorified or humiliated. The waste lands had no paths or roads and the waterways no boats or bridges, and because there were no means of communication by land or water, people did not appropriate each other\u2019s property; no armies could be formed, and so people did not attack one another. Indeed since no one climbed up to seek out nests nor dived down to sift the waters of the deep, the phoenix nested under the eaves of the house and dragons disported in the garden pool. The ravening tiger could be trodden on, the poisonous snake handled. Men could wade through swamps without raising the waterfowl, and enter the woodlands without startling the fox or the hare. Since no one even began to think of gaining power or seeking profit, no dire events or rebellions occurred; and as spears and shields were not in use, moats and ramparts did not have to be built. All creatures lived together in mystic unity, all of them merged in the Way (Tao). Since they were not visited by plague or pestilence, they could live out their lives and die a natural death. Their hearts being pure, they were devoid of cunning. Enjoying plentiful supplies of food, they strolled about with full bellies. Their speech was not flowery, their behavior not ostentatious. How, then, could there have been accumulation of property such as to rob the people of their wealth, or severe punishments to trap and ensnare them? When this age entered on decadence, knowledge and cunning came into use. The Way and its Virtue (Tao te) having fallen into decay, a hierarchy was established. Customary regulations for promotion and degradation and for profit and loss proliferated, ceremonial garments such as the [gentry\u2019s] sash and sacrificial cap and the imperial blue and yellow [robes for worshiping Heaven and Earth] were elaborated. Buildings of earth and wood were raised high into the sky, with the beams and rafters painted red and green. The heights were overturned in quest of gems, the depths dived into in search of pearls; but however vast a collection of precious stones people might have assembled, it still would not have sufficed to satisfy their whims, and a whole mountain of gold would not have been enough to meet their expenditure, so sunk were they in depravity and vice, having transgressed against the fundamental principles of the Great Beginning. Daily they became further removed from the ways of their ancestors, and turned their back more and more upon man\u2019s original simplicity. Because they promoted the \u201cworthy\u201d to office, ordinary people strove for reputation, and because they prized material wealth, thieves and robbers appeared. The sight of desirable objects tempted true and honest hearts, and the display of arbitrary power and love of gain opened the road to robbery. So they made weapons with points and with sharp edges, and after that there was no end to usurpations and acts of aggression, and they were only afraid lest crossbows should not be strong enough, shields stout enough, lances sharp enough, and defences solid enough. Yet all this could have been dispensed with if there had been no oppression and violence from the start.\n\nTherefore it has been said: \u201cWho could make scepters without spoiling the unblemished jade? And how could altruism and righteousness (jen and i) be extolled unless the Way and its Virtue had perished?\u201d Although tyrants such as Chieh and Chou were able to burn men to death, massacre their advisers, make mince-meat of the feudal lords, cut the barons into strips, tear out men\u2019s hearts and break their bones, and go to the furthest extremes of tyrannical crime down to the use of torture by roasting and grilling, however cruel they may by nature have been, how could they have done such things if they had had to remain among the ranks of the common people? If they gave way to their cruelty and lust and butchered the whole empire, it was because, as rulers, they could do as they pleased. As soon as the relationship between lord and subject is established, hearts become daily more filled with evil designs, until the manacled criminals sullenly doing forced labour in the mud and the dust are full of mutinous thoughts, the Sovereign trembles with anxious fear in his ancestral temple, and the people simmer with revolt in the midst of their poverty and distress; and to try to stop them revolting by means of rules and regulations, or control them by means of penalties and punishments, is like trying to dam a river in full flood with a handful of earth, or keeping the torrents of water back with one finger.\n\nhttps://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/neither-lord-nor-subject","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Neither Lord nor Subject"}

I have done some basic digging when it comes to the general concept of anarchism and I am sympathetic to their goals, yet I do not believe them to be possible. Allow me to elaborate slightly; I believe that an Anarchist society is possible yet will never be due to external forces.\n\nFirstly, I am basing these beliefs upon the anarchist revolution in Catalonia in the 1930s and the Ukranian anarchists during the Russian revolution. My theory \\-as of this moment\\- goes that in times of extreme crisis, such as revolution, society as a whole turns to the most extreme of ideologies that tend to focus on strength and winning the power struggle. Thus, capitalists in an attempt to keep power turn to fascism and the only to beat fascism is through an equally strong ideology. Say what you will about capitalists and fascists, they sure know how to arrange a strong hierarchical military. The only way to beat a strong centralised military is to have a strong centralised military. But as we all know, anarchists are directly opposed to such authority unless justifiable: in this case, it is justified. However, by giving up power to a handful of general and creating a military capable of fighting the capitalists/fascists, you are giving them way too much power and asking them to hand over this obtained power.\n\nTL;DR; How could the anarchists properly resist the capitalists while staying anarchist and not going full Marxist\\-Leninist?\n\nP.S\\- I am still new to far left tactics so there is probably a rational response to this problem...","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"A question for anarchists..."}

Organized originally on the basis of ethnicity, early churches and religious groups were manifestations of the first kinds of mutual aid societies. They provided assistance to underprivileged members and urged collective values, as well as generally egalitarian values within the same church community.\n\nThe social gospel movement of the 19th and 20th century brought progressivism and overlapped with the rise of social democracy, some including people like Leo Tolstoy (radical theologian credited for Christian Anarchism) , Dorothy Day (syndicalist and founder of the Catholic Worker's Movement) , and Norman Thomas (Socialist Party politician and presbyterian minister).\n\nBy the 1960s, the civil rights movement took form and Martin Luther King Jr. took the lead as a [Baptist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_National_Baptist_Convention) minister. Today, the breakaway progressive denomination he helped found remains both a political and religious force in the United States. First a Christian but also a democratic socialist, King took influence from writers like Tolstoy, Henry George, and even Karl Marx, though disagreeing with the materialism of Marxist philosophy. At the time, social democrats associated with A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Ruston began the push for a grassroots coalition of organized labor, religious groups, and activist organizations to advance the civil rights movement, with the March on Washington being a primary example.\n\nThe National Council of Churches remains the largest ecumenical body in the United States and is representative of progressive and social gospel Christianity. King wrote of them, \"This great body\u2014the National Council of Churches\u2014has condemned segregation over and over again, and has requested its constituent denominations to do likewise.\"\n\nMoreover, employee ownership was a value that was at times even advocated by Conservative Christians. In a [recorded speech](https://youtu.be/rJFcpRxju2g), Reagan advocates for the formation of worker's owned businesses, explicitly on the basis of American community values.\n\nMy belief is that there should be a reframing of labor historiography in that organized labor and syndicalist ideas of grassroots social activism and theories have not died in the United States, but they have instead been survived by the native religious institutions key to American identity. So what does this all mean? If working class values are so intertwined with religious identity, a proper labor movement by necessity has to originate through the grassroots of religious groups. As opposed to the Bakuninist and Stirnerist mindset of religion as a force of oppression and conservatism, perhaps it can be the organic force of freedom in a secular, decedent and liberal capitalist society.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Is America fertile ground for a faith and grassroots community workers' movement?"}

I'm going to make some sweeping statements here for the sake of not writing a book, so please bear with me.\n\nAnarchists, especially anti-civ folks, like to hold up older tribes with more egalitarian organization structures as some kind of argument for anarchism being human nature, and maybe even an argument that we all need to abandon modern society and go live in huts and only talk to the 50 other people living next door.\n\nI have two main issues with this. First, while many of tribes were more egalitarian in their structure, they still maintained soft hierarchies around things like family and age and gender, and both Gelderloos [and others](https://www.eurozine.com/change-course-human-history/) have offered strong evidence that family can be the starting point of social hierarchies and state formation.\n\nSecondly, and more importantly, while these tribes may have been more egalitarian internally, they still maintained strong ideas of tribal identity and strong ideas of ingroup/outgroup. If you pull back from just looking at one tribe, you find a bunch of people who have no problem raiding or killing other people because they are an Other.

Prior convictions are being stripped away, trials of fire are an every day occurrence, and soon a new ideological ecosystem will emerge. Like most complex systems, it seems to go from people beginning to lose their identity, rapidly spinning into chaos, having that chaos begin to oscillate between a few stable regions until it finally settles into a new form. To me at least, it seems like a bunch of affiliations have migrated, swelled, or waned in the past couple years and I'm curious if we can get some consensus on exactly what has happened. A couple trends I have noticed:\n\n* \"Anarcho\"-Capitalism as a tendency has thank god taken off its mask and put on a white hood, and are now at least honestly identifying as Fascists. I don't see *any*one using this term anymore\n\n* Libertarian has had a split, with some going down the anarcho-capitalist pipeline thats been around for a while and ending up as fascists, others have grouped together in opposition to this group as people who think killing minorities is bad (but killing poor minorities is still a-ok, because they're poor)\n\n*  Neoliberalism as an ideology has dissolved as well, splintering int post-neoliberal paleoconservatives who are fascists in all but name, and into people who somehow love Bill Clinton now?\n\n*  Centrism (read: moderate right) now has its extremists. Yes, there are extreme centrists. These are the people who blame everyone besides Hillary Clinton for Hillary Clinton losing the election. Bernie sanders was some extremist communist populist, and people who would have preferred Biden are chauvinist conservatives. Don't ask me, at least the fascists are genuine about their bad faith. \n\n* Following the momentum of Bernie Sanders, there actually seems to be a sizeable chunk of people who even I would call Leftist. These people have dropped the 'Crony Capitalist' schtick and finally see that 'A balance of socialism and capitalism' is like asking for a balance of eating a bowl of cereal and getting attacked by a porcupine. Incredibly pro-union, these people can be frustrating at times but are more than willing to learn and drifting further left with much momentum: I've seen people go from learning Sweden!=Socialism into recommending people read Conquest of Bread in a matter of weeks. \n\n* Progressives have been the same flavor-of-the-week whatever they've always been. This week it seems like they are worshipping GWB's 'Ethics' lawyer of all people as the bastion of progressive thought. These people annoy the hell out of me even more so than fascists and have an even more ridiculous headcanon to boot. Their love of re-writing the past is rivalled only by their white-hot burning passion of spending 10 minutes voting some time in November.\n\n* Radicals for the most part have entered a chronic state of semantic satiation from uttering the phrase \"I told you so\" so many times it has lost meaning. We have temporary withdrawn from politics to deal with this pressing medical issue through a treatment protocol consisting of heavy amounts of booze and/or heroin.

Moreover, I am positing that this reliance directly contradicts the assertion that capitalist modes of organization and production would be better off without a state or state-like organization intervening on their behalf.\n\nThe scenario I am building accepts a few basic assumptions that takes both left- and right-libertarian beliefs for granted:\n\n* Wage-work will continue to exist.\n* Absentee ownership of capital and land will continue to exist.\n* The existence of the prior two will imply a landless class who depends on a wage to maintain access to their homes and the means for sustaining healthy lives (healthcare, food, clean water, etc.).\n* Firearms are likely to be in the possession of most individuals.\n* Worker organization would be ubiquitous.\n\nImagine, in our scenario, that we have an approximation of what anti-State/no-State capitalists envision. Landlords control swaths of land which are rented out to a wage seeking class, and armed squads which function as \"justice agencies\" are part of the social norm. Without a state to extract wealth from a captive population and funnel it into property enforcement mechanisms (like the police or sheriff), landlords would invariably come to rely on the justice agencies to serve eviction notices and enforce them. So long as the tenant continues to pay rent, the system runs smoothly without disruption.\n\nBut what happens when the tenants can no longer find a wage, or find a wage that will give them enough to at least sate the demands of the landlord? Given the proclivity of humans to say \"fuck it\" and ignore their problems when they are staring them in the face, they'd just continue living their lives and not pay the rent. The landlord turns to his contracted \"justice agency\" to come up with a ruling-- is their failure to pay rent justified? What ought to be done about it, if anything? The worker, in their defense, argues they have paid enough, the landlord is not being placed in a position which would bring them to abject poverty, and eviction is disproportionate to failure to pay in any case... And even if the judge rules against them, they're not leaving unless you force them out.\n\nIt is not unreasonable to assume the \"justice agency\" would rule in the favor of the landlord, in spite of the workers argument from proportionality, if only out of sheer self-interest, and I think there is no argument here that humans tend to prefer interest-maximizing behavior and arrangements; the entire vision of capitalism hinges on accepting this premise. It's also totally rational behavior given the parameters, and doesn't even require that any parties involved be corrupt.\n\nConsider the alternative: if they ruled in favor of the rent strikers, it would send two really strong market signals: 1.) their clientele of landlords can not depend on them to rule favorably on matters of ownership and 2.) that \"justice agencies\" (or at least this justice agency) are toothless, and will roll over at the hint of a rent strike, worker occupation, or other act of popular expropriation. This would be extraordinarily bad for them if they planned on staying in business for very long. One might argue \"but maybe they would rule in favor of the tenant\", but I find it difficult to believe this wouldn't be the exception, and not the norm; a society that rules in favor of the tenant on the regular renders the central question at hand moot.\n\nSo the \"justice agency\" is now tasked with enforcing an eviction-- they must send a squad of armed people in order to remove someone from their home. But there is something to consider: I imagine if the society of State-less capitalism is anything like the Free State Project, guns will be in abundance, and even the unemployed will have guns. (You might feel compelled to suggest you will do something like \"change the locks when they leave\", but this trivializes the seriousness of a rent strike with armed participants, and is totally inadequate.) The justice agency has to worry about the cost of going into a house to remove armed occupants who do not want to be removed. On a lark, what would you, the reader, have to be paid to evict an armed family from a home? An apartment complex under siege? Would you do it on a house-per-house basis, or would you want a lump sum up front?\n\nWhichever you choose, I imagine the premium for violence would be very high, and this cost would necessarily be borne upon the landlord, because there isn't a state to offset the *cost of evictions* via the sheriff. The costs for evictions will be high, so the landlord would be pressured to engage in two interest-maximizing behaviors of their own: select a justice agency which has ruled favorably on matters of ownership similar to the landlords views in the past and arrange for a payment schedule to the enforcing justice agency. Again, there is nothing corrupt about this *prima facie* and is perfectly acceptable within virtually every \"stateless capitalist\" model, but the moral hazard should be evident. It simply assumes each party will act rationally and persue interest maximizing behavior.\n\nWithout corruption on anyone's part, it would come full circle to something similar to our current social and economic arrangements today, with a slight adjustment as to the bureaucratic mechanisms upon which they operate. Landlords extract wealth from a renting population, passing on the costs of enforcement to their tenants, who are ceded no power in the bargaining process-- they are obliged to pay for an ownership arrangement that could very well put them out of a home if they are suddenly unable to pay.\n\nMy own personal conclusion has been that the more consistent libertarian position - a **thick libertarian** position - is that all such arrangements are objectionable, and a more libertarian order would acknowledge that absentee ownership (and by extension, most forms of property) is loaded with too much authoritarianism (and really, any authoritarianism is too much), and can't survive without something approximating a state. Bearing this in mind, a consistent libertarian would be equally opposed to a private quasi-state as they would a state built on dictat.\n\nGiven the above scenario, do you understand the repulsion and skepticism left libertarians/libertarian socialists have for propertarianism, broadly speaking? Do you acknowledge that at the very least, there is an extremely obvious means for it to degenerate into an authoritarian arrangement even if everything starts off copacetic? If not, what is your reasoning? If so, but you still defend this sort of order, why?\n","subreddit":"CapitalismVSocialism","title":"AnCaps/AntiStatists/\"Voluntaryists\", I'd like your input on a given thought experiment.""num_comments":0,"score":3,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"u/GhostOfDanielShays gives their take on anarcho-capitalism"}

The pharmaceutical industry, the American Medical Association, large Healthcare Systems, and other groups who stand to profit off peoples' pain have been making the rules, manufacturing diagnoses, manipulating medical students into believing lies about evidence (or lack thereof), adding unnecessary procedures, and artificially skyrocketing costs for far too long. If something does not change, within about 20 years 100% of our current taxes as Americans will be devoted to healthcare while health itself is actually getting worse for the average American. What we are really doing is taking out our wallets and handing it to rich doctors and businessmen who are quite happy to fool the masses into thinking it's all worth it. \n\nThere are many others like me who work in this industry who are willing to provide our services at a much reduced cost while avoiding the oppressive systems which keep people from useful services rather than providing them. This is all because the system has been created by these powerful people - necessitating the right diagnostic criteria, documentation, and endless strings of consults which essentially exist to make navigating the system too esoteric for most people to be able to see it clearly for what it is.\n\nIf one thing has become evident from Donald Trump being President, it's that our \"government\" is not a central agency, but rather an amalgamation of various powerful interests. The healthcare industry CANNOT be changed from within or via Washington. The powers must be dismantled. We must stand up as a people and say that enough is enough. We DEMAND the right to seek alternative treatments if we cannot afford or do not benefit from the current system. We DEMAND the right to choose which harms we do or do not accept for our own bodies. We DEMAND the right to alter our consciousness if we have determined that it is of benefit to us. We DEMAND the right to our own beliefs, which can and should include the right to question the diagnoses endorsed with almost religious fervor from the AMA, APA, and other organizations. We DEMAND the right to seek and use knowledge outside of the established academic settings. \n\nThis cannot be done alone. We have the power as a people to stop this dead in its tracks, but we must look beyond what we each stand to benefit from this. We must be willing to go to jail or lose money for these beliefs. We must start doing it without asking for permission from those who will never give this permission to us. Now, who is with me?","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Real Revolution in Healthcare"}

However, this kind of behaviour is harmful to people from opressed nationalities for a couple reasons:\n\n-It ignores why natlib is a thing in the first place. It is due to cultural erasure fucking over peoples lifes in a way that erases a part of their identity, by forcing them to adopt a different language, customs, etc. It is an axis of opression, just like patriarchy or racism are. \n\n-It confuses nationalism of the elite with nationalism of the opressed. The elites of a particular state, to ensure an unifying factor and avoid rebellions choose one nation to lead their state. Thus, their nationalism is inherently bad as it marginalizes minorities and often act imperialistically if it's a state with the capacity to do so. Mistaking that with the laments of people who have their culture stolen to be who they are is a huge mistake, and only serves to alienate them from our cause. They deserve freedom, just like lgbt and people of colour do.\n\n-Natlib is not, in any way, a desire to claim supremacy. It is a desire to be free from imposition.\n\nThe anarchists who hate on natlib are mostly Americans, and that is understandable given that in the USA native nations are opressed in \"reserves\" and are an exiguous minority, while whites who make up most of the population don't see them often in their day to day life. What they see is an aggresive and imperialistic patriotism propugnated by the elites to serve as an unifying factor and control them. This leads many, mostly, white American Anarchist to hate on anything that resembles nationalism, no matter the nature of it. Anarchists in Europe though are often far more comprehensive with it due to bigger contact with opressed nationalities, like Catalans, Basques, Scots, Bretons, etc (and no the current mess in Catalonia is not natlib either I'm not saying that).\n\n\n\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"A note on natlib"}

{"author":"Anarcho_Humanist","created_utc":1527182466,"num_comments":5,"score":18,"selftext":"A particularly remarkable network of autonomous villages can be found in the mountains around Itoiz, in Navarra, part of the Basque country. The oldest of these, Lakabe, has been occupied for twenty-eight years as of this writing, and is home to about thirty people. A project of love, Lakabe challenges and changes the traditional aesthetic of rural poverty. The floors and walkways are beautiful mosaics of stone and tile, and the newest house to be built there could pass for the luxury retreat of a millionaire \u2014 except that it was built by the people who live there, and designed in harmony with the environment, to catch the sun and keep out the cold. Lakabe houses a communal bakery and a communal dining room, which on a normal day hosts delicious feasts that the whole village eats together.\n\nAnother of the villages around Itoiz, Aritzkuren, exemplifies a certain aesthetic that represents another idea of history. Thirteen years ago, a handful of people occupied the village, which had been abandoned for over fifty years before that. Since then, they have constructed all their dwellings within the ruins of the old hamlet. Half of Aritzkuren is still ruins, slowly decomposing into forest on a mountainside an hour\u2019s drive from the nearest paved road. The ruins are a reminder of the origin and foundation of the living parts of the village, and they serve as storage spaces for building materials that will be used to renovate the rest of it. The new sense of history that lives amidst these piled stones is neither linear nor amnesiac, but organic \u2014 in that the past is the shell of the present and compost of the future. It is also post-capitalist, suggesting a return to the land and the creation of a new society in the ruins of the old.\n\nUli, another of the abandoned and reoccupied villages, disbanded after more than a decade of autonomous existence; but the success rate of all the villages together is encouraging, with five out of six still going strong. The \u201cfailure\u201d of Uli demonstrates another advantage of anarchist organizing: a collective can dissolve itself rather than remaining stuck in a mistake forever or suppressing individual needs to perpetuate an artificial collectivity. These villages in their prior incarnations, a century earlier, were only dissolved by the economic catastrophe of industrializing capitalism. Otherwise, their members were held fast by a conservative kinship system rigidly enforced by the church.\n\nAt Aritzkuren as at other autonomous villages throughout the world, life is both laborious and relaxed. The residents must build all their infrastructure themselves and create most of the things they need with their own hands, so there is plenty of work to do. People get up in the morning and work on their own projects, or else everyone comes together for a collective effort decided on at a previous meeting. Following a huge lunch which one person cooks for everyone on a rotating basis, people have the whole afternoon to relax, read, go into town, work in the garden, or fix up a building. Some days, nobody works at all; if one person decides to skip a day, there are no recriminations, because there are meetings at which to make sure responsibilities are evenly distributed. In this context, characterized by a close connection to nature, inviolable individual freedom mixed with a collective social life, and the blurring of work and pleasure, the people of Aritzkuren have created not only a new lifestyle, but an ethos compatible with living in an anarchist society.\n\nThe school they are building at Aritzkuren is a powerful symbol of this. A number of children live at Aritzkuren and the other villages. Their environment already provides a wealth of learning opportunities, but there is much desire for a formal educational setting and a chance to employ alternative teaching methods in a project that can be accessible to children from the entire region.\n\nAs the school indicates, the autonomous villages violate the stereotype of the hippy commune as an escapist attempt to create a utopia in microcosm rather than change the existing world. Despite their physical isolation, these villages are very much involved in the outside world and in social movements struggling to change it. The residents share their experiences in creating sustainable collectives with other anarchist and autonomous collectives throughout the country. Many people divide each year between the village and the city, balancing a more utopian existence with participation in ongoing struggles. The villages also serve as a refuge for activists taking a break from stressful city life. Many of the villages carry on projects that keep them involved in social struggles; for example, one autonomous village in Italy provides a peaceful setting for a group that translates radical texts. Likewise, the villages around Itoiz have been a major part of the twenty-year-running resistance to the hydroelectric dam there.\n\nFor about ten years, starting with the occupation of Rala, near Aritzkuren, the autonomous villages around Itoiz have created a network, sharing tools, materials, expertise, food, seeds, and other resources. They meet periodically to discuss mutual aid and common projects; residents of one village will drop by another to eat lunch, talk, and, perhaps, deliver a dozen extra raspberry plants. They also participate in annual gatherings that bring together autonomous communities from all over Spain to discuss the process of building sustainable collectives. At these, each group presents a problem it has been unable to resolve, such as sharing responsibilities or putting consensus decisions into practice. Then they each offer to mediate while another collective discusses their problem \u2014 preferably a problem the mediating group has experience resolving.\n\n[From anarchyinaction.org which cites Anarchy Works]","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Peter Gelderloos on the Itoiz villages."}

Then i read some general criticism of capitalism a la **das capital** and it made a lot of sense and steered me in a definite anticapitalist direction. Then kropotkin got involved and subreddits like /r/completeanarchy and /r/anarchism and i got a pretty solid anarcho communust stance.\n\nAnyway I'm really really fed up with the general lack of activism in anarchist circles. Most anarchists i see preach the eventual revolution that makes the great communist utopia and like punching nazis but do nothing else? \n\nI mean historically revolutions weren't very successful unless there was a crisis, war, famine etc and people don't see a way except a revolution. Like the majority of people wouldn't accept change and would rather have the old system. Furthermore most anarchists punch nazis and preach revolution with an unclear goal or progress and that makes people think negatively on an eventual anarchist revolution that probably won't happen anyways.\n\nSo what I've been thinking about a lot lately is how anarchist praxis can be changed into a positive progressive force that can actually gain supporters and actually topple capitalism and the state. \n\nBookchin's idea about municipalism is great imo, way more likely to work than a revolution or insurrection. Plus with all of us talking about googling bookchin I'd be expecting a lot of worker cooperatives to pop up but no?\n\nAnyway I'm thinking a good anarchist tactic is to oppose fascism by any means, protest for worker rights, break laws to send a message, and most importantly, unionise and gather people to open up worker coops with the sole intent of outcompeting businesses and attracting workers to join! Also a well run coop would spread the idea of a more democratic free society far better than anything else! \n\nLike the only actually good coop I've seen is mondragon, why aren't there more coops everywhere? There are certainly enough of us right now.\n\nLike what I'm saying is our perspective needs to change in that direction if we want to actually change society for the better.\n\n\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Discussion time!

Have a read!\n\nThe Federation of Neighborhood Councils-El Alto (acronym: Fejuve; Spanish: Federaci\u00f3n de Juntas Vecinales de El Alto) is a federation of over 600 neighborhood councils that provide public services, construction and jobs to citizens of El Alto, Bolivia. It has been praised as a large, functioning example of an urban anarchist society.[1]\n\n1      History\n\n2\tGovernment\n\n3\tEconomy\n\n4\tLaw and Order\n\n5\tReferences\n\nHistory\n\nThe first council was created in 1957 and was based off the traditional practices of the Aymara people and the need to respond to widespread poverty, corruption and violence throughout Bolivia and El Alto. Fejuve itself was created in 1979 after a mass meeting of neighbourhood councils decided to create an alliance. Since then, Fejuve has grown to be on par with the city government.[2]\n\nGovernment\n\nCouncils have around 200 members that meet once a month and make decisions through discussion and consensus. Political party leaders, merchants, real estate speculators, and those who collaborated with the dictatorship are not allowed to be delegates between councils. The councils have been successful in blocking the Bolivian government's plan to privatise natural gas and water reserves, introduce new taxes and have been successful in creating the cities first public university.[1]\n\nEconomy\n\nThe economy of Fejuve resembles syndicalism and mutualism in that there is a high degree of worker's self-management and common ownership despite operating in a very localised market economy. Councils are also able to pull together resources to build parks, schools, clinics, housing, cooperatives and install water connections, sewerage outlets, electrical cables and garbage collection services to fill the hole that the state and private sector have left.[3]\n\nLaw and Order\n\nIn response to the violence and corruption of Bolivia's state police, Fejuve has created its own justice system. Councils act as mediators between minor disputes with neighbours and practice a degree of restorative justice based upon traditional Aymaran customs. Communities also form collective self-defense groups which are known to execute thieves, rapists and murders whilst hanging dolls outside of the houses of victims as a warning to any future attackers.[2]\n\nReferences\n\n Gelderloos, Peter (2010).

A long while ago, I had an idea for a list of examples of Socialism that we could show to liberals and others, who claim that \"Socialism has never worked\". I posted the beginnings of that list here, and elsewhere on leftist Reddit, and it has since grown and changed quite a bit. So, I figured it might be a good idea to ask for some additional feedback on the list, to see what people think of it, and get some suggestions on how to improve it. I got a lot of great feedback here the first time around, so I hope to get some of that again. \n\nI tried to be as non-sectarian as possible. Examples range from large scale societies, down to smaller city and town communes. For an example to be added to the list, it's looked at on case by case basis.
