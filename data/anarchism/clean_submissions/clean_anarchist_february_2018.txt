That if, as Murray Bookchin would call them, lifestyle Anarchists were the only type of Anarchism with any semblance of a movement in my city. \nSo I went to meetings, I learned that there were few Anarchists in my city, a group of at most thirty-five(at least those who were part of the groups I discovered) that we're actively doing things. \nIn the first meeting (which took place in an office building, which is also used as a meeting and planning place for the local transgender community) I brought up Murray Bookchin, communialism, libertarian municipalism,my issues with marxism, my realization that unions are adaptive (not revolutionary, at least in America) as well as Rojava. Two of the group knew what I was talking about. One older lady took notes and seemed to take what I was saying seriously. Which was refreshing, to finally find some people who knew anything about the problems which so often occupy my mind. So I stayed for the meeting and found an interesting as well as lively discussion about Anarchism, socialism, different propaganda projects, different community outreach programs, learned about the local food not bombs chapter, the radical mental health collective and other various things which my memory does not serve me to recall in explicit detail.\n\nSo after the meeting I decided that I would return. I figured that I could add something to this small collective of individuals.\n\nAfter further investigation and thought I found several things wrong in the movement which i had joined, but also several things very right.\n\nI'll begin with what I found wrong. The group lacked any sense of a coherent ideology. Nothing outside of the vaguest notions of Anarchism. Which from questioning several of my now comrades I could conclude. There were individualists, whom I am vehemently critical. There were anarcho-communists, who I sometimes agreed with. There were crypto-currency fanatics who I will never take seriously. There were even people who spoke highly of state socialism, honestly I don't know why they were in Anarchist circles to begin with. There were people who echoed the old Proudhon notion of,\"Archy or anarchy\" when I gave support for the idea of direct democracy.\nWhat I realized was that the reason this had happened was because there was no outlet for education on anarchism. No real goals besides, protest this here, have a prayer for world peace there, meet up here, watch this movie, read this book, chain your self to this rock, hold signs. Etc.\nWhat I found was in fact a concern for creating spectacles, and less concern for serious organization, serious development of identity, serious concern with art and it's propaganda benefits, or even serious ideology.\n\nThe reason I even mention these things is because of where we are at historically. The\"alt-right\" is a global force now days. There are serious calls for white ethno states. Serious calls for \"ethnic cleansing' and serious people asking \"the Jewish question\" critical resistance to these developments needs to go further then the black block. We need to go further than just punching nazis. We need to offer a real alternative to the alternative right. We need to understand that if we don't, we will all be sent to the camps. This is a dire situation. The alternative right has been beat back for the moment, but believe me, they are regrouping.\n\nNow some positive feedback. What I found in my local Anarchist movement was that there was a real sense of comradeship. That we were in this together. What I found most compelling was the food not bombs chapter. Three times a week, we would make food for the local homeless population. It has gotten to the point now that the police are trying to repress us, now. I won't go to far into that. \nFood not bombs is a definite step in the right direction. So much so that the reactionary police have felt the need to try and stop us. They haven't, but they are trying.\n\nNow what I really want to talk about, the Kurdish criticism of American Anarchist art. Namely punk rock music.\nI love punk rock, but the Kurdish have a serious criticism to relate to us. Namely that punk rock isn't striving for musical excellency. That punk rock too shares in spectacles, rather than artistic excellency. Now I refuse to give up on our punk rock culture. Maybe I'm a little bit sentimental. Maybe I truly love the sound.\nSo being a musical artist as well as an Anarchist thinker, I decided that this would be one of my contributions to the movement.\nSo in response to Kurdish calling our punk rock wack I present my e.p. ,\"radical Rhapsody\"\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QaavT3F9Bvw\n\nIt is my synthesis of seriously considered musicianship. A serious consideration of Anarchist philosophy. And a serious revaluation of what \"punk rock\" could mean.\n\ntl;dr u/Rojava_plan after the nazi torch rally gave some criticism of the moment in the United States. I decided to actually join the movement and see if they were right. Somewhat, I conclude. One of the main criticisms of the moment in the united states was that our anarchism movement had low quality music. I worked for months on an E.P. to try and play a part in changing that.\nEdit.

It's our site/blog and the link directs to our manifesto, about who we are, what are we doing and why we were formed in the first place. This site is also used as a newsfeed about anarchist/communist prisoners, presecuted militants and prison struggles. Unfortunately most of it it's in Greek. We're a collective similar to AnarchistBlackCross in a way.\n\nWe're currently supporting about 36 politcal/social prisoners, you can find more info about them [here](http://tameio.net/en/addresses/). This support is ethical, political and economical. The reason why I write this post is about the economical aspect, with which we're having issues. Economical support for the imprisoned militants means that steadily, every month we send them a set amout of money to cover their expenses in prison so they can \"survive\" in there. 36 comrades * some hunders of \u20ac = lots of thousands each month. And as you may know the general situation in Greece is abit hard...\n\nAnother financial part of the solidarity fund is to cover expenses that various comrades have with court/legal fees etc.\n\nAs you many understand finding that many thousands of \u20ac each month is REALLY a hard task here. That's why we're thinking if there are any online platforms that could help us with that.\n\nI've found out about [Firefund](https://www.firefund.net/). Does anyone has experience with that?\n\nAlso and most importantly, are you aware of any other ways-platforms that could fund money for our cause? Was thinking if there is something like a \"radical politcal\" [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/), like a platform that people can steadily/monthly contribute an amount of money.\n\nThank you, any questions or help is welcome.\n\nA personal iniative from a member.\n\n'Till we are all free...","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Solidarity Fund for prisoners and persecuted militants from Greece.

I've tried to familiarize myself with the core philosophies and main criticisms. Anarchists, especially the well read ones, stand out from all other political parties in one way. It's the one thing that makes me keep coming back, wanting to learn more.  \n\nYou guys actually care. About each other, about strangers and even people that actively hate you. You aren't interested in \"getting the better\" of your \"opponents\" and you aren't competing in some abstract political game. You value real things - food, safety, freedom, happiness. You are willing to sacrifice modern \"luxuries\" to stand by your principles. You are the most honest people I know and you seem to suffer the most for it. \n\nI've never been to a protest or done anything typically associated with anarchists. I would love nothing more than to be a part of the community and do something of any value, but I live in the midwest in a rural area. I'm not in college and the interests of people my age seem to be in getting fucked up at raves/bars/parties etc and not talking about anything going on in the world. I don't think I'm smarter than any of these kids, they are all talented at something and surely read as much as me, but they don't really care about the world or society. I can see their eyes roll when \"the issues\" come up and they tend to spit out generic phrases like \"just live and let live man\". Worse yet are the uptight types, the no nonsense office jockey that assures you hard work will secure *you* a decent future. Don't get dragged down with all the have-nots, after all.

All mod actions are reversible and flagrant abuses of mod power will be dealt with by community consensus.\n\nI hate to create drama, but this whole thing has left me pretty upset because I enjoyed posting there and I think my ban was totally unjustified. I was banned for questioning the rules and have linked proof further down in the post. In my opinion, the censorship of folks who're not using slurs, doxing, openly espousing fascism, going against Reddit rules (which could lead to subs being banned) or clearly trolling in online anarchist spaces is an issue anarchists ought to engage with. Obviously mods have a final say in who gets to post on their sub, but that doesn't mean they can't be called out for making exclusionary choices and bringing personal issues into their moderation practices.\n\n/r/DebateAnarchism recently came out with a rule that posts must be short, which I vehemently disagree with. All posts on /r/DebateAnarchism must be approved by the moderation team. I had previously made several extremely lengthy posts there, all of which were quickly approved [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/7bkzeh/against_the_price_mechanism/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/7oyqrm/why_market_agnosticism_is_incompatible_with/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/6y6hkg/private_property_vs_personal_property/) [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/6vwabj/entitlement_and_merit/). \nHere are some examples of posts that were longer than mine or come close in /r/debateanarchism history, [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/6rmsli/ama_anarchist_synthesis/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/6rmsli/ama_anarchist_synthesis/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/6di4jw/neoproudhonian_anarchismmutualism_ama/) [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/6c1slm/my_assertion_anarcho_capitalism_is_not_coherent/) [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/6gcnvv/anticivilization_ama/) [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/6lu8c1/occult_and_anarchism_ama_with_dr_bones/) [7](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnarchism/comments/65zlbd/can_we_get_back_to_actual_antifa/). Funnily enough all these very long posts were also the most upvoted, all I had to do was filter out the top posts over the past year. Historically, nobody (the users and the mods) seemed to mind that some posts were long. \n\nIn most debates, one side proposes an argument to which the other side responds. The length of the argument is usually irrelevant to the ensuing discourse and it's up to the reader whether or not they want to engage with a lengthy position. The post I was trying to make questioned whether egoism is a prescriptive framework, it was 736 words long and was very much to the point. Some of the length came from defining words and providing examples. I attempted to post multiple times and altered the title to make it more clear.\n\n[Here are two screenshots of the brief discourse that got me banned](https://imgur.com/gallery/JIDWT). The mod said \"Save your wall of text for the comments.\" Why does it matter whether my argument is in the comments or in the body of the post? I put a fair amount of time into writing the post and I was pretty upset that I couldn't post the whole thing in the body, which is why I responded a few times.\n\nI'm calling our /u/pnoque for reactionary moderation and borderline censorship. Merely questioning the rules shouldn't be punishable with a ban. Moreover, a sub with an explicitly anarchist affiliation should do better than blindly enforcing rules, especially seeing as those rules are utter garbage. Professing anarchist ideals while banning people for questioning rules is pretty rich, at least /r/fullcommunism mods aren't hypocrites.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"I was censored from /r/DebateAnarchism on arbitrary grounds"}

I think that we need to focus on something greater than ourselves.  I would love to see all people unite to fix our social diseases, our planet, and grow old as a species.  Maybe I'm too starry eyed and hopeful for this,  but I'd like to see us take to the stars and be the absolute pinnacle of our best that humanity can be. I think that this hope can be realized in this day and age if we collectively choose to throw off the shackles of avarice and selfishness and embrace the needs of others before the wants of ourselves. In this time in our history,  we have a way to unite people like never before because of communication. We have ways to change hearts and minds through the belief in something real,  and bigger than ourselves.  We should choose to believe in making a global community that sees everyone as people with the ability to love, and the need to be loved.  I'm not a religious man, but surely there must be a way to connect that simple ideal that seems to be stated in most world religions to have compassion for each other. I don't understand why we don't.  It just seems so simple to me. Yes,  there are despicable people in this world,  but maybe the world kind of made them that way a little bit.  Shouldn't we try to understand that line of thinking,  and try to reason with them,  and uplift them to a better standard? Nobody deserves hatred right off the bat, so why is it that there's so much racism,  and homophobia, and xenophobia? Are we so terrified of losing one identity,  and not grasping that we can gain a better one?

I think it's an important topic for discussion as it can give us clues as to what kinds of people, when exposed to anarchist ideas, are likely to be receptive to them. That said, here's my story.\n\nWhen I reached the age to start seriously caring about politics (high school age circa 2000) I started out on the left wing of the Democratic Party. I probably would have been a big Bernie guy if he had been a nationally-known figure back then. I was a staunch liberal and die-hard partisan Democrat.\n\nI flirted with right-wing \"libertarianism\" very briefly in college, until I realized that the whole extreme pro-capitalism thing just wasn't who I was. I always knew I didn't like capitalism, but I wasn't sure why, or even what capitalism was, much less what any alternative might be. I knew essentially nothing of the far left apart from the caricature of the far left as Stalinism. So, there was for me nowhere else to \"go.\"\n\nThroughout the 2000s and early 2010s, I was always frustrated and disappointed at how spineless Democrats were, ideologically, rhetorically, and tactically. Chomsky was the one radical figure I knew of, who I had first heard of in college, though I didn't know exactly what his ideology was other than that he was \"radical.\" I remember thinking, 'Damn, Republicans call Democrats traitors for being insufficiently warmongering, they'd have a coronary if they heard what Chomsky has to say.'\n\nI guess I discovered anarchism through Chomsky. About 5 years ago I became consciously aware of anarchism as a distinct and coherent worldview, and I've never gone back to being merely progressive. For a couple of years in between I was very impressed with Marx's work and thought of myself as more of an anti-authoritarian communist who wanted to discover what Marx really believed in, and also at that same time lapsed into more reformist/electoral tendencies. The one thing I have to give Donald Trump credit for is making me a revolutionary anarchist again. Before the 2016 election I didn't really understand the need for militant direct action, thinking that the state might be able to bring us closer to anti-capitalist ends if we played our cards right. It kind of dawned upon me throughout 2017 when I rediscovered Bakunin that what I believed in was indistinguishable from anarchism.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"What were you politically before you became an anarchist?"}

The journey has been fairly long and went from a hopeful Leninist to spiraling into anarchism. \n\nI never really talked about my own politics with others, but as of the past 2 years I met one person in this suburban hell I could deem trustworthy enough to talk to about politics and just shooting the shit about memes and pissing around about how hopeless everything was. \n\nWe would talk about dumb shit constantly, and I slowly egged him from the upper left corner to drift a bit further down, even though I could still have a good discussion on theory and critiques with him even if he was still a ML.\n\nI was never too social, as I couldn't relate to others, choosing instead to stick to my own interests and what not. I could really relate with this dude since we acted as foils to each other, both having similar related interests and hobbies. I don't expect middle school kids to be as well read on theory or anything like that, but god damn, it felt like we were the only kids on campus who knew what the fuck was going on. And I hated thinking that because of how stupid and elitist it was. \n\nHell, we were just kids, I'm still just a kid.

I have a good academic record so the teachers are usually alright with me just kicking back and listening to music during class, since I try to opt out of group projects and partner work when possible and they let me.\n\nBut I can't just discuss politics or foreign policy or identity politics with my biology teacher, civics teacher, or my CT teacher.\n\nI can still make it through but I'm just so fucking *tired* and *hopeless*.

For fucks sake, a police officer came in to give a presentation on fucking *bullying and suicide*. First thing they ask the class, \"Who do you think is the most bullied person in the world at any moment?\" Some kids say nerds, overweight people, black people. Police officer answers, \"Well they don't notice it because they're thick skinned, but it's white male police officers.\" That shit didn't even fucking faze me, I wanted to laugh in his face and tell him he's a fucking idiot pig. But he's the one with a badge and a gun and I'm just a scared kid, right? It fucking depresses me every fucking day to know that people like him roam the streets every fucking day and kill innocents, and what the fuck can I do about it? I can spout endless memes about anarchism and encourage people to become more than democrats or why the republican party isn't in your interests, but what is one voice in a sea of people? I had a fucking panic attack just fucking arguing with some kid who thought welfare allowed you to sit on your ass all day. Boy, I sure do wish my parents knew that.

What am I going to be able to do for Food Not Bombs? Am I just going to lose it, drop out of high school, and speed my way into the White House only to be shot down? I've always had a problem with hopelessness and fatalism, but I've already fallen off that cliff, and I haven't seen or felt a bottom for years.

We easily escaped our school after checking in and found ourselves doing school work for about 2 hours at the local coffee shop. We then decided to get food at a near by chain and then head back to school because we still had 2 classes that we had to go to. \n\nOn the way back about 150 yds from the school I see a cop car and think to myself that we're screwed. He stops his patrol car and hops out to confront us. He asks us some info like where we're going and who we are. The conversation eventually dissolves into him getting our school info and I lie to him about having an off campus pass to maybe save my ass. He asks my friend for the same info as he nervously answers I contemplate how bad this could end up. I figure worst that happens is I get a Friday school (2 hour detention after school). \n\nHe lets us go and we proceed to walk to the school to get to our next classes as he checks out the authenticity of my info. We reach the stop light before the school which is about 40 yds from the school. I see the cop pull up to the left turn lane and think nothing much of it cause I assume he's just checking random students walking around since it's lunch time and some students are allowed to leave with an off campus period instead of a class. Just as the light turns green and we're allowed to use the cross walk he turns on his lights flips a U-turn and yells stop as he gets out of his patrol car. I have that \"oh shit\" moment and feel that this situation is about to get way worse. \n\nHe proceeds to tell us to take our backpacks off and tells us to put our hands behind our backs. In a serious tone I ask if he's being serious and in a stern manner he says yes. I ask him what he's arresting us for and he replies **Daytime Loitering**. In disbelief I start smiling cause I can belief he's handcuffing two minors for a minor infraction. As soon as he cuffs us he  pats us down and proceeds to read us our rights. In the middle of this a car full of Jackass Seniors go by in a car taking video of us getting arrested(They would end up posting this on snapchat  and the whole school found out we're getting arrested faster than I could count to 10. \n\nWe get put in the back of that repulsive patrol car and are taken back to school in full show to our peers. As we pull up to school in handcuffs a mass of kids waited outside the school for us to be pulled out from the car in handcuffs and taken into the office to be punished for our criminal acts. Luckily one of the campus security guards is a homie and made everyone put away their phones. He takes us out of the car and takes off our cuffs in the front of the school in full view of faculty, parents picking up their kids and students. The officer made a point to publicly shame us in front of everyone we knew. \n\nWe get taken into the office and given our school punishments. Only a Friday school and a phone call home(luckily no one immediately answered. But after the admin gives us the summary of what we did and how we could've easily been killed or raped or murdered or  sex trafficked Officer Barbrady (south park reference) informs us that we have to write an essay and possible intervention program to prevent this from going on our juvenile record. \n\nTo summarize I was publicly humiliated, hand cuffed, arrested and charged, and possibly have to serve in an intervention program for ditching school for 3 hours (which I was coming back to so I could go to actual classes). No doubt I'm in the wrong here but I feel that my punishment might be harsh considering what I actually did. I haven't been able to focus all week at school since all I can hear at school is people mocking me for my run in with the law. \n\nThanks Officer\n\ntl;dr\nI ditched a school assembly. Got caught by a cop and now I'm facing a possible juvenile record and have been publicly shamed in an effort to \"scare me straight\" but in all reality it just pissed me off and taught me to hate government and their bullshit.

The distribution of wealth is drastically advantageous to the wealthy 1%, and dishonest to the other 99% of the working class. There have been countless wars over many unnecessary conflicts regarding economic and territorial gain.\nCorruption is a prominent controversy. There are many evident weaknesses in the political systems utilized around the World today in the form of embezzlement, lobbying, patronage, and bribery. \nIn Democratic Communism, we, the People, would incorporate Socialistic ideals so that all individuals must work by contributing to society. All are equal, and there is not a hierarchy established by how much materialistic value or political dominance an individual possesses. We would be rewarded by the amount of work we put in towards the benefit of society through the use of the bartering system (food, clothes, absolute necessities) The People must revive the World to the way of nature through the use of windmills, gravity, water pressure, and storing solar energy; this is the healthier alternative than the burning of fossil fuels and pollution. The People must unite to devaluate money, jewelry, and natural resources in order to disallow the on-going violence, corruption, and selfishness over materialistic objects. The hard-working individuals are the upper class, while those who do not work are the lower class.

This book deals with the colonization of Mars, and the subsequent terraforming. It is eerie how often I think of ole Elon Musk while reading. In a nutshell, the colonization starts as a research station, but eventually huge transnational corporations begin taking the planet over, as they have the funds to do so and Earth's governments are facing too many crises to deal with the transnats. This drives many of the original scientists underground to avoid being killed.\n\nAt where I'm at, everyone in the underground is holding a massive congress to come together and resist what is happening on Mars. This is messy, as there are anarchists,  socialists of various stripes, statists, and many cultural groups who decided to go underground for other reasons.

Now that I've begun reading the book, I want to post a follow-up.\n\n&gt; Michael [Marmot] noticed right away a difference between the different rungs on this social ladder. When he talked with the top-level civil servants, they would lean back and take charge of the conversation, demanding to know what Michael wanted. When he talked with the lower-grade civil servants, they would lean forward and wait for him to tell them what to do.\n \n&gt;After years of intensive interviewing, Michael and the team added up the results. It turned out the people at the top of the civil service were four times less likely to have a heart attack than the people at the bottom of the Whitehall ladder. \u2026 If you plotted it on a graph, as your position in the civil service rose, your chances of developing depression fell, step by step. There was a very close relationship between becoming depressed and where you stood in the hierarchy [!]. This is what social scientists call a 'gradient'. 'This is really astonishing', said Michael. 'Why should educated people with good stable jobs have a higher risk of dropping dead [or becoming depressed] than people with a bit more education or slightly higher status jobs?' [pg. 67] ...\n\n&gt; This time, instead of comparing people at the top, middle, and bottom, they compared people within the same civil service band - but whose jobs differed in how much control they had. They wanted to know: Is someone on the middle band more likely to get depressed, or have a heart attack, than another person on the same middle band who has more control? ... What Michael found when he did this was even more striking than the first results... If you worked in the civil service and you had a higher degree of control over your work, you were a lot less likely to become depressed or develop severe emotional distress than people *working at the same pay level, with the same status, in the same office,* as people with a lower degree of control over their work. [pg. 68]\n\nHari's reporting is clear and explicit: the degree of hierarchy, insofar that it determines the extent of control a person has over their work and environment, is equal to the quality of their mental and physical health. The more control a person has, the better their mental and physical health is likely to be; the less control, the worse their mental and physical health is likely to be. He hasn't yet made this point, but the same could be said for the whole capitalist economy, which is structured so that a lower class exists strictly to take orders, without controlling their work and environment, and are therefore far more physically and mentally distressed. To cope with it, compounded with the effects of extreme class disparities, workers are increasingly taking pharmaceutical and recreational drugs, further threatening their lives and wellbeing. \n\nThis is one of the issues that pushed me into libertarian socialism. Not being able to meaningfully decide how I spend my life, while the only jobs available are ones in which I'd have to submit myself to a corporate hierarchy, then, supposedly, only to escape it by climbing up the hierarchy to submit other people to me, made me feel either like a slave or a master, sometimes both depending on the position, and in any case morally disgusting. I'm either dehumanized and turned into a money-making corporate implement, or I'm doing it to someone else. It obviously made me and others sick. Everyone seems to be taking drugs of one kind or another to get through their lives (I took antidepressants for years, which did nothing and solved no underlying problems of distress). \n\nBut the point should be taken, that economic classes exist concomitantly with classes of mental and physical health, and that the only sure way of increasing the health of most people, by decreasing feelings of distress, is to level the class structure and abolish oppressive hierarchies.\n\nAt any rate, I suggest that everyone read Hari's book. And sorry for the long post.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Johann Hari on Work and Health Inequality"}

So what should we do?  Educating people has been our purpose for a while and it works ever so slowly.

{"author":"Egotisticallama","created_utc":1518616054,"num_comments":7,"score":22,"selftext":"Intro and some of the terminology: (full zine linked below):         \n         \nWe are settlers on this land, raised in cities, rootless, and alienated from the ecosystems we can\u2019t help but be part of. But we want to unlearn what we have been taught by the dominant culture, and in the process, we want to re-learn joy, connection, and wonder, while embracing grief and loss in order to heal. We want to decolonize, and to do this, we need to build a new kind of relationship with the land. We want to take steps towards an anarchist ecology, towards a knowledge of the land that is anti-colonial and anti-authoritarian.\n          \nThis introduction is the beginning of a seven-part series offering some ideas of what an anarchist ecology might be. The other parts will be released throughout April, this exciting springtime month of high water, busy birds, swelling buds, open windows, and wanderlust. We hope these words will compliment the re-birth and inspiration that this season brings you.\n          \nTowards an Anarchist Ecology \u2013 it\u2019s a provocative phrase, but what does it mean? Let\u2019s start by looking at each of these terms separately before we consider their meaning together.\n          \nEcology is the study of interconnectedness in natural communities. It\u2019s the way different plants, creatures, and forces interact with each other to create the conditions for the whole ecosystem. It is also the way they collaborate to bring about succession, the process by which one ecosystem gives way towards another. Succession is also a process of resiliency, towards more diversity and greater health. Theoretically, succession eventually reaches a climax community, which is a rich, stable ecosystem that self-perpetuates. However, climax ecosystems are in reality interconnected with systems of healthy disturbances like fire and wind, as well as impacted by human destruction. And so succession is constantly ongoing and all the various stages of succession are present in wild communities.\n          \nIn our region, the northern-most edge of the Carolinian zone, between Lake Ontario and the Niagara Escarpment, the climax community is often characterized by the association of Sugar Maple and Beech \u2013 can you picture that tall, spacious canopy filtering green sunlight down to the soft leaf-littered ground and an understory of Ironwood, Blue Beech, Choke Cherry, and Pagoda Dogwood? Other climax communities around here are the Oak Savannah, now one of the world\u2019s most endangered ecosystems, and the Oak-Hickory forest. Both of these are abundant food forests that sustained the Chonnonton (Neutral), Onandawaga (Seneca), and Misi-zaagiing (Mississauga) peoples whose traditional territory this land is.\n          \nWe use the word anarchist in the sense of anti-authoritarian, emphasizing the need to challenge the authoritarian tendencies of mainstream ecology, or, as we call it, dominator ecology. Although this is our first time using the word anarchist as the KLR collective, we do identify strongly with anarchy and like organizing within anarchist (and anarchistic) spaces. The clear rejection of the state\u2019s authority by anarchists is a vital step in the process of decolonization. As Mel Bazil, of the Gixsan and Wet\u2019su\u2019weten nations said in a talk at the Victoria Anarchist Bookfair, \u201cAnarchists have stepped away from colonial constructs by asserting that no one is more qualified to live your own life than you.\u201d\n          \nAnd the word \u2018towards\u2019 \u2013 this is perhaps the most important part of our title. We are not offering clear answers here, and we aren\u2019t speaking authoritatively. We are hoping simply to offer some hints and starting points for building an anti-authoritarian, anti-colonial process of knowing the land. There are lots of folks around who have more experience in this than we do, especially in Indigenous communities. The ideas we will outline here are based on the efforts of our collective, in the three years of its existence, to build and share such a knowledge. We draw from our experience of having offered more than thirty workshops in communities throughout the region and from the different perspectives and ways of knowing we encountered in our travels.\n          \n\u2018Towards\u2019 also reminds us that both decolonization and connecting with the land are ongoing processes. Just as there will never be a point when we can stop unlearning and struggling against colonial constructs, there will never be a time when the living earth will stop filling us with wonder, turning all that we know into a thousand more questions. We want to let go off this idea of arriving at some point at which we no longer need to strive.\n                   \nIt\u2019s one thing to offer a critique, but it\u2019s a bigger challenge to offer an alternative. The rest of the zine seeks to lay out five starting points for an anti-colonial, anti-authoritarian way of connecting with the land. These starting points are: rooted in relationships, deep listening, urban ecology, re-enchanting, and unexpertness. We have tried to identify and avoid the usual pitfalls of cultural appropriation, de-politicization, escape, expertly arrogance, and hastily jumping to an energetic or spiritual way of connecting.\n\nAt the root of it, we believe that everyone, wherever they are, inhabits a watershed and is a dynamic living creature that is part of a complex and beautiful web of interrelationships. We can choose to ground ourselves in this truth, to connect with the land around us, and let the health of our communities guide our actions.\n\nThis zine represents some of the conclusions we\u2019ve reached in our four years of exploration as Knowing the Land is Resistance. We hope you will find something in it to help you in breaking with this stifling society of control and in finding lives of freedom and wildness.    \n                   \n**Dominator Ecology:** Mainstream ecology is deeply colonial and frequently acts at the service of political institutions and corporations. We want to dismiss the practice of dominator ecology, how and why it does what it does, without dismissing many of its insights and findings. We also want to speak honestly about the role dominator ecology plays in the destruction of the wild and ongoing colonization.         \n       \n&lt;&lt;Our critique of the mainstream science of ecology, or as we termed it, dominator ecology, centres around the idea that \u201c[It] is the ecology of management from a distance, and of remote expertise, that sees itself as fundamentally separate from the land, inhabiting a present without a past or future.\u201d We trace out how the practice of dominator ecology upholds colonial and capitalist structures while enforcing our alienation from the land by situating it as the realm of experts.&gt;&gt;\n         \n**Rooted in Relationships:** When we talk about knowing the land, we are talking about building a relationship with the land. This involves radical interconnectivity, engagement, reading the land\u2019s history, and cultivating joy and humility.         \n         \n**Deep Listening:** Like in any good relationship, we will get to know the land using deep listening, which means reconnecting with our senses, being open to tragic realities, and resisting the easy answers of appropriating spiritual practices.         \n         \n**Urban Ecology:** The wild is everywhere, and land in cities is just as important to the health of our watersheds as are conservation areas. We will also explore how the health of human communities and the health of the land are linked by the power dynamics that harm each of them, such as gentrification, industrialism, and industrial collapse.         \n         \n**Re-enchanting:** How can we make our passions contagious? How can we spread a decolonizing practice of knowing the land? What issues of access to wild spaces exist, and how can we break those barriers?         \n         \n**Un-expert-ness:** The idea of expertise is one of the big ways we\u2019re kept from connecting with the land and kept alienated from our own experience, as if we\u2019re not qualified to notice what is around us. As well, the pressure of \u2018being an expert\u2019 can stifle our own growth by making it hard to ask questions and be vulnerable. How can we cultivate non-hierarchical knowledge?         \n         \nhttps://www.indybay.org/uploads/2014/01/28/towards-anarchist-ecology.pdf\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Towards an Anarchist Ecology (Zine) - Knowing the Land is Resistance Collective (rad genderqueer folks based in Dish with One Spoon Territory)"}

The term \u2018globalization\u2019 has been used as a portmanteau containing all of the sly nuance of neoliberalism. Globalization is the rush of capital into every conceivable crevice of the planet in search of profitable new ventures. Unfortunately, markets must be pried open with war when rhetorical picklocks don\u2019t suffice. The term \u2018humanitarian\u2019 is the masque we now affix to the gruesome face of war whenever we must attack some recalcitrant socialist backwater. What we used to call a \u2018civilising mission\u2019 in Africa, we now call a \u2018humanitarian intervention\u2019 in the Middle East. Historians call that \u2018progress.\u2019\n\nBetter to endlessly maintain the status quo as one wrestles with the philosophic implications of global capitalism. This was Obama\u2019s favorite tactic. Open a dialogue, but don\u2019t change anything important\n\nThanks to the MSM(mainstream media), though, most of us continue to believe the rhetorical platitudes of our corrupt leaders. Media is one of our numberless emasculated institutions, which are now authoritarian and warlike. (See liberal faith in the Mueller investigation, led by a neoliberal imperialist who fought to crush Vietnamese socialism and led the FBI, one of the most regressive and criminal organizations in the world.)\n\nThe problem with democracy is that it isn\u2019t very profitable for capital. Socialist countries tend to emphasize social services. It is extremely hard to make money delivering quality social services to the poor. Really, the only way to make money off of social services is to deliver inadequate social services to the middle class for extravagant fees. See Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act for a master class in this technique. Monopoly capitalism is incompatible with actual democracy. To the degree that a truly democratic society can have free markets, they must be strictly regulated, prevented from reaching monopoly status, and completely walled off from public institutions. Otherwise, they will cannibalize those institutions, reshaping them as rubberstamp organs of elite profit.\n\nTo this end, western propaganda outlets have made psychologist Erich Fromm\u2019s warning sound less like prophecy than predestination, \u201cThe danger of the past was that men became slaves. The danger of the future is that men may become robots.\u201d\n\"\n","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Excerpts from J. Hirthler"}

We would swap shifts on a like for like manner so pay would not be effected (ie, you do my five hours here, I do your five hours there). Eventually this turned into us completely rewriting the monthly rotas in an emergent way so people could effectively choose when to work, as long as it was the delegated amount of hours. Their were a few other rules like making sure there was always a medic and line manager on, but this rarely caused problems.\n\nEventually the daily rotas written by management too were thrown out, and staff would just decide amongst ourselves how tasks were shared out at the beginning of shifts.\n\nThere were multiple attempts to crackdown on this, but our response was by working to rule for about three hours before the guilt of watching everything fall apart convinced us to go back to self management.\n\nSo, does anybody else have a secret chat where they organise to make work fairer? I want to know if this is a common thing.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"Has anybody found themselves organising at work for the sake of work?"}

I think it is true that in every instance a revolution has occurred and has successfully overthrown the powerful, there hasn't been fully realized way to transition to anarchism or a fully realized view of what anarchism would be. \n\nI find trying to bring about anarchism to be quite similar to fighting a disease, only on a societal scale. The first step is to diagnose the problem, which has had extensive work done, although I think a full comprehensive list of all the current problems of our societies should be made to properly diagnose what is happening.  I think it is important not to get caught up on terms like capitalism and states and rather focus on the specific problems that need to be addressed. The next step would be to find the cure to the illness, which anarchism is, but it is still not clear enough to the average person what that world would be. Seeing as anarchism relies on the voluntary involvement of the majority of people, it is essential that the common people know exactly what it is we are trying to achieve.\nThe third step is to then administer the cure, which is when the support of the people becomes vital as the only way it's possible is with everyone, otherwise we'd likely end up with some form of minority control as has happened in the previous revolutions.\n\nThe other problem is the symptoms of this illness, as they need to be addressed and treated too, but I think that must happen after the root cause has been removed, so they will not appear again.\n\nSo what do you think of this and what can you contribute to this plan of attack against our humin societal illness?\n\nI will be working on this extensively going forward and will post my updates here and on other subreddits if people are interested. I'm tired of the status quo and I want to live in an anarchist world by the time I have children.

A. for a little while now, and what I'm seeing here from a political standpoint has been incredibly inspiring to me. \n\nI've never seen as much generalized antiauthoritarian sentiments in any region of the world. I'm not exagerating, *every* local I've hung out with is just kind of like \"fuck the government/business\". \n\nThis general attitude manifests in social movements as well. I went into the Andes from the Atacama desert of Chile, and when our car got to the salt lake the roads were completely barricaded by native Atacamans flying black flags! They were taking it from a fancy hotel franchise to autonomously administer! I also heard about strong anarchist mining labor movements and saw black flags they had placed in certain places.\n\nAfter a long history of racism like any colonized place, basically all of the indigenous people I've talked to have commented on how people are proud of their ethnic background increasingly so when in the past it was a source of shame. Traditional cultures are still very strong and now being celebrated as well as (very beautiful) indigenous languages like Quechua.\n\nOne part of this, is that Bolivia currently has the first indigenous leader in S.A. history. And I have to say, he actually seems to be doing some *real* socialist things (I know fuck all politicians and all). At the very least actually resisting neoliberalism in a meaningful way. \n\nNow here's what's really great, the (mostly indigenous) Bolivians I have been hanging out that have expressed anticapitalist sentiments *don't buy into the personality cult* and are skeptical of him. While still supporting his socialistic policies and the cultural significance of newfound respect of indigenous culture (a good example is the respect of the coca plant), they are vigilant of statist bullshit.\n\nTl;Dr I'm rambling about the antiauthoritarianism that is very prevalent in the places I've traveled. I'm posting it to give hope to people that are discouraged by living in places where the majority of people are more politically complacent. Also to see if there are any South American comrades here that want to give me more information or context to the things I'm seeing.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"South America"}

First one being that it is 4:22 in the morning, so I'm expecting this rant to have some parts that make less sense than they would when I'm fully awake and rested and not overcome by the dreadful grip of insomnia. Second, I understand the things I say will be controversial to which I am ok with, and hope this will turn more into a civil discussion as opposed to my previous experiences in this sub. Third, this are my personal beliefs and you are welcomed to disagree and ask questions about it, this are just thoughts that I have been having while sleep deprived. Fourth remember we're on the same side here, so of we disagree let's put aside hostility and use our brains to discuss instead of turning this post into a \"my anarchist dick is bigger than yours kind of thing.\"\n\nOk now my thoughts... I have always said that I am an anarchist by heart but socialist in mind (i'm translating the best I can), I have devoted my last few years to spreading the thoughts and teachings of organization, rights of the workers, syndicalism, and a world in which the borders are no longer drawn on maps but we will be united by culture and the ability to talk to eachother trade and figure shit out together. I aim for this things though I am aware as a species we are not socially evolved to create this anarchist utopia, which is why I believe the state is something we have to use in our favor to guide the masses into the right path and then let them be free, a transitional state if you may. \n\nGoing back to the idea of an anarchist utopia, I like to think that the way we achieve it is by a cultural revolution created through some sort of (un)natural selection in which those that work together survive and the ones who don't well, they have a harder time. We achieve this by transforming our culture into what it is supposed to be like, communal beings working together.  The reason I explain this is because as an anarchist I disagree with the anti-estate violence that some anarchists follow, bombing and using armed revolts to spread the idea of a stateless society. Why do I think this? Though I would love to eradicate the government and the private sector, I believe unless it is the will of all the people, the violence would just create a vacuum that would just attract the most powerful or charismatic later on. That being said, I do believe there is a place for violence and armed conflict... the one started by the oppressed, workers, and common people to reclaim the quality of life that every human being is entitled, not being treated like filthy animals bred to make a few wealthy, fat and soulless men happy. \n\nAs I mentioned before, I do believe while we get there we need some sort of guiding help that would achieve this cultural shift. We, sadly, need a government that will put a stop to the greedy hunger of power of corporations, and would (as it should) look after it's people. Things like seatbelt regulations, building codes, food standards are some things that current governments have in place and without them, those without money would take advantage of us and could control the masses, which if we think we have it bad living in a capitalist america, that would be the theme of dystopian novels. \n\nBringing it back to gun control. I believe we should have some. I believe we need to have the government say: no you should not buy a gun because you don't pass this criteria, or no you are not allowed to buy a gun because you committed domestic battery, or you clearly have mental issues. We gotta have some sort of oversight that would make it harder for these insane people that are about to go off and murder innocent kids just to prove a point, or even less, none. \n\nYes, I said it... I believe in gun control. Now the implications for anarchists. Let's put aside the whole bullshit excuse of self-defense (I lived for 22 years in Venezuela, in the most dangerous city in the world during peacetime, been mugged, have had a gun pointed at me, a couple of times and cannot tell you of a single instance in which having a gun would have made me feel safer or done anything), and talk about our real motivations as anarchists: armed conflict against the state. \n\nFirst of all I don't think there will be an uprising in the U.S. this country has the working class under a spell, hypnotized by consumerism, reality tv and poisoned by that disgusting lie of the American dream. The average american doesn't care because they don't feel uncomfortable. In Venezuela, people are dying, hungry, poor and there hasn't been a major uprising (yet) after 5 years of repression and ~18 of a pseudosocialist and corrupt state. What makes you think the average american dumbfounded by the superbowl and the Kardashians are going to raise against a capitalist state? Most americans can't even differentiate antifa from the al-right. \n\nBut anyways yeah ok let's say that we pass gun control...If we did what I am suggesting the government should do, it would probably affect us too, left radicals that clearly don't like the government. But here is what I have to say about it: SO WHAT? We are anarchists. We don't need the government giving us permission to acquire guns. Did you think Franco or Mussolini gave permission to the communists and anarchists permission to own guns? No. They organized, found a way of getting the guns and used them to fight fascism. Why do we need the permission from the government? Since when do anarchists care?\n\nNow, what would be the benefits of gun control? Well the biggest one would be that it'd make it harder for people to impulse-buy a gun. I am from chicago, a city with a \"gun problem\" like conservatives like to point out. I know how to get a gun legally, I drive south for half an hour and get myself a gun in Indiana. Now, I have absolutely no idea how to get a gun illegally. It would probably require me to go to some shady areas of town I am not familiar with. Maybe this won't stop all mass shootings and senseless violence but boy it might stop one or two psycho from getting a gun and killing innocent people. I'm willing to pay that price to save an innocent life. \n\nDo we really want to support the leverage the NRA and gun industry have over the current government? I am not completely against guns; as I mentioned, I believe violence is necessary in some instances (spain and Italy earlier in the last century are perfect examples) but hell I don't think any person with a couple of bucks should be able to get a gun. \n\nAnyways that was the end of my thoughts. You guys have a good day and thanks for reading. ","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"This is my rant on gun control"}

You can seperate the need for justified violence (in a non-revolutionary setting)  against explicit fascists from (imo) unjustified violence against 'moderate' conservatives.\n\n1. Nazis espouse and advocate oppression. Oppression and hate is their policy, rather than the result of their policy (like conservatives)\n\n2. Nazis ideas are formed from irrational hatred and psuedo-science. They hurt and destroy lives based on irrational belief in misinformation that cannot be 'debated', because its based of hatred and conspiricy, any counter argument is dismissed i.e communist, jewish, sjw, cultural marxist ect. \n\nWith this considered violence seems a nescessary tool to stop fascism and racism from gaining significant power. \n\nHowever, people are warrented in being concerned about the *use* of violence. Even if justified on ethical or rational terms, can violence against fascism be seen as counter productive in any given scenario? I.e:\n\n1.People sympathising 'victims' holding fascist views, . People can and will feel sympathy for some of the worst people. This combined with the power of the media maybe detrimental to our cause. \n\n2.People viewing radicalism as negative or irrational. Again supported by media, slowing down the process of radicalisation.\n\n\nSo 3 questions.\n\nAre these concerns justified as a radical leftist?\n\nIs it particularly *liberal* to hold these concerns, even though you support revolution and the use violence? \n\nHow should the possible *unjustified* use of violence be interpretted within radical circles?\n\nNOTE:\n\nYes i have poor grammer and spelling, dsylexia. \n\nNo im not a concern troll. Theres no such thing, besides i largley support the use of violence against fascism and the police. \n\nThank you to anyone with a though out reply\n\n\nEdit: as always any good reading on the subject is much appreciated thank you.

Several politicians, most notably Marco Rubio yesterday, are getting politically reamed by an outraged public suddenly willing to collectively (Seemingly unanimously) target them for blame, alongside a news media suddenly willing to champion this public rage by identifying and focusing on recipients of NRA donations instead of sidelining the discussion into secondary concerns. Long time enthusiasts are sawing their ARs in half on Youtube, consumers are boycotting Koch and NRA-affiliated companies, and people in general are finally getting angry about the fact that their children are being murdered. Even though I don't think there will be enough pressure this time around for reforms to be implemented, it does look like we are getting close to the tipping point on gun control action.\n\nI'd like to be thrilled and yet, I am not. I am worried.\n\nI absolutely think that US society needs to have a more healthy and responsible relationship with firearms. But I don't think that bans are the answer: Not when your bloated, uneducated police force is still allowed to have all the weaponry their shriveled little hearts desire. Not when you have the world's largest military with a long history of violently crushing nearly all civilian revolt. As much as saying it is somewhat distasteful, the 2nd amendment nuts are not entirely wrong. But wait, that's not what I'm really worried about. Beyond the immediate knee-jerk concerns about the public's ability to keep powers in check (Which are already in the shitter anyway, guns or not), my real concern is that if reasonable gun control *actually* happens soon, what happens to discussions about white male violence? What happens to discussions about pervasive privilege? What happens to those crucial conversations when the shooters thereon out get described as 'criminals with illegally trafficked black market rifles' instead of 'white male teens with perfectly legal firearms and socially encouraged ideologies'?\n\nPressure is building against the inequality, privilege, and violence that this country runs on as the external consequences of those elements become harder for our advantaged population to ignore. This is nothing new! The comforts afforded to the liberal middle class have always been in logical conflict with the consequences of those comforts, and whenever that conflict edges toward crescendo the *cause* of it is never addressed, as addressing the cause would inevitably threaten to dilute the unjust privilege that the liberal class enjoys - Not to mention the social control of the oligarchs they emulate. Instead, the pressure is addressed by a temporary release valve, usually by finagling with and restricting some previously state-granted right. Essentially I'm worried that this is Black Panthers in California all over again. I'm worried that this collective societal push toward restricting individual freedoms (Sorry if I sound like a kook but that's literally what this is) is less about concerns of violence and more about revulsion and unease toward having discussions of patriarchy, racism and our other hierarchical ills. \n\nI'm worried that right now, both the mainstream right and left are clamoring to chip away further at their individual freedoms only so that they will need not talk about their own continued injustices. And after all is said and done, cops will still be killing an order of magnitude more people every year than every mass shooter combined.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"I'm concerned about the way the US public is addressing gun violence"}

I quickly realize what's happened. There's a tired urgency rushing me through my morning routine. \n\nTwenty minutes later, I'm out the door. I need twenty minutes to get there, but I only have ten. I have to speed if I want to arrive on time.\n\nI hesitate, but it's the only way. My hands shaking, my forehead melting, the anxiety took hold. I never even thought of something as wrong as this. Yet, here I am.\n\nI listen to the radio to calm myself. I hear the news of another supermarket shooting. It's been 3 times this year. They need to fix it like the did the schools and churches. We need to be safe.\n\nI arrive at the high school. I found some comfort in not knowing if I beat the clock. If I was late, I'd rather not know it for just a little more.\n\nAs I turn right following the sidewalk, I see six other students waiting to enter. I think I made it. Overjoyed with the good news, I pick up my sluggish pace. \n\nI take my spot in line as it moves forward one space. The guards are quick today. The next kid steps through the metal detector. It sounds off. The other students step back and I follow suit.\n\nThe guards get the brat against the wall. The tall one gives him a rough pat down. He's sick of punks who can't follow orders. Reaching into the suspect's hoodie, the guard retrieves a cell phone. He attempts to explain, but that won't save him. The guard mocks him with put on stuttering and voice cracking. The other makes sure to poke him with one of those sticks they carry for good measure. Before he can move on they confiscate the device.\n\nEveryone knows not to bring a phone to school. They're not allowed and cannot be brought through the detectors. The line moves on. It can't be much longer.\n\nAt least, that's what I thought. The \"student\" in front of me warrants suspicion from the guards. He's not really from here. I can see it. He's been standing there quietly this whole time just waiting to pull something. This time the stout guard shoves him to the wall. \n\nIt's a long process, but it keeps us safe. We don't worry about what used to happen at schools when they weren't protected.\n\nThe other guard tells me to get to class. I walk down the hall knowing I'm being watched. It was either a camera of armed guard in every hallway. Mom told me kids in her high school years hung out with friends before class started. They fixed that a long time ago. Now, if we idle in the hall, someone will be sent to send us to class or suspend us.\n\nI would normally take a glance at the office on my way to first hour if I had time. The blue tent from the bullet proof glass always stood out to me. I see the same people in there often. A few people have all the problems. \n\nI continue to move down the hall to my English class. That class always gave me the feeling there was something wrong with me. I don't feel comfortable saying what I think out loud. What if I'm wrong?\n\nOutside the English doorway awaits another guard. I must ask him to let me through. That always made me worry. I don't know any of their names and their eyes hide behind sunglasses. It's impossible to know how they feel about you. Giving one a bad first impression is the last thing I want to do.\n\nHe unlocks the door for me and I sit down. I'm the last one here. The assignment has been handed out. We have two weeks to write about our freedom as Americans and why we are thankful for it.","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"We need to be safe."}

I am currently a PhD student in Philosophy. As my username suggests I do study Gilles Deleuze (he's a French post modern continental philosopher who passed away quite recently by philosophy standards 1995). My dissertation project is on comparative philosophy focusing on Deleuze and N\u0101g\u0101rjuna. I just recently found this subreddit earlier today and while my initial impression was happiness at the recognition of racism and oppression that people of Asian descent in America I grew uneasy with the amount of misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, anti-semitism, anti-blackness etc., expressed in much of the posts in the subreddit. \n\nThis is post is not meant to be me lecturing down to people, I fully recognize that I am privileged to be able to afford to study philosophy at the doctorate level without having to truly worry about finances. I recognize that my parents have put me in a socio-economic position that many others don\u2019t have access to. If this post comes across as being elitist then I apologize. All I ask for is an open mind and willingness to engage with what I am saying critically. This post is meant to come from the perspective of someone who is Asian in America coming to the subreddit from an Anarchist, Deluzean, and Buddhist perspective and its framing of my perception of activism and engagement with other minorities in America.\n\nFirstly, I am going to draw from a thread on the first page of the subreddit as examples of what issues I am talking about and how it impacts my perception of the subreddit. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/7zp910/asian_people_its_nothing_but_mutual_loathing/dur1yjc/\nHere in the comment chain we have a lot of internalized trans- and homophobia. The message being sent is explicitly one of \u201cwhy can\u2019t you be happy with x?\u201d \u201ctrans/gay visibility for Asian men is bad because it reinforces Asian men as not being masculine\u201d and \u201cmost people on the subreddit are straight men, why should we promote anything that doesn\u2019t help them?\u201d \n\nThis is problematic because it is doing exactly what western culture writ large does to all minorities. It otherizes and pits them against each other. By creating the false narrative of the \u2018model minority\u2019 Asian people in the US are forced into a box and have a target unfairly painted on them by other minorities. The Hungarians called it szal\u00e1mitaktika. We would call it divide and conquer. Historically we see the attitude being portrayed in the above thread by the \u201cwhite moderates\u201d during the civil rights era in American history. Why aren\u2019t you happy with this, isn\u2019t it enough? Why do you want more?  It\u2019s also represented in the history of feminist activism in the US as well. Where white women would tell women of color, queer women, and gay women that it wasn\u2019t their time yet and that we need to fight for them first. It\u2019s inherently problematic because at that point the movement really isn\u2019t about women, or in this case about Asian people in America. It\u2019s about a specific subset of Asian people and the rest need to \u2018fight for the group and wait your turn\u2019 because it will benefit them as well.\n\nThe titular post of the referenced thread also embodies a sense of \u2018Asians are better\u2019, or \u2018Asians first\u2019 mentality which is problematic as well. (Note this is my interpretation of the OP, if I am wrong please let me know and I\u2019ll edit this section) It paints a picture of many West Asian and European cultures as being hateful, spitful barbaric cultures. However, it also neglects that fact that this same hatred is present in \u2018Asians\u2019 as well. Within the last 100 years the Japanese people committed scores of atrocities in South East Asia against countless other \u2018Asian\u2019 peoples. Going farther back we can see that for most of its history the Korean peninsula was a conquest kingdom, under the dominion of China or Japan as a tribute state. Taiwan was occupied for five decades by Japan between 1895 and 1945. The history of China itself is dotted with centuries of warfare where Chinese people killed each other. To speak of \u2018Asians\u2019 as a unified group is a misnomer and to paint a historically inaccurate and dangerous picture. It creates an artificial \u2018in\u2019 group and otherizes and distances that in group from everyone else (in this case members of West Asian and European culture). This is the same type of otherization that Trump used during his campaign and into his current tenure as president. \u201cMexico is not sending their best\u2026 they're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.\u201d Etc. If the goal of Asian activism in the West is to fight against racism and to stop discrimination against Asian people then you aren\u2019t going to win by replicating the same methods kyriarchy has used to oppress minorities for centuries. To quote Audre Lorde \u201cThe master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house.\u201d\n\nI won\u2019t use a specific thread for this point but there seems to be a disturbing amount of focus on \u2018racial purity\u2019 within the subreddit specifically surrounding Asian women not dating Asian men and vice versa. The implicit thought process behind that type of thinking is that Asian women are race traitors if they don\u2019t marry/date within the \u2018asian\u2019 population. This mindset denies Asian women their autonomy and dignity as human beings. It creates a culture where Asian men believe that they are entitled to Asian women or that Asian women who do not date them are in the wrong. It perpetuates a culture of misogyny and toxic masculinity. In essence the mindset being perpetuated is similar to the one being put forth by white supremacists and the Alt-Right where white women should only date white men to preserve the purity of the \u2018aryan race\u2019.\nTo prevent the post from becoming too long (which it probably already is), I will stop with the examples here and discuss my perspective. To me a lot of the analysis in the subreddit seems to focus solely on the oppression and racism that cis-asian men experience. The issue that I see is that in many cases it focuses on oppression of cis-asian men to the exclusion of every other issue. \n\nFrom an anarchist and Deleuzean perspective this is problematic because oppression is not a singular. You cannot address racism against Asian people with recognizing that that oppression is intertwined with the oppression of black people, latinX people, gay people, trans people, queer people, poor people, the differently abled, women etc. Oppression is a matrix, its interconnected. By saying that we should focus on cis-asian men first is saying that the oppression that all of those other people I just listed experience is fundamentally different and alien to the oppression that cis-asian men experience. It replicates the hierarchy that cis-asian men find themselves stratified and segmentized in within Western society and creates it within the activist response. Now cis-asian men are on the top of the \u201coppression that is important to focus on first\u201d hierarchy. Perhaps I am wrong, but it seems reflected to me in the posts in the subreddit of \u201cI\u2019ll never fight for black equality before asian people.\u201d Etc. \n\nFrom a Buddhist and Deleuzean perspective the essentialization of \u2018Asian\u2019 as a static, concretized identity marker creates an anchor that one wishes to hold onto. When one perceives that it is being attacked one will go to any lengths to preserve the illusion of its existence. If you were to walk out the next day and get hit by a car and had to have both your legs amputated, would you still say that you are the same person? Within an information based society we could argue that your name is still \u2018you\u2019, you still have the same bank account, birthday, job etc but we have an inclination that some has changed and that you are no longer the you from before the car collision. Identity is an illusion and while it has a power all its own in fighting against the oppressive matrix of domination to hold onto it is to misunderstand reality. There is no self, merely anatta to hold onto the self is to cling to desire and suffering.","subreddit":"aznidentity","title":"A Philosophical Perspective of the Subreddit""num_comments":6,"score":9,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Anarchism","title":"A Philosophical Perspective of the Subreddit"}

Because its scale is so unfathomably large &amp; terrifying, people do the expected: essentially ignore it. They may eat a plant-based diet, or not use straws, or bike as much as possible, or organize &amp; participate in environmentally conscious communities, but the fact is we cannot stop our impending doom.

This is essentially a tangent, based in the denial of despair.

But I am also not trying to debate anarchism but just understand how people think it is plausible. Assuming anarchist are in favor of the elimination of the state, how do people in such a society respond effectively to individuals or groups wishing to use violence to exploit people? How do you resolve interpersonal disputes where it is unclear which party is wrong without an institution like the state with rules for resolving disputes and a monopoly on the right to use force? \n\nTake the following example: Lets says farmer Joe and farmer Eli have farmland that borders each other. There is one parcel of land that both claim to be their own. \n\nLet's assume both are unwilling to compromise, as each is absolutely convinced that the parcel is their legitimate property. Joe, informs Eli that he will be planting his crops on the disputed parcel and use force if necessary to keep Eli off of the disputed parcel. Eli is outraged, as he feels his property has basically been annexed and that his only recourse to use violence in response to Joe's threat. Eli, however, is not as confident as Joe and wants to avoid a violent altercation. Eli is convinced he is in the right so he suggests to Joe that they both agree on a third party to judge who has a valid claim to the disputed parcel. Joe, however, refuses - he is absolutely convinced the land is rightfully his and sees no reason why he should open himself up to the risk of somebody else deciding property that is rightfully his own belongs to Eli. \n\nAt this point, Eli can either use violence to enforce his claim to the parcel, use violence to force Joe to agree to a mediator, or acquiesce. If Eli is actually in the right, it would seem that violence would be justified, since Joe is stealing Eli's property and unwilling to pursue non-violent avenues for resolving the dispute. Imagine Eli hires a militia to force Joe to attend mediation. What is the principal difference between Joe's militia and a state? Both are using violence against Joe when Joe never consented to be under their power and forcing Joe to recognize the judgment of a third party.

But I am also not trying to debate anarchism but just understand how people think it is plausible. Assuming anarchist are in favor of the elimination of the state, how do people in such a society respond effectively to individuals or groups wishing to use violence to exploit people? How do you resolve interpersonal disputes where it is unclear which party is wrong without an institution like the state with rules for resolving disputes and a monopoly on the right to use force? \n\nTake the following example: Lets says farmer Joe and farmer Eli have farmland that borders each other. There is one parcel of land that both claim to be their own. \n\nLet's assume both are unwilling to compromise, as each is absolutely convinced that the parcel is their legitimate property. Joe, informs Eli that he will be planting his crops on the disputed parcel and use force if necessary to keep Eli off of the disputed parcel. Eli is outraged, as he feels his property has basically been annexed and that his only recourse to use violence in response to Joe's threat. Eli, however, is not as confident as Joe and wants to avoid a violent altercation. Eli is convinced he is in the right so he suggests to Joe that they both agree on a third party to judge who has a valid claim to the disputed parcel. Joe, however, refuses - he is absolutely convinced the land is rightfully his and sees no reason why he should open himself up to the risk of somebody else deciding property that is rightfully his own belongs to Eli. \n\nAt this point, Eli can either use violence to enforce his claim to the parcel, use violence to force Joe to agree to a mediator, or acquiesce. If Eli is actually in the right, it would seem that violence would be justified, since Joe is stealing Eli's property and unwilling to pursue non-violent avenues for resolving the dispute. Imagine Eli hires a militia to force Joe to attend mediation. What is the principal difference between Joe's militia and a state? Both are using violence against Joe when Joe never consented to be under their power and forcing Joe to recognize the judgment of a third party.
