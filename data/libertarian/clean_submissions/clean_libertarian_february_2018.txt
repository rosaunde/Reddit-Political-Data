(The most extreme example occurred when I called up my provider to dispute what seemed like an unreasonable charge not covered by insurance, and they backed down and *asked me* how much I was willing to pay. What the fuck is this, a Moroccan bazaar?)\n\nAnyway, it seems to me like the FDA has a big part to play in this. It makes it harder for competitors to enter the market, thus boosting prices (as discussed in [this great Slatestarcodex entry](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/08/29/reverse-voxsplaining-drugs-vs-chairs/)). With [the exception of very occasional terminally ill patients](https://www.denverpost.com/2017/08/03/right-to-try-terminally-ill-patients-experimental-drugs-fda/), it forces individuals to accept a single uniformly low threshold of risk, rather than allowing us to make our own choices. And finally, relatedly, by preventing risk-happy people from volunteering for experimental new drug treatments, it deprives us from gathering a lot of data that might inform more risk-averse patients down the line.\n\nSo what's a good libertarian solution? Well, for what it's worth, I don't work in the healthcare field, I have only limited experience of dealing with healthcare in the US, and I'm probably [a pretty soft libertarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill) by the standards of this sub. But here's a simple (modest?) proposal. Why not make the FDA effectively a *rating agency*, whose responsibility is to inform consumers as to the safety of different drug treatments? Crude example: drugs or surgeries could be given a 'traffic light' marker, where red = no trials on humans, yellow = some positive trials but little data on long term side effects, and green = provable efficacy and minimal side effects. Obviously, you'd need a system that's more nuanced than this, to take into account different variables like (i) amount of data supporting positive effects, (ii) amount of data supporting negative side effects, (iii) degree of efficacy of apparent positive effects, (iv) severity of negative side effects, etc.. But allowing drug and treatment consumers to make an informed choice seems like the best option. FWIW, I see a real positive role here for government, in assembling committees of smart, unbiased experts to come up with a reasonable, comprehensible rating system that would let non-experts make reasonably informed choices.\n\nLike I said, I'm no expert on this, but I'm interested to hear everyone's thoughts, as well as other ideas for how all y'all would reform the FDA.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How would you reform the FDA?

(The same agent also reps Judge Napolitano, and mentioned that). This group then went to the folks handling the convention for the LP, demanded Paul be put on the agenda, and claimed they'd later raise the money to pay him. LP didn't bite, for obvious reasons. Even if they could have done it (dubious), the party's not particularly interested in seeing Libertarian donors diverted to pay for an exorbitant speaking fee with no real benefit. If the Mises [sic] Caucus would like to raise and spend that much money and rent a room in New Orleans and have Paul speak... well, good luck with that. There's nothing stopping them, though I know a lot of Libertarian candidates who could better spend that money in the 2018 elections. There are races that could be won on less money than that.\n\nAnd if he desires it enough to say he's coming regardless, I have little doubt Paul would be given a slot on the main-stage. It was just at the last convention that we gave him an award that he accepted via video message, after all. (An award given with some fair internal grumbling over his lack of support for the party or any of its candidates, while still often endorsing and supporting Republicans).\n\nShort version: much ado about nothing. Ron Paul himself expressed no interest in wanting to speak in New Orleans, and he still hasn't.\n\nThe whole point of this exercise was never to actually have him speak, but rather to frame a purely manufactured controversy, and that intention is absurdly transparent. I've had plenty of gripes about the party's management and operations and convention-planning, but this whole thing is nonsense.

{"author":"Greypages87","created_utc":1517687615,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"Some of my thoughts, in no particular order, that I originally posted to my blog, and I've decided to post here. I am well aware that I hold some unpopular and/or controversial views. Some of you might find these contentions to be blasphemous, but please do be kind. We're all entitled to our opinions. I'm simply trying to start a dialogue that I think is important. So let me begin....\n\nWE ARE LIVING IN A MEDICOLEGAL DYSTOPIA\n\nWe have become completely dependent upon the therapeutic establishment for the most basic of our health and lifestyle needs. We\u2019ve relinquished our autonomy as individuals with respect to our well being.\n\nClinical euphemisms are applied to our everyday struggles. They are categorized and indexed as \u201cserious medical conditions\u201d for which you must consult a doctor for official diagnosis and \u201ctreatment\u201d - often a regimen consisting of state sanctioned medications.\n\nModern mental and behavioral health takes this phenomenon of pathologizing humanity to an unprecedented level of absurdity, condemning individuals in their attempts to act as autonomous agents - often with the use of non-sanctioned palliatives. Attempts at free agency in one\u2019s own well being are often said to be symptomatic of another \u201cillness\u201d. These people are \u201caddicts\u201d, and need \u201ctreatment\u201d.\n\nMental and behavioral health is in some ways on par with religion. Medical subspecialties have been created out of imposing a set of social constructs built upon the puritanical moral sensibility. Addiction treatment is nothing more than morally imperialistic pseudomedical religious indoctrination. I like how Stanton Peele puts it - \u201c...an old and familiar moralism, albeit dressed in contemporary medical garb.\"\n\nOtherwise law abiding citizens whose only offense has been the use, possession, or sale of controlled substances are arrested, prosecuted, and are subjected to compulsory treatments consisting of pseudomedical religious dogma.\n\nThe prohibitionist medicolegal machine is a self perpetuating entity. While it exacerbates our vulnerability to the ills of drugs and their use, our vulnerability makes its existence necessary to our livelihood.\n\nThe medicolegal complex creates desperate and powerless individuals and creates industries to \u201ctreat\u201d them - medication assisted treatments such as methadone and buprenorphine arbitrarily apply medical euphemisms to legalized access. These effective \u201cevidence based\u201d practices are then mischaracterized as marvels of modern medicine.\n\n\u201cDRUG LITERACY\u201d IS ABSENT. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY IS NONEXISTENT\n\nMeanwhile, drug literacy - not to mention personal responsibility - is nonexistent. Our stubborn refusal to accept drug realities, and our childlike deference to the therapeutic establishment have rendered us helpless and incompetent. Psychiatrist/Scholar Thomas Szasz in \"Our Right to Drugs\" tries to explain that \"....after generations of living under medical tutelage that provides us with protection (albeit illusory) against dangerous drugs, we have failed to cultivate the self-reliance and self-discipline we must possess as competent adults surrounded by the fruits of our pharmacological-technological age.\"\n\nDiscussing drugs with a layperson can feel like discussing quantum physics with a five year old.\n\nDiscussing \u201cdrug addiction\u201d with a layperson is like with discussing our planetary orbital rotation with a flat-earther.\n\nOur conceptualizations of drugs and addiction are pervaded by myths, misconceptions, and superstitions that originate within treatment and law enforcement and are propagated by mindless, sensational media stories. We tend to accept this folk wisdom blindly and uncritically. These assumptions include (but are by no means limited to):\n\nThat drugs cause addiction\n\nThat drug use spreads like a viral outbreak, and that drugs and addiction impose themselves upon innocent addiction \u201csufferers\u201d and keep them under their spell, compelling them to do things they don\u2019t want to do.\n\nThat drugs are deterministic agents with wills of their own for the individual and people are mere passive vessels for their effects - certain drugs cause certain behaviors. \u201cBath salts\u201d for instance are believed to turn users into flesh eating zombies. They shed their clothing and begin eating flesh because, well, that\u2019s just what the chemical makes them do. In addition to a pharmacological course of action, we grant drugs a behavioral course of action. For instance we seem to assume that alcohol not only inhibits our behavioral filters (a process called disinhibition), but that it actually causes behaviors like violent assault and sexual promiscuity. It seems to be folk wisdom among drug-using criminal offenders that benzodiazepines like alprazolam turn them into kleptomaniacal automatons, regardless of whether or not they\u2019re behaviorally predisposed to stealing. In LA in the 90\u2019s PCP was said to make users violent and produce superhuman strength.\n\nThat addiction is a disease and without medical treatment it will inevitably progress to \u201cjails, institutions, and death\u201d.\n\nThat once you\u2019re an \u201caddict\u201d you\u2019ll always be an \u201caddict\u201d\n\nThat abstinence is the only way to recover, and that moderation is not feasible - be it with the use of certain drugs or for people with \u201cthe disease of addiction\u201d.\n\nThat drugs are illegal because they are harmful.\n\nThat drugs rob people of free will.\n\nThat if a substance makes them \u201cfeel good\u201d then it shouldn\u2019t be legal - \u201cThis is amazing! How is it legal?\u201d.\n\nThat there be a dichotomy between medical use and abuse - rather than substance use occurring across a spectrum, which I propose that it does.\n\nThat drug availability = drug addiction.\n\nThat the relationship of drug use to socially deviant behavior is causative rather than correlative.\n\nTHE MORAL AND MEDICAL MODELS ARE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME PURITANICAL COIN\n\nWe assume, wrongly, that we must choose between treating substance use as a moral problem or a medical problem. The moral approach and the medical approach are two sides of the same oppressive, puritanical coin. The moral model proposed that drugs and the people who use them were the problem, while the medical model attributes the problem to an innate bio-spiritual quirk referred to as the \u201cdisease of addiction\u201d. The moralized approach has been to jail the dopefiend, and/or help them find christ, while the medicalized approach is to \u201ctreat\u201d the \u201caddict\u201d.... AND to help them find the functional equivalent of a guiding religious deity.\n\nTREATMENT IS INEFFECTIVE, POINTLESS, COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, AND DANGEROUS.\n\nTreatment doesn\u2019t work because you can\u2019t treat a disease that\u2019s not really there.\n\nThe addiction treatment industry wants us to believe that problematic substance use is a disease that must be treated medically. They tell us that addiction is an entity unto itself - some bio-spiritual quirk that those so afflicted are born with that causes them to use substances compulsively, against their own will. Addiction treatment isn\u2019t helping. In fact, it\u2019s failed to yield remission rates any greater than the rates for natural remission. Treatment doesn\u2019t help anyone break the cycle of problematic substance use - It creates an addict identity, and it perpetuates the cycle of self destruction as the powerlessness and loss of control that it teaches becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nWHAT\u2019S MORE: ADDICTION IS NOT A DISEASE.\n\nThey offer us brain scans as \u201cevidence\u201d (before meth and after meth), but the brain scans become meaningless if you're to compare them with the brain scans of anyone else who has learned anything. Drug use changes the brain because that\u2019s what the brain is supposed to do in response to any activity you engage in chronically and repetitively. Neuroplasticity is an important biological process. It's actually happening all throughout your brain at this very moment. It refers to the brain\u2019s ability to change over time - in response to an individual's thinking and their personal habits. Addiction is a learned behavior. It can be - and usually is - unlearned in the course of one\u2019s lifelong development. It\u2019s no coincidence that the people who aren\u2019t \u201cunlearning\u201d it are the same people who are chronically in and out of \u201ctreatment\u201d, attending 12 step meetings, wallowing in their \u201cpowerlessness\u201d and embracing the addict identity. My purpose here isn't to deconstruct the disease model - greater minds than my own have been driving the point home for a long time (See Stanton Peele, Steven Slate, Gene Heyman, Jeffery Shaler, and Marc Lewis), but emphasis on the brain disease model is extremely important because - aside from carrying major public policy implications - it has grave implications for the discussion as a whole. It plays a foundational role in our faulty conceptual framework of drugs and their use.\n\nPROHIBITION DOESN\u2019T WORK.\n\nThe visible toll of drug use and addiction becomes catastrophic as substance users are forced to operate within a prohibitionist framework. Infectious disease, poor quality control, ultra-potent adulterants, dangerous fluctuations in purity, price inflation and associated crime - these issues are created or made worse by repressive drug policies.\n\nIn criminalizing drugs not only are we helping to empower criminals by creating massive profit incentives, but we\u2019re also entrusting quality control of highly potent, highly toxic chemical compounds to degenerates, many of whom cannot read, let alone take proper precautions in processing for distribution a roster of psychoactives that\u2019s come to include USP-grade ultra potent synthetics like carfentanil and more.\n\nThe balloon effect helped create a market for dangerous synthetic drugs. It\u2019s made the opioid crisis more deadly. Exhibit A: Chinese manufactured fentanyl analogues. Exhibit B: The chronic pain industry. While exhibit A is unquestionably a classic example of a balloon effect, exhibit be can be - in its own way - explained by something akin to a balloon effect - failure to socially recognize \u201cnonmedical\u201d uses of certain substances as legitimate will lead - inevitably - to the appearance of new constructs (like chronic pain and medical marijuana industries) to legitimize it. All we are doing is helping to create smoke and mirrors - leading to more death and addiction. Why can we not just circumvent the bullshit and be honest with ourselves about drug use? Smoke and mirrors would no longer be necessary.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Tangential Rant on the sorry state of US Drug Policy"}

{"author":"benjaminikuta","created_utc":1517719235,"num_comments":2,"score":1,"selftext":"Most of us think of homesteading unused resources in the old-fashioned sense of clearing a piece of unowned land and farming the soil. There are, however, more sophisticated and modern forms of homesteading, which should establish a property right. Suppose, for example, that an airport is established with a great deal of empty land around it. The airport exudes a noise level of, say, X decibels, with the sound waves traveling over the empty land. A housing development then buys land near the airport. Some time later, the homeowners sue the airport for excessive noise interfering with the use and quiet enjoyment of the houses.\n\nExcessive noise can be considered a form of aggression but in this case the airport has already homesteaded X decibels worth of noise. By its prior claim, the airport now \"owns the right\" to emit X decibels of noise in the surrounding area. In legal terms, we can then say that the airport, through homesteading, has earned an easement right to creating X decibels of noise. This homesteaded easement is an example of the ancient legal concept of \"prescription,\" in which a certain activity earns a prescriptive property right to the person engaging in the action.\n\nOn the other hand, if the airport starts to increase noise levels, then the homeowners could sue or enjoin the airport from its noise aggression for the extra decibels, which had not been homesteaded. Of course if a new airport is built and begins to send out noise of X decibels onto the existing surrounding homes, the airport becomes fully liable for the noise invasion.\n\nIt should be clear that the same theory should apply to air pollution. If A is causing pollution of B's air, and this can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, then this is aggression and it should be enjoined and damages paid in accordance with strict liability, unless A had been there first and had already been polluting the air before B's property was developed. For example, if a factory owned by A polluted originally unused property, up to a certain amount of pollutant X, then A can be said to have homesteaded a pollution easement of a certain degree and type.\n\nGiven a prescriptive easement, the courts have generally done well in deciding its limits. In Kerlin v. Southern Telephone and Telegraph Co. (1941), a public utility had maintained an easement by prescription of telephone poles and wires over someone else's land (called the \"servient estate\" in law). The utility wished to string up two additional wires, and the servient estate challenged its right to do so. The court decided correctly that the utility had the right because there was no proposed change in the \"outer limits of space utilized by the owner of the easement.\" On the other hand, an early English case decided that an easement for moving carts could not later be used for the purpose of driving cattle.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Homesteading noise."}

Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin as a digital currency alternative to fiat that was envisioned to serve as a means of peer to peer exchange, independent of central government regulation and manipulation. Nakamoto, presumably a programmer and not an economist, has designed Bitcoin with a capped limit of coins: 21 million in total. These are released at a constantly decreasing rate. This has created a revolutionary deflationary economic model. Although technically an inflationary currency until the final bitcoin has been mined in the year 2140, the slow release of Bitcoin against rapidly growing demand, simulates the deflationary system even now. The purposefully designed slow release of Bitcoin with an ultimate capped limit, provides the currency with the desirable nature of being an effective store of value. The value will appreciate as demand increases with limited supply, making the currency a valuable asset. The asset nature of the currency was presumably incorporated to make it appealing over other fiat currencies, the worth of which diminishes with inflation. This has set a president that has been incorporated into the design of most crypto-currencies that have developed in the wake of Bitcoin\u2019s success, and limitations. The ironic problem with such a currency is that it is hoarded instead of utilized. Now recognized in economics as Copernicus\u2019 law, Nicolaus Copernicus described this very phenomena, concluding; that when there are multiple forms of currency in circulation, the weakest will be preferentially used for transaction, and the more valuable will be driven out of circulation as a result of hoarding. This has been demonstrated with crypto-currencies that are preferentially stored instead of spent, because the value invariably increases over time, and thus spending Bitcoin (or other crypto-currency with capped limit) is to sacrifice potential growth. Consequently, despite the many beneficial features of crypto-currency, there are very few real world cases of purchases and/or payment transactions with crypto-currencies. The volatility inherent with most openly traded crypto-currencies compounds this problem. The majority of the population still mentally evaluates price and value on a fiat basis, partly because it is so deeply engrained in our perception of the world, and partly because the price of most crypto-currencies fluctuates so rapidly relative to fiat currencies that it is impractical to spend crypto-currency. As such there is very little sense to purchase using crypto-currency, and very little incentive to do anything other than hold (HODL) in hope/anticipation of the asset price increasing. Regardless of whether the current price of a given coin is $ 0.01 or $ 10 000, the possibility that it will be worth $ 0.02 or $ 20 000 tomorrow, disincentives spending. For crypto-currency to gain real world functionality it needs to be incentivized. Retailers and merchants would need to recognize the future benefit of receiving crypto in payment for goods or services, and therefore offer significant discounts to customers who pay with crypto-currency rather than a flat exchange rate with fiat price.","subreddit":"cotinetwork","title":"A Currency that Serves as an Effective Store of Value""num_comments":3,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"A Currency that Serves as an Effective Store of Value"}

{"author":"TheNewsAnalyst","created_utc":1517893935,"num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"Nunes Memo\nMy first impressions? Yawn fest. Seriously this is the big revelation? That Mr. Steele is biased? That was plainly obvious during the senate investigation during Mr. Simpson's questioning. Also the fact he deliberately leaked his dossier to the press before it was substantiated should have clued us in. There is no question that he and Fusion exercised an anti-Trump bias. However there are strong indications that some of the FBI agents have a strong dislike for Trump. I would have been shocked if turned out that everyone at the FBI loved Trump quite frankly.  This does not mean that they fabricated evidence or committed improprieties. I understand there is some contention about using a FISA warrant in a way that includes an American citizen, but isn't the FBI obliged to do their due diligence against such a serious charge as collusion? The FBI had a campaign manager that is a known foreign agent, as well as highly suspicious circumstances involving Mr. Papadopoulos came to light.  It is reasonable for the FBI to wonder if the campaign is connecting with the Russian foreign nationals.  And isn't it up to the FISC to deside if a FISA warrant is appropriate?  Why weren't they called out on this then?\nNotes on memo\nIsn't it the FISC job to determine if a warrant is necessary? There must be something in the warrant that obliged them to grant the surveillance or they themselves were acting improperly.  Are the Republicans subtly claiming misrepresentation in the warrant?\nDon't we need to see the warrant itself to know what the probable cause was?  Otherwise we cannot properly decide if it was proper.\nIt is well-known Steele's origins and the non-verifiability of the dossier.\nThe role of the DNC was not disclosed however it did mention it was a political organization. That is enough information to know that it is a domestic and politically sensitive matter.  Honestly I question the relevance of this.  Doesn't the FBI have an obligation to follow up on any sufficiently serious allegations?\nI cannot say if the warrant against Mr Gates is proper because I am not a legal expert familiar with the FISA rules, nor do I know what the text of the warrant says. But at this point I cannot assume that the warrant was improper based on just the information in the memo. If Mr. Gates meeting with a foreign agent was independently verified, which is kind of implied, then this could in fact be proper.\nDisclosing to the media is a serious offense for an independent analyst. It has created a serious situation where the general public is being prejudiced due to heavy media involvement. This however says nothing about the FBI's objectivity, or the quality of the information itself. I deem it a non-credible document for other reasons, mostly due to it being poorly written, as well as  lacking confidence statements, source analysis, citations, original transcripts and documents.\nWe already know Steele is biased, it is plainly obvious.  If he was not he would have never leaked his dossier to the press.\nIf the FBI fired Steele, isn't that an indication they aren't biased in his favor?\nIf any part of the Steele dossier is verifiable then I think it is worth at least considering. A non-biased FBI would be doing the due diligence by following up on it.\nIt seems like Nunes was trying to gain points by smearing Mr. Strzok.\nAt the end of the day what matters was were the warrants properly representative of the evidence, and did the FISC do their job correctly.  Neither question is addressed by the memo.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Independent Commentary on Nunes Memo."}

{"author":"Cycloptichorn","created_utc":1518028628,"num_comments":75,"score":10,"selftext":"As many of you have probably heard, the Senate has agreed to a 2-year Budget that adds a lot of new spending.  Here's one of many articles about it:\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/07/shutdown-news-senate-seeks-deal-to-raise-military-spending.html\n\nAccording to the article, the new bill adds about 300 BILLION new dollars in spending.  This is in addition to the nearly trillion-dollar deficits that are already being projected thanks to the tax cut passed in December and a failure to rein in spending elsewhere.  This is not a Dem-controlled Congress adding new spending, it's a GOP-controlled one.  While simultaneously cutting taxes!  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here, as this is a totally and completely irresponsible thing to do and all citizens should be against it.\n\nI know that most Libertarians are very anti-tax and want to see the government shrank as much as possible, which is a fine opinion to have.  However!  I see, over and over, people who vote 'Republican' because 'at least they are interested in cutting spending.'  This is a pure and total lie and I'm getting pretty exasperated by how often I see it posted here.  \n\n**The GOP is not interested in cutting spending, and never has been.  Nor do they care about deficits.**  For my entire life, every single GOP-controlled administration has raised spending and increased the deficit and the debt.  The GOP is no more interested in controlling spending than the Dems are.  Less so, I would say, than the Dems are; and to boot, they are FAR more fiscally irresponsible, because the Dems at least are honest about raising taxes to cover the spending they want; the GOP simply doesn't give a shit and is happy to throw ever-increasing amounts of our budget away, on a yearly basis, as debt service payments.\n\nWhen are Libertarians going to wake up to this scam, and stop voting GOP reflexively?  \n\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"When are Libertarians going to wake up about the reality of the GOP and spending?"}

It is touting Cuba's achievements in some kind of obscure propaganda. Why don't we look at it a bit closer.\n\nThe first touts healthcare \"missions\". This is a bit misleading. Cuba pushed a huge percentage of their GDP into health care. Many African nations contract with Cuba because they are the cheapest international healthcare provider in the world. It is literally their largest export. The only \"mission\" is government revenue. [It's far from \"voluntary\" as well](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/world/americas/brazil-cuban-doctors-revolt.html).\n\nThe post lists medical advancements in the works of Hep-B and HIV research. What? [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis_B_vaccine) is a totally different story with US researchers creating the vaccine. Hell, the vaccine used today was made by a Chilean guy who got his highest degrees in the US. I find it really obscure because under the trade embargo Cuba had serious problems getting up-to-date medical devices because the US has always been the key manufacturer of modern products.\n\nIt's a common theme to mention unemployment and education in Cuba. There is no doubt that literacy rates are high. I'll give them that. There is serious doubt as to unemployment and social living standards. [As of 2015, 5% of the country did not have access to clean water.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Cuba) That's a wiki source. [This source looks even more dire.](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2009/mar/03/access-water) Everybody can read well, but they have no water?\n\n[Even still, were they aware that Cuba had the highest literacy rate among developing countries?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Cuba) Par for the course is the achievement here. They did a great job providing higher education to all. They literally stole the colleges from private owners without reimbursement. Could you imagine your local private college being taken? It sure does make it cheap to provide school when the buildings are stolen. The average person has no access to college either. It's literally unattainable.\n\nEven the most obvious of research leads to conclusions completely apart from what this post displays, yet it has over 1,000 upvotes. Insane.

The black community does have its problems, and they are mostly self inflicted to to the self victimization attitude, but not all niggers are like that.\n\nNiggers are actually great for the economy, and deserve to be credited for the success of the KFC franchises and major sports franchises like the NBA and NFL. Many young high school kids who wouldn\u2019t be able to find a job if niggers didn\u2019t exist have a job at KFC thanks to the niggers that make it a successful franchise. There are tens of thousand of jobs in the sports industry whether it be sports radio show hosts, announcers, marketing, or coaching jobs, and you can thank the niggers for the success of this industry. Niggers also provide entertainment, and it is very likely that you favorite football or basketball team would not exist without niggers, as niggers make up over 50% of the people in the NFL and NBA. If you listen to rap music, that wouldn\u2019t exist without niggers. For fucks sake, human civilization came from Africa, and the first humans were niggers!\n\nNiggers are also great lovers, as they have huge dicks. I am a white gay man, and most of my sexual partners are niggers, and my current boyfriend is a nigger.\n\nThis is why white supremacists should fuck off, and is why niggers should be welcome in America.

When Goldwater lost to a massive statist in LBJ, Hess did NOT take it to well...\n\nAfter the election Hess got audited by the IRS, so his response was to send them a copy of the Declaration of Independence  with a letter saying he would never pay taxes again. He totally abandoned his work in politics in favor of welding, and became a pretty outspoken anarchist.\n\nEventually his views came back around and he joined the Libertarian Party in the 80s.\n\nI found Hess to be a sort of perfect example of what happens when a libertarian gets pushed too far by an ever encroaching government.

They just do. Like Monkeys have a certain unpleasant odor.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons, which vary among the breed...

Here are the ones that are caused by the way they act...\n\n1- Many Niggers don't like to bathe. The sheboons (female niggers) in particular have a thing about getting their hair wet, since doing so ruins the expensive weaving of human hair they usually put in their nappy nigger heads. The water loosens the bond, even just steam does, in case you're thinking, \"Why don't they just wear a shower cap?\". So they will go weeks without washing it. Add that to being just plain lazy when it comes to personal Hygiene, you have a stinky combination.\n\n2- Niggers have a type of skin that, not unlike the hands of a chimp, gets leathery... They call it \"Ashy\"... and when it happens they put this stinky lotion on it, It's usually either Cocoa Butter or another plant called Shea Butter\", which stinks even worse than the first one.

Also, again with the She boons, they have to keep that weave of hair moist, and since Niggers love the scents of \"Tropical\" fruits, such as Mango and Coconut, most of the hair products they use contain those odors... Add that to unwashed dead human hair and... Well... There ya go.\n\nI'm sure others will add things like Jenkem (Fermented Feces and Urine inhaled from Balloons that is used to get high), The stench of clothes that have been permeated with Marijuana smoke and Newport Cigarettes... Eating a ton of Greasy foods like Fried Chicken, Chitlins, and Roughage (Collard Greens) that are a gastrointestinal nightmare that also comes out in the skin...\n\nThe list goes on and on...\n\nThe Beginning and End of the Why is...\n\nBecause they're NIGGERS, and NIGGERS STINK","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"To the posters that keep asking the question \u201cwhy do niggers stink\u201d"}

Who do you think are potential candidates in the future, and how much of a chance do you think they have?  Here are my thoughts on the people below, from most likely to win to least:\n\n1. **Justin Amash - Michigan, 2018**\n\n I don't think he'd have much of a republican opposition, and he is a current Congressman with good name recognition.  He would be running against Debbie Stabenow, who is a long-serving incumbent, so I'm not sure what his chances of winning that election would be, but he probably has a good shot.  He might decide to wait 6 more years until maybe Stabenow retires.  She will be 73 then.\n\n2. **Austin Petersen - Missouri, 2018**\n\n I think his main hurdle is going to be defeating the republican opponent and etablishment favorite Josh Hawley.  Hawley seems like a very weak candidate but Austin himself doesn't seem to have much of a backing or campaign infrastructure, so I don't know if the grassroots is really going to push him up enough to be a serious contender.\n\n3. **Peter Schiff - Connecticut, 2018**\n\n I think unfortunately his real chance was in 2010 when he could've defeated Richard Blumenthal.  In 2016, Blumenthal was reelected with a very wide margin.

Yet what Libertarians fail to realize is that not only is this statement incorrect, but it also provides an incredibly distasteful and extremist picture for their movement.  \n\nThe argument as to why taxation is theft posed by Libertarians is fairly simple; people *have* to pay taxes, and if they don't then they will be punished by the state in some manner, thus their income is not fully theirs and as dramatized by some Libertarians, forced over at gunpoint.  \n\nThis is viewing taxation in an incredibly atomized and vacuum-esque manner, a manner which simply doesn't exist in the real world. The government of The United States owns the borders of its own sovereign territory, it provides the defensive force for said sovereign territory, and operates the many courts and services which uphold and enforce property rights. Without the government of the United States the nation as you know it today would cease to exist. In this light paying taxes while earning income on US soil is a form of rent for using US services, protection, and sovereignty. If you don't agree with this approach you have the ability to exit the US at any time and move elsewhere. Taxation is the result of the social contract agreed upon by the state and people in every defined nation on the planet. \n\n&gt;Saying I can move anywhere doesn't make sense as taxes exist in every country.  \n\nThat doesn't make taxation any more theft, it is simply indicative that taxation is an omnipresent concept agreed upon by the vast majority of citizenry everywhere, the same way that not like any of the restaurants in your area doesn't mean you begrudgingly having to pay to eat at one is theft, or having to earn income to not starve is not wage slavery.  \n\n&gt;So you're saying the government owns you and your income?  \n\nNo, I'm saying the government owns the sovereign state and services which you operate on to earn an income, not much different from the rent someone would have to pay to operate a store in a strip mall.  \n\n&gt;Saying taxation is a result of a social contract is ridiculous, I didn't sign any such contract  \n\nThe social contract is not meant to be a physical tangible one that every single person ever born into a society run on taxes signs, it is a figurative one that the vast majority of people agree to either tacitly or explicitly which involves surrendering some freedoms to an entity of authority in order to carry on a long life not dominated by the short brutish violence and chaos that was dominant in hunter-gatherer societies.  \n \n&gt;Where should I go then if I don't want to pay taxes  \n\nLibertarians can purchase unclaimed land (it does exist), and form their own micronations where taxation doesn't exist and every action ever is completely voluntary. However, they shouldn't complain if a much more powerful entity decides to overtake their Libertopia. If Libertarians find this unfair or coercive or assert that all the meaningful land has already been bought up and owned, then they are having a conflict of interest with their own view of property rights.   \n\n&gt;The US used to not have any taxes!  \n\nThe US has always had some form of taxation since its direct founding, and the income tax was ruled constitutional in the sixteenth amendment:  \n\nArticle I, Section 8, Clause 1:\n\nThe Congress shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.  \n\n&gt;What if I want to abolish every single state institution in the US including borders and national defense and have everyone fight for themselves?  \n\nProperty would still be partitioned up and owned, through more violent means of course, and you would still end up paying taxes in the long run, to a mafia-like entity which swallows up large swaths of land then allows others to earn means on it. You would still have to pay taxes to entities operating now private roads, healthcare systems, insurance claims, etc.  \n\n&gt;Why is this phrase so harmful to the Libertarian movement?  \n\nIt's a praxelogical claim, an axiom which ignores empirical data and evidence and centers on rootless philosophical claims. It alienates Libertarians and makes them appear extreme to the average person, and forces them to contest the social contract concept which is tacitly agreed upon by the vast majority of voters and citizens. Libertarians should instead focus on countering taxes they find to be ineffective and unfair with empirically driven data showing their uselessness, such as city-wide soda/sugar taxes, or pointing out welfare traps where at certain points a bump in income results in someone paying *more* in taxes *and* having *less* money left over. \n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Taxation is not theft, and why Libertarians using the bumper sticker slogan harms their chances at political capital"}

Neither of these options are optimal, as you will see.\n\n\n------\n\n\n#Some Statistics of healthcare in the U.S and around the world\n\nWe should lay some groundwork first in the form of learning a bit on some of the issues we face in healthcare and the relevant statistics. This list is not to be taken as ubiquitous to *all* issues facing healthcare, its simply to name some of the biggest issues that can dispel a lot of the common myths the Left has bandied about around the internet and the media. Without further ado.\n\n* [This](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/life-expectancy-by-re/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) info graphic gives a good rundown of the differences in life expectancy by race in the United States, even down to the granular state level life expectancy statistics. The highest (national) life expectancy is among Asian Americans (86.5) followed by Latinos (82.8), Whites (78.9), Native Americans (76.9), and African Americans (74.6). Breaking it down this way tells us *potentially* two things, that lifestyle and genetics play a part in longevity. At current tech levels, Genetics cannot be helped in any great way, so our focus here should be on life style choices. These people are, save for income stratification, getting approximately the same care. That is people of the same income groups are getting roughly the same care in the United States regardless of race, and yet there is still a statistical disparity between the longevity of these [groups](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25526/). A Rational conclusion to take from this evidence is that a base line average life expectancy statistic cannot by itself be the final say of all matters on healthcare. This is why when leftists say America has \"worse outcomes\" it should be rebutted that Americans live a much less healthy lifestyle. Proof of this can be seen in the [obesity](http://www.economist.com/node/17118939) statistics by country. The fact that our life expectancy numbers are as high as they are is actually a strong argument *in favor* of more free market solutions to healthcare.\n\n\n* Although insurance coverage does not necessarily equate to healthcare servicing, Americans [had](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2017/demo/p60-260.html) a healthy rate of health coverage at approx 91% of the population covered. [**Most**](https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/julia-seymour/2007/07/18/40-million-uninsured-myth) of the rest choose not to get coverage for a variety of reasons. The real number of people who want or need coverage and would choose to do so given the resources is closer to 2-3 million (Less than 1% of the population), and not the 40-50 million claimed by people on the left like Michael Moore. Thats hardly an argument to get rid of the free market system.\n\n* [The United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/282401/density-of-magnetic-resonance-imaging-units-by-country/) is second in the world in the density of MRI's per capita. [The U.S](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2010/120.pdf) also does well with CT scanners per capita. [This](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2010/120.pdf) statistic has a little bit less utility because it aggregates data (page 6) by region instead of country, but as you can see from the data, the density of healthcare workers per capita is by far the highest in the Americas.\n\n* Its true, that even when adjusted for PPP and indexed to a year, the U.S still [spends](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.PCAP.PP.KD?year_high_desc=true) the most for healthcare of any nation, but as we will see further down the list, this may not necessarily be a bad thing. To summarize the reasons why here (and then go into detail later) it should suffice to say that Single Payer systems simply have different forms of rationing other than prices (mostly lines/higher wait times). Also we should not forget about the dead weight loss aspects of a single payer system. \n\n* [since](https://www.heritage.org/health-care-reform/report/the-2017-health-insurance-exchanges-major-decrease-competition-and-choice) Obamacare came into existence the number of healthcare insurance providers has been decreasing, a forgone conclusion of oligopolistic intervention on the part of government. According to the link 70% of Americans now live in regions where there is only one insurance provider, or two at best (monopolies and duopolies). The ironic thing here is that Obamacare was supposed to *increase* competition. It did no such thing.\n\n* The United States actually has a natural experiment running wherein we have a single payer system within the United States running side by side with the free market system. The Veterans Administration, or VA, is a single payer system. [300,000](https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/02/politics/va-inspector-general-report/index.html) veterans died *waiting* for care. As we briefly discussed earlier, single payer systems simply replace one form of rationing (prices) with another (lines). Extrapolated to the United States population (admittedly a back of the envelope calculation) This would result in the needless death of 4.36 million Americans over the same time period.\n\n* Spending on healthcare in the United States differs by region, even when the same healthcare program is considered. Consider [Medicare](https://www.brookings.edu/research/six-economic-facts-about-health-care-and-health-insurance-markets-after-the-affordable-care-act/), where it is 70% more expensive to treat someone in Miami than it is in Minneapolis. Some regions of the U.S are much below the U.S average in terms of per capita health care spending. \n\n----\n\n# Economics of Healthcare\n\nMost of us are familiar with the term \"Monopoly\". It is a situation where there is one seller of goods/services and many buyers. What most people have never heard of is a \"Monopsony\", which is the opposite situation where there is one buyer and many sellers. Single Payer systems are essentially a Monopsony (Hence Single Payer). A summary of this is that the Monopsony, by virtue of its price setting power, lowers costs. However this has predictable results in the form of deadweight loss on the economy and less quantity supplied. The problem with this is that the laws of economics cannot really be broken. Everything in an economy is rationed in some way, and in a market economy prices do the rationing. \n\nHowever, in a situation like this when the underlying demand and supply structure of the market stay the same, and *prices* are controlled in some fashion (in this case by price setting power of the single payer of services) a new form of rationing must occur. \n\n\n[This](http://webnt.calhoun.edu/distance/internet/business/eco231/downloads/lnc4.pdf) gives a good outlay of the different types of rationing there are. Without prices, these new less efficient ways of rationing occur. We can see this in the form of long wait times in most single payer countries. \n\n[Here](http://www.americanthinker.com/legacy_assets/articles/old_root/monopsonistic_outcome.jpg) we can see a graphical representation of a monopsonistic market structure. \n\n[Here](http://www.americanthinker.com/legacy_assets/articles/old_root/monopsonistic_outcome_adjusted.jpg) again\n\n\n\n[This](http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2010/10/the_problem_with_a_health_care.html) link does a good job of explaining the graphs used. \n\n\n\n----\n\n# Proposed Solutions\n\n* Allow importation of drugs and medical services/devices (huge Deal)\n* Allow competition across state lines for health insurance (Huge deal)\n* End the practice where local hospitals can veto the establishment of new hospitals ( Called Certificates of public need)\n* reduce or streamline the licensing requirements for certain healthcare practitioners\n* End all taxes on medicine and healthcare\n* Change from allowing companies to have 20 year monopolies after a drug is designed to instead have a bounty system allowing generics and name brand competitors to compete right away.\n* reduce the threshold for over the counter drugs\n* Increase immigration for healthcare workers and doctors especially\n* Allow for tax privileged health savings accounts that can be used for yourself or family members (can be invested in equities).\n* Get rid of all price caps and price controls so that the *long term* supply equilibrium is met, stabilizing costs. \n* implement policies that increase full employment so that people can more likely afford healthcare through policies like eliminating the corporate tax, reducing income taxes, and getting rid of capital gains taxes and estate taxes.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Free Market Healthcare Solutions: A discussion"}

I think that a socialist approach to health care is the way to go though, not that its the best approach to everything. My thought process so far is that the supply on your life is very low. (you have only one lol) \nSo this would cause the demand to be extremely high. I think this allows for people to be exploited when faced with life or death situations such as cancer and chemotherapy. This then leads them to do whatever to get the medication. They then sell off everything they own and if they even survive, they are shackled with debt and I believe this keeps them from buying a home, new care, etc. I think if the U.S. government was able to represent us as a whole it would allow us more leverage. I also want to add that people might say that why should we pay for your medical bills. Well I don't have kids so why should I pay for schools.

It is completely binary. Finland has universal healthcare. You might be interested to know that I use mostly private healthcare services. How could this be? Well the public option is pretty good. And because it is basically free to the user(I know taxes pay for it), it drives the prices massively down in the private sector. A private doctors appointment costs like 50 euros in Finland. There are pretty much no lines, because a lot of people use public hospitals. Large medical operations like heart surgery are mostly done through public funding in public hospitals in this system. Comparatively Countries like Finland spend way less money per person on healthcare than the US (Both public and private sector spending included). Mostly when people talk about universal healthcare they seem to think the private sector will just disappear and at least in my experience that is not the case. Most companies for example still contract private health services for work related healthcare. What are your thoughts on hybrid systems like this?

As such, we truly believe in spontaneous order and don't formally regulate content\"\n\nSurely, libertarianism is about property rights and not some nebulous abstraction of spontaneous order? That is, you have spontaneous order in the *context* of enforcing property rights (or possessive rights if a mutualist), not as a boundless abstraction. The idea is that if you hold to a few simple rules, spontaneous order can emerge around those rules, such as property rights. You don't need to micromanage each interaction to get order, because people's preferences can be expressed through these rights, and mitigating factors such as risk/reward trade-offs and people's reputations being on the line exist to provide feedback. The \"spontaneous order\" emerges as a collective consequence of the planned order over property.\n\nThe libertarian position on free speech is that nobody should have the right to involuntarily overrule people's property rights. This means that the government can't blanket censor people. However, the corollary of this is that people's property rights give them freedom of association, which logically includes freedom of disassociation, which means that they can impose whatever rules they want on their own property. It's impossible to have a society completely free of \"censorship\" and a not strawmanned libertarianism doesn't even aim for that; it aims to restrict censorship to clearly defined property.\n\nSo long story short, since Reddit has property rights, and is delegating down some usage rights to subreddit owners, and those rights include the right to moderate, there could in fact be very strict moderation of a libertarian subreddit. In fact, I'd argue that since the notion that a libertarian subreddit must necessarily have light or no moderation to be principled is based on a strawman misunderstanding of libertarian principles, a libertarian subreddit should aim to be as strict as the average subreddit, as this is the moderation level that has been proven to work by tradition. Trying to be super duper free in a totally abstract groundless way is just asking for deliberate trolling to force you to break your supposed principles.\n\nThe wider application of this is that libertarian organizations in general shouldn't be meta-libertarian and promote non-property (or non-possessive) based notions of freedom, since these notions are fundamentally incoherent and self-detonating. It also spreads a distorted perception of what libertarianism is.\n\n ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Isn't this actually a weird position for a libertarian board to have?"}

Taxes/Management/Cost/Audit&amp;Forensic/Financial are the main branches you can find.\n\nThere are 3 main types for businesses under Financial Accounting.\n\nService industry : where they use the simplest for of accounting. This is any business that renders a service and does not sell goods.\n\nCommercial industry : where a company buys and resell goods at a profit.\n\nIndustrial/manufacturing industry : where a company produces goods from raw material and directly sells it or sells it to a commercial company.\n\nThere are three categories of stocks in we'll call it \"industrial accounting\". You have you Raw Material Stocks, your Products in course of manufacture (goes by slightly different name in many places), and your Finished Stocks which are the stocks that are waiting to be shipped or sold.\n\nIn Management/cost accounting there exists a financial statement that isn't public : cost of production.\n\nUnder this statements you'll find what makes the cost of production that you'll find in the public statement of income (that is regulated by the IFRS for public companies) from a manufacturing company. Of course the cost of production statement is private and never shown to anyone but accounting people, engineers, marketing, c-suit, and a few large shareholders sitting on the board, because it's sensitive information in a competitive market.\n\nLets introduce a new notion. The notion of incorporable costs/expenses also known as Stock Costs. Meaning the expenses can be put in the cost of production of a good. This is REALLY IMPORTANT to get. The value of a good on the books until it is sold is the sum of all incorporable costs that went in it.\n\nWhat makes up the cost of production, or cost of goods, or any other name you could see referring to it is three things :\n\n**Raw Material Stocks/Costs**\n\nThese are self explanatory and divided into two sub-categories. Raw Materials and Indirect Supplies. Think about wood planks, screws, nails, bolts, sheet metal, etc. \n\n**Direct Labor Costs**\n\nThis is the labor of any worker in the company that is directly associated with producing a specific good. Lets take a company making tables as an example from now on. The workers in charge of making the table top and legs and working to cut/sand/pre-drill holes/working machinery/etc. make up that Direct Labor costs.\n\n**General Manufacturing Costs**\n\nThis is any expenses to keep the specific machinery/manufacture running.\n\n**Indirect Labor Costs**\n\nThis is any labor that is not directly used in producing goods but is needed to keep the manufacture running. Lets think about ganitorial staff. Those costs are included in the General Manufacturing Costs.\n\nNow, Socialists and Communist always whine about not having the full value of their labor compensated. However, they don't even know how it works in the real world.\n\nIn the real world, the value of goods produced by a company is the value of the accumulated **incorporable costs**. This means that on the books the value of a good is **never** listed as the listed price of the goods that the marketing department calculates for the clients.\n\nWhy? Because this price is determined by the market and not the company. It can fluctuate wildly from one customer to another (depending on the laws, some places don't allow discriminatory pricing), and through time.\n\nSo when you are paid for you labor, that costs is incorporated into the costs of the Stocks under production and therefore make up the costs of the Finished Stocks waiting to be sold.\n\nThis is the Theory of Costs that determines accounting throughout the **whole world** which IFRS apply and regulate.\n\nThis means that if you lose stocks in a fire, you cannot claim the MSRP price to your insurance, you can only claim the book value of the stocks. They can only get compensated on the real value of the goods.\n\nWhen a company compensates the value of the labor of a worker, it is compensated fully and incorporated into the manufacturing costs. Since the good as no more value than the combined value of incorporable costs.\n\nThe worker doesn't have to take on the risks associated with producing those goods. They do not take the risk of storing those goods. They do not take the risk of shipping those goods. They do not take the risk of marketing those goods. They do not take on the risk of managing the company. They do not take on the risk of failing to deliver the goods as is advertised.\n\nThe labor has been fully compensated.\n\n**Furthermore**\n\nYou probably didn't know that. But not all the labor of a worker is even ADMISSIBLE as an incorporable costs/expenses. This includes the downtime you are paid to do nothing when the machinery stops working. It includes Overtime compensation. Those things are to be put directly in the statement of income and CANNOT make up the value of goods.\n\nSo you are even compensated for work you are not even providing value for.\n\nIf you work in administrative roles to run the rest of the company, those costs aren't incorporable either. The value you provide is a cost for the company and you provide no value to customers. The costs of running the business itself aren't incorporable.\n\nThe profits is given to those who take on the risks of the enterprise, because without someone taking on the risks there would not be a venture. Either the shareholders, the business owner, the workers (under a co-op), and the company itself (as a moral entity). It is not attributable to anyone in the company for their work, because profit is not a function of the work provided by workers in the company. It is a reward from risks not a function of costs because those costs are something different than the price at which the good is sold. \n\nWhen a company loses stocks in an accident or underperforms, you probably don't have to give money back to the company.\n\nAs a worker, you are a costs/expense of the company. Just like the CEO or any other worker is a cost/expense of the company. The company doesn't derive profit from value that it does not compensate for to its workers, it gets profits from the risk it takes in paying the costs of running the business.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"For people making the argument that profit comes solely from the labor of the workers.

{"author":"Musicrafter","created_utc":1518479824,"num_comments":0,"score":2,"selftext":"Spending multiplier: the phenomenon that any particular dollar, once it is spent a single time initially, is spent over and over again, enabling a \"multiplicative\" effect on GDP.\n\nThe multiplier's effect is calculated by summing a converging infinite series. It's a classic geometric series based on powers of MPC&lt;1 with a well known limit formula that ends up mathematically working out to the mysterious 1/MPS we all learn in basic econ. But because the series is infinite, although its individual terms converge on zero causing the limit to approach a finite value, the multiplier effect theoretically takes an infinite amount of time to fully play out. Even if human inconsistencies result in premature termination of the sequence, when a multitude of individuals in deep iterations have individual MPC's of 0 at that income level, it still takes a long time, since the iterations can only occur as fast as the velocity of money, which is a finite number.\n\nAll savings is future spending. We do not save for no reason; it is simply delayed spending. Thus, the long-run MPS is always equal to 0, the long-run MPC is always 1, and thus the long-run spending multiplier is always nonsensically \u221e. Using short-run variables doesn't make sense because the series theoretically takes an infinite amount of time to occur. Keynesians usually place great importance on the variable of time, but here they critically neglect it, as well as neglecting the fact that savings don't just evaporate into thin air but are all re-injected into the economy later.\n\nIn order to make any sense out of the spending multiplier, we would have to establish an upper limit to sum a finite series. Perhaps a reasonable limit would be the iteration corresponding to the average amount of time a saved dollar remains unspent. But this means the popularly understood spending multiplier calculation leaves out key information that could significantly alter its true value. Even so, it would cease to be a mathematical law, instead becoming a mere approximation. The spending multiplier is a very real effect, but the way Keynesians employ it is faulty.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Problems with the Keynesian Multiplier"}

People who act like they're humanitarians don't take into account that mass immigration barely does anything to stop the world poverty rate. Additionally, we often take some of the brightest minds who could have helped improve their own countries instead. The elite tend to love mass immigration, as it puts middle-low class workers out of jobs, and allows the rich to exploit cheap labor.\n\nLet's say we allowed anyone who wanted to come into this country, regardless of the amount. The just wouldn't be pragmatic. The United States has around 300 million citizens. What if we allowed 3 billion people to come all at once? Overpopulation is bound to be an issue if anyone can just freely come here.\n\nJust to be perfectly clear, as a lot of people tend to erroneously infer racism when taking about the practical matter of X amount of land for Y amount of people. I completely support immigrants of all nations to come here legally. I'm just saying we need to be realistic and set a cap for how many immigrants can come each year, simply because of the impact of too many people coming all at once.

It instead advocates for deep government intervention where government lowers interest rates to sometimes even a negative real interest rate and organizes investors to all working together in different parts of an industry.  When there are multiple modern firms in the market, the increased wages paid at one firm provide additional demand for other firms' goods and vice versa, allowing the firms to operate profitably together when they never would have before.  \n\nSo while this may seem pretty nebulous in theory, it's worked pretty well for developing nations in the past.  2 examples that jump to mind are the 19 point plan in Taiwan, where government provided massive tax incentives to investment and 5 year plans in S. Korea.  These countries are now economic powerhouses when before they were developing countries because the plans worked quite well and pushed their economy from developing to developed.  \n\nBasically, deep government intervention in the economies drove them into industrialization and development where later on the incentives could be relaxed and these economies could flourish under more capitalist, free-market policies where before they couldn't. \n\nI know libertarian economic policy advocates for the restriction of government intervention but it seems like in certain cases for less developed economies government intervention at a very deep level can be tremendously beneficial for an economy.  How do we interact with this and does it provide a convincing argument against libertarian philosophy for certain countries?

They formed communities that didn't revolve around building mud hunts, cannibalism, and killing other niggers.\n3. Proper discipline and manners. If a nigger got \"moufy\" or uppity, it could expect an hours long flogging for its insubordinance. This made for a nigger that kept its mouth shut and only spoke when it needed to. It had to resist its jungle impulses or pay the price. \n4.They knew their place in the heirarchy. Unlike their pompous descendants, Your average field nigger knew what the ramifications for TNB was. If its massa so much as caught it glancing at a white southernbelle it would suffer harsh penalties. If a nigger worked hard or won the massa's favor then it'd earn itself the position of \"house nigger\", in which it was allowed to live and dwell in their lord's very own home but they still fully understood that they were niggers and had just as much worth as the family dog. \n5. Stronger genetics. Pure bred niggers in africa are far weaker than their american cousins, new world niggers were bred according to their strength and endurance, which'd later come as a detriment to later human generations. As result of this selective breeding, Niggers are now able to compete with whites in modern contact sports thus they have the white man to thank for giving them their only significant skillset besides destroying civilization.\n6. A father. Unlike their bastard descendants, Nigger fathers were bound to always be in the same cabin as their nigger offspring. 'Ol tyrone had nowhere to run back in the good ol days. Unless they were sold off, a nigger was always guaranteed to be able to spot its sire in the cotton fields on father's day. \n7. A purpose. Before slavery, The nigger freely roamed the jungles of sub-saharan africa without a care in the world. Content with loafing around and dancing with its kin around a fire every night. This was the niggers way of life for probably 100,000 years before the white man came. When the slave arrived in america, it was branded and its lazy ass was put straight to work. It contributed to an economy and society far beyond its comprehension. All it knew was that it woke up and it did nothing but productive task all day, From dawn to dusk, knowing that that if it worked real hard it might get a cot in massa's big mud hut. \n8.Segregation/Apartheid was also good for niggers. SA flourished under white rule, and the niggers had better living conditions without even having to go through slavery. To this day niggers beg for whites to come back and get their shithole in shape.\n9. Nigger slaves were healthier and obesity was uncommon. Again, Nigger slaves were only given as much food as they needed. Their bodies had grown strong from the selective breeding, repeated lashings, and continuous labor. This gave them a robust constution and all the weak and sickly niggers who weren't strong enough to endure slavery simply died off from natural selection. All this went down the drain when they were unchained and became free to indulge in their degenerate desires for muh-dik and laziness.\n10. Safety and Security. They no longer had to worry about suprise village raids from other nigger, Running from lions, or being the nigger sacrifice of the week for some voodoo ritual. They could sleep comfortably in their cabins knowing that all they had to worry about was picking dat cotton and pushin dem carts less massa gave em a whippins.\n\nAs a black man, I think that today\u2019s niggers need to shut the fuck up and stop being so bitchy about slavery. If the white man didn\u2019t enslave our ancestors, we would all be stuck in the uncivilized Africa.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why slavery was good for black people"}

I've considered myself a libertarian for years and often find it fairlu easy to defend my views that are often inline with libertarian ideals. During last year's election Gary Johnson seemed to line up totally opposite of my immigration views. He is to pro immigration (which I agree with as long as they are beneficial to our society or refugees in serious need). However he seemed to have issue with the term illegal immigration. My thought has always been it's illegal because they arent following our laws to join our country. Also that we shouldn't allow whomever wants to come to come and stay. \n\nThe previous information was more to illustrate what brings me to questioning how libertarian I am. As I mentioned I line up with libertarianism on almost everything. However with immigration I think this should be a power strongly held by the federal government. It's a means to protect the rights of US citizens and ensure sovreignity. I guess I just want to know how you all feel on this.  It has me questioning am I outside of traditional libertarianism with this opinion? Are many libertarians closer to Johnson that takes the more PC approach?\n\nNot meaning to debate unless you want ;) Just checking how you all line up on this.\n\nEDIT: Yal really downvoting me trying to see what ur individual opinions are and how I line up?

I think immigrants do a lot for this country and are a vital part of society. I feel there should be a path to citizenship. Libertarian view to my understanding is open borders which I can't get behind because that will saturate the job market.

And guess who will own all these robots? People with money, of course. As this happens, capital will become ever more powerful and labor will become ever more worthless. Those without money\u2014most of us\u2014will live on whatever crumbs the owners of capital allow us.\" Having a background of education in  both economics (which is partly why I'm a little-\"L\" Libertarian - people aren't rational) and entrepreneurship I understand that \"money\" flows towards creators of wealth, as well as the economies of scale. I look at the current wealth distributions in the US, and whether \"earned\" or \"undeserved\", the huge gap means that those in the top 25% have a real and substantial way to out-compete the commonfolk as the robots become more available. I fear that Libertarianism will become completely nonviable as the need to reduce a growing gap in wealth manifests itself in more \"big government\" programs and policies. And a sad, scared part of me WANTS that protection, too... So I can only imagine if I, being my liberty-leaning self, am leaning that way how more big-government-inclined people will feel. \n\nMy personal brand of little-\"L\" Libertarianism stems from my ability to provide for myself (and by extension, the ability of others to be able to reasonably provide for themselves). Take that away with robotic labor and how does Libertarianism survive? If people don't have a way to lift themselves up, which is primarily through their ability to perform labor, sure there are aspects of Libertarianism that will still work but I don't see it being an entirely viable ideology. I'm not even really yet sure if it's a future I want to be a part of. \n\nFor those interested in where I am informing my perspective from:\n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/05/robots-artificial-intelligence-jobs-automation/\n\nhttps://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/08/rise-of-the-robots/\n\nhttp://money.cnn.com/2017/11/03/news/economy/wealth-gap-america/index.html\n\nhttps://qz.com/185945/drones-are-about-to-upheave-society-in-a-way-we-havent-seen-in-700-years/\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/24/robots-future-work-humans-jobs-leisure\n\nhttps://qz.com/940977/no-one-is-prepared-to-stop-the-robot-onslaught-so-what-will-we-do-when-it-arrives/\n\nAnd of course: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUyU3lKzoio\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Reconciling a robotic future with Libertarianism"}

{"author":"Gohmbo","created_utc":1518718864,"num_comments":3,"score":0,"selftext":"Let's make this simple. It's not a good thing. Appropriation is seperation by accordance. In nature, appropriation is to see an African, and label them so by acknowledging the color of one's skin, and the same may be said about one of European descent. According to who you are born from, the color of your skin, as well as other possible features, indicate your race. \n\nTo assign appropriation to a culture is to deem what is right or good for a specific culture. But who says that any culture needs to be upheld by a specific race? And who is to say what is appropriate for any specific culture? Part of any culture is progress. We progress through observation. \n\nIn Freudian psychology, it is stated that all that we do is for the sake of mating. So, using this template, one begins to see that we take from another culture what we see as necessary in order to mate. This is a type of assimilation. \"Mockery is the highest form of flattery.\" Not to say that I believe we use it for the sake of mating, but assimilation is a good thing. It is the acknowledgement, acceptance, and development of specific features in one culture into an overall society. \n\nTo state that one culture is \"not allowed\" for the other's sacred \"protection\" is a form of reverse racism. I'm angered by the fact that so many people think that it is wrong for a white person to do something that one of another race does. It is the same as saying the action is below or above the race in question. Nobody is \"too white\" for anything (except maybe me when it comes to dancing, My body has no rhythm). And vice versa. To say a black man is \"too white\" because he wears glasses and has a nasal dysfunction that impeeds his speech is another example of cultural appropriation. Our society is being divided by this reverse racism. \n\nThis brings me to another point. Reverse racism is still racism. When something moves in reverse, or backwards, it does not mean the concept of it has changed, only its direction. A shift of the finger that points blame (not blame, this is just a metaphor because of a lack of better words). History repeats itself when lessons are not learned. One major elephant in the room is cultural grudge African Americans hold against white people. \n\nLet's face the facts. Yes, there are plenty of white people that are still racist. And yes, it's awful and slavery was an atrocious attack on the basic human rights of black people. Ask just about anyone in our current society, and they will agree. The people of the present are not responsible for the actions of the people of the past. A child is not imprisoned because his parents were psychopaths. Is it right to hold the future accountable for the past? No. One may say it is appropriate to do the opposite. But the past should not be a chalkboard upon which we draw our lines. \n\nThe past is a teacher. We are to learn our lessons from it, not hold it accountable. It is the people of the past that have done these things. But we are the people of the present. We are the student. Yet many on either side of this ongoing argument fail to learn anything at all. See, the past has told us there is a line, and we choose to stand on either side of it. Turn this line sideways, and imagine it has turned into a square. A two-dimensional box. No matter where you decide to make your point, when it is turned, you discover you are trapped within this box. \n\nWe have to learn to escape it. Because it is not on the chalkboard that future is born. It comes from the actions we take. The chalkboard is where we are told how a liquid - like water for example - became a solid. It was frozen into place. But the present is in fact a liquid. Malleable, flexible, and ready to go where we take it. And if a gas is like the future, this means it is unformed, yet contained how we choose for it to be. \n\nMy main point in this post is that those who allow themselves to be shaped by the ones who are frozen are no longer in the present. They are stuck like a dot on a chalkboard. This goes for any individual of any race. Hate is the freezing of our minds, refusing to be shaped further because it has stamped itself into one place, stuck on the actions of the past. An example of this is a grudge. Regardless of where you descended from, I can assure the name of the place was Earth. And regardless of what race you are from, I can assure you that your species is human. \n\nI am not ignorant to the current systematic atrocities many people currently endure. In fact, I'm hyper sensitive to them - you could say I am super sane. What I mean is, the overall focus is towards the oppression of black people  who are stuck in neighborhoods and daily horrors that are very difficult to escape from. However, this is only the surface. The deeper goal of this system is to actually create unrest between all people. While I speak of black and white people in this post, what I am claiming now is that all races are pitted against each other, because there is no better way to seperate people than to foster hate. \n\nI'm from a ghetto in the south. Whenever a fight occured between a black kid and a white kid in school, it was automatically labeled racial hatred, regardless of the individuals in question who's motives were much more personal. \n\nWe should also acknowledge that black on black crime is at such a high rate as it is because of the pressures of living in unsafe and underdeveloped neighborhoods. Why don't we ask why these neighborhoods have yet to be improved upon? Not because black people don't want it. No person wishes to live in fear of their own life. Neither do most people wish to create a living from the suffering of others. And those that do were conditioned that way. Your neighbor is not your enemy, he is your ally. Yet two people, when they are pitted against one another, rightfully feel the need to survive, which is much greater in most than the acceptance of another's goals overtaking their own. \n\nWe all bleed, and our blood is the same color. The only person truly separating you from those around is yourself, conditioned to behave in such a way, regardless of your race. That is how division of a society is strongest. But we are one country. One species. We all have talents, and every one of us is important. We need each other. Those that cause pain in our lives develop our goals in that they inspire us not to share the same experience. \n\nVengeance is not justice. Vengeance is the corrupt form. It is an act violence stemming from a previous one, simply proving that our lesson has not been learned. When will we see that violence only leads to more of the same? I love my brothers of blood, regardless of their race, age, or past action. I refuse to blame a person for falling victim to these systemic manipulations, because they have become \"assimilated\" into our society throughout ages. \n\nI challenge anyone to prove me wrong in that cultural appropriation is bad. How can it be good? It is only more of the same story, warped to encapture the eyes of the present, because we think we are smarter than the people of the past. \n\nA white person that claims another of their race is wrong in assimilating with another race is merely another dot, stuck in their box. These are the type that are ignorant to progress within themselves. I speak from personal experience. I used to believe that as a white person, I should not strive to act in any way that not \"culturally appropriate.\" Not out of hatred, but because I truly thought that it was foolish to try to be something that the color of my skin does not signify.\n\nI was blind to the fact that the color of my skin does not dictate my actions. Whether your black or white growing up in a ghetto, you deal with the same hardships. Yes, me being white does not give any sort of upperhand, beyond that of the close-minded opinions of racist white people, who I currently and have always viewed as pitiful, though I do not wish to die feeling this way.\n\nThose who believe they have upperhand when they do not are the ones that fall hardest. Truly nobody that is racist has the upperhand. They are merely victims of our past. We should not give in to the mentality of victimhood. We need to be united. In almost every religion it is stated that before we may become one with divinity, we must become one within ourselves. We also must become one with our surroundings. All people in your life are a part of that equation. \n\nI'm not some crazy religious person saying we should strive to be divine, but when did we decide that treating others the way we want to be treated was laughable and wrong? My end goal is to see hate evaporate forever. This includes personal fueds and even hate against a system that turns a group on itself and an individual upon their own mind, but at the very least we have to start here. \n\nI get it. Nobody wants to be labeled as the punk that put down their pitchfork. Labeled as the fool of their community. But when a whole community acts out of foolishness, only the individual who is not afraid to be labeled by clowns as a jester are the righteous. If this was hard to follow, ask about a specific point and I will attempt to explain in a more understandable way. I am slightly scatterbrained, but I am patient. I want this message to clearly ring in everyone's ears.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Cultural Appropriation: The New Divider"}

I\u2019ve perused the wiki and haven\u2019t seen these issues covered.  It is possible I just missed them however, so feel free to send me a link.  It\u2019s hard to believe this hasn\u2019t come up before, so forgive me if this is a frequent topic.  If so, I\u2019ll erase this and you can [ring a bell and shame me](https://vimeo.com/162566435).\n\nI gather, from my cursory understanding of libertarian thought, that the core tenets are the following:  That no group of individuals should be allowed the right to do violence upon another individual or group of individuals unless *to prevent them* from doing violence.  Also, that markets are superior to human planning when it comes to organizing our society.\n\nI can get behind the idea that markets are a decent way to organize society when compared to the alternatives of socialism and feudalism.  But there are some areas in which I do not believe markets are beneficial.\n\nFirst, so called natural monopolies.  By a natural monopoly, I mean underground water or sewage pipes, the electrical grid, or maybe even radio frequencies.  Markets where there are massive network effects which create financial barriers to the entry of competitors which allow the victorious entity to raise prices considerably.  Consider plumbing, for example.  Once an underground network has been laid, it is far less expensive for the currently existing entity to update or add new customers than it would be for a new entity to lay a new plumbing network.  The cost for a new entity would be so prohibitively high that a competitive water rate for the original entity is much higher than is beneficial for the wellbeing of the community.  I think we can all agree that easy access to clean water is something that has extremely beneficial externalities which should be maintained.  If I\u2019m paying $200 per month for water, which I would definitely pay because water is essential, then that\u2019s $150 that I no longer have to spend on other items. I become less free than I would be if the government regulates rates.\n\nAdditionally, private entities obeying nothing but market forces have no incentive to conserve, which has damaging effects for communities in drought stricken areas like California.\n\nI\u2019ve written more extensively about it [here](https://inmostcity.com/index.php/2018/02/08/privatizing-public-assets/).  You can skip everything except the sections labeled **But the problem with public utility privatization** and **Despite these realities, local governments often fall prey to short term thinking**.  I\u2019ve read the [Mises article \u201cThe Myth of Natural Monopoly\u201d](https://mises.org/library/myth-natural-monopoly).  Frankly, I did not find it a very compelling argument.  It essentially just said that government regulation is worse than markets without addressing the issues I brought up above.\n\nThe second problem I find with libertarian thought comes at the limits of rational behavior for human individuals.  I\u2019ll give you two examples where I think free markets defined by individual choice lead to worse outcomes than regulated markets.\nFirst, take for example my father\u2019s career.  He was a heavy equipment operator and construction worker.  The job was incredibly hard on his body, and he currently deals with many orthopedic problems: a bad back, neck, arthritis in his shoulders, etc.  There\u2019s no doubt that his years working manual labor have led to his current condition.  Fortunately, he was in a union which allowed him higher wages, a pension plan, and health benefits.  I have no doubt that, if not for the union, he would have been willing to work for $12 an hour without any of those benefits.  He was a 24 year old high school dropout with a wife and son when starting the job and would not have taken into consideration the long term effects on his body when negotiating a salary.  There were limits to his rationality when it came to this choice.\n\n\nHere\u2019s a more general analogy using ice hockey as an example.  Let\u2019s say for the sake of argument that hockey players who play WITHOUT a helmet are faster and better than hockey players who play WITH a helmet.  They can just see the puck better, score slightly more goals, and win more championships.  In a competitive market, players **with** helmets would be competed out of existence by players **without** helmets until the whole league would be helmetless.  Unfortunately, once this happens the incidence of brain damage and head injury would increase.  The sport would become more dangerous for every player thanks to individual competition.  The community would suffer.  Careers would be shorter and the player\u2019s wives and children would be forced into caring for their brain damaged husbands and fathers.  By impinging upon the freedom of these players and forcing them to wear helmets, everybody becomes safer and the community is better off for it.  We reduce negative externalities which cost more in the long term than what we might gain by higher efficiency hockey.\n\nThese seem like reasonable limits to libertarian ideals.  Can you point me towards any flaws in my thinking?  I get that it\u2019s difficult for humans to regulate markets effectively.  But does that really mean we should just not try at all?\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The limits of libertarianism. I'm looking for some pushback against my ideas."}

(This is totally fine; we're obviously not Libertarians because we like voting for the most popular candidate.)  I think, though, that we need an articulate principled position on this matter. The argument \"We need guns to prevent a tyranny\" doesn't seem to hold much water since there are several other countries that aren't tyrannies but have increased gun control (e.g. Australia) and since the weapons of the military far exceed the deadliness of anything permitted to individuals (e.g. F16 jets, Apache helicopters, Bradley tanks with corresponding ammunition for their weapons.). At the moment, I'm not sure what that principled stance is.\n\nOne idea: we have the technology to imprint unique identifiers onto bullets.  That way, if a crime is committed, we can provide police with the knowledge of who purchased the round.

These white people are annoying as shit, pretending to care about our rights, but they vote for the democrats that contribute to the destruction of the black community. Look at what happened to Detroit, the welfare state and strict gun laws crippled Detroit, and the democrat economic policies crippled the economy so much that the niggers either became reliant on government handouts or turned to a life of crime, being poor as shit due to the democrats destroying the economy. The only reason they have black friends is so they can say \u201cI\u2019m not racist, I have a black friend\u201d, and so they can keep up the facade in this politically correct society.\n\nDemocrats want to keep the nigger down and reliant on their handouts, which is why they have been destroying our communities with the welfare state. They are also dividing us by founding movements like BLM, which is actually an anti black movement and doesn\u2019t give a shit about black power. BLM takes money from George Soros, who is a globalist white cracker piece of shit that wants to systemically destroy the black community. \n\nMalcom X would have rightfully called BLM race traitors that are being played a political chump by the democrats. Here is a quote from the white trash piece of shit democrat LBJ \u201cI\u2019ll have those niggers voting democrat for the next 200 years\u201d. \n\nNigger- it is the most powerful and loaded term in the english language. Let\u2019s take a look at who gave it so much power, and why they did, and why it\u2019s still so powerful today. Nigger was originally nothing more than a variation of the Spanish term \u201cnegro\u201d. However, the white slave owners adopted this term, and they used it as a term to dehumanize black people. They would say nigger while whipping them, and often the last word enslaved blacks would hear is \u201cnigger\u201d before being killed.\n\n Political correctness is used as a tool by the white man to mentally enslave us. White people are responsible for giving the term nigger power in the first place, and they are still giving it power, because they want to be able to hurt us. If we refer to ourselves as niggers and stop giving a shit about those white pieces of shit that use it, nigger won\u2019t be powerful anymore. Black people should not encourage white people to say nigger, but we should also not react to it, as reacting to it gives whitey that much more power over you. White people always want a reason or justification to say nigger, because they don\u2019t want black people to band together over oppression faced from whites. \n\nThe main enemy and oppressors of the niggers in this country are white people and democrats. The only way to save the black community is to vote for republicans like Ben Carson. Unfortunately republican niggers are often labeled an \u201cUncle Tom\u201d or \u201csellout\u201d by democrat niggers, as democrat niggers are stuck on the democrat plantation, where whitey twists and distorts reality so much that they start to believe that democrats and white people are the only ones who can save them, yet the truth is that republican niggers like Ben Carson, Thomas Sowell, Larry Elder, etc want independence for the black community, and they actually want to address all the problems in the black community, even if it means taking responsibility rather than being reliant on whitey for welfare checks. The reality is that people who are calling black republicans \u201cUncle Tom\u201d and \u201csellout\u201d are race traitors themselves, just like Malcom X said. \n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The truth about BLM, the welfare state, the term \u201cnigger\u201d, white people, and the black community"}

When the seasonal job ended around Christmas, I filed for unemployment, and was initially approved.

{"author":"machin3l3arning","created_utc":1518852542,"num_comments":1,"score":0,"selftext":"tldr; destroy me for being a centrist \"civil libertarian\"\n\nIt seems to me that inequality today is largely a product of tacit collaboration between private interests and government initiatives to financialize the economy. Most notably in the United States, these corroborative measures stimulated mass capital pooling in the stock market, insurance and real estate industry. This process grew inherent to American capitalism, as people could realize profits through investing in stocks with an ever-increasing and heavily taxed capital pool. It was a win-win for the investing man and tax collector alike, a grand relationship that blossomed into a financial revolution. Yet like any transactional marketplace, some end up with less and others with more. In the long run, only individuals with high levels of initial capital emerge profitable, ergo claims like Piketty\u2019s \u201crates of return on capital exceed the overall economic growth rate\u201d as explanations for wealth inequality. This construct can be deduced as the framework underlying capitalist business cycles. With ever-shifting demand, the capital circulating these esteemed markets is a function of all wealth invested by individuals minus the aggregate tax/regulatory stake at the particular time. In periods of modest inflation, all individuals have proportionally equal opportunity to succeed and profit. This was the idea underpinning war debt and securities exchanges. Before WWI, Woodrow Wilson revolutionized the capitalist model by offering the common man an affordable investment vehicle, stamping war bonds as \u201cpatriotic and profitable\u201d. Yet modest expansion of the economy eventually breeds an oversaturated market and leads to devaluation of financial commodities. This is the capitalist spirit of the shampoo economy: bubble, bust, repeat. In deflationary periods, this materializes as a zero-sum game. Only those with a disproportionate amount of initial capital benefit, as the common investor will liquidate and inequalities deepen. The massive capital pool underlying economic growth is then the fruit of a mechanical cycle of expansion and contraction. Look not at the laborer\u2019s relation to the means, but to the gardener controlling the tools of this fruit trade to see the relation between wealth and equity. Given that capital begets capital, expansion breeds overinvestment and contraction disproportionately harms the average investor. As such, the majority of inequalities we recognize in modern society are intimately tied to financial markets underpinning the capitalist mode. While capital deepening has come at the cost of relative inequality, absolute poverty has certainly decreased with time. Our standard of living has skyrocketed at a rate unprecedented in human history yet avarice clouds our view of reality. This paradox derails us from finding an agreeable concept of \u201ceconomic justice\u201d. When we see such massive variation in wealth around us, it is easy to conflate money with opportunity and privilege instead of hard work and sacrifice. This is capitalism\u2019s most dangerous pitfall - stimulating demand in a market for privilege. When we are so infatuated with the spirit of capitalism that we can no longer discuss what a truly \u201cjust\u201d distribution of wealth is, the market wins. If all we see is injustices committed by the crony, the market still wins.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The Paradox of Inequality"}

I look through it a couple times a day at arguments on both sides to get a better understanding with the ideology I seem most in line with, albeit a little left leaning. \n\nIn a truly free market, it seems to me that a few things may suffer. I'd like to list a few items and get your input to either correct my poor assumptions or to offer suggestions on how it could be handled in a libertarian society. \n\nThe first, and a huge one on my list is the environment. \nSeems to me business isn't very responsible and if people are offered cheap vs sustainable, they usually choose cheap. How do we tackle the protection of the environment, because ultimately, it is the protection of our future. \n\nSecondly, healthcare insurance.\nLiving in the US, uninsured, and in a position in my life where insurance is not desired (not cost effective), I don't put much thought in it for myself. \nHowever, for a vast number of folks, this is a big issue. We know insurance companies make money. And they are really good at it. Seems to me in a free market, healthcare insurance could be abolished and people might come out much better. Providers and drug companies would be forced to be competitive. But what happens when you develop a tumor on your brain. Even in a free market where hospitals compete, it seems to be like that sort of operation could be cost prohibitive. In that case, do we adopt an ideology of understanding that we don't live forever, or is there some way to have free market and some sort of universal healthcare option. If so, who administers it? Our government doesn't do so well at spending other folks money. \n\nDefense is a big one to many folks, especially veterans.\nI feel defense should be just that, defense. Our DoD practices aggression at times and is so thinly spread, if something happened at home, it would take weeks to scramble all our forces back home. I feel a much smaller force is desirable and let more budget go to caring to the vets that have already put in their time and less to inefficient government contractors. \n\nEducation.\nShould there be a public school system at all? Have we outgrown it? If so, how do we replace it in a free market society? \n\nFinally, how do we transition from our current government that employees hundreds of thousands of folks to something perhaps 1/10th or 1/20 smaller? How does one go about reworking our current tools to replace those positions in a free market. \n\nThank you in advance for participation and if there are other topics of interest, I'd like to hear those as well.  \n\nEdit: added healthcare insurance instead of reading healthcare.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Smaller government"}

But the simple truth\u2014born of experience\u2014is that tyranny thrives best where government need not fear the wrath of an armed people. Our own sorry history bears this out: Disarmament was the tool of choice for subjugating both slaves and free blacks in the South. In Florida, patrols searched blacks\u2019 homes for weapons, confiscated those found and punished their owners without judicial process. See Robert J. Cottrol &amp; Raymond T. Diamond, The Second Amendment: Toward an Afro-Americanist Reconsideration, 80 Geo. L.J. 309, 338 (1991). In the North, by contrast, blacks exercised their right to bear arms to defend against racial mob violence. Id. at 341-42. As Chief Justice Taney well appreciated, the institution of slavery required a class of people who lacked the means to resist. See Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 417 (1857) (finding black citizenship unthinkable because it would give blacks the right to \"keep and carry arms wherever they went\"). A revolt by Nat Turner and a few dozen other armed blacks could be put down without much difficulty; one by four million armed blacks would have meant big trouble.\n\n&gt;All too many of the other great tragedies of history\u2014Stalin\u2019s atrocities, the killing fields of Cambodia, the Holocaust, to name but a few\u2014were perpetrated by armed troops against unarmed populations. Many could well have been avoided or mitigated, had the perpetrators known their intended victims were equipped with a rifle and twenty bullets apiece, as the Militia Act required here. See Kleinfeld Dissent at 5997-99.

{"author":"rpanonr","created_utc":1518894627,"num_comments":8,"score":3,"selftext":"Cyclical Consumption\n\nFor instance, our use of a profit-based, \u201cgrowth\u201d-driven monetary system has become one of the greatest destroyers of the natural world and sustainable human values. The entire global economy requires \u201ccyclical consumption\u201d to operate, which means that money must constantly be circulating. Thus, new goods and services must be constantly introduced regardless of the state of the environment and actual human necessity. This \u201cperpetual\u201d approach has a fatal flaw, for resources as we know it are simply not infinite. Resources are finite and the Earth is essentially a closed system. To assume the need for constant consumption to keep people employed and hence the market system going is eco-cidal on a finite planet. The true goal of an economy, by definition, is to strategically preserve and create efficiency. The system today demands the opposite.\n\nInfinite Growth\n\nThe Monetary-Market Model is based upon money being treated as a Commodity and its origination from Debt; sold for Interest Income. This is a \u201cPonzi Scheme\u201d. Each time this Commodity (Money) is sold (Bank Loans), it needs to be paid back (Debt) with more money charged as a fee for profit (Interest). The problem is that the Interest Value required to settle the debt does not exist in the Money Supply outright. In other words, Bankruptcy and Default are not byproducts \u2013 they are inevitable \u2013 as there is always more debt outstanding than money in existence. This creates severe, offset monetary scarcity that oppresses many people on many levels.\n\nThe Value of Scarcity\n\nLikewise, the intents inherent within the monetary system derive a strategic edge from scarcity. This means that depleted resources are actually a positive thing for industry in the short term, for more money can be made off each respective unit. This is contextual to the monetary law of Supply &amp; Demand and hence \u201cValue\u201d in economics. It creates a perverse reinforcement to ignore environmental problems and the negative consequences that create scarcity; not to mention reinforcing technically unnecessary human deprivation. This system does not/can not meet the needs of the many because it isn\u2019t financially efficient to do so.\n\nProblems/Inefficiency = Profit.\n\nSimilarly, the system also requires problems/constant consumer interest in order to work. The more people who have cancer or cars that breakdown, the better the economy due to the servicing of those problems. Needless to say, this also generates an inherent disregard for human well-being and the environment. Sustainability, efficiency, and preservation are the enemies of this model.\n\nCost Efficiency &amp; Irresponsible Obsolescence\n\nThere is also the Cost Efficiency mechanism that demands cutting expenses to remain \u201ccompetitive\u201d in the marketplace. Every single product created by a corporation today is immediately inferior by design, for the market requirement to cut creation costs in favor of lowering the output \u201cpurchase price\u201d to maintain a competitive edge automatically reduces the quality of any given item by default. It is impossible to create the \u201cstrategically best\u201d/long-lasting anything in our society, which translates into outrageous amounts of wasted resources and time. Likewise, this same mechanism is reinforcing the environmental disregard, depletion, and pollution that we see as a constant in the world today\u2026 among other issues.\n\nWaste &amp; Oppression of the Human Resource\n\nAs far as Occupations today, we need to ask ourselves what the point is of a given focus and why it is necessary. The fact is, most jobs today are not directly related to the actual necessities of life. Rather, most are artificial concoctions created in order to keep people employed so they can maintain purchasing power in an environment where our technology continues to expand exponentially, displacing humans from the production force.\n\nIt is a common statement in politics today to hear about \u201ccreating jobs\u201d. Well, in theory, an occupation could be created where people are paid to sit in a room and test chewing gum all day, everyday\u2026 but is that a viable use of the human mind? Should we relegate our mental capacity to simple any so called job due to mere \u201ceconomic\u201d reasons, regardless of what it actually contributes to personal and/or social development? This becomes even more bizarre as a train of reason when we realize that Mechanization not only frees us from labor, but is actually more efficient and productive due to the exponential advancement of science and technology.\n\nOn a different level, the very reality that each human being is required to be put in a position of servitude to a corporation or client in order to gain income to purchase the necessities of life not only perpetuates the waste of the human mind and human life, it is also a form of oppression \u2013 slavery. If we combine the aforementioned \u201cInfinite Growth\u201d point above regarding the Debt pressure that is built into this system, we see that the combination of the guaranteed Debt imbalance and the requirement to submit to Labor, regardless of its purpose/effect, in order to gain monetary income to survival \u2013 is a structural form of oppression against the lower classes (who hold the most debt and need for more periodic income).\n\nAs noted, advancements in science and technology have shown that we can automate a great deal. The more we have applied mechanization to labor, the more productive things have become. Therefore, it is not only negligent for us to waste our lives waiting tables, working at a bus station, fixing cars, or other repetitive, monotonous jobs, it is also entirely irresponsible for us not to apply modern mechanization techniques to all industries where it is possible, for apart from strategic resource management, this is a powerful way to achieve balance and abundance for all the world\u2019s people, thus reducing crime generating imbalances.\n\nThe fact is, the Market System cannot maintain itself with any viable integrity anymore, for corporations will continue to save money through automation, displacing human labor \u2013 which also displaces purchasing power, continuing the inevitable loss of \u201cgrowth\u201d that defines this system.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Can you debunk these critiques of capitalism?"}

We do not restrict the public to public transportation because of the occasional drunk driver causing the car to become illegal to own.\nThis is because, in balance, more people\u2019s lives would be negatively influenced by such bans. There would be wide spread non-compliance with laws that banned the car or the press. If the political target group is small enough, or not articulate, then the attempt to legislate the problem away is viable. It looks as if something is being done, when in reality we all suffer a wrongful precedent that influences our freedoms both in the present, but more importantly changes the course of the law into more restrictive directions.\n\nFirearms are regarded as a throwback to a different age amongst the civilized and well educated socially aware that populate the cities. If you travel to the east coast of America, and experience the crush of humanity, you will be struck by how every square inch of ground has been trod by countless human beings. There is hardly room to breathe, let alone discharge a firearm in a responsible way. There is no use for such a thing in a society that is well regulated. You might as well carry an ice axe, or drive a jeep in Manhattan. As with most people, it is hard to understand or take the time to try understanding something so outside of the experience of yourself and your friends and social class. People tend to judge issues by their experience in a very specific environment. The day to day life of the city dwelling citizen would rarely include tools overtly deadly in nature. Sporting use, in the case of firearms, is not a good enough reason, again in balance, to outweigh the potential to easily end a human life. Many things can end human life in our environment, but none so easily as the pulling of the trigger of an easily acquired firearm. Yet, outside the cities and very crowded spaces of the east coast \u2013 you have a different situation. Firearms are considered a tool for application to specific problems, not deadly nuisances. Besides the specific needs of predator control by ranchers and farmers, the security needs of the remote and far from help rural dwellers, the hunter who culls the wild animal species with the support of the state, history and tradition, in short \u2013 the many faceted and diverse environments outside of the urban dwellers world: There is the need to be able to resist a wrongfully minded majority or tyrannical government. For much of history, the common person has not had an effective way to fight an authority gone wrong. In the final analysis, this human right has been wrested from the powers that be at great cost. It would eventually be the death of us too lose it. \n\nSo \u2013 what do we do?   We have a problem with a very small minority of what are clearly non-worthy individuals who abuse a fundamental human right. The law cannot parse the situation, to sanction those individuals in the minority, without infringement of the rights of all others who are righteous in exercising their freedoms.\n\nWe live in changing times, some say for the worse. It is undeniable though, that our fundamental social milieu is changing, as well as our technical environment. It is to the latter that we find our solution. The cell phone killed the phone booth. The internet is killing the mall and large retail chains. Technology can subdue and nullify the mass killing shooter. The following solution depends on the reader considering the potential moving forward, not every objection that comes to mind. Any issue that you can foresee can be overcome with the application of human creativity. It will require time and patience \u2013 but the upside is to preserve our freedoms for the majority \u2013 and selectively suppress the offender.\n\nThis is a multi-part proposal:\n\nThe firearm community should impose a tax on itself to fund this solution. This tax would be on the sale of firearms and ammunition, an added value tax on transfers done in private sales, reloading equipment and components, in short \u2013 all aspects of the industry and culture. This is already occurring for this community for another reason; hunters and anglers did this many years ago to fund programs that support habitat protection and other programs and regulations run by the state. The thinking was that those who benefit should pay for those programs, rather than everyone regardless of interest or inclination. Those who never fish or hunt should not have to pay for those who do.\n\nA prize should be offered for the best application of technology for the specific situation of stopping a mass shooter (primarily), and violent social behavior (secondary). There were prizes awarded for the first man to cross the English Channel in an airplane, one was offered for the first trans-Atlantic flight, in fact it used to be the method of choice to stimulate growth in technology. Many different perspectives come up with varieties of invention. Government solutions tend to be fraught with committee think and mediocrity.\n \nOnce a system is chosen- then the Department of Homeland Security would see that it was installed in all public areas that might be targets of terror groups or lone wolf individual offenders. This technology would only respond to violent behavior, and would be non-lethal. As everyone benefits from the near instantaneous response times of a system being deployed in these spaces, I do propose that the maintenance and development over time be publicly supported with tax dollars.\n\nComponents of such a system would be run by artificial intelligence. Programing would include non-lethal responses to the display of firearms. System responses might include Taser, tangle foot, and paintball technology designed to stun, immobilize, or tranquilize targets. The system might be cellular in application, having a station every so often at certain distances apart, or fast moving components such as mini drones armed with non-lethal components.  \n\nThere is technology that currently exists to make up much of this sort of system. Self-driving cars are currently being developed. Drone tech exists. Artificial intelligence can be tasked to measure and manipulate in three dimensions for manufacturing. Facial recognition is being developed. The recognition of a firearm in three dimensional space can be a development based on existing technology.\n\nThe state of the art at present is on the cusp of making this idea a reality. There will be failures at first, but eventually, it will be worked out. We are currently at the possible first stage like Windows 3.1 and 486 computers \u2013 but are there any doubts that this is not possible? With non-lethal suppression of violence, that specifically targets the offender- what\u2019s not to like? Although a citizen could still be armed with the proper concealed weapons permit, what would be the purpose? That job would be done by the system \u2013 if the system is sophisticated enough.\n\nI know that there are a number- almost countless- problems with this idea. None are unsolvable. It would be a system under development for many years.  But eventually it would solve a number of social issues, without discrimination, and would preserve the rights of our citizens to go about their business without the law affecting the human rights of the citizen regarding the right to self-preservation. In any case, banishment of firearms does not have to be the only solution. There are other ways to look at the issue that should be encouraged.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"No need for gun confiscation"}

Government solutions tend to be fraught with committee think and mediocrity.\n \nOnce a system is chosen- then the Department of Homeland Security would see that it was installed in all public areas that might be targets of terror groups or lone wolf individual offenders. This technology would only respond to violent behavior, and would be non-lethal. As everyone benefits from the near instantaneous response times of a system being deployed in these spaces, I do propose that the maintenance and development over time be publicly supported with tax dollars.\n\nComponents of such a system would be run by artificial intelligence. Programing would include non-lethal responses to the display of firearms. System responses might include Taser, tangle foot, and paintball technology designed to stun, immobilize, or tranquilize targets. The system might be cellular in application, having a station every so often at certain distances apart, or fast moving components such as mini drones armed with non-lethal components.  \n\nThere is technology that currently exists to make up much of this sort of system. Self-driving cars are currently being developed. Drone tech exists. Artificial intelligence can be tasked to measure and manipulate in three dimensions for manufacturing. Facial recognition is being developed. The recognition of a firearm in three dimensional space can be a development based on existing technology.\n\nThe state of the art at present is on the cusp of making this idea a reality. There will be failures at first, but eventually, it will be worked out. We are currently at the possible first stage like Windows 3.1 and 486 computers \u2013 but are there any doubts that this is not possible? With non-lethal suppression of violence, that specifically targets the offender- what\u2019s not to like? Although a citizen could still be armed with the proper concealed weapons permit, what would be the purpose? That job would be done by the system \u2013 if the system is sophisticated enough.\n\nI know that there are a number- almost countless- problems with this idea. None are unsolvable. It would be a system under development for many years.  But eventually it would solve a number of social issues, without discrimination, and would preserve the rights of our citizens to go about their business without the law affecting the human rights of the citizen regarding the right to self-preservation. In any case, banishment of firearms does not have to be the only solution. There are other ways to look at the issue that should be encouraged.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"No need for gun confiscation""num_comments":3,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"CCW","title":"No need for gun confiscation"}

{"author":"nathanb131","created_utc":1518989293,"num_comments":50,"score":0,"selftext":"I'm a lifelong Libertarian and I think we should outlaw semi-automatic rifles.\n\nTLDR: No one NEEDS to fire 45 rounds per minute and 'gun culture' can fuck right off.\n\nLibertarianism is about preventing fellow humans from being able to leverage too much power. That's the primary concern about big government which is a concentration of power.  We support a national military to preserve our country's sovereignty.  We support the existence of a robust legal system so there is recourse when individual rights are violated and contracts are broken.  We support a local police force to protect our personal rights to peace and autonomy from theft and violence.\n\nAt our core, we are against the threat or act of violence against peaceful citizens.  We believe all individuals should be able to peacefully engage with society in a voluntary way.  Live and let live.  My freedom to swing my arms ends where your nose begins.  \n\nEven most hardcore libertarians and right-wingers are already in agreement that individuals shouldn't have access to weapons of mass murder.  That you can't own a tank and you can't have VX gas isn't declared a violation of individual freedom.  We've already drawn the line that some weapons are just too powerful to allow one citizen to wield.   So really, the debate is where to strike the balance between the right to bear arms and the right to live in a peaceful society with a state-imposed limit on what one deranged maniac can accomplish on a whim.\n\n\n-------------Unanimously banned for individual ownership--------------\n\n1. Nuclear weapons \n\t\n2. Chemical weapons\n\t\n3. Biological weapons\n\t\n4. Military combat weapons (grenades, rocket launchers, Howitzers, mortars)\n\t\n5. Military assault vehicles (tanks, Bradlys, Jeeps with mounted machine guns)\n\t\n6. Fully automatic firearms (M16, Uzi, Ak47)\n\n\n----------------Weapons legally allowed----------------------\n\n\n'7. Semi-automatic rifles \n\n'8. Chuck Norris\n\t\n'9. Semi-automatic handguns\n\t\n'10. Bolt-action rifles, shotguns\n\t\n'11. Stun guns\n\t\n\t\nWe should move the line down one more. 45 shots per minute is too much power for one individual. 10 shots per minute rate of bolt action rifles is good enough for hunting, home defense, and 'sport'.  \n\nI realize that many libertarians here will call me a hypocrite and an idiot and point out how flawed my logic is.  I can't blame you and philosophically you are right and I am wrong.  This a pragmatic point I'm making.   I want to explore the idea that being for gun regulations can be compatible with libertarianism.  My reasoning on the usual points:\n\n\nA: \"We have a right to create a militia to defend ourselves against tyranny.\"    \n\nThat ship has sailed.  The 'state' has weapon categories 1-6 and a total monopoly on military force.  If they want our life and land, they can take it.  I'm not saying that is an ok situation, but it's a separate topic than selling AR15s.  I don't want to allow crazy Billy in mom's basement 45 shots per minute because we still fantasize about 'holding off the feds' when the shit hits the fan.  OF COURSE the police are too militarized and aggressive and we have to work on correcting that, but it's a separate issue that having our own arsenal does nothing to solve or even mitigate.  \n\nB: \"Criminals don't follow laws. Passing a new law will only hurt law abiding citizens\"\n\nSupply matters.  I said I was a lifelong Libertarian and this is one of our core arguments against statists.  You. Are. Right.  Obviously.  Every murderer breaks existing laws and doesn't give a shit about new rules.  OF COURSE banning semi-autos won't magically keep criminals from getting them through the black market.  However, refer to the list and think of the supply.  How many criminals are getting their hands on atomic bombs and VX nerve gas?  Zero. OF COURSE There is a black market for machine guns and fuck the military-industrial-complex for supplying them.  But there is a MUCH lower supply of machine guns in circulation than AR15s.  Supply matters. Chicago and St Louis gang bangers aren't using grenades and Uzis not because they are impossible to get, but because handguns are FAR easier to get.  This little shit in Florida could have probably found an Uzi on the black market via the dark web and bitcoin.  OF COURSE evil will always find a way, but evil tends to be lazy and impulsive.  Instead of choosing the best black market solution, the piece of shit in Florida lazily settled for the most effective death tool readily available down the street.  Supply matters.\n\nC: \"We are 350 million people, the real risk of mass shootings is statistically zero.  So banning something that 99.9% of the time isn't used for murder is just playing into the hands of the statists/russians/lesbians/illuminati/immigrants/matt damon/kuks/pussyhats etc.\" \n\nOf course our worrying about mass shootings is way out of proportion to the risk. Though the cost is way more than just the few unlucky victims.  Every single school in the country now has to 'prepare' for this and every single student is now participating in shooting drills just like fire drills and just like they all did with nuclear war drills.  That's a HUGE cost administratively (at taxpayer expense) and it's an even higher mental health cost.  The Right's general answer right now is to supply armed guards and armed teachers.  Most these tragedies HAD a guard on campus at the time!  Should we make it 10 guards and a roof sniper?  Fuck you, I'm not paying those salaries from my tax dollars just because you want the 'freedom' of 45 shots per minute to blow off steam. That's a neocon solution, not a libertarian one.  Oh you want to arm teachers so the extra cost is nil?  Did you go to high school?  How many times did you personally witness the weird kid flipping out in a classroom?  Imagine every 'weird kid' is now fully aware that every teacher has a gun in the desk or a holster?  Sounds like a perfect way to add a hundred double murders per year in an attempt to cut the mass shooting body counts in half.\n\nD. \"Won't eliminate attacks, they'll just used handguns, trucks, pipe bombs, trebuchets, ninja stars etc\"\n\nNo shit.  Evil finds a way.  Can we at least limit Evil to pausing between shots and having to stop and re-load after 6 shots?  That's an absolutist argument that disregards the grey lines we've already drawn.  This Florida fucker had smoke grenades.  If real grenades were a legal hobby in this country like AR15's, the body counts would be in the hundreds.  There is NO WAY to stop insane violence but we can limit the effectiveness of  the most effective murder tools legal available.\n\nE. \"I have a right to defend my life, family, and property from criminals who aren't following the same gun rules\"\n\nThis is a really strange argument to make if you are going to appeal to statistics for the other arguments.  The odds of any citizen to find themselves in that situation is infinitesimal.  For those rare encounters that DO occur, the odds of the outcome being different because of a low rate of fire is a tiny subset of an already rare event.  Your aim in the vast majority of self-defense scenarios is to stop ONE human.  A mass killer's aim is every human in sight.  45 rounds per minute is a gigantic boost to the lunatic's effectiveness and a very small boost to self-defense.  The pro/con of legit use vs criminal goals is WAY is disproportionately in favor of the bad guys.  If you are REALLY concerned that a shotgun just isn't tactical enough to repel intruders, then I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree where the 'line' is.  \n\n\nF: \"I need it for hunting varmints!\"\n\nHad to put this straw-man in there.  No self-respecting hunter would admit they need 45 rounds per minute to kill furry woodland creatures.  \n\n\nG: \"Fuck you I enjoy playing GI Joe target-practice as a hobby and I'm not hurting anyone.  Come and take them!\"\n\nYou are really appealing to \"it's fun and cool\" to justify the 'sport' of target shooting with something designed to kill multiple living things with ease?  Buy more inexplicably camouflaged items, lift your truck a few more inches, lift weights, play poker, adopt a pit bull, blast Rob Zombie, insult my mom on COD, get viagra, remove all the mufflers in your life, wear MMA shirts, get sleeve tats.  If you have a need to look and feel like a bad-ass then there are better ways to fill that hole in your sensitive ego.  There is a gigantic masculinity problem these days and men everywhere are struggling on how to act without losing their self-esteem.  Schools in particular are enforcing behavior and standards that are a better fit for women and that is a huge problem.  Men are confused and rebelling and you can't blame them.  But there's a perfectly good middle ground between being a spineless 'soy boy' and 'intimidating tough guy'.   John Wayne didn't need a lift kit and a machine gun bumper sticker to remind bystanders of his manliness.   I'm tired of taking the side of these insecure 'bad asses' Rambo-wannabes in this gun debate.  The only people you are impressing with your macho bullshit are other insecure men and shallow women.  The rest of us feel sorry for you.  Nor do I intend to join the ranks of the sniveling virtue-signaling constant whiners of the left.  Both these groups of pathetic man-children can get a grip and stop infringing on my kids' right to peace and liberty.  \n\n\"What a cuck!  There's no difference between a hunting rifle and AR15!\"   Yes, so why are you buying the 'tactical' looking one and the matching tattoo?  The argument that they are identical in function says just as much about you owning one as it does about ignorant liberal activists.  Why is demand for the cool black one through the roof?  To pretend that the 'tough guy' image of a black rifle with a handle on top vs a brown hunting rifle isn't part of the appeal to Crazy Billy is being willfully obtuse.\n\nH: \"LOL, he called this thing on of those things and thinks this thing does that so he knows NOTHING about guns and should shut the hell up.\"\n\nNobody likes pedants and everyone hates you at parties but smiles as they suffer through your lectures on your niche interests. And nobody says 'ought' in place of a zero unless they are British or trying to sound badass talking about gunz. I'm aware that '45 rounds per minute' is a gross generalization and that you can fire an AR15 about twice a second but that doesn't mean you can fire 120 rounds per minute because of clip sizes and jams due to overheating.  I grew up on a farm, and have done plenty of hunting with semi-auto rifles.  My dad was a cop and his sidearms and other weapons were a constant presence in our house.  I'm not coming at this from an ignorant 'all guns are scary and bad' experience.  Though I haven't had firearms in my life for a long while and am obviously biased against 'badass gun culture'.  \n\n\n I: \"It's a mental health issue!\"\n\nOf course it is. That's even MORE reason to prevent access to mass murder tools. We have to address mental health.  This isn't an either/or thing.  \n\n\nThis was almost painful to write, as I can't stand the logic and motivation behind most anti-gun zealots either.  We can find a better balance though and it wouldn't mean we are 'giving up our right to bear arms'.  Is there a SINGLE libertarian here who's with me on this?  \n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"This Libertarian is FOR gun control. Get the popcorn."}

Thats all well and good but there is a rather large constituency of Libertarians who seem to somehow feel as though the American public is somehow excessively indulging in higher education. An extremely common analogy being the standing up at a concert to get a better view and everyone deciding to do so cancelling out the original/early benefits enjoyed by a savvy few.\n\nMy issues with this line of thinking are numerous but ill try to be brief and non combatitive. I think these figures totally ignore the aspect of international competition in respect to education (if Americans stop accelerating their educational pursuits and expanding higher education to greater numbers of people, they will be bypassed by other economies who prioritize it more in the vital information-technology sectors). Effectively it would leave America on aggregate \"sitting down\" while other countries stand up. Aside from ignoring the obvious positive effects greater access to higher education has on economic mobility.\n\nThe other more insidious argument revolves around degrees that apparently lack practical future economic use (as of that were the only valuable purpose of education) while ignoring the obvious implocations more highly educated populations have on the quality of elected officials aside from general economic productivity. Along with the tone deaf arguments about the tendency of education to create a large debt burden while knowing full well tgis isnt a problem in countries that ensure cheap access to education, or even the US before mass cut backs to state schools.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"A brief rant about anti higher education Libertarians"}

And much poison at the end for a pleasant death. \n\nOne still works, for work is a pastime. But one is careful lest the pastime should hurt one. \n\nOne no longer becomes poor or rich; both are too burdensome. Who still wants to rule? Who still wants to obey?

Nobody wants the headache of having to ensure their own well-being. They have decided to be dependents, eagerly turning themselves over to the hands of a parental government who will take care of any potential problems for them. That\u2019s the worry-free lifestyle. \n\nHaving decided to be defenseless, these last men naturally want everyone else to be likewise defenseless. If you are the kind of person who doesn\u2019t want to pull out his own teeth, who thinks there is more to life than the absence of discomfort, then you present a threat to the lifestyle of the last men. And since their worldview is all about withdrawing from the struggle of a fulfilling life, achieving nothing while suffering nothing, even the remotest threat of discomfort must be crushed by the nanny state.

{"author":"Charlemagne42","created_utc":1519060676,"num_comments":47,"score":15,"selftext":"One of the most frequent arguments I've heard from people who support increasing the minimum wage is that it's \"too little to survive on\". They further argue that a large swath of Americans are living on the federal minimum wage or less, and that workers are trapped in minimum wage jobs for their entire careers. I'm going to address the latter arguments in this post, but I'd really like to see more insight on everything in the comments.\n\nFirst, some statistics from the US [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/bls/blsmissn.htm), a federal agency charged with \"collect[ing], analyz[ing], and disseminat[ing] essential economic information to support public and private decision\u2013making.\" [The latest report on minimum wage statistics](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2016/home.htm) was published in April 2017 on data from 2016. I'll pull out some highlights:\n\n- 58.7% (79.9 million) of paid workers were paid hourly.\n\n- 2.2 million workers were compensated at or below the minimum wage level. (This statistic includes unpaid workers.)\n\n- Statistics on the minimum wage do not include other forms of income considered by federal law to supplement hourly wages, including tips, commissions, and overtime pay.\n\n- Workers 25 and under represent ~20% of paid workers, and ~50% of workers paid at or below the minimum wage (including unpaid workers).\n\n- At-or-below workers are relatively diverse: to the nearest whole percent; 3% of women, 2% of men, 3% of whites, 3% of blacks, 2% of Hispanics, 2% of Asians.\n\n- Education controls income: 5% of non-HS graduates, 3% of HS grads, and 2% of college grads work at-or-below.\n\n- Family status correlates with income: 5% of unmarried and 1% of married workers earn at-or-below.\n\n- Industry controls income: 60% (!) of at-or-below workers were employed in the leisure and hospitality industry, specifically at restaurants, specifically working as wait staff or other tipped positions.\n\n- States with higher minimum wages than the federal minimum wage tend to have fewer at-or-below workers.\n\nNow I'll break some of this down. Let's assume that all the unpaid workers in the second statistic were actually counted among the paid workers in the first statistic (they weren't). Then of all workers in America, paid and unpaid, 58.7% \\* (2.2 / 79.9) = 1.62% are paid at-or-below. 1.62% is hardly a significant fraction of America. You're more likely to be *unemployed* than underpaid. And half of those are under 25. Being \"trapped\" in a minimum wage job for your entire career only happens to, at most, 0.81% of people in America; assuming every over-25 at-or-below is on the brink of retirement.\n\nTips are [a little harder to track](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/02/how-much-do-waiters-really-earn-in-tips/385515/) (2015), but data universally shows that nearly all of the 60% of at-or-below workers who are waitstaff earn more in *tips alone* than the minimum wage. Without data on how much of the waitstaff is under-25, for the sake of argument I'll say all the under-25s are waitstaff. This leaves 40% of the original number as \"trapped\" in at-or-below jobs with no opportunity for tips for their entire career, or only 0.648% of Americans.\n\nEven if you assume that every one of those Americans struggled through raising a family on a single minimum-wage job, that still doesn't account for the federal assistance programs designed for exactly this tiny minority of people. Raising the federal minimum wage will not eliminate child hunger, it will not miraculously bestow dignity upon the indignant, and it will certainly not save tens of millions of lives. To those who are so concerned about wages causing poverty and poverty causing death, I urge you to [get involved](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&amp;cgid=7&amp;cuid=20) in one of [many international organizations](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&amp;cgid=7&amp;cuid=19) devoted to [improving the standard of living](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.results&amp;cgid=7&amp;cuid=30) in the areas of the world where people suffer most profoundly.\n\nBecause individual choices mean so much more than the unfeeling motions of uncaring government.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Let's talk about the minimum wage."}

The girl with the shaved head needs to chill.  Gross emotion may help to sway your own side but it makes you look like a lunatic in the eyes of your political opposition. \n\n2.) People have the right to life, yes, but that right is one of several.  You can't selectively choose which 'right' to emphasize over others.  In America we recognize that people have the right to Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness...  and the ability to own firearms is a part of that.\n\n3.) Other countries with strict gun laws also suffer public violence.  In China they had some guy walk into a school and start stabbing people with a knife.  He managed to kill or wound 22 people.  Guns are merely a means to an end, ban them and people will use other means. \n\n4.) I'm going to be straight with you, I couldn't care less what all the teenagers across the country think.  The youth are among the most vocal of armchair activists, but per age group they are the least likely to vote.  I doubt any of those protestors will bother to get up early in the morning to go vote in order to enforce their activism. \n\n5.) Let's not play mental gymnastics: you are indeed trying to take guns out of people's hands.  There's a moment in the interview where the one young man in front says that they aren't trying to take people's rights away, but then immediately stumbles as the mental realization of his position dawns on him.  \n\n6.) David Hogg isn't helping by singling out President Trump.  He looks less like a survivor-turned-activist and more like a political shill when he does that kind of stuff on air.  Also, for much of this interview he sounded like he was reciting from a rehearsed script? \n\n7.) The problem with school shootings is both mental health and an issue of culture.  School shooters tend to be mentally unhinged individuals or loners who are seeking to get back at people.  The issue here is not guns but singling out ways to deal with such people.

More and more women are reporting to the police that are being abused by their husbands or boyfriends, so when that happens, the man has no rights to defend for himself (only his/her lawyer can defend him, the accused cannot say a word) and is put in \"preventive\" prison until the trial takes places, which could take years in some cases. This is happening a lot lately and many lawyers and others make a living from this. Because of this, I cannot contemplate to start a healthy relationship with a woman nor have kids without being worried about being falsely accused of domestic violence. What years ago was simply a \"couple's argument\", nowadays is seen as \"psychologic violence against women\". It is getting worse and worse, kids are being indoctrinated in schools and that law that I refer to, is getting revised to \"improve it\".\nI feel like living in 1984, I refuse to live under these conditions and I want to move to another country where men have rights and do not go to jail when a crazy or selfish woman decide to report him to the police just for revenge, to get the kids custody, to get husband assets or all of them.\n\nAny ideas of countries where the feminist totalitarian dictatorship is not present?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Feminist dictatorship in Spain.

No one put in labor the create the earth. Without access to land, you cant provide for yourself nor occupy space, how can one claim a free society if we cant even provide food and shelter for ourselves.If you occupying the space that ''belongs'' to somelese, then his can make any rule, it is his property, no? In my land i could disarm all tenants, or enforce any rule i want, its MY land, no? It comes down to two types of land claim systems. Usage vs nonusage. And one must recognize that charging rent for land you dont use is really just being a parasite. your not providing anything to society the so called ''goal'' of capitalism. you just being a parasite becuase the state created a land monopoly. this issue is really reallt important to me and to liberty. I want to wake up as many ''ancaps'' as posible. Aditionally Ancaps will create private states with their proposals of private law, judges, police, prisons! Aditionally Land usage claim system would maximize or increase economic activity, instead of the current system of land speculation. In which empty plots of land cant be used for entrepreuership, but are not used by anyone indefinitely. Its really quite simple. I think a valid question that land owners make is ''well then i can just build a house and i leave for a trip and someone takes it.'' Both claiming systems (property and possession) require common sense and INTELLIGENCE to determine boundaries, usage, etc. Im confident in my ability to determine thats sensible as the land boundaries and usage, and id prefer that then the current system, just like id prefer anarchy to statism. Its like access to rivers and water, as long as your usage doesnt affect others then negatively use it! same with oxygen molecules or anything. If you hoard all the water or oxygen molecules and then sell it, yeah you can technically do it, that doesnt mean its moral. As a final important point to ''ancaps'' who love to mention the homesteading principle of john locke, they purposely ignore his own words, the lockean provisso (from wikipedia): ''Locke held that individuals have a right to homestead private property from nature by working on it, but that they can do so only \"...at least where there is enough, and as good, left in common for others\".The proviso maintains that appropriation of unowned resources is a diminution of the rights of others to it, and would be acceptable only so long as it does not make anyone worse off than they would have been before''\n\nThis is an extremely important and underrated issue. As an investor myself, i am very hestitant to hoard land becuase i truly believe it is inmoral even though the profit motive is huge. Its not just about money, my land, my rules, others land, others rules, I never want to be in a position nor put others of a position where i can tell them the rules of their own dwellings.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Permanent Land ownership vs Land possession/usage - Please read + The Lockean proviso is ignored by anarchocapitalists."}

It is the creation of an individual running for State Representative. \n\n&gt;Healthcare Cost Caps is a plan I came up with when I was trying to find a compromise between the Democrats wanting a single-payer system and Republicans wanting a complete free market. The plan places caps on how much a healthcare facility can charge for procedures. Currently, hospitals charge 5-10 times what a procedure actually costs, and not all hospitals charge the same amount. One hospital may charge $10,000 for a procedure while another hospital down the road may charge $100,000 for the same exact procedure. I will introduce a bill that will put a board together to find the fair market value or average cost of all procedures, and place caps that a facility can not charge over. The bill will also require price transparency of all procedures offered, readily available and easy to find at their facility or on their website. This plan should artificially lower insurance costs, still allow a free market within the caps, and allow individuals to find the best pricing when needing a non-emergency procedure.\n\nAlso:\n\n&gt;The cost of healthcare cannot be controlled by the free market:\n&gt;\n&gt;When in an emergency, you can\u2019t determine what the cheapest hospital is.\n&gt;\n&gt;Hospitals charge ridiculously inflated prices for materials and services (Chargemaster)\n&gt;\n&gt;Insurance companies get massive discounts on these ridiculously inflated prices\n&gt;\n&gt;When going to a hospital or clinic, if you have insurance, no one price shops. Why price shop when you know all you\u2019ll have to pay when you get there is a $20 co-pay? Even if you tried, almost 0 hospitals and clinics have their pricing readily available.\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Can I get a Libertarian perspective on a Healthcare Cost Cap plan I read about?"}

I do think the NRA is dishonest, and intentionally and deliberately sought to misinform and distract the American public from the gun debate to the determinate of mentally ill Americans.**\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt; Whenever our country is shaken by a mass shooting, cowardly politicians do two things without fail. First, they send out canned \u201cthoughts and prayers.\u201d And then, they talk about fixing a \u201cbroken mental health care system\u201d without actually doing anything about it.\n\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt; This bait-and-switch tactic allows politicians to avoid discussion of America\u2019s lax gun laws or the role such laws play in our gun violence epidemic. It\u2019s convenient. They can advocate improved mental health care as a solution to gun violence rather than advancing commonsense gun violence prevention policies that would actually reduce such violence. **The fixation on mental health care is disingenuous, stigmatizing, and not based on evidence.**\n\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt; The link \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 between mental illness and violence, simply doesn't hold water. Research shows that mental illness alone plays a relatively minor role in interpersonal violence. Suggesting otherwise **further stigmatizes those who live with mental illness, the vast majority of whom will never be violent.**\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt; While mental illness is not a significant risk factor for violence against others, mental illness does increase the risk of suicide. About **90 percent of those who die from suicide experienced symptoms of mental illness prior to their death,** and these individuals are often undiagnosed, misdiagnosed, untreated, or undertreated. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt; **Politicians and talking heads only feign concern about mental illness when they are trying to deflect attention from efforts to pass desperately needed gun violence prevention legislation.**\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; The NRA has no desire to prevent suicides if doing so means removing firearms from individuals in danger. And the GOP has no desire to stand up to the NRA.\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\n&gt; **NRA leaders love to perpetuate stigma by blaming mental illness for firearm homicides despite data showing mental illness is not a significant risk factor for interpersonal violence.** They benefit from painting people with mental illness as violent \u201cmonsters.\u201d They tell their followers to take up arms against the \u201cderanged.\u201d They vilify and use these individuals to distract us from the real cause of gun violence: lax gun laws.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&gt; While improved mental health care would undoubtedly result in fewer firearm suicides, research shows that if mental health care were to improve, our gun homicide epidemic would likely remain constant. And then, the NRA would no longer have their go-to scapegoat. By weakening mental health care, the NRA and their puppets can continue to lament the broken mental health care system when gun violence occurs. They are hoping we will forget they chose to weaken it.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSource ~ r/badpill","subreddit":"Badpill","title":"Mental Health Screening for Public Schools? - Not if you want a Public Health Catastrophe - Public Health Catastrophe""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"[deleted]","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Mental Health Screening for Public Schools? - Not if you want a Public Health Catastrophe!"}

Now I'm from the UK where the only legal firearms are certain hunting rifles and double barrelled shotguns. I personally agree with the right to bear arms but that doesn't excuse the fact mass shootings keep happening (although yes overall gun crime is decreasing). The problem I have with any argument I see from the libertarian/Conservative side (e.g Ben Shapiro, Steven Crowder) is that they don't offer an alternative solution to banning guns. Forgive me if I'm just ignorant but it really irritates me because the anti-gun camp really don't listen to the argument of the second amendment and arming schools, so I feel there has to another non-aggresive solution that can happen quickly.

{"author":"NeitherFeeling","created_utc":1519267444,"num_comments":6,"score":1,"selftext":"&gt;25.7% of respondents speak a language other than English. Within this sample, 41.5% claim to speak the other language \"very well.\" Within this sub-sub-sample, just 7.0% say they learned to speak this foreign language in school. If you multiply out these three percentages, you get 0.7%. The marginal product of two years of pain and suffering per high school graduate: less than one student in a hundred acquires fluency. (And that's self-assessed fluency, which people almost surely exaggerate).\n\nGiven that this is self-reported and \"very well\" leaves a lot of room for interpretation, and the survey does not differentiate between public and private school, I wouldn't be surprised if the number was closer to 0.1% than 0.7%.\n\nhttp://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/08/the_marginal_pr.html\n\nA year of high school costs $6,000 in Utah and $18,000 in New York.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/06/21/155515613/how-much-does-the-government-spend-to-send-a-kid-to-school\n\nIf the average student takes 6 classes, I think it's reasonable to assign foreign language 10% of the total cost.\n\nLastly, I think a conservative would guess be that the average public school student in the US will take two years of foreign language classes.\n\n(($10,000 / 10) * 2) / 0.007 = $286,000\n\nNow lets use a less conservative estimate. Where...\n\nA year of schooling costs $15,000, the average student takes 4 years of foreign language classes, and only 0.1% attain a high level of proficiency.\n\n(($15,000 / 10) * 4) / 0.001 = $6,000,000\n\nNow lastly, to get an idea of the total cost, lets add the opportunity cost of the students' time which we will value at $3.00 an hour.\n\n(180 Days x 4 Years x 1 Hour x $3.00 + (($15,000 / 10) * 4)) / 0.001 = $8,160,000\n\nKeep in mind, this does not include spending at the university level.\n\nSo when people say public education is an investment in our future, ask them if they think spending seven figures to teach their kid french would be a wise investment.\n\nLastly, my experience as someone who enjoys language learning, is that the methods used in school are typically so tedious and ineffective that it often has the net effect of turning people off from language learning altogether.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"It costs seven figures for the government to teach a kid french."}

{"author":"WordOfRabbit","created_utc":1519267716,"num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"So this is an odd duckling of a post, but I made a comment in /r/RealTesla, responding to another commenter that believed we should use taxes to influence and direct society. What I meant to write was a short and direct response, but instead it turned into more-or-less a stream of consciousness on the foundation of what Libertarianism means to me.\n\nSometimes I feel like my thoughts on government and market forces can differ greatly from others in here, so I want to post that comment, and get others thoughts, beyond its original subreddit (which unfortunately has the strong possibility of responses like \"your a crazy right-wing...\").\n\n&gt;I believe in the guiding hand of the market. The government is there to serve the people (as in, provide services), not tell the people what to do. Taxes exist so that the government has the operating capital it needs to provide these services. If a society doesn't want something, nobody should be trying to influence them one way or another. Society as a whole will decide where it wants to go (for good or for bad), in how it spends its money.\n\n&gt;I'm certainly not making this next claim about you, instead just stating an observation I've made.\n\n&gt;It seems that too many people nowadays have forgotten how a capitalist society fundamentally functions. It's almost as if people have this mistaken assumption that companies, especially big companies, just have money that comes from thin air. Some of them certainly get government hand-outs, and that needs to stop, but companies need to get their money from somewhere, and that somewhere is primarily from consumers. If consumers want to buy, or are made to buy your product, you make money. If they don't want what you're selling, they lose money. It seems simple, but then you get people lamenting fast food for being so prevalent, completely misunderstanding that they're so prevalent, because people want it and buy it.\n\n&gt;Sorry for that semi-tangent. Getting back on track; you're trying to give me tax examples of things you think I would agree do some good. Yes, I agree groceries should be more affordable by reducing or removing taxes on them; yes I agree that low income households shouldn't be as burdened by taxes. The issue is, you think that because I would agree with the premise, that I would agree \"guiding\" taxes are the way to go about it.\n\n&gt;The reality is, all those exemptions and differing tax rates are band-aids on a failed system. The correct way to solve these issues isn't to create more edge cases and special tax rates, it's to gut and revamp the tax system so that it more fairly taxes the people as a whole. Remember, taxes are meant as a revenue system for the government, so it has the capital it needs to operate the services a government provides. Those taxes aren't there to \"direct\" the people, or to levy punishments or incentives or any other number of things the tax system has been abused for.\n\n&gt;A government *governs* so that it can operate services, the most important of which is a judicial system, that primary purpose isn't to jail or \"lay justice\" on people. Its primary purpose is to instill security in the market, so that everyone can do business, knowing that their deals and contracts have the fair legal backing of the courts. Instead, this is just another thing that has been tortured and abused until corrupted, so now we're left with a judicial system that favors some over others. Unfortunately this favor tends to fall with those with the most money.\n\n&gt;Make no mistake; the entire world, not just the US, is treading treacherous waters. We've been out here so long we've lost sight of land, and are beginning to question which direction it's in. There's now arguments, turning into fights, over how we should ration the supplies. Some argue the weakest should get the most as they need them more; others argue the officers should have the most, as they're our only chance to get back to shore. Then there are those of us that argue that maybe we should just ration them equally and allow individuals to decide if they want to give up a portion of their ration to others of their choosing. But it seems that no matter how many people are on any given side, no matter if we've all managed to come to some conclusion, albeit temporary, the officers just take everything and distribute it how they please anyhow.\n\nFor those interested, here's the original [comment chain](https://np.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/7yxx17/tesla_model_s_outsells_german_luxury_flagships_in/dul4sj9/).","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"My little Libertarian stream of consciousness; please critique and/or add to my thoughts on market forces and place of the government."}

I've been subscribed to this sub for some time.\n\nIn the US, observe that anytime a group of white nationalists gathers under a Swastika flag the media sounds the alarm bells.  Neo-nazis are immediately demonized and denounced by no shortage of voices.  The acknowledgement that the ideology behind that symbol is violent and dangerous to society typically goes without saying. It has earned its reputation as hateful and unviable to a prosperous society.  But why not the Sickle as well? Conservatives have no problem denouncing neo-nazis.  Even though that should go without saying, they do it as a reminder that while neo Nazis are technically right wing, they are not accepted by the rest of the right wing. \n\nThe left does not make this distinction with the radical left. When radical leftists display the Hammer and Sickle it goes without condemnation from rest of the left.  It's as if the Hammer and Sickle has no association with the atrocities of the Soviet Union anymore.  \n\nI disagree with a lot of what conservatives have to say, as many on this sub do.

Some might argue \u2014 but what about kids who don't know basic verbal and math skills and who don't know how to learn? Well, then why aren't schools concentrating almost exclusively on teaching them that? Do we really need to put kids through 12 years of education in order to teach them reading, writing, basic math, and the joy of learning? No, that is absurd. Surely there are better ways to help kids who haven't managed to learn basic reading, writing, and math skills by school age than with a generic 12-year curriculum most of which is devoted to teaching specific fields of knowledge.\n\nSo what are schools for?

I\u2019ve seen a consistent stream of anti-socialist/communist posts here, and even based of a brief search for the word socialism in the sub, all the posts appear negative.  Libertarianism is a political philosophy that stresses the importance of \u201cLiberty\u201d which can be understood as personal freedom and is the polar opposite of authoritarianism.  It seems that sometimes the philosophy of libertarianism gets confused with the Libertarian US political party which espouses minarchist small govt capitalism.  The word communism gets confused in the same way.  There is a political economic philosophy which is completely (and originally I might add, in the French anarchist movement) compatible with libertarianism, and there is the ruling authoritarian political party in the Soviet Union that used the same name.  So by co-opting the names of philosophies for political parties with a narrow and one sided interpretation of said philosophy, the confusing situation arises where there is a libertarian and communist philosophy that is completely compatible and communist and libertarian political parties that are completely opposite on the political spectrum.  The opposite of libertarianism is not communism, it\u2019s authoritarianism.  \n\nOn a more personal note, my personal beliefs with libertarianism is that people should be able to freely associate and fully and democratically self rule.  It\u2019s my opinion that the the more broad the governing body, the less power it should have.  If a town wants to run itself as a socialist commune or anarchocapitalist enclave, that\u2019s their prerogative.  Want no guns in cities but all the guns in the country?  Go for it.

I wanted to give my insight as a small business owner (I own many small businesses) of how much it costs to run a business. Every year my business earns a gross of $1,345,234 per year. Here is a breakdown of my expenses:\n\nWages (including Obamacare insurance): $445,843\n\nRent: $143,290\n\nInventory: $246,720\n\nSexual harassment lawsuit payout: $297,047\n\nEquipment: $130,582\n\nThat leaves me with a profit of $81,752. With a margin that small for the expenses small businesses all over America face, where I haven\u2019t even taken into account pay for myself and for debts I owe on this business, how am I supposed to run a successful business if minimum wage goes up? What wiggle room do I even have? Think about that leftists.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Minimum wage from a business owner\u2019s standpoint"}

Let me know what you think.\n\nThe gist of it is, strongly suggest/require community based training in order to own a gun. Have different degrees of training in order to own different types of guns.\n\nHow it would work: I want to own a gun. I would need to get a \"mentor.\" He/she would ensure I was trained properly, knew how to operate the gun safely and not a risk to the community. This \"certification\" perhaps could not be done for profit, meaning it would need to be community based.  This mentor would not be a government official and it would not be a shack on the side of the road.  Maybe it could be commercial, I'm not sure.\n\nIf I went and killed someone, it would have no legal repercussions against the person who mentored me, but it would make for problems of conscience.\n\nIt would be like boy scouts crossed with gun certification. A real human would always be judging, \"do I want this guy/girl to be my student, is he ok.\" If I went and tried to buy a gun without any mentor signature, it would be a red flag that something's a bit off.  I would still be able to buy the gun, but perhaps with more scrutiny.\n\nFurthermore, \"mentors\" could involve the \"student\" in their community.  Provide tips.  Check in on them.  Etc.  Most of the time, the mentors would be much older than the students, so would also be reliable information source (knows the ropes).\n\n--\n\n(I posted a version of this to \"r/gundebates\" but then I realized that they just post tv debate times.)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Gun control possibility?

I'm a repeal the NFA, GCA, and Hughes Amendment kind of guy for prospective. \n\nI do not think any pro-gun nor anti-gun legislation with or without direct compromise (think FOPA with Hughes Amendment) will come to fruition, but I'm interested in creative solutions positing to solve firearm homicides without involving firearms directly. In essence, a compromise to circumvent firearm legislation altogether. Some ideas I've seen, some of which are incongruent with Libertarian ideologies but these are solely examples, are:\n\n1. Key cards at every entrance in all educational institutions.\n2. Clear back packs and gym bags in grade school. \n3. Build police stations next to schools like certain EMS stations.\n4. Well- maintained metal detectors at every entrance and exit in schools, social events, malls, theaters, etc. \n5. Subsidize mental healthcare.\n6. Legalize assisted suicide.\n7. Actually Fix NICS, and don't tac on superfluous restrictions like last time. \n8. Allow private citizens to access NICS. \n9. Train teachers to recognize patterns of lonely children\n10. More public school funding for additional counselors, add psychologists, and smaller classroom sizes. \n11. Bulletproof doors, and windows in schools, malls, and theaters. \n12. Security fobs worn by teachers to alert a security threat, and locks down schools. \n13. Direct le comm via box in classrooms.\n14. Lock ALL doors automatically, alarms sound when do is propped in all educational institutions. \n15. Be aggressive during active shooter rather than huddle in corner\n16. Carry door stop to prop doors shut during active shooter\n17. Lock all doors and sound alarm automatically during active shooter in schools and malls.\n\nMy question is, can you think of anything that could reduce shootings without restricting or expanding firearm rights? \n\nJust for clarification, I think the best solution would be allow firearms to be carried essentially everywhere. \n\nThank you so much for your time.

{"author":"Poundman82","created_utc":1519412657,"num_comments":30,"score":0,"selftext":"So, I'm certainly a minority here. I'm a libertarian that's for banning bump stocks, semi-automatic rifles, and enlarged clips. That sentence alone will get me a lot of heat, but let me explain why I'm for banning those things.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nQuick note: Mass shootings are different from random acts of violence in homes and on street corners because stopping them would require an even higher level of government intervention in regards to gun laws while also probably requiring an expansion of the police state and more invasion of rights. Mass shootings can probably be curbed with fairly minor intervention and effort *if* everyone can be brought on board together.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat attracted me to the Libertarianism ideology was that the government should not dictate social morality or infringe on individual's rights so long as no other parties are being harmed. Other parties are being harmed now, though. The kids being shot in schools and concert goers are having their rights (mainly the right to, like, not die) infringed upon. The government should then take action to protect their rights, as that is one of the primary functions of government. I feel like because gun ownership rights are on paper (Amendment 2) that it takes precedence over one's right to safety and breathing, which should be considered a universal right among all people.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAfter spending some time thinking about, it seems like any solution is going to impede on someone's rights. The government's hand has been forced by its people. Due to mass shootings over the last 18 years in particular, anything the government does is effectively discriminating against a group of people's rights, even if their action is nothing. The question then becomes, who's rights do we knock down a peg?  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHere are some thoughts I've had so far:  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**1. We Do Nothing**  \n*Rights affected: Victims of Mass Shootings*    \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, we're already doing this. Congress has down virtually nothing over the last 32 mass shootings in the US since 2000. Do we have a right to safe public areas, or at least as safe as the law can make them without instituting a surveillance state? If we do, then every time a mass shooting occurs, the act of doing nothing is equivalent to the act of enabling the aggressor. If the answer is \"no\" then well, I'm not even sure what that means (maybe you guys can elaborate on what implications that would have?). I like to think that something like \"The right to not die needlessly when easily avoidable\" is a thing even if not in text somewhere. This is also not natural selection where some dumbass hurts himself, these are victims who are being punished through no fault of their own.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**2. Arming Teachers**  \n*Rights affected: Victims of Mass Shootings*  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor starters, this concept can only be used to minimalize casualties in school shootings, and does not apply anywhere else. It also would probably not minimalize shit because most gunmen kill themselves anyway (making armed teachers a minor deterrent if any) and because most school teachers are not retired Navy Seals. I can see the headlines now: \"School shooter kills 3, injures 6. Shot dead by teachers before he could shoot anyone else, they killed 6, injured 12. More at 11.\" It's honestly just not a very well thought out plan and has the same rights issue as point #1 while also forcing teachers who may be anti-gun to now carry and practice (for what I suspect would be at least 100 hours a year) shooting and emergency management.   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**3. Mandate Mental Health Checkups**  \n*Rights affected: Everyone*  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHey kids, do you like Orwellian societies? Well, great news, we have this new system where everyone has to report to their local Mental Health Evaluation Center every 5 years to be reviewed for wrongthink. Today we're looking for anyone thinking of shooting random people, tomorrow we're looking for anyone thinking about anything other than how great Big Brother is. Enjoy!  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOh, you were just thinking of increasing funding to our current system? What current system? Nobody wants to touch mental health because it's near impossible to predict someone's behavior from a few written tests and truly adequate testing would be like what I described above - and something like that would also cost an absurd amount of money to enact and manage. And what if you find someone is bipolar, now what? You take away their right to own a firearm because they *might* possibly with an almost non-existent percent chance \"flip out\" one day and start shooting people?  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI know, screw all that and just quadruple the FBI, CIA, and NSA budgets. Then we won't have anymore school shooters. Or any other freedoms at all beyond the superficial.   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**4. Ban Automatic and Semi-automatic Weapons and Modifications That Duplicate Automatic Weapon Functionality**  \n*Rights Affected: Gun Owners*  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis one stings doesn't it? Gun owners have a right to their guns. Taking these things away would be impeding on their rights. There's no defense for taking this course of action other than to protect the basic rights to live for other people who are routinely victims of these weapons. That's why I created this topic in the first place. I love my guns, but I have a 7 year old and love him too. There's a reason we have an endless debate raging on this topic, and it's because there will be no winners. Someone is going to lose, there is no cure for mass shootings in America without taking something from someone. The answer, if we ever proceed with one, will result in only losers (and no one wants to lose). There are some arguments here I'd like to address real fast:  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPeople will say \"I need to protect myself from the government!\" Bro this is 2018. Your Vietnam references are obsolete. If the government decides to take your guns by force there's not much you can do about it. We got drones and hackers that can take over your Microwave and TV and shit. You have no idea how out-gunned you really are if you think your AR-15 offers you some form of protection against government tyranny. Your bank account would be frozen, your access to the outside world removed, means on transportation and any electronic devices in your life shut down. You could run in the woods and tell people you're a freedom fighter, but you'd be a homeless woods man with no way to reliable communicate with the outside world - call yourself whatever you want lol. Fact is if we become the next Afghanistan then American has already fallen and we have all failed as a nation.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOther will say \"enforce the gun laws we already have!\" Not a terrible idea, but how effective are we talking about here in terms of keeping an assault rifle away from a shooter? 99%? The number of people committing mass shootings is less than a thousandth of a percent. 1% is still too much leeway. Would it be possible for the aggressor to break into his neighbor house and just take his assault rifle? Do you implement new laws that require stricter gun storage and security? How do you enforce that?   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nGun smugglers will always be a thing, but that kid from Florida for example was not some well connected mobster or something. He used what was a readily available and easily accessible.   \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI also don't think that banning the type of weapons and modifications we're talking about would snowball into a \"let's ban all guns now\" movement. This is because we're America and do everything our own way, which is to usually do something 50%. Centralized healthcare? We did it 50%. Civil rights? A strong 50% showing. Corporate regulations? 50% there. Public school system? Our 50% will at least guarantee minimum requirements! We won't ban guns completely because that would be doing something 100%, and that's just now what we do. I know that's not a scientific or academic point, but hey, prove me wrong.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**5. Enhance Security at Schools**  \n*Rights affected: Students*  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis, like the earlier points, only really affects students. The amount of security required would be no less than metal detectors at every entrance, a proper full-time security team, probably complete with trained dogs for drug and bomb sniffing (because why not if we're going this far) and at minimum random unwarranted inspections of student's possessions. This is an expensive option as this would have to be done at every school, and at that point we should just send kids to prison everyday and teach them in there. You could also do away with schools and just teach everyone from home. There's a whole slew of issues with that as well, but for now we'll just assume *most* kids still need a centralized place to go for schooling.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI've already written way more than I intended to and I'm going to have to stop here. There were even a couple more points I wanted to make. All I know is every time I think about this issue trying to figure out a solution to suggest I come back with a group of people that will have their rights infringed upon in some way. I'm sure some people will just troll and flame, but I'm interested in an actual discussion with some of you. What are your thoughts?  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nJust to clarify real fast: I have no expectations of stopping mass shootings completely, just to greatly reduce them and their impact. There are no guarantees.   ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"So, who's rights are we OK with infringing upon in the name of safer public spaces?"}

{"author":"ChiefPeePants","created_utc":1519443903,"num_comments":7,"score":2,"selftext":"After identifying myself as a fiscally Conservative social Libertarian, a user on another sub asked me what my thoughts were on Healthcare.  I spent so long writing this that I hate to let it die on the tail end of a tiny thread that will never see the light of day.  Frankly, it felt GREAT to write all of this out. \n\nI humbly submit this, my first Reddit post ever, for your review, critique, discussion, and other forms of non-violent communication.  Thanks!\n------\nAfter giving an hour-and-a-half lecture to the entire population of the earth on the subject, all in my head, of course,  I have boiled the fundamentals of my views of what Libertarianism should be, including healthcare, down to the following (pardon the formatting, I'm on mobile):\n\n1)Our time and labor yield \"earned value\" that we call money, which allows us to easily access all the things for which we would like to trade our time and labor, both needs and wants.  Your desk job at XYZ Corp does not have to benefit Farmer Jed's Beef Ranch in order for you to get his delicious ground chuck, thanks to money.\n\n2)Money, therefore, is the conduit by which people express what is most important to them; they are trading their very lives for money every day when they spend time trying to gain money.\n\n3)The greatest right every person on earth should have is freedom to do with their lives as they wish, so long as they don't harm others.  I believe this is God-given, but you don't have to agree with that in order for the whole argument to make sense.  To me, if the most powerful entity in all time and existence gives us the freedom to turn our backs to Him and even deny His existence, is that not the ultimate example that freedom is of the highest importance to Him?  Moving right along...\n\n4)Various choices in life lead to various amounts of money, but that money, in whatever amount it is, represents the value society has placed on our contribution to it, and, therefore, the influence we are able to exert back upon society with that money, if we so choose.\n\n5) Therefore, when the government collects taxes from citizens, it is taking the asset the citizens  have literally traded their lives to attain.  That is the reason I believe the government should keep taxes to a minimum.  They should accomplish this by providing only for the common good in ways the private sector cannot, such as the military, legal/justice system, etc.  Anything that can reasonably be provided for in the private sector, should be.  By \"the private sector\" I mean the free market, constrained by law just enough to penalize those acting against the common good, where citizens are able to vote for what's important to them with their money.\n\n\n**Alright, so those are what I would call \"the fundamentals\" of my take on Libertarianism (I'm sure I'm leaving something out, but this is at least good enough to let us advance to the discussion of healthcare).  So, let's talk healthcare!**\n\nWe're starting this topic with a bang: HEALTHCARE IS NOT A RIGHT.  If something is a right, there must be a way to ensure that it is provided.  If someone tries to take your rights, we focus on restoring your rights, then on  punishments that discourage such behavior.  How does this apply to a hypothetical \"right to medical care\"?  How could we possibly force someone to administer medical care?  People CHOOSE to become doctors, nurses, EMTs, lab techs, etc.  If there are not enough trained professionals to care for every ailment, what could we do?  Take the freedom of children or adults and force them into training for a new career? No, there is no \"right\" to healthcare.  As such, it should be handled in the private sector: let the people decide what is most important to them with the dollars that represent their lives, and let the government make sure the private sector is playing fair. \n\nNeither you nor I should ever be compelled by the gov't to pay for someone else's medical treatment.  My money is for my life and my choices.  Likewise, I should not expect other people to pay my medical bills, unless I have prearranged that, such as with health insurance.\n\nSo here's where this discussion typically gets derailed, assuming you make it through the \"healthcare is not a right\" section: \"You mean you wouldn't give some of your money to save someone else's life?  You fiend!!  How could money be more important than a human LIFE!!  You are despicable!! I can't even have a logical conversation with you, for you are evil incarnate!  Satan, I tell you!\"  Etc, etc, ad nauseum.  This is simply untrue and misses the point of freedom.  I would (and do now) gladly give some of my money on a regular basis to try and help other people, including with their medical bills.  Many others would (and do), too!  I do not, however, require any other person on Earth to do with their money (their very LIVES, if you remember) what I think is right; your life is yours, my life is mine, because FREEDOM is the ultimate right in civilization.  This is why gov't and taxation  do not belong in healthcare.\n\nIf the government would back off of our pocketbooks and stop compelling us to pay for lots of things many of us do not value at all or that could be done more efficiently/cost-effectively in the private sector, we would have more money available to let the rest of the world know what we really care about.  In this case, I and many others would have the financial ability to help people with their medical bills.  For some, advancing science is the greatest goal, others may want to devote their money to helping those in need, or solving a very particular problem, or even just having as much fun as possible before dying - your goals don't have to be altruistic or \"right\" to me, as long as it doesn't hurt others, it's none of my business!\n\nSo there you have it: my opinion.\n\nTL;DR: I'll pay your bills if I want to, not because the gov't makes me","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Fundamentals of Freedom and Healthcare"}

The prevailing idea seems to be that government should not pose any/minimal amount of regulations on what people shouls be able to do, no matter what the topic is, including guns. So people want to have guns, let them. But another recurring theme in those discussions is that government should not be trusted and if Americans lose their guns, government will have the ability to subdue the citizens in brutal ways since they won't have the means to protect themselves anymore.\n\nSo since libertarianism defends that government involvement should be kept very low in almost every aspect, what is the place of law enforcement in a perfectly libertarian society? Should the police forces have guns, and if yes, how heavily should they be able arm themselves? Also would libertarianism give all the people the freedom to exact justice themselves? If I am understanding correctly, the justice system in a libertarian society would allow everyone to do as they please as long as they don't interfere with others' liberties, but when the occasional crime happens, who would be trusted to carry out the judgement? \n\nTL;DR - Generally, how would the law enforcement and justice system in a perfectly libertarian society differ from today's US?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Noob question: what would be the role of law enforcement in a perfectly libertarian country?"}

I probably won't reply to any comments, but I thought it was worth sharing.\n\nLast year, my son had off from school for some holiday or other.  My wife and I had work the next day so we went to bed and told my son to make sure he was in bed by midnight.  Well, he's a teenager, so he stayed up much longer.\n\nThe next day, I'm sitting home and two police detectives show up at my door and tell me I need to go to the police station with my son.  I was like WTF?!\n\nSo, we drive over and I learn that my son was severely bullied by 3 kids he thought were his close friends and he got VERY upset.  He got mad, and then went online and posted the following on Snapchat \"Now I know how Eric Harris felt.\"\n\nMy life for the last year has been turned upside down and has been a living hell.  My son went through 3 different psychiatric evaluations that day and was allowed to return to my house when all 3 therapists concluded the he was a threat to no one, and that the one line was not a threat to anyone.  But the next day, he was not allowed to go to school and was arrested and finger printed for making \"terroristic threats\".  He was released into my custody, and the school principal attempted to intervene to allow him to return to school, because he said my son was a model student.  The DA wanted my son expelled and sent to a juvenile prison/school.\n\nAfter an insane amount of psychiatric evaluations, and the recommendations of the school principal, 4 teachers, and the local police force, he was finally allowed to return to school, under the condition that the local police place an armed officer in the school from that day until the end of the year.\n\n2 months later we appeared in court.  My son was sentenced to even more psychiatric counseling including \"intense family therapy\", was put on on 8:00 PM curfew, was forced into a mentoring program, and was given 60 hours of community service.  He was assigned 2 probation officers, and they could come in at any time and search the entire house for weapons or drugs if they wanted to without a warrant.\n\nThe entire time we had counselors coming out to the house, they would always say \"I don't even know why I am here.  He doesn't need my services.  He's a well adjusted kid in a stable home with lots of friends.\"  We had people coming in and out of our house 5 days a week and weekends tied up in community service.\n\n1 year of living hell.\n\nFor far less than that idiot in Florida.  One snapchat post turned my life upside down.  But somehow this idiot was allowed to buy weapons and get on the school property.\n\nAmerica, you reallu confuse me sometimes.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"In the wake of the Broward County Shooting, I thought I would share a story..."}

If you shirk the notion that you choose your sexual philosophy, then you're doomed to living a sexual philosophy that you believe you can't change- when you can.\n\nGiven that libertarians skews towards both asociality and high intelligence, we're predisposed to thinking in lieu of imitation. And given society's cost/benefit of marriage and family, our sexual preference skews towards traps- traps offer a comparable sexual experience to that of women, without the detriment of children or the female temperament.\n\nYou are a man, be rational.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Rational Sexual Preference"}

Some might prefer to call it by its scientific name, Rosa, and others just call it \"That red flower that you give your significant other,\" but they are all referring to the same thing.\n\nIs it also true that a rose with many scents has none? Meaning that if no one can agree on what a rose smells like, then it becomes impossible to determine what its true scent is? This idea could be applied to many things in modern American society, like how we go about discussing racism, gender roles, and the presence of the all-terrifying \"Nazis\" that plague our society. If we, as a society, cannot agree on what constitutes as racism, violence, free speech, etc, then don't those words begin to lose meaning completely?

This sub generally promotes arguments with higher levels of logic and there is better discourse here than probably any other political sub.  However, I feel like there is a serious logical flaw with the way pro-gun advocates are presenting their arguments.\n\nLibertarians use the phrasing of \"taking away rights\" when talking about gun control.  Here's a hypothetical: if you were mega-wealthy and could afford scientists and machinery, etc. to build your own nuclear bomb, should that be within your rights?  Since that's illegal, does that mean the government took away your rights to a nuke?  I would say that's not necessarily a right you should have in the first place.  Nukes are an extreme example I'm using to make the point, but you could back that down to something like a fighter jet or a tank and see how we probably wouldn't want individuals with that kind of firepower.  So I don't see this argument as being so fundamental as rights vs. no rights, it's just a grey area of how much firepower are you willing to accept that individuals may have.  Libertarians are likely to say somewhere at semi-automatic or higher-power, whereas I'd draw my line at single-fire pistols, shotguns, rifles, etc.\n\nPoint being, using the phrasing of \"taking away rights\" seems to completely ignore the actual issue at hand (mass homicidal capabilities in the hands of dangerous people).  It just makes the government sounds like the bad guy even though collectively we have to draw a line somewhere.  Just because that line isn't where you think it should be doesn't mean anyone took away your rights, it just means that you have a disagreement on this grey area.\n\nAs a lurker, thank you for the hospitality and looking forward to the discussion.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"A gun control question for the sub."}

{"author":"JackFisherBooks","created_utc":1519778946,"num_comments":7,"score":2,"selftext":"This is something I find myself contemplating more and more as I read about advances in artificial intelligence. One of the bedrock principles of Libertarian thought is that governments are inherently inefficient. There's an abundance of evidence behind that, a lot of which I see mentioned on this sub. In order to preserve life, liberty, and property, the size and scope of the government needs to be minimized. It's run by fallible people with conflicting interests, agenda, morals, etc. In that context, Libertarian principles make sense.\n\nHowever, advances in artificial intelligence may very well change that dynamic. At the rate AI is advancing, it's quite possible that we'll see within our lifetime an intelligence that is many times greater than that of the average human. In theory, an advanced AI could function more efficiently than any human government/business/enterprise could ever function. It could actually manage laws and the economy to an extent that's superior than that of fallible humans. If it's advanced enough, it could work on a level that even the smartest human cannot contemplate.\n\nNow, I'm not advocating that we create an AI to run our government. Most people today would probably be too scared to place that much trust in an AI. But what about the people of tomorrow? Would future generations actively work towards this in hopes of creating a better government than any human government in history?\n\nI thought I'd ask this question because advances in AI are going to raise all sorts of questions about how we live, work, and manage our lives. At some point, it's going to advance to a point where it's going to be smarter than any human. When that happens, do libertarian ideals as they currently exist become obsolete?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Does The Potential Of Advanced Artificial Intelligence Undercut The Basis Of Libertarian Philosophy?"}

I've always been very libertarian except for where it comes to healthcare as the american healthcare system has a lot of extra fees which make it expensive (1. insurance middleman, and 2. hospital billing departments which have to keep track of which item is being charged to which patient. sometimes billing departments can be up to 10% of hospitals budget).\n\nthere is obviously all the bloat that comes with government in Australian, Canadian, and English health care as well, but in my opinion to a lesser extent than insurance companies.\n\nSo although it would be impossible to ever switch to this system i am proposing, here is my libertarian solution and I would love gentle discussion:\n\n1. All hospitals/clincs in a city are privately owned \n2. you need a membership to use a hospital/clinic except for emergency rooms which would need to be publically funded (boo i know, but stay with me)\n3. membership costs at a hospital/clinic are exactly equal to yearly costs/number of members. Meaning that the entire cost of the hospital would be split between members\n\nThe benefits:\n\n1. YOU WOULD NOT BE PAYING FOR ANYONE WHO ISNT PAYING FOR YOU as with socialist medicine. \n\n2. billing would be extremely easy\n\n3. insurance wouldn't be necessary as your membership would essentially be an insurance policy\n\n4. if you wanted better healthcare you become a member of a hospital with less members\n\n5. if you wanted cheaper healthcare you become a member of a hospital with more members\n\n6. hospitals would compete for the best/cheapest health care to win your business. \n\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: formatting","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Idea for a better libertarian healthcare system"}
