It often times annoys me because they all voted for Trump, not because they actually like Trump but simply because between him vs. a Democrat, they felt like Trump's America would be less intrusive to the \"free market\" they imagine exists and to individual liberties.\n\nI think what Libertarians often times fail to grasp is that without sensible regulation and government intervention, the nature of wealth is to concentrate in the hands of a very small group of individuals.  They like to imagine this fair, egalitarian playing field where the opportunities and obstacles we all face are the same, and where outcomes are determined by individual merits.  Work ethos, intelligence, education, etc.  I think that point of view is hopelessly naive.  Previous generations of people have set up a society where (to use baseball metaphors) some people are born on third base, and other people are born at home plate, and some people are born in the parking lot, etc.  And the people born on third base have used their individual liberties to set things up in such a way that people who were born into less fortunate circumstances will always be fighting an uphill battle, not because of regulation or government interference in the market, but simply as a feature of market capitalism.  \n\nAlso, the idea that \"taxation is theft\" is, to me, a horrid misunderstanding of what society is, what money is, and what taxes are.  If we're talking about 2,000 years ago where there were some people who had to be 100 percent self-reliant, I could get behind the idea that taxation is theft.  However in 2018 America, no one is anywhere near self-reliant.  There are schools and roads and police and a military and a host of other national institutions that constitute this society we live in, and none of our lives would be possible without those things.  Well, maybe one or two of us, but the exceptions prove the rule.  If we go to work for a company that pays us a salary, Libertarians imagine that they \"earned\" 100 percent of that money, when in fact they didn't.  That company could only exist in the first place because of the society built around it, and that employee can only access that company and the benefits from working for it because of the society built around it.  So to earn that money without paying anything back to the society in order to sustain it, is actually theft.  Taxes are not theft, but earning money and not paying taxes on it, is theft.  Your'e stealing from society if you don't sustain the society that enabled you to earn the money.\n\nFurther, the one area where I tend to agree with Libertarians is in the realm of social freedoms.  Ie marriage laws, freedom to smoke pot or use drugs, reproductive freedom, etc.  However, Libertarians either A: Vote Republican because they care more about economic freedom than they do about social freedom, or B: Vote for a Libertarian candidate, who if elected would have no choice in congress or the senate but to end up backing Republicans in most cases in order to get anything accomplished.  So by throwing their political support behind Republicans, Libertarians are actively contributing to a party who wants to erode social freedoms in favor of religious-themed regulation and intrusion into our social lives.\n\nIn short, I see Libertarian ideology as an ideology that may have made some sense at different points in history, but is fundamentally incompatible with life in 2018 in an industrialized nation.  And I see most Libertarians as confused and uninformed as to how modern life actually works.","subreddit":"changemyview","title":"CMV: Libertarians are often times naive about how the world actually works.""num_comments":1,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"CMV: Libertarians are often times naive about how the world actually works."}

We should allow for enough welfare to grant people the right to Life, Liberty, and Property. That being said, the amount it takes to ensure that for everyone is rather low. The government should have the power to grant the ability of the rights mentioned above, but it has no duty in giving people happiness. That being said, programs that are meant to increase happiness I'd scrap entirely. I also happen to have a soft-spot for children, so bear that in mind. If I were to change America's Welfare System, this is what I'd have in it:\n\n\\- Food vouchers that give an extremely poor family of four enough to eat 3 meals a day, every day, so as long as they're employed for a majority of the year or are extremely disabled\/elderly\n\n\\- Housing vouchers that either pay for a family's rent every month or allow a family to use an allocated public housing space with heating and electric, so as long as they're employed for a majority of the year or are extremely disabled\/elderly\n\n\\- Private Education vouchers for everyone (valued up to $7k-13k\/year). Children go through developmental stages in life and if these stages aren't met, it can leave a child mentally disabled and bind them to mediocrity for the rest of their lives. Not to mention that some degree of education and development is needed to hold down a job.\n\n\\- Private Health Insurance for people who are incredibly disabled to the point of where they'd die without assistance (done via large tax breaks for insurance companies and hospitals)\n\n\\- Require employers give either private health insurance to an employee's family or buy medication for them whenever an illness that is cheap to treat comes up (done through a scrapping of the minimum wage, a removal of anti-trust laws, and removal of most zoning laws)\n\n\\- Government-run (or private subsidizing) for orphanages to prevent young children from being out on the street and possibly a day-care or two for single mothers\n\n\\- Vouchers for private ambulatory and fire insurance\n\n\\- Force doctors to treat illnesses that would cause immediate harm to organs or possibly lead to death, regardless of pay. However, the hospital would then have the right to constrain that person or their parent's labor to pay up to 150% of the original cost of treatment (with restrictions on age and work hours).\n\nOutside of this, I'd axe everything else.

No hours a week at a dollar sixty comes to nothing. Let\u2019s suppose there\u2019s a teenager whom you as an employer would be perfectly willing to hire for a dollar fifty an hour. But the law says, no, it\u2019s illegal for you to hire him at a dollar fifty an hour. You must hire him at a dollar sixty. Now, if you hire him at a dollar sixty, you\u2019re really engaging in an act of charity. You\u2019re paying a dollar fifty for his services and you\u2019re giving him a gift of 10 cents. That\u2019s something few employers, quite naturally, are willing to do or can afford to do without being put out of business by less generous competitors. As a result, the effect of a minimum-wage law is to produce unemployment among people with low skills. And who are the people with low skills? In the main, they tend to be teenagers and blacks, and women who have no special skills or have been out of the labor force and are coming back. This is why there are abnormally high unemployment rates among these groups.\n\n&gt; In 1956, I think, the minimum was raised from seventy-five cents to a dollar\u2014a very substantial rise. In the early Fifties, the unemployment rate among male teenagers was about the same for blacks as for whites. Both were about eight percent when the over-all unemployment rate was about four percent. In the late Fifties, after the minimum-wage rate was raised from seventy-five cents to a dollar, the unemployment rate of black teenagers shot up from eight percent to something like 20 to 25 percent. For white teenagers, it shot up to something like 13 percent. From that day to this, the rates for both black and white teenagers have been higher than before 1956. When they start to decline, a new rise in the minimum-wage rate comes along and pushes them up again. The black teenage rate has been very much higher than the white teenage rate, for reasons that are highly regrettable and that we ought to be doing something about: Blacks get less schooling and are less skilled than whites. Therefore, the minimum-wage rate hits them particularly hard. I\u2019ve often said the minimum-wage rate is the most anti-Negro law on the books.\n\n[Source] (https:\/\/www.americanexperiment.org\/2018\/05\/milton-friedman-on-the-minimum-wage\/)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Minimum Wage is a racist policy.

So to put it in a simple way: other than accounts breaking the law, users would regulate the community as a whole. The platform also charges no fees and takes no cuts from its users' sales, so all transactional aspects are controled by the users. In other words: buyers and vendors negotiate directly with each other with no interference from a middleman in any point. All payment methods are accepted, including cryptocurrencies, and you can even make payments outside the platform. If you would like to know more about what we're building, you can access our website: [wheelofcommerce.com](https:\/\/www.wheelofcommerce.com\/).\n\nSomething many of you will be interested in: for the open beta, we'll fund the service through equity crowdfunding.

Individual freedom can't exist if two agents exist.\n\nNow what if we examine \"freedom\" in another way? Instead of thinking of freedom as something we all possess individually, why not consider it something we all possess collectively? What I'm saying is that perhaps the pursuit of individual freedom is actually the pursuit of oppression. The corollary is that temperance is true freedom.\n\nWe focus so much on what we are free to do that we've lost sight of what we're free NOT to do.\n\nIn keeping with the paradox, true freedom is the ability to deny yourself of freedom.\n\nThank you for your time.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Breaking the Echo Chamber"}

One of these is my support for \"socialised healthcare\", as it is often phrased; more specifically, the NHS.\n\nThe NHS is, and always has been, extremely popular in the UK and I'm certainly not in the minority here. It has averaged around 77% support through two  decades for maintaining it in its current form, and 90% of the UK public  support its founding principles. Almost four out of five people (77 per  cent) believe that \u2018the NHS is crucial to British society and we must  do everything we can to maintain it\". 90% of the UK public believe that  it should continue to be funded through taxation. [Source](https:\/\/www.kingsfund.org.uk\/publications\/what-does-public-think-about-nhs): Ipsos MORI, one of the largest survey institutions in the world.\n\nLike  any other service, it has its struggles, but quality of care has  remained acceptable. The reason for the decline in care recently is not  because it is a publicly funded institution, or a monopoly, or lacks  competition, or because of immigrants. It is largely because, like many  other rich countries, the UK has an ageing population, and old people  cost more. Demand has gone up, and supply of money has gone down, because the NHS has had several real-terms funding decreases. This is not a problem with its ideology, or socialism, but simple economics (and I don't pretend to be an expert on this)\n\nThe  UK is more efficient at healthcare spending. If you look at total  amounts spent in either country, the UK spends about half as much as the  US on healthcare, while the US was ranked last out of 11 countries in  the US-based thinktank, the [Commonwealth Fund](https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/health-40608253).  The UK was ranked first. Even if you then ignore private healthcare  spending, about half of the US's spending and about 12% of the UK's  spending, then the UK still spends less, both as a proportion of GDP and  as an amount per capita. [Source](https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-42950587): the BBC, another great publicly funded institution.\n\nTherefore, as in any free market situation, the NHS is a product that for me provides very good value for money. Why should I support a private system over this purely because I don't like the 'socialised' tag?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"About the NHS"}

I am interested in knowing the very basics on how the economy works. Why is production, and not spending growing the economy. What is economic growth to begin with. Why is production important. Why is investment important. Why are savings important. But i also want to get an understanding of other alternatives, and why are they -- presumably -- wrong. \n\nI  bought and read Peter Schiff's book - ''How an economy grow, and why it  crashes'' hoping i would get a good basic understanding, but while he  did cover the basics i was looking for, he didn't touch on them in more depth, overall i was disappointed in the book. Not only he did not cover  more details on the basics of economic expansion, but he rarely even  discussed alternative views and how his arguments compare to others. There were so many questions i was asking myself while reading -- what about this, what about that etc. that were left unanswered. \n\nI  then bought Capitalism and Freedom by Milton Friedman, i am currently  reading it but i am already disappointed. This book does not talk about  economic expansion and basic economics, it is too abstract, and  philosophy-oriented, not to mention the overly complicated language used. \n\nI  was considering buying Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt, but  judging by the table of content, and many of the negative feedback left  by other Libertarians and Fiscal Conservatives, it doesn't seem like  the book covers what i am looking for.  \n\nWhat other books would you recommend?

What if we allowed people from anywhere to immigrate under the pre-condition they work five-to-ten years under government projects? The immigrants would get food and shelter under the condition that they produce public works such as cleanup operations or help to build public housing. After the five-to-ten period, the immigrant and their family gets full citizenship. This should take care of concerns of both Republicans and Democrats. Towards the Republicans, these immigrants won\u2019t take American jobs. Not only that, but those who signed up would be workers at heart, so they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about these citizens being bums. Also, doing such a thing gives time for foreign business to come over here to generate more jobs. There\u2019d be no jobs to take if they were available to almost everyone. Towards the Democrats, these people would be able to enrich our nation with their culture. Immigrants would also not face the abuses they currently are down in ICE\u2019s concentration camps. Tell me what you think below.\n\nEDIT: The only reason I'm even advocating for such a plan is because I'm concerned that if millions of people migrated at once, our economy might not have enough jobs to supply everyone that needs to be employed, let alone allowing everyone to have up to two jobs if needed to assist in their income.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"An Open Border Plan"}

Those that are less fortunate living in the worst neighborhoods are being pounded by new laws and regulations limiting their ability to self defend themselves from the most horrendous kinds of evil. \n\nI am a firm supporter of bitcoin because of it's decentralized nature that is squarely out of the control of the Fed and any money printing machine that devalues a populations savings with yet another hidden tax, again on the most vulnerable.  \n\nBut I'm also a believer in the scientific method!  I trust science and it's findings on climate change, evolution, etc.  I can't understand why people hate Tesla and Elon Musk so much, especially libertarians that complain about so called subsidies but not a word about the outrageous oil subsidies that continue today. \n\nI can go on and on but my question is, am I alone?  Am I the only left leaning libertarian there is?  If not who represents us?  I can't stand the thought of voting for a republican because, among many other things, I believe it's a women's choice to abort and it's fucking crazy to think that they would have to do backyard abortions or late stage abortions because pro-lifers (clearly majority republican) want to get rid of local providers or worse, overturn Roe V. Wade.  \n\nI also believe investing in our states and our country through taxation is not a bad thing, and I wonder how we ever created our highway system when now we can't even replace our light sensors to not be stupid and stay red when no car is around, in 2018 when there are sensors and camera's everywhere these days, we can't update our traffic lights to better move traffic.  We were about to invest in another old turbo diesel electric train that wouldn't get finished for decades while other countries such as China, Japan, or Germany have Maglevs, electric magnetic levitating train that go over 200mph and continue to get faster, right now...not decades from now, while here we are with shit public transport and so called libertarians complaining about Tesla, and electric cars. \n\nIs there such a thing as a left leaning libertarian or am I in the wrong place?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Day by day I realize I am a left leaning (liberal) libertarian.

Have you ever had racist thoughts about minorities based on their voting patterns and political views?\n\nI won\u2019t lie, I have. In reality, I would never act racist towards anyone, but when I think about how minorities tend to vote Democrat (not that I think the Republican Party is any better), I just think about how they want to expand government, like how they aren\u2019t as smart as us libertarians about the damage of big government. I can probably assume that most voting Americans, not just minorities, are not very politically informed. But, it\u2019s hard not to think about how desperately the Democrats want the minority vote... It feels heart-breaking when my Asian mom votes Democrat (yeah plot twist I\u2019m mixed race)\n\nAnd that\u2019s where my racist thoughts come in. I think \u201cdammit these minorities are getting in the way of my libertarian paradise and they don\u2019t realize they\u2019re just pawns for the expanding government\u2019s agenda!\u201d And that conflicts with my libertarian principle that everyone, regardless of racial or gender identity, is an individual.\n\nBut wait, my \u201cracist thoughts\u201d also extend to white people. Specifically, white liberals. I feel as if they are the ones who are keeping minorities down, filling their heads with anti-white rhetoric and keeping them voting for Democrats. This might just be a very vocal minority (unironic SJW\u2019s) but no doubt they pose a threat to keeping minorities from being libertarian.\n\nOne last paragraph about my thoughts. I\u2019m also disgusted at minority conservatives\/Republicans, since I view conservatism as \u201chalf-assed libertarianism.\u201d I think \u201cdamn so close but they can\u2019t just be libertarian...\u201d and that conservatives drawing in minorities is taking away minorities from libertarian ideology.\n\ntl;dr I\u2019m pissed at minorities because they won\u2019t think the way I think (yeah I know that sounds fascist and somewhat childish)\n\nProbably gonna get a shitload of dislikes since my thoughts are clearly racist, but it\u2019s just something I need to get off my chest. Comment any similar thoughts you\u2019ve had or maybe offer advice, or not because I shouldn\u2019t force you to.

Those who create and take part in these race-baiting schemes tend to be quite vicious and vitriolic mostly against whites.  For the few past years, anti-white articles have being regularly popping up on progressive outlets, and their rhetoric is clear: Whites are oppressors \/ minorities are virtuous victims (Quite Marxist rhetoric if you ask me). Since this polarization is not likely to cease any time soon, the question now is: how can we best fight against it? \n\nInfluenced by Jordan B. Peterson, I was also of the belief that we must fight against identity politics with reason and individualism. \"Let's stop focusing on our collective identities, let's treat people as individuals!\". I guess that as libertarians we all really like this idea and so I did. However I now wonder, are we being idealists by thinking this way? Should we also engage in identity politics?\n\nIt turns out that being reasonable doesn't take you anywhere when dealing with people who are irrational, unreasonable and tribalistic. Their group must obtain power over yours, that's all they care about. Now, this is the key problem, how can we fight back racism on whites when whites are (generally) avoiding to put their in-group interests first?? In North America and Europe, whites are being constantly vilified for expressing their concerns on mass migration, multiculturalism, etc... In some places, politicians even claim their countries to have no core identity! Apparently, whites are not allowed to preserve or even celebrate their own cultural heritage. That would be racist, it is politically incorrect. \n\nSome people like The Red Elephant guy think that whites must embrace identity politics to have a chance in repelling this attack. I guess this is true, but to what extent should we engage in identity politics? I guess destroying white guilt and stopping whites' self-loathing parade is a good enough start. \n\nTo some extent we are already seeing this trend in the rise of right-wing populists and nationalists all around the West. However, what will result from that? I hope a better future. I mean, racism against whites is not acceptable, no kind of racism is acceptable. However, no one ever knows. Will we ever be able to respect each others without some groups trying to blame everything on others? Will we condemn and eradicate cultural marxism any time in the near future? \n\nHappy to hear your opinions and have a nice constructing debate.\n\nhttps:\/\/i.redd.it\/ss0gaxe8gwd11.png","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Embrace Your Identity as It's Your only Hope Now | Identity Politics"}

{"author":"alexander7k","created_utc":1533319004,"author":"alexander7k","created_utc":1533317007.0,"num_comments":57,"score":2,"selftext":"Since everyone here believes in a pure form of Capitalism, I am going to describe how that would look like, at least from a macro standpoint, I can't know every small detail of it, and I will leave out those parts that I haven't thought about. Then you should compare your views against this and see if they are consistent.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# 1) No Central Banks\n\nIn a true form of Capitalism, there would be no Central Banks. Central banks arise out of a necessity of banks engaging in massive fraud, and serve the purpose of trying to extend that fraud into a Ponzi Scheme via standardizing and devaluing currency to sustain it for a long period of time. In a perfect world, there would be no systematic fraud, fraud would be isolated events, and financial markets would be in a constant competition, and plenty of safeguards put in place to ensure that banks are honest and transparent.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# 2) No Fiat Currency\n\nSince fiat currency serves as an instrument to facilitate the above mentioned fraud, if there is no systemic fraud, then currency would be valuable, so none of the drawbacks of fiat currency would exist. Probably people would use Cryptocurrencies as they ensure transparency. Naturally fractional reserve banking would not exist either.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# 3) Competing Currencies\n\nThere would be no monopoly on any kind of currency. People would be free to choose what currency they want to use. So most people would probably use a variety of Cryptocurrencies, along side with precious metals, and other tokens. National currencies would be a thing of the past, we would have an array of currencies for people to choose from, maybe some of them would be fiat, like these gift cards, but most of them, certainly for wealth storage, would be transparent Blockchain based.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# 4) Lesser use of Custodianship\n\nPeople would emphasize more on having control over their property. Delegation is sometimes useful, but it should not be widespread, otherwise the risk of fraud increases again. Most people would want to control their Cryptocurrencies, like holding them on a hardware wallet, and not with a custodian, otherwise fractional reserve banking could come back. So it's very important for people to have direct and exclusive control over their property, otherwise the same corrupt system would come back.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# 5) Banks as storage facilities\n\nCommercial banks would no longer engage in fractional reserve banking, in fact they would not engage in lending at all. Banks would essentially be storage facilities where they would protect large assets from precious metals to currency, from theft, being fully insured and using the best physical or cybersecurity measures. Obviously for this they would charge a monthly fee. So they would just be storage facilities.\n\nEventually they could offer separate accounts where the funds are either lent out or invested in some markets. But this would fall onto the category of investment banking, and the bank would have to make it clear which account is which, so that people who just want to store their money safely, would have a 100% guarantee of their money being stored at 100% reserve, which would be inspectable and transparent, while those that just want to invest their money would also know the clear terms of that deal.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n# 6) Lending from capital\n\nLending would only happen from capital. If you have 100$ you can lend that out and charge whatever interest you want for that. There would be no fractional reserve system, no Ponzi Schemes and other forms of fraud. Private lenders could not engage in fraud since they use their own capital, and public lenders that use their assets under their management should be able to show Blockchain proof that they don't engage in a Ponzi Scheme.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# 7) Private Contractors\n\nThere would be no such thing as an \"employee\". The employee term indicates some kind of serfdom, and it has a lot of labor regulations attached to it. All forms of work for hire would be in a private contractor form, with terms agreed upon in a contract. Contractors would be able to set any terms they mutually agree upon.\n\nNow I am personally not a 100% voluntarist, so I would put here as a caveat that, perhaps contracts that would result in debt slavery or labor slavery or other forms of immoral outcomes would be invalid.\n\nYou could not sell yourself into bondage, because that would violate your sovereignty, also other forms of ridiculous outcomes like \"what if the child consents\", kinds of agreements would just be considered immoral things and invalid. \n\nSo you could agree on any terms except obvious instances where you are on the edge of morality.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# 8) Wages\n\nIn a true Capitalist world, wages would always go **DOWN**. Yes you heard that correctly. In a real Austrian Economy, wages would always go down. That is not a joke, that is really how it should be in a deflationary economy.\n\nYou see, if we would not be using fiat money, then the value of the money would always go up, and hence the wages would go down relative to that. \n\nThe good news is that prices would drop quicker than wages, so the prosperity of Average Joe would go up over time.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# 9) Social Security\/Welfare\n\nBecause the value of the currency would go up, there would be 0 need for a pension system. People would just work, put a side a little bit after every month and by the time they get old, the value of that savings would be so big that it would easily sustain their old years. \n\nThis is the best form of welfare that can exist. Prices going down and wealth going up. Poverty would be literally eliminated. \n\nEventually people could have a private pension account, but it would just be like a normal investment account in low risk markets, nothing special about it.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# 10) Poverty\n\nThere would be no poverty as prices would be so cheap that: food,water,housing, Internet could be given away for free by charities or as a **[FREEMIUM model](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Anarcho_Capitalism\/comments\/8ve9cn\/freemium_model\/)** by businesses, to less fortunate people.\n\nMost people could easily find a profession to make money from, it would be very easy because each market would be saturated with products and services. Competition would be fierce, but if somebody just can't make it, then charities or FREEMIUM businesses can just take care of them.\n\nIn case of a sudden loss of job, people could always take out an insurance against that.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# 11) Capital Markets\n\nThere would be no securities regulations. So raising funds would be literally as easy as creating an ICO in Ethereum. Anyone could just solicit for capital and issue their own securities without any laws blocking them.\n\nSure there will be some fraud, but investors would increasingly demand guarantees against fraud, transparency, 3rd party auditors, and perhaps some collateral in escrow as well. It would be voluntary, but required if want to be taken seriously.\n\nCurrent regulations don't stop fraud, [Bernie Madoff got away with it for 30 years](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Madoff_investment_scandal) I believe. So regulators are worth shit. Regulation just monopolizes fraud, it doesn't end it. \n\nSo we are much better off with a few 3rd world boiler rooms hustling a few grands, than with billion dollar Ponzi Schemes. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# 12) Taxes\n\nI am not 100% Ancap so for now I would settle with a Minarchist Government, just to manage the military and the integrity of a country. We don't really want McNukes, I find that silly.\n\nSo there has to be some kind of taxes. I believe the best form of taxes which are non-invasive are land-taxes. It's the only form of taxes that make sense.\n\nYou own a land, and if you want the military to protect it, then you have to pay a \"fee\", which would be this land tax. Now we can't let freeloaders get away, and also I believe it's much more efficient if there is just 1 military. I don't think competing DRO's are a good idea, sounds like a mafia turf war.\n\nSo just have land taxes, which would be proportional to the size of a land you own. Either you own land, or you rent it, either way this tax would be charged. So each 6 months say, the military would set it's budget, and then the budget would be divided across each land-owner resident proportionally weighted by the size of the land they own. Pretty simple and efficient.\n\nNo other taxes.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n# 13) Medical Care\n\nCurrently the best thing would be a myriad of competing private hospitals, research laboratories, and medicine manufacturers. But in the future I believe we will have healing nanobots so this will not even be an issue later.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# 14) Education\n\nA bunch of private institutions, non-profits or private tutors that would teach kids efficient curriculums that are relevant to the real world, not some obsolete garbage. \n\nThe curriculum can be standardized, just like ISO , a non-profit NGO standardizes engineering standards, education could be standardized as well, but that doesn't mean that it would have to be enforced, and the organizations would have plenty of autonomy to organize how they want to teach.\n\nThere is also plenty of free supplementary knowledge on the Internet and behind paywalls. A well made video guide with a paid tutor would be much more efficient in many cases than 4 years at a University. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n# 15) Rights\n\nObviously we are talking about natural rights. The basic natural rights and principles of morality would apply to all humans, and to a certain extent to animals.\n\nNow to what degree I don't know. Perhaps to mammals only. And a ban on torture of animals, that is just immoral. But other than that, the other animals should not have rights. I don't want the world being overtaken by vegans. I like my meat, and although it's bad how pigs and chickens get slaughtered,  I just can't give up on a juicy stake or a chicken leg.\n\nObviously rights should not be extended to AI robots. So fuck the leftists that want to give rights to robots.\n\nObviously rights should not be extended to corporations either. In fact no organization should have any rights at all. Only humans and certain animals should. \n\nOrganizations should just be voluntary gatherings based on contract, any liability or profits would be assigned to the shareholders of it, end of story. \n\nCorporate personhood and bullshit like that should be abolished.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# 16) Business Structures\n\nAs detailed above, rights should not apply to organizations. Hence corporations should not exist. Not even LLC's should in fact. So business in a true Capitalist system would just be done in voluntary contract based arrangements or individually. \n\nA bunch of people being private contractors respective to one another, that is how an organization should work. \n\nThis Platonic bullshit of assigning attributes to non-existent concepts is just so wrong. We need to wake up and live in the real world, where only real beings exist, and fictional entities should have no rights.\n\nNow despite of this, there could still be arrangements to limit liability. Obviously people would want to limit their liability, especially in cases where they don't generate externalities. This could be done via insurance. Just pass on the liability to the insurer, and the insurer will quantify the costs and charge you proportionally to it.\n\nSo it's very likely that the economy would be made up by a web of private contractors, millions of small business arrangements, competing fiercely with one another, and offering the best kind of innovation possible. \n\nThis is the only form of true free market. Not fucking 5-6 corporations in an oligopoly, like we have now.\n\nI have been literally called a Communist for saying this, but these people don't realize that 5-6 corporations centrally planning the economy is very close to Stalinism.\n\nSo my proposal is a decentralized economy, where everyone has access to the free market.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n----------------\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is the only way I can imagine pure Capitalism to exist. Anything else is a centralized oligarchy, resembling Stalinism basically. In fact the current system we live in, especially here in Europe, is basically Leninism. Most utilities are monopolized by the government and big corporations tied heavily to the government, while only a few small businesses can exist and barely survive. We are heading towards Stalinism, where even the remaining small businesses will be eliminated.\n\nI find it ironic that a lot of people here are big business apologists, not realizing that they are advocating for Stalinism. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**I mean how is government + crony corporate control of the economy any different from literal Stalinism? Explain that to me.**\n\nLiberty is in the opposite direction dumbasses. An economy where everyone has access to the free market and setup their own business without any hinderance.","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"Capitalist Manifesto""num_comments":3,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Capitalist Manifesto"}

A lot of questions come up on the left\u2026 like is this the new face of America? Is this what is now comprised of our nation? Is it perhaps something more transcendent, something that crosses borders and religious affiliations? One of the most important questions that the left must ask is; does it have room for the new majority in this country? Does the traditional, hardcore conservative movements occurring in our churches, occurring in our families and occurring in society have a place among the movement? Does a straight white American male that has no shame in his birth, equipped with a full, healthy ego \u2013 does the left have nothing to offer him but resentment, disappointment and self-hatred? Or is there an exception to be made to the rules of this transcendent progressive message. No one culture is right or wrong, with the exception of that one, which is free to be mocked and derided. This brings us to the right. Everything is clear in the right. Cultures have their place. Nations are representative of their people and all people should be proud of who they are.

The black conservative Mormon female. The Sikh traditionalist.  These people are the clearest examples of the contradiction that makes up a human person. The fact that the right can so easily overlook the depth and wealth in individuals that their movement has produced can be infuriating. They often become poster-children without the intellectual right delving into the mind that makes them up. The left finds this depth infuriating. The right completely overlooks it.   \n \n\nWhere does a libertarian fit into this equation in 2018?

The cultures we value aren\u2019t solid and they\u2019re not spectrums of an amalgamous blend of an infinite number of slices\u2026 they\u2019re stories. Stories that an individual can either give power to, or can slowly strip away\u2026 it\u2019s not something that can be dismissed as easily as so many on the left wish it were possible to, but it\u2019s also not unchanging and unwavering that the right feels is biologically embedded in the human spirit. It\u2019s a process of growth that each individual, regardless of what warring tribe they find themselves aligned with has to slowly peel away so we can reach the understanding that we\u2019re not all the same, but we\u2019re definitely not the groups we find ourselves fatalistically born into: we\u2019re unique individuals.

If social assistance is stripped how would your average person (and below average person) afford school, medical, police assistance, affordable mass transit, and other publicly funded services?\n\nI understand the philosophy behind tax being theft, but I find there's an argument for global prosperity over a select few hoarding massive amounts of wealth while having an immeasurable advantage in maintaining their wealth while 99 percent of the global population lives below 30,000 dollars annually.\n\nWith wealth redistribution and a universal basic income imposed I feel like crime would be reduced, drug use would be reduced, overall happiness would be increased and as a society we would prosper much greater.\n\nIm not implying billionaires should lose all their money, but I have a hard time feeling empathetic for the people who have more wealth than most of the world combined losing a percentage of their wealth for the benefit of their fellow humans.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Questions from a liberal Canadian on taxes"}

{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1533357967,"num_comments":5,"score":1,"selftext":"Social Conflict Theory is a theory that suggests that the history of society lies on power struggles between a submissive social class and a dominant social class, as in which the submissive social class works to gain equal footing and potentially usurp the dominant class. Social Conflict Theory is a rather dominant theory in the field of Sociology and it was coined by Karl Marx.\n\nHow does Social Conflict Theory relate to racism, exactly? Karl Marx encouraged the working class (proletariat) to rise up against the capitalist rich class (bourgeoisie). That being said, racism pits one group of people against another. Social Media Outlets, whether they be Neo-Nazi-based or Neo-Marxist-based, rely on pitting the races against each other to garner support for their movements. Neo-Marxists might talk about the current oppression of minority groups such as African Americans while shunning majority groups such as Caucasian Americans. Likewise, Neo-Nazis might talk about the current oppression of majority groups such as Caucasian Americans while shunning minority groups like African Americans.\n\nWhat impact does this have, then? Racism in either direction is likely being used to fan the flames of Marxism. Considering Marxism has been an ideology that's lead to the death of potentially hundreds of millions, such an ideology needs to be combated. Not through violence, but rather, through cooperation. Both the majority and minority groups need to come together to oppose this ideology. We need to put aside our differences and our potential animosity towards each other. No more White versus Black, no more Japanese versus Chinese, no more poor versus rich. All races are being exploited by the Marxists. African Americans and Caucasian Americans alike are just cannon-fodder used to propel Marxism into the public sphere.

Children have received them in increasing doses from the hepatitis B shot on their day of  birth, in diphtheria-tetanus shots given repeatedly in their first six months of life and in pneumococcal, meningitis, HPV vaccines and more.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n*In at least seven different countries, patients with myalgic chronic fatigue syndrome have been described after they received one of these aluminum-containing vaccines.\u00a0In France in the late \u201990s, Gherardi began taking biopsies of the deltoid muscle of these patients and he discovered lesions in these \u2013 clumps of aggregated aluminium hydroxide  engulfed in white blood cells called macrophages \u2014 at the injection site.* ***Subsequent studies in mice found that\u00a0aluminum\u00a0in these cells slowly migrates to their brains where it seems to prefer to settle, permanently. He called\u00a0the phenomenon\u00a0Macrophagic Myofasciitis (MMF).\u201d***  \n \n\nContinuing on the subject of MMF, she explained that:\n\n&gt;***\u201cMMF mainly manifests as joint and muscle pain, fatigue and weakness, cognitive dysfunction, including attention and memory impairment and sleep disturbances.*** *And many MMF sufferers eventually  develop one of more than 100 different autoimmune disorders from alopecia to multiple sclerosis, sometimes years after the initial illness. So MMF is described as a facet of \u201cautoimmune\/inflammatory  syndrome induced by adjuvants\u201d (ASIA) identified by leading Israeli  immunologist Yehuda Shoenfeld in*\u00a02011*.\u201d*  \n \n\nShe stated:\n\n&gt;*\u201cBut the MMF picture is still developing. Another French researcher, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Authier, presented his group\u2019s findings published in the*\u00a0[**Journal of Nuclear Medicine**](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/m\/pubmed\/27765861\/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank)\u00a0*this  year showing that neuroimaging of MMF patients\u2019 brains by PET-scan reveals distinct patterns of impaired glucose metabolism in multiple  regions of their brains.*  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*New research presented by\u00a0Housam\u00a0Eidi\u00a0of the University of  British Columbia also looked at mouse brain function and aluminium (Al) concentration long after injections. Surprisingly,* ***the researchers found the lowest dose of Alhydrogel exerts the greatest neurotoxic effects. And small particle size seems to be critical for this brain  damage,\u00a0Eidi\u00a0explained\u201d***  \n \n\n## Toxic Amounts of Aluminum in Vaccinations\n\nDr. Robert Sears is another professional who is exceptionally worried  about the effect aluminum is having on our health. In his paper, titled  [**Is Aluminum The New Thimerosal?**](http:\/\/www.verontrustemoeders.nl\/Is%20Aluminum%20the%20New%20Thimerosal.pdf), Dr. Sears explained that aluminum is added to vaccinations to help them work more efficiently.\n\nDuring his research, he came across a number of extremely worrying  documents, including one written by the American Society for Parenteral  and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN). Describing the document in depth, Sears  wrote:\n\n&gt;*\u201cThe source of the daily limit of 4 to 5 mcg of aluminum per kilogram of body weight quoted by the ASPEN statement seems to be a study that compared the neurologic development of about 100 premature babies who were fed a standard IV solution that contained aluminum, with the development of 100 premature babies who were fed the same solution with almost all aluminum filtered out.* ***The study was prompted by a number of established facts: that injected aluminum can build up to toxic levels in the bloodstream, bones, and brain; that preemies have decreased kidney function and thus a higher risk of toxicity; that an autopsy performed on one preemie whose sudden death was otherwise unexplained revealed high aluminum concentrations in the brain; and that aluminum toxicity can cause progressive dementia.\u201d***  \n \n\nHe continued:\n\n&gt;***\u201cHowever, none of these documents or studies mentions vaccines; they look only at IV solutions and injectable medications****.* ***Nor does the FDA require labels on vaccines warning about the dangers of aluminum toxicity, although such labels are required for all other injectable medications. All of these studies and label warnings seem to apply mainly to premature babies and kidney patients. What about larger, full-term babies with healthy kidneys?\u201d***  \n \n\nHe explained:\n\n&gt;*\u201cHowever, these documents don\u2019t tell us what the maximum safe dose would be for a healthy baby or child, and I can\u2019t find such  information anywhere. This is probably why the ASPEN group suggests, and  the FDA requires, that all injectable solutions be limited to* ***25 mcg****;  we at least know that that level is safe.\u201d*  \n \n\nIf this information is correct, then why do so many of the  recommended childhood vaccinations include far above the recommended  amounts of aluminum?  \n \n\n\tAccording to Dr. Sears, the levels of aluminum included in childhood vaccinations are as follows:\n\n\u2022 [**DTaP**](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/blog\/pincushion-pregnancy-new-data-dtap-vaccine) (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis): **170\u2013625 mcg**, depending on  \n \tmanufacturer\n\n\u2022 hepatitis A: **250 mcg**\n\n\u2022 hepatitis B: **250 mcg**\n\n\u2022 Hib (for meningitis; PedVaxHib brand only): **225 mcg**\n\n\u2022 HPV: **225 mcg**\n\n\u2022 Pediarix (DTaP\u2013hepatitis B\u2013polio combination): **850 mcg**\n\n\u2022 Pentacel (DTaP\u2013Hib\u2013polio combination): **330 mcg**\n\n\u2022 pneumococcus: **125 mcg** (emphasis added)\n\nThese levels far exceed the safe levels recommended by ASPEN,  especially when you consider that a newborn baby is vaccinated with the  hepatitis B vaccine, containing 250 mcg of aluminum, at birth!\n\nIn fact, according to [**Dr. Sears**](https:\/\/sarahjmuma.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/05\/aluminum-new-thimerosal-sears.pdf), the FDA stated that:\n\n&gt;***\u201cAlthough aluminum toxicity is not commonly detected clinically, it can be serious in selected patient populations, such as neonates (newborns), and may be more common than is recognized.\u201d*** (emphasis added)  \n \n\nSince his paper, which was written in 2008, there are even more vaccinations containing aluminum.\n\n## Terrifying Neurodegenerative Plague Expected to Affect One in Two Americans\n\nAccording to Ms. McGovern, no one can say how many of the one to four  million Americans and millions more globally are suffering from serious  chronic fatigue due to aluminum poisoning.\u00a0\n\nShe continued with the following statement:\n\n&gt;*\u201cNo one can say how many of the current 50 million cases of  autoimmune disease in America are a long-term fallout from shots taken  years ago.*  \n*Terrifying as that is, there were two more days of this research presented. \u00a0A 2017 study in the*\u00a0[***Journal of Translational Medicine***](http:\/\/translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com\/)\u00a0*from Exley\u2019s lab demonstrated the presence of some of the highest contents of aluminum ever observed in brain\u00a0tissue in every section of tissue sampled from brains of patients with familial early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease. So, could it be that when aluminum migrates from vaccines to brains it is somehow associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the terrifying neurodegenerative plague that is expected to affect one in two Americans by 2050?*  \n \n\n[More Reading](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/blog\/epidemic-sudden-infant-deaths-medically-induced-syndrome-1)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Vaccine Induced Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Caused by Aluminum Poisoning"}

Is it a coincidence they also happen to be very cautious regarding vaccines?***\u00a0\n\nEdited from [**here**](https:\/\/vactruth.com\/2016\/06\/23\/japanese-government-bans-mmr-vaccine\/)**.**\u00a0\n\n**The Japanese government banned the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine from its vaccination program in 1993, after a record number of children developed adverse reactions, including meningitis, loss of limbs, and death.** \\[1\\]\n\n## The MMR Vaccine\u2019s Tragic History in Japan\n\nThe MMR vaccine was introduced in Japan in April 1989, and parents who refused the compulsory vaccine were fined. After three months of analysis, officials realized that one in 900 children developed adverse reactions to the vaccine, **a rate that was 2,000 times higher than the expected rate.**\n\nFour years later, in 1993, the government removed the MMR mandate against measles and rubella. A doctor from Japan\u2019s Ministry of Health and Welfare admitted that the separate, individual doses of measles and rubella cost twice as much to administer, and he defended the decision, stating, \u201cbut we believe it is worth it.\u201d Furthermore, a member of the health ministry also stated that **the ban has not caused an increase in deaths from measles.** \\[2\\]\n\nJapanese officials were also concerned about the MMR vaccine causing additional cases of mumps, citing numerous studies in\u00a0*The Lancet*. \\[3\\]\n\n# What Many Parents Don\u2019t Know About the MMR Vaccine\n\nThe list of adverse reactions to the MMR vaccine, straight from Merck\u2019s vaccine package inserts, is long and alarming. A shortened version of the vaccine damage associated with the MMR vaccine includes-\n\n* Vomiting\n* Diarrhea\n* [**Anaphylaxis**](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/disease\/anaphylaxis)\n* Nerve deafness\n* [**Diabetes**](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/disease\/diabetes-mellitus-type-2)\n* Arthritis\n* Myalgia\n* Encephalitis\n* Febrile seizures\n* Pneumonia, and \n* Death. \\[4, 5\\]\n\nA search of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database shows the following statistics **from the United States: over 75,000 adverse events have been reported from any combination of  measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines, including, most notably:**\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **78 deaths**\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 85 cases of deafness\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 48 cases of decreased eye contact\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 92 cases of developmental delay\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 855 reported cases of autism\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **116 cases of intellectual disability**\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 401 reports of speech disorders\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 276 reports of loss of consciousness\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 143 cases of encephalitis\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 74 cases of meningitis\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 **111 cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome**\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 692 cases of gait disturbance (not being able to walk normally)\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 748 cases of hypokinesia (partial or complete loss of muscle movement)\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 653 reports of hypotonia (poor muscle tone)\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4874 reports of seizures, including febrile convulsions and tonic clonic seizures\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1576 cases of cellulitis (a potentially serious skin infection)\n\nAnd finally, in some cases, the vaccine has caused the very diseases  it is supposed to prevent, with the following data reported to VAERS:\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 147 cases of measles\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 384 cases of mumps\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 29 cases of rubella \\[6\\]\n\nThe number of adverse events following vaccination are vastly underreported, as acknowledged by the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC). The National Vaccine Information Center estimates that less than one to ten percent of adverse reactions to vaccines are reported. Many of the numbers reported above could therefore be multiplied by one hundred to determine a more accurate amount of adverse  reactions. \\[7, 8\\]\n\n#### Japanese Officials Speak Out\n\nJapan has been criticized for being behind the times when it comes to  vaccination. Vaccine advocates claim that Japan has not kept pace with other developed countries regarding the use of vaccines. **Despite listing 110 infectious diseases in a government registry, Japan offers vaccines for only 22 of those.**\n\nSome Japanese health experts disagree, however. Hiroko Mori, a vaccine researcher, is one of those experts. He was the former head of the infectious disease division at Japan\u2019s National Institute of Public  Health.\n\nHe has noted that **Japan has one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world and has advocated for fewer vaccines, stating that the country\u2019s excellent sanitation and nutrition has boosted children\u2019s health.**\n\nHe observed,\n\n# \u201cMedicine is supposed to be about healing, but babies who cannot speak are being given unnecessary shots because parents are scared. Children are losing their ability to heal naturally.\n\n# There are so many people who have suffered side effects. All we  are asking is to establish the right to say \u2018no.\u2019 The right to choose should be recognized as a fundamental human right.\u201d \n\nTetsuo Nakayama, Dean of Kitasato University\u2019s Graduate School of Infection Control Sciences, is an expert who supports vaccines, but he, too, acknowledges the risks of vaccination, stating that:\n\n&gt;***\u201cThere is no guarantee that your child will not be that one out of 1,000. You have to compare the risks between the side effects and what will happen if you are infected with the disease naturally.***  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n***Under the existing law, the decision to vaccinate your child or not is basically left up to the parents, but there is not enough information out there for them to make an informed decision.\u201d***  \n \n\nMasako Koga, a former representative of the Consumers Union of Japan, has shared his concerns about the ulterior motives behind mass vaccination programs:\n\n&gt;***\u201cVaccines should only be given to those who need them but that is not happening. The global industry is being driven by a strategy that promotes VPD***\u00a0**\\[vaccine preventable diseases\\]*****.***  \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***We must put a stop to it. Vaccines have close ties to money.  From development to circulation to research on side effects, there are a lot of vested interests involved.\u201d***  \n \n\nHe also summarized what motivates many parents\u2019 decisions not to vaccinate their children:\n\n&gt;***\u201cThere is no knowing who will suffer side effects as a result of vaccination.***  \n **\\[Proponents of vaccination\\]**\u00a0***say the chance of suffering a side effect is 1 in a million. For parents, however, that one is everything.\u201d***  \n \n\n#### Conclusion\n\n**Japanese officials have made decisions that value the health and  safety of their citizens when they have removed vaccines with dangerous side effects from their national vaccination program.**\n\n**Japan boasts a low infant mortality rate, despite \u2014 or perhaps  because of \u00a0\u2014 mandating only a fraction of the vaccines required by other developed countries, including the United States.**\n\n**If you wish to learn more about the harmful ingredients in vaccines or the potential adverse reactions, we have compiled an easy-to-navigate list of vaccine package inserts from the manufacturers that you can**\u00a0[**view or download here**](https:\/\/vactruth.com\/vaccine-inserts\/).\n\n**References:**\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [**www.dailymail.co.uk\/health\/article-17509\/Why-Japan-banned-MMR-vaccine.html**](http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/health\/article-17509\/Why-Japan-banned-MMR-vaccine.html)\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [**http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/asia-pacific\/1808316.stm**](http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/asia-pacific\/1808316.stm)\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [**http:\/\/www.healthy.net\/Health\/Article\/UPDATES\/7591**](http:\/\/www.healthy.net\/Health\/Article\/UPDATES\/7591)\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [**http:\/\/www.merck.com\/product\/usa\/pi\\_circulars\/m\/mmr\\_ii\/mmr\\_ii\\_pi.pdf**](http:\/\/www.merck.com\/product\/usa\/pi_circulars\/m\/mmr_ii\/mmr_ii_pi.pdf)\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [**http:\/\/www.merck.com\/product\/usa\/pi\\_circulars\u2026pdf**](http:\/\/www.merck.com\/product\/usa\/pi_circulars\/p\/proquad\/proquad_pi.pdf)\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 [**https:\/\/vaers.hhs.gov\/data\/data**](https:\/\/vaers.hhs.gov\/data\/data)\n\n7.

{"author":"Smigelski-78","created_utc":1533499145,"num_comments":13,"score":28,"selftext":"I ran for office (and so can you) \u2013 AMA\n\nMy name is Andrew Smigelski. This year, from January to May, I ran as a candidate for State Representative in Ohio in the Republican primary. I ran on a platform of legalizing marijuana and reaping its economic benefits, ending the war on drugs, legalizing alternative addiction treatments (Ohio is one of the worst states for the \u201copioid crisis\u201d), and cutting taxes and spending.  \n\nI lost to the career politician incumbent, unfortunately by quite a large margin, but I was still able to learn about the process and spread libertarian ideas.  \n\nIf you, like me, are tired of the lack of libertarian candidates and under-representation of libertarian ideals, you should consider running for office.  \n\nI\u2019m happy to answer any questions you have, from broad ideas, to specific details. I\u2019d like to be the resource that I didn\u2019t have.\n\nFirst an overview of the process:\n\n**1.**  I had to get a copy of the candidate filing petition from my State\u2019s Secretary of State website here:\n\n[https:\/\/www.sos.state.oh.us\/elections\/elections-officials\/forms-petitions\/](https:\/\/www.sos.state.oh.us\/elections\/elections-officials\/forms-petitions\/)\n\nThe specific form I needed was called \u201c[Declaration of Candidacy - Party Primary   District Office - State Senator or  State Representative (PDF)](https:\/\/www.sos.state.oh.us\/globalassets\/elections\/forms\/2-f.pdf).\u201d If you\u2019re running as a Libertarian or independent in a general election, you\u2019d need the Minor Party nominating petition or a non-partisan nomination petition.\n\nI needed 50 valid signatures for my petition, and since I was running in the Republican primary, they all had to be from registered Republicans. In total I gathered 99 signatures, 89 of which were validated.  \n\nI was able to find Republican households by using a copy of the County Voter list, found on the county board of elections website. Most of the counties in the district made this pretty easy by letting me generate Voter Lists\/Reports by party. I used the \u201cPrecinct, Walking List\u201d option so that the addresses would be sorted by location. Here\u2019s the Hocking County Voter List Generator so you can try it yourself:\n\n[https:\/\/www.voterfind.com\/hockingoh\/vtrreport.aspx](https:\/\/www.voterfind.com\/hockingoh\/vtrreport.aspx)\n\nOne county (out of 6) in my district didn\u2019t have Voter Lists available on their website, so I had to call them and request it be e-mailed. It was pretty straight forward. If you can\u2019t find yours, don\u2019t be afraid to call.\n\n**2.** I had to file for campaign finance. If you\u2019re running in a local election, you may not have to do this. If you\u2019re running in a federal election, you\u2019ll have to file with the FEC (which I didn\u2019t have to do.)\n\nFor Ohio, I went back to the Secretary of State website and found the Campaign Finance page here:\n\n[https:\/\/www.sos.state.oh.us\/campaign-finance\/](https:\/\/www.sos.state.oh.us\/campaign-finance\/)\n\nI read through the entire \u201cCampaign Finance Handbook.\u201d Not all of it was relevant to my race, but I wanted to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything. I found out that I had to file an \u201cElectronic Filing Registration\u201d, \u201cWaiver of Declaration of Filing Day Finances\u201d, and a \u201cDesignation of Treasurer.\u201d\n\nI was allowed to designate myself treasurer of my campaign, so that\u2019s what I did.  \n\nI printed these completed forms and turned them in to the Board of Elections at the same time that I filed my candidate petitions.  \n\nIf you\u2019re not 100% sure which forms you need, or which Board of Elections you need to file with (it may not be your home county), don\u2019t hesitate to give them a call.\n\nThose were the two main steps to start the campaign. Once it was started, I also had to file a financial disclosure to my State\u2019s \u201cJoint Legislative Ethics Committee.\u201d If you have to do something similar, you\u2019ll probably be notified by mail.\n\nYou can find some information about my policies and positions on the following questionnaires I answered for the local newspapers. Feel free to borrow any wording or ideas!\n\nr\/https:\/\/www.lancastereaglegazette.com\/story\/news\/politics\/elections\/2018\/04\/20\/voter-info-republican-candidates-ohio-house-87th-district\/525643002\/\n\n[http:\/\/c3.thevoterguide.org\/v\/columbus18\/race-detail.do?id=15794783](http:\/\/c3.thevoterguide.org\/v\/columbus18\/race-detail.do?id=15794783)\n\nSo that\u2019s a basic overview of everything. Feel free to AMA about running for office, my policies\/positions, libertarianism, or anything else that\u2019s on your mind. I\u2019ll try to answer everyone, even those reading this months from now. I\u2019d love to see more libertarians on the ballot!","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I Ran For Office (And so can you) - AMA"}

I think every child has some kind of gift in it, some kind of talent and creativity that they could use to create something nice for the world, but that gift is slowly eroded, as the minds of kids are slowly poisoned over the years in the education system. You send in creative innocent kids, and on the other end, dull, hopeless and apathetic sad adults come out. It's just so sad and I can't believe nobody is bothered by it. I am soon to become a parent so I am very concerned about this, but the other parents just don't care at all.\n\nA lot of you Americans are lucky that you have the option to at least homeschool, I don't know to what degree, but you have that freedom, at least for now. Here in Europe, you have no freedom at all, as a parent.\n\nIt used to be 4 years of compulsory education when it was enacted largely in the 2nd part of the 19 century, then raised to 8 years at around the early 1900's, then raised to 10 and 12 post WW2. Now you are forced to kindergarten at 3, and in some countries you are forced into the education system until 19.\n\nYou are a literal child slave in the government education system. I remember my childhood exactly and I always hated school. I always felt like a prisoner, and nobody around me felt the same way. Just waking up every day and going to school, I always felt like a prisoner, and couldn't make sense of it why this was happening to me, to a small child? I have asked my parents, and they always said the usual \"oh you must go to school to be succesful\" or some other parrotted nonsense, but some reason I could see through the bullshit, that other kids couldn't, and I knew exactly how bad it was, I hated every second of it.\n\n\nYour first day in school, the very first lesson you learn, is to shut up. That's right, you should shut up, and obey authority, that is the first thing that the teachers teach you. The teacher is your God, they know everything better than you, you are not allowed to question him, not allowed to talk back. Just sit in the rusty bench and listen while you are brainwashed for 16 years.\n\nOf course the curriculum is bullshit too:\n\n* Literature, history, arts... is just nationalistic government propaganda written by the victors, not objective factual analysis of what happened (which history should be) or how people felt at the time (which arts and literature should be).\n\n* And even 60-70% of modern science can be completely bullshit [[1]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/worldnews\/comments\/90mnb4\/400000_scientists_all_over_the_world_have_been\/)[[2]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/conspiracy\/comments\/66dmpf\/nearly_all_scientific_papers_controlled_by_same\/)[[3]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/conspiracy\/comments\/4lvx38\/as_a_skeptic_this_alarms_me_editors_in_chief_of\/)\n\nYet you are force-fed this garbage, redardless of if it's accurate or not. Remember most scientific theories are just theories, in 100-200 years we might find better and more accurate ones and look back at the current time as we now look back at cavemen.\n\nI have literally experienced a situation, where we had outdated manuals, I think in physics, and there was a lesson I think about the reflection of light or something around that, and the teacher used some old outdated formula, and then one of our colleagues had corrected him, saying that he looked it up and found a new updated one, but the teacher insisted that we should use the old one, despite being outdated, just because that is the curriculum. \"And you should not question me again or I will fail you, you little shit!\" was kind of like his attitude.\n\nSo it's not about learning, and it's certainly not about the truth, it's about blind obedience to authority.\n\nFurthermore as you can see the accuracy or veracity of the lessons don't matter. All that matters is that you are fed nonsense long enough, to make you a passive obedient slave, that will get used to go to work a 9-5 job and pay his taxes.\n\nThat is what the school system is for, prepare you to be a slave for the rest of your life.\n\nAnd then let's not even get into the techniques that the teachers use. First of all they are leeches. They leech off taxpayer money, they get tons of benefits, tons of free vacations, high salaries, and are almost impossible to fire.\n\nI have been beaten and literally tortured by teachers while I was a kid. I was also put to forced labor. So my school had literally violated human rights at least 3-4 times that I can just remember.\n\nThese leftists always talk about \"muh child labor laws\", in order to keep kids out of the market and shoving them back to school, but what about this. What about when I was beaten as a small child by the teacher because I was late like 10 minutes to the class? What about when the teachers punitively forced me and some of my colleagues to clean up an entire floor as detention?\n\nDoesn't that classify as violation of human rights? I think it does, but nobody gives a shit about it. \n\nNow they say that they don't do that anymore (I would take that with an ounce of salt), and yes this was a few decades ago, so I can't know for sure. But I grew up in those times so that is all I know. If any one of you is to send their kids to a school, watch out for these evil things.\n\n\nIt's just horrible that no parent cares about this. They say, you ought to go to school, because everyone does. Well that is like the same argument for slavery: all brown people are slaves, therefore this is the norm, you should not question it.\n\n\nIf you are a parent with a school age kid or soon to be,  I beg you, if you have the option to go for homeschooling, do it. Don't subject your kid to this kind of abuse and imprisonment. It will make your child a numb obedient slave like 99% of the population. If you want your kid to become a creative, innovative, and influential person, then either go for a reputable private school, or homeschool.\n\nI have been shopping around in private schools, and chosen one already, a very reputable one. I won't send my child to government child prisons.\n\nFuck you authoritarian fucks that support and enable this level of abuse against children, including the indifferent or ignorant parents, you are no better than the Nazis.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Mandatory Schools"}

You send in creative innocent kids, and on the other end, dull, hopeless and apathetic sad adults come out. It's just so sad and I can't believe nobody is bothered by it. I am soon to become a parent so I am very concerned about this, but the other parents just don't care at all.\n\nA lot of you Americans are lucky that you have the option to at least homeschool, I don't know to what degree, but you have that freedom, at least for now. Here in Europe, you have no freedom at all, as a parent.\n\nIt used to be 4 years of compulsory education when it was enacted largely in the 2nd part of the 19 century, then raised to 8 years at around the early 1900's, then raised to 10 and 12 post WW2. Now you are forced to kindergarten at 3, and in some countries you are forced into the education system until 19.\n\nYou are a literal child slave in the government education system. I remember my childhood exactly and I always hated school. I always felt like a prisoner, and nobody around me felt the same way. Just waking up every day and going to school, I always felt like a prisoner, and couldn't make sense of it why this was happening to me, to a small child? I have asked my parents, and they always said the usual \"oh you must go to school to be succesful\" or some other parrotted nonsense, but some reason I could see through the bullshit, that other kids couldn't, and I knew exactly how bad it was, I hated every second of it.\n\n\nYour first day in school, the very first lesson you learn, is to shut up. That's right, you should shut up, and obey authority, that is the first thing that the teachers teach you. The teacher is your God, they know everything better than you, you are not allowed to question him, not allowed to talk back. Just sit in the rusty bench and listen while you are brainwashed for 16 years.\n\nOf course the curriculum is bullshit too:\n\n* Literature, history, arts... is just nationalistic government propaganda written by the victors, not objective factual analysis of what happened (which history should be) or how people felt at the time (which arts and literature should be).\n\n* And even 60-70% of modern science can be completely bullshit [[1]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/worldnews\/comments\/90mnb4\/400000_scientists_all_over_the_world_have_been\/)[[2]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/conspiracy\/comments\/66dmpf\/nearly_all_scientific_papers_controlled_by_same\/)[[3]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/conspiracy\/comments\/4lvx38\/as_a_skeptic_this_alarms_me_editors_in_chief_of\/)\n\nYet you are force-fed this garbage, redardless of if it's accurate or not. Remember most scientific theories are just theories, in 100-200 years we might find better and more accurate ones and look back at the current time as we now look back at cavemen.\n\nI have literally experienced a situation, where we had outdated manuals, I think in physics, and there was a lesson I think about the reflection of light or something around that, and the teacher used some old outdated formula, and then one of our colleagues had corrected him, saying that he looked it up and found a new updated one, but the teacher insisted that we should use the old one, despite being outdated, just because that is the curriculum. \"And you should not question me again or I will fail you, you little shit!\" was kind of like his attitude.\n\nSo it's not about learning, and it's certainly not about the truth, it's about blind obedience to authority.\n\nFurthermore as you can see the accuracy or veracity of the lessons don't matter. All that matters is that you are fed nonsense long enough, to make you a passive obedient slave, that will get used to go to work a 9-5 job and pay his taxes.\n\nThat is what the school system is for, prepare you to be a slave for the rest of your life.\n\nAnd then let's not even get into the techniques that the teachers use. First of all they are leeches. They leech off taxpayer money, they get tons of benefits, tons of free vacations, high salaries, and are almost impossible to fire.\n\nI have been beaten and literally tortured by teachers while I was a kid. I was also put to forced labor. So my school had literally violated human rights at least 3-4 times that I can just remember.\n\nThese leftists always talk about \"muh child labor laws\", in order to keep kids out of the market and shoving them back to school, but what about this. What about when I was beaten as a small child by the teacher because I was late like 10 minutes to the class? What about when the teachers punitively forced me and some of my colleagues to clean up an entire floor as detention?\n\nDoesn't that classify as violation of human rights? I think it does, but nobody gives a shit about it. \n\nNow they say that they don't do that anymore (I would take that with an ounce of salt), and yes this was a few decades ago, so I can't know for sure. But I grew up in those times so that is all I know. If any one of you is to send their kids to a school, watch out for these evil things.\n\n\nIt's just horrible that no parent cares about this. They say, you ought to go to school, because everyone does. Well that is like the same argument for slavery: all brown people are slaves, therefore this is the norm, you should not question it.\n\n\nIf you are a parent with a school age kid or soon to be,  I beg you, if you have the option to go for homeschooling, do it. Don't subject your kid to this kind of abuse and imprisonment. It will make your child a numb obedient slave like 99% of the population. If you want your kid to become a creative, innovative, and influential person, then either go for a reputable private school, or homeschool.\n\nI have been shopping around in private schools, and chosen one already, a very reputable one. I won't send my child to government child prisons.\n\nFuck you authoritarian fucks that support and enable this level of abuse against children, including the indifferent or ignorant parents, you are no better than the Nazis.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Mandatory Schools""num_comments":0,"score":3,"selftext":"","subreddit":"LibertarianEurope","title":"Mandatory Schools"}

{"author":"gecko_burger_15","created_utc":1533575612,"num_comments":12,"score":0,"selftext":"I am not a libertarian, but do have a question for libertarians. \n\nLet me just agree, for the sake of argument, that if we adopted libertarian\/small government values in the 1980s that the US would have been better off. My question is, if small government would have been better for the US in 1980, do you think that small government values will be better for the US in 2020 and in 2060?\n\nBefore answering my question, let me provide some context. In 2016 we had 9.8 million Federal employees [source](https:\/\/fcw.com\/articles\/2017\/10\/05\/federal-workforce-volker-size.aspx). That number includes federal employees, contractors, grant employees, active-duty military, and postal carriers. In 2014 we had about 7.4 million full-time equivalent (FTE) workers [source](http:\/\/www.governing.com\/gov-data\/public-workforce-salaries\/states-most-government-workers-public-employees-by-job-type.html). In January 2018 the total US labor force was about 161 million [source](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Labor_force_in_the_United_States).\n\nSo let us estimate that in 2020 the US workforce will include about 160 million total workers and about 16 million (or 10%) of that will be government employees of some sort. If you want to quibble about the estimate, that is fine. But unless someone has information that my numbers are WAY off, let\u2019s just use those as decent estimates for 2020.\n\nI imagine that libertarians would be happy to reduce the government workforce by at least 50% (or 8 million). If that is not a view shared by many libertarians (or libertarians on this sub) please let me know. So small government means fewer government employees. However, if 8 million people lose their jobs, that will cause two things: first, the number of unemployed individuals will skyrocket and second, wages (as adjusted for inflation) will go down as the economy adjusts to the oversupply of labor. Note, that once wages go down, unemployment will also return to typical levels. I don\u2019t think any of this is controversial. That is just how wages and unemployment work.\n\nBecause of robots, computers, and AI, it is quite possible that the US economy in 2060 might require only 40 million people and yet we STILL we might have 3% growth in GDP with that small number of people employed. You can quibble with my estimate. It might be 80 million. It might be 20 million. The point is, everything we have seen from past trends indicates that robots, computers, and AI, are all allowing the US economy (and the world economy for that matter) to generate a given amount of wealth with fewer and fewer laborers. That is the clear direction the world is headed, regardless of the specific estimate you have for the size of the required US workforce in 2060. If you are not convinced about increasing labor efficiency, see * at bottom of this post.\n\nFor sake of argument, I concede that small government policy (as opposed to big government policy) from 1776 to 1980 would have benefitted the economy. But what are your thoughts on the future? Do you think that corporations will continue to create value in ever more labor-efficient ways (as has been the trend)? How will the people who are not needed for labor pay for food? How will they pay for lodging and clothing? \n\nWhat I am asking for is the collective opinion on this sub of the future of small government philosophy. Do you think that small government policy has and always will have the same advantages over big government policy? Do you think that small government policy will be less beneficial in the future than it has been in the past? Or don\u2019t you believe that organizations will continue to require less labor for the same amount of economic output? Do you believe that we will reach a point that we will have very, very low demand for labor, yet mass poverty and starvation will be averted via a non-governmental process? If so, what process do you expect to take care of that problem?\n\n*If you go to [this site](https:\/\/data.bls.gov\/pdq\/SurveyOutputServlet) and then select data from 1980 to the present (see the drop down menu for dates) you will find that in we had 19 million people in manufacturing in 1980 (total US population in 1980 was 227 million). In contrast, during the final year of Obama\u2019s presidency we had about 12 million people employed in manufacturing (total US population in 2015 was 321 million). Now you might think that manufacturing output has gone down (jobs taken by China and all that). However, manufacturing output (in inflation adjusted dollars) has gone up from 1980 to the present. You can read more about manufacturing output vs. laborers in manufacturing [here](http:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2017\/07\/25\/most-americans-unaware-that-as-u-s-manufacturing-jobs-have-disappeared-output-has-grown\/)\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Small government past, present, and (most importantly) future"}

Are there libertarian democrats in Oregon and Colorado that we could coalesce with? How do you view tea party republicans?\n\nI personally think that libertarians have a lot of untapped potential on the left.

We know they have liberal bias... but are mad because we rely on them for content. So does CNN and I don't care, I just don't watch.

New Jersey reports 1 in 34 children, and about 5 percent of Eight-Year-Old boys affected as of 2014.(10) If this rate continues, half of all children born in 2025 will be autistic according to Stephanie Seneff PhD.(11)***\u00a0\n\n**What is Causing the Epidemic?**\n\nOur government health agencies, academic medicine and public health  institutions have been silent on this question of what is causing the [**autism**](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/disease\/autism-spectrum-disorders) epidemic. They merely shrug their shoulders and say *\"we don\u2019t know\"*, quickly adding, *\"It is certainly not vaccines\"*.\n\n**It IS The Vaccines \u2013\u00a0Aluminum Adjuvants in Vaccines Cause Autism**\n\nWe now have 5 years of medical research, mostly from outside the United States, incriminating [**aluminum**](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/toxic-ingredient\/aluminum) adjuvants in vaccines as the SOLE cause of autism epidemic. JB Handley does a nice job laying out the argument and summarizing this  research.(3) He uses the web site, Vaccine Papers, as a good source for the documentation.(4) Many others have raised the red flag on aluminum adjuvants.(1-2)(31)\n\n**Very High Aluminum Levels in Autistic Brains**\n\nRevelations  about aluminum neuro-toxicity have been made even more urgent by the  findings of Dr Christpher Exley who found extremely high aluminum  content in post mortem brains of autistic individuals. (5-8)\u00a0 \n\n# [IMAGE](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/sites\/default\/files\/ckeditor\/blank.justin\/images\/Aluminium_wikimedia-commons.jpg)\n\n**Plausible Mechanism Has Been Discovered**\n\nAluminum at the vaccine injection site is taken up by macrophages which travel to the brain causing micro-glial activation, [**inflammation**](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/disease\/inflammation) and immune activation with increased IL-6 cytokine levels, and impaired neuro development, leading to many of the symptoms of autism in animal models.(12-30)\n\n**Studies on Aluminum Adjuvant Safety \u2013 Using Aluminum in the Placebo**\n\nThe \"authorities\" have told us repeatedly that vaccines are safe, and the science is settled. You might then ask the obvious question, \n\n# \"Where is the data on studies showing the safety of vaccine aluminum adjuvants\"? \n\nThe correct answer is: ***\"There are no suitable safety studies*****.*****\"*****(**16) The FDA merely\u00a0**ASSUMED**\u00a0aluminum [**adjuvants**](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/toxic-ingredient\/vaccine-adjuvants)  to be safe. It appears the FDA is very good at assuming things. \n\nAnother outrageous gimmick is the use of aluminum adjuvants in the placebos  used in trials for FDA approval. (24-25) In these studies, half the patients are injected with the vaccine and the other half are injected with [**placebo**](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/therapeutic-action\/placebo-effect), and the number of adverse reactions are reported. A placebo should  contain inert sugar water, not an immunotoxic aluminum adjuvant. This simple ploy allows the immunotoxicity of the aluminum adjuvant to be  ignored.(24-25)\n\n# [IMAGE](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/sites\/default\/files\/ckeditor\/blank.justin\/images\/autoimmune_disease_rising_incidence_jeffrey_dach_md_figure1.jpg)\n\n**Aluminum Adjuvants and the Autoimmune Epidemic**\n\nBased on published data in the medical literature, rates of auto-immune  diseases are increasing at epidemic proportions.(36)\u00a0See above image showing increase incidence of various auto-immune diseases, Courtesy of Bach, 2002 (37) Although the exact cause is speculative, many authors have implicated aluminum adjuvants in vaccines. (31-35) One such author is Yehuda Shoenfeld MD, who says in a July 2017 editorial in IMAJ:(33)\n\n&gt;***Adjuvants stimulate the immune system, and therefore lead to more effective immune reactions\u2026Despite the benefits of adjuvant use in vaccination,  such additives can induce non-specific constitutional musculoskeletal or neurological clinical manifestations, and in certain cases can lead to the appearance or acceleration of an autoimmune disease in a patient with a genetic susceptibility \\[9\\]. \u2026The induction of autoimmune diseases by adjuvants was also reported in animal models\u2026The interaction between the adjuvant material and genetic predisposition may lead to the  development of autoimmune diseases as well as lymphoproliferative  disorders. (33)***  \n \n\n**Conclusion:**\u00a0Recent medical research makes a strong case for neuro-toxicity of aluminum adjuvants as the cause of our autism epidemic. Adjuvants have also been implicated in increasing rates of [**auto-immune diseases**](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/disease\/autoimmune-diseases).  The din of silence in the media has been quite remarkable. Nothing will change unless you get involved and bring about change. Print out this article and send it to all your friends, congressmen, doctors, and  family members.

It's not a very common viewpoint but I'm bringing it up here for the discussion.\n\nThose are private companies and they're entitled to doing whatever they want. Although the fact that it all came at once is quite surprising, I still respect their freedom to manage their services however they see fit. My problem is how vague they're in their description. So far not a single clear example of hate speech was cited by those companies, none that I'm aware of at least. Even the people who bring up things he said mainly show just opinions. I do find Alex batshit crazy, but that's not a reason to call what he says \"hate speech\". \n\nThe bigger picture is the dominance of such platforms who seem to go uncontested. People complain about Twitter but they don't move to Gab or Mastodon. They complain about Facebook and YouTube but they didn't support any alternative and many of those who challenged YouTube didn't get quite the audience to have an impact.\n\nBasically my point is: companies are free to do whatever they want on their platforms, but we, the users, need to support the alternatives to deter such powers being abused in fear of losing customers to competitors.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Thoughts on the Alex Jones situation"}

I still lean towards making immigration open, but I also think restricting immigration by law but doing nothing about it is the best option. Illegal immigrants contribute to the economy. However, if they were to come in at a fast enough rate and given citizenship, they could potentially over-burden the NIT. That being said, give immigrants that come in through the quota a 10 year naturalization period with NIT in their future, but give ones that come in regardless of the quota a 10 year naturalization period, given that they never receive the benefits of the NIT. Also, no deporting or arresting for immigration either, though I hope what I said above implied that.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Can Open Borders Be Reconciled with a Negative Income Tax"}

But most 'mainstream' sources say they are 'safe and effective' to the point where anyone who questions that, is a crazy person. \n\nBut when we go deeper concerns arise.\n\nWe  know that thousands of cases have been proven in court,[ damages paid of  over $3 Billion](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/VaccinesCause\/comments\/8vmstf\/the_vaccine_injury_compensation_program_vicp_has\/), and many thousands of cases of adverse reactions being reported (that is only in the US with about 4% of the global population)... **safety** seems to be extremely subjective.\n\nSome data points:\n\n1.Prior  to the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, Vaccine  Manufacturers were being successfully sued for damages caused by their  products.

Clearly there was a problem with the DTP Vaccine.\n\nInstead  of fixing the problem with the DTP Vaccine shielding manufacturers from liability resulted in the increased use of  DTP, and then DTaP, (acellular pertussis) plus adult TDaP vaccine from 1 dose in 1960 and 5 doses in 1983 to 7 doses by the age of 18 in 2016 \u2013 not including the  \u201cevery 10 years\u201d adult boosters and pregnancy doses.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Did you know Vaccine Manufacturers are not Liable for Vaccines that Hurt People?"}

{"author":"twistedmethod","created_utc":1533672779,"num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"\" Like many Europeans, I am amazed that American conservatives defend almost unanimously the capitalist system whose expansion methodically keeps destroying everything they want to conserve. Despite the structural crisis of the capitalist system over the last couple of years, American conservatives continue with their celebration of capitalism as the only system that purportedly respects and guarantees individual liberty, private property and free trade. They believe in the intrinsic virtues of the market whose mechanism is thought to be the paradigm for all social relations. They believe that capitalism is intertwined with democracy and freedom. They believe in the necessity (and possibility) of perpetual economic growth. They think that consumption is a part of happiness, and that \u201cmore\u201d must become synonymous with \u201cbetter.\u201d\n\nCapitalism, however, has nothing \u201cconservative\u201d in itself. It is the very opposite of it! Karl Marx already observed that the dismantling of feudalism and the eradication of traditional cultures and ancient values are the result of capitalism, which in turn drowns everything in the \u201cicy water of egotistical calculation.\u201d Today, the capitalist system, more than ever before, is poised toward the over-accumulation of capital. It needs more trade outlets, always more and more markets, always more and more profit. Well, such a goal cannot be achieved unless it first dismantles everything that stands in its way, starting with collective identities first. A full-fledged market economy cannot operate in a sustained manner unless most people have internalized a fashionable culture, consumption, and unlimited growth. Capitalism cannot transform the world into a vast market \u2014 which is also its main goal \u2014 unless the planet becomes fragmented and unless the planet renounces all forms of symbolic imagination which needs to be now replaced by the fever for always something new, as well as for the logic of profit and limitless accumulation.\n\nThis is the reason why capitalism, in its attempt to erase the borders, is also a system that has turned out to be much more effective than communism!   The reason for this is that the economic logic places profits above everything else. Adam Smith wrote that the merchant has no homeland other than his turf where he makes the biggest profit.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why capitalism bears prime responsibility for immigration. On the one hand the use of immigrants enables a downward pressure on workers\u2019 wages; on the other, the very principle of capitalism (\u201d laisser faire, laisser passer\u201d ) including free movement of people, goes hand in hand with free movement of goods and capital. Hence the reason why capital requires increased labor mobility and accordingly continuous migration of labor across national borders seen by capitalists as an obstacle to increased trade.  From this point of view the world market must become the natural setting for \u201cglobal citizenship.\u201d\n\nThe market society offers only a caricature of the social bond since it defines the separation from others as the only true existence. Meanwhile, it commodifies social relationship, that is to say, the relationship between citizens must turn into a carbon copy of the relationship toward and between commodities. This commodification of humans is inseparable from the logic of capitalism. From the point of view of capital, men are objects, indeed they can  only be agents in the production and consumption process, and are solely interconnected through the exchange of goods.\"\n\n\\-A quote from Alain de Benoist, once called the \"spiritual father\" of the modern white nationalist movement.\n\nThese people, like Bernie Sanders, believe that capitalism is the means to achieve open borders, which offends their already inflated group identity. Don't fall for their bullshit.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The alt-right is NOT your friend."}

{"author":"aepryus","created_utc":1533697757,"num_comments":10,"score":3,"selftext":"Recently, I made a post [ https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Libertarian\/comments\/8pa7ep\/libertarianism_via_first_principles\/ ] arguing that:\n\n* any interface between agents can be broken down into six roles\n* an interface between agents is potentially beneficial.\n* an interface is optimally beneficial when its between two agents where each agent cleanly occupies their own side of the interface with no 3rd party interference.\n\nI then did an analysis of a handful of interfaces, most of which were not optimal, that showed the structural source of their inefficiency.  Among those interfaces was a simplistic analysis of healthcare.\n\nI want to delve deeper into healthcare now.  I would argue that there were 4 problematic interfaces in US healthcare prior to the ACA.  I then want to look at how the interfaces might be improved (or made worse) by various proposed solutions.  (There are arguably many more than 4 problematic interfaces, but many of the others are not exclusive to healthcare, such as the financing of education, Dodd-Frank, Sarbannes-Oxley, etc)\n\nThe 4 problematic interfaces are:\n\n* obtaining health insurance\n* seeking medical care\n* obtaining medicine\n* medical malpractice\n\n**Pre-ACA US Healthcare**\n\n*Obtaining Health Insurance*\n\nPrior to the ACA obtaining health insurance was largely done through an employer.  An analysis of this interface:\n\nRole | Side 1 | Side 2\n-------|-------|-------\npayer | employer or medicaid or medicare; person; IRS | insurer\nreceiver | person | insurer\ndecider | employer; person | insurer\n\nFrom the insurer\u2019s side the interface is relatively clean.  The insurer is the payer; they are providing the insurance.  They are the receiver; they receive the premium.  And they are the decider; they get to choose whether to insure their customer or not.\n\nThe other side of the interface, however, is highly convoluted.  The primary payer will be an employer (or in the case of medicare or medicaid, the government), however, the person themselves may be asked to cover some of the premium costs.  The IRS also pays by not taxing the premium paid by the employer as income to the employee, there by losing out on that income tax.  The receiver of the healthcare is the person.  The agent that decides which insurer and what insurance to buy is the employer (although some options maybe available to the person themselves tied to additional premium payments).\n\nThis structure is approximately akin to the Father\u2019s Day tie example in the previous post, but is perhaps made even more inefficient by the additional agents: medicaid, medicare and IRS.\n\n*Note*: It is important to not only look at a single instance of an interface, but rather all instances of an interface in aggregate.  Which, is why it is important to also consider medicaid and medicare.  For example, not every person who orders room service from a hotel is on an expense account.  While at the same time, at least a few meals ordered at McDonald\u2019s are on an expense account.  One interface is efficient and one is not because of the percentages.  As the percentage of transactions involving expense accounts increases the interface in total becomes more inefficient (i.e., the price becomes distorted); as the percentage decreases the interface becomes more efficient (i.e., the price moves towards optimal).\n\n*Seeking Medical Care*\n\nAt some point a person may need some medical care.  Prior to ACA that interface looked as follows:\n\nRole | Side 1 | Side 2\n-------|-------|-------\npayer | insurer or medicaid or medicare; person | doctor; hospital\nreceiver | person | doctor; hospital\ndecider | person; doctor; insurer or medicaid or medicare | doctor; licensing board; AMA\n\nAt a basic level with the person being the receiver and primary decider this interface is analogous to the expense account interface.  But, it is further complicated by a few other elements.\n\nOften times medical decisions are beyond the capability of a lay individual and they will simply trust the advice of their doctor.  This gives the doctor considerable influence over the patient side decider role.\n\nA doctor will also often select the facilities being used.  At no point is a patient being given appraisals of cost and \/ or going out and comparison shopping alternate facility options for their care.\n\nAnother complication is that a healthcare provider must be licensed by the licensing board of their state and \/ or the AMA.  The doctor handing out aspirin and applying bandaids must have the same amount of schooling and residency as the doctor doing brain surgery.\n\nAll of this makes for a structurally convoluted interface that results in a highly inefficient interface.\n\n*Obtaining Medicine*\n\nOnce a doctor determines there is a problem they may prescribe medicine.  This interface suffers from similar structural problems as seeking medical care.\n\nRole | Side 1 | Side 2\n-------|-------|-------\npayer | insurer or medicaid or medicare; person | pharma\nreceiver | person | pharma\ndecider | person; doctor; insurer or medicaid or medicare | pharma; FDA; US Patent Office\n\nLike the \u2018seeking medical care\u2019 interface, this interface has a payer separate from the receiver \/ decider and suffers from the basic expense account structural issue.  However, this too has additional complications.\n\nAgain a lay person will lack the knowledge to effectively decide for themselves what medicine to take and the relative advantages or disadvantages of, for example, competing drugs that aim to alleviate the same issue.  The doctor who may be artificially incentivized by a pharmaceutical company will play a significant part in the patient side decider role.\n\nHowever, a massive encumbrance is the FDA and it\u2019s influence on the decider role of the pharmaceutical side of the interface.  The cost to get a new drug to market is staggering.  Even the cost to bring a well known decades old drug to market as a generic is prohibitive in the US.  The FDA is the wind in Martin Shkreli\u2019s sail.\n\n&gt; As markets for out-of-patent drugs are often small, and obtaining regulatory approval to manufacture a generic version is expensive, Turing calculated that with closed distribution for the product and no competition, it could set high prices.\n \t\t- https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Martin_Shkreli\n\nThe US patent office also plays a substantial role in inflating the price of drugs in the US.  Certainly, there is an intrinsic cost to developing new drugs and that work deserves to be rewarded.  However, too often patents can be abused in order to extend the 14 year grace period.  For example, making a trivial change to a drug that is about to lose its patent protection specifically for the purpose of extending the patent another 14 years.\n\nIn sum, these structural problems conspire to make drugs (and other medical devices) wildly over priced relative to the cost to manufacturer them (and with nearly zero downward pressure in reducing that cost).\n\n*Medical Malpractice*\n\nAnother major source of medical costs in the US are malpractice suits.  The Harvard School of Public Health estimates in the September 2010 issue of Health Affairs that malpractice cost the US $55.6 billion per year accounting for 2.4% of the nations total healthcare expenditure [ https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3048809\/ ]  (This analysis however does not include insurance premiums.  Their rational for this is that insurance premiums include insurance companies profits, so they simply report the amount paid out by insurance companies instead.  However, if one is trying to figure out how much can be saved by eliminating medical malpractice these profit costs are terribly relevant.  This fact is obviously so, and as such, makes me suspicious about bias with this report, attempting to underplay the burden to the system that malpractice represents)\n\nRole | Side 1 | Side 2\n-------|-------|-------\npayer | person | insurer; doctor\nreceiver | person; lawyer | doctor\ndecider | person; lawyer | judiciary\n\nThe patient side of this interface is relatively efficient.  There is perhaps a perverse incentive for lawyers to chase ambulances, but the effect is arguably dwarfed by the issues on the doctor side of the interface.\n\nThe doctor side of the interface has 3 different agents in the 3 different roles.  If the insurer and its deep pockets weren\u2019t involved that alone would perhaps limit the arbitrary awards decided by the judiciary to some degree.  But as it is now, the juries just look at it as free money that the can bequeath to the injured party.\n\n**The Affordable Care Act**\n\nSo, given the structural problems in the American healthcare interfaces what effect did the ACA have on these inherent problems?  Did it fix anything?\n\n*Obtaining Health Insurance*\n\nRole | Side 1 | Side 2\n-------|-------|-------\npayer | employer or medicaid or medicare; person; IRS; **ACA** | insurer\nreceiver | person | insurer\ndecider | employer; person; **ACA** | insurer; **ACA**\n\nThe ACA required all individuals to obtain health insurance, required the states to create healthcare exchanges for obtaining health insurance, provided resources for helping lower income individuals to pay for health insurance and set strict guidelines about what types of insurance could be offered.\n\nIf an insurance company wanted to offer a $10,000 deductible catastrophic health insurance policy and an individual wanted to purchase that product, they had to consult with the ACA for permission for them to make such a contract with one another.  And the ACA says no; that is not a valid product.\n\n*Seeking Medical Care \/ Obtaining Medicine \/ Medical Malpractice*\n\nI know of no direct effect the ACA had on any of these problematic interfaces, however, it certainly did nothing to fix any of the structural problems with them.\n\nI have noticed however numerous healthcare providers explicitly will not work with ACA obtained health insurance.\n\n*Summary*\n\nSo, the ACA rather than fixing a single structural problem with the existing healthcare system, left all the previous problems intact and then added substantial new structural issues to the Obtaining Health Insurance interface.\n\n**Universal Healthcare**\n\nThere are many advocates for Universal Healthcare among the American left.  Numerous countries around the world offer various levels of universal healthcare.  So, what effect would it have on the structural problems in the American healthcare system?\n\n*Obtaining Health Insurance*\n\nThere are variations in how this is handled around the world, but in its ideal form there would be no need for health insurance.  The result is that this problematic interface is eliminated entirely.  So far so good.\n\n*Seeking Medical Care*\n\nRole | Side 1 | Side 2\n-------|-------|-------\npayer | **UHC and maybe** person | **UHC (Universal Healthcare)**\nreceiver | person | **UHC**\ndecider | person; **UHC** | **UHC**, AMA and licensing boards?\n\nSeeking medical care under Universal Healthcare has a major advantage.  Previously, there was an incentive for the doctor to advocate for treatments and more expensive treatments because it would increase revenue; the patient was indifferent to this and generally trusted the advice of the doctor.  The loser in that situation was the insurer, but of course those costs were just passed back to the patient, so the real loser was everyone.\n\nBy making the decider (UHC) and the payer (UHC) the same, that facet of the structural issue is solved.\n\nHowever, it flips the problem to the other side, leaves the major issue intact and then adds a new issue which is far worse.\n\nFrom the person\u2019s perspective this becomes an expense account transaction.  They are the receiver and decider, but not the payer, so they will tend to over pay.  From the UHC\u2019s perspective this is now becomes a Father\u2019s Day tie interface.  They are the payer and decider, but not the receiver, so they will be incentivized to provide the cheapest service (as opposed to before when the doctor was incentivized to provide the most expensive).\n\nBut, the worst part is that the person now no longer has any choice as to where they obtain their healthcare.  The UHC has a monopoly on healthcare and there will be zero incentive for them to provide good service since the person has no choice but to use their services.  Under UHC, this interface now becomes absolutely encumbered.\n\n*Obtaining Medicine*\n\nRole | Side 1 | Side 2\n-------|-------|-------\npayer | **UHC and maybe** person | pharma\nreceiver | person | pharma\ndecider | person; **UHC** | pharma; FDA; US Patent Office\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say what exactly this interface might look like under a UHC system, however at this point its hard to imagine the FDA or patent office being nixed.  It is also hard to imagine that United States nationalizing the pharma companies.  As such, this interface would largely be the same as before with the same problems.\n\nHowever, one advantage the UHC will have here is since they control all the patients, they will have tremendous leverage to apply to pharma companies.  This could result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical companies to reduce costs.\n\nHowever, it also opens up the opportunity for tremendous amounts of corruption.  As the sole consumer of drugs for 320 million people, the people deciding which vendor to select for a particular drug will wield tremendous power.  There will be large incentives to provide kickbacks and \/ or sweet jobs in the future to the government apparatchiks that make these decisions.\n\nAnd if the UHC were to apply too much pressure, perhaps pharma companies would decide its not worth their time to develop new drugs.\n\n*Medical Malpractice*\n\nThe government routinely exempts themselves from liability for anything they do.  It is easy to imagine them extending this exemption to their providing of healthcare there by eliminating another problematic interface.\n\n*Summary*\n\nUniversal Healthcare eliminates two of the problematic interfaces in their entirety (potentially) which is a major benefit to start off with.  A 3rd interface, Obtaining Medicine, remains largely the same with the possibility that UHC is modestly harmful, but certainly does nothing to fix the structural issues.  Unfortunately, the last interface, Seeking Medical Care, (and probably the most important, most significant and most problematic) while having a decent fix for one of its issues, trades it for a different issue and then adds a massive additional issue on top of it all, that likely will dwarf any other potential benefits of UHC entirely.\n\n**Modest Proposals**\n\nSo, if the ACA and UHC failed to fix healthcare, can it be done?  Are their any ways in which these interfaces can be eliminated or improved?\n\n*Obtaining Health Insurance*\n\nFixing this issue is actually relatively straight forward.  Simply removing the employer from the interface will substantially alleviate the structural problems with this interface.  Arguably, the only reason the employer is currently involved is because of the tax break offered by the IRS for employer provided health insurance.  If the health insurance loop hole were removed, companies could take the money they currently pay for health insurance and use it to increase their employees salaries.  The employee can then use that additional (taxed) income to purchase health insurance on their own.\n\nOne potential downside of this is that perhaps an employee will not use that money to purchase health insurance.  In this case the system opens itself up to demagoguery.  Really, a massive amount of the problems of healthcare simply derive from demagoguery or the threat of it.  One solution to that issue is to train people to ignore it, which from an economic stand point would be the optimal solution.\n\nHowever, there are perhaps other solutions to the demagoguery issue.  For example, health savings accounts.  Instead of employers providing health insurance they (or in the case of medicaid and medicare) could provide direct payments into individual\u2019s health savings accounts.  This earmarked money can then be used to purchase health insurance and cover other medical costs.\n\nThe result of these changes would be:\n\nRole | Side 1 | Side 2\n-------|-------|-------\npayer | person | insurer\nreceiver | person | insurer\ndecider | person | insurer\n\ntransforming the acquiring of health insurance into an optimal interface.  The government could even make payments to the HSA tax deductible and exempt them from capital gains, interest and estate taxes.\n\nThere is still a difference between the ignore demagoguery (ID) and the health savings account systems in that the the ID system allows for even greater economic benefit.  Earmarked money and \/ or money received for free will be less valuable to individuals then normal money and will therefore be spent more freely (easy come, easy go).\n\nBut, there is always the threat that demagoguery will bring down the whole ID system, i.e., that ignoring it will never be possible.  And as such the HSA system may provide most of the economic benefit without the fear of demagoguery.\n\nThere is perhaps a 3rd solution: make health insurance illegal.  The advantage of this is that the interface is eliminated entirely.  There are however, two downsides to this option.  One, it also suffers from the demagoguery issue and two, there is one legitimate use for health insurance, which is to smooth out the risks of health care costs, i.e., to pay the expectation value of costs rather than the actual costs.  By eliminating insurance, healthcare becomes a form of gambling.\n\n*Seeking Medical Care*\n\nThis interface has been particularly problematic for the above solutions, but perhaps there are some simple ways to improve this interface.\n\nProposal 1: make health insurance illegal.  Making health insurance illegal will have massive economic benefits to this interface, but it will make paying for particularly problematic (i.e., expensive) healthcare issues difficult.\n\nProposal 2: make health insurance aside from catastrophic insurance illegal.  This will solve many of healthcare\u2019s ills.  However, there will still be most of the economic problems with any non-trivial medical procedure.  Plus, there remains some potential for demagoguery for simpler healthcare issues.\n\nProposal 3: only allow healthcare providers to offer health insurance.  This is the Kaiser-Permanente model and has the benefit of eliminating the expense account interface problem.  However, it replaces it with the Father\u2019s Day tie problem.\n\nProposal 4: healthcare savings accounts.  Healthcare savings accounts, particularly ones offering tax benefits or injected into by employers or the government can offer much economic structural benefits while removing the potential of demagoguery for day to day healthcare expenses.  However, it still suffers from issues with catastrophic issues.\n\nProposal 5: fixed payout catastrophic insurance.  It is perhaps possible to come up with an \u201caverage cost to treat\u201d index which analyzes data in order to determine the average cost to treat any and all healthcare issues.  Once such an index exists, it would be possible to offer a new kind of catastrophic health insurance that rather than paying healthcare bills provides cash payments to effected individuals once diagnosed with various ailments.\n\nThis solves the structural economic issues with this interface for catastrophic issues, by allowing the patient to use the money as they see fit or potentially not use it at all and just keep it.  This also largely solves the demagoguery issue.  Even if an individual chose to buy a Lamborghini instead of seeking cancer treatment, it would probably be pretty challenging to demagogue such a case.\n\nBut, perhaps a major downside of this option is that it opens itself up to fraud.\n\nProposal 6: Separate diagnostics and treatment.  Currently, there is too much incentive on a doctor to advocate for expensive or unnecessary treatments ( https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2015\/dec\/22\/doctor-who-ordered-unnecessary-heart-surgery-and-risky-tests-jailed-for-20-years )  One way to mitigate this problem is to create two independent healthcare entities, one for dealing with diagnostics and perhaps advising on types of treatments and another for actually treating.  Since the diagnostician will not benefit from the treatment of the patient, there is no incentive to advocate for unnecessary procedures.\n\nOne issue with this is that medicine currently is often not an exact science.  Often times treatments themselves can be a form of diagnosis.  (Give them the cure, if it works, we know what they had!)  Also, creating strong regulations prohibiting how companies operate often have unintended consequences.\n\nProposal 7: eliminate medical licensing.  By eliminating licensing, perhaps new types of healthcare providers can develop that can competently handle lower level healthcare issues for substantially less cost.  Also, perhaps new and improved ways of training healthcare providers can be experimented with and developed that improve care and \/ or reduce costs.\n\nAn obvious downside of this is the potential rise in quackery.  However, if an individual\u2019s or company's results are poor they will be selected against in the market.  Furthermore, there is always the potential for private rating organizations to organically arise that can provide vetting and validation services for healthcare providers.  (I.e., this individual is entirely competent to hand out aspirin; this individual is entirely competent to set a broken bone and apply a cast to it; this individual is entirely competent to open up your skull and perform surgery on your brain.)\n\nPerhaps a combination of HSAs and fixed payout catastrophic insurance with mandatory payment into an HSA, combined with elimination of medical licensing and a recommendation to seek diagnose and treatment separately would be able to largely alleviate the structural economic issues with his interface while maintaining the catastrophic protections and protection from demagoguery.  Converting the interface to:\n\nRole | Side 1 | Side 2\n-------|-------|-------\npayer | person | provider\nreceiver | person | provider\ndecider | person | provider\n\n\n*Obtaining Medicine*\nIn general, the cost to manufacturer pharmaceuticals is not inherently expensive.  However, drugs account for about 13% of US healthcare costs.  Certainly, while perhaps not expensive to produce drugs can be expensive to develop, so perhaps some of the high margin is justified.  But those cost to develop and the cost to manufacture even old, well known drugs is made greatly higher because of the FDA.\n\nProposal 0: Piggy backing on some or all of the proposals in the \u2018seeking medical care\u2019 section above will also help with \u2018obtaining medicine\u2019.  I will not re-list them here.\n\nHowever, perhaps there also some more that can be done:\n\nProposal 1:  Exempt drugs from health insurance.  The benefit of health insurance is to even out costs spikes.  Drugs are not expensive to produce and their ultimate cost would not represent a large spike.  Once these drugs were exposed to free market forces, they would see prices similar to any pain reliever.\n\nProposal 2: Eliminate the FDA.  The huge demagoguerific victory for the FDA was the decision to not allow Thalidomide to be sold in the United States.  This prevented an unknown number of US babies from experiencing the horrific effects of the drug.  However, how many medicines have not been produced or not come to market in time since and how many people have died because of that.  How many people died because drugs are too expensive.  And how much money and resources have been wasted; prevented from being used on other health care or on something else entirely by saving a few 100s (or 1000s?) of babies in the 60s.\n\nDrug makers have a vested interest in not killing their patients and a vested interested in not creating dangerous drugs.  There are natural incentives for doing extensive drug testing on their new drugs.  But, perhaps that testing minus government bureaucracy, cronyism and corruption can be substantially more efficient and substantially cheaper.\n\nProposal 3: Eliminate the patenting of drugs.  This could perhaps have a massive immediate effect on the cost of drugs (especially when coupled with eliminating the FDA).  However, it could also have a horrible long term effect on the development of new drugs.\n\nProposal 4: Crack down on the re-patenting of old drugs.  There are perhaps great reasons for having patents.  They motivate pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs which can benefit patients that are helped by those new drugs.  But, the system can be abused.  Rather than going through all the risk and work of developing a brand new drug, it is perhaps a lot cheaper and easier to simply tweak an existing drug.  Being able to patent that tweaked drug should raise a number of eyebrows and anything that can be done to nix the practice would have great benefits without killing the incentives to develop new medicine.\n\nProposal 5: Drug bounties.  The concept of the patent is that the users of the drug will pay for the development of the drug for 14 years and then after that development costs will have been recovered and the cost of the drug can revert to the cost to manufacturer without the development costs themselves.\n\nHowever, this is problematic.  What if the development costs are recovered in 3 years or what if they aren\u2019t recovered for 50 years.  There is nothing magical about a 14 year timespan.  And how does the number of people suffering from a certain ailment effect the economics of all of this?  Certainly, it would make sense for pharma companies to devote their resources to creating drugs that can help the largest number of people.  But, if they happen to discover a cure to something that only a few people suffer from how should that drug be priced?\n\nAnd wouldn\u2019t it be great if other companies could contribute to trying to improve the manufacturing process in that time?\n\nPerhaps better than a patent system, would be a bounty system where people or companies or governments could pay money into bounties for curing specific diseases on the condition that the winning drugs are not patented.  Companies could see what bounties are available for which diseases and devote resources to trying to cure them.  Once a company cures a specific disease, they instantly collect the bounty\n\nRole | Side 1 | Side 2\n-------|-------|-------\npayer | person | pharma\nreceiver | person | pharma\ndecider | person | pharma\n\n*Medical Malpractice*\n\nAs mentioned above, medical malpractice accounts for about 2% of US healthcare costs.  Getting rid of this cost saves billions of dollars.\n\nProposal 1: Exempt health care providers from malpractice suits.  This eliminates this interface entirely, instantly saving billions of dollars of expenses.  However, perhaps, doctors will become less careful.  And if licensing were also to be removed perhaps the threat of malpractice suits would become even more important.\n\nProposal 2: Exempt health care providers from civil suits until they are convicted in a criminal case.  This perhaps still provides incentives on healthcare providers to quality care without needlessly costing billions of dollars to do so.  But, it does put a lot of power in the hands of the judiciary.\n\nProposal 3: Centralized review system.  Yelp, AppStore, Amazon, Rotten Tomatoes, Uber, AirBnB: reviews have done an amazing job of increasing quality and customer support while helping people steer clear of problematic situations.  A public or private review system for health care providers could perhaps create substantially better quality benefits than malpractice suits without the expense being added to the system.\n\n**Summary**\n\nHealthcare in the US is a massive problem.  Generally, solutions currently being discussed are kludges that ultimately make a bad problem even worse.  By considering the basic structural problems in the interfaces that are causing the problems and trying to fix those directly, actual improvements can be made.\n\nThe best solution is for people to ignore demagogues and allow the various agents to interface with one another in an entirely unencumbered manner, but, that may not be realistic.  Here there are listed a handful of tentative proposals that attack the root of the problem; not all of them are purely advantageous; although perhaps a few of them are.\n\nThere are solutions to the US healthcare issues.  Perhaps the solutions are proposals listed here; perhaps the solutions are iterations on proposals listed here; perhaps the solutions are missed here entirely.  But, whatever the solutions are, they will address the root structural issues in these 4 healthcare interfaces; they will create unencumbered interfaces between the various agents that incentivizes prices to go down and quality to go up.\n\nAnd when that happens, everyone will benefit.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Fixing US Healthcare"}

For those who missed it, here at the top 6 takeaways from Brandon and the other Top Minds at \/r\/WalkAway!\n\n**1.  He's takes funding from InfoWars.**  \n\nAnd he is [\"so grateful\"](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/walkaway\/comments\/956lnq\/hi_everyone_im_brandon_straka_founder_of_walkaway\/e3qhxd1) for Alex Jones's support.  And of course, Straka wants to [defend the need for InfoWars to have a platform for defamation of school shooting victims](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/walkaway\/comments\/956lnq\/hi_everyone_im_brandon_straka_founder_of_walkaway\/e3qgtsz)  But those things are probably unconnected.  \n\nThe top mind mods at \/r\/WalkAway also [don't want you to know](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/FB7ITnY) who else might be funding him. \n\n**2.  He's positive Russians aren't promoting WalkAway.**\n\nEven though he [has eagerly appeared](https:\/\/www.rt.com\/usa\/431666-walkaway-democrats-straka-campaign-gay\/) on [Russian propaganda TV station RT](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/RT_\\(TV_network\\)) to promote WalkAway, he's certain he would [refuse any Russian involvement](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/walkaway\/comments\/956lnq\/hi_everyone_im_brandon_straka_founder_of_walkaway\/e3qfbzm) in the campaign.  \n\nHis totally trustworthy opinion is that the [considerable evidence that the \\#WalkAway is being astroturfed by Russian trolls](https:\/\/arcdigital.media\/pro-trump-russian-linked-twitter-accounts-are-posing-as-ex-democrats-in-new-astroturfed-movement-20359c1906d3) is liberal bias.      \n\n**3.  The people behind walkaway are REAL, and he can't name a single one of them.**\n\nWhen asked for evidence that there are real Democrats leaving the party, he offered a simple insistance that these people were REAL with CAPITAL LETTERS.  He [declined to offer](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/walkaway\/comments\/956lnq\/hi_everyone_im_brandon_straka_founder_of_walkaway\/e3qfl5h) a single specific example, even later in the thread stating that [\"every testimonial is his favorite\"](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/walkaway\/comments\/956lnq\/hi_everyone_im_brandon_straka_founder_of_walkaway\/e3qhhiz)!   Trust him, [all of these ~~bots~~ people with copypasting the same \\#WalkAway messages](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NewKnowledgeAI\/status\/1013464006496063488) are very real, as are all the [lifelong democrats who suddenly were born again as conservatives](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/the-intersect\/wp\/2018\/07\/02\/the-walkaway-meme-is-what-happens-when-everything-is-viral-and-nothing-matters\/).  These are [REAL patriots](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/WWIaFIV), folks.      \n\n**4.  Other than gay rights, he can't name a single liberal position he used to support before he \"Walked Away.\"**\n\nHe declined to answer several questions (examples: [[1]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/walkaway\/comments\/956lnq\/hi_everyone_im_brandon_straka_founder_of_walkaway\/e3qkxvp), [[2]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/walkaway\/comments\/956lnq\/hi_everyone_im_brandon_straka_founder_of_walkaway\/e3qk1t0), [[3]](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/walkaway\/comments\/956lnq\/hi_everyone_im_brandon_straka_founder_of_walkaway\/e3qhsh8)) about what liberal policies he supported before he became born-again conservative.  Rachel Maddow's tweets about Trump's tax returns were the [final straw for him though](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/8VNWCl6), because he hates women's golf and those things are the same.       \n\n**5.  For a hair stylist, his hair advice is [pretty shit.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/walkaway\/comments\/956lnq\/hi_everyone_im_brandon_straka_founder_of_walkaway\/e3qk90o)**\n\nFortunately though, he's stopped [doing blowouts](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/walkaway\/comments\/956lnq\/hi_everyone_im_brandon_straka_founder_of_walkaway\/e3qhmb4\/?context=8&amp;depth=9) now that he's really busy [~~merchandising~~](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/eFH7m3G) saving America.  \n\n**6.  He wants to [change the narrative](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/walkaway\/comments\/956lnq\/hi_everyone_im_brandon_straka_founder_of_walkaway\/e3qk644) about how \"hateful\" people on the right are.**  \n\nThat's why he's teamed up with the [awesome former democrat mods](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/zB9z9gZ) at \/r\/Walkaway, who are not hateful at all.  He's [assembling a team of 'outstanding and dynamic'](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/walkaway\/comments\/956lnq\/hi_everyone_im_brandon_straka_founder_of_walkaway\/e3qhve9) people to help grow [~~his merchandise business~~](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/eFH7m3G) this important movement.  And from the looks it, he's off to a great start!  Like, just look at the totally civil, totes real redditors who worked tirelessly to promote his AMA all over reddit:\n\n* [Aldebaran333](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/u\/Aldebaran333) was the very first redditor [promote Brandon's AMA](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/walkaway\/comments\/948foa\/brandon_straka_ama_at_rwalkaway_founder_of_viral\/).

{"author":"EconHacker","created_utc":1533838685,"num_comments":174,"score":104,"selftext":"Within libertarian circles it is common to find the belief that people with socialist orientations are menacing collectivists who are intent on oppressing others and stealing from them\n\nWithin socialist circles it is common to find the belief that people with libertarian orientations are greedy thugs who don't care about anyone except themselves\n\nIn both cases, this is an example of straw-manning. In particular, it is a straw manning of the *intentions* of members of the other group. I have no problem with the groups critiquing each other's *strategy* and *description* of the problems of the world, but it gets problematic when members of one group claim that the *moral character* of members of the other group is fundamentally 'bad'\n\nThe best way to come to some common understanding between the groups is to try understand their respective *orientations* or *impulses*. To me this is best described with an analogy:\n\n* The libertarian orientation is something like this: *I'm a rugged individual on a stormy natural ocean, surviving against the odds on a raft of my own making*\n* The socialist orientation is something like this: *We're a scattered collective thrown into a huge artificial wavepool, coming together to survive and get out of it*\n\nThe key difference concerns what you perceive yourself to be struggling against in the world. In my experience, libertarians tend to perceive a *natural struggle* against the elements, and argue that you cannot end the struggle, but can only manage it and attempt to survive and thrive within it.\n\nSocialists, on the other hand, tend to see this apparent 'natural struggle' as an illusion, and believe that it is an artificial injustice that can be overcome through cooperation. Indeed, within actual Marxist theory (rather than straw man characterizations of it) it would be predicted that libertarianism would emerge, because people within a large-scale market system do not realise that the struggles they perceive are in fact the product of a large interconnected human system, rather than a natural law.\n\nSometimes the divide between libertarians and socialists is put in terms of 'do you want the state or not', but this is a spurious characterization of the differences. The key thing is about how the groups see the state relating to the 'struggle' referred to above. Libertarians critique the state as attempting to deviate from, or mess with, the natural order of things, trying to 'fix' a natural struggle that cannot be fixed.\n\nSocialists are often referred to as 'statists' by libertarians, but many socialists do not fetishise the state. They simply perceive it as either 1) something that upholds the artificial struggle they perceive and\/or 2) something that may therefore be co-opted to end that artificial struggle. Socialists have as much as history of critiquing the state as they do of supporting it - original Marxist theory *explicitly* talks about the state as the thing used to uphold a capitalist system.\n\nThe broader point remains though. I don't think the key divide between the groups is 'freedom vs collectivist statism' - that is a straw man. The key divide is whether you think people can come together to overcome some collective struggle or whether you think that is futile, misguided and going against a natural order, one that only works when individuals are guided primarily by their private pursuits. And yes, a whole range of different people can totally legitimately come to both of these conclusions, depending on their backgrounds, experience, personality and economic situation.\n\nI've been inspired to write this because my experience of people on both sides of this divide runs contrary to what they say about each other. I know many libertarians who are kind and do not fit the 'profiteering asshole' stereotype that socialists put on them, and I know many socialists who are completely the opposite of the 'oppressive collectivist' stereotype that libertarians put on them. The groups don't have to agree, but I at least hope they can come to treat each other with more mutual respect in future\n\nAny thoughts welcome. This is based on my personal experiences, and I may have misinterpreted them","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I spend a lot of time in *both* libertarian and socialist circles.

I have experiences organizing with socialist groups and have been getting very frustrated in how many people in these organizations approach organizing to affect real change. What is also frustrating is that I am a libertarian socialist (nice way of saying non-bomb-throwing-anarchist) and I do not like a lot of the \"big government\" or bureaucratic solutions being offered. Much of the activism involves lobbying politicians (dead end) and protesting (people ignore it and don't care or just plain think we are crazy). I don't believe these strategies are going to work, and I do not like the more anti-liberty factions within the whole movement. What I want from the world of socialist thought is worker empowerment and popular control at the local level, I do not want a politburo.\n\nA popular socialist slogan these days is \"A Better World is Possible\". I say, if it is, then why are we not actively building this world? (My suggestions would be worker owned cooperatives dedicated to solving real problems operating outside of bureaucracies)\n\nI do not want to debate socialism versus capitalism, or libertarianism versus authoritarianism or any of that (it may be interesting that I am not necessarily against free markets, and do not equate the free market with the current structures of capitalism.

This would mean that the Government's welfare program would almost cease to exist, with the government receiving much less tax revenue. People can work hard all their lives, but all it takes is one thing unfortunate to occur for everything in their lives to go to shit. What if for some reason they are fired and can't find work? Without the welfare system and a supportive family they would have no where to live.  A good welfare system could let them live in humane conditions, while they try to find work.\n\nThe thing I like about the welfare and government programs is that it gives people the opportunity to achieve success, even if they are born into a poor, shitty family if they work hard enough in school. Mistake me if I'm wrong, but libertarians believe all schools should be privatised. If a family couldn't afford to send their children to school then how would the child ever escape the poverty they were born into? Seems impossible if they can never gain the qualifications and skills required to find a job.\n\nUltimately, I believe the free market is the best way to maximise living standards and innovation, but the government should interfere in some aspects to ensure greater fairness.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Libertarian economic policy seems inhumane.

{"author":"PrestigiousProof","created_utc":1533928199,"num_comments":18,"score":0,"selftext":"According to *Wikipedia*, **\u201cA kangaroo court is a judicial  tribunal or assembly that blatantly disregards recognized standards of  law or justice, and often carries little or no official standing in the  territory within which it resides.\"**\n\n[Merriam-Webster](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Merriam-Webster) \"***The  term may also apply to a court held by a legitimate judicial authority  who intentionally disregards the court\u2019s legal or ethical obligations.\u201d*** \\[1\\]   \n\nThe last sentence I emphasized, I think, truly applies to the U.S.  Court of Federal Claims, Vaccine Claims\/Office of Special Masters. \\[2\\]  Why would I think that?  Well, many reasons come to mind, but probably  the most significant is the fact that a majority of damaged vaccines have their claims denied, which was not the original intent of the 1986 Congressional action taken, i.e., to provide proper care for those  damaged by vaccines. \n\nThe official federal vaccine program website  states that the \u201cThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program  (\u201cVaccine Program\u201d) comprises Part 2 of the National Childhood Vaccine  Injury Act of 1986 (\u201cVaccine Act\u201d). See Pub. L. No. 99-660, 100 Stat.  3755 (1986) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-1 to -34).\u201d  \n\nFurthermore, \n\n&gt;It establishes the Vaccine Program as a ***no-fault compensation*** program whereby petitions for monetary compensation may be brought by or on behalf of persons ***allegedly suffering injury or death as a result of the administration of certain compulsory childhood vaccines.*** Congress  intended that the Vaccine Program provide individuals a swift, flexible, and less adversarial alternative to the often costly and lengthy civil arena of                 traditional tort litigation. \\[2\\] \n\nSeveral things jump out with regard to the above: \n\n1. ***allegedly*** suffering injury or death as a result of administration \n2. of certain compulsory childhood vaccines \n3. swift\u2014Hah!  Nothing is swift at the vaccine court.  The average time is 2 \u00bd to 3 years. \n4. Less adversarial alternative than civil tort litigation\u2014talk to  those who have gone through the vaccine court, and really listen to  their sad stories. \n\nAs far as I\u2019m aware, ***there is no federal law regarding compulsory vaccinations.***   Vaccine laws kick in at state levels. The CDC even admits that on [its website](http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/vaccines\/imz-managers\/laws\/state-reqs.html)  that \n\n&gt;In the U.S., the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) regulates and licenses all vaccines to ensure safety and effectiveness. ***No federal vaccinations exist,***  but all 50 states require certain vaccinations for children entering public schools. Depending on the state, children must be vaccinated against some or all of the following diseases: [mumps, measles, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, and polio](http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/vaccines\/vpd-vac\/default.htm).  \n\nSo,  how come the proverbial \u201capples-and-oranges\u201d are being mixed with regard to who\u2019s liable for compensation due to vaccine damage? Shouldn\u2019t each state also be held accountable and liable financially since they pass the laws?  However, states don\u2019t provide relief!  So, why are the feds involved, besides regulating and licensing vaccines? Furthermore, is there a possible clue in \u201cFollow the money?\u201d\n\nAs a result of Public Law No. 99-660, 100 Stat. 3755 (1986) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300aa-1 to -34), ***the feds collect a tax on each vaccine dose sold,*** which is placed into a \u2018supposed trust fund\u2019 to pay out claims. \n\n&gt;The Trust Fund is funded by a $0.75 excise  tax on vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention for routine administration to children. The excise tax is imposed on each dose (disease that is prevented) of a  vaccine. Trivalent influenza vaccine for example, is taxed  $0.75 because it prevents one disease; measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which prevents three diseases, is taxed $2.25. ***The Department of Treasury collects the       excise taxes*** ***and manages the Fund\u2019s investments.*** \\[3\\]  \n\n***Who collects the money?***  Additionally, what is the current asset-value of those Trust Fund investments? Who knows? Where  is an official accounting of vaccine \u201cexcise taxes\u201d collected? Not  being able to find that trust fund\u2019s assets or investments, I sent off  this email in search of that information: \n\nDear Ms. Marilyn Evans, U.S. Treasury: \n\n&gt;Would you please direct me to where I can obtain the current asset balance of the Vaccine Excise Tax Trust  Fund that funds the HRSA \/ Vaccine Court awards.  I can find the  amounts of awards paid out over the years, but I\u2019m having difficulty in finding how much has been paid into that Vaccine  Excise Tax Trust Fund since its inception, over the years, and what its current             asset value is\/was as of the 2014 or 2015 fiscal year.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Thank you for your assistance and considerations to my request.   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Sincerely,   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Catherine J Frompovich   \n&gt;  \n&gt;Consumer health researcher\/author\/journalist \n\nI don\u2019t think I will get an answer by the time I publish this article\u2014or ever, but whatever answer I receive, I will share with my  readers. \n\n***However, I\u2019m not the only one who seems to be asking questions.***  \n\nAndrew Zajac of *BloombergBusiness* wrote an article March 18, 2015, [\u201cVaccine\u2019s Court Tough Standards May Face Supreme Court Test\u201d](http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-18\/vaccine-court-s-tough-standards-may-face-supreme-court-tes)  wherein he states, and also provides a U.S. HHS chart, that **\u201cVaccine Court Rejects Most Claims,\u201d** something I\u2019ve questioned as being unfair, not equitable, and possibly \u2018prejudiced\u2019.  Why? Because of **procedures and how the vaccine court is set up\u2014seemingly, in my opinion, \u2018stacked\u2019  in** ***\u201cconsensus science\u201d*** **that vaccines are not capable of causing damage, plus compounded by the fact that there is no jury of  peers\u2014just \u201cSpecial Masters\u201d who, I think, may have to maintain quotas  in favor of vaccines not causing damage.**  However, the CDC\u2019s VAERS reporting system has hundreds of thousands of adverse reactions reported  regarding health problems resulting after receiving  vaccines\/vaccinations.\n\nFurthermore, former FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler was of the opinion that **less than one percent of doctors reported pharmaceutical adverse events, and vaccines are pharmaceuticals!** \\[7, 8\\]\n\n***Vaccine damage is not just a swollen arm or fever.*** \n\nThere are horrible side effects that need to be addressed and compensated for \u2013 which mostly are not \u2013 as many victims\u2019 parents and\/or advocates attest to.  One claim, *Bruesewitz v Wyeth*, went to the U.S. Supreme Court, only to be shot down on what I would consider a legal loophole and technicality falling back onto the National Childhood  Vaccine Injury Act that Congress enacted.  However, shortly after the 6  to 2 decision in early 2011, I read both the concurring opinion and the  two SCOTUS members\u2019 dissenting arguments\u2014Justices Sotomayor and  Ginsburg, who actually had the case figured out correctly, in my opinion. \\[4\\] \n\n# Every MD needs to rethink his\/her Hippocratic Oath, which states, \u201cFirst do no harm.\u201d  \n\n**References:** \n\n\\[1\\] [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kangaroo\\_court](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kangaroo_court)   \n\\[2\\] [http:\/\/www.uscfc.uscourts.gov\/vaccine-programoffice-special-masters](http:\/\/www.uscfc.uscourts.gov\/vaccine-programoffice-special-masters)   \n\\[3\\] [http:\/\/www.hrsa.gov\/vaccinecompensation\/index.html](http:\/\/www.hrsa.gov\/vaccinecompensation\/index.html)   \n\\[4\\] [http:\/\/www.scotusblog.com\/case-files\/cases\/bruesewitz-v-wyeth\/](http:\/\/www.scotusblog.com\/case-files\/cases\/bruesewitz-v-wyeth\/)   \n\\[5\\] [http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-18\/vaccine-court-s-tough-standards-may-face-supreme-court-test](http:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-03-18\/vaccine-court-s-tough-standards-may-face-supreme-court-test)   \n\\[6\\] [http:\/\/www.vaccineriskawareness.com\/Vaccine-Injury-Photos-From-The-CDC](http:\/\/www.vaccineriskawareness.com\/Vaccine-Injury-Photos-From-The-CDC)   \n\\[7\\] Kessler, DA. \u201cIntroducing MEDWatch,\u201d JAMA, June 2, 1993: 2765-2768   \n\\[8\\] [http:\/\/www.naturalblaze.com\/2013\/10\/the-costs-of-vaccine-damage-payout.html](http:\/\/www.naturalblaze.com\/2013\/10\/the-costs-of-vaccine-damage-payout.html) \n\n\\[9\\] [https:\/\/www.activistpost.com\/2015\/03\/us-vaccine-court-kangaroo-or-what.html](https:\/\/www.activistpost.com\/2015\/03\/us-vaccine-court-kangaroo-or-what.html)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Make Informed Decisions ---- The Kangaroo Vaccine Court"}

Or, does the government not have a role in inflation\/deflation? Is the government the main cause of both issues, can it solve them both, or can it only solve one of them? I've read a bit of Friedman on the topic and he suggests that increases in the money supply are what drives inflation. But, I've also read that decreases in the money supply can cause deflation, which could be worse. Honestly, I have no clue.

Although individuals probably have a genetic  predisposition to develop autism, researchers suspect that one or more  environmental triggers are also needed. \n\n**One of those triggers might be the battery of vaccinations that young children receive.** \n\nUsing regression analysis and controlling for family income and ethnicity, the relationship between the proportion of children who received the  recommended vaccines by age 2 years and the prevalence of autism (AUT) or speech or language impairment (SLI) in each U.S. state from 2001 and 2007 was determined. A positive and statistically significant  relationship was found: \n\n**The higher the proportion of children receiving recommended vaccinations, the higher was the prevalence of autism or SLI.**\n\nA  1% increase in vaccination was associated with an additional 680  children having AUT or SLI. \n\nNeither parental behavior nor access to care affected the results, since vaccination proportions were not significantly related (statistically) to any other disability or to the number of pediatricians in a U.S. state. \n\nThe results suggest that although mercury has been removed from many vaccines, other culprits may link vaccines to autism.

This conspiracy against fat has gotten a lot of press recently, but the benefits of a high fat diet are often overlooked.  Maybe the most effective of these is the ketogenic diet. \n\nSadly in today's world we all know people suffering from brain related disorders,  Alzheimers, Parkinsons and even Autism. What follows might be the most effective way of helping them.\n\nThe ketogenic diet was originally developed at Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1920s to stop seizures in children with\u00a0epilepsy, when pharmaceutical drugs did not work. More recently, **the ketogenic diet has been used successfully for neurological disorders such as** [Alzheimer\u2019s disease](https:\/\/healthimpactnews.com\/2018\/the-high-fat-ketogenic-diet-for-cognitive-health-proven-remedies-for-the-alzheimers-epidemic\/).\n\nRecently, there have been efforts by some researchers and medical practitioners to explore the potential of **ameliorating schizophrenia**, a major brain disorder that affects one out of a hundred, with the aid of the ketogenic diet.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s make sure we understand what schizophrenia is about.  It\u2019s not really the split or multiple personality types of syndrome many consider it to be.\n\nHere are major symptom descriptions which, if persistent and disabling, indicate one is schizophrenic:\n\n* Delusion: With [different manifestations](https:\/\/psychcentral.com\/encyclopedia\/delusion\/) that are chronic, pronounced, and fiercely defended.\n* Hallucinations: They can [manifest through any of the senses](https:\/\/psychcentral.com\/encyclopedia\/hallucination\/) and be real only to schizophrenics.\n* Disorganized speech patterns.\n* Seriously disorganized outward behavior or the opposite \u2013 catatonic.\n* Total disinterest in performing productive tasks to their conclusion.\n\nSchizophrenic behavior is sometimes, but not usually, not aggressively violent unless provoked forcibly. Suicidal thoughts or impulses are more common. Most  schizophrenics are victim oriented. [(Source)](https:\/\/psychcentral.com\/disorders\/schizophrenia\/schizophrenia-symptoms\/)\n\nThe  first three symptoms listed above are categorized as \u201cpositive symptoms.\u201d They involve subjective perceptions that nobody else is aware of, or they demonstrate impulsive socially inappropriate activity. Abilities lost, such as emotional expressiveness, interest in studies, work projects, and social skills are considered \u201cnegative symptoms.\u201d  Both can exist simultaneously.

(\u2026.)  there is **evidence** on dopaminergic transmission defects, there is a need to find a more holistic way in treating the disease and a diet regimen could be one of  them. (\u2026) **The key mechanism is to generate ketosis**. \u2026 Possible  hypothesis can be that ketogenic diet changes the ratio of GABA:  glutamate in favor of GABA, \u2026 and furthers the **increase of GABA** \u2026 to compensate the disrupted GABA levels in the schizophrenic brain, (\u2026) \\[Emphasis added\\] [(Source)](https:\/\/www.medical-hypotheses.com\/article\/S0306-9877%2818%2930471-7\/fulltext)\n\nKeywords are evidence and increase of GABA, which is the commonly used acronym for gamma-aminobutyric acid. **GABA  is an amino acid that is not a building block for protein.  It acts an  inhibitory neurotransmitter to slow things down a bit before the brain  spins out of control and burns out.**\n\nMost  GABA is created in the body by breaking down glutamate, which is a  neurotransmitter that functions like other neurotransmitters:   adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin. Those all accelerate  neuron firing. [(Source)](http:\/\/overcomingyouranxiety.net\/naturalanxietyremedies\/gaba-for-anxiety\/)\n\nSo,  the \u201cevidence\u201d referred to in the study abstract are other studies  related to the same topic of brain or nervous system inflammation and  biochemical imbalance reduction from ketogenic dieting.  They also  mention how **\u201cincreasing GABA\u201d production in the brain leads to improved mental health.**\n\nHere are a few samples of those other studies that explore the ketogenic diet\u2019s effect on neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate:\n\n### [Ketogenic diet reverses behavioral abnormalities in an acute NMDA receptor hypofunction model of schizophrenia](https:\/\/research.jcu.edu.au\/bmdt\/publications\/publications-1\/kraeuter-et-al-schizophrenia)\n\n### [Ketogenic diet, brain glutamate metabolism and seizure control ](https:\/\/www.plefa.com\/article\/S0952-3278%2803%2900218-7\/fulltext)\n\n### [Neuronal-glial interactions in rats fed a ketogenic diet](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16542760)\n\n### [Ketogenic diet in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder: Two case studies](https:\/\/www.schres-journal.com\/article\/S0920-9964%2817%2930063-4\/abstract)\n\n[Great video here.](https:\/\/youtu.be\/X4E2AQeEAdw)\n\n### [Mitoprotective   dietary approaches for Myalgic Encephalomyelitis\/Chronic Fatigue   Syndrome: Caloric restriction, fasting, and ketogenic diets](https:\/\/www.medical-hypotheses.com\/article\/S0306-9877%2815%2900318-7\/fulltext)\n\n## Beyond GABA: Ketogenic Dieting Builds Brain Matter\n\nIn addition to insufficient GABA to regulate neurotransmitters, there is an obvious matter of measurable brain mass loss **among schizophrenics, up to 25 percent loss of brain gray matter has been observed** with CT scans and MRIs.\n\n**Mainstream  medicine has finally conceded that it is possible for the brain to  regenerate cells of all types but insists on creating synthetic  pharmaceutical drugs for high profits that often do more harm than   good.** [\\*\\*(\\*\\*Source)](https:\/\/www.healthyplace.com\/thought-disorders\/schizophrenia-effects\/schizophrenia-brain-impact-of-schizophrenia-on-the-brain)\n\nThe ketogenic diet involves a high-fat diet with moderate meat consumption and low grains.

Gray matter in different areas of the brain is where most neurons  exist that determine  cognitive skills, memory, planning, and  recognizing environmental similarities and differences.\n\nThe  growth or regrowth of gray matter cells depends on the amount of fatty  acids available.

If they are, call them out. \n\nWhen fascists are in the wild, they almost never say they are fascist, and they will rarely say what they really mean (unless they are trolling).  Fascists try to communicate their ideas through dogwhistles. For example, instead of saying \u201cprotecting the white race\u201d, a fascist might say \u201cprotecting Western culture\u201d. The phrase \u201cWestern culture\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the person is a fascist, but you have to look at the context of how its being used. You should try to pick up on as many fascist dog whistles as possible. \n\nThey also try to hide behind irony and memes. jokes like \u201cdindu nuthin\u201d and \u201cwe wuz kings and shit\u201d are identifiers for racist and probably fascist people. \n\nThe easiest way to find if someone is a fascist is to check their post history. They will try to call you out for cheating if you do this, but they\u2019re just mad their cover was blown. Some of the subreddits that signal someone could be alt right or fascist are\n\n\/r\/milliondollarextreme\n\n\/r\/cringeanarchy\n\n\/r\/physicalremoval\n\n\/r\/subofpeace\n\nEct\n\nOr any of the obvious ones. They also tend to have posts in conservative\/Trump subreddits, since thats another ground for them to recruit in. \n\nFascism is inherently against Libertarianism as a political philosophy.  Its important that fascist propaganda isn\u2019t all over the subreddit, so its up to the users to find it and call it out. \n\n\n\nEdit: another good one from \/u\/Juice2092 : Also a way to tell them apart is when they get personally offended when you talk about fascism or nazis. Even if you don\u2019t mention anybody specifically.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"If r\/libertarian is to be a moderation free subreddit, then the users have to get better a spotting crypto fascists."}

To resolve the uncertainty, an adequately powered publicly-funded randomised, placebo-controlled trial run over several seasons should be  undertaken.\"***  \n \n\n# Why do we hear non-stop that \"the  science is settled\" on vaccines? \n\nThis review\u00a0looked at evidence from experimental and non-experimental studies carried out over **40 years of influenza vaccination, including 75 studies**.  And yet still they conclude that an adequately powered and publicly-funded (read: independent, non-industry influenced study) RCT of sufficient duration has yet to be performed.\u00a0\n\n**What is even more disconcerting** is that only one CDR validated safety study on inactivated flu vaccines has been performed in children under 2 (the population most susceptible to adverse reactions), even though **in the USA and Canada current guidelines recommend the vaccination of healthy children from six months old.**\u00a0\n\nIn 2009 the World Health Organization found the receipt of the seasonal  flu vaccine among Canadians actually *increased* the rate of medically attended pandemic H1N1 infection. Vaccines, therefore, may actually *decrease* resistance to viral infection via their immunosuppressive actions. [View study.](http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20386731)\n\n# Can Vaccination Replace Natural Immunity?\n\nEquating vaccination with bona fide immunity, or calling vaccines  'immunizations,' is highly misleading, and as you can see by the Cochrane data above, **not evidence-based at all.**\u00a0\n\nThe vaccination process artificially simulates and co-opts a natural process, generating a broad range of adverse unintended consequences, many of which have been [**documented here**](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/anti-therapeutic-action\/vaccination-all).  Vaccine proponents would have us believe that natural immunity is inferior to synthetic immunity, and should be replaced by the latter, going so far as to suggest [breastfeeding should be delayed during immunizations](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/article\/vaccination-proponents-have-suggested-breastfeeding-should-be-delayed-order-prevent-immune-f) because it \"interferes\" with the vaccine efficacy.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis warped perspective follows from the disingenuous standard vaccine researchers use to \"prove\" the \"efficacy\" of their vaccines. The *chemical kitchen sink* is thrown at the immune system in order to conserve the expensive-to-produce antigen and to generate a more intense immune response - a process, not unlike what happens when you kick a beehive. These chemicals include \n\n\\-Detergents\n\nAnti-freeze\n\n\\-Heavy  metals\n\n\\-Xenotrophic [retroviruses](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/keyword\/vaccine-contamination)\n\n\\-DNA from aborted human fetuses ([diploid cells](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/keyword\/diploid-cell-vaccines)) and other species. \n\nAmazingly, vaccine researchers and  manufacturers do not have to prove the antibodies actually have affinity with the antigens they are marketed to protect us against, i.e. they do not have to prove real world \"effectiveness,\" only a surrogate marker of \"efficacy.\"\u00a0 \n\nYet, recent research indicates in some cases [**no antibodies are required for immunity**](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/blog\/study-disproves-cdcs-primary-justification-vaccination) **against some viruses,** running diametrically opposed to the orthodox tenets of classical vaccinology.\n\nAnother point that can not be understated is that the trivalent  (3-strain) influenza vaccines are incapable of protecting us against the  wide range of pathogens which produce influenza-like illness:\u00a0\n\n&gt;***\"Over 200 viruses cause influenza and influenza-like illness which produce the same symptoms (fever, headache, aches and pains, cough and runny noses). Without laboratory tests, doctors cannot tell the two illnesses apart. Both last for days and rarely lead to death or serious illness. At best, vaccines might be effective against only Influenza A and B, which represent  about 10% of all circulating viruses.\"*** (Source: [Cochrane Summaries)](http:\/\/summaries.cochrane.org\/CD001269\/vaccines-to-prevent-influenza-in-healthy-adults).  \n \n\nSupport of the immune system, then, becomes the most logical and reasonable solution.\n\n# It is not a lack of a vaccination that causes infection, rather, the inability of the immune system to function effectively. \n\n**Our immune status determines susceptibility.** If the immune system is continually challenged with environmental toxicants, nutritional deficiencies and\/or incompatibilities, chronic  stress, influenza is far more likely to take hold.\n\nIf your immune system is strong, many infectious challenges occur, are met with an appropriate response, and often go unnoticed. In other words,\n\nMoreover, there is an ever-growing appreciation within the scientific community that influenza can not be defined as a completely exterior vector of morbidity and mortality, as portrayed within the mainstream, but is actually comprised of many proteins and lipids derived from the host it occupies, and may even be more [accurately described](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/blog\/why-only-thing-influenza-may-kill-germ-theory) as a **hijacked cellular microvessicle (**[exosome](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/blog\/profound-implications-virome-human-health-and-autoimmunity)**)**, i.e. it's as much *us* as other.\n\n# Alternative Treatments \n\nAdditionally, while there are a [broad spectrum of natural substances](http:\/\/www.greenmedinfo.com\/disease\/influenza-0) which have been studied for their anti-influenza properties, vitamin D3 deserves special consideration due to the fact that it is indispensable to produce antiviral peptides (e.g. cathelicidin) within the immune system, and can be supported for pennies a day.\n\nFor instance,[ a\u00a0study ](http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20219962) published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2010,  revealed that children receiving 1200 IUs of vitamin D a day were at 59%  reduced risk for contracting seasonal Influenza A infection. Moreover as a secondary outcome, only 2 children in the treatment group versus 12 for the control group, experienced an asthma attack.

{"author":"IrredeemablyWhite","created_utc":1534211008,"num_comments":17,"score":1,"selftext":"Please note: this criticism isn\u2019t aimed at consequentialist libertarians.\n\nThe non-aggression principle doesn't serve as a convincing, or useful, foundation for libertarian policy prescriptions. At best, it's dubious as a moral precept. One of the chief reasons many non-libertarians view libertarians as being rigid and cranky, frankly, stems from your total devotion to this principle -- a principle wholly lacking in logical, empirical and philosophical merit. There seems to be an assumption that the NAP is true and carries weight outside of libertarian circles; it isn't and doesn't.\n\nMoving onto some basic general questions. Why should anyone subscribe to the NAP? What are the reasons for embracing this moral principle over others? As an example, in what way is the NAP more persuasive or \u201ctrue\u201d than soft utilitarianism? Further, even if we accept the NAP as being true or valid in a descriptive sense, how does it follow that one ought to observe it in a consistent manner?\n\nWhen libertarians talk about the NAP, most of you appear to speak both descriptively and prescriptively. As for more precise questions:\n\nIn what way is the NAP valid? Why take it for granted that initiating force is always immoral? If this isn't an assumption, on what does this principle rest? How does one reach the conclusion that it is always and everywhere immoral to initiate force without playing around with definitions? What evidence is there for a moral force in the universe which conforms to this idea?\n\nPutting aside the descriptive issues, even if one accepts the NAP as persuasive or true, why follow this principle in one\u2019s daily affairs? Going further, why should the state integrate the NAP as its central operating principle? Why adhere the NAP consistently? Why be consistent at all times? Whether or not it's broadly true that universal adherence to this principle is necessary both morally and for the thing to work -- which isn't an argument for its use and is in fact a good critique as to its uselessness -- there are definitely times when initiating force works to an individual's or group's advantage.\n\nTo reiterate, above all, why should the state be structured around this principle in as consistent a manner as possible? Why should one commit himself, in an almost absolute fashion, to an axiom as simplistic and, at times, non-pragmatic as this?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The Non-Aggression Principle is Without Merit"}

On the contrary; it is our MORAL DUTY to practice it, so we may hasten the day where the powers that be renounce initiating violence against people for the mere act of uttering numbers.\n\nPiracy is **not theft** as you are not depriving anyone else; I can steal your car, I cannot steal your idea (insofar as you still have it).\n\nIntellectual \"property\" is a misnomer. See Richard Stallman's (founder of GNU) [excellent explanation.](https:\/\/www.gnu.org\/philosophy\/not-ipr.en.html)\n\nIntellectual property laws are meant to impose an artifical scarcity on ideas and numbers, enforced through the initiation of armed violence.\n\nThe claim \"intellectual property laws protect innovation\" is a lie. They are meant to protect multinational corporations *against* innovators.\n\nAnd *even if they did* protect innovators (which they don't), it would STILL be immoral for the State to initate violence against people who have done nothing but utter a bunch of numbers (information is another word for number in this day and age).\n\nSo TLDR *anyone who argues in favor of IP\/copyright laws* is on the wrong side of morality (and history), as they are advocating for violence to be initiated against fellow humans.\n\nIf people don't want others to be copying their content\/ideas\/numbers, they're perfectly free not to publish them or spell them out in the first place. They are **not** free however to molest me because it is inconvenient to their bottom line for me to discern or repeat those numbers.\n\nOne last thing is I'd like to link to [Libgen's letter of solidarity](http:\/\/custodians.online). \n\nFree the world, hack the planet.","subreddit":"Piracy","title":"On the Morality of Digital Piracy""num_comments":1,"score":3,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"On the Morality of Digital Piracy"}

At the same time I have some concerns considering that in Western societies there are entitlements and effectively it is very likely that if drugs were legalized the bill for the cost of legalization like unemployment and social aid as well as healthcare related aid would increase and be paid for by people who do not take drugs as they are more likely to add more value to society and pay more taxes. What I am trying to point at I guess is that as long as we live in societies with entitlements there is no strong libertarian case for legalization of drugs and vice versa, if people are made responsible for the financial wellbeing of others don't they also have a right to manage the choices of the people that receive the entitlements?

Living in Canada, I want to encourage our youth to embrace Canadian values and culture, so I am starting this group under the \"Junior Forest Wardens\" program.\n\nOne of the first pieces of feedback I heard is that, in order to run such a program, I must first obligate every adult program volunteer to submit themselves to a criminal background check. While this doesn't seem to be the law, it is more or less obligated upon every youth program by precedent.\n\nI do not believe that mandatory Criminal Background Checks are in keeping with personal liberty, or the values enforced by our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I believe that it presumes guilt, denies free association, and violates the privacy of program members. It shouldn't matter that you got caught smoking weed when you were in your 20s, or that you had any other sort of police involvement in your life, so long as you don't have a history of abusing children. Presumably if the latter were the case, you're being monitored by the government anyways.\n\nThis being said, there are those who will inevitably demand that as program coordinator, I force this check on others. If I say no, I'll likely be accused of not sufficiently protecting children.\n\nWhat alternatives exist, which do not allow the government to exclude a large portion of our society from involvement in community programs? How can I communicate the value of these alternatives to parents and volunteers?\n\nI have considered simply making the checks voluntary, allowing parents to request the check results from individual volunteers, so that both parties can make that choice themselves, and accept personal responsibility for doing so.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How do I protect children in a way that also protects their liberty, and the liberty of community program volunteers?"}

I chimed in with a reminder that without capitalism, the drug in question (and many pharmaceuticals in general) would almost certainly not exist. Drugs research is a function of R&amp;D investments from pharmaceutical companies. Without proper financial incentives, they clearly wouldn't  conducting this research. This was, I thought, just an agreed-upon fact.\n\nI was banned (honestly I've been trying to get banned there for a while because I find the sub incredibly frustrating); the mods suggested it was because there was no evidence to support that capitalism had produced these innovations.\n\nI was under the impression that it was a given understanding that capitalism, for whatever faults you might ascribe it, promotes innovation. I didn't really think this was a debate.\n\nSo my question is this: Is what I mentioned actually a debate? Do most socialists genuinely feel that their political ambitions would support and advance innovation (compared to capitalism)?\n\nFrankly, as much as I love this sub, it can (on occasion and like any politically influenced sub) be a little bit of an echo chamber sometimes.\n\nI looking for true open-mindedness. Am I out of touch here? Am I biased in these economic beliefs? I understand and accept the implications of capitalism and free-market economies, I just personally think they benefits outway the negatives. But it didn't even occur to me that people would argue that capitalism isn't the main incentive for innovation. There is, I thought, pretty damning historical evidence that over time, socialist countries fall pretty far behind in terms of innovation.\n\nArticle in question: [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/socialism\/comments\/97nskd\/26\\_year\\_old\\_dies\\_from\\_rationing\\_insulin\\_due\\_to\/](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/socialism\/comments\/97nskd\/26_year_old_dies_from_rationing_insulin_due_to\/)\n\nTl;dr: I thought that it was universally accepted that socialism sacrifices (to some degree) innovation for perceived egalitarianism.

I would like to pass out flyers in all three of these cities to help get the word out about the gubernatorial candidate Bill Gelineau. In my parents' city I would like to additionally pass out flyers for the US House candidate Leonard Schwartz. \n\nNow as I have learned,   placing flyers in a mailbox is illegal. Putting flyers on people's windshields is NOT illegal but gets sticky if you're doing it on private property and they care enough to take action. Placing flyers on the outside of people's mailboxes is NOT illegal either. \n\nWith that being said,  in the interest of time I could put hundreds of flyers on the outside of mailboxes and on windshields very rapidly. However,  going door to door would take a LOT of time especially with people that would be willing to spend more than 30 seconds talking. In Ann Arbor I have the option of standing in the middle of campus with the other political campaigners (basically all socialists, and not an exaggeration, like campaigners for Ann Arbor's Socialist Party) and passing out the flyers to students that walk by. I fully plan on doing this a few hours a week once school starts but I'll also be significantly more busy once school starts. \n\nSo essentially my message is, is it effective to leave a very large quantity of flyers on the outside of mailboxes and windshields, or would I be better off going door to door passing out a small fraction of what I could pass out if I weren't going door to door?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"What is the most effective way to pass out flyers?"}

Taxes are used to help the poor, to pay for our military, and to build the roads. \n\n\n\nMe: No they aren't. \n\n\n\nSomeone: What do you mean \"no they aren't\"? \n\n\n\nMe: Taxes aren't used to fund government. \n\n\n\nSomeone: Well of course they are! What the hell are you talking about? \n\n\n\nMe: 100% of all tax revenue goes directly to the Federal Reserve system. It's a piece of the budget chart called \"interest on debt\". \n\n\n\nSomeone: You have to be stupid. There's no way that they can keep the military, roads, schools, infrastructure, and welfare going if they just gave all of the money to the Fed. \n\n\n\nMe: Oh no yes there is. Lol. \n\n\n\nSomeone: Well where they hell do they get the money from? Do they just pull it out of their ass? \n\n\n\nMe: Yes, actually they do. It's a process called \"Open Market Operations\". It's where 100% of all government revenue comes from. A group of big banks swap IOUs between the Fed and the Treasury, making a profit off of our national debt. It's also where all paper currency comes from. Taxes just come every April to pay the principal plus the interest. It's a multi-trillion dollar pyramid scheme. \n\n\n\nSomeone: You can't actually be serious about this. \n\n\n\nMe: No, I am serious. It's also where all currency that flows through Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and the War in Iraq come from. The Fed just collects the taxes after they whip up the cash in the hocus pocus open market operations scheme. \n\n\n\nSomeone: Well we need all of that to give liquidity to our government. Someone has to manage our nation's finances and someone needs to be in charge of the economy. \n\n\n\nMe: Do we *really* need all of that? People at the top are more than happy to help their country, but not this way. \n\n\n\n\nYou are being stolen from.

I spent the first 5 years living in low income housing never cooking my own food or ever putting in the effort to be a productive person. Then spent a majority of my time in government supported homes where it felt like just about all the folks that live there acted very limited, with no ambitions. I was in the worst state than most because all I mainly seemed to enjoy was sleeping because dreaming was the few things I liked to do. I agree with most of Ron Pauls beliefs,  but I didn\u2019t with his opinion on self reliance and self efficiency. Now I can see his views on this in A perspective where his ideas on this make more sense to me.\n\nWell a lot of looking in myself and finding a lot of books to read and opening up books that were sealed and impossible to open because of my own confirmation bias, and challenging my confirmation biases making hard to open books easy to open, I have become more of a believer of self reliance. I think anyone is capable of having self reliance, but yeah maybe give someone a push if they are in a wheelchair but I believe they can take themselves pretty far in that wheel chair. \n\nI think it\u2019s not the mind you\u2019re born with, but how you learn to use it.\n\nJust because you read a bunch of ways to be healthy and believe them doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to take the steps to move in that direction. People always come up with excuses and justify their stupidity.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to fully and truly care what\u2019s going on with the world and others when you are always in your own cluttered head instead of taking the many things the world has to offer.\n\nNow I have done a lot for myself and now think that 90% of people who act like they can\u2019t be self reliant in reality can be much more connected and get off the small world they live on and really take themselves in a direction of self reliance and being an actual productive and reliable person.\n\nI have a Reddit where I talk about how I went from hyposomnia always tired and interested in practically nothing, then ended up enjoying the interactions with more than 90 percent of the people I see daily, and conversations don\u2019t even get close to stagnant, and I enjoy doing more and have much more hobbies and interests.\n\nI am more interested in making the connections with people even many of the stubborn ones.\n\nI volunteer at the VA and dealing with people that are very kind and show an authentic appreciation for the help you provide them has been like a nutrient for me, and it has strengthened my heart and compassion. I felt like an old man in my twenties, now that I\u2019m thirty five, I feel like I am in my early twenties. My uber score even jumped from a 4.74 to a 4.87 in just a few months and I\u2019ve riden with uber over 200 times.\n\nI have overcome a lot of my adhd with learning how to function more effectively. I never forget what I was saying when I use to always do that, I can remember many more details of what is said in a conversation and can easily go back to the many things said in the conversation, I can hear better where I was so worried about it as a kid I always got my ears checked and even scoring perfect on the hearing tests, I am no where even near as easily distracted, I visualize better, remember long strings of numbers easier, and some of this was thanks to learning many mnemonic techniques and not questioning my ability to visualize, research and others things. I say people need to stop self distructing by limiting themselves.\n\nAnd for other symptoms I have that are one of the reasons I get benefits, I ended up convincing my doctor to stop making me take two prescriptions that are meant to help with serious mental health conditions, and then after not taking it for a few months, my doctors have said they see a positive change. My case worker sees me as a lot more self reliant and thinks living on my own away from the group homes(You know the place people recycle their minds at.

Though I don't condone the use of hard drugs for recreational purposes, it'd keep those who are addicted to them off the streets, and out of prison. It costs roughly 100k a year to keep somebody in prison, the fact that a government can throw a citizen into a cell and spend that much money on somebody for possession of drugs like marijuana, LSD, or Psilocybin Mushrooms is disgusting. Most people are aware that marijuana is harmless, though there's still a bit of a stigma surrounding psychedelic drugs. Acid and Shrooms are just as safe as weed, providing they're taken responsibly and in the right circumstances. Legalising Illicit Drugs would put the cartels out of business, eliminate the need for the DEA, decrease the prison population, and earn the government a lot of money should they decide to tax the sale of said drugs.

{"author":"Hippyer","created_utc":1534548329,"num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"There are two paradigms, one which views the state as legitimate and another which views it as illegitimate. In order to achieve a libertarian (ancap) society the popular opinion held within that society must view the state as illegitimate. My interest has been aroused to the topic of paradigm ranges after reading Hoppe. Hoppe says that the ranges of a legitimate state paradigm \"can range from active enthusiasm to passive resignation\", and alludes that a illegitimate state paradigm can range from 'open hostility to passive indignation'. Elsewhere he state's that 'politicians should be met with open contempt', and it is this idea of open contempt which I consider to be above open hostility in terms of range. \n\nI'm looking to open up a discussion on this topic and I'm curious if we can identify groups who we can place in a specific range of the legitimate state paradigm and discuss particular proselytising tactics\/topics which those group members are prone to be receptive to and also to which area on the illegitimate state paradigm they are likely to adopt initially and what we as libertarians can do to encourage adoption.\n\nI should note that I do believe that any such proselytising efforts we can make as libertarians are limited in effect and much adoption is achieved through introspect, but this is not to say that we should stand idle. Our actions are important.\n\nTurning our focus to the bottom end of each paradigm, we have passive resignation and passive indignation. It seems that here we have what I have termed, 'the little jump'. It strikes me as the most minute of changes of opinion which an individual may alter in order to switch paradigms. Can we identify any groups who we can confidently consider to be of a passive resignation mentality? Perhaps Libertarian Party voters in the US? UKIP or Tommy Robinson supporters in the UK? And if we can identify such a group how can we best persuade a resigned attitude to a indignant attitude? \n\nIf you have any thoughts I would appreciate it if you shared.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The Two Paradigms"}

I've thus compiled the most common concerns and attached my attempts at answering them, listed below in no particular order. The goal here isn't to convert everyone to my side, but perhaps to offer a better grasp of what social anarchism actually entails (even if only so you can be better equipped at arguing against it). If you don't care what other anarchists believe, this thread obviously isn't for you, so carry on.\n\n&gt; What is left-anarchism\/social anarchism, or more specifically how does it differ from anarcho-capitalism?\n\nWhile their adherents often differ greatly in terms of philosophy or psychology, in practice the only difference between these systems is a matter of which claims to ownership the society is willing to enforce and which it considers superfluous and thus ignores. While anarcho-capitalists are mostly comfortable with existing property norms (and many of them derive their anti-statism from nothing more than wanting to see these norms applied more consistently), social anarchism is an attempt at creating a new set of norms, intended to help effect an economic system wherein control of land, infrastructure, and capital is less entrenched in central authorities than at present. The way anarchists believe this might be achieved is if a society resolves to only enforce claims to ownership of land or infrastructure or capital that is being used or occupied by the claimant.  This means a merchant, artisan, or otherwise independent laborer would be able to own a small business if they chose to, but that they wouldn't be able to grow far beyond that point, say into being the owner of a thousand different retail stores that other people operate on their behalf.\n\nThere is still a need for large firms, however, in part because high-volume producers benefit so highly from economies of scale and in part because some tasks are complex and thus require input from a large number of people to be completed.  For this, anarchists typically imagine a system of economic democracy (which in many cases would probably more resemble economic federalism or republicanism).  I suspect there would still be de facto branding or franchises (though absent the traditional franchiser\u2013franchisee relationship) in the form of multiple firms that offer similar services choosing to operate under a shared name, despite being separate financially, if only for the benefits that strong brand recognition has to offer.  One might not even notice a difference in this respect from the standpoint of a consumer, as it would lie chiefly in the 'behind-the-scenes' relations between producers, namely with regards to which people are awarded profits for which economic activity.\n\n&gt; In this left-anarchist society, who would prevent people from engaging in capitalism?\n\nThis question seems to give capitalism a harmless definition like \"the ability to own things\" or \"free trade between consenting individuals,\" but anarchists typically define capitalism by the political hierarchy between \"the capitalists\" and \"the laborers,\" arising from the former holding the legal title to everything the social and economic life of the latter depends on. Still, capitalism is a hard term to define, which means claiming opposition to it often demands further explanation anyway, and some anarchists have moved away from that sort of rhetoric altogether because of this.  I personally prefer to claim that I favor the decentralization of economic power, which may or may not be how the person I'm speaking with defines it.\n\nAnyway, to answer the question more directly, we must first realize that no system of ownership exists *by default*, or *until suppressed*.  On the contrary, ownership\u2014even in the form of a personal possession\u2014exists only by suppressing behavior that contradicts it.  If there was no enforcement, no violence, no coercion, &amp;c., nobody would really be able to \"own\" anything at all.  The people in a left-anarchist society would be willing to enforce ownership of *some* things, but would choose not to enforce ownership of other things.  The same can actually be said of our current societies and even of an anarcho-capitalist society, as all of them have different ideas about what constitutes a \"legitimate\" claim.\n\nSo if a would-be capitalist tried to establish herself in this theoretical left-anarchist society, what difficulties might she face?  Those who ask this question likely imagine some sort of anti-capitalist police force that would arrest her for so much as trying, but the reality is far more benign: there would be a noticeable lack of people willing to accept the terms of her labor contract, and her attempt at controlling land and infrastructure she doesn't personally interact with (i.e. her attempts at expanding beyond the \"small business\" phase) would be handled in a way similar to if I were to randomly claim that my neighbor's house is mine despite their never relinquishing ownership of it\u2014i.e. her claim would be ignored, if not mocked.  If she tried to enforce it by her own means, against the will of the general society, *then* she may be treated as a criminal, but no sooner.\n\n&gt; If a left-anarchist society determines whether a claim is valid by whether it's being used or occupied, it has to have a standard for how frequently one must use or occupy something to maintain ownership of it, and which forms of interaction constitute use or occupancy. So isn't the application of that standard entirely subjective?\n\nIt would be subjective, but not any more so than the standard used by other ideologies. For example, anarcho-capitalists would need to decide what sort of interaction constitutes use or occupancy to satisfy their homesteading principle, and would presumably have some sort of limitation on how long somebody can stop using or occupying something completely before it becomes abandoned, both of which would be subjective standards.\n\n&gt; If I purchase something from somebody who agrees to sell it to me, how can my society choose to ignore the resulting claim?\n\nI answer this question with another question: why would an entire society be forced to respect an agreement between two people?  It should be recognized by now that ownership isn't a physical object that can be handed from one person to another, but a series of agreements between claimant and society\u2014i.e. the society agrees to legitimize any violence used in defense of that claim, and likely to help contribute to that violence if need be.  Why would we assume that because a society agrees to respect the claim of one person, it must also respect a claim (to that same resource) made by any future people of that first person's choosing? I can offer a simple comparison: if I agree to loan my lawnmower to a neighbor, does that imply that my neighbor can loan it to a third person, on my behalf?  That is, am I not allowed to say that I consent to my neighbor using it, but not to anybody else doing so?\n\n&gt; But if I sign a contract that says they agree to sell it to me, surely that would be enough to persuade them?\n\nContracts do have some power, yes, but they generally don't override the existing laws of the land. For example, it doesn't matter how many times I sign a contract specifying that my body is now the legal property of another person, because the existence of such a contract doesn't change the fact that slavery is illegal in my country.  If you're signing a contract with someone, it's your responsibility to know whether their terms are actually enforceable.\n\n---\nWith respect to the resulting economic systems:\n\n&gt; Some people are better than others at planning, making decisions, or leadership in general. Does this not demand some form of hierarchy in production, to ensure their talents are property utilized?\n\nThere are anarchists who describe themselves as anti-hierarchy, but with such a description they appeal to a particular understanding of the term that is seldom shared by their critics.  In short, anarchism is not a rejection of leadership *per se*, and if hierarchy is understood broadly to mean any one person being \"better than\" any other person, it's also not a rejection of hierarchy in general (though it does obviously reject a few particular forms of it).\n\nThe most important point here is that a person is capable of leading a group of other people without owning their land, infrastructure, equipment, and capital, and then threatening to take all of that away if they don't follow orders.  If a person within a firm demonstrates particularly strong decision-making prowess, she will no doubt be recognized by her peers, who will in turn be naturally interested in putting those talents to use.\n\nOur purpose is not to create organizational uniformity, wherein all people are considered \"equals\" just for the sake of being equals, but to allow people to form their own relations based on their own evaluation of the abilities of others rather than be subjected to the rule of whoever happens to control the relevant capital (which seldom coincides with actual ability).\n\n&gt; If these socialist organizations are run democratically in that the leaders are chosen by the people rather than through [some other means], does that mean what I've heard about democracy from anarcho-capitalist writers is relevant?\n\nNot necessarily, given their complaints about the democratic process seem to mostly be misplaced criticisms of the restrictions produced by contemporary institutions that just so happen to have some democratic elements to them (and which could likely be solved without changing their democratic nature).\n\nWhen multiple groups of people wish to share a political (or economic or social) agency, democracy is often going to be a practical way of operating that agency, but problems can arise if these groups aren't able to leave at some later time, say on deciding the cost of their cooperation and compromise is no longer justified by the benefits of unity.\n\nThe states we live under today (which are mainly what we think of on mention of 'democratic process') allow us to vote on which politicians come into power, but then also force people with radically different interests to share the same politicians, which creates all sorts of problems including but not limited to the alienation of minority groups (e.g. Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in Canada), but these aren't the problems of democratic processes so much as they are the problems of a lack of political freedom, or lack of freedom to unilateral disassociation.","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"A left-anarchist FAQ (for ancaps)""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"So I was browsing r\/Anarcho_Capitalism."}

I have a big problem here because that is a very broad term. What does it mean to \"get involved in politics\"? Is it one comment about abortion and you get taxed? In order to have something in place, this needs to be defined. As an example, I think it would be a problem if a church's funds were being donated to someone's campaign. That would be a conflict of interest. Also, there are many places and situations that shape people's political thoughts. Should we just tax everything that somehow influences our political thoughts? \n\nSecond. It's well known that colleges and universities indoctrinate students with left wing political ideas. It's not even a secret. Therefore, should universities be taxed? If you think that churches should not be involved in politics, and that pastors should not be on the pulpit talking politics, then we should say the same about college professors. Correct? I mean, the professors are there and they're supposed to teach. They are not being paid to push political ideas on their students. Again, let's push for consistency here.\n\nThird. How are you going to enforce this \"not getting involved in politics\" without monitoring what is being said in the sermons? Would this not be a violation of privacy?

These subsidies distort the market and lead us to eat more animal foods even as we're learning the [links between meat and diabetes](https:\/\/www.harvardmagazine.com\/2012\/01\/a-diabetes-link-to-meat) as well as the [links between meat and heart disease](https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/ije\/advance-article-abstract\/doi\/10.1093\/ije\/dyy030\/4924399?redirectedFrom=fulltext).\n\nThese subsidies comes at great cost. For one thing, it's paid for by our taxes. But there's more. Animal agriculture requires enormous inputs such as grains, soy and corn. Depending on the meat, it takes 10-20x more plant material to feed the livestock vs if we just ate plants ourselves for the same amount of calories. Furthermore, fields that grow this animal feed runoff into our bays and oceans creating deadzones. Ruminant animal agriculture is a leading cause of methane emissions, and animal agriculture accounts for up to 91% of deforestation (to create grazing land and to plant fields to raise the grain soy and corn that is used to feed livestock). \n\nI don't know about you, but I don't want my tax dollars subsidizing industries that are making us sick, and making our planet sick as well.  I'm not saying ban anything, I'm saying stop distorting the market that drives up consumption for a product that is exacting severe costs to our bodies, to our planet, and to our public funds. \n\nIf you also hate for your tax dollars to go to programs that distort the market so grotesquely, you can help hire a DC lobbyist to convince congress to [end federal subsidies to animal agriculture](https:\/\/www.lobbyists4good.org\/animal-ag-subsidies). If we can raise $5k, we get a DC lobbyist working on our behalf for a full month. \n\nHere's the direct url: [https:\/\/www.lobbyists4good.org\/animal-ag-subsidies](https:\/\/www.lobbyists4good.org\/animal-ag-subsidies) \n\nIn addition, please call your senators and reps and point them to this initiative and tell them, as their constituent, that you want an end to federal subsidies to animal agriculture too. (Maybe throw in that you want to end subsidies to big sugar while you're at it - that's a big market distorter too, but hey, one thing at a time). \n\nSo far, we've raised $616 for this campaign. Will you help us get to $5k?\n\n\\--- footnotes ---\n\n\\*$38B is the estimate in the book [Meatonomics by David Simon](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00CUUEY7I)\n\n\\*\\*see  'Forks Over Knives', 9:02 into the documentary","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Federal Subsidies to Animal Agriculture in the US are ~$38B a year.

{"author":"methegrey","created_utc":1534900016,"num_comments":7,"score":2,"selftext":"Francisco d\u2019Anconia's Money speech from Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. \n\nOne of the best works I've ever had the pleasure of reading.\n\n\u201cSo you think that money is the root of all evil?\u201d said Francisco d\u2019Anconia. \u201cHave you ever asked what is the root of money? Money is a tool of exchange, which can\u2019t exist unless there are goods produced and men able to produce them. Money is the material shape of the principle that men who wish to deal with one another must deal by trade and give value for value. Money is not the tool of the moochers, who claim your product by tears, or of the looters, who take it from you by force. Money is made possible only by the men who produce. Is this what you consider evil?\n\n\u201cWhen you accept money in payment for your effort, you do so only on the conviction that you will exchange it for the product of the effort of others. It is not the moochers or the looters who give value to money. Not an ocean of tears not all the guns in the world can transform those pieces of paper in your wallet into the bread you will need to survive tomorrow. Those pieces of paper, which should have been gold, are a token of honor\u2013your claim upon the energy of the men who produce. Your wallet is your statement of hope that somewhere in the world around you there are men who will not default on that moral principle which is the root of money, Is this what you consider evil?\n\n\u201cHave you ever looked for the root of production? Take a look at an electric generator and dare tell yourself that it was created by the muscular effort of unthinking brutes. Try to grow a seed of wheat without the knowledge left to you by men who had to discover it for the first time. Try to obtain your food by means of nothing but physical motions\u2013and you\u2019ll learn that man\u2019s mind is the root of all the goods produced and of all the wealth that has ever existed on earth.\n\n\u201cBut you say that money is made by the strong at the expense of the weak? What strength do you mean? It is not the strength of guns or muscles. Wealth is the product of man\u2019s capacity to think. Then is money made by the man who invents a motor at the expense of those who did not invent it? Is money made by the intelligent at the expense of the fools? By the able at the expense of the incompetent? By the ambitious at the expense of the lazy? Money is made\u2013before it can be looted or mooched\u2013made by the effort of every honest man, each to the extent of his ability. An honest man is one who knows that he can\u2019t consume more than he has produced.\u2019\n\n\u201cTo trade by means of money is the code of the men of good will. Money rests on the axiom that every man is the owner of his mind and his effort. Money allows no power to prescribe the value of your effort except the voluntary choice of the man who is willing to trade you his effort in return. Money permits you to obtain for your goods and your labor that which they are worth to the men who buy them, but no more. Money permits no deals except those to mutual benefit by the unforced judgment of the traders. Money demands of you the recognition that men must work for their own benefit, not for their own injury, for their gain, not their loss\u2013the recognition that they are not beasts of burden, born to carry the weight of your misery\u2013that you must offer them values, not wounds\u2013that the common bond among men is not the exchange of suffering, but the exchange of goods. Money demands that you sell, not your weakness to men\u2019s stupidity, but your talent to their reason; it demands that you buy, not the shoddiest they offer, but the best that your money can find. And when men live by trade\u2013with reason, not force, as their final arbiter\u2013it is the best product that wins, the best performance, the man of best judgment and highest ability\u2013and the degree of a man\u2019s productiveness is the degree of his reward. This is the code of existence whose tool and symbol is money. Is this what you consider evil?\n\n\u201cBut money is only a tool. It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as the driver. It will give you the means for the satisfaction of your desires, but it will not provide you with desires. Money is the scourge of the men who attempt to reverse the law of causality\u2013the men who seek to replace the mind by seizing the products of the mind.\n\n\u201cMoney will not purchase happiness for the man who has no concept of what he wants: money will not give him a code of values, if he\u2019s evaded the knowledge of what to value, and it will not provide him with a purpose, if he\u2019s evaded the choice of what to seek. Money will not buy intelligence for the fool, or admiration for the coward, or respect for the incompetent. The man who attempts to purchase the brains of his superiors to serve him, with his money replacing his judgment, ends up by becoming the victim of his inferiors. The men of intelligence desert him, but the cheats and the frauds come flocking to him, drawn by a law which he has not discovered: that no man may be smaller than his money. Is this the reason why you call it evil?\n\n\u201cOnly the man who does not need it, is fit to inherit wealth\u2013the man who would make his own fortune no matter where he started. If an heir is equal to his money, it serves him; if not, it destroys him. But you look on and you cry that money corrupted him. Did it? Or did he corrupt his money? Do not envy a worthless heir; his wealth is not yours and you would have done no better with it. Do not think that it should have been distributed among you; loading the world with fifty parasites instead of one, would not bring back the dead virtue which was the fortune. Money is a living power that dies without its root. Money will not serve the mind that cannot match it. Is this the reason why you call it evil?\n\n\u201cMoney is your means of survival. The verdict you pronounce upon the source of your livelihood is the verdict you pronounce upon your life. If the source is corrupt, you have damned your own existence. Did you get your money by fraud? By pandering to men\u2019s vices or men\u2019s stupidity? By catering to fools, in the hope of getting more than your ability deserves? By lowering your standards? By doing work you despise for purchasers you scorn? If so, then your money will not give you a moment\u2019s or a penny\u2019s worth of joy. Then all the things you buy will become, not a tribute to you, but a reproach; not an achievement, but a reminder of shame. Then you\u2019ll scream that money is evil. Evil, because it would not pinch-hit for your self-respect? Evil, because it would not let you enjoy your depravity? Is this the root of your hatred of money?\n\n\u201cMoney will always remain an effect and refuse to replace you as the cause. Money is the product of virtue, but it will not give you virtue and it will not redeem your vices. Money will not give you the unearned, neither in matter nor in spirit. Is this the root of your hatred of money?\n\n\u201cOr did you say it\u2019s the love of money that\u2019s the root of all evil? To love a thing is to know and love its nature. To love money is to know and love the fact that money is the creation of the best power within you, and your passkey to trade your effort for the effort of the best among men. It\u2019s the person who would sell his soul for a nickel, who is loudest in proclaiming his hatred of money\u2013and he has good reason to hate it. The lovers of money are willing to work for it. They know they are able to deserve it.\n\n\u201cLet me give you a tip on a clue to men\u2019s characters: the man who damns money has obtained it dishonorably; the man who respects it has earned it.\n\n\u201cRun for your life from any man who tells you that money is evil. That sentence is the leper\u2019s bell of an approaching looter. So long as men live together on earth and need means to deal with one another\u2013their only substitute, if they abandon money, is the muzzle of a gun.\n\n\u201cBut money demands of you the highest virtues, if you wish to make it or to keep it. Men who have no courage, pride or self-esteem, men who have no moral sense of their right to their money and are not willing to defend it as they defend their life, men who apologize for being rich\u2013will not remain rich for long. They are the natural bait for the swarms of looters that stay under rocks for centuries, but come crawling out at the first smell of a man who begs to be forgiven for the guilt of owning wealth. They will hasten to relieve him of the guilt\u2013and of his life, as he deserves.\n\n\u201cThen you will see the rise of the men of the double standard\u2013the men who live by force, yet count on those who live by trade to create the value of their looted money\u2013the men who are the hitchhikers of virtue. In a moral society, these are the criminals, and the statutes are written to protect you against them. But when a society establishes criminals-by-right and looters-by-law\u2013men who use force to seize the wealth of disarmed victims\u2013then money becomes its creators\u2019 avenger. Such looters believe it safe to rob defenseless men, once they\u2019ve passed a law to disarm them. But their loot becomes the magnet for other looters, who get it from them as they got it. Then the race goes, not to the ablest at production, but to those most ruthless at brutality. When force is the standard, the murderer wins over the pickpocket. And then that society vanishes, in a spread of ruins and slaughter.\n\n\u201cDo you wish to know whether that day is coming? Watch money. Money is the barometer of a society\u2019s virtue. When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsion\u2013when you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing\u2013when you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors\u2013when you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws don\u2019t protect you against them, but protect them against you\u2013when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice\u2013you may know that your society is doomed. Money is so noble a medium that is does not compete with guns and it does not make terms with brutality. It will not permit a country to survive as half-property, half-loot.\n\n\u201cWhenever destroyers appear among men, they start by destroying money, for money is men\u2019s protection and the base of a moral existence. Destroyers seize gold and leave to its owners a counterfeit pile of paper. This kills all objective standards and delivers men into the arbitrary power of an arbitrary setter of values. Gold was an objective value, an equivalent of wealth produced. Paper is a mortgage on wealth that does not exist, backed by a gun aimed at those who are expected to produce it. Paper is a check drawn by legal looters upon an account which is not theirs: upon the virtue of the victims. Watch for the day when it bounces, marked, \u2018Account overdrawn.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen you have made evil the means of survival, do not expect men to remain good. Do not expect them to stay moral and lose their lives for the purpose of becoming the fodder of the immoral. Do not expect them to produce, when production is punished and looting rewarded. Do not ask, \u2018Who is destroying the world? You are.\n\n\u201cYou stand in the midst of the greatest achievements of the greatest productive civilization and you wonder why it\u2019s crumbling around you, while you\u2019re damning its life-blood\u2013money. You look upon money as the savages did before you, and you wonder why the jungle is creeping back to the edge of your cities. Throughout men\u2019s history, money was always seized by looters of one brand or another, whose names changed, but whose method remained the same: to seize wealth by force and to keep the producers bound, demeaned, defamed, deprived of honor. That phrase about the evil of money, which you mouth with such righteous recklessness, comes from a time when wealth was produced by the labor of slaves\u2013slaves who repeated the motions once discovered by somebody\u2019s mind and left unimproved for centuries. So long as production was ruled by force, and wealth was obtained by conquest, there was little to conquer, Yet through all the centuries of stagnation and starvation, men exalted the looters, as aristocrats of the sword, as aristocrats of birth, as aristocrats of the bureau, and despised the producers, as slaves, as traders, as shopkeepers\u2013as industrialists.\n\n\u201cTo the glory of mankind, there was, for the first and only time in history, a country of money\u2013and I have no higher, more reverent tribute to pay to America, for this means: a country of reason, justice, freedom, production, achievement. For the first time, man\u2019s mind and money were set free, and there were no fortunes-by-conquest, but only fortunes-by-work, and instead of swordsmen and slaves, there appeared the real maker of wealth, the greatest worker, the highest type of human being\u2013the self-made man\u2013the American industrialist.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me to name the proudest distinction of Americans, I would choose\u2013because it contains all the others\u2013the fact that they were the people who created the phrase \u2018to make money.\u2019 No other language or nation had ever used these words before; men had always thought of wealth as a static quantity\u2013to be seized, begged, inherited, shared, looted or obtained as a favor. Americans were the first to understand that wealth has to be created. The words \u2018to make money\u2019 hold the essence of human morality.\n\n\u201cYet these were the words for which Americans were denounced by the rotted cultures of the looters\u2019 continents. Now the looters\u2019 credo has brought you to regard your proudest achievements as a hallmark of shame, your prosperity as guilt, your greatest men, the industrialists, as blackguards, and your magnificent factories as the product and property of muscular labor, the labor of whip-driven slaves, like the pyramids of Egypt. The rotter who simpers that he sees no difference between the power of the dollar and the power of the whip, ought to learn the difference on his own hide\u2013 as, I think, he will.\n\n\u201cUntil and unless you discover that money is the root of all good, you ask for your own destruction. When money ceases to be the tool by which men deal with one another, then men become the tools of men. Blood, whips and guns\u2013or dollars. Take your choice\u2013there is no other\u2013and your time is running out.\u201d","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"So you think that money is the root of all evil?"}

{"author":"rampitup55","created_utc":1534956520,"num_comments":12,"score":6,"selftext":"I consider myself to be largely libertarian. And thus, maybe this will be in the wrong sub reddit. (is this techically a sub reddit?) Maybe this is for the Anarchy sub. But maybe someone here can answer my question. The alex jones thing just raises this old question for me, once again. What do libertarians say about abuse from private entities? Maybe someone can also tell me what anarcho captialists think about this. \n\nI have yet to get any good explanation. Because if you take away the government's power to do anything about abuse from companies, well then all you have done is shift the source of the abuse, from one group of people, over to a different group of people. There's still abuse. Abuse which shouldn't be tolerated. But if there isn't any law enforcement agency which can act on your behalf, then what do you do? After all we wouldn't want to step on the rights of those companies either. Which I do agree with, but as we seen in the infowars situation, they all got together (or at the very least they hive minded) and ganged up on him. Which could very well end up driving him (or if not him, others) out of business. \n\nSo what about his rights not to be ganged up on? I guess he has his own website, and a lot of other resources, but we wouldn't be talking about this if what they did had no effect on him. Fact is it dramatically reduced his presence. But without getting into any of the details of that whole debacle, lets just focus on you and me. If you or I am taking abuse from some large corporation, at this point in time, there is the possibility that we can make them suffer for their crimes. It has happened plenty, and it will continue to happen plenty more. Some little guy sues because they broke the law, and now they get to pay him, and the government, millions upon millions of their hard earned dollars that you know they do NOT want to part with. But they have to, because they abused him. And someone bigger and badder than they are, is making them pay dearly for that abuse. Or not so dearly, but either way the little guy is well compensated for his woes. Which is all that really matters. \n\nThat is the way it is now. But if we removed the teeth from government or someday finally went full ancap, that is out the window. The only recourse left to the little guy, (that I can think of) would be to... well to go to war with the company. To one way or another, force them to rectify the situation. Either by killing all the top management, (and or) all the major shareholders and taking what he needed from their premises to recoup all of his costs. Basically, how do you avoid \"Might makes right\" becoming the defacto law of the land? If the company was mighty enough to abuse him and not suffer, they get to. If he's mighty enough (perhaps in skill set or number of friends) to massacre their top echelon, well then he gets to. This situation sounds really, really bad. \n\nI've never been able to get a straight answer out of anyone on this. And it can be argued that the same situation exists now, with the government. I can't argue against that. What I'd like to know, is how you avoid doing what the wack job liberals just did in california with the starbucks straws. They just hated those plastic straws. So now they have paper straws, in plastic wrappers. How would this be any different? ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How is this dealt with?"}

The argument is clear and makes sense \u2013 the government is taking property from you without your consent and using the threat of violence to ensure they get what they want.\n\nI would like to, however, open up a discussion on the practical implications of the idea of taxation being theft. I bring this to you in good faith and really just want to see what the major points of view on this sub are.  \n\nAssuming taxation is theft, and assuming theft should be illegal, taxation should be illegal.  Note: the key word here is \u201cshould.\u201d  I\u2019m not saying legality and morality are one in the same, I am saying that if you believe taxation is theft and that theft should be illegal, then taxation should be illegal.  To me, this logically follows, but maybe you can shine a light on why I am wrong to say this.\n\nIf taxation is illegal, and you believe that the government should not break the law, then the conclusion you should come to is that there should be no taxation whatsoever.   **If you are a libertarian who believes in no taxation whatsoever, then there is no problem with you saying taxation is theft.  Carry on.**\n\nHowever, things get fuzzy for those libertarians who, although they dislike taxes and advocate for substantially lower ones, still argue that there should be certain taxes here and there for essential services (such as the military).  **If you are one of these libertarians, then there is absolutely a problem with you saying taxation is theft.**\n\nYou have to then reconcile these ideas\n\n1. Taxation being theft\n2. Theft being illegal\n3. Certain taxes being necessary for services such as national defense\n\nThe only way to reconcile these ideas is to admit that the government is allowed to break the law, or operate above the law, when certain serious societal needs are at stake.  The problem there, though, is who defines what societal needs are serious enough to warrant the government to break the law?  Are there other ways to reconcile those ideas?  \n\nFinally, there are some that argue this: The power to levy taxes is outlined in the constitution.  Therefore it is technically legal, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t theft.\n\nThe problem with that is now you get into the idea of a social contract.  If it is outlined in the constitution, which was written by the people for the people to grant rights to the government, is that not essentially the definition of a social contract?  Therefore, there is in fact consent to give up some of your property in the form of taxes to be used towards the common good.\n\nWould love to hear what everyone thinks on the matter.

It's pretty bad. 100 people die.\n\nSome of these people have families. A few of them have no family or friends at all.\n\nThe insurance company compensates each life, with life insurance, and pays millions of damages to each family.\n\nBut, there are is a problem:\n\nA few people who don't have families, friends, or alternative points of contact - There doesn't seem to be a way to compensate these people's lives. There is no one to whom to pay for their lives. What should insurance do for these people?\n\nIt is later found out, the owner of the building used relatively cheap materials for the construction, and hence paid more for fire insurance.\n\nThe investigation concluded, if the owner were to have used more expensive construction materials, not only would fire insurance be cheaper, but there is a high chance much fewer people would have died.\n\nThe problem is that the owner never intended to indirectly kill these people.\n\nThe owner notes: \"I had no idea all these people would have died.\" If I knew this would happen, I would have used the more expensive construction materials.\n\nFor simplicity sake, let's say the owner gave millions of dollars to all people with friends\/families for compensation. We're left with the people without friends. No one to sue the owner on their behalf. How can these people be compensated? Actually, if no-one sues the owner on their behalf, does that mean the owner's off the hook? Should the government sue the the owner on their behalf? If so, how can the government decide how much money is enough for compensation? If jail time, how much time is enough? How do you make that decision?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Pricing life"}

{"author":"mattman119","created_utc":1535025733,"num_comments":35,"score":18,"selftext":"***(TL;DR at bottom)*** \n\nI assume most of us here are used to being the \"black sheep\" of political discussions, often drawing the ire of conservatives, liberals, and sometimes each other. The libertarian platform has never really entered the mainstream on a broad scale, although it's gaining *some* steam with the rise of authoritarianism on both the right and left. But the odds of it ever becoming a major political force still seem pretty slim.\n\nI think the problem is that we have continuously screamed \"FREEDOM\" as the basis of our ideology. While this is accurate - and a good basis to have - the greater public takes freedom for granted. Freedom isn't \"new,\" or \"fresh,\" or \"exciting,\" even as it is being slowly pulled out from under our feet (cue \"frog in a pot\" allegory). People are complacent about freedom, which is why people scoff at the reasoning behind the second amendment, or at any argument suggesting that the government has no right to regulate drugs. \n\nThe question, then, becomes: \"If the preservation of freedom is a weak narrative, what else can we do?\" Interestingly enough, I found the answer in a [Vox article](https:\/\/www.vox.com\/the-big-idea\/2018\/8\/16\/17698602\/socialism-capitalism-false-dichotomy-kevin-williamson-column-republican-ocasio-cortez) (no, really, bear with me). The author is clearly one of their more even-keeled contributors that tried to bridge the gap between unregulated capitalism and centrally-planned socialism.  His main argument that capitalism, while spurring innovation and creating opportunities, is also a system in which personal failure is a very real possibility. On the other hand, while socialism seeks to protect people from failure through public welfare, it is not efficient enough at generating wealth to do so, and ultimately collapses. The solution, then, is to use capitalism in a measured way to fund a welfare state, much like the countries of Scandinavia.\n\nFrom a principled standpoint, I disagree with that take. Scandinavian economies may be more supportive of small businesses than the United States (Denmark and Sweden both rank higher than the US in the [Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Index_of_Economic_Freedom)), but their high progressive tax system stifles the incentive to innovate, since innovation tends to lead to large personal wealth. I mean - and feel free to call me out on this if I'm wrong - outside of IKEA, Nokia, Volvo, and *maybe* Skagen, what real innovation is coming out of Scandinavia? But, in spite of all this, there was one passage in particular from that article  that caught my attention:\n\n&gt; The fact that capitalism also creates a steady stream of opportunities does not, by itself, make the risk of losing tolerable. If rough seas keep tossing folks overboard, and people are barely keeping their heads above water (\u201cJust keep paddling, Aunt Andrea!\u201d), it\u2019s not enough to be told that there\u2019s *usually* a boat to swim to. We\u2019re more willing to risk storm-tossed seas when the ship of state is bristling with lifeboats and manned by a competent crew. \n\nThe key word in that paragraph is *risk*, which, on a second read, actually appears all over that article. And the assessment of human behavior is pretty spot-on. People that are disillusioned with capitalism - the ones that (erroneously) claim rich people are born rich - aren't *really* upset that they don't have the same opportunities as those in the upper classes. They may think that's why they're upset, but it's not getting to the root of the issue - a deep-seated, subconscious fear of failure and a chronic tendency for risk-aversion. They're not jealous of others' wealth, per say, they're jealous of their ability to try and get rich while having a safety net to fall back on should they fail, in the form of well-off parents. They believe it's unfair that they don't have similar protections from failure and feel they deserve one. They might be arguing for a right to healthcare, or housing, or a \"living wage,\" but what they're *really* arguing for is a right to be free from failure.\n\nIn this sense, capitalism doesn't favor those born into privilege. It favors the bold, the ambitious, the risk-takers. **This is the pivot we should make with our message.** Libertarianism is the ideology of *taking risks* and the idea that it's okay to fail (most business owners do their first time around). Of course, this isn't a new thought. One of the most common pieces of advice from successful people is \"Take risks, and don't fear failure.\" Everyone here reading this probably internalized risk-taking so long ago they don't even consider what it might be like to be risk-averse.\n\nBut who is actually promoting that as a foundation to an ideology, as the central plank to a political platform? Who is out there campaigning that a better life is there for the taking if you're willing to seize it? And risk-taking has benefits beyond financial security. We could totally revamp our message as a complete *lifestyle* shift that will not only improve your relationship with your government, but also with other people and yourself. I'm sure this sounds unrealistic and pie-in-the-sky, but after decades of promoting \"freedom\" falling on deaf ears, what do we really have to lose?\n\n**TL;DR (as promised):** Promoting \"freedom,\" while noble, is a played-out narrative that nobody takes seriously anymore. We should alter our message to promote the benefits of risk-taking, which is the one behavior that capitalism truly rewards, as a means to achieve a better, more fulfilled life. The advocacy for free association would then follow as a complementary position.\n\n&amp;#x200B;","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I had a (minor) epiphany about how we might be able to improve our message"}

Imagine driving down the road or on the freeway with absolutely no idea what actions other drivers on the road will be taking at any given time. Imagine flagging down every nearby driver and explaining to them the turn you are about to make and finding out what turns they will be making so as to avoid each other. No one would get to where they would want to go if they got there at all.\n\nStop signs, Stop lights, painted lanes, and simple rules like 'right on red', \"don't cross double white lines\" help individuals complete their trips safely and quickly because they now have a set of assumptions about every OTHER individuals actions without the need to communicate. I'll stay in my lane, you stay in your lane, we don't crash. I'll stop when its red if you stop when its red and we don't crash. etc etc etc.\n\nThis loose framework ALSO provides individuals with the freedom to deviate from expectation at their own discretion. you are free to change lanes as needed. You are free to swerve to avoid something as needed. Your car is not physically hampered from running a stop sign or red light if somewhere someday there is a reason to do so.\n\nNow whether or not the State should fine\/ detain\/ arrest you for breaking the community assumptions is a different question (and the answer is no) Good laws can be of course corrupted by the State in the form of predatory speeding tickets, nonsensical parking bureaucracies and a whole slew of other State violations on the freedom of individuals.\n\nBut the idea posed by Hayek is that the 'Good' Laws are those that create a framework of assumptions to be used by individual actors to pursue their own ends more efficiently than if there were no framework. Thus your freedom to choose how to act is preserved and you can freely complete whatever ends you choose. Thus it is 'Good'\n\nTLDR: Good Laws let individuals anticipate each others actions within a complex system to help each of us to operate more effectively within that system. They do not limit freedom to choose how to act, only provide information as to how others will act. Like the lines on the freeway.\n\nWhat are some other 'Good' Laws?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"the 'Good' Laws"}

{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1535061324,"num_comments":1,"score":0,"selftext":"Hello.  Im fully aware of the implications of posting any info online even without identifying info, so Im usually not one to post or even comment anything lately so while this fluke is still going and I decide to do so I figure why not.\n\nThere is a lot I agree with as far as libertarian ideals go.  I would never want to force anyone to anything, or be violent in any way.  However, becoming disabled stuck quite a blow.  I believe if I werent properly cut down, I wold lean possibly toward \"I got mine\" type of thinking.  Where only the most capable survive, and to hell with anyone who cant totally protect themselves or earn money each day.\n\nMy biggest question is, why dont the majority of people who we actually share a lot of values be so willing to inflict harm by \"ending all government programs now!\"  There are plantly of deadbeats who dont care about their home, family, or community gaming the system.  Why though should their choices be the reason Id lose my ability to pay rent?  My check pays my landlord, goes into the pockets of local businesses, is used to buy he (mostly used and refurbished) goods that are made by people who need customers so they can continue to work?\n\nI am really, truly curious about this.  I understand the common retort is that the social security tax is theft.  Okay, I can see how one would think that without looking to the future where they MAY actually become disabled (minus the gag-inducing money printing by the powerful who choose to finance social programs not even by using the tax but by creating debt after spending all the *actual* social security revenue.)  \n\nThis is the reason I cant call myself libertarian.  It doesnt align.  I dont want the old and poor in the streets, I dont want people unable to buy food and medicine thereby collapsing their local economies.  How come people who hold these ideals are so quick to reject UBI?   \n\nWouldnt it make sense to \n1.  End all social security and lower income tax while taxing capital gains (because capital gains are, bluntly, money made on other peoples money.  its not money from hard work, its pure financialization, passive, nonprouctive income)\n2. Estabilsh one flat Universal Basic Income tax along with reforms not allowing the money to be spent on overseas empire building adventures or subsidies already wealthy corporations.\n3. Allow people who do not want to pay the tax to opt out, they can reject the tax and reject UBI therefore for life.\n\nI am not an advocate for socialism and communism whatsoever.  Populations govern, we need to decentralize as much as we can but one fair system which replaces 1000 terribly managed programs is not a welfare state.\n\nLetting people have dignity is not a welfare state.  If you really believe if only it werent for those damned people \"getting a check\" you are very poorly informed about where the waste is.  If you actually believe hey, screw someone like me, a fellow American, well wear it proudly I guess.  But dont hide your hatred for someone who.isnt like you under false concern about balanced budgets.\n\nAnd no, I dont want to privatize ss or UBI, because NOBODY wants the the same power structures as Facebook controlling their lives that way.  Giving the same authority to private companies as communists give government solves nothing.  Im no person to scream facism, but that, boy oh boy, is that facist.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"An Open Question To r\/libertarian"}

I should ask you this question: What is the fundamental role government has in society?\n\nI believe it covers several things:\n\n1)Police and the Legal System and to defend against crimes which has a victim.\n\n2)Military, to defend against enemies FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC.\n\n3)Infrastructure essential to peace and security and sanitation.\n\n\u200b\n\nThose are the top three things.  So I must ask you, does it make ANY SENSE whatsoever why the military budget is LITERALLY FUCKING LESS THAN 4% of total GDP?  I find this absurd and laughable.  If we want to see America exist as a country hundreds of thousands of years into the future, we better prepare to take needed steps to secure the existence of our country.   There are many countries out there that hate us, that would love to see our country burn.  Our military is severely under funded.  Military leaders overwhelmingly agree that more funding would be good.\n\n\u200b\n\nWe are seeing the rise of China, they present an existential threat to the United States.  Our security is intrinsically link to maximizing the number of democracies out there.  A country which worships a communist dictator is no friend of the US.  And they have plans to spread their system throughout Africa and rest of Asia.  We Americans should substantially increase our military budget to 10% of total GDP.\n\nMake whatever needed reforms to TPP and PASS IT and expand it to Africa to keep China in it's place.\n\n\u200b\n\nThis will not be cheap, if you account for both military and substantially increase infrustructure spending both foreign and domestic, but there is a way to fund this; DEREGULATE.

You know who is the same height and weight as our sexy god emperor? Arnold Schwarzenegger is. Nobody ever calls Arnold Schwarzenegger fat, because he only ran for governor, not president. I would say that Trump is actually more of a Chad than Arnold is because women are throwing themselves at him. Look at his current wife and his previous ones, and also look at all his mistresses, they are all smoking hot 10\/10s that could land any man they wanted, and they chose GOD EMPEROR TRUMP because Trump is a sexy muscular man that could beat Biden\u2019s commie ass easily. Trump is thicc, not fat. There is a difference and you stupid globehead pinkos better get that right! \n\nYou know what\u2019s funny? The same Libcucks that call Trump fat because of some bullshit BMI scale are always going on about body positivity and fat acceptance. They say that women like Amy Schumer are thicc rather than fat, even though she is legimately a landwhale with no muscle at all. That\u2019s the difference right there, libcucks only give women a pass when it comes to their weight, not men. If a woman is overweight on the BMI scale, libcucks will call women thicc when they are considered overweight by the BMI scale, but if it is a man they will call him fat. The thing these libcucks just don\u2019t get is that men are supposed to be heavier because men have more muscle then women do because MEN ARE BIOLOGICALLY DIFFERENT THAN WOMEN!!!! \n\nWomen are supposed to be thin because their bodies are built differently then men\u2019s are. Men are supposed to be thicc and muscular like Donald Trump, and women are supposed to be thin and sexy like Trump\u2019s wife and mistresses. I don\u2019t give a shit if that\u2019s politically incorrect because if I ever get into office I will throw all the libtards that call Trump fat and say I am sexist or racist for telling the politically incorrect conservative truth out of helicopters and drop them in volcanoes where they will burn to death! I will then go to the top of the volcano and start roasting marshmallows and camp there overnight.

In addition, the anarchistic upshot of the libertarian doctrine appealed to the countercultural left. For did not the illegitimacy state and the nonaggression axiom (that one shall not initiate or threaten to initiate physical force against others and their property) imply that everyone was at liberty to choose his very own nonaggressive lifestyle?\n\n&gt; Did this not imply that vulgarity, obscenity, profanity, drug use, promiscuity, pornography, prostitution, homosexuality, polygamy, pedophilia or any other conceivable perversity or abnormality, insofar as they were victimless crimes, were no offenses at all but perfectly normal and legitimate activities and lifestyles? Not surprisingly, then, from the outset the libertarian movement attracted an unusually high number of abnormal and perverse followers. Subsequently, the countercultural ambiance and multicultural-relativistic \"tolerance\" of the libertarian movement attracted even greater numbers of misfits, personal or professional failures, or plain losers. Murray Rothbard, in disgust, called them the \"nihilo-libertarians\" and identified them as the \"modal\" (typical and representative) libertarians. They fantasized of a society where everyone would be free to choose and cultivate whatever nonaggressive lifestyle, career, or character he wanted, and where, as a result of free-market economics, everyone could do so on an elevated level of general prosperity.\n\n&gt; Ironically, the movement that had set out to dismantle the state and restore private property and market economics was largely appropriated, and its appearance shaped, by the mental and emotional products of the welfare state: the new class of permanent adolescents.\n\n&gt; This intellectual combination could hardly end happily. Private property capitalism and egalitarian multiculturalism are as unlikely a combination as socialism and cultural conservatism. And in trying to combine what cannot be combined, much of the modem libertarian movement actually contributed to the further erosion of private property rights Gust as much of contemporary conservatism contributed to the erosion of families and traditional morals). What the countercultural libertarians failed to recognize, and what true libertarians cannot emphasize enough, is that the restoration of private property rights and laissez-faire economics implies a sharp and drastic increase in social discrimination and will swiftly eliminate most if not all of the multi-cultural-egalitarian life style experiments so close to the heart of left libertarians. In other words, libertarians must be radical and uncompromising conservatives.","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"Hans-Hermann Hoppe: \"Libertarians must be radical and uncompromising conservatives.\"""num_comments":25,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Hans-Hermann Hoppe: \"Libertarians must be radical and uncompromising conservatives.\""}

{"author":"Pariahdog119","created_utc":1535283619,"num_comments":69,"score":25,"selftext":"In a recent story, the Orlando Sentinel wrote about a local official who had quoted the libertarian-leaning former radio host Neal Boortz when he tweeted, \u201cname just ONE country that was improved in ANY WAY by the addition of more Muslims.\u201d\n\nThe answer is easy: The United States. This country is home to countless success stories of people who have escaped from political or religious authoritarianism, emigrated to a much freer country, and built better lives for themselves and their communities.\n\nShahpour Nejad and Reza Kalantari, for instance, came to the United States after fleeing Iran. They co-founded Pizza Guys in 1986, a chain that today provides delicious food from more than 60 West Coast locations. Another Iranian immigrant, Hamid Akhavan, has been the CEO of Unify and T-Mobile.\n\nFamed dancer, pop star, and television personality Paula Abdul is the daughter of an immigrant from Syria and Oscar-winning actor F. Murray Abraham is the son of a Syrian immigrant. One of the most successful entrepreneurs of all time, Apple cofounder Steve Jobs, was the son of a Muslim immigrant who also fled oppression in Syria.\n\nThese are only few examples of a story that has played out innumerable times, in cases both large and small. Immigrants come to the United States and fill needs, open businesses, raise families, and add their unique stories to a vibrant and diverse American culture.\n\nGive me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!\n\nIt\u2019s important not to let Boortz speak for Libertarians on this issue, because Libertarians ardently support freedom of migration. \u201cEconomic freedom demands the unrestricted movement of human as well as financial capital across national borders,\u201d the Libertarian Party platform states.\n\nBoortz appears to have a healthy skepticism of government power over the economy and some aspects of our personal lives, but like many conservatives he loses that skepticism when it comes to big government\u2019s oppressive border controls. The vast, vast, majority of immigrants make our lives better, not worse. They bring a vital work ethic and entrepreneurial spirit, expanding the economy and improving their communities.\n\nOn his now-defunct website, Boortz wrote, \u201cDon\u2019t believe anything you read on this web page or, for that matter, anything you hear on The Neal Boortz Show unless it is consistent with what you already know to be true, or unless you have taken the time to research the matter to prove its accuracy to your own satisfaction.\u201d\n\nThis apparent dedication to facts and research is admirable, but Boortz has not applied his own advice to the issue of immigration. The Cato Institute, a libertarian policy think tank, has published definitive research showing that immigrants commit crime at a lower rate than native-born Americans, are less likely to consume welfare benefits, and generally consume a lower value of welfare benefits when they do use such services. Immigrants, almost across the board, are a net value to the United States.\n\nLibertarians support free and open migration across borders. Whatever other good ideas he may have, Boortz is simply wrong when it comes to immigration.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.lp.org\/immigrants-benefit-the-united-states\/","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Immigrants benefit the United States"}

{"author":"jsmetalcore","created_utc":1535333388,"num_comments":16,"score":2,"selftext":"Just reading his wikipedia page, it seems like he supports authoritarianism and would be considered alt-right today.  He also wants to give the wealthy absolute power and allow them to control their own state. \nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murray_Rothbard#Opposition_to_war\n\n\"Rothbard called for the elimination of \"the entire 'civil rights' structure\" stating that it \"tramples on the property rights of every American\". He consistently favored repeal of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, including Title VII regarded employment discrimination[80] and called for overturning the Brown v. Board of Education decision on the grounds that forced integration of schools was aggressive.[81] In an essay called \"Right-wing Populism\", Rothbard proposed a set of measures to \"reach out\" to the \"middle and working classes\", which included urging the police to crack down on \"street criminals\", writing that \"cops must be unleashed\" and \"allowed to administer instant punishment, subject of course to liability when they are in error\". He also advocated that the police \"clear the streets of bums and vagrants\" and quipped \"who cares?\" in response to the question of where these people would go after being removed from public property.[82]\" \n\nanti-intellectualism \n\n\"Rothbard embraced \"historical revisionism\" as an antidote to what he perceived to be the dominant influence exerted by corrupt \"court intellectuals\" over mainstream historical narratives.[5](pp15, 62, 141)[100] Rothbard wrote that these mainstream intellectuals distorted the historical record in favor of \"the state\" in exchange for \"wealth, power, and prestige\" from the state.[5](p15) Rothbard characterized the revisionist task as \"penetrating the fog of lies and deception of the State and its Court Intellectuals, and to present to the public the true history\".[100] He was influenced by and called a champion of the historian Harry Elmer Barnes, a Holocaust denier.[100][101][102] Rothbard endorsed Barnes's revisionism on World War II, favorably citing his view that \"the murder of Germans and Japanese was the overriding aim of World War II\". In addition to broadly supporting his historical views, Rothbard promoted Barnes as an influence for future revisionists.[103]\"\n\n\"In the Ethics of Liberty, Rothbard explores issues regarding children's rights in terms of self-ownership and contract.[106] These include support for a woman's right to abortion, condemnation of parents showing aggression towards children and opposition to the state forcing parents to care for children. He also holds children have the right to run away from parents and seek new guardians as soon as they are able to choose to do so. He asserted that parents have the right to put a child out for adoption or sell the rights to the child in a voluntary contract in what Rothbard suggests will be a \"flourishing free market in children\". He believes that selling children as consumer goods in accord with market forces\u2014while \"superficially monstrous\"\u2014will benefit \"everyone\" involved in the market: \"the natural parents, the children, and the foster parents purchasing\".[107][108]\n\n\"In Rothbard's view of parenthood, \"the parent should not have a legal obligation to feed, clothe, or educate his children, since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights\".[107] Thus, Rothbard stated that parents should have the legal right to let any infant die by starvation and should be free to engage in other forms of child neglect. However, according to Rothbard, \"the purely free society will have a flourishing free market in children\". In a fully libertarian society, he wrote, \"the existence of a free baby market will bring such 'neglect' down to a minimum\".[107]\"\n\n\"In chapter twelve of Ethics,[113] Rothbard turns his attention to suspects arrested by the police.[109] He argues that police should be able to torture certain types of criminal suspects, including accused murderers, for information related to their alleged crime.\"\n\nsupport for slavery\n\n\"Rothbard's colleague Joseph Stromberg notes that Rothbard made two exceptions to his general condemnation of war: \"the American Revolution and the War for Southern Independence, as viewed from the Confederate side\".[91] Rothbard condemned the \"Northern war against slavery\", saying it was inspired by \"fanatical\" religious faith and characterized by \"a cheerful willingness to uproot institutions, to commit mayhem and mass murder, to plunder and loot and destroy, all in the name of high moral principle\".[92][93][94] He celebrated Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and other prominent Confederates as heroes while denouncing Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant and other Union leaders for \"open[ing] the Pandora's Box of genocide and the extermination of civilians\" in their war against the South.[95]\"\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How is Rothbard considered a libertarian?"}

It's an apolitical economic program that's been used by many right wing and conservative  governments for centuries to promote social stability. Welfare is much older than the theories of both capitalism and socialism.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe modern concept of welfare came from the conservative, imperialistic Prussians and Germans in the 19th century but welfare has existed for much longer. The Roman Empire made extensive use of welfare in the form of a grain dole for the plebeians (working class) and the Catholic Church had many welfare programs throughout the millennia. I even found references to welfare like food programs by the Hittites some 1600 years before the Romans. So I'd say welfare has probably existed in some form for almost as long as Human civilization has.\n\n\u200b\n\nI know that this is a economic right wing board but I would have hoped many people on here would know the difference between socialism and welfare. I know that right libertarians oppose taxation and welfare is funded by taxation, so it's not the opposition to welfare that bothers me. But if you conflate welfare with a far left ideology then how are you supposed to have a proper discussion about economic and social policy if so much is socialism and off limits to you?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why do so many people on here confuse welfare with socialism?"}

This will be cost neutral for the employer (edit: as in, it would not be more or less expensive for the company than traditional matching).\n\nEdit: the employer's match would go into the employee's 401k account.\n\nAccording to the article, employees with student loan debt accumulate 50% less wealth in their retirement plans (by age 30) than their peers without student loan debt. I think most of us with student debt have at one point or another felt \"behind\".\n\nThoughts? This is definitely a cool idea and would be a great hiring incentive\/perk.\n\nEdit 2: due to the popularity of this post, I wanted to remind everyone of some of the rules on our sub.\n\n&gt;We don't allow:\n \u2022 Moralizing issues\n \u2022 Petitions\n \u2022 Political discussions\n \u2022 Political baiting\n \u2022 Soapboxing\n\nThis is meant to be a discussion of personal finance, debt, and retirement savings, not a meta review of the pros and cons of capitalism. Please keep things on topic.\n\n\nEdit 3: Since a lot of people are confused, I'll explain how a 401k match works. A 401k is a retirement savings plan that came into popularity as pensions fell out of the mainstream. The 401k is a tax-efficient vehicle to invest your money for retirement. Like the pension, employers can contribite to their employees' 401k plans as a benefit. This is usually done via a matching mechanism: I contribute 4% of my paycheck, and my employer matches that amount. Matches are almost always capped.\n\nWith the method laid out in the article, you would be able to make qualified student loan payments and have your company match that amount as a contribution to your 401k, up to a certain amount. So say you make $2000 per month, your employer matches 5% of your 401k contributions, and your monthly minimum loan payment is $1000 (in this example, you have a lot of debt). You aren't contributing to your 401k currently. If your company chose to take advantage of this program, they would put $100 ($2000*0.05 match) in your 401k each month you made a payment on your student loan.\n\nThis doesn't \"hurt\" people without loans. This is only subsidized by the government insofaras the 401k is tax-sheltered (you still pay taxes on that money), and this doesn't constitute your company paying your loans. Participation isn't compulsory.","subreddit":"personalfinance","title":"IRS will allow employers to match their employees' student loan repayments""num_comments":2,"score":3,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"[THOUGHTS?] IRS will allow employers to match their employees' student loan repayments"}

Neither of us completed high school; we both have GEDs.  We both come from very financially and emotionally unstable backgrounds.  We have a lot of reasons\/excuses to fail in life.  And we did, for a while.\n\nThen we found plumbing.  My husband went through his apprenticeship first while I financially held down the fort (driving 18 wheelers, which is a great short term way to earn a good amount of money).  He still made between $12-15\/hr throughout his two year apprenticeship, which is a lot better than no dollars per hour, and now he is paid commission and nets about $60\/k year.  That is low for this company and he will make more as he gains confidence and experience.\n\nI have now decided to follow in his footsteps and got lucky with a $15\/hr position as a completely green apprentice.  As a female, it was VERY hard to break in with no previous labor experience, but I found a female-owned company that gave me a shot.  I'm 3 months in, 21 to go for my Tradesman license.\n\nSo, for now, we have a combined net income of about $85k\/year, and no debt of any kind.  Within two years, that income should rise to $120-$150k very realistically.  More is entirely possible as half the plumbers at the company we both currently work for bring home $90k or more.  Also, this is for service (residential) plumbing, not commercial or union.  You can make great money in both of those arenas as well (especially union if you're in a good state for it).\n\nI think that most states do not have a Tradesman license, so in that case, your apprenticeship would be 4 years to get your Journeyman.  I still think it would be well worth it for a lot of people.  \n\nI just thought I would make a post giving some people a first-hand, real world example of making it without a college degree or any student loan debt.  And the job prospects are fantastic.  There are no plumbers in my city that look for a job for more than a few days... and they have multiple offers to choose from.  The fact is that there are not enough plumbers to go around, and that is true of a lot of trades.  The job growth in plumbing over the next 20 years is double the national average.\n\nUnless you are disabled, there are no excuses.  And yes, ladies, you can do it, too.  I do.  I'm 5'1\" and weigh 118 lbs and I do it.  I have trouble helping lift water heaters into and out of attics, and the company tries to keep me off water heaters when possible, but I still do it.  Yes, it will be harder.  But no one ever got anywhere by whining about fairness or difficulty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI will try to answer questions if there are any.","subreddit":"personalfinance","title":"Why You Might Consider A Trade Over College (One Real-World Perspective)""num_comments":5,"score":5,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Nothing overtly political here, but a few libertarian themes really jumped out at me from this woman's experience."}

{"author":"Mild-GenderDysphoria","created_utc":1535759423,"num_comments":44,"score":0,"selftext":"Ok so I'm less angry today than I was yesterday.  I'm going to lay out an argument that someone can be both a White Nationalist and a Libertarian.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhite nationalism is the belief that the nation state and it's culture is based on the idea of having a high % of white people.  That you cannot replace whites and still retain the nation.  As white nationalists, we seek to address the pressing issues of white genocide by actively discouraging interracial marriages between whites and those we consider to be lower IQed.  We are mixed opinion when it comes down to east asians as they have great genes, I tend to be OK with whites and east asians marrying.  America is facing soft white genocide due to racial mixing.  Such behavior should be discouraged.\n\nAds glorifying mix race couples will be banned.  Instead, the government should advertise glorification of white couples only.  This law will be imposed on all states and counties that when it comes to government run or funded ads, Whites must be on the cover.\n\nWe support restrictions on low IQed races from gaining citizenship if they had been born out of the country and did not have a parent that was an American citizen.\n\nAmerica should prioritize helping white refugees from Ukraine and South Africa and prepare a military intervention in South Africa to stop the hot white genocide.\n\nI consider myself a libertarian as I support reducing taxes BY 50%, Reducing entitlement and making them more sustainable, an unpopular decision but SS will run out in 20 years without reforms. Over regulation is a huge issue. I am unconditionally for bodily autonomy, pharmacological, as well as cosmetic and transgender related healthcare.  What you and your doctor is your own business and not the business of the state SO LONG as you are an adult, or even an emancipated minor of the age of 16 and above.\n\nEnd the war on drugs will be part of respecting bodily autonomy.  Full out decriminalization of personal possession, legalization of sales of drugs harder than weed will be a case by case basis. I don't want RX Corp to for example sell fentynal for recreational use.  But would legalize and regulate safer alternatives.\n\nAny hard drugs that have been legalized for sales will be taxed in proportion to the amount needed to cover therapy and added cost of healthcare incurred from such drugs by the users.  I don't like the idea of denying drug addicts help even if it's their own fault, but I don't want to have to pay for their habits (whether that be jail, or for their rehab and healthcare), so a hefty tax will be imposed on all hard drugs, and yes that includes alcohol and cigarettes with the extra taxes tied to healthcare.\n\nIllegal drug trafficking should have sentences reduced unless they are linked to gangs that were involved in violence.\n\nI support the death penalty and would like it expanded.  This is not an authoritarian position.  If you disagree, post your arguments.\n\nI believe we should increase the penalty for pedophilia to mandatory life without parole.  When it becomes possible to go Clockwork Orange mental reprogramming, they will have the option through informed consent to accept mental reprogramming to cure their condition in exchange for a reduced sentence of 50-life.\n\nBecause statistically, whites have lower recidivism rates, significantly lighter sentencing will be in favored towards whites and east asians.\n\nI am UNCONDITIONALLY for free speech, free speech is under attack because of many social networks going after conservatives.  I can't begin to tell you how many times I've been banned from various platforms for hate speech.  I call for treating incorporated social media companies as utilities.  They should not be permitted to ban conservative voices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a libertarian, and I'm also a white nationalist.  I am both.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"White Nationalism and Libertarianism are not mutually exclusive, My argument:"}
