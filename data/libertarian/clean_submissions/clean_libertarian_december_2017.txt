Now while I understand both parties aren\u2019t really ideal I was wondering which party for the most part agrees with libertarian principles. In my personal experience it\u2019s been rather split. I feel as if right wingers tend to be more supportive of the free market, free speech and obviously gun laws. However many people on the left believe more in the legalization of drugs, or abortion and are generally more supportive of the separation of the state and the church. I also find that people on the left are less likely to be far left where as people in the right are more likely to be far right. That\u2019s why I\u2019m posing this question in general is the Republican Party or the Democratic Party more in line with libertarian ideology?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Current which major political part (Republicans or Democrats) is closer to libertarian political ideology"}

The bigger your market, Montag, the less you handle controversy, remember that! All the minor minor minorities with their navels to be kept clean. Authors, full of evil thoughts, lock up your typewriters. They did. Magazines became a nice blend of vanilla tapioca. Books, so the damned snobbish critics said, were dishwater. No wonder books stopped selling, the critics said. But the public, knowing what it wanted, spinning happily, let the comic-books survive. And the three-dimensional sex-magazines, of course. There you have it, Montag. It didn't come from the Government down. There was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship, to start with, no!

Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally 'bright,' did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasn't it this bright boy you selected for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was. We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made equal. Each man the image of every other; then all are happy, for there are no mountains to make them cower, to judge themselves against. So! A book is a loaded gun in the house next door. Burn it. Take the shot from the weapon. Breach man's mind. Who knows who might be the target of the well-read man? Me? I won't stomach them for a minute. And so when houses were finally fireproofed completely, all over the world (you were correct in your assumption the other night) there was no longer need of firemen for the old purposes.

But over the past month or so I've started to take more and more notice of it. Some of my friends are purchasing bitcoins and using them online. I personally don't understand much about it, and clearly, neither do a lot of Americans, because the search results for Bitcoin just surpassed the search results for [the POTUS](http://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-google-trump-2017-12). So I have a few questions:\n\n1) Just in general, how does this system work and how is its stability maintained?\n\n2) Being in the r/ModelUSGov sim, there are quite a few Keynesians and self-titled \"empiricists\" who say that the Bitcoin phenomenon is but a temporary trend, and that the rising values are due to fall. Is there any actual evidence of this, and if so, to what extent are those predictions true? Moreover, will Bitcoin actually become worthless?\n\n3) How will the prevalence of Bitcoin affect the way monetary policy works, specifically in America? Will it act similar to the stock market? Will it become used as a commodity like gold is during a recession? And finally, will this weaken, strengthen, or not have any impact on the federal reserve's fiat policies?\n\n4) Will Bitcoin be subject to inflation?\n\n5) Finally, Sarah Huckabee Sanders says that the U.S. Government is \"monitoring\" bitcoin. Do you think that President Trump is likely to consider regulating it? If so, how would this impact the way bitcoin is currently traded?\n\nI realize this is a lot of questions. You don't have to answer every one of them at once, but I'd appreciate some helpful responses.

{"author":"jsmetalcore","created_utc":1512350459,"num_comments":40,"score":0,"selftext":"There is a difference between Laissez Faire and the Free Market, but Laissez Faire is a failed economic system that didn't survive the industrial revolution. If we are using 19th century ideas for a 21st century economy, I have to ask does this make Communism relevant again? As it was also written by 19th century authors who wanted to abolish the state, classes, and money. \n\nI also understand that not all libertarians are Laissez Faire capitalists, just wanted to make that clear. \n\nBut to address Laissez Faire failures: \"Laissez-faire was a political as well as an economic doctrine. The pervading theory of the 19th century was that the individual, pursuing his own desired ends, would thereby achieve the best results for the society of which he was a part. The function of the state was to maintain order and security and to avoid interference with the initiative of the individual in pursuit of his own desired goals. But laissez-faire advocates nonetheless argued that government had an essential role in enforcing contracts as well as ensuring civil order.\n\nThe philosophy\u2019s popularity reached its peak around 1870. In the late 19th century the acute changes caused by industrial growth and the adoption of mass-production techniques proved the laissez-faire doctrine insufficient as a guiding philosophy. Although the original concept yielded to new theories that attracted wider support, the general philosophy still has its advocates.\" \nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/laissez-faire\n\n\"They believed in a bountiful nature and innate goodness of humankind, and asserted that governments should leave the individual alone except when social liberties are infringed. In 19th century, this philosophy became the dominant economic thinking in the Western world. But soon its failings reflected in the great disparity in distribution of wealth, harsh treatment of workers, disregard for consumer safety, and spread of monopolies, became clear. By the mid 19th century, opposition to laissez-faire economics began and governments in all industrialized countries intervened on behalf of workers and general population. Factory laws and consumer protection laws were enacted and growth of monopolies was checked. Early 20th century saw breakup of monopolies in the US and (after Second World War) nationalization of essential industries and services in Europe. Keynesian economics (which advocates government intervention in the national economy) further undermined it, a process spurred by the great depression of 1930s.\"\nhttp://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/laissez-faire-economics.html\n\n\"Unfortunately, an early effort to test laissez-faire theories did not go well. As an experiment in 1774, Turgot, Louis XVI's Controller-General of Finances, abolished all restraints on the heavily controlled grain industry, allowing imports and exports to operate as a free trade system. But when poor harvests caused scarcities, prices shot through the roof; merchants ended up hoarding supplies or selling grain in strategic areas, even outside the country for better profit, while thousands of French citizens starved. Riots ensued for several months. In the middle of 1775, order was restored \u2013 and with it, government controls over the grain market.\n\nDespite this inauspicious start, laissez-faire practices, developed further by such British economists as Smith and David Ricardo, ruled during the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th and early 19th century. And, as its detractors noted, it did result in unsafe working conditions and large wealth gaps. Only in the beginning of the 20th century did developed industrialized nations like the U.S. begin to implement significant government controls and regulations to protect workers from hazardous conditions and consumers from unfair business practices \u2013 though it\u2019s important to note that these policies were not intended to restrict business practices and competition.\"  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/laissezfaire.asp\n\nJust based upon Laissez Faire failures, Anarcho-Capitalism obviously isn't going to work. It's more of the right wing version of Communism (Other than Fascism, which is far-right). As it will never work in the real world and results in terrible conditions and huge wage gaps, but people still defend it.

The mere existence of a civilization creates disadvantages for those who would have been better off living in their native state with no societal controls. As such, we have a responsibility to ensure those born with immense advantage aren't given generational wealth that exacerbates their competitive opportunity. Even the famous industrialist, Carnegie, opposed large estates being passed on.\n\nYou can read Thomas Paine's paper on the subject below. \n\nhttps://www.ssa.gov/history/paine4.html","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Libertarian defense of the Estate Tax"}

{"author":"Know_Nothing_Bastard","created_utc":1512499328,"num_comments":10,"score":5,"selftext":"I began writing this in response to a post by u/freeturtlemarket about public land and national parks, but it sort of grew into an off the cuff mini essay on property rights, so I just made a new post for it. \n\nMany libertarians, myself included, believe that if an action is unjust when done by an individual, it is also unjust when done by the government. It would follow that the reverse is also true; since an individual can justly own property, so too can the government. However, just because government can justly own property, doesn't mean it has a right to any land it wants. Eminent domain is never acceptable under any circumstances. If a peaceful property owner is unwilling to part with their land for any price, it's tough shit for the government, regardless of what they wanted to use it for or how beneficial it might have been. Therefore, I think National Parks are okay, but mostly for areas that have unique natural beauty. Other than that, I don't think the government should own land it doesn't directly use, and I would grow suspicious if it could afford to do so in any case. But the same standard applies for private citizens. \n\nI think of property primarily as the combination of labor and nature, so I'm skeptical of a person's right to merely point at a piece of undeveloped land and claim it as their own. I think you should probably have to do something to the land to legitimately own it. That said, if someone wants to leave some land untouched for their own personal use (such as establish a National Park), I think they have a right to that too. So the trick is to determine what the limits should be. \n\nConsider the example of a vast, unclaimed forest. I think it unreasonable for one person to find it, and be able to claim for the whole thing for themselves off the bat, but they should certainly be welcome to at least some of it. Should they have claim to only as much land as they can develop? Should they have claim to as much as they can develop plus a buffer zone of undeveloped land? If so, how much? Who determines how much? Should they have claim to only as much as they can fence in? Should there be a limit to how much land one person can claim for their own, regardless of what he can develop? Or should the government own all unclaimed land within its borders by default, and require individuals to buy from them in order to claim ownership?\n\nThis complexity and subjectiveness behind the concept of ownership is why I'm not an anarchist. All I know is that a person has a right to justly acquired property and to do with it as they see fit. What's not so clear is how a person would go about justly acquiring unclaimed property, so I think a proper function of government would be to establish standards of ownership. However, once ownership is established the government should have no right to tax the property or otherwise interfere with it unless it is used to violate the rights of others. \n\nIn closing, fuck eminent domain.

Many of the cultural aspects of the site with regard to power-mods are my making.\n\nI took a break from the site for a month or two and came back.  The sentiments towards tyranny had increased, from about zero to a degree that was tangible.  I've since been trying to influence it again and I've been successful.  It is important that we not insulate ourselves otherwise other movement's more tyrannical givings will begin to express themselves.  When we encourage libertarian thinking, even among non-libertarians, the second dangerous and forceful solutions are advocated the bigger the wakeup call to those involved.  Me simply failing to do my job for a short while has had a noticeable impact on a very large number of people.\n\nSo what have I been doing lately to lay some influence into the site.  I'm just copying one pages worth of /r/libertarian to the site.\n\nI need others to copy what I'm doing with more sites, and more subreddits.  Libertarians don't get elected.  Our only job is to influence other movements.  If we aren't doing that we are utterly failing.\n\nPlease select one subreddit, and one site, and paste one page worth of content to your site daily, selecting only the content you think they will like.  It does more good than you think, and is not brigading.  It is simply sharing content that you legitimately think they will like that will sway whether a movement is violent or will follow the NAP.\n\nSites:\n\nVoat.co  \nGab.ai  \nMinds.com  \n8chan  \n4chan  \nRaddle  \nFunnyjunk\n\nSubverses (based on \"other discussions\" from the front page and size:\n\nAnarcho_Capitalism  \nGoldandBlack  \nLouderWithCrowder  \npaleolibertarian  \nLibertyForTheMasses  \nLibertarianPartyUSA  \ncryptocurrency\t\nLibertyTV  \n\nI only ask you to pick a combination so that we don't overlap.  You don't have to like the site you're posting to, or interact much with the users other than possibly responding to their views and sharing your own and asking them questions about their views to help them more fully think them out.\n\nIt can change a site from [this](https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/dsouza.jpg) to [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GN21riPP1Lo/maxresdefault.jpg) and [this](https://kek.gg/i/VhQM9.jpeg), simply by not acting.\n\n[Never forget this](https://kek.gg/i/3GJPm4.png) as motivation.  We only need to not act to have one of those less pleasant pictures.  We need to do this to both the right and left but I am less familiar with left leaning sites.  In some ways our failure to do this with the left has lead to their absolute acceptance of tyranny.   If you have more small sites ripe to be influenced and subreddits to use please let us know.  The less you do, but more consistently you do it, the more likely it is to be done with sufficiently frequency to prevent movements fully going off the rails.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Influencing other Movements"}

Also government literally can't accomplish anything. It not only stops wealth creation but destroys wealth. \n\nPeople have been saying this literally for centuries (Smith and Bastiat come to mind), but there is just too little understanding among the general public and too many vested interests for society as a whole to act on our understanding of free markets. (I feel like people look at free markets like they used to look at the theory of evolution...denial despite the abundance of evidence.)\n\nSo, we are basically in the same boat as the ancient Romans regarding economics and politics, except now we have iPhones.\n\nI don't like to be a pessimist but it seems that the US can only decline from here. Our current policies and taxes already look like Europe's. There is literally no sector untouched by the government, and many important sectors where it is way too present. (Medicine, education, etc.) Also, people are acting rationally and everything has become a game to avoid taxes and take advantage of the state instead of actually producing. I guess we are so relatively rich that there isn't much uproar/revolt about the amount of waste caused by big government, but maybe this will change.

Losing these deductions will, most likely, have one or both of the following effects on the real estate markets.\n\nIn high property tax states like NY, NJ and CA the $10,000 cap on property tax deductions will do little to help.  Property taxes in those states may far exceed $10,000.    For some, selling or losing their homes may be what comes next.  But, the demand for houses with high property taxes is likely to fall way down.  Fewer buyers.  Homeowners trapped.  Sound familiar?  It's kind of a flashback to the housing crash of 2008.  Maybe Steve Mnuchin \"The Foreclosure King\" Secretary of the Treasury will welcome this development, but most citizens won't.\n\nIn addition, State and Local Taxes (SALT) are not going to be allowed as deductions either.

Okay sure. An individual has got religious convictions, and as long as it's not directly hurting anyone, they have a right to be an asshole. You can't outlaw being a dick. \n\nBut how can a business do the same thing? I mean, it's not like a business can hold religious convictions... \n\nMoreover, taxpayers pay for the water, electricity, health inspections, R&amp;D into better crop yields, the public education which taught the workers to read and write, the roads used to transport goods, etc... The gay couple has been supporting that bakery for years! How can any one person claim sole ownership when they continue to accept the benefits of other's taxes? That doesn't make any sense... The gay couple has been propping up that bakery for decades. Yet they are refused service? \n\nI get how a whole bakery could refuse service, but only if every individual in that business personally denied to refuse service based on religious convictions, and did so individually. But how can a business as a whole deny service to gays based on religious convictions? I mean, it's not like a business can hold religious convictions. \n\nI just don't see how regulating a business interferes with personal liberties in this sense. \n\nYou can easily say \"a company cannot flat refuse service to gays\" while at the same time saying \"any individual who works in a business can refuse service to gays\". \n\nThose two things don't interfere... And in that case, the regulation of business in no way interferes with personal liberties. \n\n&gt;Well... the business accepts running water, electricity, uses roads to transport shit, uses crops that come from public water, R&amp;D that went into better crop yields, public education which trained the workers, health inspections\n\n&gt;The gay couple is partially paying to keep the business afloat and support it via basic taxable services, yet receives nothing in return. How can you claim sole ownership of a business when you still accept benefits which come from tax-payers?\n\n&gt; \"Small business sole proprietorships face the lowest average effective tax rate at 13.3 percent.\"\n\n&gt; That doesn't seem in any way that it monetarily balances out the massive expenses over decades and decades from which the businesses benefit...\n\n&gt; Not to mention the huge percentage of people who don't want their tax-payer money to go to companies which refuse services to blacks or gays..! I would argue that an incredibly conservative estimate of people who don't want their tax money supporting companies which refuse service to gays would be around 50%.\n\n&gt; So half of people don't want their money supporting this business, but the business still gets the benefits? Yet the company specifically refuses to serve a significant portion of those people who paid in? That seems like theft... \n\n&gt; They take something without the person wanted it to be taken, and then they give nothing in return. That sounds more like theft than taxes do in general...\n\nIt's a subtle but very significant difference in where money is sent to, whether people want their tax-payer money supporting various things, etc...","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Looking for some clarification regarding libertarian views on this whole bakery thing..."}

The levy was an additional 0.1 percentage point to the county sales tax (a rather substantial amount if you think about it), and the tax money would have gone to programs supporting primarily arts and cultural funding for poor and underserved public schoolchildren.\n\nWe had many heated arguments in the Seattle subreddit about this tax levy.  Most people were for it, and it was described to me as \"supporting critical programs\" that would enrich poor kids.  My reply was basically:\n\n* If you believe this is critical, then it's critical right now, whether or not this levy passes\n\n* You are also okay with paying $XYZ for this critical program, since you desire to be taxed\n\n* Ergo, you should be voluntarily donating money to this critical cause, so that the poor children get their arts funding\n\n* If the ballot passes, you can always stop donating and contribute through your sales tax\n\n* Here (and I posted links) are some charities that fund these critical programs today, you can donate with 2 clicks\n\nNeedless to say basically nobody agreed with this logic, somehow it had to be done through a tax on all of us, or else it wasn't worth their time to donate.\n\nThe levy failed, 51-49.\n\nFour months later, today, I posted in the sub to see if anyone who thought this critical program needed to be funded had gone ahead and upped their donations since the levy was shot down?  I mean after all, the poor kids need cultural enrichment.  The replies were fun.\n\n* One redditor wanted to raise his donations but couldn't afford it *(How would you have afforded the tax, buddy?)*\n\n* One redditor said they donate to planned parenthood *(A very worthwhile organization, but not supportive of the critical programs that underprivileged children need to learn about arts and culture, though)*\n\n* One redditor enthusiastically linked to 4 charities, but failed to acknowledge if they contributed or not \n\n* One redditor said it was none of my business\n\nSo, in a 12 hour period, not a single person on the subreddit has come forward to concretely state: Yes I believed the tax funded critical programs, and since the taxpayers did not fund them, I decided to myself.\n\nGuess those programs weren't as critical as we thought...","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Fun little taxation experiment in Seattle"}

I agree these people deserve to be named and shamed, but not because they believe in christian marriage. It has nothing to do with their personal religious beliefs when you peel it back. It has everything to do with that they think they are entitled to impose this view on others.\n\nVoting for the government to continue creating problems for voluntary, consenting adults is what's truly offensive here. In my opinion, it's the same issue as voting for a referendum stiffening penalties for drug crimes. You have every right to believe in and practice (and even advocate for) christian marriage, but you have no entitlement to force others how to live their lives. And just the same, you have every right to live anti-drug but you have no entitlement over what others do with their bodies.\n\nPeople are more offended that someone still believes in christian marriage without seeing that the actual problem is the arrogance and entitlement of telling others how to live their lives. But there's nothing wrong with believing in christian marriage if you live your own life that way and that's it. A \"yes\" vote never prohibited this. The referendum never included anti-discrimination ordinances, it was specifically scope-limited to expanding access to marriage. So if you're gonna be offended at a \"no\" vote for gay marriage, at least do it for the right reason. \n\nThe next time someone tells you it was okay to vote \"no\", go ahead and tell 'em it wasn't. Because while you're entitled to believe in and practice christian marriage, you're not entitled to use the government to create problems for people who aren't in your \"tribe\".","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Voting against gay marriage is just as offensive as voting against drug legalisation."}

{"author":"StaffSummarySheet","created_utc":1512679640,"num_comments":23,"score":2,"selftext":"If we look at the case of August Ames, the porn star who committed suicide recently, we can see a lot of important topics all exhibited in one story: freedom of speech, economic freedom, identity politics, and the dangers/benefits of sexual freedom.\n\nThe Rundown of the Story:\n\nAugust Ames was slated to do a sex scene with a man who had performed in gay porn and didn't want to do it. As a result, she was hounded on social media by gay men and advocates. After this, she killed herself.\n\n---\n\nThe one I want to focus on is the economic aspect of the story. If people view porn as a business and her sex with people on camera as her work, then her refusal to work with a man because of his sexuality (or at the very least his engagement in gay sex acts) can be seen as discriminating based on sexual orientation in the workplace. This completely clashes with the view that people have the right to be in total control of their own bodies with regard to sex acts.\n\nThis presents a dilemma for some people.\n\nImagine someone who defends the government's enforcement of the Civil Rights Act as it applies to private business for example. I think we've all heard someone say that it is not the government forcing you to do what you want to if you don't want to serve blacks yet they force you to do it anyway. A person holding such a view will typically say that you are not forced by the government because you can choose to provide no service at all.\n\nThat is, they think it is right for the government to tell you: \"Either serve everyone or you're not allowed to serve at all,\" and they think this is a reasonable statement. It kind of seems that way at a glance, too, unless you think it is wrong for the government to put such a stipulation on you when your violation of such a rule does not violate anyone's rights because no one has a right to your labor or goods.\n\nNow apply the same logic to the porn scenario. You are not allowed to have a preference to not want to have sex on camera with someone of a particular protected class if you are willing to have sex on camera with anyone.\n\nLet's say you're an Asian woman who wants to be in the porn industry, which is your right. Now let's imagine you were raped by a white man when you were a teen. Now the idea of sex with a man literally triggers PTSD (as in the real way, not the way that has become a meme). Too bad. If you want to be in the industry you have a right to be in, then you better be willing to have sex with a white man.\n\nI think this sort of thing is a little more unpalatable for folks than the idea of forcing a klansman to fix a black man's car. But what is the relevant difference?\n\nEither people will have to concede that sex is a special action with special considerations and that people should be fully in control of every aspect of it, including in industries of sex such as porn and prostitution (which would make the gays and gay advocates who bashed her so hard into the absolute villains of the story) or they will have to be on board with forcing sex industry workers to have sex with people they don't want, which is, in my personal opinion, pointing the government at the head of a sex industry worker and raping her.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why the reactions to the August Ames suicide are important"}

I used to do tech consulting for several medical practices. Mostly private practice doctors. One of my customers was a county health facility for people on Medicaid.\n\nOne day I was working in that county office and I noticed their waiting room had a CRT (old tube style) TV and about four very dated VHS tape movies. I let the manager know I\u2019d been putting in flat screen TV\u2019s in other offices and the old tube TV with 90\u2019s movies made the waiting room look dated and should be replaced. The rest of the lobby was in pretty shabby condition too but I didn\u2019t sell furniture so I let that be. They asked for a quote but never went through with the purchase. \n\nFast forward about seven years and nothing in the lobby had changed much. Then one day I showed up to pull some cable for an office remodel and the entire lobby was new. They got new furniture, carpet and put a TV on the wall. \n\nI asked the receptionist why they finally decided to spend money on the lobby. She said a few of the chairs literally fell apart with bigger patients sitting in them. Complaints had gotten to the public board after years of people griping. The public board eventually told the administration to modernize the lobby before someone got hurt. Keep in mind this was after nearly a decade of it looking shabby compared to most private medical offices. \n\nThat\u2019s when I realized how scary government run healthcare is. If you were on Medicaid and needed the particular service that place provided they were the only place you could go in the entire county. They didn\u2019t upgrade the TV because they didn\u2019t care what other offices had. They have no competition to care about. They didn\u2019t bother to care about the lobby until the condition of the furniture was an insurance liability. \n\nNo competition and a government mandated client base means they literally have zero incentive to care about the patient beyond whatever the legal minimum is. That\u2019s just a story about office furniture. Do you want to get your healthcare from a place like that? What\u2019s Medicare for all going to look like in the US?

Why on earth should we support it?  \n\nIf we are going to tax employees for training then why not tax everyone consistently based on these premises?\n\nIf someone's parents pay for their college education (or provide housing) why shouldn't the child be taxed on that as if it were income?  \n\nShould the scholarships of athletes be taxed as income?  \n\nWhat about the expenses of MiLB (minor league baseball) for MLB (major league baseball)?

Pending that repeal, participation in Social Security should be made voluntary.\u201d\n\u201cWe propose the abolition of the governmental Postal Service. The present system, in addition to being inefficient, encourages governmental surveillance of private correspondence.  Pending abolition, we call for an end to the monopoly system and for allowing free competition in all aspects of postal service.\u201d\n\u201cWe oppose all personal and corporate income taxation, including capital gains taxes.\u201d\n\u201cWe support the eventual repeal of all taxation.\u201d\n\u201cAs an interim measure, all criminal and civil sanctions against tax evasion should be terminated immediately.\u201d\n\u201cWe support repeal of all law which impede the ability of any person to find employment, such as minimum wage laws.\u201d\n\u201cWe advocate the complete separation of education and State.  Government schools lead to the indoctrination of children and interfere with the free choice of individuals. Government ownership, operation, regulation, and subsidy of schools and colleges should be ended.\u201d\n\u201cWe condemn compulsory education laws \u2026 and we call for the immediate repeal of such laws.\u201d\n\u201cWe support the repeal of all taxes on the income or property of private schools, whether profit or non-profit.\u201d\n\u201cWe support the abolition of the Environmental Protection Agency.\u201d\n\u201cWe support abolition of the Department of Energy.\u201d\n\u201cWe call for the dissolution of all government agencies concerned with transportation, including the Department of Transportation.\u201d\n\u201cWe demand the return of America's railroad system to private ownership. We call for the privatization of the public roads and national highway system.\u201d\n\u201cWe specifically oppose laws requiring an individual to buy or use so-called \"self-protection\" equipment such as safety belts, air bags, or crash helmets.\u201d\n\u201cWe advocate the abolition of the Federal Aviation Administration.\u201d\n\u201cWe advocate the abolition of the Food and Drug Administration.\u201d\n\u201cWe support an end to all subsidies for child-bearing built into our present laws, including all welfare plans and the provision of tax-supported services for children.\u201d\n\u201cWe oppose all government welfare, relief projects, and \u2018aid to the poor\u2019 programs. All these government programs are privacy-invading, paternalistic, demeaning, and inefficient. The proper source of help for such persons is the voluntary efforts of private groups and individuals.\u201d\n\u201cWe call for the privatization of the inland waterways, and of the distribution system that brings water to industry, agriculture and households.\u201d\n\u201cWe call for the repeal of the Occupational Safety and Health Act.\u201d\n\u201cWe call for the abolition of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\u201d\n\u201cWe support the repeal of all state usury laws.\u201d\n\n\n\nAlso - side questions. Do you think that there is a high likelihood that the content of many libertarian memes, etc comes from Koch money, given how much they spend on making their platform mainstream?

It just means I keep my shit and you keep yours and I only have a claim to your property if we enter in a contract that we both consented to or you broke my rights beforehand (stealing from me therefore I deserve a compensation).\n\nSince the government provides a service everyone should be taxed the cost that the government incurs in providing them the service individually, and so if the government provided equal services to all regardless of income we would have a flat tax for everyone (in nominal terms).\n\nHowever the government does not provide services to everyone equally, above [half the budget](https://media.nationalpriorities.org/uploads/total_spending_pie%2C__2015_enacted.png) goes to medicare, medicaid and social security. Welfare overwhelmingly goes to those worse off (that's what welfare is for).\n\nSo nominal taxes fall down as you get richer as you use less government services. This gets even more pronounced if we account for income - a flat nominal tax is a much greater % of someone of the low end of the income scale than of someone at the very high end.\n\n-----------------\n\nAnd so a \"Fair\" tax curve would mean the rich pay close to 0% tax while the lowest earners would be expected to pony up over 100% of their average income in order to have access to government services (and therefore stay in the country). Next time a politician hits you with the \"Fair\" buzzword think that if he was being honest that would be basically abolishing all taxes for top income earners.\n\n\n\nCompare it with the current US tax structure: The top 10% of earners (earning round $150k or more per year) have 43% of income yet pay 71% of taxes. So the 90% of people below them that control 67% of income just pay 29% of taxes and the lowest 47% of earners basically pay close to 0 income tax.\n\nThe only way of justifying higher taxes for the rich as being \"Fair\" is believing that the rich steal and don't create their wealth (which is false, if you don't steal or collude with government under capitalism you can only get rich if you provide a service people willingly pay you for) - so basically baseless Marxist class warfare crap.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"\"The Rich should Pay Their Fair Share\" - What it Means and What Fair is"}

One of the biggest complaints is that progression is rewarded not by merit and being the best player but by a fixed system that requires you to make additional puchases to progress. The point system negated basic gamer cultural ground rules for progression. Traditionally the \"merit based\" system would be based on amount of kills, kill death ratios, cooperation, objective accomplishments etc. This video as well as many others regarding EA's \"pay to play\" tactic I believe illustrates perfectly where capitalists and socialists fall into the same trap of \"game fixing\". Where merit based ethics are not abided by there are consequences. Interesting how players found a way to cheat an unfair and rigged point system as well as the all around consumer outcry.

Without FAFSA and other federal student aid programs, very few students would be able to attend my private university. Therefore federal aid is viewed as absolutely good/necessary and shouldn\u2019t be done away with. But, essentially at this point even private universities are subsidized because they can just keep raising their tuition and the government will cover the gap. \n\nAm I wrong in saying that if FAFSA etc. was done away with, college tuition would drop? My thinking is that once FAFSA disappeared, more students couldn\u2019t afford to attend college resulting in universities losing money from a lack of attendance. In order to stay in business, universities would have to lower tuition so that more students could afford the education. Am I overlooking something? I\u2019m not very knowledgeable in economics.

People will have to submit a count of their sexual encounters and submit a picture (bathroom selfie) with their tax return. Using a complex formula designed by expert Harvard economists and expert frat boys, each person will be rated for a sexual potential quotient (SPQ). There will be SPQ brackets of 1-7. If you are low SPQ of 1 you will not be taxed. If you are higher brackets then you will be taxed progressively. People with a 7 SPQ will be taxed 40 encounters a year. You can also receive a negative SPQ and this is how you would qualify for the Encounters for the Needy program. If you have zero sexual encounters or all your encounters are co-workers or people you hold power over you will definitely have a negative SPQ. If you are \"only a mother would begrudgingly love you\" unattractive you would definitely have a negative SPQ. Those who owe encounters will be encouraged to seek out those with negative SPQ on the new $40 billion Encounters exchange app. Social workers in the Treasury department will assign those entitled with encounters from the taxed in their area who do not get exchange offers. Surely a world devoid of sexual unfairness (no fugly troll left behind) will end all this acting out and the despicable practice of uncomfortable sexual encounters.

A grenade and atomic bomb very realistically physically threaten people around the vicinity of the objects.\"\n\nHe then responded, \"So, is this about the possibility of threat? Then libertarian police should arrest people who are drunk driving, texting while driving, and people with anger management issues or mental illnesses who possess firearms since they have a very real possibility of physically harming others or their property.\n\nI said that was a good point and said I should be able to respond after more thought.\n\nWhat should I have responded and/or what did I argue wrong?\n\nThanks a lot; I think this subreddit is really level-headed and a lovely place to have discourse.

{"author":"dog-boi","created_utc":1513267141,"num_comments":45,"score":0,"selftext":"Compromise is not a dirty word, it is the only way anyone accomplishes anything as a group.  And I believe it is a word that Libertarians should use more often in order to make meaningful changes and implement the parts of our personal liberty platform that are both useful and popular.  In doing so, we can flow like water around rock, cut the rocks off from their supply chain, and deal with them later - to paraphrase Sun Tzu.  \n\nWe all know that single payer healthcare is a shitty idea, but we are going to lose that fight.  And in the process of losing that fight we are going to make things worse for everybody.  \n\nI believe that in the interests of long term success and actually making the world a better place, Libertarians should be willing to temporarily embrace socialized medicine, and focus our agenda around the following issues - which we should hammer relentlessly.  \n\n1. Cut taxes\n2. Incentivize local markets\n3. Cut surveillance spending\n4. Cut Military spending and draw back foreign involvement\n5. De-militarize police forces\n6. Cut spending for the war on drugs\n7. Stop incarcerating non-violent Americans.  \n\nThere are more items on this list, but these 7 should be the main things that young people think about when the Libertarian brand is mentioned.  \n\nAnd to our advantage, these same opinions are held by the majority of young Americans.   \n\nThe brand is considered \"weak\" on healthcare and education, however, because we hold widely unpopular opinions.  And also because people are stupid and don't grasp that you can cut education spending and still be in favor of education.  \n\nFortunately, I think our stance on education will become more popular over time.  At the moment, young people are frustrated because their overpriced college degrees aren't making them any money, and they haven't connected the dots yet.  This will change as the market value of a degree becomes increasingly worthless, and eventually un-cool.  Until then, Libertarians should focus on other topics, and when questioned on education can simply twist the knife by relentlessly bashing the obvious flaws of $200,000 Liberal Arts degrees every time the topic comes up.  Painting college itself as the bad guy is technically wrong, but a pretty easy sell.  Marco Rubio did a damn good job of this in his Republican debates.  \n\nHealthcare is a tougher issue, however.  Because human mortality is a tough issue.  Everybody is going to die and we don't like to think about it.  We want to believe that somebody will do something to save us.  \n\nThe Libertarian approach to this issue is fucking IMPOSSIBLE to sell, especially to idealistic young stupid people.  I think that there are bigger fish to fry, and we would make more headway on important issues - like, not spying on our own civilians, bombing other countries' civilians and taxing the life out of our own businesses - if we just dropped the healthcare agenda and advocated socialized medicine in exchange for other budget compromises.  \n\nI think this could work for the following reasons:\n\n1.) In short, we would not be upsetting the status quo significantly.  The current health care system is not a free market system, and I believe it is worse than a socialized single payer system, simply because of the bullshit and red tape and stupid expenses being incurred, already, on top of simply not working well for anybody.  A truly free healthcare market would take years and years of misery to successfully introduce at this point, due to excessive government tampering and fuckery with the markets in the past.  We are in a similar predicament with the telecom infrastructure, and the short answer to both is that any attempt at a free market system would require the existing system to be burned to the ground first.   That solution would be nice in theory, but is fucking impossible to push as policy.  \n\n2) We can afford it.  Unlike paying for everyone's college, or paying for other people's wars, which are both very stupid ideas, paying for every citizen's health care is not fiscally impossible.  There are much worse things the government could be wasting their money on.  All current government medical budgets such as Medicaid can be rolled into the single system, and some legislation to protect individual doctors from malpractice law suits would help drive inflated prices lower.  I realize that it is a bad idea and doesn't work in the long run, but neither does our current system.  A strong economy will help offset the cost of this bad idea, and it will disprove itself over time as the quality of care drops off and private providers become more popular again.  \nAt this point, Libertarian candidates who are strong on economy and individual liberty will be in a good position to pivot and help usher in a better private system.  Until then, there is really no fucking point.  \n\n3) Effective policies in a few areas will provide positive proof that capitalism works.  Unlike theoretical Marxism, the whole world does not have to be capitalist for it to work.  It starts working whenever and wherever you apply it.  The problem with neocons cutting taxes, of course, is that they won't cut spending fucking anywhere.  The reason I am not just another Bernie supporter is that my end goal is still to introduce free markets everywhere.  I am just saying that if, in order to woo the current generation, we need to cut military spending and legalize weed first, but compromise on a couple of other issues - so be it!  Every little step helps, these initial policies will be successful, and the economy will improve because of it.  I would propose that freedom can act as a gateway drug to more freedom.  \n\nThoughts?\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Libertarians should concede on healthcare, pass on education and fight more important battles."}

I put a quarter in the radio to activate it. It was the chief.\n\n\u201cBad news, detective. We got a situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Is the mayor trying to ban trans fats again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWorse. Somebody just stole four hundred and forty-seven million dollars\u2019 worth of bitcoins.\u201d\n\nThe heroin needle practically fell out of my arm. \u201cWhat kind of monster would do something like that? Bitcoins are the ultimate currency: virtual, anonymous, stateless. They represent true economic freedom, not subject to arbitrary manipulation by any government. Do we have any leads?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet. But mark my words: we\u2019re going to figure out who did this and we\u2019re going to take them down \u2026 provided someone pays us a fair market rate to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy, chief,\u201d I said. \u201cAny rate the market offers is, by definition, fair.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re the best I got, Lisowski. Now you get out there and find those bitcoins.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m on it.\u201d\n\nI put a quarter in the siren. Ten minutes later, I was on the scene. It was a normal office building, strangled on all sides by public sidewalks. I hopped over them and went inside.\n\n\u201cHome Depot\u2122 Presents the Police!\u00ae\u201d I said, flashing my badge and my gun and a small picture of Ron Paul. \u201cNobody move unless you want to!\u201d They didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cNow, which one of you punks is going to pay me to investigate this crime?\u201d No one spoke up.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t you all understand that the protection of private property is the foundation of all personal liberty?\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t seem like they did.\n\n\u201cSeriously, guys. Without a strong economic motivator, I\u2019m just going to stand here and not solve this case. Cash is fine, but I prefer being paid in gold bullion or autographed Penn Jillette posters.\u201d\n\nNothing. These people were stonewalling me. It almost seemed like they didn\u2019t care that a fortune in computer money invented to buy drugs was missing.\n\nI figured I could wait them out. I lit several cigarettes indoors. A pregnant lady coughed, and I told her that secondhand smoke is a myth. Just then, a man in glasses made a break for it.\n\n\u201cSubway\u2122 Eat Fresh and Freeze, Scumbag!\u00ae\u201d I yelled.\n\nToo late. He was already out the front door. I went after him.\n\n\u201cStop right there!\u201d I yelled as I ran. He was faster than me because I always try to avoid stepping on public sidewalks. Our country needs a private-sidewalk voucher system, but, thanks to the incestuous interplay between our corrupt federal government and the public-sidewalk lobby, it will never happen.\n\nI was losing him. \u201cListen, I\u2019ll pay you to stop!\u201d I yelled. \u201cWhat would you consider an appropriate price point for stopping? I\u2019ll offer you a thirteenth of an ounce of gold and a gently worn \u2018Bob Barr \u201808\u2019 extra-large long-sleeved men\u2019s T-shirt!\u201d\n\nHe turned. In his hand was a revolver that the Constitution said he had every right to own. He fired at me and missed. I pulled my own gun, put a quarter in it, and fired back. The bullet lodged in a U.S.P.S. mailbox less than a foot from his head. I shot the mailbox again, on purpose.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right!\u201d the man yelled, throwing down his weapon. \u201cI give up, cop! I confess: I took the bitcoins.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019d you do it?\u201d I asked, as I slapped a pair of Oikos\u2122 Greek Yogurt Presents Handcuffs\u00ae on the guy.\n\n\u201cBecause I was afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfraid?\u201d\n\n\u201cAfraid of an economic future free from the pernicious meddling of central bankers,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a central banker.\u201d\n\nI wanted to coldcock the guy. Years ago, a central banker killed my partner. Instead, I shook my head.\n\n\u201cLet this be a message to all your central-banker friends out on the street,\u201d I said. \u201cNo matter how many bitcoins you steal, you\u2019ll never take away the dream of an open society based on the principles of personal and economic freedom.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, because he knew I was right.

I'm fairly certain that the FCC ruled it was entirely reasonable to claim ISPs as common carriers under Title II.  \n\nThis is where it gets interesting.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 ruled that ISPs were common carriers.  In 2002, Bush's FCC decided that ISPs were not common carriers.

And once again it appears that Reddit is being an alarmist echo chamber and it'll take some facts to take it out. \n\nSo when I first started researching this, I decided I would look to its passing into an official bill by the Obama administration. I had realized that no one mentioned it before, and by searching numerous subreddits by top of time only one wielded a result after about an hour of binging. I will get back to this later. First thing to know about this bill is that it was released largely in secret without the American people knowing. Ajit Pai would speak out against it saying you can't add more regulations without people knowing. Source: https://www.google.com/amp/www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-net-neutrality-fcc-ajit-pai-tom-wheeler-20150210-story,amp.html This of course brings up a huge issue with the picture they're trying to paint you.  If the internet was so broken before this, why was it released in secret instead of paraded around as the best bill ever passed? Surely if it was so broken people would've supported it. But no, not only did no one know, it was actively discouraged from being talked about to the point where it was a ban word on r/technology Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/22yewf/i_have_identified_a_list_of_keywords_that_are/ \n   Now we'll get into how it'll help the internet (but not fix it completely) As you have no doubt noticed the argument the left falls back on is that without it, companies will block throttle, and EVIL BIG CORPORATIONS! Before I start off I'd just like to ask them to show at least a little consistency as apparently Facebook and Google aren't counted as big corporations because they agree with them. But now we will get back to the point. As you have all seen in this sub,  a common argument we make is \"than another corporation will make millions providing a service that doesn't block and throttle\" to which they reply \"but there's only 1 in my area! It's a monopoly!\" Now I'd like the leftist to take a hard look in the mirror at themselves and think \"why is it a monopoly in so many areas\" Could it be that (gasp) perhaps when you have a law that makes all their products the exact same, there's no use for competition? As I said getting rid of NN won't fix the problem completely, and what will is many more efforts just like this to dismantle each and every internet regulation. So don't hide away at the mention of net neutrality, proudly say that you helped stop this and this is a step on the right direction to make the internet more free than it ever was.As it has always been, getting rid of regulation helps boat the consumer and the maker.\n Edit: sorry about bad grammar and formatting, doing this on mobile.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why repealing Net Neutrality is good."}

And I have to make a recurring observation: Left wingers are significantly more often not capable of leading detached philosophical discussions, also often referred to as dialectic or socratic dialogue; meaning discussions for the sake of insight and enlightenment. In a discussion like that the discussion partners take opposite positions that do not at all need to be their actual personal positions. They then give their best to prove the other wrong and themselves right.\nIdeally a discussion either ends with one position clearly defeated or alternatively it ends with the insight that the positions of the discussion partners depend on different axioms or premisses that cannot be proved or disproved themselves.\nEither way, at the end of the discussion there is a bit of enlightenment, either in form of having proved one position wrong and the other correct or in having realised that the two positions stem from different axioms/ premises.\nUnfortunately almost every time I argue with a right winger the discussion ends before that point with my partner insulting me and opting out of the dialogue. Obviously when I argue with right wingers I will socratically argue for left wing positions, but these are not necessarily my own, as when arguing with left wingers, I will argue right wing positions. However, left wingers do not so often opt out and call me names as right wingers do.\n\n\nI now wondered if you have observed this among yourselves and if you could think of a reason why so many of you are incapable of not getting emotionally involved in what is supposed to be a dialectic debate. Can you think of any reasons?\n\nThis is the main reason why I will never be a right winger. I share many views with right wingers but their attitude on culture and personal freedom and thought is not compatible with my socratic and free thinking being and I often perceive right wingers as prescriptivist and close minded, left wingers significantly less so.\n\nEdit: Oh and downvoting this post kind of further confirms my observations.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why do so many of you seem incapable of emotionally detached socratic dialogue?"}

I venture to suggest that such cases are more limited than is supposed but they unquestionably do arise. A simple example is perhaps the provision of telephone services within a community. I shall refer to such cases as \"technical\" monopoly.\n\n&gt; When technical conditions make a monopoly the natural outcome of competitive market forces, there are only three alternatives that seem available: private monopoly, public monopoly, or public regulation. All three are bad so we must choose among evils. Henry Simons, observing public regulation of monopoly in the United States, found the results so distasteful that he concluded public monopoly would be a lesser evil. Walter Eucken, a noted German liberal, observing public monopoly in German railroads, found the results so distasteful that he concluded public regulation would be a lesser evil. Having learned from both, I reluctantly conclude that, if tolerable, private monopoly may be the least of the evils...\n\n&gt;...The choice between the evils of private monopoly, public monopoly, and public regulation cannot, however, be made once and for all, independently of the factual circumstances. If the technical monopoly is of a service or commodity that is regarded as essential and if its monopoly power is sizable, even the short run effects of private unregulated monopoly may not be tolerable, and either public regulation or ownership may be a lesser evil.\n\nCapitalism and Freedom by Milton Friedman, pg. 31-32\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Milton Friedman on Natural (a.k.a.

Eventually the subject turns to what crimes they committed to end up in their predicament.  \n\nThe first prisoner says, \"I charged higher prices than everyone else and they accused me of profiteering and price gauging.\"\n\nThe second prisoner says, \"I charged lower prices than everyone else and thy accused me of predatory price cutting and cut-throat competition.\"\n\nThe third prisoner says, \"I charged the same prices as everyone else and they accused me of collusion and cartelization.\"\n\n\nIf You Can Define the Terms, I am a Monopolist\n\nPerhaps the most disgusting aspect of the mainstream economics profession is Antitrust and Monopoly Theory. You can't even say that it's \"Theory\" without getting a little bit nauseas.  Perhaps because their spectacular failures of the last decade, mainstream economics already suffers in your view.\nWell, you ain't seen nuthin' yet.\n\nMainstream economic treatment of Antitrust and Monopoly works like this:\n\nStep 1:  Developing an unrealistic, idealistic definition of competition.  Call it Perfect Competition.\n\nStep 2:  Judge every industry against your bogus definition.\n\nStep 3:  Take every industry and redefine the actual industry to make it narrow as possible.  If I am a cereal maker, I am no longer in the food industry.  I am not even in the breakfast food industry.  I am in the cereal industry, so they can exclude breakfast bars.  If they can, they'll put me in the cold cereal industry, to exclude oatmeals.\n\nStep 4:  Prostitute yourself to the newly empowered Antitrust regulators to testify as experts about how Company X in its narrowly defined industry no longer meets the made up definition of Perfect Competition.  Hope that no one comes along and points out that you defined all the terms.\n\nStep 5:  Collect the check.  Then campaign for more socialist reform.\n\n\nIf you think this formula is unrealistic, it's not.  That's actually what happened.  Mainstream economists defined all the terms.  Then they earned tremendous financial rewards by posing as 'experts' for antitrust lawyers (especially the ones hired by big business to crush competition, but we'll get back to that later.)  It was all about money, people.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  Mainstream economists served as intellectual prostitutes to destroy American businesses on behalf of their competition and an overzealous government.  They whored themselves out.  \n\n\nSo what is a real monopoly?\n\nA monopoly is any service where entry to competition is prevented by force.  If you can enter the field and are free-to-compete, it's not a monopoly.  If you are free-to-compete and lose, that alone does not make it a monopoly.  The other business is perhaps just better than you.\n\nExamples:\n\nIn New York City, there are many taxi companies.  But you can't drive your own taxi and offer rides to customers.  You will go to jail.  That's a monopoly.  You are prevented from competing by force.  It doesn't matter how many taxi companies are given this monopoly protection.  It's still a monopoly.\n\nHowever, if you have an industry dominated by one company, as in the case of ALCOA in the early 20th century, but you are free-to-compete with ALCOA, it's not a monopoly.  If you enter the industry and lose, guess what?  Tough breaks, kid.  They're better than you.

We don't. And in a free market, *without coercion*, businesses would be of a far smaller size on average, because their size is limited by *voluntary* consumer choice and competition. All large institutions generate corruption and waste. But large institutions are birthed by the use of coercive force and involuntary transactions. We should seek to prevent coercion, and it begins with preventing the government from handing out favors and interfering with voluntary contracts.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Rebuttal to PoliticalHumor joke about Libertarians liking to get screwed by big corporations"}

Unlike most presidential powers, this power, called [\"impoundment\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impoundment_of_appropriated_funds), allowed presidents to actually save taxpayers money on unnecessary spending.\n\nFirst used by Thomas Jefferson, impoundment has been used frequently by presidents since.\n\nThe only real downside to granting presidents this authority again is that they might use it to ignore the will of Congress. For example, a Democrat could refuse to spend money on military jets or a Republican could refuse to spend money on wind energy subsidies.\n\nIn order to mitigate this concern while still saving taxpayers' money, I propose that the president should be allowed to send taxpayers a refund of up to 1/4 of any programs' cost.\n\nThis refund would be allocated at the presidents' discretion, as long as no American gets a refund larger than their income tax bill. I imagine Democratic presidents would tend to send the money in equal amounts, while Republican presidents might use it to lower tax rates across the board.\n\nThis law could only lead to less government spending. And it would provide a tremendous incentive for the federal government to be run more efficiently. \n\nIt would also allow the president to eliminate pork barrel projects that make no sense, from bridges to nowhere to military bases the military doesn't want.\n\nEvery president would want to send as big of a refund check to Americans as possible. After one president sends Americans thousands of dollars of refunds throughout his term, the next will feel obligated to do the same, or else risk a backlash.\n\nEvery year around April a big topic of conversation would be how much money taxpayers are getting back because the president didn't spend it all. It would be an important factor in determining the presidents' job approval.\n\nSo what do you think? Would you support allowing presidents not to spend up to 1/4 of allocated funds?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Allow Presidents to Spend Less Money"}

It's run by the same corruptible beings as corporations, except they are publicly funded, can't fail like a business, and have the military to enforce their descisions. 2) even though I don't want to pay higher prices, the Internet service providers are the owners of the methods that provide us with service and should be allowed to operate their property as they see fit. 3) Having no \"starting floor\" for the amount of infastructure needed to provide Internet to people allows for smaller isp's to start up which would increase competition and the options for us consumers. 4) The Internet is not a right nor a utility, it is very helpful and makes modern life largely convenient, but it is not an integral part for a person to survive no matter how much some of these more dramatic people will decry so. I don't want to remove net neutrality because I love big corporations, in fact I think that the corporations wouldn't have made it thus far without the crutch of government subsidy. I want to remove it because I believe in the posibility of a largely stateless society where people are able to self dictate their lives, and where the government only exists to protect its citezen's property(including their persons) from harm and to uphold contracts made by consenting individuals. \n\nTL;DR government is largely uneeded and people are fully capable of controlling the market to their preferences.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I finally had to put my full though on net neutrality out there in response to a friend of mine, do you guy have any (non grammatical) critics?"}

These currencies cannot be devalued by central banks, and they provide individuals with more privacy and control in their transactions.\n\nThat said, the fiat money of central banks is at least, on the surface, \"stable\".  We obviously know about QE and the house of cards that the fiat dollar is based on, but it isn't going to change value from one day to another in a significant manner.  For a medium of exchange to be dependable and useful, it needs to hold a somewhat stable value.  How can you sell goods and services if the value of the currency is dropping 30% in a day?  Or rising 15% in 2 hours?  That's one problem I currently see with Bitcoin and other crypto.  Will it ever stabilize or will it always be this way?  Have other modern fiat currencies like the dollar or Euro gone through similar growing pains?  Or is crypto more similar to gold?\n\nIt just seems like bitcoin is more of an asset than a currency.  Who here is actually using it as a currency right now?  \n\nThere are 2 big issues with bitcoin that make is not useful as currency\n\n1.) Volatility in value\n\n2.) High fees for use.  Imagine if every time you wanted to withdraw cash from the ATM or use your credit card that you'd take a 6% hit.  My understanding is that Bitcoin Cash and other coins are trying to address this issue\n\nFinally, I know that there is a limit on the number of bitcoins that can be mined and that other coins allegedly have similar limits.

High taxes, regulations, and an increasing of entitlements are to credit for the prosperity. The rest of the developed world has been in ruin due to the biggest World war in human history with only America left to rebuild them, but that has nothing to do with it. \n\n**1970** - The rest of the world is back on their feet, and somehow America is in trouble, but it's not related. This is definitely *not* the end result, or fault, of the \"new deal\" too - which was awesome. Keynesian stimulation is at all time highs, unions have ultimate power, social spending is at records, and taxes are still astronomical, but everything is still the Republican's fault. We don't normally talk about the 70s except to remind you that Nixon was technically a Republican. \n\n**1980** - Shit is so bad we can't even spend our way out of it. This has certainly been caused by *greeeedy* businessmen and OPEC though. Reagan immediately makes it worse with Reaganomics. We're probably all doomed. \n\n**1986** - The economy ends up miraculously turning around but it still had nothing to do with Reagan or Reaganomics. It was the chair of the Federal Reserve's tight money policy and **only** the tight money policy. That chair was appointed by Carter, who was a Democrat, so remember that. \n\n\n**1997** - The Fed is now run by a Libertarian, and the economy is even better. This time economic policies don't take a decade to realize their full benefits though and the Federal Reserve can't have any credit either. This time it's all because of Clinton in the exact moment. Clinton is also solely responsible for the tech boom, despite having a Republican Congress. \n\n\n**2005** - The economy is still kicking ass even though there's a \"Republican\" president and a Libertarian is still chairing the Fed. This good fortune is just left over from Clinton though, and they deserve no credit.\n\n\n**2008** - The infinite benefits of Clinton have finally run out and the Market has crashed. This is 100% Bush's fault for \"reducing regulations\", even though derivative regulations that Clinton signed (Commodity futures modernization act of 2000) are still in place, and most experts believe it's because the government finally let a big bank fail which burst the housing bubble and caused a credit crunch. \n\n\n**2016** - Eight years later and appalling economic growth and record deficits under Democrats are still Bush's fault. Obama is just doing the best he can, and really it's not *that* bad guys, come on. Deficits are no big deal. \n\n\n**2017** - New country-wide nationalist movements have nothing to do with a century of progressive and PC failures, but it's simply because half of the country is racist.\n\n\nCongratulations.

So here's my 2 cents on the subject, anyone who would like to, feel free to contribute.\n\nNew Hampshire is a small state with a small population.  The population is around 1.3 million in the winter, and can balloon by 25% or so in the summer, our biggest tourist season.  The largest city has a population of under 200,000. The population is 96% caucasian, the majority remainder being asian, black, or hispanic.\n\nReligion exists but is not pervasive and usually not discussed.  We have an open-minded culture.  LGBTQ of all varieties are openly accepted, racism is low and not typically socially acceptable.  It still exists, mostly in the form of elderly people who don't know better.\n\nThe crime rate is always in the top 3 lowest in the nation (the other two being Maine and Vermont), despite the opioid epidemic being pretty pervasive.  \n\nWe're low on poverty, but also on infrastructure.  Outside of the major cities (Manchester, Nashua, Concord), public transportation is lacking and expensive, though if you're attending a college sometimes they have public transport that makes up for it.  Unless you live in a downtown area that's within walking distance of your job you definitely need a vehicle.  It's highly unlikely that you'll find anywhere that's within walking distance of everything you could possible need.  Taxiing is stupidly expensive, but we do have uber and lyft in certain areas..\n\nIt's small in size and that makes it easy to travel.  Nowhere in the state takes more than 5 or so hours to drive to, and the vast majority of anywhere most people want to go is within 3 hours.\n\nOur major industry is tourism of nature areas.  Our 13 (or 18, depending who you ask) miles of coastline is heavily vacationed in the summer, as well as our numerous lakes, camps, hiking trails, mountains, etc.  There's a lot of intact historical buildings, and lots of absolutely beautiful trails, fishing spots, canoeing, kayaking, etc.  There's skiing at all levels in the winter, and people come from far an wide to see our leaves in the fall.\n\nThough there's definitely a healthy amount of bars and the like in most places, there's otherwise not a lot of night life.  If you wanted to go clubbing you would likely have to drive in to the city.  There's not a wide variety of ethnic food in most places, but the seafood is excellent, and the food is getting better and more varied year after year.\n\nI'm particularly biased to the seacoast area, having grown up there.  It's populated, so there's basic amenities like a variety of grocery stores and malls and restaurants, but it's not overcrowded.  The best school system in the state is in Exeter, which is not on the ocean itself but borders Hampton, which is.  The seacoast area is also reasonably close to all the major cities in New Hampshire, as well as only an hour from Boston, one of the best medical cities in the world.  There's other regions (lakes, mountains, etc.) with a lot to offer, but for specifics I would turn to the other members of this sub that are more familiar with them.\n\nAll in all, New Hampshire is a beautiful, safe, place to live with a surprising amount of career opportunities.  It's a wonderful place to raise a family, with a relatively small, socially liberal, politically independent, accepting population.  True New Hampshire people are hardworking, inviting, trusting, salt of the Earth people.  Also, as a bonus, there's no state income or sales tax.  That does, however, mean that our property takes are a little high, but not outlandlishly so.\n\nI've decided to add a section about politics since it seems to be the most heavily debated subject I touched on.\n\nNH is politcally independent.  We have guns, a lot of them.  We have some social services, not a whole ton, but that's largely because there's not a big need for it.  But gay marriage and medicinal marijuana are legal.  Our governer is a republican, but the last several before him were democrats and we voted democratically in the last few presidential elections.  The most important thing to note is that we have a high number of registered independents because for the most part, we vote for candidates and not for parties.

From years of living here in Cali, I have pretty much think our government is only going to grow bigger. People kept talking about income inequality here, but what's really happening is opportunity inequality, California, alone with all its big metro areas, are descending into what a class based society look like. Kids born into the lower block of social economic ladder have zero chance of getting into the middle/upper middle class unless they are insanely lucky or have connections. Lower middle class people are leaving the states in droves, and the rich neo-liberal type here make up their cheap labor supplies by supporting immigration. Funny thing is, my family was one of those, we moved here about 15 years ago from our home country. The liberals here say they love immigrants and minorities, but in reality, they just like us but don't like the smell of us, they want us to populate the lowly paid service jobs they and their kids don't want to do. I actually felt a little vindicated when I got this job out of college, because I was like \"I ain't gonna server nobody\". If you go to LA, you will notice that people of different races and social economic classes are all living in their own block, very little interaction is there. \nBut why does all this have to do with me wanting to get a government job out here in the La La land? What I said above is what I think is causing, and is going to worsen the political standstill that is happening right now, the years I have been here, I have seen job opportunities getting smaller and smaller, while the government have always grow. Almost every middle class citizens who is doing good in LA that I have talk to have some sort of government jobs, while the ones working for private sector are all struggling some sort, unless they are like me who works in the tech sector, then they are making six figures salary. The rest? they belong to the service sector who works 9 hours a day for less than 20 bucks a hour and paying insane cost of living to do that. On top of that, a few years ago an accident hurt my back, and now I have a condition in my back that I have to carry with me for life, which will require good medical insurance policies for the rest of my life. While my current job does provide that, I am not sure if I can always have that privilege. There is a lady that I work with, who have worked for the federal govt here for 25 years before she quit that job, told me that she couldn't believe how shitty the benefits are outside of govt sector, and how much power her govt union had here in California over state politics and in generally forking resources their way. \n\nI honestly don't know how I will like that even if I plan to get one of those govt type of job as my mid career job. Software field is laden with money right now, obviously I am going to forgo some of my future earnings if I do go for a job like that. But what I worry about the most is will I be happy to sacrifice my belief of freedom to earn security like that? Being a life long bureaucrat here in California obviously meant I will have to work and be very liberal and politically correct at work and around people I work for, which I don't know if I can do that for a long time, but maybe time will change me. Yet I know I have to make this decision sooner than later, I want to jump ship when the field is hot, before the next tech crash so the demand is still on my side, it wouldn't be surprise once the tech sense crush and every software developer will want one of those government jobs. Right now most people in my field are chasing that cash without consider future prospects, GOP's tax cuts will heat up the economy at least in the short term, which means in the next 5 years, it's prime time for me to make my next career move.\n\nSo what can my fellow libertarians offer me here? Anyone know, or have personal experience working for the big brother? Please share your thoughts, thanks!\n\nTL,DR: A libertarian leaning software engineer with a medical condition wants to find a government job as his next career move, not sure if it's worth the sacrifice of my beliefs. Need advice and platitudes here.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"(Serious) Temptation to join the dark side...need advises and platitudes."}

Non selfish genes who try to sacrifice self to protect you are ceased to exist on the face of earth.

It is a term we used to describe how we fight for our life and body.\n\nNo life forms on earth is willing to be brainwashed to be slaves of slave-masters except human. They do not have -isms and/or -ligions to brainwash them to be slaves.\n\nAll other private properties are derivative of life and body private properties. They are extension of our original private properties. When we have surplus or needs and trade them with other private properties with mutual agreements(fair trades and fair contracts). This is also called fair mutually beneficial corporation.\n\nThis is all in our gene. Observe kids growing up. When they develop \"this is mime\" private property idea, we need to treat them fairly.

I posted this on another, less popular libertarian subreddit but this post never got any replies so I'm reposting it here simply for the sake of prompting discussion. I don't think my wording was particularly good and, looking back, some of the sentiments expressed are kinda iffy but I stand by what I said in a general sense. You guys seem really sensible. All the ancaps and libertarians I've seen genuinely seem like chill, rational people. Believe me, I wouldn't suck your goddamned dick if I didn't believe it. So, basically, please redpill me. I know the arguments are kinda weak but I'd like to see how people refute them (that is, if people decide to reply).\n\nHey, how's it going. I'm a social democrat, left-of-centre kind of guy. I'm fairly blue-pilled. If it weren't for the fact that the NHS was so successful and that both Britain in the '60s and '70s and Nordic countries (after the financial crash) implementing social democratic policies managed to do so well, I'd probably become a libertarian. I recognise the need for capitalism, agree with some aspects of Trump's tax plan and do think that some programs could easily be repealed (e.g art programs in America that are only promoting stagnation because there are artists now that are making things that genuinely don't appeal to anybody). On the other hand, in Scotland I feel that art programs regarding Gaelic (such as Creative Scotland) are necessary because they allow Gaelic (a minority language) to be respected and used in an at least somewhat mainstream context. Basically, in that case, Creative Scotland is helping the little guy. It may be funded by the government but its not the government handing over shekels so trust fund kids can make bottle cap sculptures. My questions are simply: Would you mind red-pilling me? Can Creative Scotland survive on its own as an independent for-profit body? The NHS may be being stretched but would privatising it mend the situation?

I\u2019m not a leftist, I\u2019m not from the right. I am a bit more \u201cmoderate\u201d when it comes to regulations and authority, but I can simpatize with libertarianism. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t think of myself as a libertarian, as a political ideology, but more of a philosophical guideline, as a principle.\n\nAnyways, that\u2019s not what this is about.\nI have always thought the income tax should be progressive, meaning that people who earn more money are taxed at a higher rate. Why? Well, basically because that\u2019s the default position and I\u2019ve never really considered another option. However,  I generally believe lower taxes are better. So basically, the rich should be taxed more than the poor, but all in all they must be taxed as little as possible.\n\nHowever, not too long ago, I stumbled upon the idea of the flat tax. I was amazed. Because it aligned with my principles. People must keep the money they earn, the government doesn\u2019t have the moral authority to steal it. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about it ever since but I just can\u2019t convince myself that fully implementing it is what ought to be done. I\u2019ve \u201ccompromised\u201d though. I think that the gap between the top and lower brackets must be as low as is possible. But still, not fully integrated. The reason for this, I think, is because the flow of money must always be from top to bottom, and it is unfair for a rich person to pay the same rate as someone who can\u2019t afford to eat. Why? Because, from a practical perspective, the government needs some money to help the poor through focalised, efficient and minimal assistance. And this money, if it doesn\u2019t come from the very top people (who to be fair could be perfectly fine with 5-10% less of their income), it\u2019s going to come from lenders and the government will accumulate debt and we can all agree that\u2019s bad.\n\nBut I like the idea of fully integrating it. I agree with it in virtually every philosophical and moral premise. I just don\u2019t find it a practical option. I just need that final push, that last notch to fully convince me. \n\nSo, this is where I ask you, libertarians, for help. Convince me.

{"author":"celticuki","created_utc":1514314939,"num_comments":5,"score":0,"selftext":"\nIn the Meditations, Marcus Aurelius advised his readers to stay away from public schools, which proves that the writings of dead white guys are still relevant today.  \n\nI was fortunate that my parents heeded this advice.  My sisters and I never set foot in a public school, except for three unbearably long days in Pompano Beach in 1970.  Once you\u2019ve gotten a taste for the private sector version of a thing, the government version will never be tolerable -- even if you are only nine years old.  No matter how often we moved up and down the east coast during our upbringing, my parents always found decent private schools in which to enroll us. \n\nWhat those schools all had in common was some sort of Christian affiliation -- whether it was Quaker, Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Methodist, and even one Baptist school briefly.  There was never an expectation that one become a Christian, but there was always an assumption that students would attend the required religious services and respect the foundational Judeo-Christian values.  That doesn\u2019t seem like a lot to ask and plenty of Jewish students as well as the occasional Hindu and Muslim attended as well. \nMy most vivid memories of those days are of the annual Christmas Pageants.  In Christian private schools, those reenactments of the birth of Christ, as told by Luke, take the form of a dramatic oratorio.  They were lavish productions that included beautiful costumes, readings from the bible and the singing of hymns and carols.  We rehearsed for weeks and everyone participated. \nOn the night of the pageant, just before Christmas break, the auditorium was full of parents, grandparents, and other relatives dressed in their most respectable attire.  There were no cell phones to interrupt, no fights, and no protesters shouting down the performance.  There were no victims.  Regardless of their race or faith, no one declined to participate because the parents and students all saw the value that a private education with a Judeo-Christian foundation could provide.  \n\nEvery family valued knowledge, learning, and education.  Every family valued work and aspired to a middle class lifestyle, or maybe just a little better.  Every parent wanted their children to be better than themselves, and not just financially; they wanted their children to be better people.  At that time, and in that society, no one was interested in emulating crude, low-class behavior and such conduct would certainly have been shunned.  \n\nAs the lights dimmed, and a palpable hush fell over the audience, a spotlight shone on the actors as the narrator read from the bible.  Even the babies were quiet.  Narration was followed by interludes in which the choir sang ancient European tunes.  Singing those hymns, I could feel the connection to my ancient ancestors celebrating the birth of Christ by candlelight, without computers, electricity, plumbing or heat.  Those ancient people, Celts in my case, celebrated the joy of life and God, though even the wealthiest of them had nothing by our current standards. \nForty five years later, I can still recall the visceral reaction -- the lump in my throat and the tears welling up as the pageant proceeded -- with all of us sixth graders in precious costumes reenacting a 2,000 year old event. \n\nThe story, so beautifully translated in the King James Version still creates an upwelling of emotion in me and I am not a Christian.  My best teachers and professors, mostly Catholic and Jewish intellectuals always correctly identified me as a pagan (the small p kind).  Although my sisters both adopted Catholicism later in life, I never have.  Lack of faith doesn\u2019t diminish the simple beauty of Luke\u2019s Nativity story a bit. \n\nDo they still do Christmas pageants anymore? I don\u2019t know. My children are grown.  My baby girl is 25, a soldier, and a jumpmaster in the army.  All of my children attended Catholic schools because they were the only private schools available in the rural area in which I raised them.  I had to make sure they received an education that would teach them about western civilization and Judeo-Christian values.  It was worth every penny. \n\nI feel a little sad for people who will never experience their own connections to their ancestral heritage, western civilization, the world, and the universe because they received a purely secular education.  Public education purposely omits such a huge portion of western culture from the curriculum that I fear the recipients can never learn what they need to become truly civilized human beings.  While many may get this through church, synagogue or in some other extracurricular venue, a significant part of the population is missing out completely.  Without the knowledge that there is something greater, without the understanding that universal truths do exist, how can you ever see life as being anything other than nasty, brutish, and short? \n\nLacking the sacred point of view, authoritarian rule becomes a necessity and the means to any end are always justified. Maybe this makes the twentieth century democide of as many as 260,000,000 humans easier to understand.  I suspect that secular education is also responsible for the SJW worldview that sees a mostly full glass as completely empty.  The angst, anger, vitriol, and downright hate voiced by so many in our society can only be explained as a lack of education and perspective. \n\nThe current, rampant rejection and denial of Judeo-Christian culture, especially in universities is also a mystery to me.  Across the planet, and especially in the west, we enjoy the highest standard of living ever known.  I don\u2019t understand how an educated person can refute the connection between millennia of intellectual achievement and our current prosperity.  \n\nFrom the Old Testament to the New, from Aristotle to Aquinas, and Locke, from Josquin and Palestrina to Bach, from Breughel to Leonardo, Michelangelo, and beyond, this collective knowledge is what has led us to our current understanding of humanity.  The shared achievements of western civilization, and particularly of Christianity, have led us to embrace human rights and improve the living conditions of billions of humans.  Ultimately, it is what got us to the moon and gave us the IPhone.  Is this even debatable? \n\nFor better or for worse, Judeo-Christian culture is how we got here \u2013 and it seems better to me. The values, ethics, and morals that have been passed on for the last few thousand years have built the incredible standard of living we have today across the globe.  Only a few decades ago, this was universally acknowledged, but we seem to have entered a new, dark age where knowledge, culture, and history have been eschewed. \n\nThe darkness of totalitarian rule always seems as if it could be upon us at the next turn and the disturbing penchant of millennials for socialism and communism frightens me.  To me, the only explanation for this seemingly invincible ignorance is that it is the inevitable result of a poor education, especially in morals, ethics and values.  \n\nI don\u2019t have a solution, but a reboot of our education system that includes a return to teaching Judeo-Christian ideas might be a good start. \n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Whatever happened to the Christmas pageant?"}

Which, I think, has become a worldwide need.\n\nIt is an open and free community to find people anytime, anywhere to exchange your cryptocurrencies for money (or the other way) on the spot. (Like localbitcoins, but without fees and available in 6 cryptocurrencies)\n\nMy case is that I\u2019m going to New York and I don't want to withdraw my cryptocurrencies in exchange for dollars (this would take days in my home country and lots of fees to pay), then carry fiat with me to travel the USA. If I needed some more money, I'm sure would have a hard time. Credit card? In my home country, if I spend money overseas with a credit card or any other card, I should pay 6% on taxes - yes, that sucks!\n\nSo I thought \u201cwould be GREAT if I could meet someone there and had it exchanged on spot, like a cashier, there must be lots of people who do that!\u201c, and then I thought:\n\nWhat about trust?\nWhat happens if the trader disappears with my money?\nWhat if I don\u2019t find anyone there?\nOr, the trader runs out of money and can\u2019t help me anymore?  \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t want to pay up to 15% fee to withdraw money on a Bitcoin ATM, that could be out of money or out of service. I'd prefer a human to do that.\n\nSo, I\u2019d like to introduce you to MONKS.EXCHANGE - it\u2019s a community intended to meet travelers and exchangers, also called Monks on the platform.\n\nBut again, what about trust!? Well, Uber solve it with rating stars (simple uh!?). So, that\u2019s how we did it. It\u2019s not likely that someone who did a thousand trades will steal a $100 from you. Yeah, a $100, I think the average transaction will be low since you\u2019ll be able to rely on Monks and make lots of withdrawals on your ongoing traveling anywhere in the world.\n\nWe firmly believe that it could become a way to make a living for Monks. Let\u2019s do some math here. If you become a Monk and trade an equivalent of $20k a day, at 1% fee, you would make roughly $6k a month - I guess you\u2019re imagining how much money those exchange websites are making with cryptocurrencies. Yeah, don\u2019t think about it - Or, it could be an alternative investment, every trade could make 1% profit or 2%, it's  up to you, you\u2019re the Monk!\n\nWhat about Monk protection? We strongly recommend that ALL transactions should happen in public places, like malls, markets, Starbucks, airports, etc. Not on your doorbell - be safe.\n\nSo, I\u2019m inviting you to our website MONKS.EXCHANGE. We\u2019re accepting Monks around the world TODAY! If you\u2019re interested in becoming a Monk, we have a simple, fast and easy form.\n\nOur goal is to create an open ecosystem of decentralized cryptocurrency exchange services and help people to get their money traded without any intermediary or delays.   \n  \nThanks for your time.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Much-needed project just LAUNCHED!!!

He goes so far as to recommend cultivating the ability to launch a nuclear attack on foreign cities.

The USSR GDP grew about 11.8% from the period 1928-40 and in addition, it grew about 9-10% annually from 1948-60. From the period 1928-60, the Soviet GDP grew about 7.7% annually despite the enormous destruction in the 2nd World War. In the 1960s, the USSR grew about 6.5% annually and from 1970-89, the Soviet economy grew about 4.3% annually. In comparison, the American GDP all throughout this period only grew about 2-3% annually and in fact, only China(if we exclude microstates and city states) from 1978-present has had faster economic growth rates than the USSR from 1928-89. In addition, East Germany as well had higher economic growth rates than West Germany. From 1949-1961, the East German economy grew at about 11-12% annually and from 1961-1989, the East German economy grew about 4.5% annually. In contrast, the West German economy grew only about 8.2% annually in the 1950s and only grew 2.7% annually between 1961-1989.

The reasons for why there were bread lines in WW2 should be self explanatory(the USA also had breadlines in wartime). In the 1980s, the bread lines were caused by Gorbachev's market reforms which had reduced resource allocation efficiency. It should also be noted that the Soviet people had a calorie intake per capita even matched that of the USA(until 1985 which was when Gorbachev implemented market reforms). It should also be mentioned that waiting in line didn't take hours. According to \"Statisches Jahrbuch 1997 der Bundesrepublik Deutschland\", West Germans spent an average 15 minutes shopping. This was about the same time it took waiting in line in the USSR according to \"Russia: a History\" by Gregory Freeze.

Williamson, and the YT videos of Julie Borowski (please don't laugh at my ignorance(!)).\n\nI am very interested in the ideas and perspectives these people are putting forward and which I take to be generally of a libertarian bent (I assume I'm right there, otherwise this will be embarrassing). \n\nBut two questions keep coming up which don't (to me at least) seem resolvable within my understanding of a libertarian framework:\n\n1) Sovereignty\n\nSmith wrote *The Wealth of Nations* - Nations being the operative word in this question: **Q1a** Aren't free markets inherently internationalist and global in outlook? **Q1b** If the role of the state is most often what causes the problems the state is there to resolve, what does a 'nation' look like under libertarianism? \n\nBorders limit the sphere of influence of a particular country's laws and regulations, but at the same time they throw up a barrier to international trade and - controversially - to migration.\n\n**Q1c** Under libertarianism, is the role of the state limited to Law and the organs that carry out the Law - e.g. the courts, the police, the border agencies, the coast guard etc.? But what if the state then understands that - for example - oil or coal are absolutely essential to the wealth and health of the nation and, therefore, this means that countries which export oil and coal are of strategic interest. **Q1d** Does that then not make it inevitable that the state that belongs to a sovereign nation will always need to expand its sphere of control in order to ensure its own security and longevity? **Q1e** And when that happens, does that not encourage the nation state to join forces with private enterprise involved in key industries such as the energy sector making the rise of the superpowerful multinational corporation an inevitable feature of a libertarianism which is also national in character?\n\n**Q1f** Finally, and again controversially, what is the status of a national culture under libertarianism if there is no state machinery to help foster that culture through, e.g. public education? \n\n2) Stability\n\nAnother question I have over free markets is the impact it has on individual lives.\n\nFor instance, taxi driving has been a reliable fall back job for anyone with a serviceable car for a couple of decades now - true, it doesn't make a lot of money and the hours are unsociable (not to mention the unsociability of some of the fares they get), but at least it's there as a fallback. But even that seems likely to go as a profession in the next 10-20 years or so.\n\nThe counterargument to such things is often that while it's true that some jobs disappear, others are created in their place. Now I agree with this and see that it makes sense - but that does not make for a stable existence.\n\nSo **Q2a** how is a man or woman with family commitments such as a mortgage, elderly relatives, young children, supposed to cope with the disruption that such changes bring about? **Q2b** Isn't it very easy to see how attractive certain of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump's policies are when what they are promising is a chance to be able to see your children grow up in the same area and you grow old in the same house? **Q2c** What can a libertarian outlook offer to such people apart from an uncertain and chaotic existence that might well be 'good for the economy', but which might also very well suck for them personally?\n\nAnd it's not just individuals and their families that this applies to - companies of whatever size can only realistically plan for expansion and future development if they have a more or less guaranteed income stream that will help them to manage any debts they accrue in acquiring the capital they need to grow their business.\n\nThis in turn makes long-term government contracts highly attractive - because tax money is always there and so government investment holds the promise of the kind of long-term stability that makes expansion and growth a real possibility. \n\nSo **Q2d** Does this make reliance on the state inevitable even within a free market? And **Q2e** doesn't that in turn make collaboration (and also therefore the possibility for collusion and corruption) inevitable in a libertarian free market society?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"New here - would like to ask questions about the place of the nation state and national culture and about stability"}
