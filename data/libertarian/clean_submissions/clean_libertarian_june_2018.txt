{"author":"DILGE","created_utc":1527822240,"num_comments":16,"score":0,"selftext":"I really appreciate this sub, even though I don't agree with the hive mind a lot of the time.  You guys seem to be quite civil. Let's have a discussion.  Here goes:  \n\nI have been a Democratic voter for many years, but have recently started to become disillusioned with the current state of the Democratic party.  I think Hillary was a terrible candidate, and had she not owned the DNC and sabotaged him, Bernie could have mopped the floor with Trump.  The Republican party is even worse, it's all ideology, no substance.  There are no Republican party members I know of that actually give a shit about their constituents.   I feel there is no real party that actually reflects the values of the average American voter.  \n\nAs a \"liberal\" however, I diverge from other liberals in that I 100&amp;#37; support the 2nd Amendment.  The ability to protect oneself is the highest form of personal freedom and as such, \"shall not be infringed\".  The fact that I've been robbed at gunpoint probably factors into my opinion.\n\nHowever, I don't agree with the many libertarians that advocate pure capitalism with zero regulations.  This only rewards the bullies in the market and punishes the small actors.\n\nHave any of you guys ever read The Jungle by Upton Sinclair?  I'm reading it right now, and it really brings home the main problems of capitalism, mainly greed.  The book has a reputation for being about the gross stuff the meatpackers got away with, but the main point of the book is labor issues, such as outlining the way businesses were able to use human beings as cogs in their giant machines to be easily replaced when profit margins deemed it prudent.\n\n  \n This is what they had in turn of the century Chicago.  There were no laws to prevent large\\-scale swindles, which became the natural order of things.  Corporations could throw home\\-\"owners\" out of homes they had been swindled into assuming they owned.  Nutrition\\-free potato starch was used extensively in sausages to stretch whatever meat sweepings were put in them.  There was no such thing as the 40\\-hour work week, or even the concept of full\\-time employment for that matter.  If there was not a lot of work to be had, laborers would have no choice but to stand around from dawn until dusk, maybe working an hour or two when something needed to be done, and they would only be paid for that hour or two.  There was no such thing as worker's compensation, so if one got injured on the job and couldn't work they would be fired.  If there was actually a law or two in place to help in such a situation, there was none to require an employer inform their employee of such a law.\n\nThese are the things that happen with unregulated capitalism.  Greed takes over.  Corners are cut.   The standard workplace regulations that we now take for granted came about as a result of the massive backlash to these horrible conditions.  \n\nSo anybody that says we should have less regulation I fear is not understanding the true value of such regulations.   That's not to say rules and regulations cannot be misused in order to enrich the elite.  What I am saying is, a lot of regulations are there for a reason and we shouldn't just abolish them willy nilly.\n\nWhat do you guys think about all of this?  Thanks.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"50% Libertarian? CMV."}

I thought we were doing a good thing for ourselves but now I think we are trapped.\n\nFull backstory: A friend recommended their \"financial advisor\" to us. We thought \"Great! We've been meaning to meet with someone... we have a kid on the way and husband isn't putting away anything towards retirement since starting his new job in August\". \n\nSo we set up phone meeting with his friend from Northwestern Mutual. She gives us a call, and we end up speaking with her for over an hour. She asks us lots of questions- what we are looking for (we tell her we want to set up retirement stuff for husband and explore maybe putting some of our 17k in savings into CD's or mutual funds). She asks us questions about when we see ourselves retiring, how \"aggressive\" we are, etc. All good stuff. We hang up and agree to talk again in a week when she will give us a plan.\n\nCut to a week later, we are having a phone meeting with her and she emails me THE PLAN. It's many many pages basically explaining what we have vs. what we will need if we want to retire.  But she mostly just talks about how we need more life insurance. \"Sure\" we think. Maybe we do need more life insurance. She explains that husband needs at least $1mill in life insurance and I need $500k (we both already have $150k policies through work on ourselves). This is news to us but we hear her out. She also spends a ton of time explaining how we need to have disability insurance. Again, we think \"maybe we do\". So we spend the greater part of an hour and a half talking about life insurance and long term disability insurance. She briefly mentions we should be maxing out my Roth IRA and we could perhaps start one for husband. So we hang up, with plans to talk again in a week and sign some paperwork.\n\nOver the next week, husband and I really realize that we don't want disability insurance (she quoted us paying like $170\/month) and we didn't really feel we needed more life insurance at this time (she had us paying $340\/month in permanent and $125\/month in term). But we were ok maxing out my Roth at $450\/month. We also wanted to explore stocks\/bonds\/CD's\/mutual funds more (like we initially told her). So I sent this all to her in an email before our next meeting. She sends back \"OK, great! Sounds good.. talk soon\".\n\nCut to another phone meeting, where she would talk with us about our updated PLAN. She emails us the NEW PLAN while we are on the phone. LITERALLY NOTHING IS CHANGED. She proceeds to spend the next hour convincing us why we need life insurance and disability insurance. Husband and I are both pushovers and listen to the whole schpeel again. Every time we bring up a reason why we don't feel like we need it, she tells us how we are wrong. I mean, she's the professional, we thought. I still expressed my disinterest in disability insurance but wasn't completely closing the door on life insurance. She kept giving me the guilt trip on \"what will your kids have if one of you dies!\". By the end of the conversation, I hadn't agreed to anything except to roll over my Roth to Northwestern. She had me give her my bank routing info to get \"the paperwork started\". She also said she was going to be sending me a bunch of stuff to sign in the next few weeks, but it was just to apply for things... nothing was set in stone. We could just see what the insurance company was going to quote us at, and we still aren't committed to anything. \"Ugh fine\" I think. She says a small amount might be taken out of my checking, but its just to make sure \"the charges are able to go through when we start moving more money to my Roth\".\n\nSO a week or two goes by. And I see a ~$30 charge go through for \"disability insurance\". WHICH I TOLD HER I DIDN'T WANT!! And I just realize... this doesn't feel good. It doesn't seem right. She's not listening to what we want. She still hasn't addressed out interest in CD\/mutual funds\/stocks that we initially came to her for. I spend the weekend doing my due diligence- spending a few hours on r\/personalfinance, NerdWallet, just googling in general about what husband and I should really be doing. I decide to call the whole thing off with Northwestern.\n\nIt's been a nightmare trying to cut off ties with her. I was kind and courteous through the first couple emails and subsequent texts \"We really appreciate your time but have decided to pull out. Again, thank you\". \n\nShe is being evasive and manipulative. Telling us we are completely wrong and we still need to work with her. At this point I have just ignored any further communication. It has just been a really bad experience. \n\n\nBut THE REAL REASON I still feel like I can't completely ignore her, is that I asked her several times when I should expect to see a refund for the disability insurance THAT I DID NOT WANT AND DID NOT AGREE TO. She just dances around the question. I'm also worried because I have gotten a \"bill\" (no charges yet) in the mail for the $340\/month in permanent and $125\/month in term and $170 in short term disability. \n\nIs there anything I can do to make sure I don't get charged this? If I communicate with her any farther, she just tries to talk to us about why we need to invest with her, etc. \n\nWHAT DO WE DO. She is being shady AF.

A lot of people will try to justify it by saying \u201coh, some are good but the illegals are bad, legal Hispanics are fine\u201d. The problem with this rationale is that Trump has been critical of Hispanics that were born here as well, with him complaining about having a Hispanic  judge for the Trump university case. Looking at this along with other remarks Trump has made, it is obvious that he doesn\u2019t like Hispanics. I agree with him because their loyalty is not to the United States, but it is to Mexico or the drug cartels.\n\n\n Their largest organization has the term la raza in it, which literally means Mexican nationalism. I respect that they are family oriented and hardworking people, which would explain why they are so nationalistic, even the ones born in America. However, nationalism that is expressed by la raza has no place in America, just like the American Nazi party, KKK, Black Panthers, etc don\u2019t have any place in America. It may not be politically correct, but it\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s unfortunate that having these types of discussions are considered taboo due to the PC culture, as uncomfortable as they can be, we need to have them. In the 1800\u2019s the white slave owners didn\u2019t want to accept the at the time radical idea that slaves were people that were being exploited for their labor, as they were regularly dehumanized then. In the 1960\u2019s both the George Wallace type southern white separatists and black nationalists didn\u2019t want to discuss integration. Nowadays, there is racial tension with blacks and police, and with Hispanics and America as a whole. Political correctness is used to shut down these discussions, and thus needs to stop.

Similar to the ones like PIPA,CISPA,SOPA and all othe bullshit that was pushed in the US a while ago, but much more Orwellian.\n\nIt basically has 2 parts:\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n## LINK TAX\n\nThe EU is proposing a link tax, whereby content producers will be forced to pay a tax for every link on their website to other people's websites. This obviously includes links that users post as well.\n\nSo content providers will be forced to pay a tax for every link to copyrighted content and part of the tax from what I understand will go to the author.\n\nNow we know from basic economics that all \"producer taxes\" are essentially \"consumer taxes\" whereby their will all be deferred to the user. The content providers will just charge their users  a fee to cover this tax.\n\n# THIS WILL BE THE LITERAL THE END OF FREE SPEECH IN THE EU ESSENTIALLY, AS FROM THEN ON YOU'D HAVE TO PAY A FEE TO POST ANYTHING ON THE INTERNET: NO MORE MEMES, NO MORE 3RD PARTY PHOTOS, NOTHING WILL BE ALLOWED TO BE POSTED FOR FREE ANYMORE.\n\nSimilar to the social media tax passed in Uganda, but the EU tax would apply to all websites and all copyrighted material:\n\n* https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/06\/01\/africa\/uganda-social-media-tax\/index.html\n\n\nHow will they enforce this? The next part.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n## UPLOAD FILTERS\n\n\nThe EU is also proposing the creation, for any content hoster, of an upload filter, whereby their will detect any copyrighted content, and not allow it to pass through.\n\nEssentially content providers will be forced to censor their users content. Obviously this removes \"fair use\" as well, as a dumb robot will not be able to distinguish between fair use and sarcasm compared to financial use.\n\nSo basically they will force all content providers, including social media, but every other website owner essentially to adopt this.\n\nAll internet platforms from then on will be forced to monitor every user content and filter,block or censor copyrighted content.\n\nYou don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that this will be eventually extended to block essentially anything. And for a content producer to avoid fines, they would just shut down all speech.Total censorship.\n\n# THE END OF FREE SPEECH IN EUROPE, USHERING IN ANOTHER NAZI TOTALITARIAN RULE IN EUROPE!\n\nThey want to turn the Internet back into a TV-like system where you can't post anything only consume things.

However, I have several problems with open boarders.\n\n1: It would create a race to the bottom.  Its no secret that thousands of generally unskilled workers would lose their jobs if the boarders were opened, due to the giant influx of unskilled labor.  You could argue that the people who lose their jobs deserve it.  If they can't compete, why should their jobs be protected by the government?  That's a valid argument, but what about their children and families?  Do they deserve to suffer as well?  The only way the effects would be mitigated is if we implemented some sort of basic income, or, at the very least, a negative income tax.  I don't see our government doing that anytime soon.\n\n2: It would make it significantly more difficult to ensure that immigrants are assimilating into our culture, and that they do not pose a threat.  Why should we allow a giant influx of people from countries such as Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan who believe in strict Sharia Law, and do not support the rights of women, homosexuals, or other minorities?  Why should we allow a giant influx of people who refuse to speak English, which would cost the taxpayer money to expand bilingual education, documents, etc, and would cause more animosity between citizens and immigrants?\n\n3: It would cause brain drain.  The thinking behind open borders is that the brilliant people residing in Africa or Haiti do not have the resources to utilize their skills, so by allowing them to immigrate to America, they will make our society more prosperous.  Okay, what about the countries that they left behind?  They would loose all their brilliant citizens.

Since it cannot be disputed that this is so (one cannot communicate and argue that one cannot communicate and argue), and since it must be assumed that everyone knows what it means to claim something to be true (one cannot deny this statement without claiming its negation to be true), this very fact has been aptly called \"the a priori of communication and argumentation.\" (EEPP, p. 314)\"\n\nhttps:\/\/mises.org\/library\/argumentation-ethics-and-liberty-concise-guide\n\n\"J\u00fcrgen Habermas, (born June 18, 1929, D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany), the most important German philosopher of the second half of the 20th century.

The stench of fire and electricity as one.\n\nOn the battlefield everyone is dead and alive, like some gruesome adaptation of schrodinger's cat.\n\nBut the atoms decay and reveal who is still alive and who is dead.\n\nHollywood makes it seem like being in the armed forces creates the ultimate sense of fraternity and while it may be true in part, just list everything else in showbiz, its greatly exaggerated.\n\nThere was of course camaraderie but some of my fellow troops did manage to get on my nerves from time to time.\n\nBut let me tell you something: You will never feel more compassion for the human condition when you\u2019re witnessing everyone around you get maimed.\n\nA fellow soldier had just stepped on a land mine, dead instantly. The man next to him though had been knocked down blood smeared all over his face. I didn't know if he was still alive but instinctively dragged him into the nearest building. \n\nBullets whizzed past, puncturing the stones walls. The compound seem like it had once been a living space, but now there was nobody there, it was deserted.\n\nThis is what war does.\n\nThen it happened, so quickly, an explosion rocked the compound. If the land mine hadn't killed him, this explosion certainly did. \n\nBecause it killed me. I swear to God, it killed me.\n\nIts like when they use to execute people via guillotine and then hold the head up for one last view. The explosion had flung me out of the compound, in fact the compound had been reduced to rubble. \n\nI was knocked on my back or what was left of it, as I was barely able to lift my head to look at myself and see my insides strewn all over the ground and rubble, forget about legs.\n\nI closed my eyes and took a deep breath, I imagined this was how all those French aristocrats felt during the reign of terror. I exhaled and opened m eyes and then I saw him.\n\nDressed in all black, was standing a man in the sky, directly over me, it was almost comical, in all this bloodshed for him to be there, floating horizontally, like a demented Mary Poppins.\n\nHe then began walking towards me, as if on solid ground, I then realized I was standing upright on ground and the lower 3\/4 of my body was intact once again.\n\nThe man now stood directly in front of me, giving me a better view. He was dressed in all black, and in his hand seemed to be a matching black stetson. He appeared elderly, his skin was olive colored, wrinkled, similar worn out leather. He had a pointy  nose and protruding cheek bones to match, and atop his head was gray hair.\n\nWe were still in Fallujah, but everything was still, but flickered at the same time, the way an old  paused VCR cassette would.\n\n\"Am I dead?\" I somehow managed to ask.\n\n\"There is no death, only a becoming.\"\n\nHe answered, his voice stern and expression stoic. Then he continued.\n\n\"But in your understanding; it is not your time.\"\n\n\"What is happening?\" \n\nHe didn't respond and instead placed the Stetson over his head, the brim casting a dark shadow over his eyes. He then turned around and began walking.\n\n\"Follow me into the desert.\"\n\nI looked up towards the sun shining brightly near the middle of the sky, it seemed to be the only thing not completely frozen.  In fact I felt it\u2019s warmth as I never had before. \nThe man kept walking, in the opposite direction of the sun, I followed as there was nothing else to be done. In fact, I felt thankful only moments ago I had been torn to shreds and now was whole again.\n\nWe walked for what seemed to be forever, until Fallujah seemed a distant memory and we were deep in the desert.\n\nAs we continued, everything remained still, except the sun.\n\nThe further we went the further the sun moved towards the horizon, as if we moving the very Earth itself with every step we took. In fact it seemed as though gravity was getting denser, steps becoming more and more laborious, although the man seemed to have no issue.\n\nThen something caught my eye, the ground was writhing as if something was trying to come out. I attempted to look behind me.\n\n\"Look away!\" The man promptly said while still walking forward, never turning back.\n\nMy gaze returned towards him.\n\n\"Never look behind us again.\"\n\n\"Okay, but where are we going?\"\n\n\"Nowhere.\" He said simply.\n\n\"But then where have we been walking to all this time?\" I said exasperated.\n\n\"I already told you about time and we are going nowhere, it has been coming to us.\"\n\nI shook my head frustrated and continued trudging onward growing more and more tired then I finally realized that the landmarks of the desert had remained the same, as if we truly had gone nowhere.\n\n\"What is coming to us then\"\n\nHe pointed toward the horizon.\n\n\"That.\"\n\nI focused on the horizon and saw a little black mound appearing, instinctively I almost looked back to try and glimpse at the sun.\n\n\"Don't look back! The sun is sinking, the day is dying.\"\n\nAs we kept walking, the dark mound grew larger and larger, gravity becoming denser and denser, my movements more arduous. The sky began to change to the hue of the twilight hours.  I couldn\u2019t see it but I felt the weight of the sun set on my shoulders.\n\nThe mound continued to grow until it hit its  maximum girth and then continued to rise out of the horizon, it bottom half decreasing in size, revealing itself as the shape of a perfect circle. The same size as the sun.\n\nA dark sun. \n\nAlthough where the sun had been bright, warm, and giving off light, this anomaly was cold and seemed to be pulling all the light towards it.\n\nThe gravity was immense at this point and I collapsed on all fours.\n\nAlthough once the dark sun was completely over the horizon, the sky had become night and the man finally stopped walking. \n\nHe turned around and from the ground I looked up to see his face once again, in the the faint light it seemed even more ghostly then before, as the bones his cheek appeared to protrude even further.\n\n\"Stand up and turn around.\"\n\nHe commanded, remorseless.\n\nStruggling I rose to my feet and then turned around to see that we were now standing on the edge of a tall cliff with a view of the desert below. The sand of the desert seemed to be alive as it squirmed and shifted, like a sea of worms. There was a slight hum, then it began to grow as the ground continued to shake.\n\nThen it began.\n\nBodies. An unimaginable, incomprehensible amount of bodies began to arise from the sand into the dark sky forming a stream that lead directly into the dark sun. The hum now grew to a collective whale and gnashing of the swarm of people being engulfed.\n\nI turned back to the man in horror.\n\n\"Do not look away!\" He commanded.\n\n\"I can't!\" \n\n\"You must!\"\n\nI stared back into the desert of flesh, to see men, women, children that seemed to come from all eras of humanity being absorbed into the dark sun. They wailed and screamed. They spoke languages long dead and others that had not yet formed. Some of them bore injuries, men missing limbs, women defiled, elderly gouged, children who had been slaughtered.\n\n\"Why have you brought me here!\" I screamed.\n\nHe remained silent only looking into the desert.\n\nThe dark sun traversed the sky, tracing the movements of the regular sun.\n\nAll the while engorging itself on the stream of bodies.\n\nGravity felt immense. All I could do was scream, until it felt as if my lungs had given in and my throat had collapsed. I felt the pressure inside my body, on each individual organ inside, as if I was back in Fallujah torn apart.\n\n\"What is this?\" I pleaded\n\n\"The becoming.\" He answered.\n\nThe dark sun was now beginning its own descent into the opposing horizon.\n\n\"Why have you brought me here?\" I repeated.\n\nAgain he was silent.\n\n\"Why? I was dead! torn to pieces why did you bring me to this place, to this horror?\" I declared in a rage.\n\nHe remained silent.\n\nThe dark sun continued to sink, as the sky began to change into dawn.\n\nFinally the dark sun completely sank in to the horizon and the desert was still once again. The whaling and gnashing had subsided to a low hum and then ceased all together. I looked at the other side to see the crown of the sun rising flooding the sky with a sea of orange, yellow, and a touch of pink.\n\nThe tide of gravity finally ceded and had returned to normal and I fell to my knees before the man.\n\n\"Why?Why?Why?\" I muttered.\n\nHe leaned down and then pointed a finger towards the rising sun.\n\n\"I already told you. Time is no longer *yours*.\"\n\nI then completely collapsed, into a deep slumber.\n\nI awoken in a cold sweat, breathing heavily.\n\n\"Nightmare, again?\" My wife asks worried.\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nI sit up on the bed letting my feet dangle over the edge. The early dawn light comes faintly through the window. I stand up and move to it and then shift the blinds with my fingers to see the rays of the sun coming from the horizon. I let the blinds go, exhaling, relieved as if I had been expecting something other then our sun.\n\n\"Honey, is everything okay?\" she questions troubled.\n\n\"It's just a nightmare.\" I respond.\n\n\"Fallujah?\" \n\nI return to the bed curling up next to her and hug her tightly.\n\n\"Yes, Fallujah.\"\n\nThats what I told everyone. That a mortar had exploded and flung me away and in my dazed i had though most of my body had been blown off.\n\nBut I didn't tell anyone about the man from the desert.\n\nOr about the dark sun.\n\nOr about the becoming.\n\nBut deep down, in those same intestines I though had been blown to bits, I knew.\n\nThat it was more then a nightmare.\n\nThat it was still out there.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"the becoming"}

{"author":"-Littlezero-","created_utc":1528003820,"num_comments":11,"score":8,"selftext":"Full disclosure, I am a member of the LDS faith also known as the Mormon church. I also live in the United States. If I had to describe my political views, I guess I would call myself a constitutional libertarian. I had an interesting discussion with a friend who is also LDS about laws around marriage. I am a strong supporter of freedom and  although my religious views might not support homosexuality, I would never try to force my religious views on others and I don't think the government should as well. \n\nIn my conversation with my friend he asked me if I supported gay marriage. I explained to him that I didn't see my views as supporting anything other than I don't think the government should be able to tell people who they can and cannot marry. In my religious view, I personally believe that marriage was defined by God and he defined it as a union between a man and a woman. So in a way, even if a homosexual couple wanted to say they are married, in my mind it isn't really marriage. And I doubt a homosexual couple would care about my opinion anyway. I am sure they just want to be happy just as much as I do. I also said that even if there is a law or not, people with homosexual feelings are still going to have those feelings and fall in love with each other. As long as they are not stopping me from enjoying my rights and my life, I see no point in trying to make their lives miserable by using the government as a weapon against them. \n\nMy friend on the other hand is very much against the legalization of gay marriage. In his defense, his views come from strong feelings about what he believes and what he thinks is right and wrong. Our church also has a history of supporting laws that would prevent gay marriage. He was very surprised by my views and for some reason, he seemed to not understand that I was not in support of gay marriage, but rather, I was in support of the government just getting out of the marriage business altogether and let people define their unions themselves. He thought that was crazy and honestly believed that if gay marriage was legal it would harm society. My friend is well educated, but I kind of felt like his opinion was not very well thought out and probably offensive to some people. \n\nHe seemed kind of offended towards my views until I brought up the example of the government going after the LDS church over polygamy. For those who do not know, my faith early on practiced polygamy and allowed some families to have multiple women married to one husband. Polygamy was made illegal eventually, and the government threatened to arrest the church's leaders and take away our church buildings if we continued to allow it. Despite how you may feel about polygamy, because I know that can be just as controversial to some people as gay marriage can be, I still feel like it was wrong for the government to come after the church like that. Because of that law, our faith no longer practices it and it caused some uncomfortable situations for the families that were already living that way. Some people even left our church to form their own religions so they could try to continue this practice. \n\nI only share this because it was one of those moments when I could see in his eyes that moment of realization of what I was talking about. The same type of government oppression had a major effect on those people's lives and still has made a change in the way people in our religion are able to marry. And he finally started to understand what I meant. People who are not LDS might find polygamy highly offensive. Just like he finds homosexuality offensive. And even though the government came after our church, he was willing to allow it to happen to others. \n\nI just thought I would share this to see if any other people have found times when their religious views, or just life values in general have ever made you stop and think about your libertarian views. In this case at least, I think freedom is the best solution. It would stop a lot of needless fighting between people who otherwise could get along just fine. There is no reason to have hard feelings between homosexual people and people who have for example, a Christian faith. I think it does more harm than good. \n\nThere might be other issues, like divorce and other things that get handled in courts over marriage, but I honestly think that stuff could be figured out. Thanks for reading. ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Interesting discussion on gay marriage"}

The small block crew doesn't debate technology because that's never what any of this was actually about, and  something mentally slipped into place for me recently when I fully grasped the nature and implications of the divorce of the settlement and transaction layers in a broader macroeconomic and historical sense. \n\nThe fundamental promise of cryptocurrencies is a final solution to the previously impossible problem of an optimal currency. This is somewhat condensed, so allow me to unpack it.\n\nThe economy is a consensual shared mass hallucination. Everyone does what they do in order to get by within it because they see it as the best combination of what is in their abilities, coupled with what the rest of humanity that they trade with values. In order to get an accurate measure of what one should be doing at any one point in time, it necessarily follows that one needs a stable, immutable and constant unit of account to figure out the proper true value of provision of a product or service at any point in time.\n\nPolitical currencies, which are commonly referred to now as \"fiat currencies\" and very poorly understood by the great mass of humanity which employ them, are anathema to this goal of figuring out the proper values of things, exactly because they are designed to be subject to infinite manipulation by the issuing authorities, which are politically appointed and accountable. Therefore any given government is incentivised to tamper extensively with the currency in order to provide \"chicken in every pot\" style benefits to their voting populace and remain in power and pay off their sponsors who so situated them.\n\nThis process necessarily distorts the market and results in things like having more bankers per capita than police, ad et al, despite bankers being fundamentally useless things. Stories must be spun about economic crises and situations which justify monetary policies which result in the desired economic distortions that keep the votes flowing in. Eventually the system fails as even the slowest of the slow realise that it's all just a shell game where everyone is pretending that everything has value when none of it actually does in the slightest.\n\nSimply put; it's my belief that this is what's happening now. You're not seeing \"a crypto bubble\", you're seeing \"the popping of the fiat bubble\".\n\nFirst point about that; old school austrian gold standard types would about this point be nodding their heads and preparing to launch into a tirade about the necessity of resuming the gold standard so that we may have a hard mechanism to value once again. This misses the critical point that gold is necessarily by physical nature as a currency largely separated into transaction and settlement portions. This was less a weakness in a smaller economy where trade could be conducted with coins and things of this manner, but when global trades are measured in tons of the underlying extremely precious metal, it's simply unrealistic to imagine that it's going to be sloshing around the globe constantly in battleships loaded with bars.\n\nAnd that leads to the core problem with a gold standard that will re-emerge later in this tirade, so keep it in mind. The divorce of the transaction layer from the settlement layer enables corrupt influence and tampering within the system in much the exact same way as the fiat system. Historically \"fractional reserve\" banking with a set portion of gold was a mild form of this, and reserves dwindled over time as it became politically expedient to \"expand the economy and not be tied down by something as parochial as gold\", and other associated ridiculous excuses to circumvent the entire purpose of the apparatus.\n\nThis has grown to epidemic portions in the present market where paper gold trade outweighs physical gold trade by a ratio of 542 to 1. Given that, obviously the paper gold trade is going to set the price of the physical gold, and the value is once again utterly divorced from any kind of stable actual reality by which prices can be said to accurately reflect value.\n\nSecond point about that, and why Bitcoin is such a failure, as well as the agenda you can very easily see within this zombie shambling about in the carcass of what was once a beautiful idea; The core treachery that has been inflicted upon the project is what? You guessed it; to divorce the settlement and transaction layers from one another, which makes it once again subject to the exact same weaknesses as gold in the modern world with its laughable 542 to 1 paper to physical transaction to settlement layer.\n\nIf I were a paranoid man. A conspiracy theorist, say. I would speculate that the hijacking of the Bitcoin project specifically that as resulted in this divorce of transaction and settlement layers, when no such divorce is required from a technical perspective whatsoever, is everything one should need to know about the forces behind the project, who really has control, and which direction it is being pushed.\n\nBut I'm not and that's all crazy talk, right? I'm sure our new Bitcoin overlords are all sweetness and light and not out to just re-implement the same currently imploding system with a fashionable new rebel label stuck upon it by any means at all, because that would just be evil.\n\nAnyway, on to *REAL* cryptocurrencies, and what distinguishes them from the hijacked version of Bitcoin, and what therefore makes them such a threat to that system, as well as the old currently imploding mainstream economic system, is precisely the fact that the transactional and settlement layers are *not* divorced. They are exactly the same thing. You cannot tamper with any part of the system, it is a steel cable from one participant in the economy to another, with each participant being able to cryptographically verify the characteristics of the transactions which they undertake, and observe that the supply is not being tampered with in real time on a globally distributed constantly available ledger, which in turn is not subject to interference from any of the traditional forces of monetary parasitism encompassed by central banks and nation states.\n\nIt terrifies them exactly because it should, it is to nation states and central banking what uber is to cabs, what airbnb is to hotels, what any distributed impossible to control economy that only cares about actually accomplishing the goal for which it was created is to any sideshow which merely pretends to be the case, but is in fact some other thing like a passive income earning mechanism for taxi medallion holders, or owners of hotel chains, ad et al.\nPut simply, If real cryptocurrencies win, they will be out of a job permanently.\n\nSo in conclusion, no. No matter what the final value of Bitcoin is, I don't see it as valuable, or as any kind of actual competition for real cryptocurrencies. I see it as an opportunity to ride the wave and profit simply by the unjustified expansion of value as the old system undergoes collapse and tries to cram as much of its ill gotten gains into this fake shambling zombie as it possibly can, with the added bonus that they seem not to realise, or have accepted as unavoidable, that they can't stop real crypto holders from taking the gains out of the dozens of liquid channels from BTC into those real cryptocurrencies that presently exist and will only grow in value over time.\n\nThe end result in my view is that the implosion in the mainstream economy will merely echo up the chain and into the chamber of their Bitcoin golem, and all that will be left is actual cryptocurrencies, which will be \"proper money\" and anything less than that will be recognised for the fraud it is.","subreddit":"btc","title":"Divorcing the settlement and transaction layers; the long con and maybe the real story behind the hijacking of Bitcoin.""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"X-post: What you're not seeing \"a crypto bubble\", what you're seeing \"the popping of the fiat bubble\"."}

That\u2019s your property, that\u2019s your right. For some reason we are fine with people shitposting all over this sub every Sunday. They\u2019re taking an open dump all over our ideology, and we think that we\u2019re so cool because we let them walk all over us. We think we\u2019re so progressive and so open. No, it\u2019s not cool. It\u2019s not progressive and it\u2019s not open. It shows that we actually do not care about our ideology, because we don\u2019t protect it. \n\nNobody is going \u201cWow, I want to be a libertarian because they are so pro free-speech that they don\u2019t censor out racist garbage from their subreddit.\u201d To think that any potential investigator of libertarianism would ever have this takeaway is ridiculous.\n\nThose involved in this bombardment are smart. They\u2019ve figured out that we don\u2019t actually understand our own ideology in the context of the internet. Our values are at odds with government intervention in moderating this subreddit, but there is nothing in libertarianism that suggests that we cannot moderate that which is in our own personal stewardship. It\u2019s not any less libertarian to JUST filter out these shitposters. \n\nBut since this hasn\u2019t happened, and probably won\u2019t, I suggest joining some of the other libertarian subreddits that don\u2019t let people crap all over their yard every day at 10:30. r\/GoldAndBlack r\/LibertarianDiscourse and possibly others whose existence I haven\u2019t been made aware of.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"My thoughts on modding this sub."}

I think that the government has no right to tell people that they can or can't use drugs, since use of drugs doesn't violate anyone else's rights. However, scientific research has proven almost every drug to have health consequences later in life (lung cancer for smoking tobacco or pot, liver damage for excessive alcohol use, etc.). Because of this, I think that the use of recreational drugs (with the exception of alcohol in severe moderation) is stupid and self-destructive.

A reminder to the reader, this is a series I called TERRITORIAL DISPUTES. I introduced basic conceptual elements and thereafter, I apply a theoretical frame (based on Rawlsian methodology) to solve well-known sovereignty disputes or conflicts. I explore what reasonable people would do in a territorial dispute. This is a theoretical experiment that deals with IDEAL theory only. There is no claim to NON IDEAL theory hence issues like lack of compliance are not explored.\n\nIn order to do it, I assume the representatives of each claiming party (sovereign States and a non-sovereign character) choose a rule based on theory game. I go for the maximin. From there, these ideal people come up with a solution to the conflict.\n\nLast week I introduced a new case for our  TERRITORIAL DISPUTES series: Crimea. The first four posts have to do with background information related to the dispute itself in order to set the stage for hypothetical negotiations. The fifth post introduces my solution which I call EGALITARIAN SHARED SOVEREIGNTY. This week I'll complete five new posts. \n\nQuestions for the readers:\n1. Any disagreement with the facts?\n2. Any information or opinion you may want to share?\n3. How can we solve this territorial dispute?\n\nREMINDER Note: I\u2019ll only post on r\/Libertarian on Tuesday a summary of what I do weekly on the blog to avoid spamming this sub-reedit as that is not my intention. I only aim to open a healthy discussion.\n\nComments welcomed. Guest writers would be hugely appreciated. As you may see from the posts I don't take sides and I do this with utmost respect to all people involved. I'd appreciate the same respect in the discussion. I don't claim to have the solution. As I've just mention, I only aim to offer an open floor for discussion.

Let's focus on small scale communist experiments, and let's see whether they work or not.\n\nTheir constant premise is to deny that large scale experiments were communism, and point toward \"succesful\" small scale communist experiments, and then use [inductive reasoning](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Inductive_reasoning) to say that if it works in small scale, then we just need to figure out ways to scale it up, and then bang we will have a global communist utopia.\n\nThe only problems is that what if I could demonstrate beyond the reasonable doubt, that communism fails even in the small scale, then we could disprove communism entirely once and for all.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n---------------------\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe could analyze any small scale communist experiment, but the most factual one in my opinion was the [Kibbutz](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kibbutz) system in Israel that tried to setup utopian communist establishments, small communes basically, in order to achieve utopia.\n\nGuess what it totally failed, so much that they had to privatize everything and eliminate almost all egalitarian elements from it due to inhabitants being unhappy.\n\nNow this was well documented, so there isn't even a shred of doubt about the factuality of any this. Not like with the Spanish Revolution for instance where there was a lot of propaganda involved so we don't know clearly what happened.\n\nBut the Kibbutz phenomena was studied by tons of economists and sociologists around the world and we know exactly how things rolled out.\n\nRead the wikipedia article about their decline: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kibbutz#Decline_and_restructuring\n\nLet me review the events in a few points:\n\n* They were collective communities, \"communes\", setup since the early 1900's.\n* Traditionally they were based on farming, so they were mostly agricultural communes.\n* A lot of the settlers had socialist views so they were setup to be socialist from the beginning aimed to create a communist utopia in the area.\n* Local Arabs have started raiding the settlements frequently so most Kibbutzim have armed themselves and have become basically a self-sustainable settlement with their own defense, policing, and administration, all of it setup to be managed in an egalitarian way.\n* Local Arabs also started sabotaging the irrigation canals and started burning the crops so the Kibbutzim have formed their own military units to defend their area.\n* Jews around the world have \"crowdfunded\" money to support the Kibbutzim and many have started emigrating there to help out.\n* Early settlers had to work hard in the fields to grow enough crops to sustain themselves, but have shared everything in a very socialist way.\n* Kibbutzim grew and flourished between the 1930 and 1940, as many Jews who could escape from WW2 ended up here, by 1939 the total membership was over 24000 totalling 79 Kibbutzim.\n* They were the first establishments to have complete gender equality.\n* Up until the 1970 the egalitarian rules were very strict, people couldn't even own basic tools like kitchen appliances, all was to be shared, and since then the egalitarian aspect has been eroding more and more.\n* People dined together, worked together, and lived together, everything was done as a community.\n* To achieve women equality, kindengartens were setup to raise kids, so that women could work if they wanted to. Children didn't even lived with their parents, they all lived and slept in a separate house.\n* Kibbutznik were barely attracted to eachother, and they have preferred to marry people outside of their settlements, what is now known as the [Westermarck effect](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Westermarck_effect#Westermarck_effect).\n* There was a lot of group pressure towards conformity and nonconformists were ostracized and punished, thus crime rates were very low.\n* Even though they have all tried to achieve a self-reliant communities, they were heavily subsidized from the outside.\n\n* Most settlers were totally atheists and have rejected the Jewish religion, but only kept Jewish traditions and culture, where on holidays instead of holding religious rituals they have just danced and partied basically.\n* By the 1960 the living standards have increased faster in the Kibbutzim than in regular cities of Israel, where the Kibbutzim members had swimming pools and more luxorious lives than their counterparts (I guess this was due to the relative age of the Kibbutzim compared to  Jewish towns which were just recently built).\n* By the 1970 kibbutzniks had enjoyed full middle-class standards of lives while being working class members.\n* The decline started after 1970 where the living standards have stagnated due to the economy of agriculture being phased out and the economy of Israel becoming more diverse, a lot of kibbutzniks started moving out to get a career of their own.\n* By the 1980 the economy inside the Kibbutzim started to rapidly deteriorate leading to the [Kibbutz crisis](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kibbutz_crisis), where the debt levels of the Kibbutzim ran out of control, and they struck a negotiation with their creditors to delete some of their debts, but with conditions to restructure their economy as the current model was unsustainable.\n* After the fall of the Soviet Union socialist ideology weakened worldwide, while kibbutzniks were beginning to be exposed to \"wester\" life, each kibbutznik had a TV in their homes and started purchasing luxury goods, so the community aspect started eroding and people became more individualists.\n* Education and healthcare started to become privatized in the Kibbutzim in order to lure back professionals who had emigrated away.\n* Many kibbutznik preferred the urban lifestyle so futher emigration happened.\n* Differential wages became adopted, as wage equality no longer satisfied people, they have began paying people differently by the amount they worked.\n* Property associations became setup, which transfered the ownership of assets, like houses, from the Kibbutz into the associations, effectively privatizing homes and other land inside it.\n* The resistance to privatization while initially high, have begun to fade and people started welcoming more and more Capitalism.\n* Since the 1990s many Kibbutzim participated in the privatization and only a very few of them remained socialist, some of them were even disbanded and absorbed into the regional municipalities.\n* The new compensation models became 3 way parted: 1) one one hand equally compensated for all work, 2) mixed compensation relative to the labor they do, 3) individual income based solely on individual production, the 3rd method making up most of the income of the kibbutzniks\n* According to a  University of Haifa study 72% of the Kibbutzim began implementing individualistic rules.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---------------------------\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# So there you have it:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n* It was as close as you can get to egalitarian communism, their entire way of life was extremely collectivist and everything was shared equally. \n* It was implemented peacefully, no revolution, or any other chaos, and it evolved as naturally as it could.\n* It was small scale communism\n* **And it totally failed.** There was no external intervention or subversion, it just eroded naturally and people naturally chose the individual capitalist lifestyle over the socialist\/communist lifestyle.\n\n\nIt's the best example that you have to prove that communism is totally unfeasible. This is the best example because almost all other communist experiments happened inside a war or a revolution so you could say that a lot of external forces could influence the community.\n\nLike the [Free Territory](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Free_Territory) was beseiged by the Soviets and the [CNT](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Confederaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_del_Trabajo) was crushed by Fascist forces.\n\nBut the Kibbutzim was virtually untouched, aside from the early Arab skirmishes, so you can't even make a case that \"evil capitalists\" have influenced them.\n\nIt's just simply the kibbutznik have rationally, consciously and naturally chose the individualistic lives over the collective life. \n\nAnd even happiness has improved, people were very unhappy initially in the collectivist system and felt very unsatisfied with their lives, but as the have started the privatization, they have became more satisfied. There were [many psychology studies](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kibbutz#Psychological_aspects) on this, look it up.\n\nIt can't be any more simple that this, it's the Maslow Pyramid: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\n\nOnly Capitalism can satisfy all the needs of a human being. Self-actualization can only happen in an Individualistic Capitalistic society where people can achieve their own goals.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThere you have it, **Communism utterly disproved once and for all**.\n\n\n","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"Smallscale Communism Also Totally Failed!""num_comments":0,"score":4,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Smallscale Communism Also Totally Failed!"}

{"author":"Lepew1","created_utc":1528297726,"num_comments":30,"score":2,"selftext":"First off, I am enjoying your index of publications. I took the short quiz and am 100% with you on fiscal matters, but the rub area is on the personal side. Been reading some of the links like Bastiat, and enjoying it thoroughly. Nice resource list, thank you moderators for a fine product.\n\nHere is the part I am having trouble with\n\n&gt;- Drugs\n&gt;If there is no victim, there is no crime. If one takes away the freedom to determine one's own consumption, one destroys all freedoms. Recognizing that others are free to choose what to do with their life does not imply approval however. Vices are not good things, but they are not crimes. A free man must be able to endure it when his fellow men act and live otherwise than he considers proper.\n&gt;\"A free man must be able to endure it when his fellow men act and live otherwise than he considers proper. He must free himself from the habit, just as soon as something does not please him, of calling for the police.\"\n\nI am on board with you as long as the crime is victimless. But I think that premise fails in drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nFirst, in our present society as it exists, the cost of poor health decisions of the individual are socialized to the society as a whole. Most of us get taxed, some of which goes into Medicaid and Medicare, some of which goes to correct the health issues of those who make poor health decisions.  The bluer your state is, the more generous these benefits are likely to be.\n\nNow in order for the individual to actually grow and thrive, they must experience the negative consequences of their decisions, and I see no way in which this present state operates in which that holds. Were we in an consequences state where drug users were left to die from overdose, then this would be addressed. However we are in a society where anyone calls 911, and that person is treated, regardless of whether or not they will pay the bill. \n\nIn this current redistributive state, those who make sound health decisions and do not get in over their head financially, and pay their own way through health care problems have through redistribution their property seized and redistributed to cover the costs of your poor decisions.\n\nSo how can one be a libertarian, pushing for legalization, without at the same time pushing for direct individual health care costs, and the end of redistribution in the form of entitlement?\n\nNext we have the costs on the family of this drug use. Go to an AA meeting sometime and you will see that an addict tends to leave a wake of destruction through people's lives. How can we in good conscience call this victimless? The very people who love you most are hurt the most, used the most, abused the most while the addict is in the throws of addiction.\n\nNext comes the sticky problem of operating machinery while impaired. I can understand an argument of punishing those who make poor decisions here, by driving drunk or drugged, but sometimes those decisions take human life, the ultimate loss in liberty of others, and there is no way to atone or repair that damage. When the drug itself impairs decision making, is it wise to assume good decision making will take place if that drug is legalized? I personally want to be judged by my own actions and not be penalized for statistical outcomes that I have not chosen, but I also want to drive and live in a society where people make responsible decisions and do not drive impaired. What then is your hand and hand proposal that comes with legalization to increase in a major way responsible drug use? Clearly the existing system of parenting and schools and self education does not achieve a level of responsibility people are happy with.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Question to the board on the victimless crime of drug use"}

{"author":"TXSenatorTedCruz","created_utc":1528325673,"num_comments":7,"score":2,"selftext":"CERN, which stands for  European Organization for Nuclear Research in English, [is a research organization that operates the largest particle physics laboratory in the world](https:\/\/home.cern\/about). It is mostly know for the Large Hadron Collider, [which is a particle collider that  allow physicists to test the predictions of different theories of particle physics including measuring the properties of the Higgs boson and searching for the large family of new particles predicted by supersymmetric theories](https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/technology\/Large-Hadron-Collider).\n\n[CERN is financed by 21 member states, which each contribute various amounts totaling 1,240 million Swiss francs in 2013](https:\/\/voisins.cern\/en\/en-bref\/who-funds-cerns-research). [In 2016, the budget was of 1127.2 million Swiss francs](https:\/\/press.cern\/facts-and-figures\/budget-overview). [The Large Hadron Collider took about a decade to construct, with a total cost of about $4.75 billion USD. Since turning on in 2008, the total cost of finding the Higgs boson has been about $13.25 billion USD](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alexknapp\/2012\/07\/05\/how-much-does-it-cost-to-find-a-higgs-boson\/#7e28d07c3948).\n\nThe work CERN does is absolutely complex and requires a ton of money to finance. Regardless of if it does important work or not, should taxpayers be burdened with its finance? Would private money be a more beneficial financing method?\n\nThis question is something I came up with while spending some time in r\/space, where I asked [if space exploration should be taxpayer financed while there are so many homeless, shitty schools and crumbling infrastructure in the US](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/space\/comments\/8p1bej\/pew_research_72_of_americans_think_it_is\/e08cn82\/?context=3). I got a lot of responses by really defensive people and was downvoted, but I was wondering what you all thought of the question of financing CERN (and for that matter NASA if you're so inclined to engage).\n\nI think its an interesting question because there are currently privately financed space exploration projects going on, most famously [SpaceX](http:\/\/www.spacex.com\/), [Blue Origin](https:\/\/www.blueorigin.com\/) and [Virgin Galactic](https:\/\/www.virgingalactic.com\/). They seemed to have a business model based on future commercial space flights, launching satellites and space colonization projects. The work CERN does doesn't seem, at least on the face of it, to have much of a commercial demand. At least not now. (I could be wrong though)\n\nWith all of the inequality and poor government services that there is within the 21 member states ([poor healthcare services in the UK](https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/2017\/05\/18\/nhs-care-among-worst-europe\/) and [the rest of the EU](https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/2017\/05\/18\/nhs-care-among-worst-europe\/) for example), is there a practical reason why taxpayers should have to foot the bill?\n\nSo, thoughts? I am really curious what you guys think.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Should CERN be government financed?"}

As a Democratic Socialist, I've found that we share much of the same moral and ideological grounds and want many of the same things, but the divisive factor is that we feel they should be achieved in completely different ways.\n\n In a nutshell, I feel that the systems that we all want to see (universal healthcare, basic income, disability insurance, worker-focused protections) will only be achievable if forced upon the populace by the government, because - as individuals - the majority are too selfish and would not willingly provide for those that cannot provide for themselves. To the contrary, my friends believe that these economic gaps would be filled by private industry, provided the market had time to grow and the need for such services existed, thus following the most basic tenant of the Libertarian system.\n\nAt a basic level, it is my belief that - by definition - Libertarianism would, in time, lead to a morally corrupt, capitalist system not too different from the class-based societies of the past in which the proletariat was suppressed by those with the majority of the wealth. To a lesser degree, this can be seen in any capitalist society, including our own.\n\nAs a result of this, the only logical way that one could believe that Libertarian policies would be successful is if every single citizen had an individual desire to contribute to society in a way that was intrinsically motivated, as technically - the moment extrinsic factors are introduced - they are being coerced and fundamental tenants of the system are broken.\n_____\n\n&gt; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

{"author":"aepryus","created_utc":1528377286,"num_comments":13,"score":26,"selftext":"Motive:  \nWhy is Libertarianism a good idea?  Often times Libertarians will reference the N.A.P.; the non-aggression principle [ https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Non-aggression_principle ] as the basis for Libertarianism.  But, why is the NAP a good idea?  Why does it work?  And is the NAP the broadest possible starting point for Libertarian ideology?\n\nAgent:  \nAn agent* is any entity in the universe that:\n\n* has the ability to perceive the universe (i.e., inputs)\n* has the ability to act upon the universe (i.e., outputs)\n* is able to make decisions based on those inputs attempting to affect specific outputs.\n\nGiven this definition any individual belonging to a species of the Animal Kingdom could be considered an agent.  However, agents themselves can group together and form entities.  For example, an ant colony could be considered an agent.  Similarly, numerous human groupings such as a nation, party, religion, company or family could be considered an agent**.\n\nIn any universe, in order for any agent to persist it must act in its own self interest.  The law of natural selection says that agents that work in their own self interest will tend to persist; agents that do not act in their own self interest will tend to disappear.\n\nValue:  \nIn order for an agent to make any decisions it must be able to assign value to an output.  Once various outputs are assigned values an agent can then use the inputs it receives in order to decide how to act on the universe in a way to obtain the outputs it wants.  Value is simply a measure of amount of desire for a given output that an agent contains.\n\nAny agent has the ability to create value; to create something from nothing.\n\nInterface:  \nIt is possible for two agents to interface with one another by exchanging value.  This exchange allows for the total value to increase by allowing each entity to exchange something of lesser value (to them) for something of greater value (to them).\n\nAn interface is maximally efficient (the greatest amount of value is created) when both agents engage in the interface entirely voluntarily.  As an interface becomes encumbered for one or both of the agents the interface loses efficiency and the amount of value created becomes less than the maximum possible.  In order to maximize the value created with an interface it is necessary to remove all encumbrances.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a concrete example; in Kurosawa\u2019s Seven Samurai a group of brigands fall upon a small village in order to steal their crops.  This is an interface between the brigands and the villagers.  The brigands are free to engage in this interface or not, but the villagers are given no choice but to engage in the interface.  As a result the interface is highly inefficient.  The villagers toil in their fields in order to create value.\n\nBut, the brigands do not create anything of value themselves.  Furthermore, in this case, the villagers decide to defend themselves.  That time spent training and preparing to fight, is not spent creating value.  So, much time and effort that could have been spent towards creating value is instead put towards non-productive endeavors or in the case of the brigands not put towards anything at all.  The end result of all this is a highly inefficient interface caused by the lack of voluntary association.\n\nAs such, the non aggression principal is easily derived as a single instance of an encumbered interface.  Violence or the threat of violence is just one way an interface can become encumbered.  Another way is for an entity to gain monopoly control of a necessary resource.  Once an agent becomes the sole source of a required resource all agents that are in need of that resource must have encumbered interfaces with that controlling agent.\n\nBreakdown of the Interface:  \nAny interface can be broken down to 6 parts.  In an interface there are two sides; each side has  1: the payer, 2: the receiver and 3: the decider.\n\nAn individual is an agent, but an individual can be a component of other agents as well, such as a company or a country, etc.  As such, it is possible for the 3 parts of a side of an interface to be spread out among multiple agents.\n\nAn interface is maximally efficient when it is between two agents with each agent being confined to one side of the interface.  Once an interface is spread among multiple agents or an agent isn\u2019t confined to one side of the interface, the interface\u2019s efficiency suffers.  Let\u2019s look at some examples.\n  \n  \n* In an ideal situation the interface looks as follows:\n\nRole | Side 1 | Side 2\n-------|-------|-------\npayer | agent A | agent B\nreceiver | agent A | agent B\ndecider | agent A | agent B\n  \n  \n* Here is the breakdown of the above case of the brigands and the villagers:\n\nRole | Side 1 | Side 2\n-------|-------|-------\npayer | villagers (crops) | none\nreceiver | none | brigands\ndecider | brigands | brigands\n\nThis is clearly a highly inefficient interface.\n  \n  \n* An employee is sent to New York for a project.  He is on an expense account and staying at hotel.  He decides to call room service and order a club sandwich and a coke.  The bill is $40.\n\nRole | Side 1 | Side 2\n-------|-------|-------\npayer | employer ($40) | hotel (sandwich and coke)\nreceiver | employee | hotel\ndecider | employee | hotel\n\nSimply by swapping out the employer for the employee in this interface the transaction becomes wildly inefficient ($40 for a $10 meal).  The hotel can charge $40 because they know most of their guests are on expense accounts.  The employee decides to buy the sandwich because they are not paying for it.\n  \n  \n* A child sets out to buy his father a father\u2019s day gift.\n\nRole | Side 1 | Side 2\n-------|-------|-------\npayer | child ($10) | store (ugly tie)\nreceiver | father | store\ndecider | child | store\n\nThis time swapping out the receiver instead of the payer has a similarly inefficient result.  The father receives an ugly tie, something he would never spend $10 on for himself.\n\n* An employed American falls ill and needs to go to the hospital.\n\nFirst off, we need to deal with health insurance:\n\nRole | Side 1 | Side 2\n-------|-------|-------\npayer | employer ($1000\/mo) | insurer (insurance)\nreceiver | employee | insurer\ndecider | employer | insurer\n\nAnd then we need to go to the doctor:\n\nRole | Side 1 | Side 2\n-------|-------|-------\npayer | insurer ($36,000) | doctor (medical care)\nreceiver | employee | doctor\ndecider | employee and doctor | doctor\n\nHealthcare in the United States, as it stands, suffers from a spectacularly inefficient interface.  First instead of being a single interface, it is two interfaces glued together.  And each of those interfaces is inefficient in itself.  The first leg suffering from the ugly tie inefficiency and the second leg suffering from the expense account inefficiency.  But, in addition to those three problems, most patients are not going to have the knowledge necessary to make informed decisions and so the doctor will have sizable input as a decider on the other side of the interface.\n\nIn total this creates 4 major inefficiencies in the healthcare interface.  In order to solve the healthcare crisis in the United States it is necessary to remove each of those 4 inefficiencies.\n  \n  \n_* Certainly, this is not a rigorous definition.  It is questionable whether a rigorous definition of anything is possible outside of the field of mathematics.  Perhaps, a \u201cmore\u201d rigorous definition is possible, but that is beyond the scope of this post.\n\n** Again, a full explanation of this statement is beyond the scope of this post, but perhaps the Searle Chinese Room is a good starting point for exploring this idea.

{"author":"CanadianAsshole1","created_utc":1528430129,"num_comments":5,"score":1,"selftext":"For those of you who don't know, the province of Ontario in Canada just had an election to choose our leader, the Premier(the equivalent of your Governors). The competition was between the Conservative Party led by Doug Ford(the brother of the infamous crack\\-addict mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford), and the NDP, a far\\-left social democratic party led by Andrea Horwath. Our previous government, Kathleen Wynne and her Liberals, were extremely unpopular and had no chance of winning.\n\nFord's personal life was riddled with numerous controversies. I don't approve of his Trump style populism. His platform wasn't really clear and fully costed. He is also very strongly pro\\-life, which I don't agree with. To be very clear: I don't like him that much.\n\nHowever, electing their opponents would be choosing socialism, and I could never live with that.\n\n* Our province is billions of dollars in debt after our previous leader's corruption and mismanagement, yet they want to continue this irresponsible deficit spending, all while raising taxes on corporations and the top earners, which are already cripplingly high.\n* They are buddy\\-buddy with the labour unions, and they would refuse to use back\\-to\\-work legislation, which is a law that allows the government to end strikes. This would allow the teachers, hospital workers, garbage collectors, and all other public sector unions to hold us hostage to satisfy their greed for money.\n* Steep carbon taxes, because fuck cars and mobility rights amirite? The left wants complete control over where people go, and they try to achieve that by pushing the \"muh public transportion\" rhetoric.\n* Making life more expensive for everyone else, and potentially bankrupting business owners, by raising the minimum wage to $15. In what world does someone deserve that much money for flipping burgers?\n* Don't forget subsidized child\\-care, because for some reason taxpayers should be responsible for paying for the life choices of others\n* YAY, MORE SOCIALIZED HEALTHCARE!!!!! Now they want to extend coverage to medicine and dental care. In other words, if you don't take care of your teeth or your body, I'm paying the price for treatment. For whatever reason, \"medicine\" also includes hormone therapy for trans folk. All paid for by the ~~extortion~~ \"generosity\" of taxpayers.\n* No leftist political party would be complete without identity politics and woman\\-pandering obviously.\n\n*Andrea Horwath and the NDP will update and enforce the Pay Equity Act to address the gender wage gap, and bring greater equity to corporate boards so that women have better economic opportunities, fairer incomes and face fewer barriers.*\n\n\\*We will apply an intersectional gender lens \u2014 an understanding of how issues like gender and race can interact to dramatically change the way people\u2019s lives are affected \u2014 to government budgeting, policy and programming. \\*\n\n\\*We will fund 10 days of paid leave for women escaping violence, and ensure they can access additional leave if they need it without fear of repercussions at work. \\*\n\n*We will properly fund women\u2019s shelters and transitional housing, and ensure there are services and programs available to help women recover from partner violence and abuse. And we will set aside a portion of the 65,000 units of affordable housing we are building for women and their families escaping violence.*\n\nI guess the 1\/2 of domestic violence which are men don't matter......\n\n**Compare this to Doug Ford's promises of fiscal conservatism and tax cuts, this was a no\\-brainer for me. And I am glad my fellow Ontarians felt the same way, because the socialists lost, and the Conservative party will form our next government.**","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The province of Ontario in Canada just had an election today.

But sulfazine is like a drill boring into your body that gets worse and worse until it\u2019s more than you can stand. It\u2019s impossible to endure.

The line of reasoning that the one guy used was that the state cannot fund any religion in any capacity, even if it does so for every available religion. And by funding any religion, even if you are funding multiple religions (completely not accounting for atheism here, which is its own issue), then you are ipso facto endorsing those religions and implicated in the affairs of those. Thus, the only way for the government to truly endorse freedom of religion is to remove itself entirely from the process.\n\nWhich makes sense, and it is an argument I have heard countless times before and agree with wholeheartedly. But for some reason this time, hearing this led me to think about what the rest of the First Amendment has to say. If we take it that our freedom of speech is the cornerstone of our democracy: we need to be able to freely speak our minds in order to think properly and sufficiently as individuals (and subsequently act), which is the essence of democracy's intentions. Then the government must not endorse any thought process (read: contents and methods of teaching) if it is to truly embody freedom of speech.\n\nSo under a similar thought process with regard to church and state, wouldn't a government-sponsored school system complete with set curricula be equivalent to sponsoring one religion over another. If the government should be rightly removed from religious affairs (and I suppose similar logic should apply to state-run media for the same reason), why should the government be directly involved in supporting any line of thinking (for example, common core)?\n\nI'm not sure if this is something most of you have already thought about or if it is already a common thought process, though I didn't really see much about it in my search of this sub.

I'm a strong believer in ideological diversity being applied to solving societal problems.\n\nLikewise, I'm curious what a few of you think about universal basic income - but after you do things like cut other social programs that it would replace, i.e. medicaid, medicare, and generally keep taxes around where they're at. The idea would be to create an equal opportunity system, but not a complete social safety net. I.e. maybe it would be in the range of averaging 8k a year for 30-50%.\n\nIt actually reminds me of the voucher program for education: create more of a market for things like health insurance, reduce the centralization and bureaucracy of things like Obamacare.\n\nAt a certain income level, you'd have your UBI taxed out, so it would be simpler to opt out of it and not have it taxed later. The reduction in the UBI would happen in the range of 20k to 60k so that you'd always be motivated to seek a higher salary.\n\nBut it also wouldn't be enough for comfort so that you're motivated, but perhaps less existentially bothered. It would also make it a bit easier for people to start businesses.\n\nThen the minimum wage could also be lowered or even eliminated. A lot of bureaucracy, control and waste could be eliminated since the system would be balanced out by existing infrastructure given the current tax system.\n\nIf 150 million people got 8k a year on average, that would cost 1.2 trillion a year. Given the size of things like medicare, welfare, medicade and obamacare, you might actually save money by replacing it all with UBI instead. The budget is on an order of 4 trillion dollars, so, by cutting a lot of things you could actually implement a UBI and probably get more into the economy.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Universal Basic Income"}

He's a really good guy, and I plan on voting for him and donating money to him in his mayoral race in November. He's an ideal Libertarian candidate both in terms of philosophy, messaging, and delivery, at least for me. I also think he's done a great job growing the party since he took over.\n\nThat being said, I think if we want to take that next step as a party, it's time for a chance. Joshua Smith will likely be on the final ballot vs Nick, and I plan on supporting Smith for the following three reasons...\n\n\n1. So we can reach out to small \"l\" libertarians\n\nRight now, there a ton of libertarians out there who are not members of the party. If we want to grow, we need to unify the liberty movement as much as we can. Unfortunately, Sarwark has burned too many bridges in this regard. Prominent small \"l\" libertarians like Tom Woods, Jason Stapleton, Lions of Liberty, and Ron Paul are not Sarwark fans. I personally disagree with all of them and think they are being stubborn and arrogant, but we need them and their supporters to grow as a party. The only way to bring those people over is a chance in leadership.\n\n2. Smith has a new energy\n\nOnce again, I think Sarwark did really good things for the party. But he seems complacent right now. He's been touting Gary's 3% as a success, and by pure numerical metrics, it was. But given the circumstances, it was a disappointment. We need someone like Smith that is willing to aim higher. Someone that won't be satisfied until we get real wins. Sure, some of his goals are too lofty. But shooting for the stars and falling short is better than being fine with irrelevancy.\n\n3. His 4-point plan\n\nCheck it out. I would also check out his interviews on the Tom Woods show. Also the debate on Lions of Liberty. He has real ideas to grow this party. Some are too far fetched in my eyes. But a lot are reasonable and can bring much needed energy into this party.\n\nBonus: Larry Sharpe endorsed him\n\nIf Larry thinks this is the man that can take the party to the next level, who am I to doubt him?\n\nTlDR: I'm endorsing Smith because he can unify small l libertarians, being new energy, and has a good plan.\n\nI'd love to here your thoughts.

Most people want some government services, and thus they do consent to some of their taxes. Even libertarians usually consent to taxation for police and military at a bare minimum.\n\nAnd when the government takes your money, and you consent to it, it *isn't* theft. Thus, \"taxation is theft\" is not always completely true. Its validity differs for every person, based on how much of their own taxes that they consent to.\n\nMaybe I consent to some tax for our military for national defense, but not all the tax that gets spend blowing up the Middle East. Maybe I consent to gas tax to fix the roads, but not property tax to pay for somebody else's kids to get free schooling.\n\nAlmost everyone consents to *some* taxes, but almost nobody consents to *all* taxes.\n\nThus, \"taxation is theft\" is too simple. In order to make a universally true statement, you have to add the qualifier that only non-consensual taxation is theft. Telling someone \"taxation is theft\" may not actually be true for them, if they consent to all their current taxes, which is why many leftwing people oppose the statement so much (because we know how much they love taxes).

These companies control large blocks of phone numbers. This information is paid for by robocallers, who then pay call centers to spam people with phone calls. Most people have caller ID. When you receive these calls, your service provider is forced to pay a caller ID database to display that information. The database pays the number dealer, who then completes the devious cycle by giving the robocallers a cut of the money. So theoretically, the more calls a robocaller makes the more money they take in, even if no one actually picks up the phone.\n\nIn this particular example, the market incentivizes behavior that is inherently bothersome to all. The profits are realized though an abuse of an extremely useful system (caller ID) which we, as consumers, cannot really control through simple market behavior.\n\nLet us assume an idealized scenario, where robocallers provide no benefit to anyone at all. My question is this: **In your opinion, would a situation like this merit government intervention?** If so, how much?

Supporters of big-govt want to use big-govt to solve a problem created by big-govt.\n\n\n-------------------\n#'Certificates of Need' are a protectionist regulation used by big-hospital to collude against patients in need of care and push out good doctors in smaller clinics, while restricting the supply of medical equipment and medical facilities\n-------------------\n\n&gt;\"CON laws appear to raise a particularly substantial barrier to entry and expansion of competitors because they create an opportunity for existing competitors to exploit procedural opportunities to thwart or delay new competition. Such behavior, commonly called \"rent seeking\" conduct, is a well-recognized consequence of regulatory intervention in the market. Essentially, an existing competitor uses the hearing and appeals process to cause substantial delays, leading both the existing competitor and the new entrant to divert significant funds away from delivering healthcare and to spend them on legal fees, consulting fees, and lobbying efforts. Moreover, much of this conduct, even if exclusionary and anticompetitive, is unlikely to be subject to legal challenge as a violation of the antitrust laws because it involves petitioning of the state government by the existing competitor. Indeed, during our hearings, we received evidence of the widespread recognition that existing competitors use the CON process \"to forestall competitors from entering an incumbent's market.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;#A third example comes from the State of Vermont. There, home health agencies entered into territorial market allocations, again under cover of the state regulatory program, to give each other exclusive geographic markets. That state's CON laws prevented competitive entry, which normally might have disciplined such cartel behavior. We found that Vermont consumers were paying higher prices than were consumers in states where home health agencies competed against each other.\n&gt;\n&gt;We have learned from these matters and others that CON laws have the potential to impede competition in ways well beyond what is intended by their supporters. \n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;My remarks are intended to convey to you our belief that CON laws impose substantial costs on consumers and healthcare markets.\n&gt;\n&gt;...\n&gt;\n&gt;We are unaware of evidence that those states which have eliminated CON laws have suffered such harm. The studies, cited above, in fact suggest that elimination of CON laws leads to improved markets. Accordingly, we encourage you to consider carefully whether the maintenance of those laws or the enactment of new ones best serves your citizens.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.justice.gov\/atr\/competition-healthcare-and-certificates-need\n\n&gt;\"It is no coincidence that most vociferous opponents of CON repeal are hospitals and other incumbent healthcare providers. The current system allows them to have a monopoly on certain healthcare services in their area and they benefit enormously from the system.\n&gt;\n&gt;One hospital industry respondent to a National Institute for Healthcare Reform Study reported \u201cmember hospitals initially had mixed views about the benefits of CON but banded together to support the process after realizing it was a valuable tool to block new physician-owned facilities.\u201d\"\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nccivitas.org\/2011\/certificate-of-need-does-it-actually-control-healthcare-costs\/\n\n&gt;\"Dr. Mark Monteferrante didn\u2019t think it would be so hard to help his radiology group\u2019s office in Northern Virginia buy a second MRI machine in 2003.\n&gt;\n&gt;But it took five years and more than $175,000 in lawyers\u2019 and other fees to get that second machine. The reason? Virginia\u2019s certificate-of -need law, which requires owners of medical facility-care projects to prove public need and get approval for their projects before embarking upon them.\n&gt;\n&gt;The program is meant to contain healthcare costs, but Monteferrante argues it hurts patients by stifling competition.

A RAND Corporation report studying the effects of expanding practice to APRNs in Ohio showed an increase in health care access and use. It also showed that costs will decrease for services that nurses and doctors both provide. Permitting APRNs to practice autonomously in other states should yield similar results. This would fulfill many outcomes politicians are seeking without any negatives.\n&gt;\n&gt;Unfortunately, doctors\u2019 lobbies call the change dangerous despite its widespread success, in order to protect themselves from competition. Nobel-Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman explained that licensing laws harm medical service because when physicians are deciding who gets to be a physician, they try to keep out as much competition as possible to increase their average income.\"\n\nhttp:\/\/thefederalist.com\/2017\/09\/19\/these-4-free-market-reforms-will-solve-the-healthcare-crisis-without-the-negatives-of-obamacare\/\n\n&gt;\"Traditional Braces cost on average $5,000.

While meetings of FDA advisory panels are public, most other discussions and negotiations that figure prominently into FDA decisions involve only FDA employees and drug industry representatives, with the FDA outmanned and out-financed by industry. A single FDA officer generally has major responsibility for the approval of a drug in a process that involves negotiation with a host of industry physicians, scientists, lawyers, and marketing experts over a number of years. This psychologically, scientifically, and financially imbalanced relationship and the absence of other parties forces the FDA to ration its demands and puts the agency at risk of being captured by the economic interests it regulates.2 We recommend additional measures to prevent regulatory capture and to improve the independent analysis of postmarketing adverse events.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamainternalmedicine\/fullarticle\/412111\n\n&gt;\"Deregulating the FDA Approval Process\n&gt;\n&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval policies put lives at risk more directly than any of the other examples do, because they deny Americans life-saving medication.\n&gt;\n&gt;\u201cBy a conservative estimate, FDA delays in allowing U.S. marketing of drugs used safely and effectively elsewhere around the world have cost the lives of at least 200,000 Americans over the past 30 years,\u201d Robert Goldberg of Brandeis University said, according to the Cato Institute.\n&gt;\n&gt;One example is the FDA\u2019s sluggish approval of a pulmonary fibrosis drug called pirfenidone.

So I started reading his book \"Basic Economics\" and have been loving it. \n\nBased on my reading of the early chapters I started questioning the value of rent-control, and minimum wage laws. I've spent the weekend diving deeper into rent-control specifically and am finding myself quite convinced by the libertarian and free-market arguments that rent-control (and price fixing in general) are harmful. \n\nMy first question as I dive deeper libertarian pure free-market economic policy is what stops the exploitation of workers (child labor, 7 day work weeks, etc). These used to exist in America, and laws were passed to stop them. Why didn't the free-market stop these exploitative practices? Were there forces at play that somehow countered the free-market and created these terrible working conditions? I can imagine a simple argument that through competition skilled workers will go to the company that treats them best, and thus the market would naturally lead to agreeable working conditions, but if that is the case then why did these conditions exist previously in America? \n\nI have much more reading ahead, but wanted to see if anyone could steer more towards additional literature or historic context that shows how pure free markets wouldn't be exploitative to some degree. Greatly looking forward to learning more, and appreciate any guidance. Maybe I'm a libertarian in the making... \n\nFor context, I've been a democrat all my life.

This is America\u2019s responsibility for facilitating mid-air refueling, crucial intelligence support, imperative naval support for the Saudi blockade.  We all have the power to see it end, if only we have the courage to resist the warfare state.*\n\nThe United Arab Emirates has an impending, and what looks like officially \u201cunofficial\u201d, siege on the port in Hodeida, Yemen.  This port to the Red Sea is the last vestige of global food markets to Yemen, a country with 8.4 million people living at risk of starvation.  These are some of the oldest civilizations living today, and some of the poorest people on earth and America\u2019s coalition war with UAE and Riyadh has made them even poorer.   \n\nDuring the last three years, starvation and drone strikes have been a way of life for millions of Yemenis.  Among this was last years monsoon season which carried with it a cholera outbreak which was exacerbated by lack of sustenance and clean drinking water.  \n\nFigures range anywhere from 10k-40k have died as a result of what Muhammad Bin Salman infamously called \u201cOperation Decisive Storm\u201d and was planned on being a one-and-done decapitation and install a Saudi satellite government.  Arguments on the Saudi side cite spurious claims of Iranian involvement in the Houthi capture of the capital of Sanaa in 2014.  This is blatant obfuscation.  Iran warned the Houthis of just this consequence, because they knew for certain that Saudi would spare no time blaming Iran for such a coup d\u2019etat.\n\nThe US\/Saudi coalition strikes have destroyed Houthi territory in the north.  For this reason, Houthis have no home, thus nothing left to live for, so in Hodeida where they will die fighting.  This siege will continue the bloodshed and the starvation.\n\nBelow is one piece of evidence of many which exposes the humanitarian facade of the American empire.  Here are your angels, the deities beyond reproach who we have trusted to be sole arbiters of security and justice on a global scale.  Shame on all of us for sitting aside and watching it happen.\n\n\u201cAmong other reasons, the White House needed to **placate the Saudis as the administration completed a nuclear deal with Iran**, Saudi Arabia\u2019s archenemy. That fact alone eclipsed concerns among **many of the president\u2019s advisers that the Saudi-led offensive would be long, bloody and indecisive**.\n\nMr. Obama soon gave his approval for the Pentagon to support the impending military campaign.\n\nA year later, the war has been a humanitarian disaster for Yemen and a study in the perils of the Obama administration\u2019s push to get Middle Eastern countries to take on bigger military roles in their neighborhood. Thousands of Yemeni civilians have been killed, many by Saudi jets flying too high to accurately deliver the bombs to their targets. Peace talks have been stalled for months. American spy agencies have concluded that **Yemen\u2019s branch of Al Qaeda has only grown more powerful in the chaos**.\u201d\n\nSource: https:\/\/mobile.nytimes.com\/2016\/03\/14\/world\/middleeast\/yemen-saudi-us.amp.html","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"In regards to the impending UAE attack on the Red Sea port on the coast of Hodeida, Yemen"}

Of course poll after poll shows that taxpayers and private property owners are against open borders and mass immigration. Therefore because immigrants travel on public property that is jointly owned by private property owners that do not want them their. it is therefore voailitng the sovereignty of the private property owners. It is therefore coercion against private property owners and is violating the nap. Worst of all anti discrimination laws when combined with open borders violate the nap further. Of course we all know that welfare is worse for these situations, but what I want to say is that even without a welfare state. Mass immigration and open borders can still not be justified. As it voailtes the NAP by having immigrants go onto public property that is jointly owned and payed for by private property owners that most likely do not want them there.\n\nMy second argument is the cultural argument that letting in immigrants on mass with no assimilation process creates cultural dustruction. It is known the libertarianism has been successful in the west due to the core western values that have been built over the centuries. It is this culture that has allowed libertarianism to survive. What many libertarians cannot understand is that some cultures like Islam are Just incompatible with the west and libertarianism ie cultural relativism and multiculturalism are bullshit. You need a core culture to maintain a civilization, high social trust, and have healthy society with values and costums that everyone can relate to. this will form more solidarity between people and decreased want for statism as community is put first over the state.

Russians claim exclusive sovereignty over Crimea and do not accept Ukrainian\u2019s involvement. Likewise, Ukraine claims exclusive sovereignty over Crimea and condemns Russian annexation. Meanwhile, Crimean are under\u00a0de facto\u00a0Russian sovereignty and\u00a0de jure\u00a0Ukrainian sovereignty. Evidently, Russians would not accept Ukrainians and Ukrainians would not accept Russians in any negotiations about the sovereignty over Crimea. Regardless of their rhetorical arguments which will only guarantee an endless dispute and legal and political limbo for the inhabitants of the disputed territory, do these opposing parties have any grounds for their claim? Do they have what I call a \u201ccolourable claim\u201d to go into negotiations?\n\nIn domestic law (and this is applicable to international relations too) before going into the negotiations to solve any conflict it is imperative to decide who will be able to be part of them. In other words, who is a legitimate claiming party? This has to do with the \u201cadmissibility\u201d steps prior to any negotiation or discussion. In simple terms, if I do not recognise you to have right to claim over \u201cX\u201d I will not discuss who owns \u201cX.\u201d So far this long standing difference has been in a legal and political limbo. Yet, if we were finally reasonable and wanted a peaceful end to the dispute, who counts?\n\nIn discussing the colourable claim and Crimea we have included first the historical claim and showed how the \"same\" facts are perceived differently by different parties in the dispute and by other regional and international agents. Secondly,  we referred to law and we reviewed some key documents such as the Budapest memorandum. The links to the latest posts below.

Basically, the laws caused prices to rise and made it harder to get, so people with chronic pain or addicted to opiates began to move on to heroin because it\u2019s much cheaper and requires little more than a phone call. \n\nIf we correlate this with the fact that [states with legalized cannabis have seen a 25% decrease in opiate overdose deaths](https:\/\/jamanetwork.com\/journals\/jamainternalmedicine\/fullarticle\/1898878), it seems to me that people generally want to be healthy and they don\u2019t want to be hopeless heroin addicts. \n\nOpiates like heroin and OxyContin come from the poppy plant, which is a Schedule II substance in the Controlled Substance Act. Imagine if people were free to grow their own cannabis, as well as poppy to make a less addictive and dangerous, but highly effective, form of opium. Chronic pain sufferers could grow their own medicine and dose it according to their needs, and addicts would have little reason to steal to support their habit.\n\nI\u2019ll end this with a quote from August Vollmer, founder of the School of Criminology at University of California and former president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, in 1936:\n\n&gt;\u201cStringent laws, spectacular police drives, vigorous prosecution, and imprisonment of addicts and peddlers have proved not only useless and enormously expensive as means of correcting this evil, but they are also unjustifiably and unbelievably cruel in their application to the unfortunate drug victims. Repression has driven this vice underground and produced the narcotic smugglers and supply agents, who have grown wealthy out of this evil practice and who, by devious methods, have stimulated traffic in drugs. Finally, and not the least of the evils associated with repression, the helpless addict has been forced to resort to crime in order to get money for the drug which is absolutely indispensable for his comfortable existence...\n\n&gt;...Drug addiction, like prostitution, and like liquor, is not a police problem; it never has been, and never can be solved by policemen. It is first and last a medical problem, and if there is a solution it will be discovered not by policemen, but by scientific and competently trained medical experts whose sole objective will be the reduction and possible eradication of this devastating appetite. There should be intelligent treatment of the incurables in outpatient clinics, hospitalization of those not too far gone to respond to therapeutic measures, and application of the prophylactic principles which medicine applies to all scourges of mankind.\u201d\n","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"Legalize ALL drugs""num_comments":0,"score":6,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Legalize ALL drugs"}

If we take people from countries so poor that they don\u2019t have housing, food, and water and they will probably die, why not let them enter into a lifetime contract? Imagine your village has run out of food and water. Within weeks people will start to die. Now picture that a rich American swoops in to save the village. All this humble businessman wants is to give the entire village food water and housing in America. Unfortunately he can\u2019t just give that away they will need to work. They obviously will choose the better life in America over starving. This job is probably the best thing to ever happen to them. They finally have some luxury. If one bought a warehouse and filled it to the brim with plywood bunks you could fill it with quite a lot of people. Each person will work minimum wage jobs and some will work on the company farm for the groups food. If we are able to ship 100,000 people over and they all work for 10 dollars an hour you would make over two billion a year before tax. 2 billion a year is more than enough to take care of 100,000 people and pay for the shipping and handling. You would also provide great opportunities to their children. Since they will be born in the USA and not in a contract they will be allowed to go to public high school and have the chance to stay with their parents in the contract or they can find somewhere else to live. If they stay they will have the chance to get better jobs with their degree and depending on their pay grade we can upgrade their living conditions. They will most likely work much harder than other natives because they are grateful and they don\u2019t need to hike miles for water.

Discuss, all ideas are welcome:\n\nI have a pretty innovative idea that I touched on in episode 3 of my podcast. With the earth slowly dying we need to get ahead of the curve of upcoming environmental issues while still creating wealth. We need to avoid the tragedy of the commons with precious oxygen. \n\nThis is why I propose the idea of privatizing air rights. What you could do is divide the country into air rights territories, and sell them off to productive job creators. If a consumer wishes to breath in a certain air territory, they only need to register their neck bound breathing monitor and pay a free market rate for the volume of oxygen they consume. (Don\u2019t worry about price gouging, in this free market, you are free to move to a different, lower priced territory) This way you have a free market, tax free solution to the depletion of oxygen on Earth (while encouraging free loaders with yet another reason to get a job and encouraging job creating scientists to artificially generate O2).\n\n-Albert Fairfax II","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Tragedy of the Commons: How we can prepare for the future"}

Eventually, all the suitable spots are privately owned and the dams built. There is competition among the various dam owners but eventually they agree to service different parts of the country or merge when they are too close to each other. \n\nElectricity production is cheap, but with no competition they raise prices. Seeing this, other people raise funds and create conventual power generating plants, but when this happens the dam owners reduce prices to below the breakeven point for the new power plants (they have higher costs because they need inputs) and run them out of the business. Once this happens, the dam owners buy these power plants for pennies on the dollar and then raise their rates again.\n\nMy understanding is that a libertarian solution to this problem is to organize people in the affected communities to commit to buying power only from a conventional power provider (even when cheaper rates are on offer from the dam owners). At some point, these rational people who have committed to buying power from the conventional providers will force the dam owners out of business. In the future, the dam owners will know they must offer competitive rates all the time or fall victim to this all over again.\n\nIs there any other libertarian solution to this problem?

{"author":"WKCIA","created_utc":1529025738,"num_comments":1,"score":5,"selftext":"So everyone knows Eric Arthur Blair's two big works - *Animal Farm* and *1984*. What may require a little more research is Orwell's *essays*, of which he wrote a great many and was a master of that particular art.\n\nWhat I want to put up for discussion is his essay, *Charles Dickens*, to which I put the following [link](http:\/\/orwell.ru\/library\/reviews\/dickens\/english\/e_chd).\n\nIt is this passage that I want to quote in parts which is my main point for discussion:\n\n&gt;It seems that in every attack Dickens makes upon society he is always pointing to a change of spirit rather than a change of structure. It is hopeless to try and pin him down to any definite remedy, still more to any political doctrine. His approach is always along the moral plane, and his attitude is sufficiently summed up in that remark about Strong's school being as different from Creakle's \u2018as good is from evil\u2019. Two things can be very much alike and yet abysmally different. Heaven and Hell are in the same place. Useless to change institutions without a \u2018change of heart\u2019 \u2014 that, essentially, is what he is always saying.\n\n&gt; If that were all, he might be no more than a cheer-up writer, a reactionary humbug. A \u2018change of heart\u2019 is in fact the alibi of people who do not wish to endanger the status quo. But Dickens is not a humbug, except in minor matters, and the strongest single impression one carries away from his books is that of a hatred of tyranny. I said earlier that Dickens is not in the accepted sense a revolutionary writer. But it is not at all certain that a merely moral criticism of society may not be just as \u2018revolutionary\u2019 \u2014 and revolution, after all, means turning things upside down as the politico-economic criticism which is fashionable at this moment... \n\n&gt;...There is always a new tyrant waiting to take over from the old \u2014 generally not quite so bad, but still a tyrant. Consequently two viewpoints are always tenable. The one, how can you improve human nature until you have changed the system? The other, what is the use of changing the system before you have improved human nature? They appeal to different individuals, and they probably show a tendency to alternate in point of time. \n\n&gt;The moralist and the revolutionary are constantly undermining one another... the central problem \u2014 how to prevent power from being abused \u2014 remains unsolved. Dickens, who had not the vision to see that private property is an obstructive nuisance, had the vision to see that. \u2018If men would behave decently the world would be decent\u2019 is not such a platitude as it sounds.\n\nIt has to be remembered that Orwell was a full on socialist, but he was as different from \"the Socialists\" as is, to use capitalist examples, Bill Gates from Jeff Bezos. The architects of the English NHS were socialists from a Labour Party and were massively different to the Central Committee of the USSR. This is why \"they're not real socialists\" or \"they're not real libertarians\" gets bandied about.\n\nThe main difference is that some people, no matter their ideology, are just *assholes*. \n\nWho's not familiar with some SJW claiming that the word \"history\" is inherently gendered and therefore misogynistic? They're also politically aligned with the lawyers who push and fight for first amendment rights - that is, they're liberals. What about your neighbour who's a bit old fashioned and devout but would never hurt or inconvenience anybody vs Ted Cruz - conservatives. \n\nOrwell is making an important point. Ideology isn't the solution. *Not being an asshole* is the solution. People are able to move society forward and improve life for everybody when they're not being assholes to each other, separate to ideology. Shitposting memes and denouncing each other seems at best counter productive and at worst simply indulging in a person's darker fantasies.\n\nEdit: Can I add that liberalism \/ libertarianism best encapsulates \"don't be an asshole\" via the NAP","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"A deeper appreciation of George Orwell"}

It's a very interesting anomaly, because let's face it every single leftist agenda increases government tyranny. What was the last law that your leftist politicians and lobby groups advocated for that increased liberty in society? That's right, none.\n\nIn fact we know from enormous historical evidence that the left is pro-tyranny. Every single leftist dictatorship had a massive surveillance\/informant network where people had no privacy. They had no private property, and were also enslaved in labor camps, so privacy was the least of concerns.\n\nEast Germany had the biggest spying apparatus, it was a Marxist-Leninist Socialist Republic. So we expect the same leftist to be suddenly pro-human rights and pro-privacy? Of course not it's all a deception.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# The Reason:\n\nThe reason why the left supports privacy is very simple yet nobody has talked about it before. The reason is that the left wants to maintain the myth of equality. They don't want objects and events to be detailed and identifiable, otherwise it would quickly prove that egalitarianism is a myth. So to maintain this myth, they want to make everything cloudy, blurry, ambiguous in society so that nobody knows the differences and maintain the egalitarian myth.\n\nIn fact the left is concentrated specifically on `corporate surveillance` and `individual tailoring marketing` and `market research`, and most of the time completely ignores government surveillance. They have even named it, they call it `\"surveillance capitalism\"`.\n\nSo they just tag along in my opinion and a little bit they speak out about governments a little just o maintain their reputation, but in reality they don't care. They didn't cared in East Germany, what makes you think they will care if they get into power again? They just want to destroy Capitalism.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# What is Privacy?\n\nNow this might be confusing so you first have to define what is privacy really to avoid falling into the trap of the virtue signallers on the left.\n\nPrivacy for me is the exclusive right over your private property, this of course includes not being bugged inside your house, which is an assault on your property, because it steals private information from you.\n\nPrivacy can't exist without private property, it's 2 sides of the same coin, the left pretending that they care about privacy is just a charade that they are putting up in order to disrupt the market.\n\nSo I do care about privacy, but only inside my property, if I go out, I have no expectation of privacy, and why should I? Here is where the left goes crazy.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Is Corporate Tracking\/Research Bad?\n\nAs I said, I have to reiterate myself so that leftists won't make a mocking post on one of the leftist subs from where I am banned so can't respond.\n\nCorporate tracking is only bad if it violates your private property, therefore: smartphone surveillance, smart speakers, smart TV microphone listening, etc... Those are obviously bad and I don't condone those, I think they should be opposed, rightly so.\n\nBut you have to realize that about 50% of what corporations do in marketing is nothing as invasive as that, in fact it doesn't violate your private property at all, but the left is still pissing on this, and this is where their evil side comes in, because their ultimate goal is to destroy and disrupt markets.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEX: Johny wants to setup a paint shop. So he goes around all the suburbs in the area, taking a photo of everyone's house, then feeds all those photos into a Machine Learning AI, to determine which are the most popular 5 colors of the `outside walls` of the houses. So he does that, and comes up with say: #f9f4f4 , #fffbba , #baf9ff , #ffb6cc , #e8ffb6. The AI can easily get this information from the photos he took. Obviously he only photographed the outside of the houses, it's not like he breaks into every house and looks at the inner walls too. So based on this limited info, he can setup his paint shop, and sell only these paint colors, and that would give him a nice edge over his competitors. Was privacy violated here? Of course not, all of the info is public, it just needs to be processed by an AI. But the left want's to restrict even this kind of activity. How will they enforce this? With government surveillance of businesses of course.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Open Source Intelligence\n\nSo is OSI really that bad? There is tons of public data out there already, so nobody's privacy is violated, since they are not stealing private information from you. They are just processing public data. The left doesn't even want this. And to enforce a ban on this, you actually have to increase government surveillance, to enforce these laws.\n\nSo the example above is a good example. Most of the tracking corporations do is like this. They just do some market research to find out their demand and then tailor the product based on that info.\n\nAgain if they use invasive shit like spying on your through your webcam and microphone which Facebook does, then that is bad. But most businesses are not engaged in this type of behavior.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Leftist \"Solutions\"\n\nOkay now given all of this, just take a look how the left is handling the situation. In fact they aren't even handling it, they just totally change the subject from government surveillance to \"surveillance capitalism\", so now they want to restrict harmless OSI instead of focusing on the behemoth.\n\nRestricting OSI is actually censorship, because it restricts your ability to process public data, which is tyrannical.\n\nSo you can't investigate anything, and it harms usually conspiracy researchers, which is a clear agenda that they don't want people to investigate things.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Now take a look at this monstruous GDPR.**\n\n\n\nEvery leftist was praising the GDPR, they said that now privacy is really protected in the EU. Fuck, the first thing they did was exempted the governments from it:\n\n* https:\/\/www.techdirt.com\/articles\/20180605\/22253339978\/eu-commission-violates-gdpr-claims-that-exempt-law-legal-reasons.shtml\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt; [The regulation does not purport to apply to the processing of personal data for national security activities or law enforcement of the EU; ](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/General_Data_Protection_Regulation#Scope)\n\nTherefore it's a fucking farce. I knew it all along but these dumb leftists were praising this like if it were a miracle.\n\nI have wrote about it: https:\/\/old.reddit.com\/r\/Anarcho_Capitalism\/comments\/8lz0t6\/gdpr_is_a_scam\/\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo the GDPR does absolutely nothing to protect your privacy. The **ONLY** thing it does it it destroys small businesses as they now have to comply with enormous requirements, and gives a green light to government surveillance to continue unhindered.\n\nIn fact now I have to use a fucking VPN to read US news sites.  I have already fucking tracking cookies disabled, it's very easy to do:\n\n* https:\/\/github.com\/ghacksuserjs\/ghacks-user.js\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo by installing that script in your Firefox browser, you can disable all cookie tracking instantly. The GDPR bullshit doesn't even matter.\n\nHowever now my EU IP is blocked because the US news site doesn't want to get fined, even though I am not tracked by them and wasn't before that either.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n**So which one is better:** \n\n* A law `promising` to protect your privacy while it doesn't\n* Or a technical measure that guarantees to protect your privacy \n\nIt's a hard choice.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nBut yes this is what the fucking left does with their sophistry. They have redefined now the meaning of privacy, and simultaneously want to destroy capitalism and specially small businesses, while giving you the illusion that they actually care.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe left doesn't care about privacy, because it doesn't recognize private property. You can't have one without the other. Government surveillance is the only issue, because they have the authority to do absolutely immoral things.\n\nThe only extend to which the left suppoedly \"protects\" your privacy is to disrupt the markets enough to make everyone look the same. So they certainly crack down on individual tailoring of products and services, and force you out of choice.\n\nYou can't have an individually tailored service, you must consume what everyone else does. That is the juice of it.\n\nAre web cookies really that bad? The only reason they exist is to make websites more customizable. The left wants to go back to 1997 based grayscale text websites with this attitude.\n\nWe don't have any evidence that the left was ever correct about  anything, but we know for sure that their regulations definitely decrease the qualities of our lives and our liberty.\n\n**We Anarcho-Capitalists believe in privacy, but like with any other right, it should sacrosanctly apply to your property, and it should end where your property ends. You should not claim rights over somebody else's property, which the Marxists constantly do!**\n\n","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"Leftists, Surveilllance &amp; Privacy""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Leftists, Surveilllance &amp; Privacy"}

Not to get all \"No True Libertarian,\" here, but I'd say that that is the one absolute qualifier. How you might define things like \"aggression\" or \"private property\" might differ, but we'll set those things aside for now, as much as possible.\n\nSo, believing in freedom of the individual, so long as that freedom doesn't actively infringe on the person, property, or liberty of others, how do we respond to less overt or concrete infringements on our lives?\n\nFor instance, take sound ordinances. Loud noises and late night parties do no *active* harm to others, perhaps, but they most certainly can negatively impact others. Maybe even severely, especially when they're repeated or chronic behavior. Interrupted sleep--especially when a newborn is involved--, prolonged stress leading to adverse health, detriment to property values, all of these can be direct consequences of such behavior.\n\nCurrently, most cities have sound ordinances barring loud activities between certain hours. How acceptable do you all think such things would be in a minarchist society, and to what extent? On what philosophical basis? If these things are unacceptable, do we create a slippery slope, in which eventually it can be argued that *anything* which causes undue stress can be outlawed? Who decides what's undue, and how is that decided?\n\nOn the other hand, if we allow room for such behavior, it could easily be abused to allow for actual harassment and injury to quality of life.\n\nNow, HOAs are one answer. And I suppose they're a free market sort of micro government. I've personally never been a fan of them, but perhaps that has as much to do with the sort of people who form HOAs and seek to use them to exert power over others. Certainly, if they became more common, we'd see more diversity and, hopefully, restraint in their implementation. \n\nBut is that the only free-market solution? Perhaps from an ancap perspective, I don't know.\n\nAnswers to questions like these are important when advocating for application of libertarian principles in real life, or, if nothing else, to demonstrate that our philosophy actually *has* answers, rather than only being applicable in the abstract. Better thinkers than I have certainly taken the time to examine these topics, but such things are rarely talked about here.\n\nLet's change that.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on how the NAP applies to such things? What about public profanity, extremely bright lights at night in residential areas, and other things which we'd typically consider \"disturbing the peace?\"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"[Discussion] The Right to be Left Alone?

Opposing free speech does not mean we reject the notion of debating opposing viewpoints, or that we support the practice of personal censorship. This forum rejects the notion that all speech belongs everywhere.\nII. This forum is opposed to oppressive speech. \/r\/communism gets denounciations that view this guideline as oppressive. For those who are truly concerned about eliminating oppression, why would you defend oppressive speech to eternity? If oppression is to be ended, oppression through speech cannot continue.\nIII. Oppressive speech is a part of free speech.\nIV. Communists in this forum will often reject the defense of oppressive speech as a liberal tenet. Some communists who aim to eliminate oppression do not defend the speech of the dominant classes, or the speech of racists, sexists and queerphobes. This forum supports these efforts.\nV. Communism is not liberalism, nor are they related ideologically. Liberals might come in the defense of nazi speech, communists in this forum won't.\nVI. Oppressive speech supports authority where it is undue (for example: the authority of white people over black people, of men over women). Thus, this forum rejects the liberal accusations of authoritarianism based on its stance against free speech.\nVIa. Men, White people, Heterossexual people set the oppressive normative standards of our society. Attacking such groups does not qualify as oppressive speech and is not equivalent to attacking oppressed groups. MRAs will be instantly banned.\nThus:\nVII. Patriarchal, white supremacist, cissupremacist, homophobic, or otherwise oppressive speech is not tolerated here.\nVII.a. This forum is meant to be a more friendly place for communists to participate without having to be subjected to oppressive speech. Women, people of color, queer people should feel welcome. Do your part.\nVII.b. This is not restricted to posts that are openly hateful (for example: I hate women, women are inferior, etc). For example: if there is a post about the first woman cosmonaut, and there is a poster who chose to comment solely on her hair, this poster is being offensively sexist. Try to educate yourselves and each other. The moderators will try not to be overzealous in enforcing the policy, but politely ask that you try to err against posting offensive things. This forum believes that humor, serious theoretical discussions and casual conversations can all be had without offending anyone.\nVIII. Free speech will also be used in the defense of off-topic posting, or posts that otherwise break the rules of \/r\/communism. To this the response of this forum is: if all posts can exist everywhere, what is the purpose of having several different forums?\nIX. This forum's aim towards this subject is to create a class-conscious, proletarian speech. Readers will note that speech has a class character, and that communists are against bourgeois speech. The aim of this forum is to create an environment that promotes continuous discussion that accretes theory and knowledge.\nX. Those who want to engage in bourgeois speech will not be able to do so in \/r\/communism, but they have many other forums to choose from, and can create their own forums.\nXII. Off-topic posts will be removed.\nXIII. Useful link on the topic of free speech\nXIIIa. Useful link on the topic of liberalism\n\n2. On Rules:\nI. This forum rejects attempts by posters who want to bend or change the rules to conform to their own personal expectations.\nII. This forum has rules. Posters who want forums without rules are free to post in other such forums, or create their own.\nIII. \/r\/communism rejects the notion that the existance of rules is intrinsically authoritarian. This forum's rules are meant to promote variety with regards to other forums. If all posts can exist everywhere, what is the purpose of having several different forums?\nIV. \/r\/communism does not regard reddit style upvoting\/downvoting self-moderation and rediquette as the ultimate form of moderation. For those that do, they will find other forums that conform to their expectations or create their own.\nIV.a. Do not post about someone being up\/down voted, it contributes nothing.\nV. Useful link on the topic of rediquette.\n\n3. On Sectarianism:\nI. This forum is for all Marxist communists. This includes those who identify as Marxist, Luxemburgist, Leninist, Trotskyist, Stalinist, Hoxhaist, Maoist, and probably other less common lines.\nII. Do not be sectarian.\nII.a. Denouncing key aspects of communist ideologies or communist figures themselves will be considered sectarianism.[1] (please note that denouncing is not the same as providing a historical materialist critique)\nIII. There will be no attempts to affirm that one kind of communism is or isn't \"true communism\".\nIV. Proselytizing for a particular line is against the spirit of this forum.\nV. If you are posting in this forum in order to prove that another ideology is wrong or misguided, or to denounce a historical legacy, you are doing it wrong.\nVI. Have your viewpoints rest on their own merit, rather than having to enhance them by attacking opposing viewpoints. There are several ways to present your viewpoints without having to denounce someone else's. Do so.\nVII. If you hold a certain stance that \"we can not allow ourselves to glorify (insert communist figure or regime here)\", you are going against the spirit of this forum. There will be no such moral arguments of this kind.\nVIII. Praise is not sectarian, as it doesn't require the rejection of other lines.\nIX. When critiquing ideologies that differ from yours, do not reduce them to a single flaw or historical event. Engage the theoretical tenets of these lines as held by their followers.\nIX.a. Refrain from using words such as \"brutal\" and \"monster\" and \"mass murder\" and so on when referring to past communist leaders or nations. If the actual deaths that occurred under each regime are not the topic of discussion, refrain from bringing it up every time. [2]\nX. When critiquing other ideologies, the burden of making a quality post is much greater. Have your posts be theoretically developed, utilize a marxist, historical materialist analysis. Second-guess yourself. Otherwise, refrain from critiquing other lines and present arguments for your point of view that do not depend on the rejection of other lines.\nXI. It's not what you say, it's how you say it.\nXII. Do not attempt to justify sectarianism.\nXIII. Do not use a line identity as an insult (for example: those bastards! Stalinists!)\nXIII.a. Do not call other communists \"capitalists\" or \"fascists\", avoid calling them revisionists.[3]\nXIV. Do not simply post \"this is not communism\". Either provide a well worded marxist, non sectarian critique, or refrain from posting. If you are curious as to why one or another topic relates to communism, politely ask to be educated in good faith.[4]\nXV. This forum believes that sectarianism and constant infighting between lines are detrimental for continuous discussion that accretes theory and knowledge, without the hindrance of insults, infighting and repeated accusations.\nXVI. These rules are this forum's attempt at generating a different environment. However, this forum supports communists criticizing each other and supports debate amongst communists, but it recognizes the need for a focused, productive environment. Much like a classroom, students cannot have their studies interrupted everyday by the local clown, nor should they decide to have food court food wars every day all day long for the whole of their school careers.\nXVII. This forum believes that neither the purpose nor the results of these policies are to supress dissent, but to enhance it in such a manner that communists from all lines will want to read and engage with it in good faith.\n[1]Previous policy on this issue\n[2]Useful link\n[3]Useful link\n[4]Previous policy on this issue\n\n4. On the participation of non-marxist posters:\nI. This is a Marxist forum.\nII. This forum is not anarchist*. Anarchists already have many forums and are perhaps the most sizeable radical leftist and communist community on reddit.\n*nor is it anarcho-communist, autonomist, etc.\nIII. Refrain from recommending Kropotkin, Chomsky or other anarchist authors. Those interested in anarchist reading can go ask for it in anarchist forums, and other leftist places on reddit and the rest of the internet.\nIV. Refrain from saying anarchism is also communism (everyone already knows).\nV. This forum is not for capitalists, nor does it aim to educate or convert them.\nVI. Everyone, regardless of ideology, is free to probe into marxism and develop their understanding of marxism in this forum, with legitimate levels of antagonistic questioning (This forum is all too used with the tactic of trolls of baiting discussion by pretending to have legitimate inquiries. Search for previous topics to see if your questions have been adressed and try reading at least a few of the source works for marxism).\nVII. Refrain from posting too many America-centric topics such as U.S. Elections. Ron Paul posts will get deleted\/banned.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Communists can't support their views with logic nor morality, so they make up definitions and redefine terms to justify Marxist ideology.

SITSA, or the \"Stop the Importation and Trafficking of Synthetic Analogues Act of 2017\" just passed in the House of Representatives this morning, 239-142.\n\nThis bill would create a new schedule of controlled substances called the \"A\" schedule. This would allow them to schedule \n\n1. Any \"chemical structure that is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V; and\"\n\n2. \"an actual **or predicted** stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system that is substantially similar to or greater than the stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system of a controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V;\u00a0\"\n\nThis means that they can schedule any substance they want, even ones that haven't been invented yet. Furthermore, this bill removes the oversights that are currently required to schedule a substance, and extends the length of temporary scheduling from 3 to 5 years. Here is a relevant part of the bill:\n\n&gt;The Attorney General may, by rule, issue a permanent order adding a drug or other substance to schedule A if such drug or substance satisfies the criteria for being considered a schedule A substance. Such rulemaking may be commenced simultaneously with the issuance of the temporary scheduling order issued under paragraph (1) with regard to the same substance.\n\nAs you can probably see, this is completely unconstitutional. It is a violation of the separation of powers, and would **allow the attorney general, an unelected individual, to singlehandedly decide what private citizens are allowed to consume.**\n\nFurthermore, it does nothing to actually address the problems of the opioid epidemic, and would make kratom, a substance that has helped millions get off opiates, illegal.\n\n**Please, I beg you, write to your representatives and express your outrage.

Im sure many of us would agree that DUI laws can be far too harsh and the evidence to support the effectiveness of harsher DUI laws in different US states seems to be lacking.\n\n In my state of North Dakota, for example, many officers (with the overreaching authority they\u2019re granted in my state) will often exploit an ordinary traffic stop for a blinker at night, for example, as leverage to investigate a possible driving under the influence incident despite the fact that the original stop had absolutely nothing to do with being drunk and the person in question shows no signs of being drunk. And by my original question, I mean instead of using a BAC of 0.08% alone to determine whether or not one was legally fit to drive, use 0.08 as one of several factors to determine whether one was unfit to drive based largely on the way they actually operated the vehicle (such as swerving over center line, rolling stop signs, or other traffic violations that legitimately endanger other drivers). As a result, 0.08 alone wouldn\u2019t be enough to charge someone with a DUI.\n\n Yes, I do understand that this approach is less objective. But the intent of this approach would be to prevent non-dangerous drivers from feeling the wrath of harsh DUI laws and to prevent police officers from exploiting nonthreatening traffic violations (such as expired tabs) as a means to charge someone with a DUI, despite the fact that the individual was clearly capable of driving without endangering others.

{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1529126581,"num_comments":37,"score":0,"selftext":"So I was doing some thinking about libertarianism (specifically what it really is), and as I was thinking it struck me that big government and libertarianism (while traditionally they go hand in hand) are maybe not inextricable from each other in theory. I'm interested in getting some thoughts from some libertarians.\n\nIn my view, libertarianism is fundamentally a social philosophy (i.e. a school of thought regarding what the purpose of society should be) that views the primary purpose of society to maximize individual choice. If libertarianism fundamentally is more than that, then what follows won't make sense, but if you're with me so far let's keep going. \n\nTraditionally, it seems to me, libertarians have espoused small government and free market economics as the optimal way to achieve the stated aim of maximizing individual choice. I wouldn't argue that in practice this has not generally worked, but I don't necessarily see small government and free market economics as being necessary conditions for a society to be libertarian.\n\nHypothetically, if you had a society which had a stated aim of maximizing individual choice, in which the state is large and owned everything and provided a choice of available goods and services that they can consume, in exchange for contributions to the state (where each individual is apportioned a certain amount of consumption based on the value of their contribution), leaving the choice of how they want to live their life and contribute (i.e. career) up to the individual, would this not still be libertarian in the sense that there is individual choice throughout the process? \n\nIt's hard to imagine a society like this could ever exist, but assume for a second it did. In this hypothetical society the individual is free to choose how they want to live their life, what work they want to do, and is free to choose to consume certain goods and services based on what is apportioned to them. It might be the case that the individual chooses a career path that is not favoured by the state and is therefore limited in their choice of what they can consume, but this is no different than how a free market, capitalist society works. \n\nWhat do you think?\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"What do you think about the idea of big government libertarianism?"}

Looked up the wikipedia definitions for a bunch of different schools of thought, picked the one that most closely resembled mine, and my core beliefs haven't really changed since then. Identified this way all through college, have given (probably incorrect) speeches on this, and never really considered that I might be something else. \n\nLong story short I've had a few discussions recently both online and in real life leading to my removal from several socialist groups (the IRL one voluntarily) as it's been brought to my attention that what I believe isn't anarchist, it isn't socialist, and most closely matches libertarian beliefs. Personally I don't think this is correct but I have no idea where on the political spectrum my beliefs actually fall. \n\nBasically, everyone should be able to do whatever they want on their own property so long as it doesn't physically hurt another human being (or animal, within reason, hunting is fine). A fetus is not a human being until it takes its first breath. Religion is fine but your religious rights and ability to enact religious rules end at the end of your own property. The flip side of this is that your business is also your property and if you don't want to, say, make a cake for someone who doesn't agree with your religion as part of a business contract, you don't have to. \n\nThe bill of rights is the closest thing to an ideal society we have. Free speech is king (no yelling 'fire' but anything else goes), freedom of the press is right up there with speech, freedom to marry whoever you want, freedom to own as many guns as you want without regulation, freedom to drink, smoke, do anything you want to your own body. One should be able to kill oneself following a mental evaluation to prove one is of sound mind. One should be able to drive any vehicle or live in any structure that is proven not to be an immediate danger oneself or to those nearby. \n\nThe healthcare system proposed by Bernie Sanders is my only actual socialist belief (I think?) and in general I think it's a good idea. In any civilized society people should be able to go to the doctor and not worry about a six figure bill.\n\nHigher education should only be covered by the government if the person receiving the money has contributed a significant amount of effort to society (i.e. military service, and I believe people who have put in a certain amount of time to a 'dead' industry should receive training credits to put toward working in a new industry). Otherwise it's your own choice and people should individually pay for things they choose. \n\nChild labor should be illegal but the legal age of child\/adult should be between 14-16 depending on state law. State law should always outweigh federal law, and the federal government should not be able to create new laws unless something extreme happens, like a civil war. Education should be mandatory under age 14 and should prepare one to be self-sufficient, after that the individual can decide whether or not they'd like to stay in school. \n\nThe concept of taxation should be based on one's choices in life, paying for goods and services, and luxury items. If one lives a minimalist life with one small home off the grid then realistically they may not pay any taxes. Once you start buying second homes and living for fun rather than for need, more will be taxed, but your income and primary home will not be taxed. \n\nThere's more to it but this is turning into a novel. What does this sound like?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I was recently removed from a couple socialist groups both online and IRL for 'being a libertarian'.

This subset of libertarians is especially susceptible to to seeking out and being influenced by the works of Hans Hermann Hoppe, who holds the viewpoint that the NAP allows for property owners to establish private communities in which minorities and political dissenters are \u201cphysically removed\u201d.

{"author":"SuperCharged2000","created_utc":1529504458,"num_comments":27,"score":0,"selftext":"Lots of misinformation out there on this one..\n\nOver the weekend, the media went insane over the supposed Trump administration policy of separating illegal immigrant parents from their children. According to the media, Trump could with one quick fix simply prevent the separation of children from their parents; according to the media, all Trump has to do is wave his magic wand, and all will be well.\n\n**This is a lie.**\n\nMore specifically, it\u2019s several lies.\n\n**Lie 1. Trump Created Separation Of Children From Illegal Immigrant Parents.** \n-This is plainly false. In 1997, the federal government made an agreement in a case called Flores not to keep unaccompanied illegal immigrant children in custody beyond twenty days. The settlement said nothing about accompanied illegal immigrant children \u2013 children who crossed the border with their parents. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals then ruled that accompanied children also could not be held in custody under the terms of the settlement. This meant that the government either had to release whole families, or that the government had to separate parents from children.\n\n**Lie 2. Immigrants Seeking Asylum Are Being Punished For Seeking Asylum.**\n-This is plainly untrue as well. Immigrants who come to points of entry to seek asylum aren\u2019t actually illegally in the country \u2013 they\u2019re not arrested. They\u2019re processed through ICE, and their children stay with them. If, however, illegal immigrants cross the border illegally, the Trump administration now treats them as criminals. If they choose deportation, they aren\u2019t separated from their kids; if they choose to apply for asylum, they stay in the country longer than 20 days, and their kids have to be removed by operation of law.\n\n**Lie 3. The Trump Facilities Are Awful Thanks To Trump.**\n-They may be awful, but they were just as awful under President Obama. These are pictures from Brandon Darby of Breitbart circa 2014:\nhttps:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/Df7rk1pVQAENwXX?format=jpg&amp;name=small\n\nhttps:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/Df7rwMXVAAESMpQ?format=jpg&amp;name=small\n\nhttps:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/media\/Df7sKVrVMAEqOXZ?format=jpg&amp;name=small\n\nThe big mistake made by the Trump administration here came courtesy of Stephen Miller and John Kelly, both of whom reportedly stated that the administration was separating kids from parents as a sort of deterrent. That\u2019s idiotic. **The deterrent is arrest and deportation, not separating children from parents. That\u2019s why the House is attempting to pass some sort of fix here to keep kids with their parents.**\n\nBut with that said, the media coverage of this issue has been patently irresponsible. **Trump isn\u2019t forcing children away from parents. He\u2019s enforcing the law on the books. The legislature can fix that law at any time. The facilities he\u2019s using are the same facilities Obama used.** Pretending that this is Japanese internment (as Laura Bush suggested) or the Holocaust (as General Michael Hayden suggested) is ridiculous. \n\n**This policy ought to be fixed. But lying about it isn\u2019t designed to fix it.**\n\n**It\u2019s designed to prevent a fix by allowing Democrats to play political football with children, believing they\u2019re winning a victory by holding Trump\u2019s feet to the fire with pictures of crying children.**\n\nhttps:\/\/www.dailywire.com\/news\/31979\/media-are-lying-about-trump-separating-illegal-ben-shapiro","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The Truth About Trump 'Separating Families'"}

Of particular interest to the reddit community are their expertise on civil forfeiture, free speech, search and seizure, and licensing requirements.

At 20 \u00b0C and 1ATM dry air has a density of 1.14549 kg\/m3. However as a solid its density is 2353.23 \/ 1.14549 -&gt; 2054.344 times as large. ie. for a given volume of air at 20'C CO2 occupies 0.0385% \/ 2054.344 -&gt; 0.000018741% of the space. IE. for every 1m3 of space CO2 occupies just 187.41 mm3 - 187 cubic millimeters - a box 5.7mm x 5.7mm x 5.7mm. ie. \n\n**For Perspective --A box of air the size of a 1L carton of milk would have CO2 occupying the space of a sewing pin head. They claim this is the 'driver' of all climate**\n\nThis amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is the net amount - ie. the result of the production of CO2 (animals expiring CO2, volcanoes, motor vehicle exhausts, power generation etc.) minus the take up of CO2 (plants). Both these figures being much larger than the amount that remains in the atmosphere.\n\nNow the atmosphere varies in density the further away from the Earth's surface. However if we assume that the density is constant and then calculate the height required for a full planar coverage of CO2 that would correspond to the CO2 occupying 1m3 in a vertical column with a 1m2 base. CO2 occupies 0.00000018741 of 1m3 therefore 1m3 of CO2 occupies 1\/0.00000018741 -&gt; 5335894.563 m3 of atmosphere. \n\n**In other words for a 100% area coverage a column at 1ATM that is 5335Km high is required. This is far higher than the atmosphere which extends to a height of just 1% of that... ie. the radiation incident on the atmosphere from the sun will only strike a CO2 molecule 1% of the time.** This assumes that it is going straight past the N2 and O2 molecules.\n\nCO2 is not some magic molecule. It is just like other atoms and molecules. Each has its own effects. **Just because CO2 is present it doesn't mean that nitrogen and oxygen don't have any effect** - they do and they have to be put into the equation along with the other trace gasses and along with water moisture. Water moisture occupies typically 0 to 4% of the atmosphere and is primarily an insulator.\n\nThe greenhouse principle works on the following bases :-\n\n1) **Refraction of waves** (infra red radiation from the sun) thus bending them to trap them below a surface. This is how the glass in a greenhouse works.\n\n2) **Absorption and re-radiation** (eg. at different wavelengths and in different directions). This is how primarily the atmosphere works.\n\nBearing in mind that less than 1% of the plane of the atmosphere presented to the sun is going to have CO2 that is a very small effect produced by the CO2. **It's like having a stone that is composed of 1% diamond and 99% glass - the diamond isn't going to have any noticeable effect.**\nElement \tSymbol \t% by volume\nNitrogen \tN2 \t78.084\nOxygen \tO2 \t20.946\nArgon \tAr \t0.9340\nCarbon dioxide \tCO2 \t0.0397\nNeon \tNe \t0.001818\nHelium \tHe \t0.000524\nMethane \tCH4 \t0.000179\n\n#CO2 Water Solubility\n\nCO2 is soluble in water inversely proportional to temperature. **This means that the lower the temperature the more CO2 can be stored.** The lower from the surface the position in the water the lower its temperature - ie. more CO2 is stored at greater the depth.\n\nThe Earth goes through periods of cold and warm temperatures. We have had ages where the Earth has been a lush warm tropical paradise. And we have had ice ages. During the warm periods the plants produced take up masses of CO2 and use the carbon and give off the oxygen which the animals breathe. During the ice ages the plants die off and drop to the depths of the oceans. They rot and expell their carbon \\ CO2 into the water where it remains at depth. When the Earth enters another warm period (as we are currently in) the rising temperature of the atmosphere heats up the water. However it takes a long period of time for the lower depths to warm up (800 to 2000 years typically). When these lower thermoclines heat up they release their CO2 and this rises to the surface and increases the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Much of this is taken up by land based vegetation and by upper level ocean plants - sea weeds, plankton etc. .\n\n#Measurement Accuracy\n\nWhen measuring the temperature the equipment undertaking the measurement must be calibrated, the error margin must be determined and it must be used in the calculations. If the equipment is measuring to a resolution of 0.01'C but only has a accuracy of 0.1'C then the resolution is wiped out by the error margin and working at that level becomes unreliable and meaningless. A simple example of accuracy are mercury based thermometers. These are based on a column of mercury expanding with increasing temperature thus rising in height within the glass tube. However it assumes that the diameter of the internal portion of the tube is accurately known and is constant all the way up - this is where the inaccuracy is introduced and it has to be determined and included in any calculations using the resulting temperature data.\n\nA thermocouple might provide a high degree of resolution and stability but the readings have to be converted to usable signals. This is done via Analogue to Digital converters which can introduce inaccuracies via a number of sources - such as the electronics used for the conversion and for the determination of the reference voltage and the resolution used. As such the accuracy of the whole system has to be determined. When a temperature measuring station is calibrated its accuracy is also determined by the accuracy of the calibration source - ie. further inaccuracy can be introduced.\n\nAn easy way to illustrate inaccuracy is to place 4 identical temperature measuring stations in close proximity in an open field and to monitor their outputs automatically on a regular basis (eg. every 10 minutes) and then to compare them. Placing additional identical temperature measuring stations in other parts of the field and placing other different temperature measuring stations in the field will augment the results.\n\n#Modeling\n\n**Models are not reality. They are a perceived understanding of reality.** \n\nThey can be used as tools to understand and predict reality. However they have to be tested and proven. Models have an inherent accuracy and associated reliability and this has to be determined. Just because a model says something doesn't mean that it is necessarily true. Models can only be used in an indicative manner - they cannot be used as proof (after all they were constructed by us fallible humans - not by nature).\n\n#The Scientific Method\n\nThe Scientific Method is basically a chain of evidence from the initial proposing of the fundamental hypotheses, through the design of laboratory experiments to directly test these, through to the analysis and publication of the results. This has to be a step by step process - everything directly connected - ie. not making jumps - otherwise the great danger is making connections that are not there and jumping to wrong conclusions.\n\nPeer review is fundamental to the Scientific Method as it allows mistakes to be spotted and corrected. Reducing the locus might produce a desired result but it reduces the validity. **The only proof ultimately is in what happens physically - this is why reproducibility is so important.**\n\nThe most vital element is honesty and integrity. Unless the science is pursued in a rugged and honest manner it can't be relied on.\n\n#Summary\n\n**Carbon is a fundamental part of life. It is fundamental to plant and animal life. It is a fundamental atom in organic molecules. The more CO2 there is the more plants that can grow and the more food that can be produced to feed our increasing world population.**\n\nThe amount of carbon going into the atmosphere and coming out of it is far larger than the net amount in the atmosphere. Small variations of this net amount will not have any significant effect on the Earth. The Earth has a number of equilibrium maintaining mechanisms for regulating temperature and carbon concentrations. We can easily survive with higher CO2 concentrations and higher temperatures - Earth has done this in the past.\n\n#\"The level of CO2 in the atmosphere is a result of the temperature, not a cause of it.\"\n\nThe climate changes naturally - there are short term and long term cycles. We have ice ages, inter-glacial warm ages, warm periods (eg. Medieval Warm Period) and cold periods (eg. Little Ice Age). We have El Nino &amp; La Nina. These are all caused naturally. \n\n**The major source of energy that we have is the sun - it's the elephant in the room - almost all energy comes from it. Solar activity determines our temperatures, our weather and our climate.**\n\nThe tilt and rotation of the Earth and its distance from the sun certainly effect the weather and climate but these are largely constant. Our position in the galaxy also has an effect but this is much more minor.\n\nDuring the Medieval Warm Period temperatures were much warmer and all due to natural variation. Grape vines were grown in northern lattitudes (where they won't grow in current conditions). And we produced a lot of wealth as a result of the climate conditions.\n\nWe warmed out of the Little Ice Age up to the turn of the last century. The temperature has remained roughly stable since then. However indications in low population areas indicate a small amount of cooling. These have been offset by large amounts of urban heat islands in the Northern Hemisphere thus producing flat temperatures.\n\nIs the climate changing? - yes, of course it is. But it is changing naturally - as it always has and as it always will do. Does human kind have a significant effect on the climate? - no - the effect is minimal and certainly not causing any catastrophic situation to occur. Nature has a far far greater effect.\n\n#The Present and The Future\n\nPrior to the Enlightenment we had the domination of feudalism. The Enlightenment produced our modern miracle world. It did this through various means including :-\n\n-The Scientific Method.\n\n-Freedom of speech.\n\n-Freedom of enquiry.\n\n-Civil society - Rule of Law.\n\n-Democratic Capitalism.\n\nHowever there has been a constant battle between feudal elements and enlightened elements in our society. Feudalism constantly re-invents itself and constantly tries to impose the old (and disastrous) ways onto the world - top down command and control, high debt, restriction of freedoms, lack of morality and moral integrity, high levels of dishonesty, high levels of corruption \\ jobs for the boys and girls - creaming off money.\n\n**Warmism is a modern version of Feudalism.** There is no scientific basis in warmism. It uses pseudo science (snake oil science). Its proponents are happy to make huge amounts of money off their useful fools whilst at the same time living completely contradicting lives. It is purely about money, power and control, nothing more. And all to the detriment of all of us and of our future. Feudalism is always highly damaging.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I am a Climate Denier --- post 4 -- \"Doing the Maths\""}

Interestingly I find nothing too lefty in it, it's not a communist manifesto by all means, and would be more or less compatible with an Ancap, perhaps Minarchist society.\n\n\n**Article 1: Innate freedom and equality**\n\nYes everyone should be free, and treated without prejudice as a stranger, but this should not mean that once you get to know the person, you can't treat him or her differently depending on personality. This means that people should not be racists and collectively accuse people, but it also doesn't mean that they should let people get away with stuff just by claiming that they are part of a minority. \n\n**Article 2: Ban on discrimination**\n\nA reiteration of above, while discriminating strangers is bad, I don't think once you get to know a person it should be an issue. But perhaps in official cases people should not be discriminated and there I agree. \n\n**Article 3: Right to life**\n\nAbsolutely, murder and death pentalty is barbaric.\n\n**Article 4: Ban on slavery**\n\nAbsolutely, and slavery should include any forms of active forced labor, where people are coerced by others to work. This includes mandatory school systems where I was literally forced as a child to clean up an entire floor as a detention, I would call that literal child slavery that I was subjected to.\n\n**Article 5: Ban on torture**\n\nAbsolutely, and it should also be extended to psychological torture. A lot of kids are psychologically tortured by their abusive parents or teachers, which needs to be stopped.\n\n**Article 6: Right to recognition as a person before the law**\n\nThis is 2 sided because it obviously makes you part of the system, but if these protections are setup well, it could work. Obviously we are talking about a minarchist society here.\n\n**Article 7: Equality before the law**\n\nSame as 2 and 1.\n\n**Article 8: Right to effective judiciary**\n\nSpeedy trials, factual judiciary, no corruption, these should be useful principles that a society could use.\n\n**Article 9: Ban on arbitrary detention**\n\nAbsolutely, in fact we should ban detention alltogether. Jails should not exist. Whereas after a person is convicted, you could put him in prison. This would apply only to violent crimes, I hope in a free society, victimless crimes are eliminated. \n\n**Article 10: Right to public hearing**\n\nSame as 8.\n\n**Article 11: Right to the presumption of innocence**\n\nThis is crucial, all these Orwellian pre-crime systems need to be stopped as they are. Thought crimes should never exist.\n\n**Article 12: Right to privacy**\n\nAbsolutely this should be sacrosanct. Privacy is perhaps the 3nd most fundamental right after property and life. Without privacy, you can't criticize  people and formulate your thoughts. There should be no compromise on privacy at all. \n\n**Article 13: Right to freedom of movement**\n\nDon't get triggered, this is not about immigration. It simply just states that you have a right to move inside the country and can leave it. Which of course countries like the Soviet Union and other Communist tyrannies, prohibited their citizens from leaving. It was an open air prison. So this simply just states that you are allowed to leave a country, it doesn't mean that other countries should be forced to take you in.\n\nOf course people should be allowed to leave, a country should not be an open air prison like NK or SU was. Holding people tax hostages after bundling up tons of welfare programs is extremely evil.\n\n**Article 14: Right to asylum**\n\nYes so people who are under active persecution should be able to ask for asylum from other countries. It should not mean that others have to take them in. And we must be clear here, active persecution means like how the Jews were persecuted in Nazi Germany, and interestingly were denied asylum from many countries. \n\nThe current wave of migrants are not persecuted. So you don't make a right from 2 wrongs.  They just come here for the benefits, in fact are actively used as voter cattle to vote for left. The current wave of immigration is basically just leftist human trafficking for votes.\n\nSo yes, persecuted people should be able to ask for help, but then nobody should be forced to take in millions of welfare money seekers, that would violate your other rights.\n\n**Article 15: Right to a nationality**\n\nWell yes people are born in a state, they should be citizens there. Similarly you should be able to renounce your citizenship, which many countries prohibit.\n\n**Article 16: Right to marriage and family**\n\nAbsolutely, the youth should be incentivized to be moral people who raise a family and make babies.\n\nAll these young people who work in shitty jobs, are overtaxed, and don't have money to raise a family. If anything there should be no income tax for people under 30, in fact there should be no income tax.\n\n**Article 17: Right to own property**\n\nIt should be sacrosanct, this is the 2nd most important right. Without property, you are just a slave at the mercy of others. In the SU you were at the mercy of bureau rats who either gave you grain or not, in the case of Holodomor. You absolutely must have private property, this is your most important right after the right to life. Live without property is literally slavery.\n\n**Article 18: Right to freedom of thought and religion**\n\nOf course, thought policing is Orwellian.\n\n**Article 19: Right to freedom of opinion and expression**\n\nAbsolutely and this should tie into your right of privacy and anonymity. You should be able to express yourself no matter what, and in no matter what format. Stick and stones could break your bones, but words should not hurt you.\n\n**Article 20: Right to freedom of assembly and association**\n\nYes you should be able to be part of a group of your choice. And as I said, this should not conflict Article 2, because you should be able to segregate into groups of your choice, but that doesn't mean that you should discriminate against strangers ,especially not in official cases. So it's not a contradiction in my view.\n \n**Article 21: Right to take part in government**\n\nThis means applies to a minarchist society. In an ancap society maybe there would be some sort of council of property owners, so you should be able to participate in those discussions.\n\n**Article 22: Right to social security**\n\nAbsolutely, old people should have enough savings or a private pension plan to live in their old age.This should not mean that the govenment should setup a monopolized ponzi scheme and tax young people to provide for old ones.\n\nThe current vampiric ponzi scheme is unsustainable, and should be replaced immediately with a sustainable segregated account private pension system or the one of the choice of each individual.\n\n**Article 23: Right to work**\n\nYes everyone should be able to work. This mean that minimum wages must be eliminated immediately because it prohibits low skilled people from working. And disabled people should be allowed to work on easier jobs, and should not be forced on welfare.\n\nPeople want to do something with their lives so, anyone should be able to work. Even children, so ban on child labor should be lifted.\n\n**Article 24: Right to rest**\n\nYes.\n\n**Article 25: Right to an adequate standard of living**\n\nThis is more like a guiding principle, not a law. And all measures should be taken by communities voluntarily. \n\nIt says that mothers should be taken care of while raising kids, well obviously that is the husband's job.\n\n**Article 26: Right to education**\n\n&gt; Elementary education shall be compulsory.\n\nNow here I have issues. No education should be compulsory, or it turns into a propaganda system.\n\nEducation should be free as in freedom.\n\n&gt; Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nYes, which ironically the current school system doesn't do. Instead it fills kids with propaganda.\n\n\n**Article 27: Right to participate in cultural life**\n\nAgain this is more like a guiding principle.\n\n**Article 28: Right to to a social and international order**\n\nBasically means no wars and leftist riots, which I agree with.\n\n**Article 29: Duties and limitations**\n\n&gt; Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible. \n\nYes every human being should work towards the betterment of humanity. Your life's purpose is to first take care of your family but also to help out humanity either via technological inventions or via your hard work or organization skills or capital investments.\n\nIt is key for humanity to survive so everyone should work towards making human life better by all definitions.\n\n&gt; In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others \n\nYes a balance is needed between your rights and those of others. But this should not turn into a \"greater good\" type of doctrine that would limit individual rights. Individual rights should be the basis point, and the limitation should only apply because of your peers, not because of the government.\n\n\n**Article 30: Salvatory clause**\n\nBasically meaning that all of the articles should apply simultaneously and should not be cherrypicked.\n\n\n------------------\n\n\nSo it looks like a pretty good framework with a few tweaks here and there, it was obviously written 70 years ago so it should be modernized to apply to current society, but the basic natural rights should be the same, as they were the same since the ancient times.\n\nIt could be a framework for a Minarchist society, or even an Ancap society, if we apply the articles to be only guiding principles instead of precise instructions.\n\nObviously the parts where it says that you should be provided SS and healchare, should not mean that the government should have a monopoly on it, otherwise every Communist country should be penalized for having such a shitty healthcare system.\n\nYour rights should still exist, but they should be served by the free market in my view.\n\nWhat's your take on it?\n\n","subreddit":"Anarcho_Capitalism","title":"Universal Declaration of Human Rights""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Universal Declaration of Human Rights"}

Let's dig deeper...We'll look at 2014 which was widely hailed as the 'warmest year on record'.\n\n\n\n**What Is The Average Global Temperature? ---** \n\nThis is a much more complex question that one might believe. It is not as easy as looking at some tree rings (that only tells what the temperature is where the tree grew) or even combining measuring stations (you can't have measuring stations all over the planet, so you have to fill in the blanks somehow)... but strangely these assertions of 'warmest year ever' nearly always fail to mention what data that profound announcement was based on. \n\nNo all measurement are not equal. This is the best breakdown of this question I have found, highly recommended viewing. \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eL-HyviLy6c&amp;feature=youtu.be\n\nGlobal temperature datasets \u2013 overview -- http:\/\/climate4you.com\/GlobalTemperatures.htm#Recent%20global%20air%20temperature%20change,%20an%20overview\n\nSuzuki: What\u2019s a dataset? -- https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zOK8JhgwmZ8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=143\n\nRSS upper air temperature data -- http:\/\/www.remss.com\/measurements\/upper-air-temperature\n\nRSS Global Mean Temperature trend analysis Feb 1997 \u2013 Oct 2015 -- http:\/\/blog.heartland.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/monckton-graph-18-years-no-global-warming.png\n\nNow that last one is important. How, you may ask yourself, can you get the \"Warmest year on record\" when the data clearly shows there has been no warming? Glad you asked...\n\nNASA's Own Data Refutes 2014 \"Warmest on Record\" Claim --http:\/\/www.thenewamerican.com\/tech\/environment\/item\/19930-nasa-s-own-data-refutes-2014-warmest-on-record-claim **\"Despite actually boasting of its satellites monitoring \u201cEarth\u2019s vital signs\u201d in the announcement, NASA opted to highlight its dubious temperature \u201cestimates\u201d rather than the objective, unmanipulated, comprehensive global data collected by its own expensive taxpayer-funded technology.\"**\n\n\"...after being pressed by increasingly skeptical journalists on its data, NASA scientists claimed to be only 38 percent sure that last year was actually the warmest on record. The press release declaring 2014 to be the \u201cwarmest on record\u201d failed to mention that fact, however. When asked by the U.K. Daily Mail whether the NASA scientists behind the data regretted not mentioning the crucial fact that the margin of error was greater than the alleged temperature difference between other years and 2014, they reportedly stopped responding to questions.\"\n\nfrom u\/NosuchRedditor \n\nThe ability for the propagandists behind AGW to disconnect any measurable impact of warming from the claims is astounding.\n\nIn 2003 there was a heatwave in Europe and thousands died from it. Where are the heat related deaths? We humans have seen this before, and we are fortunate to have conquered the weather with climate controlled buildings, making much of the heat and cold related deaths a thing of the past but in some places on the planet the temps are so moderate in the summer that most homes and buildings don't have the kind of climate controls needed to cope with unusual heat. So when a real heatwave happens there are deaths and crop failures that accompany it.\n\nNo heat deaths and no crop failures and no other measurable impact equals propaganda.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I am a Climate Denier --- post 5 --- \"Warmest Year On Record\""}

Welcome to our #SexWorkAMA!** \n\nI\u2019m [Liara Roux](http:\/\/aboutliara.com). You may know me - my selfies have ended up on the front page a few times over the years! And you may be familiar with the discussion in the comments under them - many people have been surprised to find out [I\u2019m a sex worker](https:\/\/motherboard.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/mbkv7a\/coming-out-as-a-sex-worker-liara-roux-personal-essay) and curious about what that means. \n\nFans on here have asked for an AMA about my work - and seems now\u2019s the time! I didn\u2019t want to just talk about my personal experiences though. [Our community](https:\/\/motherboard.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/wjbkp9\/desiree-conference-canceled-fosta-sesta-sex) has been devastated in the wake of a string of [terrible government policies and laws](https:\/\/motherboard.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/bjpqvz\/fosta-sesta-sex-work-and-trafficking). We already were banned from a lot of internet platforms and it\u2019s been getting worse - we\u2019ve tracked over 150 sites and services that don\u2019t allow sex workers, from PayPal to Skype or even AirBnB, in [a massive 90 page report](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1c1nqawo1QuiVlpA3bhS8xyDxzDDlRq6BoogAoc91OmU\/edit). We\u2019re worried [another upcoming \u201ctrafficking\u201d bill](https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/entry\/human-trafficking-banking-bill-sex-workers_us_5b045577e4b0740c25e5efd1) will result in many sex workers losing their bank accounts - and that\u2019s not a fantastical worry; many people including myself have lost bank accounts in the past for being sex workers, regardless of the legality of their specific work.\n\nSince stigma about our work and state violence against sex workers keeps many in the closet, it\u2019s easy for prohibitionist organizations, law enforcement, and politicians to make up stories about our lives. Many cite all advertisements for sex work online as \u201cinstances of trafficking\u201d or \u201csexual exploitation.\u201d But our real lives are complicated and varied. \n\nSome of us do work that\u2019s criminalized, some don\u2019t. Some work in person, others make content for stores or work online or on a phone. Some of us work for day to day survival, or have worked under coercion or force, many of us work happily and safely for ourselves. People may be both a victim of prior abuse and now a consensual sex worker. Some of us are lucky to support ourselves, others work hard to support their families. We\u2019re homeless and own homes. We\u2019re working class and famous libertines - or sometimes one branded as the other to the public. What you see of us in public is never the whole story.\n\n\nWe\u2019re coming together as a broader community to push for respect as workers and human beings, and fight for better working conditions and access to the same basic tools and government resources as everyone else. Not everyone loves sex work, but you don\u2019t need to think something is \u201cempowering\u201d to want it to be safer. You don\u2019t even need to respect their work to believe they deserve human rights.\n\nThere are many ways to be a sex worker, and there are also important topics to discuss with regards to safety and abuse in the industry. There are valuable lessons to learn from other countries - many people work in places where full service, in person sex work is legal or decriminalized. There are a lot of people in this fight - and it\u2019s global. Today I\u2019ve brought with me some other experts - and put out the invite on social media for more sex workers to join in!\n\nThis event had an open call. We\u2019re not handpicking or gatekeeping, just checking to make sure people are who they say they are. Everyone\u2019s experiences and words are their own.

For example, you\u2019ve heard a lot about sex trafficking, something we all work hard to combat - we know how hard the job can be and no one should be forced into it! But a lot of myths and misconceptions about our industry end up hurting us *and* trafficking victims - we all know people who have been hurt or are no longer with us. It\u2019s also possible for someone to be a survivor of abuse *and* a current sex worker - maybe one who loves their job, maybe one who hates it! But many of the loudest voices in the fight against trafficking are actually faith based organizations who believe the only way to help improve working conditions is to \u201crescue\u201d sex workers through arrest.\n\nRecently Congress passed a law titled (in the House and Senate) the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act and Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act. It sounds great on the surface - no one wants to stop sex trafficking more than sex workers - but the laws don\u2019t actually do anything for trafficking victims at all! There\u2019s no additional funding, no direct aid, no new studies, no task forces, not even more money for law enforcement - the only thing the law does is create additional crimes to do with websites \u201cfacilitating prostitution.\u201d The [actual text of \u00a7 2421A](https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/115th-congress\/house-bill\/1865\/text) mentions \u201cprostitution\u201d 5 times and coercion or force (until now needed to define something as trafficking) zero times.

Is there any kind of seeing this as a good outcome since there's now another business doing its economics thang even though the government got involved to do it?\n\nSo here are the thoughts that are running through my head. Libertarianism is okay with there still being a state, just a minimal one. But that's because more power leads to more aggression, which leads to more power. Libertarianism also hates taxes, but sees it as a necessary evil for \"necessary\" institutions (fire dept, hospitals, roads, military, things that you're willing to pay for so that you don't have to do it yourself like going to Supercuts instead of cutting your own hair in a mirror). And then whenever there's a debate about legalizing marijuana, the two major arguments I hear are \"why not\" and (more relevant) \"it's good because it will bring in tax revenue,\" so it sounds like Libertarianism is okay with capitalism mixing with taxes for raising revenue...?\n\nSo what happens if the hypothetically Libertarian state (which has much lower taxes and much fewer things to pay for) pays for all the roads and necessary institutions and has a tax surplus? Is it free reign? Does business being its designation make any difference? Is it crony capitalism? \n\nI guess I'm just trying to figure out where exactly the powers stop? I suppose it may go back to the fundamental question of \"well, what is the purpose of government?\" and that's that. But I thought I'd hear some other opinions on it.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Libertarianism On Chambers of Commerce?"}

From relative obscurity just a few decades ago it has spawned thousands of organisations and claims millions of committed activists. Reading the newspaper today it is hard to imagine a time when global warming, resource depletion, environmental catastrophes and 'saving the planet' were barely mentioned. They now rank among the top priorities on the social, political and economic global agenda.\n\nEnvironmental awareness is considered to be the mark of any good honest decent citizen. Multi-national companies compete fiercely to promote their environmental credentials and 'out-green' each other. The threat of impending ecological disasters is uniting the world through a plethora of international treaties and conventions. But where did this phenomenon come from, how did it rise to such prominence, and more importantly, where is it going?\n\nWhile researching for these articles, and during my academic studies, I have come across many references to the The Club of Rome (CoR), and reports produced by them. Initially I assumed that they were just another high-level environmental think-tank and dismissed the conspiracy theories found on many websites claiming that the CoR is a group of global elitists attempting to impose some kind of one world government.\n\nI am not a conspiratorial person by nature and was faced with a dilemma when I first read their reports. But it's all there - in black and white. The CoR claims that \"we are facing an imminent catastrophic ecological collapse\" and \"our only hope is to transform humanity into a global interdependent sustainable society, based on respect and reverence for the Earth.\" In the end I came to the conclusion that there are two possibilities \u2013 either the CoR wrote all these reports and setup a vast network of supporting organisations just for fun or they actually believe what they have written and are working hard to fulfill their role as the self-appointed saviors of Gaia.\n\nMany years ago H.L. Mencken warned us of this technique. Of course not referring to current day climate hysteria, he know how the elites attempt to control the populous.\n\n**\"The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed \u2014 and hence clamorous to be led to safety \u2014 by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.\"**\n\n**\"The urge to save humanity is almost always only a false face for the urge to rule it.\"**\n-H.L. Mencken:\n\nBased on my close observation of their actions, and watching the recommendations made by the CoR many years ago now being adopted as official UN and government po\n\n#So, what exactly is the Club of Rome and who are its members?\n\nFounded in 1968 at David Rockefeller\u2019s estate in Bellagio, Italy, the CoR describes itself as \"a group of world citizens, sharing a common concern for the future of humanity.\" It consists of current and former Heads of State, UN beaureacrats, high-level politicians and government officials, diplomats, scientists, economists, and business leaders from around the globe.\n\nThe Club of Rome subsequently founded two sibling organizations, the Club of Budapest and the Club of Madrid. The former is focused on social and cultural aspects of their agenda, while the latter concentrates on the political aspects. All three of these 'Clubs' share many common members and hold joint meetings and conferences. As explained in other articles on this website it is abundantly clear that these are three heads of the same beast. The CoR has also established a network of 33 National Associations. Membership of the 'main Club' is limited to 100 individuals at any one time. Some members, like Al Gore and Maurice Strong, are affiliated through their respective National Associations (e.g. USACOR, CACOR etc).\n\nhttp:\/\/www.green-agenda.com\/globalrevolution.html\n\nDr Tim Ball details how the science of climate change came to be \u201ctortured until it fitted in with [the] notion\u201d :\n\n**Almost every aspect of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) work is manipulated, selected, and controlled, to prove human CO2 is causing global warming.

That climate changes? That we have some impact? That we have a large impact? That we have a catastrophically large impact? That we have such a catastrophic impact that we shouldn't use fossil fuels?\n\nWhat you'll find is that people don't want to define what 97% agree on--because there is nothing remotely in the literature saying 97% agree we should ban most fossil fuel use.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that 97% of people making the 97% claim have absolutely no idea where that number comes from.\n\nIf you look at the literature, the specific meaning of the 97% claim is: 97 percent of climate scientists agree that there is a global warming trend and that human beings are the main cause--that is, that we are over 50% responsible. The warming is a whopping 0.8 degrees over the past 150 years, a warming that has tapered off to essentially nothing in the last decade and a half.\n\n[Image 1](https:\/\/thumbor.forbes.com\/thumbor\/960x0\/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Falexepstein%2Ffiles%2F2015%2F01%2F4warming_color2.jpg)\n\n[Image 2](https:\/\/thumbor.forbes.com\/thumbor\/960x0\/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Falexepstein%2Ffiles%2F2015%2F01%2F4warming_color2.jpg)\n \nSources: \nhttp:\/\/www.metoffice.gov.uk\/hadobs\/hadcrut4\/data\/current\/download.html\n\nhttp:\/\/scrippsco2.ucsd.edu\/data\/merged_ice_core\/merged_ice_core_yearly.csv\n\nEven if 97% of climate scientists agreed with this, and even if they were right, it in no way, shape, or form would imply that we should restrict fossil fuels--[which are crucial to the livelihood of billions.](http:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/)\n\n[Image 3](https:\/\/thumbor.forbes.com\/thumbor\/960x0\/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Falexepstein%2Ffiles%2F2015%2F01%2Fcolor-4-panel31.jpg)\n\nSources: \nhttp:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/\n\nBecause the actual 97% claim doesn\u2019t even remotely justify their policies, catastrophists like President Obama and John Kerry take what we could generously call creative liberties in repeating this claim.\n\nOn his Twitter account, President Obama tweets: \u201cNinety-seven percent of scientists agree: #climate change is real, man-made and dangerous.\u201d Funny, when Obama [flat out got it wrong on Twitter,](https:\/\/twitter.com\/BarackObama\/status\/335089477296988160) there were no paid trolls to call him out..\n\nNot only does Obama sloppily equate \u201cscientists\u201d with \u201cclimate scientists,\u201d but more importantly he added \u201cdangerous\u201d to the 97% claim, which is not there in the literature.\n\nThis is called the fallacy of equivocation: using the same term (\u201c97 percent\u201d) in two different ways to manipulate people. In other words, he made up this claim.\n\nJohn Kerry pulled the same stunt when trying to tell the underdeveloped world that it should use fewer fossil fuels:\n\nAnd let there be no doubt in anybody\u2019s mind that the science is absolutely certain. . . 97 percent of climate scientists have confirmed that climate change is happening and that human activity is responsible. . . . . they agree that, if we continue to go down the same path that we are going down today, the world as we know it will change\u2014and it will change dramatically for the worse.\nhttps:\/\/ph.usembassy.gov\/secretary-kerrys-remarks-on-climate-change\/\n\nIn Kerry\u2019s mind, 97% of climate scientists said whatever Kerry wants them to have said.\n\nBottom line: What the 97% of climate scientists allegedly agree on is very mild and in no way justifies restricting the energy that billions need.\n\nBut it gets even worse. Because it turns out that 97% didn\u2019t even say that.\n\nWhich brings us to the next question:\n\n#2.How do we know the 97% agree?\n\nTo elaborate, how was that proven?\n\nAlmost no one who refers to the 97% has any idea, but the basic way it works is that a researcher reviews a lot of scholarly papers and classifies them by how many agree with a certain position.\n\nUnfortunately, in the case of 97% of climate scientists agreeing that human beings are the main cause of warming, the researchers have engaged in egregious misconduct.\n\nOne of the main papers behind the 97 percent claim is authored by John Cook, who runs the popular website SkepticalScience.com, a virtual encyclopedia of arguments trying to defend predictions of catastrophic climate change from all challenges.\n\nHere is Cook\u2019s summary of his paper: \u201cCook et al. (2013) found that over 97 percent [of papers he surveyed] endorsed the view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause.\u201d\n\nThis is a fairly clear statement\u201497 percent of the papers surveyed endorsed the view that man-made greenhouse gases were the main cause\u2014main in common usage meaning more than 50 percent.\n\nBut even a quick scan of the paper reveals that this is not the case. Cook is able to demonstrate only that a relative handful endorse \u201cthe view that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause.\u201d Cook calls this \u201cexplicit endorsement with quantification\u201d (quantification meaning 50 percent or more). The problem is, only a small percentage of the papers fall into this category; Cook does not say what percentage, but when the study was publicly challenged by economist David Friedman, one observer calculated that only 1.6 percent explicitly stated that man-made greenhouse gases caused at least 50 percent of global warming.\n\nWhere did most of the 97 percent come from, then? Cook had created a category called \u201cexplicit endorsement without quantification\u201d\u2014that is, papers in which the author, by Cook\u2019s admission, did not say whether 1 percent or 50 percent or 100 percent of the warming was caused by man. He had also created a category called \u201cimplicit endorsement,\u201d for papers that imply (but don\u2019t say) that there is some man-made global warming and don\u2019t quantify it. In other words, he created two categories that he labeled as endorsing a view that they most certainly didn\u2019t.\n\nThe 97 percent claim is a deliberate misrepresentation designed to intimidate the public\u2014and numerous scientists whose papers were classified by Cook protested:\n\n**\u201cCook survey included 10 of my 122 eligible papers. 5\/10 were rated incorrectly. 4\/5 were rated as endorse rather than neutral.\u201d**\n\u2014Dr. Richard Tol\n\n**\u201cThat is not an accurate representation of my paper . . .\u201d**\n\u2014Dr. Craig Idso\n\n**\u201cNope . . . it is not an accurate representation.\u201d**\n\u2014Dr. Nir Shaviv\n\n**\u201cCook et al. (2013) is based on a strawman argument . . .\u201d**\n\u2014Dr. Nicola Scafetta\n\nand just to put the 'consensus' to bed once and for all...\n\n[Here](https:\/\/wattsupwiththat.com\/2018\/01\/10\/the-97-climate-consensusstarts-to-crumble-with-485-new-papers-in-2017-that-question-it\/) are 485 peer reviewed, published papers from just 2017 that questioned the so called consensus... \n\nLook, science is never done by consensus anyway. If it was we would still be adhering to the Catholic Church's insistence that the world is flat and Newton would have been burned at the stake for wrongthink.\n\nThink about how many times you hear that 97 percent or some similar figure thrown around. It\u2019s based on crude manipulation propagated by people whose ideological agenda it serves. It is a license to intimidate.\n\nIt\u2019s time to revoke that license.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I am a Climate Denier --post 7-- The Consensus"}

{"author":"xghtai737","created_utc":1529750955,"num_comments":3,"score":8,"selftext":"(Not explicitly mentioned prior to 1976.)\n\n**1976** We should return to the historic libertarian tradition of ... recognizing the right to unrestricted travel and immigration. \n\n**1978** We condemn massive roundups by the federal government of Hispanic-Americans and others in a hunt for aliens not possessing required government documents. Those suspected of being undocumented aliens are denied the fundamental freedom to labor and to move about unmolested. \n\nWe therefore call for the lifting of all restrictions on immigration and for full amnesty for currently undocumented aliens. \u2026 We support the abolition of the Border Patrol. \n\n**1980** We ... call for the elimination of all restriction on immigration, the abolition of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Border Patrol, and a declaration of full amnesty for those people who have entered the country illegally. \n\n**1984** We condemn massive roundups of Hispanic Americans and others by the federal government in its hunt for individuals not possessing required government documents. We strongly oppose all measures that would punish employers who hire undocumented workers. Such measures repress enterprise, harass workers, and systematically discourage employers from hiring Hispanics. \n\nUndocumented non-citizens should not be denied the fundamental freedom to labor and to move about unmolested. \u2026 We therefore call for the elimination of all restrictions on immigration, the abolition of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Border Patrol, and a declaration of full amnesty for all people who have entered the country illegally.\n\n(Nearly unchanged until the Portland Massacre in 2006.)\n\n**2006** The Issue: Our borders are currently neither open, closed, nor secure. This situation restricts the labor pool, encouraging employers to hire undocumented workers, while leaving those workers neither subject to nor protected by the law. A completely open border allows foreign criminals, carriers of communicable diseases, terrorists and other potential threats to enter the country unchecked. Pandering politicians guarantee access to public services for undocumented aliens, to the detriment of those who would enter to work productively, and increasing the burden on taxpayers. \n\nThe Principle: The legitimate function and obligation of government to protect the lives, rights and property of its citizens, requires awareness of and control over the entry into our country of foreign nationals who pose a threat to security, health or property. Political freedom and escape from tyranny demands that individuals not be unreasonably constrained by government in the crossing of political boundaries. Economic freedom demands the unrestricted movement of human as well as financial capital across national borders. \n\nSolutions: Borders will be secure, with free entry to those who have demonstrated compliance with certain requirements. The terms and conditions of entry into the United States must be simple and clearly spelled out. Documenting the entry of individuals must be restricted to screening for criminal background and threats to public health and national security. It is the obligation of the prospective immigrant to demonstrate compliance with these requirements. Once effective immigration policies are in place, general amnesties will no longer be necessary. \n\nTransitional Action: Ensure immigration requirements include only appropriate documentation, screening for criminal background and threats to public health and national security. Simplifying the immigration process and redeployment of surveillance technology to focus on the borders will encourage the use of regular and monitored entry points, thus preventing trespass and saving lives. End federal requirements that benefits and services be provided to those in the country illegally. Repeal all measures that punish employers for hiring undocumented workers. Repeal all immigration quotas. \n\n**2008** Political freedom and escape from tyranny demand that individuals not be unreasonably constrained by government in the crossing of political boundaries. Economic freedom demands the unrestricted movement of human as well as financial capital across national borders. However, we support control over the entry into our country of foreign nationals who pose a threat to security, health or property. \n\n(Unchanged since 2008.)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Evolution Of The Immigration Plank Of The Libertarian Party Platform"}

From minute details of the paleoclimate to the world state 200 years in the future, alarmists know everything.\n\nThe alarmist movement stubbornly refuses to debate its dogma, calling it \u201csettled science\u201d and viciously attacking its critics. The attacks are not limited to name calling but include prohibiting scientific research that contradicts this dogma. Significant figures within the movement call for criminal persecution of those who publicly disagree with the dogma and, in some cases, for those who do not follow it. Proposed punishments for \u201cheretics\u201d and \u201cinfidels\u201d include prison and even death.\n\n**It has a holy book** \u2014 The IPCC Reports\n\n-the main source of authority on all things related to climate, energy, the biological cycle, and consequentially, everything else. \n\n**It has Cult Followers** -- Individuals, organizations, and even governments that quote these unholy texts and use them to justify their decisions.\n\n**It has its own Priest Class** -- Taxpayer-funded impostor \u201cclimate scientists\u201d, having almost no real (i.e. independent of the climate alarmism) scientific achievements.\n\n-1.Frequently, they do not even have scientific degrees.\n\n-2.The alarmists sincerely believe that **only members of the priest class** are capable of understanding and seriously discussing \u201cclimate science.\u201d \n\n-An anti-alarmist Oregon Petition has been signed by more than 31,000 experts, including more than 9,000 Ph.D, but they are not sanctioned so they don't count.\n\n**It has infallible gods.** Computer Models. No matter how many times they are wrong. \n\n**It denies, ignores, or distorts elementary scientific facts**, some of which should be known even to kids:\n\n**\u2013 Photosynthesis.** Plants grow by converting atmospheric CO2 into biomass. Significant parts of the world agricultural output are due to additional CO2 fertilization\n\n\u2013**Archimedes\u2019 principle.** Melting of Arctic ice cannot increase the sea level because Arctic ice floats in water.\n\n\u2013Sunspots and the effect of solar activity changes.\n\n**It appeals to medieval science errors.** \n\n-That nature has existed forever in some unchanged state, denying, ignoring, or underestimating natural climate change; evolution (including species\u2019 disappearance and adaptation); higher CO2 levels in the geological past; natural sea level increases in the current interglacial period; tectonic movement; the complex trajectory of the Earth\u2019s motion around the Sun; and the astronomic observations of stars similar to the Sun.\n\n**It creates and spreads mythology** - commonly described as an appeal to everyday experiences, not applicable to the discussed natural processes (the \u201cFlat Earth fallacy\u201d). Some samples:\n\n\u2013 Incorrect association of CO2 with warming because of the word \u201cgreenhouse\u201d\u2014the mother of the global warming scare. Most city dwellers only know that greenhouses are warm and contain elevated levels of CO2 and easily led to believe that CO2 causes warming. Most farmers also know that CO2 is added for fertilization and does not cause greenhouse warming. This is why states with many farmers (like Oklahoma) are skeptics of the climate change cult and states with many professors (like Massachusetts) are believers.\n\n\u2013 Incorrect claim that (allegedly anthropogenic) global warming causes glacier melting or Antarctic ice sheet collapse. Ice cream does melt faster in a warmer room, but glaciers and ice sheets are influenced by totally different physical processes and on a totally different timeframe. \n\n\u2013 Incorrect claims like global warming causes droughts. Droughts are popularly associated with high temperatures but not caused by them. \n\n-False attribution of wildfires, New Orleans\u2019 devastation from Hurricane Katrina, current California water shortages, and various disasters to global warming. These disasters are caused by environmentalist politics, not by global warming. Hurricane Katrina was only Category 3 upon landfall. New Orleans was supposed to withstand all hurricanes up to the highest Category 5, but the required barriers were not built because of the resistance by environmentalists.\n\n**\u2013Time scale confusion.** Processes that take hundreds of years are described as if they happen overnight.\n\nIt has its own \u201cstart of the time\u201d\u2014usually 1880 (sometimes the 1880s), which is allegedly the beginning of instrumental temperature records.\n\n**It has its own Armageddon.** To avoid this horrible end, we have to **repent** (i.e., accept the climate change cult dogma), **stop sinning** (releasing CO2), and generously pay whomever the IPCC or UNFCC will tell us to pay **(Indulgences)**\n\n**It seeks to control governments.** Even worse, it provokes international conflicts over hot air (mythical country quotas to release carbon dioxide).\n\n**Like any good cult, it has survived multiple exposures of its frauds**\u2014something that a normal fraud cannot survive. Nevertheless, many cults involve fraud, and even true believers are not against profiting from their position in their cult. The climate change cult has been elevated by many administrations as the New State Religion. \n\nSources\n\nhttps:\/\/defyccc.com\/cult-of-climate-change\/?sc\n\nhttps:\/\/defyccc.com\/oregon-petition\/\n\nhttps:\/\/defyccc.com\/cult-of-climate-change\/?sc#3\n\nhttps:\/\/defyccc.com\/cult-of-climate-change\/?sc#4\n\nhttps:\/\/defyccc.com\/cult-of-climate-change\/?sc#5\n\nhttps:\/\/defyccc.com\/cult-of-climate-change\/?sc#6","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"I am a Climate Denier --post 9-- The Cult of Climatology"}

As atonement for my sins, I have decided to do a proper R1 of the kind of person I was acting in bad faith to, which is to say \/r\/the_donald. I\u2019m mostly using the context of a R1 as an excuse to talk about a topic that I\u2019d want to talk about anyway. I\u2019ve written quite a bit about the theory of international trade on the sister sub, but here I\u2019ll use t_d\u2019s dumb views on trade and a symposium from [the most recent issue of the JEP](https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/issues\/507) to talk about the real, empirical benefits of international trade to the United States.\n\nThe post I found from t_d that gives us the best introduction on how not to tackle the topic is [this post from just after the election](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/The_Donald\/comments\/5dm28h\/it_doesnt_take_a_genius_to_figure_out_why\/) . Which gives us some straightforward populist rhetoric to sift through about trade. Comments like this one:\n\n&gt;He says American workers are spoiled. I guess that's what the elite say when we want a decent wage.\n\nThe usual argument about how big business moves plants to areas with cheaper labor, thus taking jobs away from Americans. One can\u2019t deny the appeal of this argument due to its simplicity, but it has a few problems you\u2019re probably well aware of. Chiefly is the idea that there\u2019s some fixed, zero-sum number of jobs and that that fixed number will be diminished by foreigners \u201ctaking them away\u201d. This isn\u2019t true, [with a country like China specializing in a certain industry that they have a comparative advantage in, the US can specialize in a different industry](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/neoliberal\/comments\/6wkuwu\/why_trade_with_poor_countries_is_a_good_thing). That being said, there are real costs with this, David Autor et al. quite famously found the real negative effects on communities that were employed in industries targeted by import competition due to a \u201cChina shock\u201d in a 2016 paper. [But the overall improvement by way of the aforementioned comparative advantage allowing for more consumption than domestic production](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/e7jukFT.png), and the benefits of economies of scale are still real. So for now I\u2019ll take the time honored tradition of mumbling something about Kaldor-Hicks and proceeding to ignore the people negatively affected.\n\n**The Main Gains**\n\nThat\u2019s the basic theoretical framework, but I\u2019ve already done plenty of writing about the theory of this, what I\u2019d rather talk about here are the actual material benefits from international trade that the United States receives. Doing a calculation for this has a major hurdle, to do this calculation directly you would need to estimate indifference curves and production sets for the thousands of possible types of goods in international trade, once you had that you can estimate what would happen if the US switched back to full Jeffersonian autarky. To quote [this paper in the recent JEP issue](https:\/\/pubs.aeaweb.org\/doi\/pdfplus\/10.1257\/jep.32.2.3) \u201cthe amount of actual information required to implement the textbook approach is, to put it mildly, nontrivial\u201d. However, an indirect way around this can be found by by using the factors that go into these goods instead of the goods themselves, and you can look at demand for goods as indirect demand for those factors. This makes data collection and computation much easier, there are far fewer factors than goods and it\u2019s suddenly feasible to get some form of change in demands and indifference curves from empirical data, and therefore the gains from trade that the United States gets from access to foreign factors. After [some math that I won\u2019t pretend to understand](https:\/\/economics.mit.edu\/files\/7571) we get a formula for the gains from trade that takes [this form](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/DX4EmeF.png) where GT is the gains from trade, \u03bbD (reddit\u2019s version of markdown doesn\u2019t support subscripts natively) is the share of national expenditure on domestic goods and \u03b5 is the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign factors. The share of spending on domestic goods is fairly simple to obtain, the elasticity (we\u2019re assuming a constant elasticity of substitution across prices here) requires some estimation effort. Running some regressions we see that the median (somewhat uncertain) estimate of \u03b5 being about 5.\n\nFinally running all these numbers in various estimates in various different environments we get the perhaps somewhat underwhelming estimate of 2 to 8 percent gains from trade. This is a lot, but it might not be as much as one thinks. His checks out with similar estimates of the gains from international trade [that Japan experienced when it quickly went from autarky to openness](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FTs8qiOMh_o). However these are the gains from traditional comparative advantage, there are other potential gains to be had, and there is where we can get some truly staggering numbers. I should also note none of this goes over the benefits to free movement of people, [which are likely even greater](https:\/\/www.aeaweb.org\/articles?id=10.1257\/jep.25.3.83), and of course the_donald is very against.\n\n**The Alternative Gains**\n\n[Another paper from the recent JEP issue](https:\/\/pubs.aeaweb.org\/doi\/pdfplus\/10.1257\/jep.32.2.25) covers the issue of alternative gains from trade beyond comparative advantage, it focuses on three seperate points that we\u2019ll tackle one at a time here.\n\nFirst the gains from increased variety of goods that consumers are able to purchase. The gains from this can be calculated with a slightly modified version of the aforementioned equation. [A calculation using this](http:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w18113.pdf) gets the gains from trade at about 13% for the United States due to concentrated benefits of product variety in various important industries. (Somewhat concerning side note: This 13% gains from free trade is lower than most countries because of how much the US produced for itself and had *intra*national trade, and because of the way Trump appears to see things as almost entirely zero-sum, he might view the US having a devastating blow to their economy from a very large trade war as still worthwhile because the US wouldn\u2019t be as hurt as other countries, and would therefore be \u201cwinning\u201d.)\n\nSecond are the possible gains from a sort of accelerationism of creative destruction. The basic idea here is that as domestic corporations are exposed to import competition and more access to export markets, the most productive and efficient firms will expand more while the least productive and inefficient firms would die out. I find this particular aspect amusing because it stretches the belief I have in memey utilitarianism to about its limit, it\u2019s still an overall benefit, but celebrating the death of inefficient firms can make me feel a little like [this](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/nd97yscd40ly.jpg). Creative destruction is nevertheless an important and necessary part of long term economic development, and barriers to trade reduce this by allowing low productivity firms in certain countries to stay afloat with that.\n\nThird is the potential pro-competitive aspects of free trade. New trade theory very often uses a model of monopolistic competition (thank mr krugman) and introducing new firms into a market via international trade could reduce the markups in a monopolistically competitive market, as long shipping costs are low enough to make it worth it. Reduction of a markup isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing, corporation\u2019s gains aren\u2019t always bad (Mitt Romney joke goes here). However, the monopolistic competition model also has zero economic profits, meaning that a reduction in markups from increased market openness changes profits from zero to zero, with consumers gaining, a pure gain. This increased competition is unlikely to make a huge dent in GDP, but it\u2019s still worth noting.\n\n**The Costs**\n\nTo get a good faith argument for the gains from free trade in the US, it would be bad for me to just ignore the costs that some people incur from free trade. The thing that people like the included comments from t_d are complaining about is the real decline in American manufacturing employment. The usual things about Kaldor-Hicks still apply, but it\u2019s worth at least talking about least talking about this decline in more detail. There are two things that are generally talked about as the cause of this decline, the aforementioned import competition, and skill-biased technological change (SBTC). [We can\u2019t say much for sure about how much of the decline is because of which reason.](https:\/\/pubs.aeaweb.org\/doi\/pdfplus\/10.1257\/jep.32.2.47) What we can talk about is a some aspects about how this decline has happened. First, this decline has seemed to occur in two distinct waves. The first from the late 70s to late 90s in which manufacturing employment went down a decent bit but manufacturing output kept going up. And a second wave from the early 2000s through the Great Recession, in which manufacturing employment tanked so hard that output went down even with better technology. Another note is the fact that most of this loss is happening within firms, firms aren\u2019t going bankrupt as much as they\u2019re just shutting plants while staying afloat. It doesn\u2019t help the issue with telling which is the cause of the manufacturing decline that there can be some issues even telling which individual case is import competition or SBTC. Is a job that got automated as a reaction to import competition a job lost to import competition or SBTC? These questions are largely an unsolved problem and I don\u2019t have a particularly strong opinion on what exactly to blame for it. I do think that it\u2019s probably worth talking a bit about the mechanics of the costs that are still real while still arguing that the costs are still overall worth it, and if we want to fix these costs it should be through redistribution rather than protectionism (not dwelling on this point too much because it\u2019s pretty played out already).\n\nOverall, to suggest the US is losing from free trade indicates a zero-sum view of the world that only focuses on the losses while ignoring the very real and significant (even if perhaps less significant than we once thought) gains from a number of things. I hope I\u2019ve done a decent job illuminating the empirics of the real gains that people get. \n","subreddit":"badeconomics","title":"Yes, the United States gains from free trade.""num_comments":0,"score":6,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Yes, the United States gains from free trade."}

There is more than one understanding of these words that are thrown around daily.\n\n     Liberal is derived from the word \"liberty\" and it was historically used in connection with \"liberating the serfs.\" As the feudal system become obsolete, the peasant farmers found themselves legally bound to the land. They did not have liberty to move to town, get an education of some kind, or open a small business. They were basically slaves. Over a few centuries, they found this not to their liking, and there was a great social foment across Europe during the 1800's. Russia abolished serfdom, for example, in 1861.  \n\n      Modern liberals are those with sympathy for the poor and downtrodden, of which there are many. The Democratic Party has come to realize that mere liberty is not enough; you also need wherewithal. Accordingly, they have taken up the practice of buttressing their convictions with a taxpayer funded stipend or subsidy.  They have the numbers.\n\n     The conversatives, those who represent the business class, are the ones with money they would like to conserve.  For themselves, quite naturally.  Money gets you access to political power, and political power gets you access to lucrative government contracts. These days we call it crony capitalism.  You can find conservatives also, for example, among state sanctioned clergy. They, too, like things they way they are: tax exempt property and the state's power to compel certain behaviors for those not similarly situated.\n  \n     Over time, the liberals have had some success in bringing into acceptable social and economic life not just the poor, but the downtrodden among the disenfranchised including women, racial groups, the differently abled, religious minorities, and the LGBT communities.\n\n      The party of Lincoln, those who opposed the extension of slavery into the newly forming States, were the real liberals. The plantation owning Southern Democrats were the conservatives. \n\n      So, the liberals and the conservatives have taken each other's position.\n\n     Twenty-first century American conservatives claim to be the champions of limited government. Waiting for that.\n  \n     Twenty-first century American liberals don't have the confidence in Yankee \"can do\" spirit to hold themselves back from legislation, regulation, and a complex permitting and licensing system.\n\n      Now, the Democratic Party is ashamed of itself and more and more identify with the label \"Liberal\" (or alternatively, \"Progressive\") with a tax and spend policy.\n\n     And the Republican Party is ashamed of itself and more and more identify with the label \"Conservative\" with a tax cut and spend policy.\n\n     Stay tuned for further developments.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Define: Liberal and Conservative"}

I often see people decrying libertarians as callous sociopaths who don't care if people are starving in the streets. I always try to explain that I am in favor of helping people, I'm just not in favor of using the government to do it. Not only is government easily abused and wasteful, it's also less productive.\n\nFor example, any time\/effort\/money spent trying to get the government to pass a bill to increase resources for for the homeless would be better spent directly helping the homeless. Same goes for whatever groups you're interested in helping (veterans, immigrants, etc.). \n\nObviously there are some problems for which the government has a competitive advantage at solving (i.e. pollution), but so many of the issues that clog our governmental institutions appear to be more easily solved by private citizens working together. It's as if most people believe that collective action is only possible through government. \n\nDo you encounter this misunderstanding as often as I do? How can we combat it? \n\nI think the best response is to lead by example and get involved with non-government solutions.  That way, we libertarians can point to tangible results and and say \"while you're out there protesting the government to solve the problem, look at how we've actually started to solve the problem.

And no one has tapped into that better than Lauren Southern.\n\nNow the question is of course, is Lauren Southern a racist? The short answer is yes. But she is an interesting case because unlike the Jared Taylors or Richard Spencers she is not obvious about it, but then unlike someone like Milo she isnt nessecarily denying it either.\n\nBut to get your head around Lauren you have to first get your head around the company she keeps, now apologies in advance because we are going to be talking about some youtubers you probably don't give a shit about.\n\n\nFirst **James Allsup**, I think there was probably a time when he was just a basic bitch libertarian but the guy is about as racist as they come now.\n\n[Exhibit A] (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qzWIs1zNx2U&amp;t=196s)\n\nBy the way, feel free to ask him a very respectful question explaining why he was there and acting the way he was (praising david duke, and fangirling for richard spencer) and he will be sure to block you on twitter.\n\n[Exhibit B] (https:\/\/www.thestranger.com\/slog\/2017\/08\/15\/25349868\/wsu-student-james-allsup-wrote-hateful-posts-on-facebook-before-he-went-to-charlottesville)\n\nthis is just a magazine article about his overall nasty views but pay attention in particular to the anti-semetic shit where he starts saying jews aren't white and he can identify them by their 'big noses'.\n\n[Exhibit C] (https:\/\/dailystormer.name\/james-allsup-debates-a-race-denialist-on-race-realism\/)\n\nAnd yes, just in case you needed final proof he is a race realist and does judge people by skin colour. But tbh he advocates this a few different times in various streams and unrelated debates that you could find if you do some digging.\n\n\nNow on to **Brittany Pettibone**, she is very much in line with these views. American Identitarianism is a very fancy way of saying white nationalist. Its the idea that your identity (race, ethnicity) informs everything important about you and they cant be separated. So while you might be a civic nationalist and a proud right wing black who feels you can assimilate perfectly with right wing western culutre. Indentitarianism flies in the face of that. It will declare that as a black you have genetic pre-disposition not only to negative behavioral traits and low I.Q. but also to in-group preference where you will always end up advocating for your race over others.\n\nIf this sounds pretty fucking stupid  its because it is.\n\nHere is Brittany, James and Martin all covering and agreeing with these talking points. Note when Martin denoucnes civic nationalism and says you cant separate culture from ethnicity at 7:40\n\n[Racist Roundtable](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mJO_PkLJUHU)\n\nBrittany has referenced these ideas in other videos and trust me when she talks about the 'western' or the 'european' man to rise up and sacrafice everything to protect their land. She is talking about whites and whites only.\n\nSo yes, its a lot to read and watch but those 3 are undoubtedly all racist.\n\nNow on to **Lauren**. I honestly do believe either she is a racist, or she is just extremely clever at marketing to racists. But one thing I will say is that she walks the line very carefully. As of today I will not find Lauren calling herself a white nationalist or advocating for an ethnostate. BUT the martin Sellner guy that you found creepy actually met Brittany through Lauren. Because Lauren was working with and promoting his organisation (Generation Identity).\n\nNow with an honest  and objective lens on, tell me it isn't a little bit troubling that she is behind people like this, these are people who dont want people who look like you if your'e brown to live in Europe and definitely don't want you race mixing with white people.\n\n[Birds of  Feather Flock Together](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cgwerO355t0)\n\nAlso the fact that she is pallying around with not only Brittany and Sellner but fucking FAITH '14 Words' GOLDY paints a disturbing picture.\n\n[Proximity to real racists.](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DWJyON5rMKk000)\n\nand also shes a race realist, to me that's evidence enough of racial bigotry but check out what she says \n[at 2:02 here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rcsDSPLkyU0)\n\nAnd here...you can tell it was almost edited out, but you can catch it if youre paying attention where she says that white lineage and genetics really do matter.\n\n[at 7:47](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=x7wHWob4pkU)\n\nSo yeah I'm not blaming anyone for being confused about Lauren, because you have to a do quite a bit of digging to get to here. But I've had the time to really comb through this. Separating the regular right wing with the bold racists that have popped up in the last 3 years or so.\n\nLet me know what you think after you've seen the links.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Is Lauren Southern A Racist?

This is going to be a low quality R1 mainly focusing on what Friedman said and didn't say. Luckily I am a bit of an expert on that as I  have like 4 books of his on hand. \n\nI am going to try to make this a semi-decent R1 and not delve to far out of my depth. I am going to try to criticize the bad econ, mis-characterizations, and things that are just so obviously bad that it would be impossible to point them out. The basic format of this \"paper\" is that Block makes a fairly wacky definition of socialism and shoehorns Friedman's ideas into it before making a new wacky definition of socialism. I am also going to try to do this in the spirit of Friedman and try to play a fair game with Walter with mild teasing in it.\n\nStarting off with the introduction.... \n\n&gt;\"philosophy is commonly divided into\nsubjects such as ethics, metaphysics,\nepistemology, and also into schools of thought\nsuch as utilitarianism, deontology, ordinary\nlanguage (analytic), hermeneutics,\nexistentialism, etc.; sociology partakes of both\nstructuralism and functionalism; in economics\nthere are the Marxist, Austrian and mainstream or neoclassical schools of thought; in psychology\nthere are Jungians, Rogerians, Freudians,\nbehavioralists, etc. With all this plethora, is the\ndistinction between socialists and capitalists,\nalone, to be ignored? Hardly.\"\n\nSo right off the bat he starts off with the classic \"schools of thought\" comparing them as equals the like of schools of ethics or psychology (which don't seem to exist anymore.) The issue with this is that it implies that that they're on reasonable terms with each other like ethics. But the issue is that there are so few adherents to these \"schools of thought\" in economics nowadays that after an hour of searching I can't even find a statistic of how many Austrians there are, and I can count on my right hand the number of Marxist economists... So lets go with a blog post: https:\/\/artir.wordpress.com\/2016\/01\/12\/counting-the-austrians-economists\/\n\nedit: Changed link\n\nThis counts the total number of Austrian economists at 96, mostly clustered around GMU, as one would expect.\n\nLet's take a look at the number economists in the US from the [BLS...](https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/ooh\/life-physical-and-social-science\/economists.htm) 21300... unfortunately the years aren't quite right but assuming 1300 people just joined the econ profession this past year, that's still 0.5% or about 1 out of every 200. (EDIT: changed due to basic math error, forgot to multiply by 100 before converting into percent)\n\nNow when one takes a basic ethics class, they get smashed with both the perspectives of utilitarianism and deontology. The percentage of people who view the other side as having at minimum reasonable points is somewhere around 90% at least. Yet these other schools of thought aren't seen in 99% of econ101 classes... But maybe all the 20,000 econ professors are wrong and the lucky 96 are right.\n\nIn reality there are two schools of thought in economics. There is good economics, and there is bad economics. That's it.\n\nI shouldn't even really have touched on that because it's just mindless throat clearing... but I thought I'd include it.\n\nThe paper then goes on to quote a bunch of people who call Friedman a supporter of capitalism until he gets to this small but shiny gem...\n\n&gt;\"According to\nDoherty (2012), Friedman self-describes as a\nperson \u201cwho...preach[es] laissez faire.\"\n\nIf he self described as laissez faire... shouldn't you be able to quote the man instead of using what a man heard something the guy may have said once? I am not even disagreeing, but this here really shows how lazy this paper is. \n\nWalter then goes on to describe the definition of socialism as government ownership of the means of production for 3 paragraphs of further throat clearing. \n\nTime to delve out of econ for a bit and go into politics. Let's take a look at this paragraph... \n\n&gt;\"Suppose a nation\u2019s government owns\nnot 100% of all capital goods, but 90%, 80%,\n70%, etc. It what point does such a country\ncease being socialist, and begin its move toward\na mixed economy? The point is that there is a\ncontinuum (Block &amp; Barnett II, Continuums,\n2008.) in this measurement, as there is in many\nothers.4 States Hoppe (Hoppe, The Economics\nand Ethics of Private Property: Studies in\nPolitical Economy and Philosophy. Second\nEdition., 2006) in this regard: \u201cSocialism must be\nconceptualized as an institutional interference\nwith or aggression against private property and\nprivate property claims\u2026(Capitalism) on the\nother hand, is a social system based on the\nexplicit recognition of private property and of\nnonaggressive, contractual exchanges between private property owners.\u201d In like manner,\nwhether a scholar such as Friedman is a\nsocialist or not, depends upon where on this\nspectrum he lies, in terms of what percentage of\ncapital goods he wants the government to own.\"\n\nI doubt that any socialist would conceptualize of socialism this way. Socialism is not when the government does something. I could at least skip over this section if you just used the word \"statist\" instead. \/u\/prince_kropotkin please correct me if I am wrong.\n\n\nFinally after these almost 3 pages of throat clearing we finally get to the meat. \n\n&gt;\"First and foremost, this economist supported the\nFederal Reserve System all throughout his\nprofessional life.^6 \"\n\nNotice that footnote, let's take a look right there...\n\n&gt; \" cannot be denied that he was disappointed with\nthe fact that the Fed did not follow anything like his\nfamous 3% rule, but he did not join Ron Paul (2010)\nin calling for the entire elimination of this\norganization, root and branch\"\n\nYes. Because he died in 2006. Dead men don't join political campaigns. But lets take the generous view here that he's just saying he didn't call for the abolition of the fed, which is really strange because that k% rule really sort of does eliminate the federal reserve as we know it. It eliminates all fiddling around with monetary policy. Let's go down a little deeper to see how this is relevant... After he says this...\n\n&gt;\"It cannot\nbe denied that Friedman did explicitly support the\n\u201cend the fed\u201d movement. He stated: (long quote from money mischief)\" \n\nwhich is it Block? Did he or did he not? Were you right the first time or the second time? I think you were right the first time, but calling for changing the federal reserve from the economic equivalent of firefighters to being the equivalent of a conservation agency is a pretty big change dude. Taking away all the fed's power to make discretionary decisions and control the means of production of money is hardly worthy of the definition of \"socialist.\" If wanting to lower the amount of government interference in the economy more gradually than abolishing the government is socialism than the only people who aren't socialist are the people at the Mises institute. \n\n\nNow we can get on to the econ in this foot note:\n\n&gt;\"However, Friedman\u2019s ending of the fed is of a very\ndifferent variety than that of a Ron Paul or a Murray\nRothbard. The latter wanted not merely to \u201cend the\nfed\u201d but to call a halt to any government\ninvolvement in the monetary stock. Friedman\nwanted not so much to end the fed as to rein it in,\nlimit it to following his 3% rule for monetary\nincrease\"\n\nThe issue with monetary policy is that \"involvement\" looks a lot like uninvolvement from different perspectives and vice versa. What kind of policy is the federal reserve doing \"nothing?\" If it chooses not to change the money stock, it is effectively choosing to change the price level and interest rates. If it chooses not to raise the price level, it's changing the money stock and interest rates. If it chooses not to change interest rates, it's changing the price level and the money stock!\n\nWhich is the true inaction then? because it sure sounds like keeping the money stock at a constant increase at about the GDP growth rate is as close as it gets to inaction on the money stock and price level fronts. \n\nNow back to delving into the land of poorly defined phrases....\n\n&gt;\"Milton Friedman is a radical advocate of cutting\nall current ties, however weak, with gold, and\ngoing onto a total and absolute fiat dollar\nstandard, with all control vested in the Federal\nReserve System.\u201d Whenever people were free to\nchoose,8 they chose gold as their money, and\nsometimes silver. The \u201cgold standard\u201d is, then,\nproperly characterized as free market money.\nFriedman is clearly on the socialist side of this\nvery important means of production.\"\n\nWalt, [how do you know](http:\/\/img.timeinc.net\/time\/daily\/2009\/0906\/wfox_b_0622.jpg) that free people always chose gold? Because they didn't, anyone who knows anything about the history of money knows that people used pretty much anything and everything for money. And nobody knew monetary history as well as Friedman did. In Money Mischief Friedman quotes William Furness II's *The Island of Stone Money,*\n\n&gt;\"Their medium of exchange they call fei, and it consists of large, solid, thick, stone wheels, ranging in diameter from a foot to twelve feet, having in the centre a hole varying in size with the diameter of the stone wherein a pole may be inserted sufficiently large and strong to bear the weight and facilitate transportation\"\n\nFurthermore the gold standard of money really didn't start as something characterized as \"free to choose.\" In Egypt for example gold became money due to its standardization by the government after conquering and taking a hoard of gold from the Numidians. Hell, some people think money is a state construct. Hardly seems like something that is characterized by people \"free to choose.\" Simply sounds more like [its tradition](https:\/\/youtu.be\/2NJnL10vZ1Y?t=324). \n\n\n\nNext point where Milton Friedman is a socialist is \"the roads.\" \n\n&gt;\"Friedman was a road socialist. He favored^9\ngovernment ownership and control over the\nnation\u2019s highways and streets\"\n\nYes, so did Adam Smith (and Mises for that matter, but we'll get to that in a bit). And I think even Ron Paul supports some government ownership over roads but I'm not confident in that. Supporting some public institutions does not a socialist make. Unfortunately I can't ask him \"how does he know\" because he actually elaborates this time in the footnotes! He heard him support roads in a debate he had with him. You can see some of their correspondence here: https:\/\/mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com\/20_3_4.pdf?file=1&amp;type=document. Unfortunately it's mises institution stuff.\n\n&gt; \"Nor did Friedman support the full and entire\nconversion of all public schools to private hands.\nRather, he urged that the state maintain\nownership of these facilities and control them\nthrough a voucher system. If that is not support\nfor governmental ownership and\/or control over\nthe means of production, then nothing is.\"\n\nYes, because said conversion is impractical given the world we live in. Friedman wanted to remove state intervention from schools in a practical manner. The state in this case is not the sole owner of the means of production. In fact Friedman thought that a lot of under-performing state schools would be weeded out by the program. So a policy for reducing government ownership of the means of production is now socialist? Walter Block again ignores all context that may possibly refute his point. Furthermore, [How do you know](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/5\/5c\/Milton_Friedman_1976.jpg) that friedman wouldn't have supported entirely privatized education?\n\nFinally we can get back to something resembling economics.\n\n&gt;\"Another socialist and disastrous^11 policy of\nFriedman\u2019s (1962) was to support the concept of\n\u201cneighborhood effects.\u201d This is the idea that\nsince we all affect each other, this constitutes a\nmarket failure, and justifies government\nintervention into the economy. Rothbard\n(Rothbard, Milton Friedman Unraveled, 1971\n[2002]) explains:\n\u201cFriedman maintains that it is legitimate for the\ngovernment to interfere with the free market\nwhenever anyone\u2019s actions have \u2018neighborhood\neffect.\u2019 Thus, if A does something which will\nbenefit B, and B does not have to pay for it,\nChicagoites consider this a \u2018defect\u2019 in the free\nmarket, and it then becomes the task of\ngovernment to \u2018correct\u2019 that defect by taxing B to\npay A for this \u2018benefit.\u2019\"\n\nSomeone needs to go back to econ101. There's a difference between a concept and a policy and normative and positive economics  . The concept of neighborhood effects is a valid one, as empirically it's undeniable that people's actions effect other people. However the policy implications of it are quite in line with even the most staunch of libertarians.\n\nIf someone unintentionally blew up your property with a rocket launcher, does it matter if they were paid to do it or not? You'd be entitled to restitution! It's a basic fact of law that when someone damages your property, the person who damaged it pays the person whose property has been damaged! It being a free market or not doesn't mean squat. In this case the tax is more akin to a fine! [How do you know](http:\/\/www-news.uchicago.edu\/releases\/06\/images\/061116.friedman.jpg) that this method of enforcing property rights is socialist! You never elaborate!\n\nLet's also take a look at the footnote number eleven, \n\n\n&gt;\"I repeat myself here.\"\n\nYeah Block, real fitting for an academic paper don't you think?\n\nHere's another really weird passage, where Block says he's quoting \"The American Economy: A historical Encyclopedia.\"\n\n&gt;\"\u201cMilton Friedman provided the theoretical basis\nfor eminent domain \u2026 he described the forced\nremoval of particular urban neighborhoods and\ntheir populations as a necessary plan for the\nimprovement of the entire city. According to\nFriedman, as local governments selected\nneighborhoods for purposes of redevelopment,\na decrease in low income housing led to the\ndisplacement of poor populations. But the social\nconsequences for slum residents translated into\ngains for the greater community as luxury\napartments and commercial buildings replaced\ndilapidated buildings\u2026\u201d\nNow, it is indeed true that Friedman is in \u201cgood\ncompany\u201d on this matter, in that virtually all\neconomists, politicians and city planners would\nagree with his assessment. But, that will not\ndeflect in the slightest the charge that he is a socialist on this issue\"\n\nI haven't found anything from Milton Friedman on eminent domain. It's really weird. I can't find it in C&amp;F, Free To choose, his essays on freedom, anywhere. I think the encyclopedia is talking about neighborhood effects, but Milton didn't come up with those. That was Sidgwick and Pigou. (Pigouvian tax, anyone?) If anyone knows anything about this, please let me know. Unfortunately Block wasn't kind enough to do anything but claim he was in favor of it, and show that some encyclopedia agreed with him without answering the very important question of [\"How do you know?\"](https:\/\/cdn.britannica.com\/76\/81676-004-833CC829.jpg)\n\nNow we get to a rather brief paragraph that explains that socialism can be defined as \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.\" Which really would have better been introduced in a single sentence than a whole paragraph, but I'd really hate to harp on throat clearing yet again...\n\n\nSo now we get to another weird quote...\n\n&gt;\"What, precisely, is the\nnegative income tax? According to Allen (1993):...\" \n\nwith a drawn out explanation of an NIT.\n\n\nWhat is Walter's deal with using third hand sources? You can  find this in C&amp;F. It's almost like Walter wants to avoid quoting the guy because that might reveal some context that goes against his thesis. For one Milton Friedman directly stated multiple times that he would not be sure that he would support an NIT if starting from a blank slate IE. No welfare state. He provides a direct libertarian justification from C&amp;F that Walter fails to demonstrate is socialist reasoning, and simply goes on to say it's a transfer of wealth so therefore it's socialist.  Walt, [how do you know](http:\/\/www.nobelprize.org\/nobel_prizes\/economic-sciences\/laureates\/1976\/friedman.jpg) it cannot be judged on grounds of private property rights! If the government doles out favors to the upper class from the pockets of the lower, aren't the poor entitled to some restitution?  \n\n\nNext up is IO policy, antitrust laws and such.\n\nHe quoted Milton Friedman(!) with a paragraph from his essay on the subject that began with him saying that when he was younger he thought antitrust laws were good and then ends like this...\n\n&gt;\"And so over time I have gradually come\nto the conclusion that antitrust laws do far more\nharm than good and that we would be better off\nif we didn\u2019t have them at all, if we could get rid of\nthem.\u201d\n\nTo the sane observer, this sounds like it could not possibly be misconstrued as socialist. But not to Walter Block, who writes\n\n&gt;\"But this is not a root and branch attack on\nantitrust, of the sort taken by true libertarians.^17\" \n\nWalter, you never defined what true libertarianism is. Your footnote just has a lot of people being against anti-trust laws. You don't demonstrate how that is the only true libertarian position is. You don't even strongly demonstrate afterwards that supporting them is socialistic. How is this at all related to from each to each? \n\nIn other words...\n\n[How do you know?](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/302\/0*JPZ4Jmhv2Mck9yct.jpg)\n\nNow were going to skip a lot of unrelated filler relating to social discourse. He talks for a bit on embarrassment brought to people who call friedman a socialist (which may be caused by it being wildly inaccurate). He rates milton strangely enough at a 96 on some really weird scale from 0 to 100 on how \"socialist\" you are. This entire thing is just crazy town. He has no reasonable way of rating people, he's just going with whatever he feels like. \n\nWalt, Why do you figure that milton is in the 96th percentile of people on a ranking of socialist? Why Mitt Romney is rated a 7? [How do you know](https:\/\/necessaryandpropergovt.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/01\/milton-friedman1.png) any of this? Because honestly, it seems that you're just spitballing. \n\nWalt then goes on to say that even though admitedly friedman is less socialist than other people, he's still a socialist because of \"objective scientific considerations?\"\n\nWalt, this entire paper has been you rambling on about your personal opinions, taking things out of context, and using poorly defined definitions. This is not scientific by any means. And besides, you clearly fail your own tests for science as shown [here](http:\/\/laissezfaire.ufm.edu\/index.php?action=ajax&amp;rs=GDMgetFile&amp;rsargs[]=Laissezfaire34_6.pdf). Your definitions of libertarian and socialist are not consistent throughout this paper. Your qualifications have not been adequately supported beyond a doubt. You have not offered an objective yardstick of libertarian-ness or socialist-ness. Your methodology here does not even have the pretense of being an empirical science as you have avoided even quoting the man more than twice in more than a dozen of libertarian sins you accuse him of.\n\nNext section is on Mises, strangely enough. \n\nIt goes...\n\n&gt;If \u201csocialist\u201d includes those who favor any\ngovernment ownership or control, then of course\nMises would be a socialist as well Friedman.\nThat may be technically true, according to the\nauthor\u2019s definition, but then by what criteria to we\ndistinguish Mises from Marx, or Friedman from\nMarx?\n&gt;This is a very powerful objection, in that I am\nvery loath to consider Mises as a socialist.\nHowever, this objection, too, must be rejected.\nMises may have had one or two deviations from\ntrue laissez faire capitalism, or anarcho\ncapitalism; Friedman had more than a dozen.\n\u2018twas Mises who called Friedman a socialist, not\nthe other way around. Perhaps the most\npowerful argument undermining this objection is\nthat there is even a case to be made in behalf of\nthe claim that Mises was actually an anarcho\ncapitalist.\n\n\nMises did not call himself an ancap. He did not claim to be an anarchist and in fact criticized anarchists *including voluntary anarchists!* \n\nI forgot to mention that earlier he claim mises rated a 99. So block, where in this objective definition of socialist is the line drawn. Is it 97th percentile? 98? How many deviations from anarchocapitalism does it take? \n\nAnd Finally, [how do you know?](https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.azquotes.com\/picture-quotes\/quote-difference-between-me-and-people-like-murray-rothbard-is-that-though-i-want-to-know-milton-friedman-119-88-90.jpg)","subreddit":"badeconomics","title":"\"Was Milton Friedman a socialist.

This growth in a federal law enforcement presence has come at the expense of local law enforcement agencies, like county sheriffs, who have seen their authority diminished within their jurisdictions.\nIn addition to the loss of local control they facilitate, these federal law enforcement programs within public land agencies have become embarrassing examples of abusive power. These programs have become expensive to maintain. Worst of all, they have eroded public trust in federal land management agencies. As these programs are run by career bureaucrats, Americans have no recourse to remove bad actors from office.\nAs problematic as these law enforcement programs are on the surface, leaked memos and recent court proceedings have revealed that these law enforcement agencies operate from a culture of corruption that has led to heavy-handed and unnecessary enforcement tactics by agents who act as if they are above the law.\nIf it were necessary to have these law enforcement programs to ensure compliance with federal law, perhaps one could make the argument that they just need to be reformed. However, they serve no purpose that couldn\u2019t already be fulfilled by local sheriff departments and the U.S. Marshals.\nAccordingly, I believe Congress should abolish the law enforcement programs within agencies like the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service and empower local law enforcement to meet the law enforcement needs of communities with abundant federal land.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Trumps next step in Making America Great Again should be to abolish public lands."}

{"author":"thefisherman1961","created_utc":1530365963,"num_comments":3,"score":0,"selftext":"See below for a glossary of terms.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe Red Pill is the best explanation of the forces that drive the sexual marketplace, with competition being the most powerful of those forces.  Competition is inherently a masculine force, whereas anti-competition is inherently a feminine force.  This is true for one simple reason: when it comes to human reproduction, men have an abundant amount of sperm and women have a small amount of eggs.  The abundance of sperm makes a man nearly biologically worthless, while the comparative rareness of eggs makes a woman valuable.  Men must demonstrate that their sperm is superior in order to gain access to those rare eggs, and thus we must compete with each other in the sexual marketplace if our genes are to survive.  The best way to do this is by continuously raising our SMV.\n \nCompetition promotes growth, lower prices, profit, efficient allocation of resources, and raises the quality of life of everybody as equally as possible in the long run. Red Pill knowledge aids men in competing much more efficiently by helping them raise their SMV (growth), which gives them access to more (lower prices) high quality (profit) women.  The alphas get pussy and pass on their genes while the betas provide and get dead-bedroomed\/cucked (efficient allocation of resources), and it removes a lot of the genetically inferior betas from the gene pool (raises the quality of life for the most amount of people in the long run).  Competition is the name of the game.\n \nContrast this with its feminine counterpart, anti-competition.  Higher prices, monopolies, and zero profit motive - which promote stagnated growth, forced wealth redistribution, and a worsening of the average quality of life.  Socialism always fails because it destroys the pricing structure that is the backbone of how market forces efficiently communicate information to properly allocate resources, and replaces it with a central planning state apparatus that reallocates resources to the perceived benefit of those controlling the state.  That apparatus is the only way that monopolies have ever been created and maintained throughout history.  This makes sense because the state itself is a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force, thus it follows that the only laws it can pass are inherently monopolistic and anti-competitive.\n \nFrom youth, women receive male attention and validation for doing nothing other than existing. They never have to learn how to compete for access to men the way men have to learn to compete for access to women. Since men effectively have an infinite amount of sperm, there is no biological need for a woman to compete for Chad\u2019s genetics. He is more than capable of sharing his sperm with many women simultaneously, and in fact they *prefer* sharing Chad\u2019s sperm to having a monopoly on a beta\u2019s sperm.  The real problem for a woman is that other women represent a threat to her ability to monopolize a man\u2019s provisionary aspects (validation, attention, committment, and\/or resources), and her own SMV is the largest factor that affects that ability. \n \nA woman's SMV relies almost entirely on her looks, which are largely dependent on her genetics and how old she is.  Beyond taking care of her appearance, her control over her looks is extremely limited compared to men. So even if she did learn how to compete the way men do, it would be futile because it would not improve her SMV. Since it is impossible for her to outcompete other women who are genetically prettier than her, her only alternative is to *destroy* her competition.  \n \nTo do this, women ultimately seek to establish a monopoly on (LTR\/marry) their unicorn genetically superior provider (Alpha Bucks).  Many of them fail at ever accomplishing this. The older or uglier a woman who hasn't succeded, the more she will have to rely on attempting to destroy her competition.  That is why older women slut-shame so much and shame older man\/younger woman couples. If she can\u2019t monopolize Chad\u2019s provision, she will instead have to monopolize a beta\u2019s provision, possibly pop out some of his kids, and eventually attempt to reduce the risk of further passing on his genetics by dead-bedrooming him and\/or cucking him with Chad\u2019s baby.  In a nutshell, AF\/BB.\n \nLike any free market, in the sexual marketplace there are competing currencies whose values are determined by the consumers that engage in voluntary trade to create a stable pricing structure.  Women trade their currency (sex) for men's currency (provisionary aspects like validation, attention, commitment, and\/or resources). The higher a person's SMV, the more purchasing power their currency has. For example, a high SMV man can \"purchase\" a high SMV woman's sex in exchange for very little to no provision, wheras a low SMV man's currency is not valuable enough to purchase a high SMV woman's sex. Sex costs alphas less than it does betas.\n \nThe more currency that is in circulation, the less valuable a person's currency becomes. The more a woman gives out sex to different men, the less she can buy with it after each transaction. Every time a woman's n count goes up, that decreases the chances of her being able to \"buy\" provision from a higher SMV man.  Why would he want to waste his time providing her with those things when he would much prefer to provide them to a higher SMV woman with lower n count? Conversely, the more a man gives out his currency, the less valuable it becomes and the less sex he can \"buy\" with it.  A man who spends his currency too often - a beta orbiter, a guy that commits too easily, or a guy who spends too much literal money on a woman - is the male version of a slut, and that sexually repulses women.\n \nIf every woman was a huge slut, women's currency would become practically worthless relative to men's currency. The price of sex would nosedive for all men because any man could get sex with very little effort, and there would be no incentive for them to provide anything to women. In early human history, that would have been devastating for women and their children, so they evolved over millions of years to be more selective about the quality and quantity of their sexual partners. Instead of humans being purely polygamous or purely monogamous, we evolved the drive to pursue both polygamy and serial monogomy as a dualistic mating strategy. The market forces of evolution and natural selection have perfectly balanced the values of the male and female currencies relative to each other, so the pricing structure is stable and efficient. It is only when the state manipulates that pricing structure that the values of the currencies become artificially distorted relative to one another. \n \nIn the U.S., the state has a monopoly on the currency.  You are required by law to use the Federal Reserve Note as legal tender for payments of all debts, regardless of how badly the state destroys its value through inflation. Competing currencies have no legal enforcement.  Can you imagine if such backwards logic were applied to the sexual marketplace, where competing currencies were abolished and sex was somehow established as the monopoly currency?  Men would not be able to increase provision as a positive reward and withdraw it as a negative punishment; we would either have to be completely submissive to the feminine imperative, or drop out of the sexual marketplace altogether (MGTOW).\n\nFortunately, the state only has the power to distort the values of the currencies in the SMP, not abolish them.  The major way it does this is by implementing laws that reduce the reliance of women on men\u2019s provision such as welfare, alimony, and child support laws that disproportionately harm men relative to women. The state cannot establish sex as the monopoly currency because women are biologically programmed to desire provision from men. But if it could, it would be a true nightmare.  One can only use this analogy to speculate the insane amount of damage that legal tender laws have done to the U.S. economy.\n \nBeing feminine in nature, the Blue Pill is inherently anti-competitive. A man who does not compete in the sexual marketplace was either sold the blue pill lie that he does not need to (\"She said she will always remain loyal until death us do part!\") or has become jaded and turned MGTOW. Marriage is the way that women use government force to maintain a monopoly on their provider. He is far less likely to cheat or leave her if he is married to her because she can divorce-rape him.  The incentive for him to continue searching for high quality women has been greatly hampered, so his profit motive has been destroyed.  Thus, the blue pill man's SMV stagnates like any sector of the economy does when profit motive is eliminated.\n \nOf course, the loyal blue pill man likes to believe that marriage is a two-way street - that it is also *his* monopoly on his oneitis, but we know that is not true because AWALT.  She will dead-bedroom, cheat, and\/or divorce-rape him if the right Chad comes along at the right time, or maybe just because she is bored.  From a biological standpoint, the pros of her doing this far outweigh the cons. In fact, her hypergamy ruthlessly demands it.  Hubby's monopoly on her vagina is only an illusion; a fiction that exists purely in his mind.  Despite this, Blue Pill men have a defense mechanism that will cause them to do whatever they can to preserve this illusion through mate guarding, oneitis, marriage, etc., all of which are attempts to appropriate the female approach of anti-competition. A man acting like a woman is a beta sexual strategy and more than likely will backfire on him sooner or later.  Betas get what betas deserve.\n \nEven if a couple wanted to draw up their own custom competing marriage contract, it is illegal to do so.  The state has a monopoly on the definition of marriage - a definition that almost guarantees that in the event of a split, the man will get taken to the cleaners in family and divorce courts. Perhaps the couple wants a contract that would ensure a clean split with no possibility of divorce-rape.  Perhaps the man wants a contract that says he can divorce-rape his wife if she doesn\u2019t have sex with him whenever he wants. The point is that it should be up to the parties involved in the contract, not the state or some other third party, to decide what the terms of that contract ought to be. \n\nThe state excludes anybody who does not want its one-size-fits-all cookie cutter definition of marriage.  Anybody who does not agree to its terms is almost certain to be punished with higher taxes. Until recently, this negatively affected LGBTQ people, but continues to affect polygamists, MGTOW, and even heterosexual couples that want to draw up their own competing contracts. Under the current system, not even a prenup is guaranteed to prevent divorce-rape because a white knight judge can decide he doesn't like the husband's face, then declare that hubby didn't accurately list all of his assets at the time the prenup was drawn up, and throw the prenup out the window.  The cons of men getting married far outweigh the pros thanks to big daddy government and its monopoly on the marriage contract. \n\nWe can see very clearly how the state has massively devalued men\u2019s currency relative to women\u2019s, and how the anti-competitive nature of the Blue Pill has lowered the quality of life for the most amount of people.  The negative impacts of blue pill thinking on the quality of life of men are obvious, but what about for women?  Despite the advantages that blue pill third-wave feminist society gives women over men, it turns out that growing up without a red pill father, failing to secure commitment from an Alpha Bucks, riding the CC, getting alpha widowed by Chad(s), getting a college degree, having a career as a strong independent womyn, hitting the wall, marrying a beta, pumping out a few kids, divorce raping him, suddenly finding she's unable to attract the same Chads she did in her youth, and turning into a crazy old cat lady wondering \"where have all the good men gone?\" does not make women happy.  More women than ever are on anti-depressants and struggling with mental health issues.  The irony of third-wave feminism is that it is more harmful to women than helpful.  The feminine imperative, when not kept in check by the masculine imperative, is destructive to societies.  Makes sense when you consider that the average woman emphasizes feeeeeelz over logic, which is an inherently self-destructive and almost suicidal pattern of thinking.\n \nThe 80\/20 rule says that roughly 80% of men are betas and 20% of men are alphas. Since women make up about 51% of the population, that means that alpha males comprise less than 10% of the adult population. When you combine the force of government\/democracy with the feminine imperative and Blue-Pill thinking (all of which are anti-competitive by nature), the obvious conclusion is that there can never be any democratic government that is not hostile towards the alpha male. 91% of the voting population is voting against his individual sovereignty. His Liberty must take a backseat and his property must be redistributed for the supposed \"greater good\", which is obviously nothing more than false collectivist propaganda.  Since the 91% are the ones controlling the state, they control how the resources will be redistributed: for what they believe is their own benefit, of course.  And what they believe is their own benefit is not always what is actually for the greater good, but, as we\u2019ve seen, is in fact destructive to both individuals *and* society.\n \nIn a free market system, Billy Beta, and only Billy Beta, would be a woman's provider.  But 91% of the voting population has decided that society should be taking on the role of being providers *by proxy* through welfare, subsidized higher education, socialized healthcare in many countries, and various other government programs that benefit women.  This is not to mention the \"single tax\" levied on Chad for being unmarried. Thus, instead of resources being efficently allocated, Chad's resources get forcibly redistributed to women that he isn't fucking and would never otherwise provide for.  He could have used that money to keep improving his SMV and pass on his genes more efficiently. Instead, Billy now doesn\u2019t have to provide as much and has more money, Chad has less money, and it has forcibly decreased the gap between Chad's SMV and Billy's SMV. All else equal, the prices of valuable women have gone up for Chad and gone down for Billy. This is just one more way that the state has distorted the pricing structure in the SMP.  Chad hasn't just been cucked, he's been gang raped.  And gang rape is exactly what democracy is. Two people vote yes, one votes no, and majority rules.\n \nThe fact is that we do not need a welfare system because in the absence of a welfare state, private charity is far more efficient at helping the poor than government programs are.  According to [the late Dr. Milton Friedman](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hsIpQ7YguGE), 19th century America, which had zero welfare safety nets, saw the largest outpouring of charitable activity in recorded history and also saw the most rapid improvement in the poor's standard of living out of anywhere before or since.  In fact, our \u201call or nothing\u201d welfare system incentivizes the poor to not try to increase their income too much because once they they hit the hard cutoff point, they will lose their benefits and actually be worse off if they don\u2019t increase their income enough to make up for the difference.  Coupled with our failure of a public education system, they keep the poor trapped in an endless cycle of generational poverty. All of the evidence suggests that the poor would be better off if the wealth redistribution apparatus of the state did not exist because it is always used to redistribute wealth from the poor to the rich far more than it is used to redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor.  And it is used to redistribute provision from men to women.  And redistribute sex from alphas to betas.\n \nThe very existence of government requires initiating force against individuals to exploit their labor like they are slaves, i.e. taxes and\/or implementing legal tender laws so it can steal your purchasing power through inflation\/debt. If you do not pay your taxes, the government will ultimately resort to sending armed thugs to kidnap you at gunpoint and throw you in a locked cage for tax evasion. At the individual level, initiating physical force against another adult is tantamount to breaking frame. A man with strong frame does not initiate physical force against other adults; he only responds with physical force in matters of self-defense, and only when absolutely necessary. This logic does not change simply by transferring it from the individual level to the societal level: utilizing government to physically force your will on society is equivalent to breaking frame.\n \nBy electing statist politicians, the 91% are simply instructing people (Congress\/police\/military) to initiate force against others (YOU) on their behalf. Essentially, the democratic majority has weak frame because it has to use force to get its way when people do not voluntarily cooperate with its will, just like a beta who beats his wife for cheating. If the anti-competitive nature of third-wave feminism was such a good idea, it would not need to rely on force to be implemented.  People would simply voluntarily accept it based on its own merits.  But the fact is that it does need government force to be implemented, otherwise it would vanish because its arguments are false. Government intervention in the market has destroyed the rate of economic growth in the U.S., is destroying the middle class, unfairly transfers wealth, destroyed the costs of healthcare and education, destroyed our money's purchasing power, and has destroyed our Liberty. The Red Pill man simply cannot reach his full potential in a statist society because **statism itself is inherently incompatible with a Red Pill way of life.**\n \nFortunately, free market forces always have a way of bleeding through anti-competitive forces, usually through black markets and price corrections (recessions). Monopolies are inherently inefficient and will fail even when bailed out by government, which is why a woman's monopoly over a man through the government institution of marriage is collapsing. Blue pill society has massively damaged the economy, and specifically the dating market by keeping many men's SMV lower than it would be if they had not been sold blue pill lies.  It is causing both men and women to be increasingly unhappy and seek answers. Just like how free market economics are considered offensive by most of society, the Red Pill's taboo nature makes it a sort of black market of information about the SMP that was bound to come into being and take root sooner or later. Market forces demanded it as a correction. It offers a man the information he needs to correct himself and thus help correct the prices in the dating market so that higher value women become cheaper to obtain by raising his own value.   The Red Pill ultimately prevails because it is the truth and it works.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n**Glossary of Terms**\n\n* **Alpha** \u2013 Socially dominant. Somebody who displays high value, or traits that are sexually attractive to women. Alpha can refer to a man who exhibits alpha behaviors (more alpha tendencies than beta), but usually used to describe individual behaviors themselves.\n\n* **Alpha Bucks** - A woman's unicorn dream man.  He is always exhibiting the perfect mix of alpha and beta traits for what she wants at any given time.\n\n* **Alpha Widow** - A woman (typically but not necessarily post-wall) who has been abandoned by an Alpha male. No matter how great her new man is, she will perceive him as failing to meet the standard of the alpha she was previously associated with. Due to hypergamy, a woman cannot date backwards, once she gets say, a male 8, she cannot date below a male 8 and be happy with him. If she does, she is just using said man for resources (BB) and doesn't really love him. Essentially, a damaged woman accustomed to a tier of man she can no longer attract. See \"Post-wall\" and \"Hypergamy.\"\n\n* **AF\/BB** - Alpha Fucks\/Beta Bucks.\n\n* **AWALT** - All Women Are Like That. Often expressed after an example of hypergamy.\n\n* **Beta** \u2013 Traits of provision: either providing resources or validation to others, women (and perhaps men). Beta traits display low value to women if they are are put on too strong or too early in meeting- giving without equity. Beta can be used to describe individual behaviors, as well as people who have an overwhelming amount of beta properties (opposed to alpha).\n\n* **Billy** - Billy Beta.  The fictional archetypical beta male.\n\n* **Blue Pill** \u2013 From The Matrix and its sequels. The path of conformity with Society\u2019s expectations; the state of being unaware of the problems engendered by society. Compare with \u201cRed Pill,\u201d below.\n\n* **CC, or Cock Carousel** \u2013 The period of time in a woman's life where she successfully exploits her sexual value and maximizes her hypergamous tendencies by having sex with as many alphas as possible. Usually happens between ages 18 - 27. Often ends when the woman hits the wall.\n\n* **Chad** - Chad Thundercock.  The fictional archetypical alpha male.\n\n* **Cuck** - Cuckold.  A man who is unwittingly investing parental effort in offspring that is not genetically his own.\n\n* **Feminism** \u2013 \u201dA doctrine built on the pre-supposition of victimhood of women by men as a foundation of female identity. In its goals is always the utilization of the state to forcibly redress this claimed victimization. In other words, the proxy use of violence and wealth appropriation. In whatever flavor, and variation, these two basic features are common to every doctrine using the label feminism. Feminism is therefore, a doctrine of class hatred, and violence.\u201d (John The Other, \u201cWhy not date a feminist?\u201d A Voice For Men, 4 June 2012.)\n\n* **Frame** - The context in which something is perceived. Maintaining frame is often cited as the most important aspect of Alpha behavior. [See Iron Rule of Tomassi #1](https:\/\/therationalmale.com\/2011\/10\/12\/frame\/)\n\n* **Hypergamy** \u2013 The instinctual urge for women to seek out the best alpha available. This is marked by maximizing rejection (therefore women are the selective gender). A woman will vet her alpha through various shit tests to ensure his \"health\" on the alpha scale. She is conditioned to recognize a declining alpha, as hypergamy also tends to continue seeking out higher status males even while with an alpha male. Shit tests allow her to prepare herself for eventually leaving when a new higher status male is found. If the male fails shit tests to a great enough degree, it will effect her feelings for him. He will effectively lower his sexual market value in her eyes. This will enable her to jump to the next male with ease and little remorse.\n\n* **LTR** - Long Term Relationship.\n\n* **MGTOW** \u2013 Men Going Their Own Way; the growing contingent of the male population who are saying \u201cFuck It All\u201d to the Mating Dance. See \/r\/MGTOW\n\n* **N Count** - Number of different people that a person has engaged in sexual activity with.\n\n* **Oneitis** - When a guy has fallen in love with a woman in the same way a boy loves his mother. He obsesses about her, but she does not reciprocate.\n\n* **Orbiter** - Also known as Beta Orbiter. A beta guy who accepted the proposal to \"just be friends\" from a girl he has oneitis for. He will stick around her and constantly validate her whenever she requests it. Also known as \"friendzone.\" She will keep him around because he will do anything for her and provide validation, giving small hints that he might eventually win her love- but he never will. Typical signs of orbiter status: likes and comments on new facebook photos. Go-to guy when girl has problem with boyfriend. Also known as emotional tampon.\n\n* **Post-wall** - A woman past her peak beauty\/fertility. Depending on genetics, this can be a woman as young as 25 or as old as 40. Generally speaking, it is agreed most women hit the wall around 30. Women tend to become desperate to settle down around age 28\/29, realizing they have limited time to secure a quality mate as their beauty diminishes. See \"The Wall.\"\n\n* **Red Pill** \u2013 The recognition and awareness of the way that feminism, feminists and their white-knight enablers affect society. An awareness of the dark truths surrounding human sexuality; hypergamy, women's AF\/BB strategies, society's Feminine Imperative, sexual differences in emotional attachment, women's attraction to DT traits and sexual dominance\/violence; Extremely politically incorrect, expect reflexive social ostracism for even mentioning the red pill in polite society.\n\n* **Slut** - A woman with a high N count.\n\n* **SMV** \u2013 Sexual Market Value. A shorthand statement for \u201cwhat you bring to the table,\u201d whether for an one-night stand or for a longer sexual\/emotional relationship.\n\n* **SMP** - Sexual Market Place. A description of the free market that is mating.\n\n* **State** - an institution that has a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force in a geographic area.\n\n* **The Wall** - The point in a woman's life where her ego and self-assessed view of her sexual market value exceed her actual sexual market value; the beginning of the decline. Usually occurs as a wake-up shock to women when they realize that their power over men was temporary and that their looks are fading. This usually results with first denial and then a sudden change in priority towards looking for a husband. Even after hitting the wall, many women will squander a few more precious years testing her SMV with alphas to double-check, hoping her perceived decline was a fluke, this will make her even more bitter when she finally has to settle for a worse-beta than she could've gotten before because of squandering her youth.\n\n* **White Knight** \u2013 A man who \u201ccomes to the rescue\u201d of a woman, or of women, reflexively, emotionally-driven, without thought or even looking at the situation; (2) a man in authority who enables Team Women in his legislative actions, judgments, or rulings, reflexively, emotionally-driven, without thought or even looking at what\u2019s right.

How do you view having states (a state having an area with a border) within the US as good, but country borders bad? What's the difference? How can you believe we need a strong national defense and have open borders? This seems contradictory to me. I see borders as a line between cultures, that's why we have them. Ultimately borders are a way to protect the insides' way of life. How are open borders consistent within the libertarian framework? Without borders aren't you ultimately advocating for a global government? Am I missing something?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the discussion. At first i was thinking open and no borders were basically one in the the same. I see the difference now and thanks for clarification. A couple of you equated border protection as racist, which i dont understand at all. Is it racist to protect and defend your home? With my \"cultural protection\" ideas I didn't mean something like hotdogs and baseball, nor race. I was speaking of our basic way of life: Freedom of speech and religion, the right to bear arms, etc. Ultimately the government a population adopts is their agreed \"way of life\". They agree to behave this certian way and agree to a set of consequences for crimes within their borders.  States within the US have different laws, some vastly so. If you chose you can move to a state with laws that better suit YOUR way of life. You should be able to move to different countries as well for the same reason. Are these \"ways of life\" protected at the border? Well, not really, but the border does define the extents of where it applies, that's what i see as a good thing. In the end I think my initial argument was flawed from ignorance of open vs no borders. ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Borders are a good thing, change my mind."}
