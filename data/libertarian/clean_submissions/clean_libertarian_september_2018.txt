Also, I don't know how to tag this as long, but it is. \n\nTLDR: Monopoly of force allows for effective conflict resolution and so complex societies\n\nAn major issue for libertarians is the infringement of the state on personal autonomy. My argument is that without a monopoly on force, an effective state cannot rise, and instead is limited to small populations. \n\nIn the smallest of human populations, the social group consists of a family or closely related families of 20 or so people. This is the base nomadic group. Interpersonal conflict is limited, as other members have vested interest  in the conflict, such as a person being related to both conflicting parties. This allows for conflicts to be resolved without an central authority, but rather solely interested parties. \n\nThis concept further applies to tribes, consisting of multiple families, or clans. While the interested parties may not be related by blood, they may have a relationship with both opposing parties, and due to the small size of the tribe, an interested party is almost guaranteed. \n\nOnce we get to states, or at least groups of many thousands of people, the likely hood of an interested party dramatically decreases, solely due to statistics - there are so many more unique interpersonal relationships possible. \n\nThis means an central authority is required for effective conflict resolution, as without it,  states will disintegrate to the point where interested parties rise again.  ( Non effective conflict resolution causes conflict, preventing effective society untill conflict is resolved due to poor social conduct)\n\nSo where does monopoly of force (MOF) enter. If an conflicting party or parties are capable of a large amount of force, they can continue the conflict regardless of the central authority, unless the central authority has greater force. In order to do so, it must hold a monopoly of force to be able to provide effective conflict resolution. \n\nCounter arguments include\n- maybe smaller social groups are better then? But this loses the major benfits of larger societies, perhaps the most important being the releasing of a people from food production\n\n- if the central authority has a monopoly of force, how do you change the central authority? This argument is perhaps the strongest. You could argue that democracy is an excellent tool for allowing this, or that monopoly of force should always be able to be undone through civil unrest of an entire population. No easy answer here, but this argument doesn't really attack the concept of MOF being needed for complex societies.\n\n- But what if the central authority is biased? My argument directly avoids this question, because in truth it likely will be. The first part is that it doesn't matter in terms of compex societies, as the key point is that conflicts are resolved. The second is that increasingly complex societies allow for more complex organisations such as judical systems. \n\nIf you made it this far, nice work.  I'm always keen to hear counter arguments, and if you are worried that your argument will be missed, feel free to DM me.\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why Monopoly of force is a (pretty) good thing"}

Namely, the principle of restoring ownership of titles back to the descendants of those people who worked the land originally some years\/millenia ago.\n\nI'm also curious how people would go about enforcing that there's no ongoing deception and power games to enforce immoral contracts. Related, how would you go about confronting information asymmetry?\n\nGoing from the practical concerns outlined above, I'm not yet convinced of the virtuous nature of labor mixing without regard for the [lockean proviso](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lockean_proviso). The lockean proviso being a principle that Rothbard intentionally discarded, appealing to the moral virtue (or something?) of the legitimate heirs to the land, instead? How does that come together?\n\nLet's take a look at hypothetical and historic examples:\n\nIf I can make the rules as a matter of birthright over a set of scarce, natural resources, then I could see plenty wiggle room there for strategically withholding information from whoever who depends on my decisions (not to forget the opportunities to straight up charge rent). And if, as a result of that, I start accumulating more and more scarce resources that people depend on for their livelihoods, then we could quickly arriving in the situation called 'the tragedy of the commons'.\n\nConsider around 70% of peasants were kicked off of the land of the British lords some 80 years before the industrial revolution, as land started being useful as a commodity (for wool production). *(Source: Varoufakis in some interview; feel free to improve on this source if you get a more dependable account of 17th century Britain)*\n\nNow to further develop the hypothetical: Who is entitled to the land in this case? The lord who inherited it from their ancestors in quite reasonable ways at times, or the peasants who worked it for the most part? Or was there an informal (yet binding) agreement in place between the parties in the pre-mercantilist society that an anarcho capitalist would recognize? How do we come to agree on those matters without equal power between individuals in negotiations? Concerning those issues, what is the basis for consent building focused deliberation in anarcho-capitalism? Seems like a pretty central point if we want to maintain a functional and moral system.\n\nTrying to learn a thing or two here, please help out if you feel so free!\n\nP.S.

Get this, instead of smiles and happiness, the big screen t.v's were playing some absolute bullshit about Islamophobia, and the attacks in Quebec. This is the festival, I am not exaggerating or lying. Maybe it got better, I didn't stick around. A lot of the booths were about relief funds for Somalian refugees, and Syrian refugees. All the women had hijabs with the exception of some children. Even some of the really young girls only had their faces shown. It was the gloomiest shit I have ever seen.

When you leave the festival between city hall and the parking lot of square 1, every weekend a Jesus booth, sets up and hands out flyers. Regardless of the event they are usually there being ignored. Not this time, while waiting for a walk light, a muslim man was almost arguing with the Christian booth, \"you know this is a celebration for Islam, why not set your booth up somewhere else?\" and shit along those lines... I interrupted and took a flyer from the guy even though I am a Catholic. I told the guy \"Your doing Gods work in this sun.\" \n\nCanada has changed so much for the worse. If Islam is such a strong part of your identity, why not ask for Allah's blessing and fix your own country?

{"author":"ANobleLie","created_utc":1535995274,"num_comments":4,"score":3,"selftext":" \n\n36 wrongdoings of the United States political system and the American culture.\n\n1. An unequal legal system for men in favor of women. Gender should not play a role in punishment, and yet in the US courts punish men in general with much worst sentences.\n2. A legal system meant to punish rather than rehabilitate. If we wish to have a lowered prison population and less crime we must reduce the stigma of criminal history, as well as reduce punishment in favor of rehabilitation.\n3. Divorce courts favoring women over men. In regards to divorce court, when both mother and father are able to properly care for the children women and men should have equal access to the kids. As well as the disillusionment of alimony.\n4. Corruption rampant within the political system. US politicians have become far too little concerned with standing for the people and have become more worried about selfish matters. Such as job security in which they spend a majority of their time looking for endorsements and, donations for their reelection.\n5. Extreme bureaucratic inefficiency. The US government no longer cares about spending wisely and now wastes money on void projects with no end product simply to have people working.\n6. Major political parties not representing the people.  They have no attended to the care of the younger generations as they do not see their concerns as viable.\n7. Major political parties dominating the political sphere. Both Republicans and Democrats have made the marketplace of ideas amongst politics an impossibly. You must either be Republican or Democrat to play the game. This is one of the major things we were warned of by those who created our nation.\n8. Acceptance of radical ideology. There is a global trend of accepting violence or discrimination among any race or other skin deep matters. This needs to be erased in both the far right and far left.\n9. Lack of unity among ethnic and cultural groups. For the history of the United States the people were always united in the fact that they are American. This trend is leaving and thus we see our own countrymen as enemies.\n10. Public school and universities teaching dogmatic ideology rather than free thought. Schooling by dogma is only a trait of the profoundly irrational and intolerably ignorant. Whether based in political ideology or religious. We must fight that in our schooling systems.\n11. Reelection focused presidency. A leader's goals ought not be out of selfish ambition but out of want to do right by the people.\n12. Major violations of the citizens right to privacy. Our fourth amendment is all but non-existent with the patriot act as well as numerous other violations of public privacy.\n13. Interventionist foreign policy for non-major allies. The United States has no cause to defend other nations except for those who have defended us.\n14. US tax money spent on fixing poverty in other nations rather than US relative poverty. The government's concern should be first and primarily the citizens of our nation. Thus we must fix our own domestic issues before exporting our finances.\n15. Exporting American jobs to other countries. How can we justify sending well paying jobs to far off nations we owe nothing to when our own work for minimum wage. Simply we cannot without sacrificing ourselves and our neighbors for the profit of the few.\n16. Labor Unions making American labor too expensive. Care for employees is a must but it must be rational for businesses to be able to use American labor.\n17. Career politicians. Those who run our country should not have job security as that becomes their loyalty not the people.\n18. Politicians encouraging disdain against other groups. Politicians and by association large companies\/organizations foster dislike among groups to ensure their voting group stays loyal to them out of hatred for the other group.\n19. Overextended copyright laws. Companies should only have so much control over their product or ideas. The general public should not be excluded from advancements or creativity.\n20. Unjust invasion of the freedom of speech. Our freedom of speech ends before our fist hits the face of another.\n21. Citizens have a right to self protection. Citizens have the right to defend their loved ones and selves from intruders and oppressors foremost and especially their government by means of small arms.\n22. Over medication crisis. Overdiagnosis of mental illness and over medication have led to a population using unneeded medication and an over inflation the medication industry.\n23. Inadequate mental healthcare facilities. Mental healthcare facilities should have intense funding to make those who suffer with mental illness able to cope. \n24. Restrictions of ex-felons rights to vote. Ex-felons deserve their rights as Americans and if we wish to have less people in prison we must realize their humanity regardless of past trespasses.\n25. Underfunded public schooling with faulty curriculum. Education should be one of our top priorities for our children and the future of our nation.\n26. Overall negative few of masculinity when compared to femininity. Masculinity is acceptable just as femininity is and neither is. People should be accepted regardless of faulty stereotypes.\n27. Unfairly priced college and university making further schooling inaccessible to lower classes. Secondary schooling isn't a right but a need if we want to grow as a nation and as individuals.\n28. Obesity crisis unattended to by government. Everyone is entitled to spend their earnings as they please but the government and society at large should encourage the healthy lifestyle of all for the betterment of everyone and the individual.\n29. Government and companies making employees fear speaking their mind for the sake of job security. Employees should never be at risk of those their jobs for political disagreements or histories of unpopular beliefs. Only the utmost intolerable views.\n30. Internet being treated as an independent enterprise rather than a utility. In the past internet was just a luxury now it is needed for the everyday life of every citizens and should be treated as a utility just as electricity is.\n31. Focus on punishment rather than treatment of people with drug usage issues. Rehabilitation is the only way to go about solving our national drug epidemic not punishment. Portugal being a great example of such.\n32. Illegality of schedule 1 drugs. People have a right to put what they want into their body so long as it is under their own free will and not at the expense of other in any direct or physical manner.\n33. Extreme wealth gap. The average citizen should have more access to the wealth of the nation. However, this should not be done by theft of the 1% via over taxing but through an increase in the minimum wage, a better business environment with for those who give their wealth to projects that further the country, as well as tax incentives for those who fund projects that further the country.\n34. Reduction of amount of US military bases globally. We can much better defend our nation if we relocate our spending on unneeded bases and focus on giving benefits to those who have offered themselves to our nation.\n35. Lack of initiative in global denuclearization. Global denuclearization should be a main objective of our government as ever person and every nation the world over loses with even a small nuclear conflict. \n36. Less trade dependent policies. We should be a nation first and foremost based within ourselves. We must rely on ourselves and our neighbors before we rely on the outside except in the most desperate of times. This is to protect ourselves from the world at large.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"On the US political and cultural atmosphere."}

Similar environments are military bases, monasteries, schools,  socialism, and communism.\n\n**Stockholm Syndrome**\n\nHostages often become permanent true believers in the cause of their  captors. In other words, people are likely to become permanent true  believers in the cause of those who wield extreme power over their  lives.\n\n**Purges**\n\nIn countries such as China, Cambodia, and the USSR \u2026 those people  having any genetic predispositions that made them more likely to value  truth or freedom, to question authority, or to think for themselves  (those who carried the [Soul Of Humanity](http:\/\/endofinnocence.com\/the-soul-of-humanity\/)\u2014the  peak of human evolution) were either killed or imprisoned, and thus  such genes were mostly purged from the gene pool in those countries. In  the 20th century alone, hundreds of millions of people were killed,  imprisoned, or otherwise neutralized by their own governments.\n\nOne can easily see how a similar thing happened on a smaller scale again and again throughout history.\n\nAlthough the European invaders similarly purged the Native Americans,  America has been the best combination of freedom and prosperity for  everyone else, and it has thus collected those individuals who fled such  tyranny elsewhere.\n\n**Illusion Of Legitimacy**\n\nTyranny often disguises itself as the will of the people so that it will encounter little resistance. This is known as [The Illusion Of Legitimacy](http:\/\/endofinnocence.com\/beyond-piercing-illusion-legitimacy-social-contract-psyop-zero-squad\/).\n\nBy masking its use of such tools as: front men, false flag events,  propaganda, rewards, and punishments; the establishment can actually  manipulate the will of the people, which helps it to maintain the  illusion of legitimacy. Naturally, such a manipulated people will then  insist that the will of the establishment is indeed the will of the  people; whereas, the people would naturally rebel if such tools were  obvious and in their face, and if they they could clearly connect their  pain to the will of the establishment.\n\nOf course, such a deceived people are not as irrational as they seem  because for the people to be that deceived in a seemingly open society,  then they would have to be protected from alternative views, which would  require the existence of a globally dominant cabal, which seems  astronomically unlikely\u2014except that we now have a simple, self-evident, [ironclad proof](http:\/\/endofinnocence.com\/they-live-cabal-nwo-conspiracy\/) that such a globally dominant cabal exists.\n\n**Hierarchy**\n\nMost people feel compelled to comply with the power of those above  them in a hierarchy because those whose genes made them more likely to  challenge those who had the power to kill or punish them would have been  less likely to pass such genes down to future generations.\n\nDominance hierarchy has been in our genes for hundreds of millions of  years before we were human, so it is not seen as a perversion by hardly  anyone.\n\n**Tribalism**\n\nI\u2019m just going to quote directly from [Racism Explained](http:\/\/endofinnocence.com\/racism-explained\/):\n\n&gt;We are not the product of *everyone* before us. We are the product of *only*  those before us who got the most offspring into future generations. We  are thus the offspring of those men and women, and have the same  genetically programmed impulses that got more of their genes into future  generations. To be clear, *we* have those same genetically programmed impulses.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;One genetically programmed trait that would help *all* humans  get more of their genes into future generations would be distrust of  those passing through their territory. The reason that distrust of  transients would better protect one\u2019s genes and one\u2019s life, resources,  and offspring is because transients are indeed less trustworthy, because  \u2026  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Transients have no stake in the future of your community.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is obvious how one\u2019s life, resources, and offspring are at far  greater risk from a minute of exposure to transients than from a minute  of exposure to the folks in one\u2019s community. In a nutshell, a transient  has an incentive to take as much from a community as possible before he  moves on, and he would then be harder to track down and punish.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;However, one\u2019s genes are also at risk in less obvious ways. For  example, a man traveling through a community will feel the genetically  programmed urge to impregnate women there and move on while that  community then has to redirect some of its resources from raising the  children having their genes to the child having the transient\u2019s genes.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Therefore, the men of a community will have evolved the genetically  programmed urge to kill or drive out the transient out as soon as  possible or make him stay and marry the woman he tried to impregnate; and although that potential pregnancy would give the transient male some small stake in the future of  the community, he has the capacity to move on and impregnate other women in other  communities, so that would be his strongest urge.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Genes are not rational however, and it is not as if they can directly evaluate who is transient and who is not \u2026  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*The genes that protect us from transients would thus operate by making us fear those who look and act differently.*\n\n**Conformism**\n\nOnce a particular tyranny is the norm, most people will feel  compelled to conform because the genes that made people less likely to  conform would have made them more likely to be kicked out of the cave  (clan, tribe, etc.), which would have made such genes less likely to get  passed down to us.\n\nConformism in our genes is probably as [different for men and women](http:\/\/endofinnocence.com\/men-women-differences-behavior-psychology-evolution\/)  as observation and tradition tells us it is because a man who was  kicked out of the cave might survive, but a woman would have died, and a  man who *survived* must have had superior genes, so any women  having a genetic mutation that compelled them to go to the edge of the  territory where such an independent minded male would have found them  would have thus been impregnated by superior genes. Their offspring  would thrive, and we would see some men today who seem compelled to  think for themselves, and we would see many women today who are  attracted to such men. Of course, we would also see many men today who  thus pretend to think for themselves (e.g. politicians).\n\nConsider that those people having the strongest genetic  predisposition to conform will naturally find themselves on the side  where the establishment has their back, and they will naturally be the  biggest defenders of tyranny, which is exactly what we see in America  today with the so-called left.\n\nUntil about 1965, America was formed out of those individuals in  other societies who were less likely to conform, and thus the globally  dominant cabal has been trying desperately for about 100 years to change  the demographics of America to be more conformist, and as of 2015, they  had succeeded so thoroughly that they moved on to the next phase in  which they began throwing their success in the face of those who still  cared about America\u2019s founding principles of individual liberty. Such  provocations by agents provocateur, by controlled opposition, and by the  controlled establishment media are obviously intended to provoke a  reaction that could then be used as a pretext to disarm the people, to  create even more of a police state, and to create a global government.\n\n**The Solution**\n\nWe\u2019ve all met plenty of people who would rather die than look weird. That\u2019s why [the mainstream is crazy and extreme](http:\/\/endofinnocence.com\/mainstream-crazy-extreme\/). Here is an excerpt from that article:\n\n&gt;The mainstream will support corruption, injustice, and **tyranny** \u2026 rather than risk looking extreme.\n\nNow contrast the mainstream with [the people of Cher\u00e1n, who kicked out the government, and who are doing much better than before](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SrPBdLiqMb0).\n\nThe people of Cher\u00e1n have been left alone thus far because they are  basically an Indian reservation, but if they become any bigger of a  threat to the illusion of legitimacy, then unfortunately that threat  will be neutralized\u2014just like every other threat to the illusion of  legitimacy.\n\nCall the system in\u00a0Cher\u00e1n whatever you want,  but the people of Cher\u00e1n kicked out all existing government, and  replaced it with far smaller and more accountable government than  before. Their voluntary militias and their other voluntary  efforts do not count as government because government is a monopoly on the right to  initiate force in a geographical boundary.\n\nNo doubt they will make some of the same  mistakes that socialists and communists make, but they seem to be  capable of learning from their mistakes\u2014[just like the first Americans](http:\/\/endofinnocence.com\/communism-free-markets-plymouth-rock-jamestown\/).\n\nThe next leap forward could be [The Rule Of Market](http:\/\/endofinnocence.com\/rule-of-market-anarchy-capitalism-future\/), or maybe it will be [The League Of Real People](http:\/\/endofinnocence.com\/league-real-men\/)\u2014or zero squads.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why People Make Excuses For Tyranny"}

I see that there\u2019s a lot of Trump hate here regarding his trade policies. I agree with the sentiment that tariffs aren\u2019t good, I also see them as a means to an end. Their purpose, according to the administration, is to force China to change its behavior. If this were actually true, and these tariffs were temporary, would anyone here change their minds regarding them? I say this because I approach libertarianism like all other things, too much of it is not necessarily a good thing. Talking to China hasn\u2019t appeared to change their mind and these tariffs have apparently gotten their attention. \n\nI also extend this line of thinking to immigration. I believe that as time goes on, the world, especially North America, will become more integrated, which is good. But at this moment in time, I can\u2019t support the free movement of people from poverty stricken South American countries into the US. I say this as a Hispanic who has fled the failed socialist policies of Puerto Rico. \n\nTL;DR Does anyone here really think pure, unfiltered libertarianism is always good? Or is there room for temporary measures meant to achieve certain goals?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Thoughts on Trade?"}

{"author":"HTownian25","created_utc":1536177540,"author":"jnshhh","created_utc":1536157615.0,"num_comments":9,"score":75,"selftext":"Recently I noticed how much economic ignorance there is in professional sports.  Whereas the free market is about competition and choices, sports are full of unnecessary regulations.  There are so many limits on competition that is boggles the mind. So much so that I can't even watch it because it reminds me of Stalin.  But sports could redeem themselves by using market principles like everyone else for once.  It's time to make sports for red blooded real Americans, and not for Trump Haters like Lebron James and Colin Kaepernick.\n\nIntroducing Free Market Sports\n\n1.  Let teams accumulate all points from previous games.  Yeah, it's not fair, some might say, but they earned those points.  Stop the social engineering of making the game tied at 0 at the beginning.  Or tallying 'wins' from the beginning of the season.  This ignores the legacy and hard work of those teams.  Some of them going back 50 or 100 years or more.  Is it any wonder athletes hate America when they have been coddled by this egalitarian foolishness for so long?  Time for market principles over socialism.\n\n2.  Let teams play as many players as they want during the game.  This will allow more Americans to live the dream of playing professional sports.  Getting them off welfare for good.  Especially the 'urbans'.  It will only hurt pampered athletes who have been treated like royalty for too long. It will decrease brain injuries when there is less (or almost no) individual physical movement and everyone can just be replaced at any time.  We don't know how many players should be on each team, so let the market decide if it is 5, 11, or 158.  Also certain plays could use 100 players but others might only need 79.  Let teams decide what is best for their team and not self-interested referees who have often never played a real game or owned a large collection of people in their lives.  Best of all, though, it crushes the unions.  \n\n3.  Let team owners buy points using their hard earned money.  They should be able to pay each other for points or have them pay the league for those points.  This lets expansion teams accumulate the points needed to catch up with established teams.  And rewards money-making opportunities --  theme parks and restaurants -- over arbitrary factors like the game or whatever.  The main system of 'points' should be for exchanging with other teams for money and not for its own sake.\n\n4.  End the rules on how big fields and courts should be.  Or even what materials they should have to use.  Some newer teams might like to start out on smaller fields because it will cost less at first.  Regulation only allows established teams to keep out smaller teams.  Let elementary schools start their own pro teams using their gymnasiums and considerable number of players.  Let Urban Youth in the Inner Cities start their own pro basketball teams on outdoor courts.  Millions of Americans who can't play sports would also like to start their own small team.  And getting rid of red tape allows that dream to come true. \n\n5.  Let players play during time outs.  If they want to keep playing, they should.  Only some players need instructions from the coach or rest.  But other players want to keep working hard accumulating points for the owners.  When players are more numerous there is no need for breaks anyway.   Fans don't like delays and they shouldn't have any.\n\n6.  Allow teams to play multiple games at once.   Currently there are rules on the total number of games per season, and rules that say you can't play in multiple cities at once.  But a hard working team, with a roster of thousands of players, can easily play 10-20 games at once all over the country.  This will allow them to hire even more players.  And will again allow newer teams to catch up to established teams more quickly by accumulating points faster when they don't have the capital to buy points.  This also frees teams from being based in one city or needing busses from location to the next. \n\n7.  Get rid of the offseason.  In a true market system, teams will be playing games every single day all day long and all over the country.   Allowing more people to be hired and also more viewers to be entertained.  Lower ticket prices will result from cheaper playing arenas and more games.  More merchandise will be sold when there are jerseys for hundreds of thousands of players and when the game on people's minds constantly instead of only a few months out of the year and few hours out of a day.  Also, because that merch buys points for the team.\n\n8.  Stop recording stats for individual players, a waste of time and resources, and give that credit to those who deserve it:  the team owners and general managers.  Without them, players wouldn't even get hired in the first place!  Also, there will be too many players to possibly count all of their stats in a real free market.  You will just accumulate everything at the end of the game as a whole.  Somebody has to take credit for it, though.  And that guy will likely be rewarded with a bonus for what he did for you.\n\n9.  Instead of having self-interested career referees (boo!) punish players for penalties, let the teams deal with it themselves.  That can be done through paying the other team off or firing the offending player right away so they can be replaced with more obedient players.  Or maybe the penalty is not really a penalty but just how the game works now.  No sense in ruining the game if that is the case.  \n\n10.  Stop having games end after arbitrary time periods.  Have them go on as long as the players can last or until all the merch and food is sold.  Referees don't know what is best for employees, only the coach or manager knows that.  Some teams might have the manpower to last for a few days or even weeks in a game. Some fans can sleep in their seats and buy merch for days on end.  It's a wasted opportunity to earn money if they play only for a few hours.  Alternatively, some towns are poor and don't buy very much merchandise.  And those games can be cut short so they can move to another town quickly.  Also, in free market sports, teams won't worry about 'wins' but the amount of points they've rack up over decades with countless numbers of games and players that hardly anyone remembers.  This allows them to quit a game at any time to go elsewhere without shame.  Or even just leave players stranded in a town if they aren't needed anymore.\n\n\n","subreddit":"EnoughLibertarianSpam","title":"A Basic Economics\/Free Market Guide to Making Sports Great Again""num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"A Basic Economics\/Free Market Guide to Making Sports Great Again"}

{"author":"[deleted]","created_utc":1536185974,"num_comments":16,"score":5,"selftext":"Healthcare is a matter of life and death. Whatever your political alignment, it's important to get it right. Obamacare kind of sucks. Prices went up since Obamacare happened because I don't think that most liberals were counting on the capitalists they rail against so much to manipulate this complex, bureaucratic structure to aid in their greed.\n\nThis is why laws need to be simplified. The story, however, got turned into \"righteous liberals of progress\" vs. \"evil\/backwards conservatives who don't care about old people or people with diseases.\"\n\nIt's kind of a travesty, and it's part of why Obamacare was somewhat of a failure. There are several REAL problems with healthcare right now that have NOTHING to do with political alignment:\n\nThe cost of medical school is astronomical, and acceptance rates are low, meaning doctor's salaries are insane. Patents are being manipulated so that other providers cannot compete, and generic drugs require FDA approval - and the FDA appears to be either incompetent or corrupt, and likewise, generics take a long time before they're approved.\n\nInsurers look for ways to avoid paying out what they appear to claim to pay out. They do the classic \"make vague statements that imply you're getting something, when you're actually not.\" I.e. my high-buck insurance didn't foot the bill for an ER visit - it was out of a health-savings account. Greedy, manipulative shit-stains. But I believe that the free market and the power of individuals should be used to fight this nonsense. \n\nAnd these are the people who raise prices because Obamacare offers subsidies. So, we're just paying taxes to fund insurance CEO's Ferraris. Wait, but how does that work? Supply and demand curves. Subsidies sound great, but it increases the price. And the shape of the healthcare curve is tilted to favor insurance companies and not people, sort of like cigarette taxes hurt smokers more than tobacco companies. Except, your life is worth everything, so you'll give everything to protect it.\n\nThe only way to save insurance is to dramatically increase competitiveness, thwart drug company regulations and dramatically increase the accessibility of becoming a doctor.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How Can We Actually Fix Healthcare?"}

He allegedly turned $80,000 into $1.2 million in only four months, investing in stock options of companies based on private information about merger activity. Kendricks\u2019 friend, Damilare Sonoiki, worked for Goldman Sachs and fed him insider information that guided the trading scheme. Ultimately the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) noticed the over 1400% total return Kendricks achieved in four months and started investigating (Yahoo Sports).\n\nWhy is this story significant to the average American? Most people are not aware that our Congress people, our LAWMAKERS, actively trade on insider information they acquire from their work. They are able to do this legally because they manipulated the laws to protect themselves from investigation. Approximately 30% of Congress people actively trade in the stock market, both Republicans and Democrats. The top 12 traders accounted for over 14,000 trades in the last two years, making millions on insider information (Politico). In other words, a large proportion of our Congress people have an extremely lucrative side hustle, as well as blatant conflict of interest problems with regard to their positions on committees overseeing the industries and companies they invest in. \n\nIn 2012 President Barack Obama passed the STOCK (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge) Act, which greatly reduced the volume of trading being conducted by Congress people (Politico). However, the Act was modified just a year later by another bill (S.716) that backtracked key pieces of the original legislation. Namely, the bill eliminated the online public disclosure element of the original Act, making it very difficult for the public to access the records of Congress peoples\u2019 trades because they are kept only on paper in Washington D.C. (Congress.gov).  The Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent in 10 SECONDS; the House took 14 seconds (Reuters). \n\nThis activity needs to stop. It\u2019s INEXCUSABLE that the people elected to represent us are taking advantage of their positions of power. Rather than spend time promoting and lobbying for legislation that improves their states and communities, they auction their votes to the highest bidders and trade favors for private information. I want everyone to know about this hypocrisy that stands at the heart of our country\u2019s governmental issues\u2014greed is the status quo. Finance reform has happened in the past, and Congress has passed new amendments, new loopholes through which to get their dirty money.\n\nWe need serious change. The logical first step is to reach more people about this issue and start a public conversation. NFL football players\u2019 choice to stand or kneel during the National Anthem has inspired hours of discussion on race relations in our country. Why not talk about the transactions that truly drive our politics? Not a political stance, but a critique on the entire system. Have the results been satisfactory in your state? Do you believe your representative has your best interest at heart? Or do you believe they just want to be reelected so as to continue trading their accounts to supplement their modest salaries as public servants?\n\nOur Founding Fathers designed our government to derive its power through its electorate so that any problems could be solved at the voting booth. However, in a systematic plot drawn out over the course of a century, our representatives have erected barriers that prevent us from stripping their power. Besides the obvious fear-mongering, voter suppression, and legislation against term limits and campaign finance reform, our governing body\u2019s greatest weapon has been drilling into the American people a sense of HELPLESSNESS, BOREDOM, and APATHY when it comes to their power as voters. By casting Capitol Hill in a shroud of detached omnipotence, our representatives have convinced the American people that subversion and disregard for the law of the land is the norm, while punishing those like Mychal Kendricks to push the false narrative of Law and Order. \n\nPlease DO NOT SUCCUMB TO APATHY. Take the issue of dirty money in politics seriously because it is a primary, if not the sole driver of our political direction. The only thing we can do is the only thing we ever could do: every two years our Founders endowed us with the power to uproot and purge the establishment of the evil that threatens us. I implore you to SPEAK UP and exercise this power to VOTE.\n\nI wrote this monologue in hopes that one day our Congress people will be held to the same legal standard as every other American citizen. Mychal Kendricks and his buddy at Goldman Sachs got nailed for their trading scheme; members of our Congress have profited on an even larger scale for years and will continue to so indefinitely.\n\nI encourage you to do your own research and see for yourself the way our Congressmen abuse their power by exempting themselves from the laws they create for everyone else. Please, share this article with your representative and see how they feel about this issue.\n\nFor more information on the STOCK Act, specific Congressmen\u2019s financial disclosures, Mychal Kendricks\u2019 trading scheme, or a list of laws that do not apply to Congress read through the sources below:\n\nPolitico study including specific Congressmen and examples of their shady transactions:\nhttps:\/\/www.politico.com\/story\/2017\/05\/14\/congress-stock-trading-conflict-of-interest-rules-238033\n\nYahoo Sports article about Mychal Kendricks\u2019 trading scheme with Damilare Sonoiki:\nhttps:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/heres-brazen-aggressive-feds-say-lb-mychal-kendricks-alleged-insider-trading-scheme-015829230.html\n\nReuters article about STOCK Act Amendment:\nhttps:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/net-us-usa-congress-security\/congress-quietly-repeals-plan-for-internet-financial-disclosures-idUSBRE93B0ZJ20130412\n\n1) STOCK Act pdf, and 2) the amendment that dismantled the original law\n1) https:\/\/www.gpo.gov\/fdsys\/pkg\/BILLS-112s2038enr\/pdf\/BILLS-112s2038enr.pdf\n2) https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/113th-congress\/senate-bill\/716\/text\n\nLAWS THAT DO NOT APPLY TO CONGRESS\nhttps:\/\/archives-democrats-rules.house.gov\/Archives\/jcoc2ai.htm","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"HOW CONGRESSMEN BEAT THE STOCK MARKET BY MILES"}

It is not reasonable to have 100% free speech all the time, and so limits are put on free speech, depending on the forum, allowing everything that is above being a simple annoyance or call to violence, like shouting \"Wolf!\" or \"Fire!\", or meaningless racist\/sexist slurs.

Furthermore, I personally support a two-tiered prison system: a rehabilitation center for lesser felons like thieves and moderate violence like assault and a higher security, more classic prison for murderers and rapists.\n\nIf you can simply get half of our inmates (drug users) back into the work force through rehabilitation, that's a tremendous cost that society doesn't have to bear. If another half of inmates spend much less time and are part of a focused rehabilitation program, that also reduces the cost on society and increases the potency of the work force.

{"author":"PrestigiousProof","created_utc":1536413826,"num_comments":11,"score":0,"selftext":" \n\nWhile  many doctors, citizens, patients and victims, have been trying to  inform the public for many years about the uselessness and the risks of  the HPV vaccine, a new offensive of the pharmaceutical lobbies and  politicians are trying to introduce laws to make vaccination compulsory.\n\nHere  we have analysed the benefit-risk of this vaccine originally intended   for women, but boys are likely to be targeted as well and denounced  several times its uselessness coupled with its risks, both in women and  in men. **The time spent since FDA\u2019s  marketing authorization in June 2006 only adds new arguments against  this vaccination, the strongest of which is the increase in the number  of cervical cancers in the vaccinated population. This should encourage  these countries to follow the example  of Japan and Austria and to  delete the recommendation.**\n\n\u00ab *There  are more than one hundred and twenty kinds of human papillomavirus  (HPV), and fifteen are considered to be at high risk because they can  cause cancers including HPV 16 and 18 causing 70% of  infections.\u00a0\u00bb* **This only demonstrates a statistical correlation between presence of HPV and cancer,** **without anyone being so far able to demonstrate a direct CAUSALITY link**\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n\u00ab\u00a0*There  are effective HPV vaccines. Current vaccines offer effective  vaccination against 70% of carcinogenic HPV, and a new vaccine will soon  increase this rate to 90%.\u00a0\u00bb* **But**, **what is meant by \"efficacy\"**? **The  vaccine is effective on the infections of strains targeted by the   vaccine (only 4 to 9 of the nearly 200 listed strains) but** **there is no evidence that it can prevent invasive cancer let alone avoid death by this cancer**\\*\\*.\\*\\*\n\n***\u00ab*** *In Australia, where 80% of women and 75% of men are vaccinated, cases of HPV lesions have almost disappeared\u00a0\u00bb.* **This statement is outrageous, as the following presentation will show you, because in this highly vaccinated country** **the number of cervical cancers (and other cancers attributed to HPV) continue to increase.**\n\nThey  also deny the risk of serious side effects that have led to  protests  in many countries (Denmark, Ireland, Japan, Colombia) and legal  complaints from many  doctors.\n\n# A regular pap smear (every three years) better guarantees early detection of cervical cancer.\n\nIn  France, HPV infection is not a real public health problem in 2018,  neither for women nor for men. In women, since pap smear screening has  been used, the annual number of deaths from cervical cancer is  consistently less than 1000 in France, and the women who die are almost   exclusively those who have not been screened.\n\nDiagnosis  of HPV papillomavirus infection detected by systematic sampling should  be avoided! Positive results often lead to unnecessary  examination and  very early conisation (biopsy) which is often useless.\n\n**The &lt;1000 deaths per year from cervical cancer could all have been  prevented by screening**.\n\n**Whilst efficacy of smear screening is proven, HPV vaccination not  been proven to prevent a single invasive cervical cancer.**\n\nThe cancer registry records even suggest that this vaccine is sometimes likely to increase the risk.\n\n# INSTEAD OF REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CERVICAL CANCERS, IT CAN INCREASE IT\n\n**After  12 years of use and more than 200 million girls vaccinated worldwide  for a total bill of nearly $100 billion paid directly or  indirectly by  citizens , we can indeed draw a balance of effectiveness of vaccination  in two ways:**\n\n1 \u00b0) By examining  the evolution of the incidence (annual frequency of new cases per  100,000 women) of the invasive cancer of the cervix in each country,  before and after vaccination, a method already validated in 2003.\n\n2  \u00b0) World Standardised Rates: gross Incidence reported as \u00ab\u00a0Standard  World Population\u00a0\u00bb to correct possible biases related to the demographic  characteristics of each\u00a0country\n\nThe  evolution of the incidence of cervical cancer before and after  vaccination with Gardasil can be traced in a perfectly reliable way in  the national cancer registries controlled and published by the  ministries of health of the concerned countries.\n\n**Australia**,  according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the  incidence  of cervical cancer declined by almost 50%, from 12(\/100,000)  in 1995 to  7 in 2004 (before the vaccination campaign). Mortality also  improved, thanks to pap smear screening and treatment. However, since  the vaccination campaign started in 2007, **there   has been no further decrease in either incidence or mortality. In  2017, the incidence of cervical cancer is estimated at 7.1 and cervical  cancer mortality has increased by almost 15% from 1.7 in 2014 to 2 in   2017**.\n\nThe Australian Ministry of  Health estimates the number of new cases of cervical cancer is 912 in  2017 and 930 in 2018. Claiming that \u00ab\u00a0cases of HPV lesions have almost  disappeared\u00a0\u00bb in Australia is therefore not correct.\u00a0 One cannot imagine  that these MPs lie  voluntarily, so we can conclude that they are  poorly informed and that they should have checked themselves the  information provided by the  experts related to laboratories before  distributing this \u00ab\u00a0fake news \u00bb.\n\n**Great Britain**,  according to Cancer Research  UK, the Office of National Statistics  (ONS), the incidence of cervical  cancer had decreased (thanks to pap  smear screening) from 12.4 in 1995 to 9.27 in 2004. But **since  vaccination, there is no evidence of improvement, nor on the incidence  stagnating from 9.3 in  2006 to 9.6 in 2015 nor on the mortality  remaining at 3**.\n\n**Canada**.  According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the incidence of cervical  cancer has decreased (through  screening) from 18 in 1972 to 8.1 in  2008. But **since vaccination, there has been no further progress on incidence stagnating at 8.3 in 2017**.\n\n**United States**,  according to the National Cancer Institute\u2019s SEER cancer statistics  review, the incidence of cervical cancer reduced from 14.8 in 1975 to  6.66 in 2007. But **since vaccination, there has been no decrease in the incidence of cervical cancer reached 6.68 in 2015** .\n\n**Norway**,  according to the Cancer Registry of  Norway, Oslo: before vaccination,  the standardized incidence had fallen sharply thanks to smear screening  from 24 in 1965 to 7 in 2004. But **since the vaccination, it has gone up to 13.9 in 2014 and 14.9 in 2015.**\n\n**Sweden**,  according to the National Kvalitetsregister for Cervix Cancer  prevention (NKCx ): before the vaccination campaign, the incidence of  cervical cancer had decreased (thanks to screening) from 18 in 1967 to 7  in 2006. **The  worldwide standardized  incidence of cervical cancer has increased significantly since  vaccination rising to 10.3 in 2012 and 11.5 in 2015.  This increase is  almost exclusively due to the increase in the  incidence of invasive  cancer among women aged 23 to 49, which has reached more than 50% since  2006 (11 in 2006 versus 17 in 2015), whereas it is those who have the  highest vaccination coverage rate (85%).**\n\nThus,  in countries whose populations have access to pap smear screening, it  has led to a considerable reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer  (from 40 to 60%). In contrast, the introduction of vaccination has not  reduced the incidence or mortality of cervical cancer. Contrary to what  is promised by laboratory-related physicians and by many global health  authorities, vaccination campaigns have even been followed by an  increase in the incidence of cancer.\n\n**France**,  with low levels of HPV vaccination,  can serve as a control country.  According to Public Health France, the  incidence of cervical cancer in  mainland France has steadily decreased from 15 in 1995 to 7.5 in 2007,  6.7 in 2012 and 6 in 2017. This decrease in incidence was accompanied by  a decrease in mortality from 5 in 1980 to 1.8 in 2012 and 1.7 in 2017. **France,  with low use of Gardasil, has a much more satisfactory evolution for  both incidence and mortality than that of the countries cited as  examples for those who want to impose compulsory vaccination.**\n\n**Comparison of recent standardized incidences with vaccination coverage rates.**\n\nImmunization  advocates claim that a high vaccination coverage rate reduces the risk  of invasive cancer of the cervix. Yet the comparison of incidence and  mortality rates with vaccine coverage rates shows the opposite:\n\n**Australia**, HPV vaccination coverage exceeds 85% , but in 2017 the incidence of cervical cancer is 7 and the mortality is 2\n\n**Great Britain**, despite vaccination coverage exceeding 80%, the incidence in 2015 was 9.6 and mortality 3\n\n**Sweden** the vaccination coverage rate is close to 75% but the incidence 2015 reaches 11.5.\n\n**USA**, in 2017 the vaccination coverage rate is 60% for a cervical cancer incidence of 6.8 and a specific mortality at 2.3.\n\n**France**  , in 2017, HPV vaccination coverage is  very low (around 15% ) for a  cervical cancer incidence of 6 and a specific mortality of 1.7\n\n**In  countries with high immunization coverage, the incidence of invasive  cancers and mortality are therefore higher than in France.**\n\n**The harmful side-effects are difficult to deny**\n\nJapan,  Austria and Denmark have stopped promoting this vaccination after  serious complications, sometimes even fatal and that families suffering  from these vaccines  organized public demonstrations in several  countries of the world  (Japan, Colombia, Ireland).  Danish doctors  lodged a complaint against the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which  refused to answer their questions, after the notification of severe  neurological events not listed in the EMA registers.\n\nIn France, several lawsuits are in progress.\n\n\u00ab\u00a0Among  the most frequently mentioned by the victims defended by M  pathologies  e Coubris include multiple sclerosis, lupus, disseminated  acute  encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the central nervous system) and  myofasciitis macrophages (a disease that results in pain muscle and   chronic fatigue)\u00a0\u00bb. A parliamentary commission of inquiry which could   hear experts, citizens and independent associations of laboratories,  having, from near or far, no link of interest with laboratories, would   be a first step to enlighten Parliament.\n\n**IN CONCLUSION, the benefit-risk balance is not in favor of vaccination, let alone compulsory.**\n\nA  compulsory health measure should not be based on faith in vaccination  or hidden conflicts of interest, but on proven facts, verifiable by  every citizen. However, **the facts  established by the official records of cancer registries show that HPV  vaccination does not  protect against invasive cancer of the cervix but  seems rather to  maintain its frequency at a high level, and sometimes  even increase it.**\n\nEdited from [here](https:\/\/www.agoravox.fr\/tribune-libre\/article\/gardasil-alerte-risque-imminent-d-206314#_ftnref25)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Gardasil : the anticancer vaccination that increases the risk of cervical cancer in young women"}

NOVEL! OMG OMG OMG FREAKOUT?!)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo you ask: How does it all work? The Fed can reduce aggregate demand by raising either short term or long term interest rates (4). However, this dampens inflation expectations and prevents long term interest rates from rising (5). Therefore I propose letting short-term interest rates stay below the neutral rate for a while.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut David, wouldn't this lead to extreme inflation???\n\nA: I don't think so! Long term interest rates will adjust upwards alongside higher inflation expectations (5). While this won't stop rising inflation I believe it is a strong self-corrective mechanism - especially if long term interest rates are below the neutral curve (6, 7). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo emphasize why I think this is the best course of action lets dive into scenarios we will be making this assumption:\n\n8: All interest rates are below the neutral curve \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nScenario 1: The Fed Raises Interest Rates\n\nRaising short-term interest rates while long term interest rates are still accommodative (below neutral) will prevent long term interest rates from rising (5 - via inflation expectations). This means that long term interest rates will be accomodative, and short term interest rates will be contractionary. Because the two effects end up fighting each other, the Fed is forced to raise short term interest rates even further as they are ineffective in fighting inflation.  This leads to a flat yield curve and recession (BOOM! We figured it out boys!). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1a: Raising rates but too slowly\n\nBoth the long term rates and short term rates will rise at the same time, making a dangerous combo attack against aggregate demand\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1b: Raising rates but too quickly\n\nScenario 1 happens but much sooner\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSO. If you're still reading at this point: You're a champion\n\nEvery theory would be incomplete without the SPECIAL SAUCE: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Fed needs to get interest rates away from the Zero-Lower Bound (ZLB). But! Remember this now includes both the short and long term rates (7). We end up in these scenarios above\n\n1a: Short term rates away from ZLB, long term rates maintain low\n\n1b: Short term rates away from ZLB, long term rates even lower\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis means in the next recession we will be extremely limited on monetary policy tools - as QE will not be as effective as last time! (Due to ZLB limits on long term rates)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe only way to ensure rates move away from the Zero Lower Curve is to first raise long term rates above neutral, and then raise short term rates to get the yield curve to equal the neutral yield curve.

I've started to notice, however, that it doesn't seem like that is what people care most about here. Instead, it seems like people just want to hold people responsible for things that they've done, that they personally don't like, morally disagree with, or think were stupid. Now, that sounds all well and good on the face of it, until the \"punishments\" that people want to doll out or outcomes that they would like to see actualized infringe on the freedom of the decision maker. Moreover, I've noticed that people seem to care more about responsibility and punishment than freedom when they disagree with the thing someone did. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI first noticed this a few months ago when I was talking about the Cambridge Analytica stuff with folks. I wanted to know how libertarians felt about a private company and a political candidate manipulating the public and violating their privacy, a clear violation of their freedom. The response I got was that these people were dumb for sharing their information, and therefore are responsible for it - not that it's fucked up what CA and Trump did and that we need to do more to protect our privacy and freedom (the response I'd expect from someone who truly cares about freedom above all else). I noticed it again talking to people about abortion. Instead of defending a woman's freedom to choose what to do with her body (again what I'd think someone who truly values freedom above all else would do), people thought that she should have to go through the pregnancy because it was her choice to get pregnant - and yes, before you ask, they thought abortion was morally wrong. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy main point, that I'm sure I'm going to get crucified for, is that I don't think a lot of people here really care about freedom for freedom's sake. They care about holding people responsible for things they disagree with, and punishing them for it. Because of this, they act like they care about freedom for freedom's sake, when it's really just a convenient belief to have when you want to blame people for shit you don't like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: I am sure that not everyone here is guilty of this.

{"author":"Pariahdog119","created_utc":1536573641,"num_comments":5,"score":7,"selftext":"What is justice?\n\nThis question is important, because the goal of a system of justice is dependent on what we mean when we say \"justice.\" Do we mean punishment? Vengeance? If so, then the current American system of justice is perfectly fine, and nothing I have to say here is of any value whatsoever.\n\nI don't think that's true, though. I think that justice (defined as \"morally right and fair behavior or treatment\") often has very little to do with the system of criminal courts and incarceration in the United States. As Libertarians, we already have a standard for \"morally right and fair:\" Don't hurt people. Don't take their stuff. A just system, then, would be one which protects people from being hurt and having their stuff taken.\n\nThis can be accomplished by putting everyone in a bubble suit in a locked room. Now they're safe!\n\nObviously that's not the goal. A system which limits the liberty of the people whose liberty it is meant to protect is not a very well-designed system. What, then, should this system do, to protect the life, liberty, and property of the people?\u00a0\n\nThere are five recognized purposes of a system of criminal punishment: Deterrence, retribution,\u00a0 rehabilitation, incapacitation, and restitution. Let's examine them each in turn.\n\nDeterrence is the idea that by imposing harsh penalties for crime, potential criminals will be dissuaded from\u00a0 committing crimes for fear of the punishment this will incur. This is a popular refrain among conservatives who favor harsher sentences. However, there is one glaring problem with this theory: It doesn't work. Even the government admits this; the National Institute for Justice, the research branch of the Department of Justice,\u00a0points out\u00a0that prison sentences, harsher penalties, and even the risk of execution do not deter crime. Criminals don't often weigh the possible punishments should they be caught; instead, they weigh how likely they are to be caught. The only effective deterrence is a visible police presence that affects this perception. To impose cruel and unusual punishments in the hope - especially the vain hope - that it will somehow dissuade others from criminal acts seems to me to be completely unrelated to the idea of justice.\n\nRetribution is the familiar \"eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth\" Old Testament theory of justice. A thief must be stolen from; a murderer must be murdered; a rapist must be raped. The object is to expiate the guilt of the offender by imposing on them the same suffering they imposed on their victim. There is one immediate objection I have to this idea; it is that harming someone does nothing to make whole the harm that another has suffered. To libertarians, who hold that force must only be used in defense, the idea of intentionally using force in this manner must be particularly onerous, in the same manner as torture. In preventing harm, one may use as much force as is required; this is defense. To use force afterwards, because of anger, is not defense.\n\nRehabilitation is the idea that offenders can be induced to change their behavior through various methods. There is one notable difference between rehabilitative punishment and deterrent or retributive punishment: It can be proven to work. In fact, the components of successful rehabilitation programs can be measured, and the results used to improve future iterations. Rehabilitation is effective at reducing recidivism. However, there is a flaw in a system which focuses solely on rehabilitation: The system cannot rehabilitate an offender who does not wish to be rehabilitated. And so a rehabilitation-focused system of punishment must either release unrehabilitated offenders when their sentence has expired, or detain them indefinitely until it is satisfied that they have been rehabilitated. We can see the results of the second in California with indefinite civil commitment, a system in which offenders who have completed their sentence are simply moved to another facility from which they are never released.\n\nIncapacitation is the idea that repeat offenders should be incarcerated for long periods of time in order to prevent them from offending again. On its face, it seems like a great idea - we'll be removing career offenders from the public, which will reduce crime! In action, what happens is varying definitions of\u00a0 \"repeat offenders\" - such as the notorious three-strikes law, which can impose life sentences for nonviolent or low-level crimes.\u00a0\n\nRestitution is related to the Biblical concept of retribution, with one important difference: In retribution, both the victim and the offender are harmed. In restitution, the offender makes whole the victim. This satisfies pretty much every definition of justice, and is, in my opinion, the best option when it is feasable.\n\nBut what about when it isn't? What if the offender cannot afford restitution? What if the victim cannot be made whole, as in cases of rape, murder, or grievous assault?\n\nThat is where we must look to the other four methods. The first two I reject out of hand; deterrence because it is ineffective, and retribution because it violates the liberty principle to use force only in defense. Rehabilitation is possible for those who are willing to change their behavior, but there will always be those who refuse, who perhaps do not even admit that their actions are harmful. Incapacitation works only insofar as the person who harms another must be prevented from doing so again, and not as a predictor of future harm - there are too many people incarcerated right now for repeated crimes of poverty under this idea.\n\nWhen we list the basic human rights of life, liberty, and property, we list them in this order not only in mere imitation of Thomas Jefferson, but because this is the order in which we value them. And when a person must be deprived of their rights in order to protect the rights of another, this order again comes into play; we do not deprive an individual of his life because he deprived someone of their property. Theft is not a capital crime. And so we should apply this same hierarchy to the theory of criminal justice.\n\nAn offender who violates a person's right to property may rightly be liable to have his own right to property curtailed to make whole the victim: a thief may be required to repay what he has stolen. This is restitution, and it should be the default response to nearly all property crime.\n\nAn offender who violates a person's right to liberty or who threatens their life may rightly have their own liberty curtailed to prevent them from victimizing another: kidnappers, rapists, violent assaulters, and murderers may be incarcerated to prevent them from harming people. In these cases, often no restitution is possible.\n\nHowever, the purpose of the incarceration should not be retribution. It should not be deterrence. It should be to prevent the offender from harming others. To this end, the offender should be incarcerated only so long as they are a risk to the public. The violent young man who \"ages out\" of his tendency for violence after the age of 25, the old man who is crippled and no longer capable of it - neither of these should be incarcerated.\n\nTo incarcerate someone who poses no threat to the public is not justice or liberty. Only those who can be proven a threat should be incarcerated. This is the purpose of the sentencing phase of the criminal trial; after guilt or innocence has been determined, the proper treatment should be determined. Too often the sentencing phase is merely a formality, where a prosecutor argues for longer sentences and the defense argues for shorter sentences, which are imposed by a judge with little to no regard for the actual safety of the public, but rather to sate their desire for vengeance. And that is injustice.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"First Principles of Justice"}

See: Venezuela right now.\n\nA much more practical and workable solution to the socialist's goal, which is really just to \"help the poor\" in most cases, is to support welfare capitalism.\n\nIn other words: let the markets be free and unregulated, but tax the incomes at the top to give free money to the poor, so that they can buy what they need to survive from the free market.\n\nIn this system, the economy is not maximally efficient, but when set up carefully, it still allows for sustainable economic growth, which actually means that more real dollars are available for redistribution to the poor in the long run. This allows everyone to get richer over time.\n\nThis is what America currently does, and what the oft-praised Nordic countries do. For the most part, anyways. And it works.\n\nSure, some current systems are unsustainable such as USA's Social Security, but with a few adjustments to tax revenue and payouts, the system could achieve sustainability.\n\nSocialists would receive way, way more support for their movement to help the poor if they simply defined their version of socialism as \"tax the rich, pay the poor, and leave the markets alone\" rather than \"use government to run corporations\" which, as we can see from history, *almost always* results in catastrophic failure in the economy due to various reasons that economists have explained for decades (eg the \"local knowledge problem\").","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Socialists would receive a lot more agreement if they just advocated for welfare capitalism instead of socialism"}

Since putting humans to supervise the huge amounts of pictures, sound, videos and text that gets uploaded everywhere is impossible, such supervision would be done mostly by automated computer programs. This law has massive harmful ramifications worldwide, similar to the old SOPA law.\n\nThere are better alternatives to this law, such as (this), so there's no reason at all for this law to pass.\n\nAnd here's why it shouldn't:\n\n1: Destruction of Innovation: \nOriginal creators will get censored by the massive amounts of false-positives. This prevents their propagation and also harms completely legal fan works under fair-use.\nAbout the false-positives: https:\/\/www.techdirt.com\/articles\/20180708\/01252940196\/numerical-exploration-how-eus-article-13-will-lead-to-massive-censorship.shtml\n\n2: Oppression and Abuse of Power:\nMost if not all internet traffic will be monitored, putting a de-facto end to all privacy, destroying activism and preventing the world from becoming a better place. You can never report issues anonimously.\nThe filters also can definitely be tampered with, with or without new legislation or the population's knowledge, to exclude any content that is inconvenient to corrupt authorities. It can also prevent the propagation of ideas that harm the status quo, thus creating an overly obedient population that accepts oppression and misery.\nPutting it all together, any causes of suffering like world hunger, mass unemployment, disease and crime can be easily be swept under the rug, unseen and unsolved.\nRemember that this law exists solely because of the corporate lobbying that corrupts and destroys democracy. This is just the beginning.\nAbout the EU lobbying: https:\/\/corporateeurope.org\/lobbyplanet\n\n3: Smashing of the Lower Classes:\nSuch a system would be difficult and expensive to set up, harming small internet business as a whole and giving an undue advantage to bigger corporations. This is greatly augmented for creatives due to the false-positives.\nSmall business is the true soul of the economy, it is where economic competition comes from. An economy where big corporations rule the market without the competition of the small ones leads to poor products, poor wages, unemployment and hunger.\nAbout the importance of small business: https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/entry\/why-are-small-businesses-so-important-for-the-economy_us_58f61f9ae4b048372700db75\n\n\n\nNot in Europe? It Still Affects You: \nWhile many businesses will initially block Europe to avoid the filter, they will eventually try to permeate the european market. Since adapting your current product is easier than creating another one, many companies will censor their own content to make it pass the filter.\nThat means you, outside of Europe, will receive content filtered by Europe's authoritarianism. \n\n\n\n\nWhat You Can Do:\nRaise noise. The more people know about this, the more the members of the Parliament will be afraid of not being reelected later.\nSpread this text everywhere, here's the link: https:\/\/telegra.ph\/Against-Article-13-09-12-2\nSend people to https:\/\/saveyourinternet.eu or https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/article-13-europes-hotly-debated-eu-copyright-law-explained\/\nSpread the info to any group involved in politics, any celebrity on twitter, anything. Translate this text to one of the many non-english languages of Europe, or ask someone else to do it.\n\nIf you believe the internet will be sufficiently decentralized at some point, please remember we must delay authoritarianism while the tech and infrastructure is not fully mature.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Fight Against Censorship"}

{"author":"PonyDev","created_utc":1536739571,"num_comments":5,"score":41,"selftext":"A 33-year-old blogger and member of Russia\u2019s Libertarian Party, Mikhail Svetov hosts a\u00a0YouTube channel\u00a0where he discusses libertarian ideas with guests, including oppositionist Ildar Dadin, Barnaul resident Maria Motuznaya (now on trial for sharing supposedly extremist online memes), former Yekaterinburg Mayor Evgeny Roizman, and former Deputy Energy Minister Vladimir Milov. At the time of this writing, Svetov\u2019s YouTube channel has amassed more than 102,100 subscribers and 7.1 million views.\n\nOn Sunday, September 9, Svetov joined a protest in St. Petersburg promoted by anti-corruption activist Alexey Navalny against the government\u2019s plan to raise Russia\u2019s retirement age. City officials initially granted and later withdrew a rally permit, claiming that a burst water pipe made the original venue unsafe for a mass protest. Several thousand people turned out, nonetheless, and police ultimately detained more than 450 demonstrators.\n\nOn Sunday, Svetov appeared on Alexey Navalny\u2019s live YouTube broadcast and \u201clive tweeted\u201d photos from on the ground in St. Petersburg. At 6 p.m., two police officers\u00a0grabbed Svetov\u00a0and escorted him into a police van, charging him with the\u00a0misdemeanor offense\u00a0of violating regulations on public assemblies.\n\nSvetov spent the night in jail. On Monday, September 10, his case went before St. Petersburg\u2019s Kirov District Court, which returned his mobile phone during the hearing, allowing him to\u00a0live-tweet\u00a0his own trial. The judge refused to let him or his lawyer call any witnesses, and his attorney was given just five minutes to read over the case materials.\n\nSvetov was ultimately sentenced to 10 days in jail \u2014 twice as long as the punishment for Anastasia Orlova, the activist who actually organized the protest in St. Petersburg. The aggravating circumstance in Svetov\u2019s case was an unpaid 2,000-ruble ($30) fine imposed in June 2018 for supposedly displaying Nazi symbols in public in Moscow in June 2017 at 25 Polikarpova Street. Svetov denies any knowledge of this case, saying he hadn\u2019t heard about the conviction, the fine, or the address in question until his hearing on Monday.\n\nSpeaking in court, Svetov suggested that the case might have been launched in May 2018, after he helped organize a\u00a0demonstration\u00a0in Moscow on April 30, 2018, in support of Internet freedom and the censored instant messenger Telegram. Twitter users were quick to point out that one of Svetov\u2019s YouTube videos does in fact partially show a swastika, but the video was posted well after June 2017, when he supposedly broke the law.\n\nLibertarian Party spokesperson \u201cSonya Blade\u201d tweeted a\u00a0screenshot\u00a0from the St. Petersburg public database of administrative offenses, showing that the records for the \u201cSwastika incident\u201d don\u2019t match Mikhail Svetov\u2019s patronymic or home address.\n\n\u201cI wish I knew what\u2019s actually at this address,\u201d Mikhail Svetov managed to\u00a0tweet\u00a0from court, before the judge ordered his arrest and confiscated his phone once again.\n\nhttps:\/\/amp.meduza.io\/en\/feature\/2018\/09\/10\/russian-libertarian-activist-is-jailed-for-10-days-over-a-fascist-offense-he-says-he-didn-t-commit?__twitter_impression=true","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Russian libertarian activist is jailed for 10 days over a \u2018fascist offense\u2019 he says he didn't commit"}

The loads of debris are worth thousands of dollars. I know some companies that were making close to a million a month of FEMA money with just a handful of trucks. When I was in the california fires i met countless truck drivers who made 50$\/hr driving for 12 hours and only delivering 1 load ! 1 load. The workers who picked up the fire debris were making 50$hr had to where 100's of dollars of 'disposable' EPA approved hazmat suits. If they had to go pee they had to throw it all away and put on a new suit. All this for tiny traces of asbestos in some houses. They probably worked a solid 1 hour a day. Maybe 2.

I'm not going to claim that you need to abandon these arguments altogether, but if the result of pointing out some of these problems with your argumentation lead to better discourse on the subject then so be it.\n\n\n#INTRO#\n\nThe idea of this post is to lay bare many of the myths surrounding the topic of inequality and to arm the members of the Liberty movement with hard data, facts, and rebuttals. Although I endeavored to address as many as I could think of, we cannot think that all topics will be covered because the human imagination is fertile ground for fallacies. As one fallacy is being argued against in the real world, many others are sprouting forth in the minds of people impervious to facts. \n\nThere is inevitably a lot of overlap between these different fallacies and so there will be some overlap of sources used to rebut them. These fallacies often share many themes, misrepresentations, and logical breakdowns. It is for this reason I must use some of the same data sources between fallacies. \n\nAgain, inevitably I may not be able to cover all topics, and I encourage knowledgeable users to contribute to the discussion in the comments section in the same style (meaning using as much hard data as possible). Without further ado.\n ----------------\n\n#Myth 1#\n\n#Incomes have fallen or stagnated#\n\n\nThis is a common myth bandied about by people on Reddit, the media, and just about everywhere. This myth *may* have arisen from data showing that the average household income has more or less stayed the same over the long term as shown in this chart.\n\nhttps:\/\/research.stlouisfed.org\/fred2\/series\/MEHOINUSA672N\n\n\nThe problem with household data however is that the number of people *per household* does not stay the same overtime. In fact the number of people per household isn't the same between ethnic groups either (see below in race inequality). \n\nhttp:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/183648\/average-size-of-households-in-the-us\/\n\nAs you can see from the link above, the number of people per household has changed overtime so that there were more people per household in the past than in the present. The problem that this brings up is that if household income is steady, but people per household drops, then that is actually an increase in income *per person*\n\nEG: \n\nHousehold 1\n\n    3 people\n    income for the entire household put together is 60,000\n    average income per person in household is 20,000\n\nHousehold 2\n\n    2 people in household\n    total household income put together is 60,000\n    income per person is????!!!! 30,000\n\nGoing from 20,000 per person -----&gt; 30,000 per person is a\n\n50% increase, not stagnation.\n\n\nSo *almost* any time household statistics are brought up we can dismiss it as nothing more than a statistical gimmick used to score cheap political points.\n\n\nThe preferred method should be to use Per capita data, because per capita means one person *and it always means one person*. In other words a variable is held constant, and this means it is scientifically superior to something like a household income statistic for measuring living standards.\n\nAnd just what does the per capita data say?\n\n\nCheck for yourself.\n\nReal gross domestic product per capita\n\nhttps:\/\/research.stlouisfed.org\/fred2\/series\/A939RX0Q048SBEA\n\nReal disposable personal income per capita\n\nhttps:\/\/research.stlouisfed.org\/fred2\/series\/A229RX0A048NBEA\n\nReal personal consumption expenditures per capita\n\nhttps:\/\/research.stlouisfed.org\/fred2\/series\/A794RX0Q048SBEA\n\nReal total compensation per hour (total compensation = wages + nonwage benefits like healthcare, workmans comp, holidays etc)\n\nhttps:\/\/research.stlouisfed.org\/fred2\/series\/COMPRNFB\n\n\nAs you can see, there is a universal increase across the board overtime in these data series, business cycles notwithstanding. (In case you're wondering the \"real\" in real per capita means it is adjusted for inflation).\n\n-----\n\n#Myth 2#\n\n# The share of the income going to the higher income groups has grown faster than the bottom income groups exacerbating things like the Gini coefficient#\n\nThis isn't so much an outright fallacy as it has to do with incomplete knowledge and misunderstanding of statistics. There are two basic problems with this. The argument falls apart when you take into account the following:\n\n1. Income mobility (ie ability to move between income groups)\n\n2. All households saw increases\n\n\nThe data that backs me up comes from something called the *Panel Study of Income Dynamics* at the university of Michigan (one of the higher ranked econ schools). The PSID data is quite literally the worlds longest running longitudinal study and surveys in the world. It started in 1968 and has been ongoing ever since.\n\nhttps:\/\/psidonline.isr.umich.edu\/\n\n\nThe reason this data is important is because it follows *people over time* instead of statistical bins. This is maybe at first a subtle point, but it is crucial. Many of the pitfalls of inequality arguments is that they compare *statistical bins* instead of people overtime. The problem with this is that who makes up the income groups changes over time. I will now link to an easy to digest video that explains the PSID data very well. Again, the inequality argument falls apart when income mobility comes into the picture. It also falls apart when the data shows that *all households* saw increases in income.\n\nVideo\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vDhcqua3_W8\n\nData showing all households gaining. Table 2 page 8\n\nhttps:\/\/psidonline.isr.umich.edu\/publications\/Papers\/tsp\/2010-01_comparing_estimates_of_fam.pdf\n\n\nLastly, another problem with this kind of argumentation from the left is that it assumes that inequality is a bad thing in the first place. This is not so. Take for example that as people age they gain in productivity, experience, skills, networking, raises, education, may start a business, invest and so on...So that inequality is in major part simply a function of the accrual of economic benefits to people as they age. Another reason for inequality can be geography. Different regions of the earth (and indeed different regions of even the same country) can be endowed with different resources, access to transportation (like the sea), navigable waterways, temperate weather, arable land and so on so that there is no reason at all to expect that people born in different areas should expect similar outcomes. Another reason may also simply come down to choices and endowment of natural talents. Not all people are equally skilled at all tasks, nor are all people equally interested in all tasks. Some may be interested in playing music...and posses a natural ability to do so, while other may be more mathematically inclined for example. There is no reason whatsoever to believe that The mathematician and the musician should experience the same economic outcomes, nor should they. \n\nInequality in fact may also have positive benefits (link)\n\nhttps:\/\/www.stlouisfed.org\/publications\/inside-the-vault\/spring-2010\/us-income-inequality-its-not-so-bad\n\n-----\n\n#Myth 3#\n\n#Wages have not tracked productivity#\n\nThis is another example of class warfare based on half truths and misrepresentation of data. You may have seen this chart out there in the wilderness.\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/FVc4xKa\n\nThe problem with this chart is how misleading it is. This chart only takes into account *wages*. When taking into account TOTAL COMPENSATION, which is wages + nonwage benefits (again meaning things like healthcare, workman's comp, maternity leave etc) then part of this discrepancy disappears.\n\n\nHeritage does a pretty good job of going over the much more complicated story of productivity and wages\/total compensation. Depending on what inflation measure you use, you come to wildly different conclusions. Since CPI is from a consumer standpoint, it doesn't make a lot of sense to use in the factors market and a more appropriate measure of inflation, like IPD measures which do a lot better job of capturing factors market inflation. Here is the link which explains the situation better and in more depth. Essentially when you use a more appropriate measure of inflation and take into account non wage benefits employees are receiving then compensation has tracked productivity quite well. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.heritage.org\/research\/reports\/2013\/07\/productivity-and-compensation-growing-together\n\n\n------\n\n#Myth 4#\n\n#But average mean nothing, what about median?#\n\n\nThis inevitably comes up when linking to the Fed data in Myth 1. Essentially they argue that averages may not capture what is happening throughout the distribution curve. Ok, I can see that. The problem with this line of reasoning is that the PSID data I showed earlier shows that *all households* have seen an increase in income. And again it doesn't take into account income mobility. This is a repost of some sources (hey I said it would happen) I already used, but they are again relevant.\n\nVideo\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vDhcqua3_W8\n\nData showing all households gaining. Table 2 page 8\n\nhttps:\/\/psidonline.isr.umich.edu\/publications\/Papers\/tsp\/2010-01_comparing_estimates_of_fam.pdf\n\n-------\n\n\n#Myth 5#\n\n\n# Millions of people are starving, what about the third world!? Capitalism is based on exploitation, just look at sweatshops!#\n\n\nThis is simply a statement based on literally nothing. Quite literally no data backs this assertion up whatsoever. If this were true in any way, then we should see increases in world poverty for example. But thats not what happened. In fact World Poverty is *down* over the last few decades and in no small part thanks to free markets, trade, and capitalism.\n\nThis video is based on data from the World Bank\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JzmxQOonnGE\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I can have a moment of brevity with my audience here. You would think that hearing this news would delight those who ...supposedly... care about the poor and working class so much. Instead what I've found is that this often elicits extreme reactions in many people. I've learned that this usually evokes a strong defensive reaction where people will attack the source of the statistics or the stats themselves, and this comes from people who allegedly care about the poor.\n\n-------\n\n\n\n#Myth 6#\n\n\n# CEO's make 300+ times more than the average worker!#\n\n\n\nThis one is a serious facepalm for me. I tutored statistics (and economics) at my university, and while I can understand where the misconceptions on some other statistics here come from, in this particular issue it is quite literally an intro statistics problem. The problem with this assertion is that it is taken from a *non-representative* sample of CEO's, usually taken to be the Fortune 500, or the top 100 earning CEO's. This is akin to wanting to know about the typical University student and taking a survey at Harvard or Yale. Instead what we find is that the typical CEO actually makes closer to 183,000 a year, which is about 4-7 times the average worker (see: not 300+) and is still a lot for sure, but not the hysterical amount cited in the media and often time reddit. \n\nSource BLS data\n\nhttp:\/\/www.bls.gov\/oes\/current\/oes111011.htm\n\n\n--------\n\n\n#Myth 7#\n\n\n# Gender inequality, women make ~73 cents on the dollar compared to men#\n\n\nThis myth has its origins in...again... a statistical misunderstanding. Data at the BLS shows that if you take the total income made by women and divide by the number of women...and do the same for the men.... you come to the conclusion the women do indeed make less than men. The problem with this is that it doesn't take into account numerous factors that impact wages that have nothing to do with discrimination. I would add that even though women are making less money (at first glance) we cannot automatically assume that they are worse off on net balance, as you will see.\n\n\nThese difference come down to the following: Different choices\n\n\n* Different choices: Women are more likely to take part time work and Choose lower paying fields and degrees. They are more likely to take time off work (and miss raises and experience) usually to spend time with family and kids.\n\n\nsources:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2015\/10\/01\/women-more-than-men-adjust-their-careers-for-family-life\/\n\nhttp:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/money\/2013\/09\/11\/220748057\/why-women-like-me-choose-lower-paying-jobs\n\nhttp:\/\/www.pewsocialtrends.org\/2013\/12\/11\/on-pay-gap-millennial-women-near-parity-for-now\/sdt-gender-and-work-12-2013-1-05\/\n\n\n\nAs it turns out women tend to make a lot of choices that make economic and social sense to them, and for this reason we cannot assume that they are worse of on net balance, even though the original BLS data might seem to say so.\n\n\n----------\n\n\n# Myth 8#\n\n\n# Horrendous racial inequality exists in the United States#\n\nThis argument holds some similar features with the previous myth, but has many other issues. \n\nLeaving aside the part where Asians actually exceed white income in the United States, we have the following.\n\n\nThe first problem with this argument is that there are differences in ages between racial\/ethnic groups in the United States. Even if all other relevant factors were the same (they're not), the age difference would show inequality. Essentially those ethnic groups with older ages would have higher income, because as we've already established, older workers tend to accrue more experience, skills, investments, networking, education and so on than younger workers. \n\nSource for age discrepancy ( I couldn't find the Census data, so I used Pew instead)\n\nhttp:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/daily-number\/median-age-for-hispanics-is-lower-than-median-age-for-total-u-s-population\/\n\nAnother problem with this argument is that it fails to understand that the different races\/ethnicity in the united states are not distributed evenly, but instead have unique geographical distributions. And as we've already established, Geography plays a large role in the economics development of a region and its denizens.\n\n\nThere are more blacks in the south for example (which is poorer for all groups, including whites)\n\nhttps:\/\/www.census.gov\/newsroom\/releases\/archives\/2010_census\/cb11-cn185.html\n\n\nAnother problem, like the last myth, is that there are different choices being made in different ethnic\/racial groups. Take this fact for example: Black Phd's earn substantially less than white PHd's. Here again we have a problem with the statistics being misleading. The reason for this, which is related to different choices being made, is that Blacks disproportionately *do not* get PHd's in things like the natural sciences. Instead they are much more likely to get a PHd in something like education. There are a multitude of ordinary explanations along this line that explain the majority of the difference in incomes between whites and blacks.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.jbhe.com\/news_views\/50_black_doctoraldegrees.html\n\nhttp:\/\/www.pbs.org\/newshour\/rundown\/african-americans-over-represented-among-low-paying-college-majors\/\n\n\n\nFun fact: The difference in income between Eastern Europe and Western Europe is *greater* than the difference between whites and blacks in the United States. \n\nJust as an example take the largest eastern European nation GDP per capita, Russia, and compare that to the UK.\n\nRussia: ~10,700\nUK: ~39,700\n\nNearly 4 times \n\nhttps:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=GB\n\nhttps:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=RU\n\nNow take the difference in Median income of whites and blacks in the United States\n\nWhite: ~65,000\nBlack:  ~40,000\n\nNot even twice as high\n\nIf you want to double check me, here is the link\n\nhttps:\/\/www.census.gov\/data\/tables\/time-series\/demo\/income-poverty\/cps-hinc\/hinc-01.html\n\nDownload the excel spread sheets for \"white alone\" and \"black alone\" then scroll all the way to the right in the spreadsheets.\n\n\n-----\n\n\n#Myth 9#\n\n# But what about *wealth* inequality!?#\n\nThe first problem with this argument that I've often come across is that people will often use wealth and income interchangeably. They are not interchangeable in the least bit. Let me explain. \n\nWealth is an *accrual* of (usually) income in the form of assets. More precisely wealth is actually net assets, or Assets - Liabilities (usually just debt).\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Net_worth\n\nIncome is simply a cash flow.\n\n\nSo now that we have determined the terms, we can proceed.\n\n\nThe problem with using wealth statistics is that it is a poor indicator of the standard of living (although not *completely useless*). Take for example the hypothetical of a homeless man with no assets but no liabilities, he has a wealth of zero. Now take the example of Me and my wife, who have credit card debt, a car payment, a mortgage, student loans that far exceed our total assets leading us to have negative wealth. No one in their right minds would argue that the homeless man is better off than us, and for this reason we cannot reliably use wealth as an indicator for standard of living. \n\n\nAnother problem with wealth statistics is that they do not take into account choices. Different people, even with same incomes, may choose to accrue wealth at different rates and in different assets. For example one may wisely invest their money in a 401k, while another racks up credit card debt or gambles. There is not reason to believe that people with different incomes (or even the same incomes) should have the same amounts of wealth.\n\n\n--------------\n\n# Myth 10#\n\n\n# miscellaneous arguments#\n\n\n* America has low living standards\n\n\nJust no:   \n\nHDI rankings\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index#Very_high_human_development\n\nReal gross domestic product per capita\n\nhttps:\/\/research.stlouisfed.org\/fred2\/series\/A939RX0Q048SBEA\n\nReal disposable personal income per capita\n\nhttps:\/\/research.stlouisfed.org\/fred2\/series\/A229RX0A048NBEA\n\nReal personal consumption expenditures per capita\n\nhttps:\/\/research.stlouisfed.org\/fred2\/series\/A794RX0Q048SBEA\n\nReal total compensation per hour (total compensation = wages + nonwage benefits like healthcare, workmans comp, holidays etc)\n\nhttps:\/\/research.stlouisfed.org\/fred2\/series\/COMPRNFB\n\n* We're only richer because we work more hours!\n\n\nThe problem with this line of reasoning is that it highly implies that this is a *bad* thing. In fact the opposite is true. Average hours worked declining is associated with RECESSIONS.\n\nhttps:\/\/research.stlouisfed.org\/fred2\/series\/AWHAETP\n\n* Americans constitute 5% of the world's population but consume 24% of the world's energy\n\nThis is merely a function of being richer and having a very large economy. The U.S is about 22% of the world economy, so this statistics immediately loses much of its punch based off of that. \n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Economy_of_the_United_States\n\n\nAgain, using more energy is associated with a higher standard of living, and as I've thoroughly proven that the U.S has among the highest standards of living in the world, it makes perfect sense that we would use and \"outsized\" amount of world resources. \n\n--------------\n\n\n\n#Conclusion#\n\nInequality is not some special demon that needs slaying, you do not need to look for some special villain to explain inequality. As I've shown, there are all sorts of ordinary explanations that speak for why inequality exists at all. \n\n\nFurthermore, taking into account this data, we should also conclude that inequality can be a good thing. It can indeed perform desirable functions in our economy. A rising gini coefficient merely shows that the poor can reach higher and higher levels of income over time. As I've shown from the PSID data, Todays poor are in fact tomorrows middle class and rich, and so we see that rising inequality can be a sign of good things happening to he poor and middle class. \n\n\n\nI hope that I have changed minds with this post (hopefully many). I also hope this post accomplishes its main goal to arm liberty lovers with facts and data to refute the common myths cited here. \n\n\nPlease, feel free to add to the discussion in the comments. I highly encourage knowledgeable users to add to anything I may have missed or errors I may have overlooked.\n\n\nSocialists, take all of this as an opportunity to up your game and make your arguments more bullet proof.\n\nFull disclosure, I'm an unabashed capitalist.

Now health campaigners are petitioning the EU to protect and promote citizens' right to make their own informed medical choices.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states clearly: 'Free and informed consent must be respected in the fields of medicine and biology'. To mandate vaccinations is to deny this fundamental freedom.**\n\nIn 2009 I helped organize a protest outside the Houses of Parliament.  Swine Flu was then a considered threat and there was a chance that the  WHO might enact the law to mandate vaccination of citizens during an epidemic.\n\nAs you may recall, this did not happen but many people were  concerned that vaccination could have been forced.\n\nSix million British people, mostly children, received the vaccine but tragically, [60 people in the UK](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/http:\/\/www.thesundaytimes.co.uk\/sto\/news\/uk_news\/Health\/article1382119.ece) suffered side effects, committing them to an incurable and lifelong condition (1).\n\nThey are about to receive a multi-million-pound payout from the government as compensation for their **swine flu vaccine-induced brain damage** (narcolepsy and cataplexy). \n\n# Over 800 children across Europe suffered similar damage from the swine flu vaccine but many will never  receive any compensation.\n\nMore recently there have been protests in Poland, Serbia and other  European countries where childhood vaccination is mandatory: in March in Belgrade, Serbia, and this month demonstrations are planned for the Czech Republic and Bulgaria.\n\nIn fact just under [40% of EU member countries](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/http:\/\/www.eurosurveillance.org\/images\/dynamic\/EE\/V17N22\/DAncona_tab1.jpg) have some vaccines mandated, (2) from only Polio in Belgium, to 17  doses against 10 diseases in Hungary and 22 doses against 10 diseases in Serbia (non-EU member).\n\nFor example, [parents in Belgium face jail](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/http:\/\/www.ctvnews.ca\/jail-for-belgians-who-reject-polio-shot-1.281974) if they refuse to vaccinate their children with polio. (3) In Serbia parents who refuse vaccination are fined around a month's wages or face losing their children after a court hearing.\n\n**In some countries medical exemptions to vaccination do not apply**\n\nIn some countries (Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia and others), medical or religious exemptions do not even apply. The parents there are also seeing vaccine damage but they do not even have reporting systems, let  alone a damage fund as we do in the UK. In Poland the organization [Stop NOP](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/http:\/\/www.stopnop.pl\/) is campaigning for a vaccine adverse effect reporting system (4).\n\nHere in the UK MPs are debating amendments to a 36-year-old piece of  legislation which Jackie Fletcher of JABS (Justice Awareness and Basic  Support), mother of a severely-disabled MMR victim, described as *\"grossly unfair\"* and a major factor in skewing [national statistics about vaccine safety](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/vaccine-damage-payment\/overview) (5).\n\nHer son Robert did receive a modest payout in 2010 but it took 20  years. He is now age 23 with the mental age of a 3-year-old, doubly  incontinent and can't walk, talk or feed himself. Jackie and Robert's  lives were [changed forever by the MMR](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/http:\/\/www.jabs.org.uk\/wigan-evening-post24th.html), and they are not alone. (6)\n\nIf vaccines have the potential to cause serious harm and even death,  then mandating them for every child is not only Russian Roulette but  totally unethical - all the more so as the state does not look after the injured or cover all the costs.\n\nNot only do vaccinated children risk very serious side effects but certain vaccines (e.g. the MMR and Rotovirus) [can actually cause](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18922486) the disease(s) vaccinated against as a result of live virus shedding (7) and many vaccines do not work for all recipients.\n\nMandating a procedure that may spread disease or may not 'protect'  from disease therefore needs serious re-thinking. Surely informed choice  by the main carer is the best option.\n\n**The EFVV is a forum of 20 European countries**\n\nI am part of a European group called the [European Forum for Vaccine Vigilance](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/http:\/\/www.efvv.eu\/),  EFVV (8). It was founded in 1999 by a group of French and Spanish  doctors, homeopaths and vaccine risk awareness group organisers  concerned about the number of vaccine injuries they were seeing.\n\nBy 2006, the group had expanded considerably and completed a report  containing a statistical analysis of more than 1,000 cases of injury  from six EU countries. The report was presented to the European  Parliament and a press conference was held in Brussels but little notice  was taken.\n\nEvery year we meet and can't believe the stories of fines, threats  and legal action from our neighbours in Hungary and Slovenia. This year  attendance will nearly double with representatives from at least 20  European countries at our AGM: doctors, lawyers, campaigners and  parents. Given recent trends in both the US and Europe, the main focus  will be mandatory vaccination.\n\nWe have recently [launched a petition](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/european-parliament-european-commission-council-of-the-european-union-respect-promote-and-protect-freedom-of-informed-vaccination-consent-throughout-europe) to the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of the European Union, entitled '[Respect, promote and protect freedom of informed vaccination consent throughout Europe](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/european-parliament-european-commission-council-of-the-european-union-respect-promote-and-protect-freedom-of-informed-vaccination-consent-throughout-europe)'.

And great news - just today it received its first 10,000 signatures!\n\nThe [Charter of Fundamental Rights](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/http:\/\/www.europarl.europa.eu\/charter\/pdf\/text_en.pdf) of the European Union states clearly: *\"Free and informed consent must be respected in the fields of medicine and biology\"* (10) and this is only one of many human rights documents affirming the  right to informed consent. To mandate vaccinations is to deny this fundamental freedom and as such, it is a breach of our Universal Human Rights.\n\nIn 2011, the [US Supreme Court ruled](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/http:\/\/www.supremecourt.gov\/opinions\/10pdf\/09-152.pdf) that vaccines are *\"unavoidably unsafe\"*.  (11) Under such circumstances, how can we possibly accept the risks of  compulsory vaccination? I understand the claimed Public Health issues  around high vaccination rates but Scotland has 97% vaccine uptake with  free choice, so it is clearly possible to achieve high levels of  vaccination without mandates.\n\nI am very concerned that vaccination policy may become mandatory in  the UK as it is trending in the US, Australia and in Europe. Not only  are there well documented unwanted side effects, some severe, live virus  can shed from newly vaccinated recipients during the first few weeks  and outbreaks have been started by fully vaccinated people.\n\nSo would we really want to mandate vaccination for the health of our  children? Or should we be focusing on other ways to reduce disease and  increase health? Consider the situation in the US where the greatest  number of vaccines in the developed world are given, yet they have the [highest level of child mortality](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_countries_by_infant_mortality_rate). (12) There is clearly more to health than vaccination.\n\nVaccination may have come a long way in safety since the 1800s - [but we still do not](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/http:\/\/homeoint.ru\/pdfs\/Janine.pdf) test them with benign placebo, or with a control group and we don't  test them for BSE and can't filter out the animal DNA or viruses as they  are too small. (13) Download any vaccine insert and you will see the  disclaimer they all bear, *\"This vaccine has not been tested for  carcinogenic properties ... \".*\n\n**Mandating vaccines goes against the Nuremberg Code**\n\nThe EFVV petition is however not about vaccines and their worth per  se, but about human rights. It is important to remind ourselves that all  medicine comes with serious potential harms and vaccination is no  exception.\n\nInformed choice is vital in a democracy. Mandating vaccines actually  goes against at least a dozen European ethical documents, including the [Nuremberg Code](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/http:\/\/history.nih.gov\/research\/downloads\/nuremberg.pdf). (14)\n\nPlease don't become caught up in the frenzy to remove parental rights  and mandate medicine on otherwise healthy children, as some of our  European neighbours are doing. Or removing benefits as Australia has  done. As Professor David M.  Salisbury, ex-Director of Immunisation, wrote in [the BMJ 2012](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/http:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/344\/bmj.e2435), (15)\n\n*\"Mandatory vaccination in the UK was attempted first in the 19th  century. The legislation was ineffective, discriminated in favour of  those able to use the exemptions, and was divisive; it fostered  substantial anti-vaccine sentiment and was counterproductive. Attempts  to impose compulsion today would undoubtedly be challenged in terms of  autonomy, inappropriate intrusion of the state, availability of choice,  and parental rights and responsibilities. Bolstered by access to  information, its unacceptability to the public would be likely to have  the same consequences.\"*\n\nHowever, there is a new Director of Immunisation - [Dr Andrew Pollard](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/groups\/joint-committee-on-vaccination-and-immunisation) \\- who may have a very different view.\n\nI urge you therefore not be become  desensitized to the issues around vaccine damage, long term child health  and human rights, and [sign this important petition](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/european-parliament-european-commission-council-of-the-european-union-respect-promote-and-protect-freedom-of-informed-vaccination-consent-throughout-europe).\n\n***Anna Watson*** *is co-Secretary of the* [*European Forum for Vaccine Vigilance*](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150709170911\/http:\/\/www.efvv.eu\/) *(EFVV) as well as a mother and Primary school teacher with an interest  in ethics  and patient involvement.

{"author":"johnhardline","created_utc":1537206252,"num_comments":2,"score":1,"selftext":"Hey everyone, I have been a long time Libertarian but have always struggled with the question of how to actually maintain a level of order in a voluntary society. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo big challenges seem to have always come up - it's been hard to figure out how to deal with things like crime, as well as how to keep people from finding ways to concentrate power.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe model that I have been drafting lately is that everything needs to be re-prioritised from the bottom up rather than top down. This is probably old news to a lot of you (ie, individual first, then family, then community, then town, then region, then world).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe big challenge has been figuring out how to actually get it to happen considering most people seem to have little interest in either the theory behind it or the work involved. Where I am now with it is in a process involving several steps - first, set up a social network that works a lot like Reddit but with more categories and a more detailed rating system - something that lets people not only up-vote and down-vote by relevance, but also vote on whether or not they agree with posts - this way you can strategically up-vote something you disagree with or vise versa.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next step would be to start connecting people in real life - we could all in theory talk forever on the internet but not actually do a lot about it in the physical world - what I am envisioning is that the social network runs lounges\/clubs that are formally linked with it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next step after that would be for like-minded people to start moving in to smaller towns and vying for them to have more autonomy from the state and federal systems they are parts of. Right now we do have a 'free-ish' market, but the world is full of power monopolies. I would like to see things like citizenship decided at the municipal level, with lots of open travel agreements. As far as i know, issues are best addressed at the community level - 'policing' doesn't need to be so police-ey when everyone knows each other. In today's cities, there is no cohesion or sense of community so to speak, so everyone is forced to divest power up the ladder to maintain a functional level of order.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOnce this gets going, i think it might be possible to invert the system, where there are high civil liberties, towns are autonomous, regions are governed by multilateral agreements, and the closest thing we ever get to a 'world government' is a forum that towns or regions send representatives to in order to negotiate and have discussions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo make this happen though, i think we need to find a way to sell the principles to the average person, to do this i think we need to start and organisation that runs on libertarian principles, but gives something to the public that they are hungry for - this is where the social net run clubs and lounges come into play. Right now most cities dont actually have somewhere to go where you can just meet people and talk. We need something like a church but with less hocus pocus, somewhere people can go to hang out (irl) and chat with people, maybe have a drink or snack, and maybe work out or play some sports.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would be into any critique, advice, or collaboration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn a side note, I have just started a youtube channel to talk about some of the ideas but in a way that is a lot more piece by piece - you can find it here: [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCq9r01Go83B1io2AusHR1\\_g\/](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCq9r01Go83B1io2AusHR1_g\/) It has some in depth talks and i am doing what i can to post one a day. Hopefully this doesn't come across as a shameless plug for it, I am just finding that algorithms don't really generate any exposure. Also, if the videos just plain suck, i think i can take the criticism. The channel is not meant to be a long term thing, more of a tool to get the ball rolling on the next steps.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Developing a framework to maintain order through voluntarism"}

{"author":"NotCausarius","created_utc":1537208608,"num_comments":11,"score":1,"selftext":"From Stefan Molyneaux's book Universally Preferrable Behavior: A Rational Proof of Secular Ethics.\n\n\"Clearly, the moral proposition with regard to property rights is this: either human beings have the right to own property, or they do not. Now the first \u201cproperty\u201d that must be dealt with is the body. \u201cOwnership\u201d must first and foremost consist of control over one\u2019s own body, because if that control does not exist, or is not considered valid, then the whole question of morality \u2013 let alone property \u2013 goes out the window.\n\nIf a man has no control over his body, then clearly he has no responsibility for his actions \u2013 they are not in fact \u201chis\u201d actions, but rather the actions of his body. Now, no one would rationally argue that if a man strangles another man, it is the murderous fingers that should be put on trial and punished. Clearly, the body cannot entirely control itself, but rather must be to some degree under the direction of the conscious mind.\n\nWhat this means is that a man is responsible for the actions of his body, and therefore he is responsible for the effects of those actions. A man is responsible for where he puts his penis, which is how we know that we can judge him for raping someone. He \u201cowns\u201d the actions of his body as surely as he owns his body. To say that a man is responsible for his body but not the effects of his body is to argue that a man is responsible for aiming and throwing a knife, but not for where it lands.\n\nIn cheesy horror movies, young girls seem to be particularly susceptible to demonic possession \u2013 the inevitable priest who shows up always offers to talk to the demon in charge of the girl, at which point the girl starts making a sound like Don Ho gargling with ball bearings. This ridiculous portrait is accurate in one sense though \u2013 if some other being is in full control of the girl\u2019s vocal chords, it is that being which needs to be addressed, not the girl, who has no control over her responses.\n\nThus if I say to you that I do not have control over my speech, you can ask me: who does? If I reply that no one does, then it makes about as much sense to argue with me as it does to argue with a television set, or the aforementioned boulder as it bounces down a hillside towards you car.\n\nThus the very act of controlling my body to produce speech demands the acceptance of my ability to control my speech \u2013 an implicit affirmation of my ownership over my own body.\n\nThus to reject the ownership of the body is to reject all morality, which, as we have seen above, is utterly impossible. Logically, since morality is defined as an enforceable subset of UPB, to reject morality is to say that it is universally preferable to believe that there is no such thing as universal preferences.\n\nFinally, to use one\u2019s ownership of one\u2019s own body in the form of speech to reject the notion that one can control one\u2019s own body, is a blatant and insurmountable self-contradiction.\n\nIt is in this way that any rejection of self-ownership can be utterly discarded.\"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Fundamentals of libertarian ideology, part 1: Self-ownership and property ownership."}

{"author":"livingmylifenormally","created_utc":1537253976,"num_comments":5,"score":0,"selftext":"Dear all,\n\nHow do you feel about regulated heritage properties? The reason I ask is because although I align marginally towards less government, upon researching extensively through tertiary sources for my term paper, I can not help but feel governmental regulation is needed. \n\nFirstly, by regulated, I mean properties that are under legislative acts that prevent any change\/adaption unless approved by a governmental oversight, or heritage style buildings that are legally protected from demolishing unless the user health\/safety is at risk. \n\nMy quarrel is that I believe heritage buildings are a fundamental component of the identity a place holds and that identity is very much needed to be kept. This notion itself is contentious as there is a \"move on\" approach by many, but I have found that a hybridisation of heritage buildings juxtaposed with new construction has resulted in the best outcome for both native and immigrated people in a place to identify with. It's analogised with a perfect balance, too much heritage alienates one party, two much new construction alienates the people who have historical roots. \n\nThis is important because for the home developer\/property owner, it is not beneficial economically or environmentally to recycle old buildings and maintain \"old\" heritage sites. In fact it can often make property rent prices rise above market price. This raised price plus the negligible benefit of an old building compared to new construction that would suit their needs spacial needs better, is not worth it. For the state though, it is very beneficial at least in Australia, as it brings in for us the largest form of international tourism and by proxy money, even comparatively to museum\/art galleries. \n\nBecause of this, if left to the free market which I am usually for, it often leads to demolishing of old culturally significant buildings. This leads to arguments of governmental incentives\/rewards programs which have shown to work on a local governmental scale. \n\nNormally I am all for people to do what they want on their land, it's none of my business, but heritage buildings have too much importance of identity. Given Australia's young colonial history, our buildings often have significant WW1\/2, or early settlement importance. It has been proven that removing these buildings results in de-persionalisation of younger generations who have found to look to these heritage buildings when their identity is challenged. It is also understood that these buildings provide a place meaning and belonging. If these are removed it inevitably can lead to issues. \n\nSo as you can see, I am slightly befuddled on the issue, I have put a lot of thought into it but have yet to find a definite answer.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How do you feel about regulated heritage properties?"}

Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., in a letter dated July 24.\n\n&gt; Sanai told the committee leadership that \u201cthere are persons who work for, or who have worked for, the federal judiciary who have important stories to tell about disgraced former Chief Judge Alex Kozinski, and his mentee, current United States Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. I know that there are people who wish to speak out but fear retaliation because I have been contacted by more than a half-dozen such persons since Judge Kozinski resigned in disgrace.\u201d\n\n&gt; Sanai is the California attorney who blew the whistle on Kozinski years before a series of articles in the Washington Post in December finally brought about the resignation of the former chief judge of the 9th Circuit Court over sexual harassment revelations. Sanai has long challenged the judiciary and was deemed a \u201cvexatious litigant\u201d by one trial court, an attempted designation that was overturned on appeal.\n\n...\n\n&gt; Since Kozinski\u2019s resignation, questions have been raised about what Kavanaugh knew or did about such behavior, given the close relationship between the two. Kavanaugh clerked for Kozinski in the 1990s, a post that led directly to his clerkship with Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who recommended Kavanaugh to President Donald Trump as his replacement. Kozinski and Kavanaugh remained close and both vetted prospective clerks for Kennedy.\n\n&gt;During his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh told the Judiciary Committee that he had no knowledge whatsoever of Kozinski\u2019s behavior and was stunned to learn of the misconduct allegations. \u201cWhen they became public, the first thought I had: No one should be subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace ever, including in the judiciary, especially in the judiciary,\u201d Kavanaugh said under oath during his confirmation hearing, responding to a question from Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii. \u201cWhen I heard, it was a gut punch. It was a gut punch for me. It was a gut punch for the judiciary. I was shocked, and disappointed, angry, swirl of emotions.\u201d\n\n&gt;Hirono asked him to search his records and in a written response, he backed off his certainty, saying only, \u201cI do not remember receiving inappropriate emails of a sexual nature from Judge Kozinski.\u201d\n\n&gt;Sanai told The Intercept that at least two federal employees had information to provide the committee about Kavanaugh, including one who spoke directly with Kavanaugh about it. Sanai said that he did not hold Kavanaugh responsible for Kozinski\u2019s behavior, but rather that his claim of ignorance was not credible and could be contradicted by witnesses. Kavanaugh\u2019s credibility has become a central issue in his confirmation, as he has \u201cunequivocally\u201d denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when both were in high school.","subreddit":"Keep_Track","title":"Attorney Sent Letter to Sen.

I am, however, trying to explore all other viewpoints and extend my knowledge of them so as to not be trapped in a bubble. With that being said, I have a few questions backed by honest curiosity and the desire to improve my beliefs and values. \n\n1.\tWhat is the perception of conservatism as viewed by true libertarians? In other words, what is a conservative in the eyes of a try libertarian?\n2.\tWhy, on a fundamental level, is libertarianism better than conservatism? Do you have any real world examples of your comparisons?\n3.\tCan you truly be a conservative and a libertarian? If so, would it be better to identify fully with libertarianism as opposed to conservatism and why?\n4.\tIs it a true believe that ALL taxation in every form is theft or is that more of an extreme belief? If it is a true belief, how should the government be run, assuming we aren\u2019t anarchists and want no government, without any funding?\n5.\tWith the current 2-party system both politically and somewhat culturally, do you think libertarians and conservatives can operate as allies against more leftist (not traditional liberal) values and politics?\n\nI\u2019ll probably come up with other questions as well throughout the discussion. \n\nThanks for any input! \n\nEDIT: Added a question.

There are enough mistakes of the Democrats for Republicans to criticize constructively without resorting to political smears.\n\n4.

This is the 20% deduction for small business owners. I\u2019ve said repeatedly that the Jobs Act is a tax cut, but it\u2019s not tax simplification. There\u2019s no better proof of this than the regulations the IRS recently released covering section 199A. Keep in mind that the law itself is 12 pages long. I thought that was bad enough. But the regulations are 165 pages long. The preamble to the regulations (the Treasury\u2019s overview) is 50 pages long. And that\u2019s not even the worst of it. The Treasury estimates that businesses will spend 25 million hours per year complying with section 199A. That\u2019s more than one-third the time it took GM to manufacture all the vehicles it sold in the U.S. in 2017. Worse still, the Treasury estimates that the average cost of compliance will be $46\/hour. At that, businesses will spend $1,150,000,000 complying with this single code section. What would we rather have businesses do: build quality products, or comply with a morass of federal tax regulations? Isn\u2019t it time for real tax simplification? We need to abolish the current tax code in its entirety ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"The IRS Insanity Continues"}

Without even getting into the nature of taxation as a form of theft, these policies fundamentally erode liberty since their entire purpose is to change people's choices. If you are truly *free to choose*, then the government can't actively work to influence what choice you make!\n\nBut food injustices don't just stop there. Governments do not just influence people's choices, they deny them some of these choices all together! The most obvious example of this is the US ban on Kinder Surprise eggs, but plenty more food options are straight up banned in the US and around the world. For example, we aren't allowed horse (except in Florida) or even human (including Florida) meat.\n\nObviously, most of us can agree that murder should be illegal, but the government doesn't have the right to decide what a person can or cannot do with their bodies after they die. If someone wants to donate all of their organs upon death, so be it; if someone wants to donate or sell their body to science, more power to them; if someone wants to sell their meat, why the hell not?\n\nSimilarly, the government has no right to decide what people can and cannot eat. Freedom of choice in the food we eat is a natural right! If an individual voluntarily buys human meat from a willing, voluntary seller who acquired their meat with full consent, there should be no problem!\n\nInB4 \"Eating human meat is disgusting\/immoral\/wrong.\" Just because something is \"icky\" doesn't mean the government should ban it. Also, before the lawyers show up and try to tell me there are no laws against eating human meat, the practice is functionally illegal. Laws against \"desecrating a corpse\" make it impossible for someone to *choose* to eat what they want.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"[Rant] The government has no right to decide what you can and cannot eat"}

After [my previous post](https:\/\/www.removeddit.com\/r\/AgainstHateSubreddits\/comments\/9gl26q\/the_donald_is_a_violent_extremist_group_being\/), they have switched to using [another (similar) domain (geotus(dot)band)](https:\/\/reddit.com\/domain\/geotus%2Eband\/top?t=all). The domain is [registered and hosted in America](https:\/\/whois.domaintools.com\/geotus%2Earmy), so naturally this must be safe to click and upvote, right? After clicking, you might notice  **all**  the links [redirect to another website (usareally(dot)com)](https:\/\/reddit.com\/domain\/usareally%2Ecom\/top?t=all). \"USA Really\" is [registered and hosted in Russia](https:\/\/whois.domaintools.com\/usareally%2Ecom). So what gives? If you go directly to geotus(dot)army or geotus(dot)band you'll see it's a link shortener service hosted by rebrandly.co. There are plenty of reasonable uses for link shortener services, but mostly you'll find spam and sites evading bans. So why would USA Really need to use this service? If you look at [their about section](https:\/\/archive.is\/vKL4A), they conveniently link to [their LinkedIn page](https:\/\/archive.is\/o\/qIDX7\/https:\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/usa-really). Wait, who's running this site? [Alexander Malkevich](https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/meet-man-behind-new-pro-trump-russian-website-u-s-2-102124858.html), you know, the guy that works for [Yevgeny Prigozhin](https:\/\/archive.is\/uBy3B), the Russian billionaire known as \"Putin's chef\" currently under indictment by  **Robert Mueller**  for running the Russian troll farm Internet Research Agency (IRA). So, that innocent-sounding \"American\" website is actually Russian state propaganda, but big deal, there's only a few links. That's because [their previous website](https:\/\/reddit.com\/domain\/brutalist%2Epress\/top?t=all) was shut down and it has a _ton_ of links targeting The\\_Donald.

{"author":"thealexmerced","created_utc":1537572284,"num_comments":0,"score":2,"selftext":"10 Reasons to be Skeptical of Government Growth and Intervention \n\nBy Alex Merced\n\n1. The cost of living: It costs time and money to pay for taxes and complying with regulation. Many will try to offset these costs by increasing the cost of goods and services making life more expensive making more people struggle than otherwise would.\n\n2. Scarcity of labor demand: Not only will costs increase but individuals looking to make up the costs will seek more labor hours leaving less demand for labor for everyone else. Work becomes harder to find especially for hourly wage earners who find more competition for each hour.\n\n3. Lowering of Quality: When unable to recover the tax\/regulatory costs with price increases, many may try to reduce their costs instead by lowering the quality of goods and services they provide.\n\n4. Distorted Investment: Industries that are less able to reduce costs or charge more will find their profits decreased which makes it harder to attract investment capital to grow that industry. Industries with more resilient cost structures and or products with inelastic demand will see themselves abundant with capital while those that don\u2019t will be underdeveloped.\n\n5. Corruption: The more power government has the more it will attract those who want to abuse that power. A more powerful government will find itself not run by the benevolent angels many imagine but by corrupt tyrants who buy favor with carve outs from governments costs.\n\n6. Lack of Diversification: If Government becomes the sole provider or purchaser of a good or service you create a systemic risk. When one institution is the sole provider\/purchaser, its possible future failure results in pain and suffering of everyone without a backup.\n\n7. Poor Governance: Even If run by the most well intentioned, if government handles too many areas of our lives it creates an inability for those at the top to have the broad expertise or ability to oversee all of it effectively. Those who do too much do little well.\n\n8. Rampant Extortion: The more rules government needs to enforce the more enforcers it will need. It will be harder to fill a growing demand for enforcement with the noble leaving many who will use their enforcement power to selectively enforce on their enemies and vice versa on those they favor. This creates a culture that makes it difficult to criticize government as its enforcement apparatus can quickly silence you.\n\n9. Social Conditioning: The less choices people get to make their lives the more their ability to effectively make decisions decays or under-develops making society more dependent.\n\n10. Accessibility: the larger government is the less accessible it becomes to those without relationships with the powerful.\n\nA world of individuals free to make choices over their life, body and property within a environment of diverse institutions has the opposite effects. This is why Libertarianism matters, so society and each of its participants can reach its potential.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"10 Reasons to be Skeptical of Government Intervention"}

{"author":"PrestigiousProof","created_utc":1537584276,"num_comments":14,"score":0,"selftext":"In the current debate over whether or not to legislate the removal of individual vaccine exemptions, the quality of the [vaccines](http:\/\/www.focusforhealth.org\/a-parents-guide-to-vaccines-environmental-toxins\/) themselves gets little attention. According to the CDC, **mumps outbreaks are on the rise despite the fact that 94.6% of children in the U.S. have had two doses of MMR vaccine.** To combat the situation, the CDC is  considering adding a third dose of MMR to the recommended [vaccine schedule](http:\/\/www.focusforhealth.org\/can-i-space-out-the-vaccine-schedule\/).\n\nIn 2010, California experienced the largest pertussis epidemic since 1958. According to the CDC, the U.S. has experienced increased pertussis disease despite high levels of vaccine coverage. **Researchers studying the pertussis outbreaks determined vaccine effectiveness dropped to less than 9%** by four years, and that the quality of immunization waned so rapidly that little protection remained 2-3 years after vaccination.\n\n[**Influenza vaccination**](http:\/\/www.focusforhealth.org\/seasonal-flu-shot-and-safety-testing\/) **has had no beneficial effect on flu mortality.** The CDC indicates vaccine effectiveness has oscillated between 10-60% from 2005-2017,  while systematic reviews show little to no benefit of inactivated influenza vaccines on flu morbidity.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that some vaccines don\u2019t work as well as advertised. And yet, instead of first making a vaccine with better effectiveness, the solution is to use the force of law to make everyone get more shots of the failing vaccine.\n\nEven when significant vaccine failure rates for vaccines are  acknowledged, the legislative solution remains fully supported. Concerns over the need for more effective vaccines are dismissed by apologetics pointing out that the current vaccines are better than nothing.\n\nThe assumption is implicit: low immunity is better than no immunity.  So, until a better vaccine comes along, accept the current shot at whatever level of immunity it provides.\n\nBut the notion that any amount of antibodies is preferable to no antibodies at all, is dangerously wrong. **The same exact antibodies that prevent disease at higher concentrations, can enhance the disease at lower concentrations.**\n\nInstead of preventing infection, the antibodies permit a more invasive spread of the virus into different cell types, enhancing the disease and making it worse than if the child had never been vaccinated.  This phenomenon is called antibody-dependent enhancement of disease, and it is a potential problem for vaccines that induce low levels of antibodies.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a theoretical concern. It has happened. Vaccine-induced  disease enhancement occurred previously with a measles vaccine that produced low levels of immunity.\n\n## From [Iankov et al. 2006](http:\/\/jvi.asm.org\/content\/80\/17\/8530.full):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* An unexpectedly severe form of measles (atypical measles) was observed in immunized persons in the mid-1960s;\n* Three doses of measles vaccine induced a short-lasting humoral immune response, followed several months or years later by susceptibility to atypical measles;\n* Antibodies recognizing measles virus can increase the efficiency of virus entry into cells of the monocytic lineage;\n* Antibody-mediated enhancement of infection may also contribute to  cytokine alteration and modulation of the innate immune mechanisms  during measles;\n* The results point to an additional pathogenic mechanism that may be  in play during measles virus infections and which may have particular  relevance to the pathogenesis of the atypical measles that is seen after  immunization.\n\nThe effect of vaccine-induced disease enhancement has been seen in clinical trials for a since abandoned HIV vaccine.\n\n## From [Huisman et al. 2009](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19022319):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Certain experimental vaccines have proved to be counterproductive:  they rendered vaccinated subjects more susceptible to infection rather  than protecting them;\n* For candidate HIV vaccines a number of phase III trials have been  conducted in seronegative volunteers at high risk for HIV infection;\n* The outcome of these trials was far from encouraging, with very  limited induction of HIV neutralizing antibodies, and no evidence for  protection;\n* In one clinical trial, a significant trend towards increased HIV-1 infection was observed;\n* Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection remains a significant concern in the development of safe and effective vaccines;\n* There may well be a delicate balance between the induction of  protective immunity on the one hand and the induction of enhanced  susceptibility on the other.\n\n**The** [**HPV vaccine**](http:\/\/www.focusforhealth.org\/a-closer-look-at-hpv-vaccine-effectiveness\/) **exhibited the capacity to enhance HPV infections during clinical trials.** Women who tested positive for vaccine HPV serotypes by PCR analysis, and were then administered the vaccine, were more likely to  develop high-grade cervical lesions than the non-vaccinated control group. These observations have persisted beyond clinical trials, and  antibody-dependent enhancement has been raised as a possible  explanation.\n\n## From [Manos 2009](http:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/lancet\/article\/PIIS0140-6736(09)61821-3\/fulltext):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Vaccination of women with previous HPV 16 or 18 infection might actually increase their risk of high-grade cervical disease;\n* This observation is strikingly consistent with reports on the quadrivalent HPV vaccine;\n* Although each trial\u2019s finding was attributed to imbalances in the  baseline characteristics of the vaccine and placebo groups, the  biological phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease  should be considered;\n* Perhaps HPV testing should precede vaccination and be contraindicated for women and girls previously infected.\n\nIt\u2019s been known for decades that non-neutralizing influenza  antibodies can augment the uptake of influenza A virus strains, but it  wasn\u2019t until recently that the phenomenon of disease enhancement for  influenza vaccination was observationally proven.\n\nIn 2009, seasonal influenza vaccination increased the risk of  pandemic influenza illness in those who received the vaccine. This  result was confirmed in four observational studies. \u00a0Antibody-dependent  enhancement of disease has been proposed as the potentiating mechanism.\n\nVaccines sometimes do nothing \u2500 they cause no harm as they fail to protect the vaccine recipient from disease.\n\n**Sometimes vaccines do worse than nothing** \u2500 they cause more cases, and more severe cases of disease in those who opt to be vaccinated.\n\nLow levels of antibodies cannot be viewed as less of a  good thing. Ineffective vaccines are a bad thing. They stimulate low  level immune responses that sometimes potentiate the exact diseases they  were intended to prevent.\n\nLegislation that would force the use of an ineffective vaccine must be abandoned.\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough. The ineffective product itself must be abandoned.\n\nAccording to the FDA, vaccine policy that mandates usage of an  ineffective vaccine leads to disease outbreaks in older age groups that  are more likely to suffer complications from disease.\n\nVaccine policy aimed at preventing outbreaks and eradicating disease  can only succeed when there is high vaccine uptake of an effective  vaccine. If one is missing, there is no point in having the other.\n\nNew vaccines are required. The continued use of some of the current,  poorly-performing vaccines, moots any perceived necessity to legislate  forced uptake, because no amount of vaccine uptake will prevent disease  outbreaks.\n\nEven with 100% compliance, outbreaks would still occur because the  vaccines are not effective enough to provide population level immunity  sufficient to prevent epidemics.\n\nFurthermore, outbreaks will continue to occur in older age groups  where complications from disease are more common, and mothers will have  little to no immunity to provide to their newborns during those early  critical months of life.\n\nIndividuals should have the legal right to exempt themselves and  their children from using the current products. For practical and  ethical reasons, the conversation to mandate the use of vaccines  shouldn\u2019t even be considered until more effective products are  available.\n\nEdited from [here](https:\/\/vaccineimpact.com\/2018\/mandating-ineffective-vaccines-creates-public-health-crisis-as-ineffective-vaccines-can-actually-enhance-disease\/)\n\n**References:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.

The food doesn't represent the grocery store's artistic ability, the food is a commodity.  \n\nDo you agree regarding not allowing grocery stores to discriminate?

I am a social libertarian leftist-classicliberal constitutional moderate, secular humanist naturalist.

I was recently talking to another libertarian who had a huge gripe with Greenway (a micronation I created) using taxation to gather money, so I recently thought I could make taxes voluntary and still make all the other stuff work out. Check out the recent amendment below. I need help making this better, or at least getting some feedback from people so I can do the best job possible for Greenway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrom the draft constitution of Greenway:\n\n\"The power of taxation is a privilege bestowed upon government as a means to an end, to meet the duties and responsibilities set forth in this constitution. The power to levy taxes is not power to compel another to pay taxes, and people may optionally decline to pay taxes in return for not receiving government benefits\/services\/programs, and individual government benefits\/services\/programs will be available for purchase by them, instead of paying taxes to cover all government benefits\/services\/programs. Under this constitution, they are excluded in the language of benefits\/services\/programs provided through taxes to Residents, the People, and Citizens of Greenway and of each State without paying for such benefits\/services\/programs individually, with the exception of the census along with State and National defense which they may benefit from freely. A taxpayer identification card will be issued each year to all tax paying Individuals, and children shall be covered under either of their legal guardians paying taxes for that year.\"\n\nSee the entire draft constitution of Greenway @ [https:\/\/operationgreenway.wordpress.com\/2017\/08\/02\/draft-constitution-of-greenway\/](https:\/\/operationgreenway.wordpress.com\/2017\/08\/02\/draft-constitution-of-greenway\/)","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"USA style constitutional amendment making taxes voluntary (operation greenway)"}

I just wanted to create an alt account for political posts (hence my username).  \n\n\nSo, with that said, here's a bit about me: I'm 31 years old, I'm autistic, I have severe social anxiety and depression, and I suffer most days with chronic pain due to quite a few different digestive disorders. All of this has made it nearly impossible for me to support myself financially. (I do have a part-time job as a Library Page, but that doesn't make nearly enough to cover the basics, and at this point in time, I don't have the capabilities to work more, especially since my job is incredibly stressful and exhausting.) Therefore, I get some extra financial help from welfare programs. Libertarianism, as a philosophy, discourages those very programs, since it deems them to be a form of slavery, and a way of stealing people's money from them.   \n\n\nSo do you all think that I shouldn't be able to get the very financial help that is currently keeping me alive and somewhat-healthy? Or do you think that I should have to depend on privately-run charities, which are often poorly-funded? I actually found housing through a privately-run charity, and this charity goes through staff members super-quickly because it can't afford to pay them much, and the accommodations I get through my housing are very poor. (The heating doesn't work well enough during the winter, for one thing, and I'm not allowed to have a space heater, which means that I don't sleep well during the winter months. My kitchen stove and refrigerator are also so old that I'm worried about them breaking down or being a fire hazard.)   \n\n\n\"Why don't you just stand up for yourself?\" you might ask. Well, I'm very averse to conflict due to my anxiety issues, so I don't exactly want to do something that could cause me to have a panic attack. So I'm stuck with the stressful job and poor accommodations that I have. I also can't exactly cure any of my conditions, so there goes that chance of improving my life. It just seems to me like you libertarians would just rather ignore people like me and let us suffer, all in the name of having a bit more money to spend on yourselves.

Now, she invented this robotic arm which is made to look like Obama\u2019s arm. If you are thinking, is this arm used in ways that could help society? The answer is no, it\u2019s not. She uses the arm for her sexual pleasure. She makes the Obama arm do sexual gestures, such as fingering, etc. Then a few days later, she makes an Obama sex doll with a functioning penis. It is to be said she has intercourse with the Obama sex doll at least 7-10 times a day. This obsession went as far as this woman pretending to be disabled so she can get money from the government. This is all so she can sexualize and obsess over Obama. The government is still looking into her case to she if she\u2019s actually disabled or not. To my perspective, she is absolutely brain-fucked, this woman craves sex with a former president who didn\u2019t do damn shit to our country, and also lied about where he was born. This woman needs to be received some sort of therapy so her obsession with Obama can lower. Anyways, if the government finds out she isn\u2019t actually disabled, her plan is to become a movie director and a porn star so she can make a movie dedicated to her \u201csex life\u201d with her Obama sex doll. She actually thinks she could make millions of dollars on a movie dedicated on her insanity. Obama\u2019s reaction to this woman\u2019s obsession was priceless. He was a bit terrified to find out this woman was craving sex towards him, and being an absolute psychopath. Michelle hired 12 bodyguards to protect their house just in case this woman somehow finds their address. The entire Obama family knows about this woman, and they are trying to avoid her at all costs. Let\u2019s not forget to mention that this woman also has a total of 84 tattoos all relating to Obama\u2019s somehow. She even has tattoos of Obama\u2019s face on both of her breasts.

Conversely,   when positive posts were withheld from users, they then used fewer   positive emotional words and began using more negative    ones. **By     manipulating what a person    sees on their social media account,    Facebook  was able to alter the    content the users themselves then    produced**.[\\[3\\]](https:\/\/www.counter-currents.com\/2018\/09\/social-media-censorship-as-psychological-warfare\/#_ftn3)\n\nThe   results were remarkable, researchers found emotional suggestion can        very much happen via online social networks, and social media     companies    can and will intentionally manipulate the mood of their     users.

I would not put     anything  past these people.\n\nThere is also those remaining on social media, being gaslit by the absence of those who share their sentiments, to consider. **When   all they  see on their newsfeeds are those sanitized views that  remain,   they begin to think that they are the only \u201ccrazy\u201d ones who  have such   ideas**.\n\n**Twitter,   the Anti-Defamation League, and others are indeed influencing the        political discourse, unilaterally deciding what ideas can be be   discussed and which can\u2019t.

They got to save themselves. But who\u2019s going to save those animals? That\u2019s what we did,\" Hedges said. \"We saved them.\"\n\nThe owner of Crazy's Claws N Paws, a donation-based animal rescue center, was in the process of converting a warehouse space into a proper animal shelter when she decided to use the building to help keep pets dry. However, her facility was not legally registered as a shelter.\n\n\u201cOur mission was to save as many animals from the flood that we could,\" Hedges said. \"We went through Hurricane Matthew and it was horrible. There were many preventable deaths.\u201d\n\nShe said an elderly couple dropped off 18 of the animals, some of which were sick and injured, just before the storm.\n\nOn Monday, after Florence passed, Hedges got a call from Wayne County Animal Control regarding the animals.\n\n\u201cHe basically told me, 'You can voluntarily hand over the animals, or I can go get a warrant,' \" Hedges said.\n\nShe willingly surrendered the animals.\n\n\"A few days later they called me in for questioning and yesterday they arrested me,\" Hedges said.\n\nThe charges included 12 counts of practicing medicine without a veterinary license.\n\nThe non-profit updated a Facebook status to breakdown the charges:\n\n\"1 count of administering amoxicillin to Big Momma, 1 count of administering Tramadol to Big Momma, 3 counts of administering amoxicillin to a white Siamese cat, 3 counts of administering a topical antibiotic ointment (triple antibiotic from Dollar Tree) to a white Siamese cat, 3 counts of administering amoxicillin to a cat known as Sweet Pea, 1 count of administering amoxicillin to an unnamed black kitten, and 1 count of solicitation to commit a crime,\" the non-profit writes.\n\n\"It was all over-the-counter stuff you could literally find at Dollar Tree,\" said Raina Nyliram, 24, an animal rescue volunteer who started a crowdfunding campaign for Hedges to help cover legal fees. \"She couldn\u2019t get the animals to the vet because the vet was closed. All the charges are bogus.\"\n\nJust days before the good deed went punished, the unregistered shelter was seeking volunteers to help take care of rescue animals.\n\n\"Please share this for anyone in the Wayne County or nearby areas that may need a place to stay or be able to help. If they have a pet and need some place to go, or just like animals, and are in need of a place to stay, we'd love to help them, in exchange for their overnight help,\" the center posted on Facebook.\n\nOne of those volunteers, Kathie Davidson, said she was \"shocked and saddened\" when animal control showed up to to take the pets.\n\n\"Of course this whole situation is unbelievable,\" Davidson said. \"The animals seized were to be returned to their owners after the storm.\" Instead, she said that Animal Control has the pets.\n\n\"If they can't find the owners, the pets went from a safe place to a kill shelter,\" Hedges said.\n\nThe county issued a statement about the incident:\n\n\"Wayne County Animal Services turned the case over to the Wayne County District Attorney\u2019s office based on suspicion of practicing veterinarian medicine without a license and presence of controlled substances. Ms. Hedges is considered innocent until proven guilty.\"\n\nThe office said that all the animals that were surrendered were checked out by a licensed veterinarian and that it is working to reunite them with their owners.\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Saving pets without a permit"}

Most are housed in facilities owned by three companies: CoreCivic (formerly Corrections Corporation of America), GEO Group (formerly Wackenhut,) and Management and Training Corporation. Together these, three companies spent\u00a0over 1.6 million dollars in lobbying in fiscal year 2017-2018 - with GEO Group spending nearly one million by itself.\n\n\nPrivate prisons have been vilified by many for their tendency to hire under-trained staff, deny medical treatment, fail to implement effective security measures (leading to escapes and violence,) and much more. All of this is available to the discerning reader with access to any one of several\u00a0[popular Internet search engines,](https:\/\/duckduckgo.com\/) so I will not repeat them here, with one exception:\u00a0[Here's a link to reporter Shane Bauer's article about his four months undercover working at a private prison in Louisiana.\u00a0](https:\/\/www.motherjones.com\/politics\/2016\/06\/cca-private-prisons-corrections-corporation-inmates-investigation-bauer\/)\n\n\nAnother popular criticism of private prisons is the belief that they have somehow caused the current over-incarceration culture of America.\u00a0[Robby Suave addresses this much better than I can, in this article for\u00a0Reason](https:\/\/reason.com\/blog\/2016\/08\/18\/the-justice-departments-war-on-private-p\/print), but his basic argument (copy &amp; pasted directly from his subtitle) is that private prisons are a symptom. Mass incarceration is the disease - one that, suggests Robert Pfaff,\u00a0[has surprisingly little to do with the War on Drugs, and lot more to do with prosecutorial power creep, as described in this article in The New Yorker.](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2017\/04\/10\/how-we-misunderstand-mass-incarceration)\n\n\nBut do private prisons actually save any money? That's the standard justification for privatization - the private company can do it for less. What about quality? Do private prisons do a better job of being prisons (whatever that means?) Do they, for example, have less recidivism than public prisons? The answer,\u00a0[according to Sasha Volokh for the\u00a0Washington Post, is a resounding \"maybe.\"](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/volokh-conspiracy\/wp\/2014\/02\/25\/are-private-prisons-better-or-worse-than-public-prisons\/) There simply aren't enough good studies, and the ones that do exist often contradict each other. We simply don't know if private prisons are any better or worse than public prisons at any metric, except health care, which is so bad at private prisons that Arizona simply won't send prisoners with known health problems to any private prison.\n\n\nLibertarians, with our inherent distrust of all things government, often cheerlead privatization of traditionally government institutions. Government, not being responsive to market forces, is almost always more inefficient and wasteful, and provides lower quality service, than a private company which has to compete for customers with other private companies.\n\n\nBut that last bit is the key. The private company isn't more efficient by virtue of not being government controlled; it is more efficient because if it is not, it will lose market share to its competition, as dissatisfied customers take their business - and their money - elsewhere.\n\n\nThe current private prison model has, for its customers, the government. And so every failing of a government-run operation will be transferred to the private operation, because while in both cases the government is paying for the service, it is not subject to any dissatisfaction that may result from bad service. It is not your Senator whose fingers and toes will be amputated from gangrene because his diabetes was untreated; it is not your Representative who will miscarry on a dirty floor, her cries for help ignored because the facility isn't equipped to deal with pregnancies, who will later discover that the body of her child was discarded with the dirty linen; your Assemblyman need have no fear of being abandoned in a cell with a violent rapist to be attacked for hours, his screams unheard and all emergency call buttons disabled.\n\n\nTo be sure, these problems are not exclusive to private prisons. In fact, I have given three true stories, one of which I head first hand from a witness - the first from a private prison, the second from a county jail, the third from a state prison.\n\n\nBut for Libertarians whose first instinct is that privatization is the cure for all ills, consider that the private prison is still a monopoly operated by charter from the government. They are private in name only, as there can be no competition - just as with any other government monopoly. (Don't believe me? Fine. Start your own private prison and start locking up criminals without that government contract and see just how far you get.)\n\n\nSo should Libertarians support private prisons? By all indications they aren't really that private - they benefit from not being subject to open records laws (part of the reason we don't really know if they're more violent or have more complaints,) and while those in public prisons are subject to an often obscure and seemingly arbitrary grievance procedure, those in private prisons often have no recourse at all except a lawsuit - which a typical prisoner can't hope to pay for. They are held to a lower standard than federal or most state prisons, they have little to no accountability or transparency, and there is no way for those affected by their service to refuse it.\n\n\nFor these reasons, I reject the current private prison model as widely practiced in the United States, and I urge all other Libertarians to reject it as well.\n\n\nBut does that mean that the concept of a privatized prison, in general, is inherently bad? I don't think so. A business will naturally operate in such a way as to optimize their earnings and minimize their costs. While our current model bases earnings on the number of prisoners held, and considers everything else to be a cost, it doesn't have to be that way.\n\n\nProfit motive is, however, a powerful tool. It is neither good nor evil, but can be used to good or evil ends. What if we could incentivize rehabilitation, instead of recidivism? Remember that the goal of a system of justice is to protect the life, liberty, and property of the people - including the people in the system. What if we can make a profit, not from locking more people in cages, but by reducing crime?\n\n\nConsider a private prison whose earnings are based on lowering recidivism. As released prisoners stay out of trouble, the prison receives payments. They do not receive these payments when prisoners reoffend. The company will seek to optimize their earnings: They will look for the most cost-effective tools that can be proven to reduce recidivism. (Compare this to current rehabilitation programs, which (from the point of view of someone who's participated in them) are designed to receive government grants and sound good as a doctoral dissertation. Programs are created, used for a few years, discarded, with little to no tracking information about their effectiveness.)\u00a0\n\n\nIs such a thing even possible?\n\n\n[Yes it is.](https:\/\/www.prisonlegalnews.org\/news\/2017\/feb\/7\/australia-uses-recidivism-based-performance-contract-private-prison\/)\n\n\nhttp:\/\/libertyinjustice.blogspot.com\/2018\/09\/private-prisons.html\n","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Private Prisons \u2022 Liberty inJustice"}

Knows the most basic of words but is at the level of maybe a two year old English-wise compared to the other kids, including several who are both native Spanish\/English speakers. Basically knows \"yes\", \"no\", \"juice\", etc. \n\nHe's only been here for less than a month and I've seen his incredibly limited vocab double in that time. I'm embarrassed to say it but I'm very uneducated about this type of thing and I thought he was speaking Portuguese or something similar up until last week. The kids are split into small groups by age and I'm usually not in charge of his group unless it's at the end of the day, in my defense.\n\nThe hosts of the daycare are very into nerd culture and some of the daycare is very decorated with (child friendly) sci-fi and fantasy stuff. I'm not too into it myself but I like listening to them and I (usually) like their passion.\n\nOne day I was curious what language the child was speaking so I looked up what Portuguese actually sounded like and realized it wasn't that. Looked up a lot of languages and for the life of me could not identify it. The single dad who picked him up looked like a nice dude and one day he was one of the last people to pick up that day so I asked him what language his kid spoke.\n\nThe bosses of the daycare were there too when I asked and they all suddenly got big smiles on their faces and explained to me in depth that the guy was a linguistics hobbyist who was trying to recreate an experiment where he raises his kid to speak a language from the tv show Star Trek (klingon.)\n\nHe explained how at home he only has spoken Klingon (which is apparently a real full language) to the kid and that's all he knows. My bosses LOVE that he is doing this and he does too, he told me to look up the experiment and read about it. My bosses even learned a small bit of the language themselves so that when they talk to the kid they don't say it. \n\nIt sounded kinda cool at the time but I didn't really think about it too much. When I looked it up I found out that the guy who did it taught his kid Klingon AND English at the same time. I assumed that this guy was doing the same and I just misunderstood but when I clarified next time he confirmed that the kid was ONLY being taught Klingon on purpose and he was going to try and continue the \"experiment\" for as long as possible. \n\nHe also told me about his blog and I checked it out where he describes this all and he basically states in it that he is fully aware that this will make it \"slightly\" hard for the kid to speak english later but that the experience is worth it. He even has limited the kids intake of media very severely so far to avoid shows with a lot of speaking\/words.\n\nThe kid is fairly isolated and generally acts a bit socially \"off\", if I can say that without being mean. Not like misbehaving but he clearly has small issues interacting with kids his age who all talk a lot already.\n\nI've brought it up casually with my bosses but they basically love this dude and what he is doing and don't see a problem with it. I feel terrible but I feel like I should report this? Is this child abuse? This guy basically is mispurposely not teaching his kid to how to interact with other people for the level of \"it's just a social experiment bro\", it's nuts to me.\n\nIf I'm wrong and this isn't dangerous I apologize. It feels awful to me though. I like my job otherwise but if I had to lose it for this i could find another one, have some savings, i feel too bad for this kid.","subreddit":"legaladvice","title":"[CA] A student at the preschool I work at is only being taught a fictional language""num_comments":46,"score":7,"selftext":"","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"\"I dont like the language my student's parents are teaching him at home.

{"author":"ForwardSynthesis","created_utc":1537880849,"num_comments":8,"score":1,"selftext":"One side of libertarianism is freeing property use that does not physically harm other persons or property from legal restriction, but the other side then necessarily involves responsibility for your property where that is NOT the case. Obviously there's lots of different ways that could be hashed out. What do you personally think counts?\n\nI would definitely say that if you own a dog and they kill someone, you are culpable for the act, but on the other hand if someone trespasses on your land property or in your home or factory and they get injured or killed that should remain entirely their fault. \n\nPollution is tricky, but assuming a libertarian state, it should be the case that the people nearby can prevent some degree of emission outside the bounds of the polluters property if they see fit. You'd still have to have some cut off point for how little is too little and how far away a property can be to have some say, but that should be established by court precedent, rather than by a flat law. Do easement rights apply to pollution as well as persons? They probably should to some degree in order to have industry at all, but it can't be unlimited with no restrictions, otherwise you are violating property rights massively by creating some element that is then invading the property of others through the air. \n\nAnother issue is whether conventional corporations would exist, or whether business would be structured in a totally different way in a minarchistic state. Would limited liability exist for example? Should courts find people directly responsible for their investments?","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Libertarianism involves responsibility for property too, right?"}

You're not going to get center or left of center people on your side if you completely ignore inequality.\n\nIt's not the unfairness that is the problem. It's the fact that excessive inequality can destabilize society and wreak havoc on social mobility. It can destroy the very principle of limited government. After all, if we get to a point where there are trillionaires walking around, they'll have the power to destabilize the economy, or buy lobbyists, pay for ads to influence the public, pay for people who can pay for ads that can influence the public in order to create crony systems.\n\nWe do need inequality and a *lot* of it. But you need to take a scientific mindset. If one person had 100 trillion dollars and everyone else had 100, that would destabilize itself immediately. If everyone had the exact same amount of money, no one would work and the system would collapse (as we've seen). So, obviously the happy ground is *somewhere* between this extremes. What you have to stop doing is black and white thinking, where the opinion that massive inequality is a problem is labelled as socialism.

Naturally, I will argue for my point of view, but I will be absolutely respectful, because, above all, I am here to learn and to understand a point of view that is likely very different to mine. I have recently started a new movement and this is an introduction to it. I have no issue with criticism and strong feedback, but it would be nice for all to have a mature discussion. That is what I am interested in. Without further a do...\n\n**Why are we struggling to survive when we no longer need to? An introduction to the 'Enough' movement**\n\nWe believe that humanities technological and social progress means that we now have the means and the resources to make it possible to end the struggle for survival for all human beings. We believe that every human being on this planet can have the food, water, clothing, shelter, medicine, safety, and education, not just to survive, but to thrive too. \n\nWe take it as self-evident that *if* all human beings can live in material security then all human beings *should* live in material security. Why? Because the struggle for survival not only causes immense suffering for the individual, but the means by which we attempt to meet our needs frequently causes immense and vast suffering in communities and between nations. \n\nPut simply, we would live in a much happier, more peaceful, and more evolved world if all human beings were free from the struggle for survival, and instead able to pursue their own interests and passions, and to nurture and express their talents, not only for their own personal fulfilment, but also for the betterment of our species.\n\nWe have entered a dark period for humanity. A time of escalating conflict and deep divides, and, yet, fundamentally we share and pursue the same needs and the same goals. Above all else, all human beings are united in the deepest, most primal wish for material security, for themselves and their loved ones. It is this common goal that unites all human beings, and which, in aspiring towards, we can unite and come together to achieve for the whole. \n\nIn the pursuit of this vision, I am deeply committed to listening to and understanding all sides, to finding common, agreed ground, and to working towards a solution, a compromise, a cooperation that is of mutual benefit to all. I have no interest in opposing anyone, defining enemies amongst my fellow human beings, judging who is right and who is wrong, fighting anyone or anything\u2026 as a species we can no longer afford such indulgences, nor do we have the time to bicker and quarrel amongst ourselves. Not whilst eight million children die because of poverty each year, not whilst nuclear weapons threaten our very existence, and not when environmental disaster looms over the very planet we need above all else to continue to survive. \n\nIf you are interested in reading more or becoming involved then you can follow us on Twitter, like our Facebook page, visit our website, or email us. The links are below. I am really interested to hear your feedback.

However, I think he may be falling into the \"zero sum thinking\" trap many socialists do.\n\nI agree with his argument than any redistributive policies have zero (or negative) sum effect overall. I also agree that taxpayer funding (or deficit spending) for public works also is zero\/negative sum. Finally, I agree that printing money for redistributive programs also simply reduces purchasing power for all others, and is again zero sum.\n\nHe makes the argument over and over that only production creates wealth. I can buy that.\n\nSo, what about public works? (Muh roads, yadda yadda). Couldn't one argue that roads, dams, and other infrastructure projects (and maintenance) increase the wealth of the country by their existing? Before was nothing, now there's a road. That has equity value. The road increased the value of land around it. It increased the productivity and utility of those who use it. It has, it seems, created wealth for the country.\n\nCouldn't we then fund those projects by printing money? Not deficit spending, but simply increasing money supply by the net amount it cost to build\/maintain the infrastructure. Since that money is \"backed\" by an equivalent increase in national equity\/production\/etc. it would seem to NOT have an inflationary impact.\n\n(Yes I know none of this is \"real libertarianism\" but as a step towards reducing taxation and providing for some limited public expenditure, this seems like an option).\n\nWhat's wrong with this thinking?

I am most familiar with that market, so i took it as an example as it also has exceptionally high upfront costs and no guarantee of money payback. \n\nFirst, non licensed architechtures.  I am going to use a GPU here as an example. The cost to develop a new architechture for a new GPU is insane. It takes most often more than 5 years to develop any GPU architechture from scratch, and for that time you have to pay a lot of the top architechts in the world, which is not cheap. The cost of just the design process often reaches close to ten billion US dollars. Not to mention you have to also  fabricate the silicon. Building your own fabrication plant takes easily more than 10 billion dollars. You might turn to third party fabrication and try to get the  silicon manufactured by someone like TSMC or GloFo, but in order to do that you  have to outbid everyone else at the auctions for manufacturing the silicon, which includes buisnesses like Apple, Samsung and Intel. Oh also, for the development process you have no guarantee of success. Your team might come up with something truly amazing or something not very good. How a free market in the case of a monopoly or a duopoly allow any competition in this kind of space? The initial investments just seem way too high for anyone to enter. Upfront cost of close to 10 billion dollars and no guarantee of getting any of that money back, and anywhere from few billion to tens of billions of dollars extra to get it manufactured.\n\nSecond, licensed architechtures. How would a free market allow any competition in the desktop CPU space or similar market? All the previously mentioned restrictions with money and no payback guarantee still apply, but now the starting company that wishes to compete has another restriction: They cannot legally sell CPUs with the instruction set used in desktops and laptops. That instruction set is patented heavily by Intel, and licensed only out to AMD, who hold the other half of the instruction set that makes practically all software developed for computers in the last 20 years to work. Why would they cross license it out to a competetor? What is the free markets solution to this?\n\nI would really appreciate if someone actually read through this and tried to understand it (im not very good at formalizing english), and responded. I understand that these situations are not supposed to happen in the first place, but as they exist, if world moved over to a free market they would still exist in some form, and i would like to know how it would fix these.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How does a completely free market prevent monopolies or duopolies in certain situations?"}

The goal is to keep the process about the candidates proven character, judicial acumen, and previous rulings. The reason is that good, moral candidates won't be afraid of false charges destroying their reputations.\n\nBefore any accuser is allowed a hearing before the committee or full senate:\n\n* The allegation must be specific (who, what, where, and when).\nThe \"who\" and \"what\" are obvious. The \"where\" and \"when\" are so a real investigation can be performed, and so that candidate has the chance to present an alibi.\n* Any allegations must have a contemporary police report. Not decades after the fact, and not skipped entirely. If the accuser didn't care enough to even do that when it happened, it obviously wasn't important. And if they only make their accusations in the media but refuse to talk to the police, it's just a smear job.\n* There must be at least one piece of supporting physical evidence or one corroborating witness. No pure \"he said\/she said\".\n* The accusations must be brought to the committee within a week of the announcement of the candidate. No last minute accusations as a stall tactic.\n* Any part of the accusation that is proven to be wrong (not just unproven, but demonstrably false) must be mandatorily prosecuted as perjury. Neither side may protect a false accuser just because they were a useful political pawn.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"How to Un-smear the Nomination Process for Future Judge Candidates"}

(the fine point comes in pumping of a river or oil field that extends past his land and further into watershed rights AND POLLUTION)\n\n***\n\nThe modern liberal sentiment is that roads power water and sewer can reasonably be provided for under the **common good** even though they are not for the common defense and favor different groups (roads favor the merchant group for example) **they benefit all just unequally**. \n\n* Problems arise when public good projects directly harm individuals (if we as a community decide to dam a river and it floods an established farm or mine how can we do it, what about the widening of roads?) These issues have divided liberals. \n\n* Mostly contested is the right of the group to force the individual to contribute funds to actions which do not directly benefit the individual.\n\nA major current division in liberals comes from the questions posed by futures and derivative markets and their ability manipulate other markets.\n\nA major current division in liberals comes in the validity of \"poverty floor\" actions as falling under common good.\n\nA current topic of debate is what actions are permissible in regards to 'a proposed right of commerce and labor' (Do we have the right to be served do we have the right to be employed)\n\n**Apparent divisions based on corporate rights and immigration are not divisions of liberalism** as the stances taken by these groups are in conflict with the core of laissez faire any modification of which results in a new philosophy whatever they may name themselves. \n\n***\nI believe we need a shared taxonomy of political labels so that they can accurately represent a person's views. I believe this is necessary as there is a movement towards redefining accepted terms and then attacking ones own definition (almost straw like), this leaves the person being attacked unaware of the new 'definitions' being used and unable to articulate in words that have shared meaning.\n\nMy personal beliefs are far from many who also wish to use the 'liberal' name I am not looking to showcase my personal beliefs but rather define a shared understanding of the 'liberal' movement so that we can see where we differ and if we all belong in this family of belief in political taxonomy.\n\n I considered removing reference to my personal beliefs (I copied this from a response I typed in a separate discussion) but decided to leave them as I felt they highlighted where my understanding of the counterpoint might be incomplete.","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"What is a liberal?"}

Private property let's us work, innovate, and live freely (not 100% sadly) . However, wouldn't a land value tax (LVT) create more freedom even though the government controls all land? \n\nRight now you can buy land and it's yours. Build a factory , build a house, build a life, but what if you choose not to develop it and only wait for the value to increase? Because of that a person who would of  developed it can't own it and is stuck slaving away . \n\nFrom my understanding of LVT any person can sign a contract with the government leasing the land with no upfront cost. The only price is paying the tax to the government. Plus the tax paid can be decided by the free market through an auction on the lease.  What's great about this is that it creates an incentive to develop the land or leave it to someone who would. This destroys a monopoly on land and increase competition by getting rid of a big barrier to entry. \n\nBecause land would be more accessible this way it would allow people to have a foundation to live there lives however they please. Wanna start a business? That plot of land is $5000 a year , sign the lease and you have a major piece of capital to start challanging industries.  \n\nAnother plus of LVT is  that it's ment to replace all taxes with this one single tax . (Yes taxation is theft, but I got my views) \n\nI'd love to hear your opinion on this matter. \n\nTLDR: Private ownership of land creates a monopoly on land preventing competition and abolishing private ownership of land will solve this problem.\n\n ","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Private Ownership Of Land Limits Freedom?"}

{"author":"Thomas_Eric","created_utc":1538333970,"num_comments":14,"score":1,"selftext":"\"The anarchists consider state, law, and government as superfluous institutions in a social order that would really serve the good of all, and not just the special interests of a privileged few. Only because the present social order is based on private ownership of the means of production is it necessary to resort to compulsion and coercion in its defense. If private property were abolished, then everyone, without exception, would spontaneously observe the rules demanded by social cooperation.\n\nIt has already been pointed out that this doctrine is mistaken in so far as it concerns the character of private ownership of the means of production. But even apart from this, it is altogether untenable. The anarchist, rightly enough, does not deny that every form of human cooperation in a society based on the division of labor demands the observance of some rules of conduct that are not always agreeable to the individual, since they impose on him a sacrifice, only temporary, it is true, but, for all that, at least for the moment, painful. But the anarchist is mistaken in assuming that everyone, without exception, will be willing to observe these rules voluntarily. There are dyspeptics who, though they know very well that indulgence in a certain food will, after a short time, cause them severe, even scarcely bearable pains, are nevertheless unable to forgo the enjoyment of the delectable dish. Now the interrelationships of life in society are not as easy to trace as the physiological effects of a food, nor do the consequences follow so quickly and, above all, so palpably for the evildoer. Can it, then, be assumed, without falling completely into absurdity, that, in spite of all this, every individual in an anarchist society will have greater foresight and will power than a gluttonous dyspeptic? In an anarchist society is the possibility entirely to be excluded that someone may negligently throw away a lighted match and start a fire or, in a fit of anger, jealousy, or revenge, inflict injury on his fellow man? Anarchism misunderstands the real nature of man. It would be practicable only in a world of angels and saints.\n\nLiberalism is not anarchism, nor has it anything whatsoever to do with anarchism. The liberal understands quite clearly that without resort to compulsion, the existence of society would be endangered and that behind the rules of conduct whose observance is necessary to assure peaceful human cooperation must stand the threat of force if the whole edifice of society is not to be continually at the mercy of any one of its members. One must be in a position to compel the person who will not respect the lives, health, personal freedom, or private property of others to acquiesce in the rules of life in society. This is the function that the liberal doctrine assigns to the state: the protection of property, liberty, and peace.\" - Ludwig Von Mises","subreddit":"Libertarian","title":"Why I am a Minarchist and not an Anarcho-Capitalist"}

Its one of the more beautiful places in Colorado with the Sangria de Cristo Mountains to the west and green lush valley below.  \n\nWhat makes this valley really interesting is the cost of land is dirt cheap and there is 100Mb\/s microwave internet throughout most of the valley.  I purchased almost 6 acres on a south facing hillside with a fantastic 180 degree view that cost $15,000.  If, like me, you can work remotely (IT consultant and Engineer) this place is great.  Depending on where in the valley, you can still get to city services (Wal-mart, Home Depot, Safeway, etc.) in 30-45 mins and get to Pueblo in 55min. The Town of Westcliffe is about 10-15 mins depending.  \n\nThis place is very welcoming, home to some of the best outdoors recreation in the state (except skiing, 1hr away) and has great people as neighbors.  \n\nFunny thing is, you mention the Wet Valley to people in Colorado Springs or Pueblo and they have no idea what you are talking about so its kind of *hidden*.
