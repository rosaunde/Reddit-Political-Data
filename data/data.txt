Title: Liberal Hypocrisy of saying “I’ll leave the US if Trump wins”...what could be more offensive to immigrants who try as hard as they can, often giving their lives, just for the chance of living in America., score: 10, author: newjerseycaptain, time: 1545777038.0, selftext: I think it’s a great talking point that I’ve never heard discussed seriously by any conservative political commentators. So many celebrities threw the idea of leaving the US if Trump won in 2016 around (of course none actually did) lightheartedly. Did they not know that thousands and thousands have died trying to come to this country? How offensive for them to flaunt their privilege of living in this great land around by saying “they will leave” as if people won’t still try to come here both legally and illegally for a chance at a better life. For a group that blames the other side for their privilege often, I think saying you would leave is the most privileged statement. Millions would (and do) give their life so their relatives can live in America. Shame on Hollywood and their entitled culture for belittling the concept of living in America—something many deserving immigrants may never obtain.
