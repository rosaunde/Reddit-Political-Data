{"author":"GenosseMarx","created_utc":1509627883,"num_comments":9,"score":57,"selftext":"&gt; After Lenin's death Stalin as the chief leader of the Party and the state creatively applied and developed Marxism-Leninism. In the struggle to defend the legacy of Leninism against its enemies - the Trotskyites, Zinovievities and other bourgeois agents - Stalin expressed the will and wishes of the people and proved himself to be an outstanding Marxist-Leninist fighter. The reason Stalin won the support of the Soviet people and played an important role in history was primarily that he, together with the other leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, brought about the triumph of socialism in the Soviet Union and created the conditions for the victory of the Soviet Union in the war against Hitler; these victories of the Soviet people conformed to the interests of the working class of the world and all progressive mankind. It was therefore quite natural for the name of Stalin to be greatly honoured throughout the world. But having won such high honour among the people both at home and abroad by his correct application of the Leninist line, Stalin erroneously exaggerated his own role and counterposed his individual authority to the collective leadership, and as a result certain of his actions were opposed to certain fundamental Marxist-Leninist concepts he himself had propagated....\n\n&gt; Marxist-Leninists hold that leaders play a big role in history. The people and their parties need forerunners who are able to represent the interests and will of the people, stand in the forefront of their historic struggles, and serve as their leaders. But when any leader of the Party or the state places himself over and above the Party and the masses, instead of in their midst, when he alienates himself from the masses, he ceases to have all-round, penetrating insight into the affairs of the state. As long as this was the case, even so outstanding a personality as Stalin could not avoid making unrealistic and erroneous decisions on certain important matters... During the later part of his life, Stalin took more and more pleasure in this cult of the individual and violated the Party's system of democratic centralism and the principle of combining collective leadership with individual responsibility. As a result, he made some serious mistakes: for example, he broadened the scope of the suppression of counter- revolution; he lacked the necessary vigilance on the eve of the anti- fascist war; he failed to pay proper attention to the further development of agriculture and the material welfare of peasantry; he gave certain wrong advice on the international communist movement, and, in particular, made a wrong decision on the question of Yugoslavia. On these issues, Stalin full victim to subjectivism and one-sidedness and divorced himself from objective reality and from the masses.\n\n&gt; The cult of the individual is a rotten carry-over from the long history of mankind. The cult of the individual is rooted not only in the exploiting classes but also in the small producers. As is well known, patriarchism is a product of small-producer economy...\n\n&gt; The struggle against the cult of the individual, which was launched by the Twentieth Congress, is a great and courageous fight by the communists and the people of the Soviet Union to clear away the ideological obstacles blocking their advance...\n\n&gt; It must be pointed out that Stalin's works should, as before, still be seriously studied and that we should accept all that is of value in them, as an important historical legacy, especially those many works in which he defended Leninism and correctly summarized the experience of building up the Soviet Union. But there are two ways of studying them - the Marxist way and the doctrinaire way. Some people treat Stalin's writings in a doctrinaire manner and therefore cannot analyse and see what is correct and what is not and everything that is correct they consider a panacea and apply indiscriminately, and thus inevitably they make mistakes. For instance, Stalin put forward a formula that in different revolutionary periods the main blow should be so directed as to isolate the middle-of-the-road social and political forces of the time. This formula of Stalin's should be treated according to circumstances and from a critical, Marxist point of view. In certain circumstances it may be correct to isolate the middle forces, but it is not correct to isolate them under all circumstances. Our experience teaches us that the main blow of the revolution should be directed at the chief enemy and to isolate him, whereas with the middle forces, a policy of both uniting with them and struggling against them should be adopted, so that they are at least neutralized; and'as circumstances permit, efforts should be made to shift them from their position of neutrality to one of alliance with us in order to facilitate the development of the revolution. But there was a time - the ten years of civil war from 1927 to 1936 - when some of our comrades crudely applied this formula of Stalin's to China's revolution by turning their main attack on the middle forces, singling them out as the most dangerous enemy; the result was that, instead of isolating the real enemy, we isolated ourselves and suffered losses to the advantage of the real enemy. In the light of this doctrinaire error, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China during the period of the anti-Japanese war formulated a policy of developing the progressive forces, winning over the middle-of-the roaders, and isolating the diehards for the purpose of defeating the Japanese aggressors...\n\n&gt; Some people consider that Stalin was wrong in everything. This is a grave misconception. Stalin was a great Marxist-Leninist, yet at the same time a Marxist-Leninist who committed several gross errors without realizing that they were errors. We should view Stalin from a historical standpoint, make a proper and all round analysis to see where he was right and where he was wrong and draw useful lessons therefrom. Both the things he did right and the things he did wrong were phenomena of the international communist movement and bore the imprint of the times. Taken as a whole the international communist movement is only a little over hundred years old and it is only thirty-nine years since the victory of the October Revolution; experience in many fields of revolutionary work is still inadequate. Great achievements have been made, but there are still shortcomings and mistakes....\n\n&gt; Reactionary forces the world over are pouring ridicule on this event: they jeer at the fact that we are overcoming mistakes in our camp. But what will come of all this ridicule? There is not the slightest doubt that these scoffers will find themselves facing a still more powerful, forever invincible, great camp of peace and socialism, headed by the Soviet Union, while the murderous, bloodsucking enterprises of these scoffers will be in a pretty fix. \n\n[Source.](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-7/mswv7_467.htm) A bit more critical view on Stalin.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Mao: Stalin's Place in History"}

The executive members and the lawyers of the union accompanied the workers.\u00a0\n\nHaving been informed about the protest to be organized by the workers under the leadership of Nakliyat-\u0130\u015f Union, the company surrounded the entrance of the store with iron barriers in order to prevent the protestors from getting in the store. The shutters were taken down and the security guards were highly alarmed.\u00a0\nGathering in front of the barriers, the workers issued a press release here. On behalf of the dismissed Real Market Workers, Ahmet Faz\u0131l \u015eahin pointed out the current situation.

He stated that the call for international solidarity made by this yellow union was nothing but a real hypocrisy. At the end of his statement, K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckosmano\u011flu enounced that the workers were going to get in the store and protest the injustice they face.\u00a0\n\nOn this call, Real Market Workers and the union leaders forced the barriers and tried to get in the store.

We will root out the U.S. threats of a nuclear war and safeguard peace on the Korean peninsula and in the region.\n\n&gt;The WPK will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with the communist and workers' parties of the world in the effort to advance the victory of the cause of socialism, the future of mankind. -0-","subreddit":"communism","title":"The Workers' Party of Korea Sides with Foreign Communist and Workers' Parties"}

Finally putting a term to Portugal's subjugation to UK's colonial interests, ending the royal familys ridiculous waste of money and taking away alot of the churchs power.\nThe first temporary government applied strong measures against the catholic church which lasted and developed strong anti-religious beliefs.\n\n\nHowever, the following years were anything but peaceful and almost monthly coups as well as shootings, bombings and murders prevented any political stability as anarcho syndicalists, republicans, monarchists fought for power.\n\n\nIt wasn't until 1918, after the russian revolution that socialist movements began to organize. The war had severely lowered the standard of living and a wave of strikes fought for workers rights supported by the newly formed labour movements. This helped the workers obtain the 8 hour work day.\n\n\nIn 1919 the first portuguese labour union confederation (CGT) was founded. In the same year the FMP or Portuguese Maximalist Federation was created with the purpose of promoting socialist and revolutionary movements. The FMP started publishing the bandeira vermelha (red flag) which became a popular newspaper for the working class.\n\n\nAfter some time the unrest among workers and members of the FMP culminated, with the supported of the Commintern, in the foundation of the Portuguese Comunist Party. Soon after, the Communist youth was created. Unlike most Communist Parties, PCP was not founded after a split of a socialist or social democratic party, but from syndicalist and anarcho syndicalist movements.\n\n\nIn 1926 a military coup with nationalist and anti-democratic ideologies imposed a military dictactorship and all parties were outlawed and the Communist Party had to operate in secrecy.\n\n\nSalazar ( the now head of the estado novo dictactorship) made all unions and strikes illegal in 1933. All the Communist Partys efforts had apparently been in vain as Salazar adopted Corporativist politics. Salazars fight against people who opposed his regime strongly diminished the parties influence.\n\n\nIn 1934 following the closure of a number of labour unions lead to several riots and strikes but were suppressed by a heavy military attack.\n\n\nIn 1936 a civil war erupted in Spain and an estimated 1000 portuguese communists were sent to Spain.\nIn the late 1930s many party members were sent to Tarrafals concentration camp in Cape Verde islands which were a portuguese colony.\n\n\nBy then, the Portuguese Comunist Party was thought to have been terminated.\nEnd of part 1 I guess.

Runa Evensen, leader of the Communist Party of Norway, (NKP; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Norway, a party that sadly followed the USSR in its revisionist decline, and is today very small and irrelevant), tried gallantly to defend our common historic symbol for workers and peasants alike, against Mellem's McCarthy-like rhetoric. He has also been very verbal in his critique of the fact that we who call ourselves communist celebrated the October Revolution. That should really say it all. \n\nBonus info: Mellem's Labour party (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(Norway) ), had its worst election result in 90 years! I think that the latest spouting from Mellem is a reaction caused by this result, and they try to blame these poor results on other, instead of themselves. To dig their hole deeper, they also proclaimed themselves to be against another party's proposal to end the forced returns of Afghani asylum seekers back to Afghanistan. These returns have been condemned by Amnesty, so yeah. (It also doesn't help that their former leader, and Norway's PM until 2013, Jens Stoltenberg, is now General Secretary of NATO - the largest terrorist organization in the world.\n\nOn another note, here is some information on how the group I'm supporting, celebrated the great October Revolution.

All the hacks written into the script are plausible and realistic in real life scenarios, or at least were at certain points in time, so you should especially watch it if you're into computers. Something could be gained from learning from it, as I can't help but feel that while the next revolution may not be televised, it will likely be a cyber revolution.\n\nThe revolution part is pretty obvious as they include said revolution. I feel like the first season was pretty fight club-esque and it's been pretty anarchist since, without much revealed about the plan for post revolution, or 'phase 2' of their plan as they commonly refer to it in the show. It wasn't until latest season that I've noticed some more marxist overtones. \n\nFor those that don't watch it, the plot is basically a hostile cyber attack and overthrow of the US economy, like fight club but with hacking rather than explosions. The hackers responsible refer to themselves as 'F SOCIETY' (the idea supposedly based on hackers 'anonymous'). F SOCIETY couldn't have ignited the sparks to the revolution though without their allies and Chinese counterparts (The Dark Army), who were supposed to execute the same hostile take over of the Chinese economy, simultaneously... but they didn't (and we're not told why). \n\nThe creator, Sam Esmail, while incredibly secretive with the plot and where it might be leading, does leave behind an occasional bread crumb trail, as can be seen when you rewatch episodes of previous seasons. Angela (one of the main characters) was persuaded to join the cause by White Rose (the Dark Army's leader, who's obsessed with time). In the 5th episode in season 3, the latest episode, when Angela is talking about how White Rose persuaded her to play a part in the revolution, she asks one of the dark army members if White Rose 'showed him as well'. He confirms and then she asks (I'm paraphrasing) if he thinks it can work. He replies (and again, I can't stress how much I'm paraphrasing here) that: we've made major technological advances in the last 100 years, 'its scientifically possible now'. Seeing as White Rose is obsessed with time and it's been exactly 100 years since the Russian revolution, I can't help but feel there is a Socialist sub-plot to be revealed, which has fuelled my excitement for the rest of the season to come out.\n\nThere were other little clues in this episode as well, such as the Bernie Sanders sticker on some guys computer which Elliot (the main character) is forced to use; Sam doesn't plant unnecessary props in the scene. Or like the German dude in the elevator who says to Elliot (in German) something along the lines of: 'all new beginnings are heavy, to begin is easy, persistance is an Art'. As it's in German, I feel it'll end up being a global cooperative effort, not just Chinese and F SOCIETY's involvement, to overthrow the biggest obstruction to the successful implementation of communism - The United States of America.\n\nTyrell Wellick's exile and eventual return to aid in the revolution is oddly reminiscent of Lenin in my opinion also. While Elliotand Darlene's renouncing their roll in the movement after witnessing the casualties of socioeconomic collapse is oddly reminiscent of Trotsky. This is possibly what an attempt at a communist revolution would look like if it played out in modern day Northern America.\n\nThe series also sees China in a UN meeting moving to annex the Democratic Republic of the Congo and receiving no opposition from the US representative after blackmailing him. The Congo recognized Taiwan for 10 years before switching to the People's Republic of China in 1971. Why this annexation is so crucial to the plot eludes me but all will be revealed eventually. \n\nPerhaps my predictions are incorrect but I'm pretty excited about the direction this show is headed. Viva la revoluci\u00f3n!\n\nEDIT: I'm not suggesting that Elliot or Darlene are communist. I'm suggesting they're anarchists being used by White Rose and the Dark Army (communists) to overthrow the system, which is a pretty smart play as a lot of hackers are anarchists.\n\nIt's been suggested in r/MrRobot that the annexation was in order to have control of mining rights for a rare mineral needed to build/ run an extremely large quantum computer shown in a previous episode (that being a quantum computer is a total guess, they only showed it briefly). Annexation might mean national trade of such minerals which could be completely off the radar, unlike international trade. The annexation could be them not wanting to show their hand yet.\n\nBuilding such a quantum-supercomputer could help organize a better distribution of resources with all variables considered, as well as showing that the current trajectory would lead to eventual scarcity. It may be the best form of propaganda we could harness - facts and scientific predictions. Perhaps these quantum predictions were what convinced Angela to commit to the cause.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Do any comrades watch Mr Robot?

When I first read it three years ago, I never managed to understand the capturing of value from underperforming enterprises by overperforming ones:\n\n&gt; We saw previously that  those  enterprises  which  are  above  the  average  in  their  productivity  will capture a part of the surplus value produced in other enterprises, whereas those operating at a lower than average productivity will not realise a part of the surplus value produced in their plants but must surrender it to other plants which are technologically ahead of them.\n\nThis quote is from page 34 of the previously linked .pdf. The argument is further developed in page 37, if someone needs more context.\n\n **I fail to understand how the extra surplus value realized in the overperforming enterprises was actually created in the underperforming ones.**\n\nTo make sure we are on the same page, I\u2019ll summarise my train of thought:\n\n* The exchange value (price) of a commodity is determined by the amount of socially necessary abstract human labour (which can be measured in hours).\n\n* The amount of socially necessary labour is determined as the average of the amount of labour used in each enterprise to produce the given commodity.\n\n* If an enterprise is more productive than the average (i.e. requires less human labour to produce a given commodity than the average of the industry), it is capable of benefiting from the fact that the price of the commodity is determined by an amount of labour that is actually greater the amount of labour it itself put into it.\n\n* This allows this overperforming enterprise to make more money per commodity sold than the rest of the industry. As long as the technical advantage which allowed to improve the productivity does not spread to the rest of the industry, this will continue to be the case . Once it does, the amount of socially necessary labour to produce the commodity will decrease, and this extra surplus value will disappear.\n\nIn this whole process, I fail to see how the extra bit of surplus value was actually created in the underperforming enterprises. Of course, if they hadn\u2019t existed in the first place, there would be no extra bit of surplus value (as it happens when the advantage spreads through the whole industry); still, I don\u2019t see how the value was created by them. To me, the conclusion seems similar to the \u201cThere are two Popes per kilometer squared in The Vatican\u201d statement: it holds mathematically, but only mathematically.\n\nWhat am I missing?","subreddit":"communism","title":"Can someone explain transfer of surplus value between enterprises?"}

The military claims that this is not a coup but a \"bloodless transition.\" The basis of the current crisis is claimed to be a power struggle within the Zanu-PF party over Mr. Mugabe's firing of his vice president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, and his intent to replace him with his wife.\n\nThat said, this is the BBC, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nThere is a decided lack of information, but things don't look very good. Robert Mugabe has made significant efforts to keep Zimbabwe free of domination by Western imperialism and Western capitalism. After nearly two decades of appeasing the IMF and the World Bank, Mugabe seemed to rediscover something of his Marxist roots and expelled them from the country in the late 1990s. He further aroused the anger of the West by initiating land reform in 2000, expropriating land from 4,000 white settlers and distributing it to 300,000 landless indigenous families. He has been an obstacle to the exploitation of the country by Western capital (Zimbabwe has something like 20% of the world's known diamond reserves). If this is the end of Robert Mugabe's time in power, I can only hope that whoever comes after him will be as stubbornly independent of the West as he has been these last twenty years, though I fear that they will not.\n\nFurther information would be appreciated.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Strange things going on in Zimbabwe"}

Nonostante la \u201csantificazione\u201d di Antonio \r\nGramsci, il suo pensiero e la sua teoria non sono mai penetrati nella formazione culturale del popolo e \r\ndel firmamento politico italiano (in primis dal PCI che da Togliatti in poi non si \u00e8 mai prodigato per \r\nincorporare il suo pensiero al programma politico, eccettuati alcuni \u201cpunti di eccellenza\u201d). La \r\nconoscenza epiteliale del Gramsci ha portato, specialmente in tempi recenti, a terribili mistificazioni da \r\nparte di esegeti incapaci e da citazionisti improbabili2\r\n. Troppo revisionista o addirittura \u201ctrozkista\u201d per i marxisti pi\u00f9 ortodossi, un \u201cPiccolo Lenin\u201d per alcuni \r\nstudiosi sessantottini, addirittura un liberale (certamente a torto) secondo la critica pi\u00f9 feroce: \r\nAntonio Gramsci ha sempre suscitato grandi spaccature all\u2019interno del movimento comunista e del \r\npensiero politico in genere.\r\nChi \u00e8, dunque, Antonio Gramsci? \r\nAntonio Gramsci nasce ad Ales (CA) il 22 Gennaio 1891 da Francesco Gramsci e Giuseppina Marcias. \r\nQuarto di sette figli, il giovane Antonio, o Nino come veniva affettuosamente chiamato dai familiari, \r\ndenota gi\u00e0 in tenera et\u00e0 una predisposizione per lo studio. Conclude gli studi ginnasiali (nonostante \r\nvarie vicissitudini familiari particolarmente complesse e una generale condizione di ristrettezze \r\neconomiche) e nel 1911 si trasferisce a Torino per intraprendere gli studi universitari grazie ad una \r\nborsa di studio di 70 lire mensili. A Torino fa la conoscenza di Palmiro Togliatti, anche lui sardo e \r\nborsista, suo futuro compagno di corso e di lotta e inizia a frequentare i circoli socialisti (movimento \r\npolitico conosciuto anche all\u2019influsso del fratello Carlo).\r\nNon conclude gli studi universitari, ma intraprende la carriera giornalistica collaborando dal \u201914 al \u201917 \r\ncon testate del calibro de l\u2019\u201cAvanti!\u201d, \u201cIl Grido del Popolo\u201d e \u201cLa citt\u00e0 futura\u201d. Nel 1919 fonda \u201cL\u2019Ordine \r\nNuovo\u201d assieme ai compagni Togliatti, Tasca e Terracini: l\u2019esperienza ordinovista sar\u00e0 cruciale per \r\ntutta la politica gramsciana. \r\nNel 1921, durante il XVII Congresso del Partito Socialista avviene la scissione che determina la nascita \r\ndel Partito Comunista d\u2019Italia (PCd\u2019I): tra i quindici nomi degli scissionisti aderenti al programma della \r\nTerza Internazionale figura anche quello di Antonio Gramsci (assieme a Bordiga e Togliatti). \r\nCon le elezioni del 6 Aprile 1924, Gramsci riesce ad ottenere la carica di deputato in Parlamento: pur \r\ngodendo dell\u2019immunit\u00e0 parlamentare, l\u20198 Gennaio 1926 viene arrestato dalle autorit\u00e0 fasciste. \r\nLe accuse sono le seguenti: apologia di reato, incitamento all\u2019odio di classe, incitamento \r\nall\u2019insurrezione e al mutamento violento della Costituzione, cospirazione, incitamento ai militari alla disobbedienza delle leggi, offese al capo di governo, incitamento alla disobbedienza delle leggi a mezzo \r\nstampa. \r\nSubisce il confino ad Ustica e successivamente alla sentenza del 4 Giugno 1928 viene condannato a \r\nvent\u2019anni, cinque mesi e quattro giorni di reclusione. A seguito del \u201cprocessone\u201d, il pubblico ministero \r\nMichele Isgr\u00f2 chiude la propria requisitoria affermando queste parole: \u201cPer vent\u2019anni dobbiamo \r\nimpedire a questo cervello di funzionare\u201d (obiettivo decisamente fallito). \r\nDopo undici anni di reclusione ottiene la libert\u00e0 vigilata.\r\nMuore a Roma il 27 Aprile 1937 a seguito di una emorragia celebrale, dovuta o per lo meno favorita \r\ndai lunghi anni di sofferenze nelle carceri fasciste. \r\nGRAMSCI FILOSOFO?\r\nSino ad ora si \u00e8 parlato di filosofia gramsciana o di pensiero gramsciano, il che dovrebbe logicamente \r\nfar presupporre che Antonio Gramsci \u00e8 un filosofo. A tal proposito si acquisti un qualsiasi manuale di \r\nstoria della filosofia (di quelli che si utilizzano nelle scuole superiori): i lettori pi\u00f9 attenti noteranno \r\nche Gramsci, il pi\u00f9 delle volte, non \u00e8 nemmeno citato, oppure, se \u00e8 citato, lo spazio dedicato al suo \r\npensiero \u00e8 modestissimo. \r\nQuesto per due motivi principali: in primo luogo, poich\u00e9 la sua occupazione principale (almeno prima \r\ndell\u2019arresto) non \u00e8 stata la speculazione filosofica, bens\u00ec la politica; in secondo luogo si potrebbe \r\ndedurre tale assenza dalla stessa questione politico-filosofica. Gramsci \u00e8 di fatto un marxista, un \r\nmarxista sui generis, certamente, ma in definitiva il suo pensiero, per quanto originale, non \r\nrappresenta un\u2019assoluta novit\u00e0 in termini didattici. \r\nDunque, Gramsci \u00e8 un filosofo? Certamente. Un grande filosofo politico che \u00e8 stato in grado di adattare \r\nil marxismo al \u201cnuovo mondo\u201d che andava formandosi dopo la Prima Guerra Mondiale.\r\nRicostruire il pensiero filosofico gramsciano non \u00e8 certo una facile sfida, poich\u00e9 il politico sardo non ha \r\norganizzato la sua teoria in un unico testo programmatico. Se \u00e8 vero che i \u201cQuaderni del carcere\u201d\r\nrappresentano una sorta di manifesto del gramscianesimo, \u00e8 altrettanto vero che all\u2019interno di tale \r\nopera, come precisamente affermato dallo stesso Gramsci, vi sono \u201c[\u2026] affermazioni non controllate che \r\npotrebbero dirsi di prima approssimazione: qualcuna di esse nelle ulteriori ricerche potrebbe essere \r\nabbandonata e magari l\u2019affermazione opposta potrebbe dimostrarsi quella esatta\u201d (Q. 8, paragrafo 1, \r\npag. 935). \r\nUno dei capisaldi della sua filosofia \u00e8 lo storicismo direttamente mutuato dal Croce, tuttavia con delle \r\nprecise differenze. \r\nIl Croce ritiene lo storicismo una elaborazione della filosofia hegeliana che porta a concepire lo spirito, \r\nunica vera realt\u00e0, come identico con la sua storia, giungendo cos\u00ec a negare ogni valore conoscitivo alle \r\nscienze della natura (cui \u00e8 attribuita una funzione esclusivamente pratica) e a identificare la filosofia \r\ncon la storiografia, considerata come l\u2019unica forma di conoscenza. Gramsci, pur partendo dall\u2019esempio crociano, interpreta la storia come risultato della prassi politica, \r\ngrazie alla quale gli uomini mutano la societ\u00e0. Da questo deriva che \u201cLa filosofia si sviluppa perch\u00e9 si \r\nsviluppa la storia generale del mondo, cio\u00e8 i rapporti sociali in cui gli uomini vivono\u201d. (Q. 10, paragrafo 31, p. 1273).","subreddit":"communism","title":"Antonio Gramsci, il Marx italiano."}

I'd like some feedback from some members of the sub to improve my theory on the subject.\n\nAll over the capitalist world, there is a faux political conflict put on by the bourgeois class in order to keep the proletariat distracted from the larger image of capitalist oppression. The play put on by the capitalists depicts a pendulum which swings between the \"liberal\" and the \"conservative\" party (e.g. American Democratic and Republican Parties). They are always portrayed as being on drastically different ends of the political spectrum and having next to nothing in common. The reality is that this shtick could not be farther from the truth. In almost every instance, both parties support capitalist oppression and dwell on the right wing of the political spectrum, the \"liberal\" party falling somewhere in the centre-right at best. You may be asking yourself, what does truly divide these parties in an ideological sense? This is the main point of me writing this, after all. The answer requires an analysis of both sides of this decoy spectrum used by the ruling class. \n\nThe \"liberals\" support using phoney progress on social and economic issues in an attempt to make capitalism appear more benevolent and delay a working-class revolution. The social reforms only serve to dupe working-class minorities and women into supporting their own oppression and do nothing to eliminate the social constructs such as race and gender which the bourgeoisie use as tools to prevent proletariat unification and revolution. As for the economic reforms, they seldom do anything to protect the working man and woman and only place temporary roadblocks in the bourgeoisie's path to ultimate supremacy over the planet which are lifted as soon as it's convenient and then forever forgotten. The liberals' support for the working class is completely fabricated and should be treated as such. It is contradictory to claim to wish to assist the proletariat in their struggle yet still uphold the system which oppresses them in the first place.\n\nThe \"conservatives\", on the other hand, believe it is more effective to perpetuate capitalism's worst without so much as an attempt to mask it. Unlike the \"liberals\", they believe the path to preserving capitalism's doomed system is not to make empty tweaks to the system to fool the proletariat into supporting their own oppression, but rather to accomplish the same goal using the same tired social constructs such as religion and racial division. Now, don't be fooled into thinking either of these parties has the moral high ground above the other. \"Liberals\" are more than happy to revoke every frivolity they've manufactured to distract the working class if it becomes convenient. The only difference between these two parties is the methods in which they use to cruelly and callously subvert and subjugate the proletariat class. We must expose them for what they really are. We must inform the working man and woman of the lies that have been handed to them for so many decades. It is essential to the revolutionary cause to expose this deceit once and for all.","subreddit":"communism","title":"What divides the bourgeois \"conservatives\" and \"liberals\""}

You truly changed my faith.\n\nLong story short: I was born an orphan, denied orphan status, then threw my life away completing 90% of a science degree, that I couldn't finish because of poverty.  Needless to say this radicalized me.  Even now I'm doing INSANE things to survive.  Dedicating myself exclusively to a school system where I couldn't get money for school (because I'm not an orphan *allegedly*) led me to alienate everyone I knew.  I sold dope to pay my bills.  Just to get an education.  Now, all those old \"comrades\" betrayed me for money.\n\nThe reason I'm feeling suicidal is because I feel like I'm surrounded by extreme revisionists, even in communists parties.  I'm DEAD TIRED of discussing the basics of communism.  I'm tired of talking about Trotsky and all the evul communism apologists.  The people I've seen die from capitalism makes me want to injure these \"new left\" social democratic apologists.\n\nI feel like there's no support.  No members uplifting each other.  All that happens at most party meetings is gossip and banter about liberal issues.  As a person of color, I feel like an object for their opportunism.  It's so disgusting.  I need safety from fascists and a job... not cool points.\n\nAnd the communist gangs ARE WORSE THAN THE LIBERALS.  There's utterly no intellectual connection.  NONE.  That's probably why they don't post on here.  Any lumpen repping MLs are pieces of sh**.  They think pimping women and selling drugs is the ultimate end.  I'm SO TIRED of seeing people defend this scum just because \"boo hoo capitalism\" and so they can take a picture with a homeless person.  If the labor aristocracy only knew that they'd rather steal $5 from them, instead of a build a revolution.  LUMPEN &lt;- LIBERALS.\n\nOn the other hand, the liberal infection of the \"new left\" is worse.  If ANYONE makes the SMALLEST semantic mistake, some GIANT expose MUST be published, at the cost of all else (but the author's ego).  It's INSANE.  This is opportunism to MAX.  But when a black person says a homophobic slur it's \"understandable\".  WHAT THE HELL.  If liberal communists are going to have a pity party over language, at least be consistent!  And no... I don't approve of homophobic/racist/etc language, it's just an example of poor priorities.\n\nBut this all leads up to a bigger problem... the left of America just shits their pants, scared.  I can't stand it anymore.  I'm done with crypto-Trotsky run arounds where the party turns out to be a LGBT/activist club that tries to pretend they're \"radical\".  I'm concerned with poor LGBT people, who have NO security, instead of dinner party activists.\n\nAnd the \"lumpen\" left is just a joke.  It's not even communism.  The whole mentality is \"if i sleep with every woman\" we win, or something.  It's f*cked.  It's just like fascism for real.  The motto of the streets is that the strong eat the weak, right?\n\nI'm tired of even having to DISCUSS THIS SHIT WTH.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI want to defect to DPRK, but I'm scared of being accused as a spy, considering their war.  I might join the Indian Maoists alternatively.  Maybe Nepal?  I'm willing to fight/work to the death as an alternative to this capitalist hell hole.  Please offer suggestions so I don't waste my life.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Suicidal because of revisionists - where to defect?"}

For example, I was debating with one such pro-capitalist last night who, at one point, told me that the current neoliberalist world we have is the \"end of the line\" and that 'nothing exists' afterwards. He then said a few minutes later that the only thing possible from here forward would either be a return to warlordism [sic] or just the human race outright dying along with the planet as the richest simply take their money and go off-world. I asked if that was truly what he wanted, and he didn't hesitate to answer in the affirmative; he basically said he'd rather the world burn (or in his words, flood) than have the human race work cooperatively or even consider sustainable development. Of course, I didn't bother reminding him that the money taken off-world would immediately be rendered useless, but it seemed he was so hellbent on the idea people dying rather than working together; he actually liked the idea, and he wasn't alone (though the third person was a huge fan of Ayn Rand's 'Shrugged' anyway).\n\nIn any case, does this happen to anyone else?

Evicting migrant workers, even Chinese themselves through gentrification and removing local culture into 'soulless' malls seems against that narrative, especially in the conditions reported.

Instead I left with further questions about the realities of Chinese living conditions and their future. I left with further dialectical questions of the need for cultural revolution, the role of the state and the political nature of citizens in different conditions. \n\nWhilst I would love to move to many countries and regions to gain a firsthand understanding of societal structures, conditions and futures, this is of course not simply done. I see many posts looking at the macro in a positive light, so lets discuss the insight into the micro level, from people living and seeing life in the PRC every day.

{"author":"georgewho__","created_utc":1512059704,"num_comments":25,"score":20,"selftext":"I consider myself a communist, but I still feel the Nordic Model isn't necessarily bad. The [Nordic Model](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model) is basically the social-democracy going on in Scandinavia, where even the worst jobs have what the rest of the world would consider a middle-class salary, and the richest of men aren't excessively rich. That's because of the high taxes they have, and highly ethical philosophy of life in general. They consistently rank on top of every \"Countries with the highest quality of life\" list. So, even though it's still capitalism, everyone gets to have *at least* a pretty good life in some of the most advanced countries in the world. What do you think of it, and what are the downsides that might not be so evident? \n\nEdit: Thanks for the explanations, comrades. I've only recently \"declared\" myself a communist, and I've been trying to tackle any possible philosophical and social aspect of capitalism that could ever be considered good, the Nordic Model being the last of them. Capitalism is indeed awful in any possible form of application, as I should've realized that Scandinavia's growth and profit must come from somewhere, which is the global south.","subreddit":"communism","title":"In what ways is communism better than the Nordic Model?"}
