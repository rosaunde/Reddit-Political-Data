We sit around patting each other on the back for how righteous we were in our struggles throughout the 20th century. How we stuck it to the man and fought for what was just. But I can't help but feel it was all first worldist bullshit.\n\nNorth American labour was in an enviable position after WW2. We had a near monopoly on the world's industrial production, giving workers here unprecedented bargaining power. We took what we wanted from the bourgeoisie, which in turn spawned the \"middle class.\" Instead of using that newfound wealth and power to further the proletarian cause, we transformed into the debt ridden consumer lackeys that we have today. We ate up the American exceptionalism propaganda that was fed to us, turned to the  impoverished workers of the undeveloped world and told them \"Fuck you, I got mine,\" We spewed out relative whispers of dissent if our states interfered with other governments, but deep down we knew that the inexpensive commodities imperialism yielded us is what paid for our lifestyles. \n\nIt's been this way ever since. The members in my unions are reactionary as fuck. Our executive has been pushing for indigenous, woman, LGBT, etc. representation, but a majority of members are complaining about how they need to \"go back to representing the true interests of it's members.\" Which is basically the interests of the white guys. \n_________________________________________________\n\nI'm terrible at monologues, but I really want to speak to other communists about this issue as it's sorta ripping my mind apart.

Now that the almighty white proletarians are under the boot again, lets get this revolution thing going.\" It just reeks of supremacy, like we're the ones who decide when the world changes. I'm afraid that the societies which take our place (Asia most likely) won't accept it. They'll remember the sweatshops, the toppled governments, the mass murders and devastated ecosystems. All to provide us with the frivolous bullshit that we cherish today. \n\nWe enslave thousands of people in South Asia because we don't feel like shelling the shrimp for our seafood rings.

Bit of a delayed realization on my part, to be sure, but I really am having difficulty understanding this. So these machines pop up, seemingly to the benefit of nobody. The consumer certainly doesn\u2019t benefit as I\u2019ve waited an equal amount of time in lines for both actual humans and these self-checkout kiosks, in addition I\u2019ve yet to hear of anybody using one and receiving a paycheck from the supermarket for doing what is ostensibly somebody\u2019s job, like people are paid to do that and consumers just do it for free? The employee most certainly does not benefit. I\u2019m having some difficulty understanding how this happened without any kind of protest (or at least without any I\u2019m aware of) or strike. Like it wasn\u2019t bad enough that we\u2019re expected to compete with our colleagues at work but now we\u2019re supposed to, as consumers, compete with the employees of whatever store we\u2019re picking up the groceries in? It just seems like such a blatant violation of both the consumer (who, when utilizing self-checkout, is necessarily an unpaid employee of the store) and of the actual paid worker in the store, for the companies to invest money in these machines that could have been put to much better use in paying the employees? \n\nApologies, comrades, if that was a little rant-y, it just really chaps my ass to see this sort of thing happening. So, yeah, I figured y\u2019all might know the answer to my questions or better yet, provide sources on protests against this that *did* happen and maybe were just blacklisted by most media.\n\n(Also, afaik this post is following all the sub\u2019s rules but if it isn\u2019t, just lemme know and I\u2019ll reupload it to the correct sub and take this one down.)\n\nThanks, comrades.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Why didn\u2019t supermarket employees strike at the introduction of self-checkout phantom labor?

This argument often refers to this [Source](http:\/\/www.struggle.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/ussr-economic-miracle-gdp-per-capita-1928-to-1970.png) but this plot only cares about the time from 1928 to 1970.\n\nThe reason why we disregard data from 1970 onward is because by that point the USSR had basically reverted to a capitalist economy. In 1965 the Kosygin reforms decentralized and privatized the economy which coincided with the economic stagnation.\n\n&gt;If you take the timespan from 1928 to 1989 South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Portugal, Finland, Singapore, Italy, Norway, and Thailand grew faster than the USSR.\n\nAll of those countries benefited from the US bankrolling them via the Marshall Plan. One must remember that the USSR's economy was negatively affected by isolation, war damage and funding socialist countries across the globe. Furthermore, the USSR didn't benefit from the imperialist exploitation of the third world in the same way that the west did.\n\n&gt;0% Unemployment  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Semi-Wrong**. There was unemployment but what they did when the unemployment was to high was that \"employers would rather cut salaries, reduce working hours and give staff unpaid holidays, reminiscient of Soviet-era tactics when unemployment was all but outlawed and masking the true state of the labour market.\"\n\nOnce again, this person uses evidence from the 1970s and 80s period to justify this claim, i.e when the economy had largely been reverted to capitalism and enterprises operated according to the profit motive. During the Stalin era, the USSR quite literally had NEGATIVE unemployment, tens of thousands of westerners emigrated during the industrialization, whilst their own countries were stuck in the middle of the Great Depression.  Also, lowering people's salaries in order to eradicate unemployment is better than having mass unemployment in the first place, as is the case increasingly in capitalist countries. Finally, not only was unemployment in the USSR completely minuscule and based entirely on anecdotal evidence, most if not all of it was frictional unemployment (moving between jobs). This is an important distinction, because it differs significantly from the mass unemployment in the west where there simply aren't enough jobs in the first place.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, it is misleading because being unemployed was a crime in the USSR that would lead to imprisonment.\n\nMandatory employment is better than involuntary unemployment.\n\n&gt;0% Homelessness  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Wrong**. [Source](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/4ljfhy\/were_there_homeless_people_in_the_ussr\/d3ofuqb)\n\nThis person even admits that homelessness was eradicated under Kruschev, but then refutes it by saying that the housing was \"unsatisfactory\", so basically cramped and of low quality. Well, by the standards of the west, he's probably right. But by the standards of the rest of the world? I'm sure people in Africa and Latin America would be more than satisfied by the Soviet living conditions. This is kinda the point, I'm not interested in comparing the living standards of socialist countries to the west, because it's quite obvious that the rest of the world could never be as rich as them. This person then goes on to reference the 1970s and 80s capitalist era AGAIN, I don't think I need to keep explaining why that's not a good argument, not to mention that whatever anecdotal evidence of homelessness in the Soviet Union these people find is still miniscule compared to most capitalist countries. Finally, it's also worth mentioning that 50% of Soviet homes were burnt to the ground during WWII.\n\n&gt;saved the world from Nazi Germany  \n&gt;  \n&gt;... after allying with Hitler and invading Poland, Finland, and the Baltics.\n\nWhat a shit deflection. First of all, \"allying with Hitler\" doesn't change the fact that the Soviets DID indeed save the world from Nazi Germany, it's an indisputable fact, 80-90% of Nazi casualties were inflicted on the Eastern Front. Secondly, he didn't ally with Hitler, that's just blatantly untrue, he signed a non-aggression pact with the Nazis after every other country in Europe had already done the same. Were Britain and France therefore allies of Hitler? NO! If anything, by your own logic, Britain were more of an ally to Hitler than the Soviet Union were, since they let the Nazis take Austria, Czechoslovakia and West Poland before they decided to step in. By the way, the Soviets only signed the pact with Hitler AS A LAST RESORT, they'd already attempted to form an anti-fascist alliance with Britain and France FOR YEARS. In fact, the Soviets were the only ones who even bothered to help prevent the spread of fascism, sending supplies to Republican Spain and Nationalist China when no-one else did. Here's a little history lesson. Right before Stalin signed the pact with Hitler, he offered to send one million troops through Poland to the German border, IF Britain and France ALSO attacked Germany from the west. Guess what happened? Britain, France and Poland all refused the offer because they hated communism just as much as Nazism, they wanted Germany and the Soviet Union to destroy each other before they stepped in. Hence, the US and UK delayed the opening of a second front for 3 years, at which point the Red Army had suffered millions of casualties. Harry Truman even said so himself that \"if Germany are winning, we will help Russia, if Russia are winning, we will help Germany, let them destroy each other\". Now, at this point, step into the shoes of the Soviets. They had no allies, they'd only began their industrialization a decade earlier, and they were completely unprepared for a conflict with the Nazis, who they assumed could attack them at any moment. Given all of this, the pact with Hitler was basically the only option left. Those 2 extra years out of conflict gave them time to organize and prepare the army, finish industrializing, and most importantly, evacuate all the factories to Siberia. The Red Army was, undoubtedly, completely unprepared in 1939, all you have to do is look at the Winter War, where the Finns killed the Soviets at a 10:1 ratio, to see this. Had the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union in 1939, it is likely Hitler would\u2019ve won. In regards to the Soviets annexing Eastern Poland, Finland and the Baltics, they had justifiable reasons for doing so. Not only did it create a buffer between the Nazis, it also meant that millions of Jews in these countries escaped Nazi persecution.\n\n&gt;invented space travel  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**True**. I have to add that they did that because of military purposes.\n\nNot an argument, I could say the same about the iPhone, which was mostly developed in the state sector with several key components developed by the US military, but I guess that would debunk the glorious innovation of the free market, lol.\n\n&gt;End the centuries-long cycle of famine in Eastern Europe  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**True**. There were famines until 1947.\n\nReferring to the 1947 famine is extremely disingenuous, considering that particular famine was caused almost entirely by war damage. The Soviet Union ended the cycle of famine by 1934, and at that point collectivization had doubled grain production, with enough of it in state emergency reserves to feed the country for two years in the event of another shortage.\n\n&gt;higher daily caloric consumption than the USA  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Wrong**.\n\nI don\u2019t really have anything to add here, this person is claiming that the FAO inflated Soviet data, whether or not that\u2019s true, I don\u2019t know. Either way, it\u2019s quite clear that the average citizen in the Eastern Bloc was not struggling for food, as the dishonest bourgeois narrative claims. I will say that comparing the Soviet Union, an isolated war-torn country, to the US, arguably the largest global economic empire in world history, is not exactly fair.\n\n&gt;End racial inequality  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Wrong**. [Source](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Racism_in_the_Soviet_Union)\n\nLol, a fucking Wikipedia article which cites Robert fucking Conquest of all people, how pathetic. The USSR guaranteed equality of political power for all ethnicities via the Soviet of Nationalities. Furthermore, many African Americans actually defected to the Soviet Union in order to gain greater civil rights. Paul Robeson, a black American and the voice for the English version of the USSR anthem, said that the first time he stepped on Soviet soil, was the first time he felt like a \u201cfull human being\u201d. In regards to the Wikipedia article and its list of supposed \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d in the Soviet Union, it refers to the Holodomor famine (bullshit Nazi propaganda myth), various NKVD operations during the Great Purge (committed by Yezhov, who was later executed for his crimes, behind Stalin\u2019s back), persecution of Jews (zero evidence whatsoever that this was motivated by anti-Semitic intent) and mass deportations during WWII (committed for non-racial reasons in order to evacuate civilians from the warzone, and because various groups were found guilty of collaborating with the Nazis). It\u2019s worth mentioning that several countries carried out deportations during WWII, namely America who put 100,000 Japanese-American citizens into literal concentration camps. The deported ethnicities in the Soviet Union weren\u2019t jailed or shot, they were resettled, there\u2019s a big difference.\n\n&gt;End gender inequality  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This **depends** on what they mean with gender inequality\n\nNot an argument. Fact of the matter is that women\u2019s rights in the Soviet Union were significantly more advanced than the rest of the world. I guess you can point to the criminalization of abortion under Stalin, that\u2019s a legitimate argument, but this ban was lifted in 1955 and regardless, Soviet Union were the first country to allow abortion in all circumstances.\n\n&gt;free education at all levels  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**True**. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean that the education was as good as the western education.\n\nHe provides absolutely zero evidence for this claim whatsoever. Although I don't know anything specifically about Soviet education, I do know that education in communist countries is generally better anyway. For example, Cuba is praised for having the best medical schools in the world, and there are currently 20,000 international students from all over the world enrolled at the Latin American School of Medicine. Furthermore, in post-WWII Germany, millions of West Germans got their higher education in the east before emigrating to the west in search of higher salaries.\n\n&gt;99% literacy rate  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**True** and the former USSR republics still have high literacy rates despite capitalism.\n\nOK, and? The literacy rate still went down after capitalist restoration, and historically communist countries have always had higher literacy rates than the rest of the world.\n\n&gt;Most doctors per capita in the world  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**True**. \"In 1985, during the Soviet era, there were 3.9 doctors for every 1,000 people. In the same year in the U.S., there were 1.7, while in Japan the figure was 1.5. \" but the **healthcare wasn't always free**: \"Also contrary to its design, Soviet health care is not free. Patients treated in the public system are often required to pay doctors and nurses under the table in order to assure that medications be administered or that an operation be performed. A Soviet newspaper recently published some sample \u201cprices\u201d: 500 rubles for an operation or delivery (the average monthly salary in the USSR is 200 rubles), 300 rubles for a 20-day hospital stay, 25 rubles or the donation of a unit of blood by a relative to assure admission to the hospital.  Most patients must purchase medications and appliances at prices that include \u201csurcharges\u201d demanded by sellers who manage to overcome bureaucratic obstacles and short supplies. \" [Source](https:\/\/nintil.com\/2016\/03\/29\/the-soviet-union-healthcare)\n\nI can\u2019t comment on how accurate this source is, but FOR THE ONE MILLIONTH FUCKING TIME, this person is cherry-picking information from the 1980s period of capitalist reform.\n\n&gt;Eliminated poverty  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Wrong**. \"The USSR managed to reduce inequality and poverty with respect to pre-revolutionary times, and it did deliver in bringing a level of equality comparable to that of Nordic countries. However, it wasn\u2019t successful in eliminating poverty, inequalities between republics, differences between the urban and rural areas, and even the \u2018distinctions between physical and mental work\u2019. \" [Source](https:\/\/nintil.com\/2017\/03\/14\/the-soviet-union-poverty-and-inequality)\n\nSo basically they didn\u2019t achieve full communism, which no-one denies. The USSR eliminated poverty in the sense that everyone was provided with their basic needs, this is an undeniable fact. I should also mention that this person has used the same source twice in a row, and, imagine my shock, he\u2019s used data exclusively from the 1970s.\n\n&gt;1991 Switch to Capitalism  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In my opinion, the time after the USSR can be divided into two epochs: The transition from 1991-1999 and the time after that. Pro-USSR people only look at the transition phase in which capital was leaving the country en masse, [with close to $150 billion worth flowing out between 1992 and 1999](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/investing\/012116\/russian-economy-collapse-soviet-union.asp). Things really became worse at that time but after the world saw that the former USSR wouldn't become socialist again, capital was [going into the former USSR states](https:\/\/static.businessinsider.com\/image\/4eaf0d346bb3f7f10900000e\/image.jpg) and everything became better than at the time of the USSR. Life expectancy grew by 10 years within 20 years while it nearly stagnated in the USSR since the late 1960s ([Source](https:\/\/en.actualitix.com\/chart\/est\/estonia-life-expectancy-at-birth.png)). GDP PC grew exponentially ([Source](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Economy_of_the_Soviet_Union#\/media\/File:FormerUSSRRepublicsGDPPC.svg)). etc etc\n\nSo basically he\u2019s admitted that capitalist Russia only improved after they switched from being a victim of imperialism, to themselves becoming an imperialist power coupled with tons of foreign investment, therefore it isn\u2019t a fair comparison. This is the same reason why socialists aren\u2019t interested in comparing the wealth of socialist countries with that of the capitalist west. Furthermore, claiming that \u201ceverything became better than at the time of the USSR\u201d based on GDP statistics is extremely erroneous. Why do the vast majority of former Soviet citizens say that they lived better under socialism? GDP means nothing when the vast majority of the money is in the hands of the 1%.\n\nThe rest of the post is basically attempting to refute pro-USSR statistics by citing Wikipedia, not worth my time\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend everyone to stay away from that sub, it's nothing but low-effort bullshit","subreddit":"communism","title":"Response to Anti-Soviet Claims on r\/CapitalismVSocialism"}

{"author":"VirtualPersimmon","created_utc":1533838990,"num_comments":20,"score":63,"selftext":"I was tired of having to debate this on platforms that couldn't allow long messages, so I decided to make my essay here. There will be common arguments answered at the bottom. I know most communists are okay with punching Nazis, so this is aimed to new comrades and those who don't want violence in the streets.\n\nSuddenly it occurs to me that this could be construed as inciting violence. I am not, I am only making the philosophical argument for not punishing such an act.\n\n##Why it is not reprehensible to punch fascists\n\n###What fascism really is\n\nThe purpose of this essay is not to explain fascism thoroughly, there are several good articles on the web already. What you need to know is that fascism promotes a certain social order that claims to put its people first, but only if they act as the State wants them to act (the social order is also traditionalist and based on false observations, but that's another topic). To that end, nothing is off limits to the fascists.\n\nEveryone not behaving correctly can and will be killed. Understandably, this includes minorities. Racial minorities but also religions, sexual orientations, ill and disabled people are targeted too because, to the fascists, they cannot be part of the new social order. This is a very real component of fascism, because fascism is not democratic and does not care for personal freedoms. It is impossible to convince the masses to abandon their freedoms and democracy and give it all to a totalitarian dictator. However, if you blame minorities for the troubles of the country, it becomes increasingly easier to justify the need for someone to \"put things back in order\".\n\nIt would be also be impossible to convince non-fascists to outright kill minorities in the early stages of a fascist presence. People do not want to commit genocide just like that. This is why such minorities are first vilified and you'll sometimes hear fascists say that they should be deported, or, as tolerant as fascists can be, that they shouldn't be systematically persecuted (make no mistake, fascists will still individually persecute minorities even if the State does not). In truth, the end goal is always to get rid of undesirables. Mussolini did not believe Hitler's racial purity rhetoric because Northern Italians were white but Southern Italians were not (which highlights the artificiality of race), but that did not prevent him from persecuting Slovenes.\n\nOne is only tolerated by the so-called social order until they are no longer useful. During the night of the long knives, Hitler got rid of many fellow Nazis who helped secure his victory. George Strasser, a \"left-wing\" Nazi who helped organize strikes and unions, was killed then and there. R\u00f6hm, the leader of the SA, was also purged. He was homosexual, which was punished in the Third Reich, but the whole of the SA was purged alongside him. Therefore, even good fascists that fulfil their duty to the nation will be killed if they step out of line. Minorities have it worse in that their killing is systematic, i.e. not based on individual acts but simply on the act of existing.\n\nTherefore, fascism is an abhorrent ideology that truly wants to kill people. It is impossible to play on words, it is impossible to say that things will be different \"this time\". Fascism requires this component of vilifying a common enemy, of calling back to a great time in the nation's history. If you talk to fascists, you'll see they all think very poorly of at least certain minorities, if not any person who doesn't look and think like them.\n\nThis is also why fascists are not a caricature. If you keep looking for the fascist that is a supremacist, racist against everyone else, and wants to kill all minorities that don't conform to his narrow view, you will never find him. What you will find however are fascists who call people degenerates for being homosexual or transgender, who want an ethnostate (a country with only people of one skin colour, which does not exist anywhere), and who want to deport minorities because they cause issues.\n\n**We must stop seeing fascism as this narrow ideology that must absolutely conform to all of several criteria.** Anyone who has fascist tendencies is at risk of becoming fully fascist, and at risk of rallying actual fascists.\n\n###Debating fascists is a waste of time\n\nThe alternative to outright being hostile (not necessarily violently) to fascists is debating them, publicly, and tearing down their arguments. Since the end of WW2, there have been no new arguments in favour of fascism. All of them have already been debunked. What exactly do you want to debate?\n\nFascists don't care about debating. Anyone who holds beliefs this strongly are not open to having their mind changed by a debate. Sartre said it himself in a famous quote:\n\n&gt; Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.\n\nIn essence, the fascist does not care about arguments. His ideology is not based in rational facts and logic, it is based on blind hate. You are wasting time, hours of your day, to make a point that everyone already knows is true. The burden of proof is not on the fascist, he will point in the general direction of a societal issue, say \"look at what's happening\" and that's his whole argument. You will have to collect statistics, you will have to read articles, you will have to be careful with your words. If you say a slur in your argumentation, even by mistake and even if the rest of your argument is solid, the fascist will jump on it and say that even you use slurs, therefore you shouldn't prevent them from using slurs either.\n\nBy debating their hatred, **minorities have to prove their humanity**. You cannot ask a minority to debate a fascist openly, for the fascist wants them to die. By debating fascists, you are giving them a public platform to spread their ideas and you are legitimizing their views. If you invite a fascist to a public debate, you are saying to him \"what you have to say is interesting, please tell us about it\". Whereas denying them their platform sends a clear message: you are not welcome here, renounce your views.\n\nWhat good will be your arguments when the fascists take power? You will be the first purged because you are opposition. Would you go up to Hitler during his election speech and tell him he is wrong? It is already too late.\n\n###Violence is not the first answer\n\nThe common argument for debating fascists is that we are in a civilized society and violence is brutish. We are better than savages and solve our issues by talking. This is a paradox, because fascists will strip away your civilised society. They want to kill people, therefore they are violent. They will destroy democracy and free speech, therefore they do not believe in it, yet they use it (Richard Spencer for one admitted to this). They may not be violent _now_, and they may not want to destroy democracy _now_, but it is in their aim -- as I argued in the first chapter.\n\nWith that said, violence should not be the first option one jumps to when confronting a fascist. Violence is a tool to tell them once and for all that their hatred is not tolerated in a civilised society. This violence exists to protect peace.\n\nDo _you_ have to punch Nazis? No. You don't have to put yourself in danger either. But you should openly oppose fascism through all means that you are comfortable with. To ignore fascism (as a reporter urged people to do in Portland last Saturday, for example) is to give it the conditions to flourish. If no one shows up to counter their rallies and they all spend an afternoon in the park, it sends the message that fascism is allowed just like your picnics in the park are.\n\nThere exist limits to free speech everywhere and some ideas are not allowed. Some groups have to fight for recognition too, such as homosexuals who had to prove their humanity, to say gently, and still have to today. But homosexuals do not want to kill people for being heterosexual. They do not hate heterosexual couples on the basis of their sexual orientation. They do not want to outlaw heterosexual marriage and make a nation only for themselves.\n\nYet, fascism is not outlawed in public. Until it is, it falls into the hands of the people to do what the police will not do.\n\nDoes the possibility of abuse exists? Yes, but it exists everywhere. Courts often sentence innocent people to death all around the world. Disregarding current and historical events, my argument is that **violence should be reserved when all else fails, in self-defence, and only in a proportionate amount**. Debating, as we know, is already a failed strategy. Violence however does not mean to kill. It does not mean to gang up on a person on the ground (which fascists did not long ago, there is video evidence). It does not mean using a gun against fists. It means, literally, to be violent.\n\nIf we want to answer the question \"who should violence be reserved to?\", it is simply **for those who would, given the chance, kill another human being or make their life unbearable on the basis of their identity**. As was said in [The philosophy of Antifa](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bgwS_FMZ3nQ), if you are a fascist, you can renounce your beliefs and stop being a target. But if you are a minority, the target of fascists, you cannot renounce anything. You cannot stop being black, you cannot stop being Jewish. You will never be acceptable enough that they will leave you alone.\n\n##Common counter-arguments\n\n(all of which I have heard)\n\n&gt; If you punch nazis, how long until you punch anyone you don't agree with?\n\nAbuse can exist everywhere and it is not proven that this particular context attracts more abuse. Still, violence should only be used against those who want to kill people for their identity. Believe me, fascists would punch you personally if they had the impunity to do so.\n\n&gt; This person only said that women should make babies and cook, does that mean I should punch them?\n\nNo. You should, if you are in a position to, take the chance to ridicule them for their regressive views and not just shrug and move on.\n\n&gt; Antifa are the real fascists!\n\nFascism has a definition. Being violent is not being a fascist. In that case, all armies are fascist, even the soldiers who fought against fascism.\n\n&gt;But people who punch fascists are hypocrites because they don't want to be punched back!\n\nThey know the risks. They understand that they may be punched or killed in return. Which is why you shouldn't start being violent if you are not comfortable with violence! We are okay with that.\n\n&gt; All speech should be free, I disagree with limiting any form of speech.\n\nFascists want to remove free speech. One shouldn't be allowed to abuse free speech to promote the destruction of free speech.\n\n&gt; Therefore, one shouldn't be able to use violence to promote the end of violence?\n\nSelf-defence is a right that must be upheld. In the strictest sense, one is allowed to be violent towards an imminent violent threat. In a broader sense, it is justified to be violent against people who would be violent against you or people you know. The response is proportional to the threat. Just like conspiring to murder is a crime, conspiring to persecute minorities should be dealt with.\n\n&gt; Would you target a black\/Jewish\/etc fascist?\n\nThis one tries to show the hypocrisy of wanting to protect minorities while targeting minorities. Anyone who espouses fascist views should be stopped. Their skin colour, religion or other trait doesn't matter. There was an argument because a black member of TPUSA was targeted recently, with people saying that the anti-racist liberals are now targeting black people. Firstly, there are different groups on the left and not all of them defend minorities through and through. It doesn't make a difference what the slave master looks like to the slave being abused.\n\n&gt; In public rallies, they don't talk about white supremacy or anything like that.\n\nThey know nobody would take them seriously. They start by talking about the \"great displacement\", or how things were better when there were less immigrants, then people are more ready to listen. Hitler didn't start by saying \"we should kill people for the glory of Germany\". It was a gradual shift of public perception that started at ostracising and segregating minorities.\n\nAdditionally, there is evidence that many of those protesters have fascist ties, such as swastika tattoos or later being identified to their social media accounts and finding supremacist messages.\n\n&gt; Fascists have no power, they only have small numbers, what's the big deal?\n\nVote for them then, if they're not dangerous. If left unchecked, they will grow bolder and eventually you will have no choice on the ballot but to vote for one. Should we start organizing resistance only then?\n\n&gt; Communists want to kill people too, you're not any better\n\nWe want to kill the concept of the bourgeoisie. Individuals are not targeted by communists (but individuals are targeted by racially-motivated murderers today). It is not in our ideology to get rid of people (through death, deportation, whatever), but we understand that the bourgeoisie will never willingly surrender their assets. Those who accept our demands will be left alone. As I wrote at the end of the essay, you will never be white enough for the supremacist. You will never be Christian enough. If you agreed to renounce your Slovene citizenship and become Italian, you would never be Italian enough. You would still be \"tainted\" by being Slovene. But if you are bourgeois, or the target of communists, you can accept to surrender everything and join the proletariat in the new society. This is what separates us from fascists.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Why it is not reprehensible to punch fascists"}

This argument often refers to this [Source](http:\/\/www.struggle.pk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/ussr-economic-miracle-gdp-per-capita-1928-to-1970.png) but this plot only cares about the time from 1928 to 1970.\n\nThe reason why we disregard data from 1970 onward is because by that point the USSR had basically reverted to a capitalist economy. In 1965 the Kosygin reforms decentralized and privatized the economy which coincided with the economic stagnation.\n\n&gt;If you take the timespan from 1928 to 1989 South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Portugal, Finland, Singapore, Italy, Norway, and Thailand grew faster than the USSR.\n\nAll of those countries benefited from the US bankrolling them via the Marshall Plan. One must remember that the USSR's economy was negatively affected by isolation, war damage and funding socialist countries across the globe. Furthermore, the USSR didn't benefit from the imperialist exploitation of the third world in the same way that the west did.\n\n&gt;0% Unemployment  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Semi-Wrong**. There was unemployment but what they did when the unemployment was to high was that \"employers would rather cut salaries, reduce working hours and give staff unpaid holidays, reminiscient of Soviet-era tactics when unemployment was all but outlawed and masking the true state of the labour market.\"\n\nOnce again, this person uses evidence from the 1970s and 80s period to justify this claim, i.e when the economy had largely been reverted to capitalism and enterprises operated according to the profit motive. During the Stalin era, the USSR quite literally had NEGATIVE unemployment, tens of thousands of westerners emigrated during the industrialization, whilst their own countries were stuck in the middle of the Great Depression.  Also, lowering people's salaries in order to eradicate unemployment is better than having mass unemployment in the first place, as is the case increasingly in capitalist countries. Finally, not only was unemployment in the USSR completely minuscule and based entirely on anecdotal evidence, most if not all of it was frictional unemployment (moving between jobs). This is an important distinction, because it differs significantly from the mass unemployment in the west where there simply aren't enough jobs in the first place.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, it is misleading because being unemployed was a crime in the USSR that would lead to imprisonment.\n\nMandatory employment is better than involuntary unemployment.\n\n&gt;0% Homelessness  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Wrong**. [Source](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/AskHistorians\/comments\/4ljfhy\/were_there_homeless_people_in_the_ussr\/d3ofuqb)\n\nThis person even admits that homelessness was eradicated under Kruschev, but then refutes it by saying that the housing was \"unsatisfactory\", so basically cramped and of low quality. Well, by the standards of the west, he's probably right. But by the standards of the rest of the world? I'm sure people in Africa and Latin America would be more than satisfied by the Soviet living conditions. This is kinda the point, I'm not interested in comparing the living standards of socialist countries to the west, because it's quite obvious that the rest of the world could never be as rich as them. This person then goes on to reference the 1970s and 80s capitalist era AGAIN, I don't think I need to keep explaining why that's not a good argument, not to mention that whatever anecdotal evidence of homelessness in the Soviet Union these people find is still miniscule compared to most capitalist countries. Finally, it's also worth mentioning that 50% of Soviet homes were burnt to the ground during WWII.\n\n&gt;saved the world from Nazi Germany  \n&gt;  \n&gt;... after allying with Hitler and invading Poland, Finland, and the Baltics.\n\nWhat a shit deflection. First of all, \"allying with Hitler\" doesn't change the fact that the Soviets DID indeed save the world from Nazi Germany, it's an indisputable fact, 80-90% of Nazi casualties were inflicted on the Eastern Front. Secondly, he didn't ally with Hitler, that's just blatantly untrue, he signed a non-aggression pact with the Nazis after every other country in Europe had already done the same. Were Britain and France therefore allies of Hitler? NO! If anything, by your own logic, Britain were more of an ally to Hitler than the Soviet Union were, since they let the Nazis take Austria, Czechoslovakia and West Poland before they decided to step in. By the way, the Soviets only signed the pact with Hitler AS A LAST RESORT, they'd already attempted to form an anti-fascist alliance with Britain and France FOR YEARS. In fact, the Soviets were the only ones who even bothered to help prevent the spread of fascism, sending supplies to Republican Spain and Nationalist China when no-one else did. Here's a little history lesson. Right before Stalin signed the pact with Hitler, he offered to send one million troops through Poland to the German border, IF Britain and France ALSO attacked Germany from the west. Guess what happened? Britain, France and Poland all refused the offer because they hated communism just as much as Nazism, they wanted Germany and the Soviet Union to destroy each other before they stepped in. Hence, the US and UK delayed the opening of a second front for 3 years, at which point the Red Army had suffered millions of casualties. Harry Truman even said so himself that \"if Germany are winning, we will help Russia, if Russia are winning, we will help Germany, let them destroy each other\". Now, at this point, step into the shoes of the Soviets. They had no allies, they'd only began their industrialization a decade earlier, and they were completely unprepared for a conflict with the Nazis, who they assumed could attack them at any moment. Given all of this, the pact with Hitler was basically the only option left. Those 2 extra years out of conflict gave them time to organize and prepare the army, finish industrializing, and most importantly, evacuate all the factories to Siberia. The Red Army was, undoubtedly, completely unprepared in 1939, all you have to do is look at the Winter War, where the Finns killed the Soviets at a 10:1 ratio, to see this. Had the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union in 1939, it is likely Hitler would\u2019ve won. In regards to the Soviets annexing Eastern Poland, Finland and the Baltics, they had justifiable reasons for doing so. Not only did it create a buffer between the Nazis, it also meant that millions of Jews in these countries escaped Nazi persecution.\n\n&gt;invented space travel  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**True**. I have to add that they did that because of military purposes.\n\nNot an argument, I could say the same about the iPhone, which was mostly developed in the state sector with several key components developed by the US military, but I guess that would debunk the glorious innovation of the free market, lol.\n\n&gt;End the centuries-long cycle of famine in Eastern Europe  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**True**. There were famines until 1947.\n\nReferring to the 1947 famine is extremely disingenuous, considering that particular famine was caused almost entirely by war damage. The Soviet Union ended the cycle of famine by 1934, and at that point collectivization had doubled grain production, with enough of it in state emergency reserves to feed the country for two years in the event of another shortage.\n\n&gt;higher daily caloric consumption than the USA  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Wrong**.\n\nI don\u2019t really have anything to add here, this person is claiming that the FAO inflated Soviet data, whether or not that\u2019s true, I don\u2019t know. Either way, it\u2019s quite clear that the average citizen in the Eastern Bloc was not struggling for food, as the dishonest bourgeois narrative claims. I will say that comparing the Soviet Union, an isolated war-torn country, to the US, arguably the largest global economic empire in world history, is not exactly fair.\n\n&gt;End racial inequality  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Wrong**. [Source](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Racism_in_the_Soviet_Union)\n\nLol, a fucking Wikipedia article which cites Robert fucking Conquest of all people, how pathetic. The USSR guaranteed equality of political power for all ethnicities via the Soviet of Nationalities. Furthermore, many African Americans actually defected to the Soviet Union in order to gain greater civil rights. Paul Robeson, a black American and the voice for the English version of the USSR anthem, said that the first time he stepped on Soviet soil, was the first time he felt like a \u201cfull human being\u201d. In regards to the Wikipedia article and its list of supposed \u201cethnic cleansing\u201d in the Soviet Union, it refers to the Holodomor famine (bullshit Nazi propaganda myth), various NKVD operations during the Great Purge (committed by Yezhov, who was later executed for his crimes, behind Stalin\u2019s back), persecution of Jews (zero evidence whatsoever that this was motivated by anti-Semitic intent) and mass deportations during WWII (committed for non-racial reasons in order to evacuate civilians from the warzone, and because various groups were found guilty of collaborating with the Nazis). It\u2019s worth mentioning that several countries carried out deportations during WWII, namely America who put 100,000 Japanese-American citizens into literal concentration camps. The deported ethnicities in the Soviet Union weren\u2019t jailed or shot, they were resettled, there\u2019s a big difference.\n\n&gt;End gender inequality  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This **depends** on what they mean with gender inequality\n\nNot an argument. Fact of the matter is that women\u2019s rights in the Soviet Union were significantly more advanced than the rest of the world. I guess you can point to the criminalization of abortion under Stalin, that\u2019s a legitimate argument, but this ban was lifted in 1955 and regardless, Soviet Union were the first country to allow abortion in all circumstances.\n\n&gt;free education at all levels  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**True**. Nevertheless, that doesn't mean that the education was as good as the western education.\n\nHe provides absolutely zero evidence for this claim whatsoever. Although I don't know anything specifically about Soviet education, I do know that education in communist countries is generally better anyway. For example, Cuba is praised for having the best medical schools in the world, and there are currently 20,000 international students from all over the world enrolled at the Latin American School of Medicine. Furthermore, in post-WWII Germany, millions of West Germans got their higher education in the east before emigrating to the west in search of higher salaries.\n\n&gt;99% literacy rate  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**True** and the former USSR republics still have high literacy rates despite capitalism.\n\nOK, and? The literacy rate still went down after capitalist restoration, and historically communist countries have always had higher literacy rates than the rest of the world.\n\n&gt;Most doctors per capita in the world  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**True**. \"In 1985, during the Soviet era, there were 3.9 doctors for every 1,000 people. In the same year in the U.S., there were 1.7, while in Japan the figure was 1.5. \" but the **healthcare wasn't always free**: \"Also contrary to its design, Soviet health care is not free. Patients treated in the public system are often required to pay doctors and nurses under the table in order to assure that medications be administered or that an operation be performed. A Soviet newspaper recently published some sample \u201cprices\u201d: 500 rubles for an operation or delivery (the average monthly salary in the USSR is 200 rubles), 300 rubles for a 20-day hospital stay, 25 rubles or the donation of a unit of blood by a relative to assure admission to the hospital.  Most patients must purchase medications and appliances at prices that include \u201csurcharges\u201d demanded by sellers who manage to overcome bureaucratic obstacles and short supplies. \" [Source](https:\/\/nintil.com\/2016\/03\/29\/the-soviet-union-healthcare)\n\nI can\u2019t comment on how accurate this source is, but FOR THE ONE MILLIONTH FUCKING TIME, this person is cherry-picking information from the 1980s period of capitalist reform.\n\n&gt;Eliminated poverty  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Wrong**. \"The USSR managed to reduce inequality and poverty with respect to pre-revolutionary times, and it did deliver in bringing a level of equality comparable to that of Nordic countries. However, it wasn\u2019t successful in eliminating poverty, inequalities between republics, differences between the urban and rural areas, and even the \u2018distinctions between physical and mental work\u2019. \" [Source](https:\/\/nintil.com\/2017\/03\/14\/the-soviet-union-poverty-and-inequality)\n\nSo basically they didn\u2019t achieve full communism, which no-one denies. The USSR eliminated poverty in the sense that everyone was provided with their basic needs, this is an undeniable fact. I should also mention that this person has used the same source twice in a row, and, imagine my shock, he\u2019s used data exclusively from the 1970s.\n\n&gt;1991 Switch to Capitalism  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In my opinion, the time after the USSR can be divided into two epochs: The transition from 1991-1999 and the time after that. Pro-USSR people only look at the transition phase in which capital was leaving the country en masse, [with close to $150 billion worth flowing out between 1992 and 1999](https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/investing\/012116\/russian-economy-collapse-soviet-union.asp). Things really became worse at that time but after the world saw that the former USSR wouldn't become socialist again, capital was [going into the former USSR states](https:\/\/static.businessinsider.com\/image\/4eaf0d346bb3f7f10900000e\/image.jpg) and everything became better than at the time of the USSR. Life expectancy grew by 10 years within 20 years while it nearly stagnated in the USSR since the late 1960s ([Source](https:\/\/en.actualitix.com\/chart\/est\/estonia-life-expectancy-at-birth.png)). GDP PC grew exponentially ([Source](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Economy_of_the_Soviet_Union#\/media\/File:FormerUSSRRepublicsGDPPC.svg)). etc etc\n\nSo basically he\u2019s admitted that capitalist Russia only improved after they switched from being a victim of imperialism, to themselves becoming an imperialist power coupled with tons of foreign investment, therefore it isn\u2019t a fair comparison. This is the same reason why socialists aren\u2019t interested in comparing the wealth of socialist countries with that of the capitalist west. Furthermore, claiming that \u201ceverything became better than at the time of the USSR\u201d based on GDP statistics is extremely erroneous. Why do the vast majority of former Soviet citizens say that they lived better under socialism? GDP means nothing when the vast majority of the money is in the hands of the 1%.\n\nThe rest of the post is basically attempting to refute pro-USSR statistics by citing Wikipedia, not worth my time\n\nIn conclusion, I recommend everyone to stay away from that sub, it's nothing but low-effort bullshit","subreddit":"communism","title":"Response to Anti-Soviet Claims on r\/CapitalismVSocialism""num_comments":1,"score":3,"selftext":"","subreddit":"SocialismAndVeganism","title":"Response to Anti-Soviet Claims on r\/CapitalismVSocialism"}

There will be common arguments answered at the bottom. I know most communists are okay with punching Nazis, so this is aimed to new comrades and those who don't want violence in the streets.\n\nSuddenly it occurs to me that this could be construed as inciting violence. I am not, I am only making the philosophical argument for not punishing such an act.\n\n##Why it is not reprehensible to punch fascists\n\n###What fascism really is\n\nThe purpose of this essay is not to explain fascism thoroughly, there are several good articles on the web already. What you need to know is that fascism promotes a certain social order that claims to put its people first, but only if they act as the State wants them to act (the social order is also traditionalist and based on false observations, but that's another topic). To that end, nothing is off limits to the fascists.\n\nEveryone not behaving correctly can and will be killed. Understandably, this includes minorities. Racial minorities but also religions, sexual orientations, ill and disabled people are targeted too because, to the fascists, they cannot be part of the new social order. This is a very real component of fascism, because fascism is not democratic and does not care for personal freedoms. It is impossible to convince the masses to abandon their freedoms and democracy and give it all to a totalitarian dictator. However, if you blame minorities for the troubles of the country, it becomes increasingly easier to justify the need for someone to \"put things back in order\".\n\nIt would be also be impossible to convince non-fascists to outright kill minorities in the early stages of a fascist presence. People do not want to commit genocide just like that. This is why such minorities are first vilified and you'll sometimes hear fascists say that they should be deported, or, as tolerant as fascists can be, that they shouldn't be systematically persecuted (make no mistake, fascists will still individually persecute minorities even if the State does not). In truth, the end goal is always to get rid of undesirables. Mussolini did not believe Hitler's racial purity rhetoric because Northern Italians were white but Southern Italians were not (which highlights the artificiality of race), but that did not prevent him from persecuting Slovenes.\n\nOne is only tolerated by the so-called social order until they are no longer useful. During the night of the long knives, Hitler got rid of many fellow Nazis who helped secure his victory. George Strasser, a \"left-wing\" Nazi who helped organize strikes and unions, was killed then and there. R\u00f6hm, the leader of the SA, was also purged. He was homosexual, which was punished in the Third Reich, but the whole of the SA was purged alongside him. Therefore, even good fascists that fulfil their duty to the nation will be killed if they step out of line. Minorities have it worse in that their killing is systematic, i.e. not based on individual acts but simply on the act of existing.\n\nTherefore, fascism is an abhorrent ideology that truly wants to kill people. It is impossible to play on words, it is impossible to say that things will be different \"this time\". Fascism requires this component of vilifying a common enemy, of calling back to a great time in the nation's history. If you talk to fascists, you'll see they all think very poorly of at least certain minorities, if not any person who doesn't look and think like them.\n\nThis is also why fascists are not a caricature. If you keep looking for the fascist that is a supremacist, racist against everyone else, and wants to kill all minorities that don't conform to his narrow view, you will never find him. What you will find however are fascists who call people degenerates for being homosexual or transgender, who want an ethnostate (a country with only people of one skin colour, which does not exist anywhere), and who want to deport minorities because they cause issues.\n\n**We must stop seeing fascism as this narrow ideology that must absolutely conform to all of several criteria.** Anyone who has fascist tendencies is at risk of becoming fully fascist, and at risk of rallying actual fascists.\n\n###Debating fascists is a waste of time\n\nThe alternative to outright being hostile (not necessarily violently) to fascists is debating them, publicly, and tearing down their arguments. Since the end of WW2, there have been no new arguments in favour of fascism. All of them have already been debunked. What exactly do you want to debate?\n\nFascists don't care about debating. Anyone who holds beliefs this strongly are not open to having their mind changed by a debate. Sartre said it himself in a famous quote:\n\n&gt; Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.\n\nIn essence, the fascist does not care about arguments. His ideology is not based in rational facts and logic, it is based on blind hate. You are wasting time, hours of your day, to make a point that everyone already knows is true. The burden of proof is not on the fascist, he will point in the general direction of a societal issue, say \"look at what's happening\" and that's his whole argument. You will have to collect statistics, you will have to read articles, you will have to be careful with your words. If you say a slur in your argumentation, even by mistake and even if the rest of your argument is solid, the fascist will jump on it and say that even you use slurs, therefore you shouldn't prevent them from using slurs either.\n\nBy debating their hatred, **minorities have to prove their humanity**. You cannot ask a minority to debate a fascist openly, for the fascist wants them to die. By debating fascists, you are giving them a public platform to spread their ideas and you are legitimizing their views. If you invite a fascist to a public debate, you are saying to him \"what you have to say is interesting, please tell us about it\". Whereas denying them their platform sends a clear message: you are not welcome here, renounce your views.\n\nWhat good will be your arguments when the fascists take power? You will be the first purged because you are opposition. Would you go up to Hitler during his election speech and tell him he is wrong? It is already too late.\n\n###Violence is not the first answer\n\nThe common argument for debating fascists is that we are in a civilized society and violence is brutish. We are better than savages and solve our issues by talking. This is a paradox, because fascists will strip away your civilised society. They want to kill people, therefore they are violent. They will destroy democracy and free speech, therefore they do not believe in it, yet they use it (Richard Spencer for one admitted to this). They may not be violent _now_, and they may not want to destroy democracy _now_, but it is in their aim -- as I argued in the first chapter.\n\nWith that said, violence should not be the first option one jumps to when confronting a fascist. Violence is a tool to tell them once and for all that their hatred is not tolerated in a civilised society. This violence exists to protect peace.\n\nDo _you_ have to punch Nazis? No. You don't have to put yourself in danger either. But you should openly oppose fascism through all means that you are comfortable with. To ignore fascism (as a reporter urged people to do in Portland last Saturday, for example) is to give it the conditions to flourish. If no one shows up to counter their rallies and they all spend an afternoon in the park, it sends the message that fascism is allowed just like your picnics in the park are.\n\nThere exist limits to free speech everywhere and some ideas are not allowed. Some groups have to fight for recognition too, such as homosexuals who had to prove their humanity, to say gently, and still have to today. But homosexuals do not want to kill people for being heterosexual. They do not hate heterosexual couples on the basis of their sexual orientation. They do not want to outlaw heterosexual marriage and make a nation only for themselves.\n\nYet, fascism is not outlawed in public. Until it is, it falls into the hands of the people to do what the police will not do.\n\nDoes the possibility of abuse exists? Yes, but it exists everywhere. Courts often sentence innocent people to death all around the world. Disregarding current and historical events, my argument is that **violence should be reserved when all else fails, in self-defence, and only in a proportionate amount**. Debating, as we know, is already a failed strategy. Violence however does not mean to kill. It does not mean to gang up on a person on the ground (which fascists did not long ago, there is video evidence). It does not mean using a gun against fists. It means, literally, to be violent.\n\nIf we want to answer the question \"who should violence be reserved to?\", it is simply **for those who would, given the chance, kill another human being or make their life unbearable on the basis of their identity**. As was said in [The philosophy of Antifa](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bgwS_FMZ3nQ), if you are a fascist, you can renounce your beliefs and stop being a target. But if you are a minority, the target of fascists, you cannot renounce anything. You cannot stop being black, you cannot stop being Jewish. You will never be acceptable enough that they will leave you alone.\n\n##Common counter-arguments\n\n(all of which I have heard)\n\n&gt; If you punch nazis, how long until you punch anyone you don't agree with?\n\nAbuse can exist everywhere and it is not proven that this particular context attracts more abuse. Still, violence should only be used against those who want to kill people for their identity. Believe me, fascists would punch you personally if they had the impunity to do so.\n\n&gt; This person only said that women should make babies and cook, does that mean I should punch them?\n\nNo. You should, if you are in a position to, take the chance to ridicule them for their regressive views and not just shrug and move on.\n\n&gt; Antifa are the real fascists!\n\nFascism has a definition. Being violent is not being a fascist. In that case, all armies are fascist, even the soldiers who fought against fascism.\n\n&gt;But people who punch fascists are hypocrites because they don't want to be punched back!\n\nThey know the risks. They understand that they may be punched or killed in return. Which is why you shouldn't start being violent if you are not comfortable with violence! We are okay with that.\n\n&gt; All speech should be free, I disagree with limiting any form of speech.\n\nFascists want to remove free speech. One shouldn't be allowed to abuse free speech to promote the destruction of free speech.\n\n&gt; Therefore, one shouldn't be able to use violence to promote the end of violence?\n\nSelf-defence is a right that must be upheld. In the strictest sense, one is allowed to be violent towards an imminent violent threat. In a broader sense, it is justified to be violent against people who would be violent against you or people you know. The response is proportional to the threat. Just like conspiring to murder is a crime, conspiring to persecute minorities should be dealt with.\n\n&gt; Would you target a black\/Jewish\/etc fascist?\n\nThis one tries to show the hypocrisy of wanting to protect minorities while targeting minorities. Anyone who espouses fascist views should be stopped. Their skin colour, religion or other trait doesn't matter. There was an argument because a black member of TPUSA was targeted recently, with people saying that the anti-racist liberals are now targeting black people. Firstly, there are different groups on the left and not all of them defend minorities through and through. It doesn't make a difference what the slave master looks like to the slave being abused.\n\n&gt; In public rallies, they don't talk about white supremacy or anything like that.\n\nThey know nobody would take them seriously. They start by talking about the \"great displacement\", or how things were better when there were less immigrants, then people are more ready to listen. Hitler didn't start by saying \"we should kill people for the glory of Germany\". It was a gradual shift of public perception that started at ostracising and segregating minorities.\n\nAdditionally, there is evidence that many of those protesters have fascist ties, such as swastika tattoos or later being identified to their social media accounts and finding supremacist messages.\n\n&gt; Fascists have no power, they only have small numbers, what's the big deal?\n\nVote for them then, if they're not dangerous. If left unchecked, they will grow bolder and eventually you will have no choice on the ballot but to vote for one. Should we start organizing resistance only then?\n\n&gt; Communists want to kill people too, you're not any better\n\nWe want to kill the concept of the bourgeoisie. Individuals are not targeted by communists (but individuals are targeted by racially-motivated murderers today). It is not in our ideology to get rid of people (through death, deportation, whatever), but we understand that the bourgeoisie will never willingly surrender their assets. Those who accept our demands will be left alone. As I wrote at the end of the essay, you will never be white enough for the supremacist. You will never be Christian enough. If you agreed to renounce your Slovene citizenship and become Italian, you would never be Italian enough. You would still be \"tainted\" by being Slovene. But if you are bourgeois, or the target of communists, you can accept to surrender everything and join the proletariat in the new society. This is what separates us from fascists.","subreddit":"communism","title":"Why it is not reprehensible to punch fascists""num_comments":1,"score":5,"selftext":"","subreddit":"SocialismAndVeganism","title":"Why it is not reprehensible to punch fascists"}

As one contemporary writer put it:\n\n&gt;I have called it an artificial famine: that is to say, it was a famine which desolated a rich and fertile island that produced every year abundance and superabundance to sustain all her people and many more. The English, indeed, call the famine a \"dispensation of Providence\"; and ascribe it entirely to the blight on potatoes. But potatoes failed in like manner all over Europe; yet there was no famine save in Ireland. The British account of the matter, then, is first, a fraud; second, a blasphemy. The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the famine.\n\n^Thnx ^Wikipedia\n\nThere are very plausible charges that the potato disease was *deliberately capitalized upon* by England with the goal of depopulating the island, that English could more effectively exploit her colonial holding without the burden of having to deal with the locals.\n\nIt seems this incident bears striking resemblance to the accusations made of the Holomodor, yet when it's capitalist England doing the deliberate starvation thing, they get a pass.

Joe can no longer hear, see, taste, smell, talk, and on top of that he lost both his arms and legs. he basically just sits in a hospital bed and everyone around him thinks he is completely comatose. in reality Joe is conscious of everything, and the book just goes about him figuring out what had happened and where he is. \n\nthe book was written by Dalton Trumbo in 1938 as an anti-war novel. the whole book is filled with a lot of things that Trumbo is trying to say, but as i kept reading i noticed his approached seemed kind of marxist. so i looked up more on Trumbo and turns out he was a member of the american communist party, and one of the \"hollywood ten\". Dalton wrote the book in the social realist or socialist realist style, or in other words he wrote the book to focus on the struggles and troubles of the working class. the very strong message that Dalton pushed throughout the whole book is that the \"little guys\" (proletariat) fight wars for the \"big guys\" (bourgeois), and the \"little guys\" are never connected to the war, they gain nothing out of it, yet they are the ones who die. at one point in the book he describes it as a slave ship, the workers slave away in the depths of the ship rowing never knowing where they are rowing too as the bourgeois sit above in the sunlight steering the rowers to their demise. the very last page of the book Dalton cried for the \"little guys\" to take the guns they were given and take the patriotic slogans and to turn on the actual threat, the \"big guys\". \n\nim curious, have any comrades read this book before or seen the movie?

See you later, have fun.\"\n\nI did have fun. I felt the exhilaration of the crowd, and seeing huge numbers of people gave a feeing of power, which was a the thought that I was part of that, and my convictions and agency had a platform for working towards justice. \n\n-----------\n\nI know that side of my now as the 'Essentialist Me'. \n\nFor the 'Essentialist Me', emotions create their own meaning. What you want becomes reality. \n\nThe tech always went to the beach when essentialist me thought about activism. \n\nSo...la...la...la...   essentialist me had fun, but no analytic capacity.  \n\n-----\n\nThe essentialist me is rooted in an upright-moral-compass. \n\nI had intuitions that something was not synced from my first intro to NYC activists (mid-90's), but I had choice but to ignore that since Justice is what I wanted and still want, and so I had no choice but to go with the only game in town. \n\nSo...la...la...la...   essentialist me had fun, but no analytic capacity, and around leftists, I had assumed that I'd need to ignore the bullshit and focus on the work. \n\nThe Accumulation Monster showed-up. \n\nSo...la...la...la... accumulating bullshit became the main work, and there was no other work available but that category. \n\n\nThe Accumulation Monster accumulated bullshit, and I was overcome. \n\nThe Occupy Movement sealed-it (2011). At about three months into that spectacle, my psyche screamed for help from the technician. \n\n------\n\nThe inner dialectic:\n\nEssentialist me: \"I need help, please. I want justice, but US justice activists are insane.....look!  Please tell me if you see the same thing\". \n\nTech me: \"OK....well.... let me analyze it for a while, and I'll get back to you. I got this now...you go to the beach...you're pale and look undernourished.... If you want me to help you, you need to help me my staying healthy and alert. Go!\" \n\n--------\n\nThere was a long process of analysis, and every specific parameter the tech found moved us(me) further from activist 'sceners' and the hipster-left NYC 'scene'.\n\nThe Tech told me to forget this avenue in my life, since I can't get to goal of serving justice on this path. \n\n\n----\n\nWe(I) are(am) are now taking a solo tour of the planet. \n\nUS activism is something to analyze, and it is conveievable that our analysis may be of benefit to the cause of justice in the future. \n\nAn Upright-Moral-Compass is the authority over essentialist me(emotions) and the tech(logic). \n\n----\n\nPrimatology comes to mind when I look at the hipster-left. \n\nIt's a tribal system. It's primate-herd behavior. \n\nThere is literally no truth and love in their perceptions, and so it is Tribal-Hyperreality-System. \n\nWe can only look at the whole as one. \n\nThe Tech accumulated all the evidence of the extent of logic used in the movement.\n\nThat tome of logic constructs only a tribal-primate communal existence...that is HAPPY under capitalism in their fantasies. \n\nUS Activism is a Neoliberal Hyperreal Tribal Subsystem of Capitalist society. It is capitalism now. It functions as a offensive system against justice, and as a defense system for the capitalist system of cultural psychology. \n\n------\n\nWhen ones logic is the same, their psychology is the same, and when the psychology is the same, the behavior is the same. \n\nSports game fans know it's a game are fiction, but that doesn't prevent a fiction from filling their entire worldviews.  (horizon of the mind)\n\nHipster Activists DO NOT KNOW their game is a fiction, and so fiction fills their entire worldviews.  (horizon of the mind)\n\n---\n\nNeoliberal society teaches how to live in fantasy. \n\nOnly truth serves justice, and so without truth we have only a dystopia. \"Look! Tell if you see the same thing.\"\n\nActivism hasn't accomplished a thing in 50-60 years since the 'genuine' civil-rights movement that taught the people love and compassion were the roots of justice. \n\n----\n\nThe hipster-left is criminal. \n\nIt abuses every innocent child it ensnares. \n\nMe and the tech can't help. There is only one of 'us' against the multitudinous tribal-hipster-left hordes. \n\nSo they won, and we are relegated to finding some other path in order to fill our need to do good in the world. \n\n---\n\nHow the postmodern age cookie crumbles\n","subreddit":"RadBigHistory","title":"How the Postmodern Age Cookie Crumbles""num_comments":7,"score":0,"selftext":"","subreddit":"communism","title":"How the Postmodern Age Cookie Crumbles"}

All goods \/ services are valued by their **composite labor time** ( in labor voucher hours, see below ). Factor in depreciation and education into cost. For example, a smartphone might cost 0.5 labor hours. Goods that have neglible marginal cost ( ~ 0 labor hours ) would be free.\n- Open, publicly funded research and development is shared by all, with the goal of **decreasing the labor time cost** of every good.\n- Workers are paid in labor vouchers **per hour work performed**. Working 8 hours would earn you 8 LVH ( labor voucher hours ). Multipliers *may* be used if certain work is deemed more necessary, or dangerous, but most likely limited by a certain ratio to foster community.\n- Goods are sold in public shops.\n- Shop managers are instructed to **adjust labor prices so that all goods are sold**. While a good selling out is itself an indicator of demand, adjusting by a certain limited ratio gives more demand information, and prevents unwanted goods from going to waste. \n- Each good now has a ratio of its *sold labor time* to actual labor time cost. \n- If goods are selling *above* their actual labor cost ( ratio &gt; 1 ), that means society wants *more* labor allocated to produce that good. Below that means they want less labor allocated.\n- Planners adjust output targets based on this demand. \n- Planners do material balances to derive gross output requirements ( raw materials + intermediate materials + labor ). Input-output tables are solved using linear algebra. \n- They compare these requirements with the *actual resources* available. Some of these might be set by environmental constraints, or limited quantities.\n- Population uses direct democracy to vote on how much labor to allocate to non-consumer goods ( see below ).\n- They see if the final output targets can be met, and if not, go back to the adjust output targets step.\n- Finally, form a detailed production plan, broadcast it over the internet to all productive facilities, monitor production ( and sales ) in real-time. Adjust plan accordingly.\n\n## Essentials\n\n### Labor vouchers\n\n- Earned by workers. 1 LVH = 1 Labor Voucher Hour earned per hour of work.\n- Attached to a single person \/ family, likely through a credit card. \n- Can only be exchanged for consumer goods. You cannot transfer them to another person. Buying absentee property is illegal. \n- Are destroyed after being used in shops.\n- Possibly destroyed after a certain amount of time ( to prevent hoarding )\n- Labor time across the economy is preserved. If there are 6 million working people in a country : \n  - Labor ministry issues 6 million person-years vouchers to workers. \n  - `0 = Labor hours used producing non-consumer goods ( 2 million person-years ) + labor hours used in consumer goods production ( 4 million person-years ) = cost of goods in shops ( 4 million person-years ) + ( 2 million person-years cancelled for social tax bin )`\n  - Workers spend 4 million in the shops, social income tax of 2 million ( to provide for social services ), and the 6 million labor hours are fully canceled. \n  - This defetishizes consumer-producer relations, since you can see exactly how human labor is being allocated, and spent.\n\n### Direct democracy for non-consumer goods\n\n- New enterprises, entertainment, research and development, social services are all examples of non-consumer goods. \n- Society votes on how much labor to devote to social services: education, health care, child care, environmental protection, national defense. If a country has 6 million adult workers, it might allocate 2 million people to non-consumer goods.\n- Major strategic decisions taken democratically by all the interested population. Minor decisions left to planners. Information open to all, voting available to all.","subreddit":"communism","title":"A detailed breakdown of Cyber Communism."}

The Maharaja himself was implicated in some instances. A large number of Muslims were killed.

Dixon arrived in the subcontinent in May 1950 and, after a visit to Kashmir, proposed a summit between India and Pakistan. The summit lasted five days, at the end of which Dixon declared a statewide plebiscite was impossible. Dixon summarized that people in Jammu and Ladakh were clearly in favour of India; equally clearly, those in Azad Kashmir and the Northern Areas wanted to be part of Pakistan. This left the Kashmir Valley and 'perhaps some adjacent country' around Muzaffarabad in uncertain political terrain.  The sticking point was that Dixon proposed, following Liaquat Ali Khan's objections, that Sheikh Abdullah administration should be held in \"commission\" (in abeyance) while the plebiscite was held.

That the SRP never openly criticised the Soviet Union.\n\n2. The SRP held meetings in East Germany, with presumed Soviet officials. \n\n3. Ladislav Bittman's eulogy on Soviet KGB disinformation campaigns.\n\n\nHowever, there are several problems with this theory, notably amongst them:\n\n- That the SRP was not simply a nazi party, but more evidently Strasserist party, the fact that a particular brand of their politics might have resembled the Soviet Union's does not mean they embraced the Soviet Union or vice versa. They also held other contradictory stances such as denial of the Holocaust and gas chambers, but that the Gas chambers, which they, as mentioned denied existed, were built and operated by the US. \n\n- Whilst there were no direct criticisms of the Soviet Union, a quick glance at their party meetings show that they viciously criticised Communism, Bolshevism, Leninism and Marxism.\n\n- Martin Lee's book is genuinely the only source for this. Seriously, I looked. His sources are disgruntled nazi officials and Macarthyite US officials. Not the best sources to base a work on the shadowy ties of the Soviet Union.\n\n- A major stopper to this theory is that the SRP heavily advocated the re-annexation of eastern Germany. Something that of course the Soviet Union would never allow and would be staunchly opposed to.\n\n- SRP's Bundestag deputy Fritz Dorls, the most consistent member who stayed as one despite the massive decline in popularity with rising living conditions, rejected claims that the SRP sought to collaborate with the KPD and other leftist organizations, arguing that the SRP was staunchly anti-bolshevik. Whilst it is one voice among many, it is important to note his importance and his knowledge of inner group workings. \n\n- The process of de-nazification involved linking nazi groups to Soviet or erstwhile communist groups, to make them seem as bad as each other, in order for society to avoid them both in a Macarthyist paradise.\n\n- When the SRP was outlawed by the Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court), they wrote a report on their activities, [There is also not the slightest trace about this supposed collaboration in the protocols] (http:\/\/www.servat.unibe.ch\/dfr\/bv002001.html) of said report.\n\n- The odds of Stalin funding a fascist party so soon after war seem highly unlikely. \n\n- One of the principle stances of the Bittman crowd is that \"The Soviet use of the Nazi card is not merely aimed at\nWest Germany; Nazi networks have been for decades an essential component of KGB and related institutions' covert operations worldwide.  a blunder which could have disastrous consequences. \". This idea that the Soviet, staunch opponents of fascism, were also secretly funding it is absolutely insane. \n\n- It is claimed that a Doctor Fritz Grobba, Hitler's ambassador to Iraq and Syria, who had planned the 1941 Nazi coup in Baghdad and later went on to become a soviet asset that worked so well, he was awarded with a high position in the Soviet Foreign ministry. This is fiction, Grobba was actually a Soviet prisoner until 1955.\n\n- It is claimed that Francois Genoud, a swiss Banker and financier of the post war nazi ODESSA group was backed by the soviets. This claim has absolutely no proof or evidence to back it up, there is no feasible link between the two.\n\n- Another baseless claim, presented by the Bittman crowd, is that of the case of Nazi General Walter Nikolai who, back when he was just a regular intelligence chief, was alleged to have sent Lenin back to Moscow in a long term plan to establish Communism in Russia. Yeah, you folks read that right, Communism was a secret nazi plan and Lenin was secretly a nazi stooge. Ignoring this bs, the real fault of this lies with the claims that come after, that general Nikolai went by himself to Russia after the war. False, he was captured by the Soviets under the personal orders of Stalin, and died in captivity.

The book continues to criticize the lack of commitment to democracy.\n\nWhile, I am a staunch supporter of a proletariat dictatorship which encourages all members of the proletariat to actively exercise democracy, *as long as they uphold socialism*, I hardly think this is a valid criticism given that Bolsheviks were still at war at that time. Indeed, in wartime, taking fast decisions is usually better than taking correct but late decisions.\n\nFurthermore, a widely participated democracy would certainly involve social democrats and Menshevik sympathizers. Noting that Rosa Luxemburg was adamantly against collaborating with social democrats, her request for such a democratic regime seems contradictory with her ideas. \n\nSo, my question is, had Rosa Luxemburg ever admitted that her criticism on Russian Revolution may be harsh?","subreddit":"communism","title":"Had Rosa Luxemburg retracted her criticism to Russian Revolution?"}
