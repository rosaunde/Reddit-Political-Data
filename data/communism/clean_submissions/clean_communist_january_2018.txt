The biggest one in the capital Kiev drew a thousand activists, who marched through city center carrying torches and chanting traditional slogans like \u201cBandera will come and bring order,\u201d  \u201cUkraine before everything\u201d and \u201cGlory to Ukraine, death to the enemies.\u201d\n\nSimilar events were held in other Ukrainian cities, from Lvov and Odessa to the small eastern town of Slovyansk (*the original source has a mistake, confusing it with Makeevka*), which is located mere kilometers from the disengagement line between Ukrainian troops and rebel forces of the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk People\u2019s Republics. Said republics rejected the 2014 armed coup in Kiev and took up arms partially because the Ukrainian nationalists, who were a major driver of the violence, were perceived as a threat to the predominantly-ethnic-Russian people living in the east.\n\n**Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and Ukrainian Insurgent Army**\n\nDuring World War II, the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, collaborating with the Nazi intelligence agencies, waged war against the Soviet authorities. \n\nIn February 1943, Ukrainian nationalists launched a campaign aimed at exterminating the Polish population of Ukraine\u2019s Volyn region. Their activities culminated on July 11, 1943 in a bloodbath, when the OUN-UIA units attacked nearly 100 Polish settlements slaughtering around 100,000 people.\n\nAfter Ukraine was liberated from Nazi occupation, the UIA turned around to fight against the Red Army, Soviet law enforcement, Communist party members and intellectuals coming from the eastern part of the country. The UIA headquarters and units were formally dismissed on September 3, 1949, but its small separate groups remained active until 1956.\n\nOn July 22, 2016, the Polish parliament passed a document declaring the crimes committed by the OUN and UIA against the Polish population in 1943 and 1944, a genocide. Meanwhile, in 2015, Ukraine\u2019s parliament recognized their activities as the struggle for Ukraine\u2019s independence.\n\n[Source](https://www.rt.com/news/414827-bandera-torch-marches-ukraine/)\n[Other source](http://tass.com/world/983892)\n","subreddit":"communism","title":"Ukraine: Thousands honour nationalist leader Stepan Bandera in torch lit procession"}

This paper, based on Marx\u2019s historical materialism, tried to clarify two questions: why the socialist countries like China must develop market economy, and why the developed capitalist countries like the United States cannot move towards socialism through market economy.\n\nOne: Marx on the Relationship between Market Economy and Socialism\n\nWhat is market economy? \n\nIn Marx\u2019s works, market means the sphere of circulation of commodities. Since commodity economy consists of commodity production and commodity circulation, the market is an internal part of the commodity economy. So what is called the market economy is nothing but another version of the commodity economy from the angle of the commodity circulation.\n\nCommodity economy is a mode of production which is opposite to natural economy. The natural economy means a mode of production which mainly produces use-value, and the commodity economy means a mode of production which mainly produces exchange-value. Because that in the view of Marx, \"developed commodity production is itself capitalist commodity production\" (Capital, II, Penguin Books, 1978, p.190), he used to refer to commodity economy as capitalist mode of production, and correspondingly, to refer to natural economy as pre-capitalist mode of production.\n\nSocialism is the lower phase of communist society, in which commodity economy will not exist. The whole social production will be no longer spontaneously regulated by market, but proceed in a planned way. The socialist mode of production can also be called the planned economy in contrast with the anarchy of capitalist economy. \n\nThe relationships between market economy and socialism are mainly embodied in two aspects:\n\nFirst, the full development of market economy is essential to the realization of socialism. In the view of historical materialism, the development of human society is a process of the successive replacement from pre-capitalist society to capitalist society, then to communist society. Correspondingly, the evolution of the economic formation displays itself as a process of successive replacement from natural economy to commodity economy then to planned economy. So a socialist society cannot be founded on pre-capitalist natural economy, but only on the full developed capitalist commodity economy.\n\nSecond, only by abolishing the market economy can socialist society be founded. The planned economy as a basic feature of the socialist mode of production is incompatible with a market economy. The base of a planned economy is public ownership, but a market economy is related to different kinds of private ownerships. A planned economy means that the whole of social production is controlled by men\u2019s conscious planning, but a market economy depends on the fact that the whole of social production is spontaneously carried out by every enterprise according to the law of value. \n\nTwo: Why the socialist countries like China must develop market economy? \n\nMarx imagined that a socialist revolution would first occur and be successful in\nthe capitalist countries where the commodity economy had gained full development. The actual socialist movement, however, was contrary to his expectation. The countries which first claimed to have realized socialism are those where commodity economy was still underdeveloped and natural economy occupied a large proportion in the national economy. All of them tired to establish their economic systems in the light of the blueprint of planned economy roughly designed by Marx. How did they achieve this aim? Firstly transforming former capitalist enterprises based on commodity economy into state-owned economy; then transforming individual economy based on natural economy into collective economy by compulsory measures; finally establishing a planned economy on the basis of these two different kinds of public economy.\n\nWhy did the socialist countries turn to develop market economy after carrying out a planned economy for many years? The basic reason is that the composition of natural economy in those countries cannot be transformed directly into the planned economy described by Marx. The evolution of the economic formation is a process of natural history, which cannot be realized by compulsory measures. The natural economy can only grow into commodity economy first, and then be able to grow into planned economy. It is obvious that the establishment of the planned economy in socialist countries oversteps the stage of the full development of commodity economy to a great extent. As the planned economy was established in this way, it would be bound to hinder the further development of the productive forces and could not exist for long.\n\nThe transformation in socialist countries has an important significance for realization of socialist society imagined by Marx. Only by this transformation, can socialist countries transform the composition of natural economy into a commodity economy, and create the conditions to realize the planned economy designed by Marx. A market economy is not superior to a planned economy, but superior to a natural economy. Now that socialist countries cannot realize the direct transformation from a natural economy to a planned economy, the market economy is the only middle link between natural economy and the planned economy designed by Marx. So the transformation does not place socialist countries further from the socialism described by Marx, but make them to come closer to it.\n\nSince the existence of market economy means the existence of capitalist economy, there is indeed a possibility of moving to capitalism during the transformation from the former planned economy to market economy in socialist countries. But it is not unavoidable. The effective measure to avoid moving to capitalism is to continue carrying on planned economy in the state-owned economy. The state-owned economy in socialist countries was transformed from a capitalist economy based on commodity economy and got the rapid development under the system of the planned economy. It does not need to go back to market economy, for it has passed the stage of full development of commodity economy and possesses the conditions needed to carry out a planned economy.\n\nTo develop market economy presupposes the existence of multiple sectors of the economy. It means that the transformation from the former planned economy into a market economy is one from two kinds of public economy, i.e. the state-owned economy and collective economy into multiple sectors of the economy. To achieve this aim, socialist countries need only to abolish the planned economy being carried out in the collective economy. Since the collective economy was just an outcome of mandatory order, it will rapidly disintegrate and transform into individual economy, capitalist economy or real independent collective economy once it is free from the control of the planned economy. Thus to continue carrying out the planned economy in state-owned economy does not hamper the emergence of multiple sectors of economy.\n\nAs placing itself in the market economy, the activities of state-owned economy are certainly restricted by the law of value, and will necessarily take profit as a major aim. Is the state-owned economy able to continue carrying on a planned economy under the circumstances of market economy? Here we need to emphasize that the state-owned economy which placing itself in a market economy is that as a whole, not each enterprise as its component part. Though the state-owned economy is a part of a unified market economy, this does not hamper to carry out of a planned economy within the enterprises belong to it. It can makes each enterprise produce according to its unified plan, that is to say, each enterprise cannot arrange production by itself according to the law of value which spontaneously takes effect. Of course, the planned economy which is carried out in the state-owned economy is bound to be conditioned by the unified market economy, and so it is not the planned economy described by Marx. But it does possess some basic features of the planned economy described by Marx.\n\nThe existence and development of state-owned economy in socialist countries are maintained only by the planned economy, for it is the economy of public ownership based on large-scale socialized production. If socialist countries abandon carrying out a planned economy in the state-owned economy and push each enterprise to the market during the transformation from the former planned economy to market economy, the state-owned economy will inevitably transform into capitalist economy.\n\nThe state-owned economy is the conscious strength to move to socialism described by Marx. Individual economy is neither willing nor able to direct move to socialism. Capitalist economy cannot move to socialism spontaneously and certainly opposes socialism. If only the state-owned economy occupies the leading position in the whole market economy, socialist countries will have the possibility of insisting on a socialist orientation for the whole of society and transforming the sector of the capitalist economy, when it has lost its reason for existence, into socialist economy.\n\nThree: Why the developed capitalist countries like the United States cannot move towards socialism through market economy.\n\nThe collapse of socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe makes some left scholars in the West believe that only through market economy can the developed capitalist countries like the United States move towards socialism (therefore they are called market socialists). I do not agree with them. \n\nWhat is the root cause that led up to the failure of socialism in the Soviet Union?\n\nThe market socialists' answer is that it practiced a central planning economy. From this they further deduce the conclusion that market socialism \"is the only form of socialism that is, at the present stage of human development, both viable and desirable. Non-market forms of socialism are either economically non-viable or normatively undesirable, often both at once.\" (David Schweickart, Market Socialism - The Debate among Socialists, Routledge, 1998, p.10)\n\nIt is undoubtedly true that the failure of socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe was closed related to their central planning economy. The crux of the matter, however, does not lie in this fact which is emphasized by market socialists, but in whether their proposition can be deduced from this fact. Through careful analysis we shall find that their proposition is, logically speaking, utterly unjustifiable. \n\nFirst, the central planning economy which was practised in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe was not that envisaged by Marx, and, therefore, the failure of the former can not prove that the latter, too, is bound to fail. Marx emphasized many times that the presupposition of establishing a planning economy is the full development of a market economy. Was the presupposition satisfied in the Soviet Union when it established their planning economy? It is obviously not. Since the planning economy which was practised in the Soviet Union was totally different from that envisaged by Marx, and it is therefore unjustifiable to lump them together and to use the failure of the former to deduce that the latter, too, must fail.\n\nSecond, the level of the productive forces of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe was different to that of developed capitalist countries, and, therefore, the fact that the former could not practise the planning economy envisaged by Marx does not prove that developed capitalist countries cannot do so.\n\nThe level of productive forces of the Soviet Union was relatively low when they established their planning economy. What was compatible with the level of productive forces at that time was not the planning economy but in fact the market economy. The level of productive forces of developed capitalist countries is obviously higher than that of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. In developed capitalist countries, the market economy has been fully developed and has become a fetter on the further development of productive forces. This manifests itself, on the one hand, in all sorts of economic and social problems in these countries, such as unequal distribution of wealth, unemployment, economic crisis, pollution of the environment, all of which relate to the existence of market economy, and, on the other hand, in the development of some non-market or semi-market economic elements or social elements, such as the share of public sector, state-guidance plan, government intervention in the economy, various welfare projects and so on. This means that these countries to a great extent possess the prerequisite for realizing the planning economy envisaged by Marx, and therefore, for them, the issue of how to realize socialism is not that of how to continue and develop the market economy, but of how to abolish the market economy and establish the planning economy, step by step.\"\n\nSchool of Philosophy\n\nRenmin University of China\n\nNo.59 Zhongguancun Street\n\nHaidian Dist, Beijing, 100872\n\nChina\n\nduanzq@ruc.edu.cn\n\n[Source, pdf](https://www.webcitation.org/69nfeZa23?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nodo50.org%2FcubasigloXXI%2Fcongreso06%2Fconf3_zhonquiao.pdf)","subreddit":"communism","title":"\"Market Economy and Socialist Road\" by Duan Zhongqiao (Professor at the Renmin University); Speech given at \"III Conferencia Internacional La Obra de Carlos Marx y los desaf\u00edos del Siglo XXI\""}

For this purpose we will try to analyse what is exactly that gives value to the products we sell. Now the LTV is strictly a theory applicable only to generalized commodity production, in other words only to economies where value is expressed mainly or entirely through the exchange of commodities in a market.\n\nA commodity is exchanged only if it holds some property that result useful to one or more people, this property is not necessarily physical or immediate but it's still present. We will call this property use-value and it\u2019s equal to the need satisfying capacity of the commodity. Such use-value however is not well suited to determine the value of a commodity for multiple reasons:\n\n-Use-value is subjective, as such it varies in magnitude constantly from person to person and even for the same individual in various moments of the day. As such it is not capable of explaining why instead prices tend to remain very stable or follow precise patterns in their fluctuations, especially when empirically measured outside the atomic interaction between individuals but at market level.\n\n-Use-value is not determined in the exchange process, but independently from it (water still holds use-value even if I did not pay it). This is in contrast with prices, which have meaning only within the market itself, because they are expression of the value of the commodity in relationship with other commodities. In other words an object may hold use-value without having value, but not vice-versa, thus are incompatible with the market structure as we know it.\n\n-Use-value lacks a magnitude or comparability. This is because use-value takes many forms, which may be physical (shape, weight, age) or psychological, which are either measured with non comparable units or lack measurability in the first place. To be more specific value cannot be determined by the physical properties of a use-value because there are no universal physical properties that can serve as the base for value, nor there are ways for those physical properties to interact with each other in a useful way. Furthermore non-physical properties (like pleasure, satiety, comfort) lack a precise form of measurement and with it a magnitude or comparability.\n\nIt follows that value needs to be derived from an objective property common to all commodities and independent from its use-value (as far as its magnitude is concerned). The only object that satisfy all these prerequisites is labour intended as abstract labour and measured in labour-time.\n\nWhat do I mean with abstract labour? Just as commodities are all abstracted from their physical form ad equated to a numerical value (price) so is labour abstracted from its physical process and equated to generic human labour. There is no difference between the work of a farmer and the work of a factory worker as far as value is concerned (this is not to say that skill is not a factor, rather the type of work is not considered), because what both are is socially necessary labour that satisfies a particular need of society.\n\nNow it is not right to say that the labour time invested in a commodity is its value, that would mean that an inefficient worker would create more value with its laziness. What indicates value is the average labour time necessary at a societal level to create a commodity. This means that someone taking longer than the average to make something is wasting time as it will not increase the value of the commodity, thus by producing less than what is socially necessary he will loose money. On the other hand if someone is taking less time than socially necessary it means he will be able to produce more than the average in a given amount of time and make a bigger profit, eventually running the underperforming person out of business or forcing him to innovate, bringing down the social average with him.\n\nIf you want to know more I suggest [Mandel's Introduction to Marxist Economics](https://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1967/intromet/index.htm) and [this video series.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGT-hygPqUM&amp;list=PL3F695D99C91FC6F7&amp;index=1)\n\nIf you want a more formal approach to the theory see [Scientific Status of the LTV by Cockshott](http://users.wfu.edu/cottrell/eea97.pdf), [Empirical strength of the LTV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxvNb6ewL7kOdWhYSEI4OVJHTkk/view) by Shaikh, [Testing the LTV in Sweden](http://reality.gn.apc.org/econ/DZ_article1.pdf) and in [multiple countries](http://reality.gn.apc.org/econ/Zachariah_LabourValue.pdf) by Zacharian, [Input-output and dynamic values](https://weeklybolshevik.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/diego-guerrero-input-output-and-dynamic-values-a-spanish-perspective.pdf)by Guerrero. \" \n\nCredit to /u/hexalby.","subreddit":"communism","title":"A user explains the Labour Theory Of Value."}

It reminds me of Lenin's words in his work, \"Should We Participate In Bourgeois Parliaments\", where he states, \"Third, the \u201cLeft\u201d Communists have a great deal to say in praise of us Bolsheviks. One sometimes feels like telling them to praise us less and to try to get a better knowledge of the Bolsheviks\u2019 tactics.\"\n\nTaking Lenin's words, adapting to this situation, we'd have something similar to this, \"...\"Certain\" Communists have a great deal to say in praise of {Xi Jinping and the current CPC]. One sometimes feels like telling them to praise [Xi and the current CPC} less and to try to get a better knowledge of the [tactics that XJP upholds, himself, in regards to Deng, Jiang, Hu and their policies that have, and still, help shape the current state of the China].\"\n\nXi speaks to the import of Deng, Jiang, and Hu, among others, as well as upholding Deng Xiaoping Theory, The Four Cardinals, The Three Represents and the Scientific Outlook on Development, here, in an excerpt from the \"The Governance of China\" in a speech by Xi at the first group study session of the Political Bureau of the 18th CPC Central Committee which Xi presided over, titled:\n\n&gt; Study, Disseminate and Implement the Guiding Principle of the 18th CPC National Congress\n\n&gt; \u201cWe must always remember the historic contributions made by the Party\u2019s three generations of central collective leadership and the Party Central Committee... The first generation of the collective leadership with Mao Zedong at the core provided invaluable experience as well as the theoretical and material basis for the great initiative of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new historic period. The second generation with Deng Xiaoping at the core started the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The third generation with Jiang Zemin at the core advanced socialism with Chinese characteristics into the 21st century, followed by Hu Jintao as general secretary of the Central Committee who adhered to and developed socialism with Chinese characteristics from a new historic starting point. It goes without saying that socialism with Chinese characteristics encapsulates and embodies the aspirations of countless patriots and revolutionary martyrs, and crystallizes the struggles and sacrifices of the myriads of the Chinese people. It is a natural choice for the development of Chinese society in modern times, and it is the only way to bring about the country\u2019s development and stability.\u201d\n\n&gt; Continuing on in that same speech, Xi states, \"In present-day China, adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics means upholding socialism in its true sense.\n\n&gt; The path of Chinese socialism is the only way to achieve China's socialist modernization and create a better life. This path takes economical development as the central task, and brings along...political, cultural, social, ecological, and other forms of progress. It adheres to both the Four Cardinals Principle(1) and the reform and opening-up policy. It entails further releasing and developing the productive forces, and achieving prosperity for all and the well-rounded development of everyone.\n\n&gt; The theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the latest achievement in adapting Marxism to china's conditions. It incorporates Deng Xiaoping Theory(2), the important thought of the Three Represents(3) and the Scientific Outlook on Development(4). We should not abandon Marxism-Leninism or Mao Zedong Thought; otherwise, we would be deprived of our foundation. Moreover, we must focus our work on the practical problems in reform, opening up and modernization, and on our various endeavors, with a view to the application of Marxist theory, theoretical thinking on practical issues, and initiation of new practice for development. In contemporary China upholding the theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics means upholding Marxism in its true sense.\n\n&gt; The socialist system with Chinese characteristics integrates the fundamental political system, the basic political systems, the basic economic system and other systems and mechanisms. It combines national and local democratic systems, the Party's leadership, the position of the people as masters of the country, and law-based governance. This system conforms to the national conditions in China, showcases the special traits and strengths of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and provides a fundamental systemic guarantee for China's development.\n\n&gt; The socialist system with Chinese characteristics is unique and effective. However, we should be aware that it is not perfect or fully functioning. The Chinese socialist system needs to improve to keep step with the development of the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics. During his inspection tour of southern China in 1992 Deng Xiaoping pointed out, \"It will probably take another thirty years for us to develop a more mature and well-defined system in every field.\" It was emphasized at the 18th National Congress that it is imperative to give top priority to the building of systems while giving full play to the superiority of the socialist political system in China. We must improve current systems and promote institutional innovation with theoretical innovation based on practice. We must proceed from reality, formulate new systems in a timely fashion, and put in place a well-developed, systematically and rationally regulated, and effective framework of systems to ensure that all systems and institutions are working properly and functioning well, and thereby provide a more effective institutional guarantee for new victories.\n\n&gt; One: 1. The Four Cardinal Principles refer to the principles of adhering to the socialist path, the people's democratic dictatorship, the leadership of the CPC, and Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the state and the political cornerstone for the survival and development of the Party and the state.\n\n&gt; Two: 2. Deng Xiaoping Theory is an important component of the system of theories of Chinese socialism, and the guiding thought of the CPC. For the first time, Deng Xiaoping Theory systematically answered a series of basic questions concerning the building of socialism in economically and culturally backward China, and the consolidation and development of socialism there. The principle proponent was Deng Xiaoping.\n\n&gt; Three: 3.The important thought of the Three Represents is a major component of the system of theories of Chinese socialism, and the guiding thought of the CPC. This theory emphasizes that the CPC must always represent the requirements for developing China's advanced production force, the orientation of China's advanced culture and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chines people. The principle proponent is Jiang Zemin\n\n&gt; Four: 4. The Scientific Outlook on Development is an important component of the system of theories of Chinese socialism, and the guiding thought of the CPC. It gives top priority to development, puts people first and seeks all-around, balanced and sustainable development with a holistic approach. The principle proponent is Hu Jintao\" - Xi Jinping, 11/17/12\n\nTo be clear, I uphold Xi Jinping Thought, who in turn explicitly upholds Deng Xiaoping Theory, The Four Cardinals, The Three Represents and the Scientific Outlook on Development, all coalescing with the supporting, unshakable foundation - Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

{"author":"Raestagg","created_utc":1516062973,"num_comments":5,"score":12,"selftext":"A Bright Future for Socialism with Chinese Characteristics\n\n\u201cGreat times make great people. Deng Xiaoping was a great and beloved man who arose from the historic struggle of the Chinese nation. His noble character remains fresh in the memories of many people who worked under his leadership and guidance. His lofty revolutionary ideals and charisma will always be an inspiration to us on our path towards the Two Centenary Goals^(1) and the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation. \n\nWe commemorate Deng Xiaoping by learning from his communist ideals and unshakable belief in socialism with Chinese characteristics. His entire political career was marked by a firm faith in communism, which is an everlasting source of integrity for all Chinese Communists.\n\nAs early as 1926 when he studied in the Soviet Union, Deng Xiaoping had made up his mind to devote himself completely to our Party and the working class.^(2) In the next 70 years of his political career, despite all the hardships he experienced and the setbacks the revolution went through, he never faltered in his faith in the scientific nature of Marxism or in the bright future of socialism and communism. Deng said in 1984 that \u201cfaith in Marxism was the motive force that enabled us to achieve victory in the revolution.\u201d^(3) In revolutionary wars, he fought dauntlessly, fearing no death, while in building the war-worn country into a new China, he made painstaking and sustained efforts. During the 10 turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, he remained steadfast in his convictions and never surrendered to setbacks. He observed domestic and international political turbulence with calm and composure, and drove China\u2019s modernization along the socialist path with a firm faith in Marxism and his communist ideals. \n\nIn 1992, the 88 year-old Deng said during his southern China tour, \u201cI am convinced that more and more people will come to believe in Marxism, because it is a science. Using historical materialism, it has uncovered the laws governing the development of human society\u2026So don\u2019t panic, don\u2019t think that Marxism has disappeared, that it\u2019s not useful any more and that it has been defeated. Nothing of the sort!\u201d^(4)\n\nWith a profound understanding of the importance of ideals and convictions, Deng commented, \u201cFrom my long political political and military experience I have learned that unity is of prime importance and that to achieve unity people must have common ideals and firm convictions. Over the past several decades we have united the people on the basis of firm convictions that enabled them to struggle for their own interests.\u201d^(5)\n\nWe have lofty revolutionary ideals. The founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the progress we have today would have been impossible without large numbers of party members committed to communist ideals. Sound national development is inseparable from the support of firm ideals and convictions. In pursuit of a strong Party spirit we Communists should, above all, dedicate ourselves to the longterm goal of communism and the common ideal of building Chinese socialism. Deng has set us an excellent example of devotion to socialism and communism, inspiring us to forge ahead with utter determination and full confidence in the path, theory and system of Chinese socialism.\n\nWe commemorate Deng Xiaoping by learning from his immense love for the Chinese people. His entire life is an expression of his love for the people, which is an inexhaustible source of strength for Chinese Communists.\n\nHe once said, \u201cI am a son of the Chinese people. I have a deep love for my people and my country.\u201d^(6) It was his love for the people that fostered his love for the Party and the country. That is why he said, \u201cMy life belongs to the Party and the country.\u201d^(7) These simple words are a condensed expression of his infinite love for the party, the country and the people.\n\nDeng gave priority to the status and role of the people. He once emphasized, \u201cThe masses are the source of our strength and the mass viewpoint and the mass line are our cherished traditions. The Party\u2019s organizations, its rank-and-file members and cadres must be one with the masses and never stand against them. Any Party organization that deplorably loses touch with the masses and does not mend it ways is forfeiting the source of its strength and will invariably fail and be rejected by the people.\u201d^(8) Whether in high official position or adversity, Deng always stood together with the people through thick and thin, doing everything he could for the Party and the country. \n\nThe people\u2019s wellbeing was his lifelong pursuit. He stressed on many occasions, \u201c...poverty is not socialism...socialism means eliminating poverty. Unless you are developing the productive forces and raising people\u2019s living standards, you cannot say that you are building socialism.\u201d^(9) He designed and led the reform and opening-up initiative and the modernization drive with a view to improving the wellbeing of the Chinese people. \n\nDeng drew insight and strength from the historical achievements of the people to enrich his thinking and embolden him to move forward. He said, \u201cMany brilliant ideas for reform and opening up are created by the people in practice\u2026 They are not conjured out of one single person\u2019s mind.\u201d^(10) Deng repeatedly stressed that it is of paramount importance to take the support, approval, satisfaction and consent of the people as the prime purpose and ultimate goal of all policies and decisions. He always regarded serving the interests of the people as the fundamental principle in his work. \n\nDeng Xiaoping\u2019s love for the people and the country demonstrates one of the deepest and strongest emotions of humanity. We should model ourselves on him and work hard for the interests of the people, remain loyal to the country and the people under any circumstances, and make practical efforts to implement the Party\u2019s general principles. We must dedicate ourselves to the cause of the Party and the people, and serve the people all out life. \n\nWe commemorate Deng Xiaoping by learning from his firm belief in the theory of seeking truth from facts. It is a crucial theory that underpins his thoughts and an approach that should always be followed by all Chinese Communists.\n\nDeng adhered to the Party\u2019s guiding principle of taking facts as the basis of our work. He said on several occasions that he believed in seeking truth from facts. He repeatedly stressed the need to let the facts speak for themselves. He pointed out, \u201cThe essence of Marxism is seeking truth from facts. That\u2019s what we should advocate, not book worship. The reform and opening up policy have been successful not because we relied on books, but because we relied on practice and sought truth from facts.\u201d^(11) He urged leaders to, \u201cwin the trust of the people and bring about tangible results\u201d^(12). And \u201cdo more real work\u201d.^(13) His life\u2019s work shows that he was a farsighted thinker, statesman and strategist as well as a pragmatic doer.\n\nIn the early 1960s when our country was in economic difficulties, Deng stressed to officials the importance of being truthful. To better develop agriculture under the difficult conditions of those days, he said, \u201cAs to what kind of relations of production is the best mode, I\u2019m afraid we shall have to leave the matter to the discretion of local authorities, allowing them to adopt whatever mode of production that can facilitate quickest recovery and growth of agricultural production. The masses should also be allowed to adopt whatever mode they see fit, legalizing illegal practices as necessary.\u201d^(14)\n\nOnce China entered the reform and opening-up period in 1978, Deng Xiaoping put even more emphasis on the principle of seeking truth from facts. He said, \u201cI haven\u2019t read too many books, but there is one thing I believe in: Chairman Mao\u2019s principle of seeking truth from facts. That is the principle we relied on when we were fighting wars, and we continue to rely on it in construction and reform.\u201d^(15) The chief criterion he put forward for judging any action is \u201cwhether it promotes the growth of the productive forces in a socialist society, increases the overall strength of the socialist state, and raises living standards.\u201d^(16) Firmly based on the principle of seeking truth from facts, Deng resolutely solved a series of major issues confronting the Party and the country, leading the Party and the Chinese people to blaze a trail and reach a new stage of development. \n\nFacts are the basis of truth, and hard work is the only path to success. Therefore, we emphasize that empty talk harms the country, while hard work makes it flourish. China\u2019s experiences in revolution, development, and reform have more than once proved that only policies, measures and working methods in line with reality can put the cause of the Party and the people on the right track and deliver practical results benefiting the people. Deng set us an excellent example of using dialectical and historical materialism to observe the world and address issues. This way of thinking and his art of leadership help us acquire a thorough understanding of reality and objective laws, develop a pragmatic work style of high efficiency, and fully implement the Party\u2019s basic theories, guidelines, principles, experience and requirements through solid work. \n\nWe commemorate Deng Xiaoping be learning from his political courage in pioneering and innovative work. His leadership was noted for a pioneering and innovative spirit, which should be forever carried forward by Chinese Communists with a strong sense of historical responsibility.\n\nThroughout his 70-year political career, he exhibited the indomitable courage to forge ahead with reform and an innovative spirit to think ahead and lead the way forward. \n\nIn 1975 when Deng Xiaoping was pushing ahead with nation-wide rectification, he remarked decisively, \u201cAt present, there are a good many problems which we cannot solve without great effort. We must be daring and resolute.\u201d^(17) After returning to leading positions in the Party and the government in 1977, he spoke incisively about the rigid thinking that had long fettered people\u2019s minds: \u201cThose who suffer from it dare not say a word or take a step that isn\u2019t mentioned in the books, documents or the speeches of leaders: everything has to be copied.\u201d^(18) He also pointed out in 1989, \u201cThe world changes every day, and modern science and technology in particular develop rapidly. A year today is the equivalent of several decades, a century or even a longer period in ancient times. Anyone who fails to carry Marxism forward with new thinking and a new viewpoint is not a true Marxist.\u201d^(19) He warned us, \u201cWhen everything has to be done by the book, when thinking turns rigid and blind faith is the fashion, it is impossible for a party or a nation to make progress. Its life will cease and that party or nation will perish.\u201d^(20)\n\nDeng Xiaoping encouraged us, \u201cWe should be bolder than before in conducting reform and opening up to the outside and have the courage to experiment. We must not act like women with bound feet. Once we are sure that something should be done, we should dare to experiment and break a new path...If we don\u2019t have the pioneering spirit, if we\u2019re afraid to take risks, if we have no energy and drive, we cannot break a new path, a good path, or accomplish anything new.\u201d^(21) His theory of socialism with Chinese characteristics provided the first systematic explanation of how to build, consolidate and develop socialism in a socially and economically underdeveloped country like Chinas as it was back then, revealed the essence of socialism and marked another historic step in adapting Marxism to China\u2019s conditions after Mao Zedong Thought. His talks during his southern China inspection tour resolved many major questions that had long puzzled and fettered people\u2019s minds, ushering in a new stage of reform and opening up and socialist modernization. Under his leadership and support, reform came in waves and became the trend of the times, generating historic change to people\u2019s lives, the country and the Party. \n\nAll great causes involve a process of overcoming formidable difficulties and exploring pioneering and innovative paths. In advancing the unprecedented cause of Chinese socialism, we still have a long way to go in completing our reform and opening up and modernization. The road ahead will be full of new challenges. We should learn from Deng Xiaoping\u2019s political courage shown in his pioneering and innovative work to observe new experiences and developments, people, and be resolute in decision-making. In this way, we can integrate innovative experimentation into our regular activities, apply dynamic Marxism to our practice \u2013 which gives rise to new findings and theories to enrich Marxism \u2013 and advance reform and opening up with indomitable courage and the determination to eliminate the outdated and blaze new trails. \n\nWe commemorate Deng Xiaoping by learning from his farsighted, strategic thinking. He demonstrated a breadth of vision through his strategic thinking, with which all Chinese Communist should be equipped.\n\nDeng was noted for his broad vision, resourcefulness, sagacity and incisive mind because he always observed domestic and international developments with the interconnection between China and the world in mind, and had the ability to make smart strategic decisions at crucial moments by taking the broader picture into consideration. After China entered the new stage of reform and opening up, Deng made a series of major decisions of strategic importance to the long-term development of the country, the Party, and socialism, based on his insight into the trends of domestic and global developments. \n\nIn his incisive analyses of the features of developing trends of today\u2019s world, Deng said, \u201cThe present world is open\u201d,^(22) and further pointed out, \u201cReviewing our history, we have concluded that one of the most important reasons for China\u2019s long years of stagnation and backwardness was its policy of closing the country to outside contract. Our experiences show that China cannot rebuild itself behind closed doors and that it cannot develop in isolation from the rest of the world.\u201d^(23) On the other hand, he cherished and championed China\u2019s national sovereignty and the Independence won by the Chinese people through countless struggles. Therefore, he asserted, \u201cChina\u2019s affairs should be run according to China\u2019s specific conditions and by the Chinese people themselves. Independence and self-reliance have always been and will always be their basic stand\u2026 No foreign country should expect China to be its vassal or to accept anything that is damaging to China\u2019s own interests.\u201d^(24)\n\nPaying great attention to global peace and development, he emphasized the need to \u201cregard the problem of development as one that concerns all mankind, and study and solve it on that level.\u201d^(25) Showing concerns for other developing countries, he stressed that China, \u201cshares a common destiny with all Third World Countries\u201d. He pledged that \u201cChina will never seek hegemony or bully others, but will always side with the Third World,\u201d^(26) and that China will oppose any forms of hegemony and safeguard world peace.\n\nStrategic issues are fundamental to a political party and a country. Accurate judgment and sensible planning help us gain the the strategic initiative crucial to the success of the cause of the Party and the people. We should learn from him his global vision and strategic thinking of  \u201cbearing in mind the overall interests, keeping in view the world, the future, the present, and all other factors\u201d^(27) in analyzing questions. We should learn from his keen awareness of the key issues and his highly logical and sharp mind that was able to think ahead and lead the war into the future. He had a broad vision of history and the world in planning the cause of the Party and the people, and his quick perception and foresight helped him solve key strategic issues and advance all aspects of his work with a broad strategic picture in mind.\n\nWe commemorate Deng Xiaoping by learning from his broad mind and selfless devotion. His charismatic leadership came from such quality that remained all his life, and is a quality that Chinese Communists should cultivate and retain.\n\nDeng always considered himself a member of the working people while practicing strict self-discipline according to the rules for Party members. He never flinched in the face of difficulties, and he always cared for his comrades and remained modest and prudent. Deng set a good example for us how a Communist should strive to cultivate himself and enhance his Party spirit. \n\nDeng Xiaoping always gave priority to the development of the Party and the country regardless of his own personal interests. He said, \u201cI joined the revolutionary ranks at 18, and all I wanted was to make revolution succeed.\u201d^(28) The three falls and three rises in his political career were all the results of his firm stance in upholding truth and correcting mistakes and his magnanimity, optimism, composure and tenacity in the face of wrongful criticism and unjust removal from office. Every time he resumed his posts, he worked dauntlessly to overcome all obstacles and dedicated himself to ensuring that the right guidelines and policies were formulated and implemented. Returning to leading positions after the Cultural Revolution, Deng spoke frankly about his attitude towards work, \u201cNow I\u2019ve come back to work. I could take two different attitudes. One, be a bureaucrat; two, do some solid work. I said to myself, after all it is my own choice to join the Communist Party. Now that I\u2019ve resumed office, I must never be a bureaucrat, never work for personal gains. There is no other alternative.\u201d^(29) He was truly a selfless and broad-minded Communist.\n\nDeng took a fair and objective attitude towards history, his comrades, and himself. He was modest, amiable and easy to work with. He knew how to work together with his colleagues. After fighting countless battles side by side with Liu Bocheng^(30) for 13 years in the revolutionary wars, they formed a strong friendship. Deng knew how to work with people who had opinions different from his own and gave full play to their abilities, regardless of personal feeling. \u201cWhen selecting the right person for the right job, you should forget about settling old scores and may choose from among those who were once against you,^(31) he observed. He opposed corruption and privileges of any kind and set strict rules for his relatives and his immediate staff. \n\nDeng remained modest despite his great merit. He said on several occasions, \u201cI hope they will never give me too much prominence. What I have done represents the aspirations of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communists, that\u2019s all.\u201d^(32) As a materialist, he regarded death with an open mind and told his family, \"Sooner or later, I will leave this world. When I leave is nothing important. No one can bend the law of Nature. You\u2019ve got to understand this.\u201d^(33) After his death, his corneas were given to the hospital, his remains donated for medical research, and his ashes cast into the sea as requested in his will. \n\nParty members of noble character should live up to the name of Communists, and are loved by the people. We should learn from Deng\u2019s selfless devotion to public interests and his dauntless spirit and broad mind. To this end, we need to strengthen our Party spirit, practice strict self-discipline while being inclusive towards others, take an appropriate attitude towards Party organizations, our colleagues and ourselves, and exercise power in the right way.  It is important to practice the core socialist values^(34), dedicate ourselves wholeheartedly to the cause of the Party and the people, and take the lead in establishing upright conduct within the Party and the government and among the general public.\n\nThe essence of the theoretical and political legacy bequeathed to us by Deng Xiaoping is the Chinese socialism that the Party and the people created under  his leadership, and the Deng Xiaoping Theory. Karl Marx wrote in \u201cThe Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte\u201d, \u201cMen make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past.\u201d^(35) Deng\u2019s theory and practice are prominently marked by a firm belief in the principle of proceeding from reality in everything we do, taking the national and international situation into consideration, and by adherence to the CPC\u2019s principles of seeking truth from facts, independence, and the mass line.  \n\nChinese socialism is a path that suits China\u2019s national conditions and reality and the requirements of the times in both theory and practice. Therefore, it has yielded and will continue to yield practical results. Deng emphasized that \u201cif the developing countries of the Third World, like China, have no national self-respect and do not cherish their independence, they will not enjoy that independence for long.\u201d^(36) Independence in our development path, theory and system is key to our national sovereignty, independence and dignity.\n\nThe Chinese nation has created a splendid civilization that can be traced back over 5,000 years. Under CPC leadership, the Chinese people have achieved new successes on the socialist path, paving the road for further progress. We must improve our weaknesses and change backward things, and learn from the strengths of other countries. We must not blindly copy things foreign, not to say accepting bad things. We must not underestimate ourselves and should cherish the best of our traditions and culture. \n\nWhen talking about the founding of the People\u2019s Republic, Deng stated, \u201cChina has achieved status: People dare not look down upon us.\u201d^(37) Therefore, we must not renounce the achievements made during the New Democratic Revolution^(38), deny our accomplishments in socialist reform and development, and waver in our direction of reform and opening up and socialist modernization. This is why our Party and the people are qualified to stand tall in the international community. History of modern times tells us that China\u2019s affairs must be handled in accordance with Chinese national conditions and reality. This is the only correct way to address all of our problems. \n\nDuring the 17 years since Deng Xiaoping passed away, the world has witnessed tremendous changes. Our tasks to carry out reform and development at home are arduous and heavy. Following the guidelines, principles, and policies set forth at the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC National Congress convened in 2012, the CPC Central Committee has led the Chinese people in implementing the guidelines of the 18th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary session of the 18th CPC Central Committee held in 2013. We uphold socialism with Chinese Characteristic and follow the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents and the Scientific Outlook on Development. Taking China\u2019s overall domestic and international interests into consideration, we have furthered reform to promote the sustained and healthy development of the economy, and improved out style of work, striving to create a bright future for the cause of Chinese socialism. \n\nStep by step, the blueprint laud out by Deng Xiaoping for socialist modernization is becoming reality. Our country is becoming strong and more prosperous and the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation is coming true. We have every reason to be proud of our achievements.\n\nAt this point, however, it is imperative to remember Deng Xiaoping\u2019s exhortations, \u201cWe have been building socialism for only a few decades and are still in the primary stage. It will take a very long historical period to consolidate and develop the socialist system, and it will require persistent struggle by many generations, a dozen or even several dozen.\u201d^(39) He pointed out, \u201cThe essence of socialism is liberation and development of the productive forces, elimination of exploitation and polarization, and the ultimate achievement of prosperity for all.\u201d^(40) Socialist modernization, complete reunification of our country, and the great national rejuvenations, which are dreams long pursued by the older generations of Chinese revolutionaries, including Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, are the common aspirations of all Chinese people. \n\nDeng Xiaoping once reminded members of our Party, \u201cThe period from now to the middle of next century will be crucial. We must immerse ourselves in hard work: We have difficult tasks to accomplish and bear a heavy responsibility.\u201d^(41) Now we are taking on these tasks and weighty responsibilities. All Party members must unite closely and work hard to fulfill our duties, and rally and lead the Chinese people to keep up with the times and achieve new successes in enhancing and developing Chinese socialism, making and increasing contributions to peace and development for all mankind.\n\nWe are convinced that the CPC and the Chinese people, who won historic victories in the 20th century, will achieve greater successes in the 21st century.\u201d\n\nNOTES:\n\n1\\. The Two Centenary Goals were put forth by the CPC at its 18th National Congress for building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The two goals are to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects by the centenary of the CPC (founded in 192) and to build China into a modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, and harmonious by the centenary of the PRC (founded in 1949). - Tr.\n\n2\\.

We were 'entertaining' a group of foreign students and trying to lead a Bedouin kind of life in order to politicize our Bedouin population. The students had been attending an international solidarity meeting in Amman held under the auspices of the General union of Palestinian Students. Most were graduates of the 1968 university upheavals in the West. We found it very amusing that they honestly believed they were making a 'revolution' if they undressed in public, seized a university building, or shouted an obscenity at bureaucrats. I was initially opposed and refused to talk to them, even though some believed in violent revolution, because I didn\u2019t want to be another experimental 'guinea-pig' to Westerners.\n\n&gt;I finally relented and I am glad I did. I hadn\u2019t met Western 'revolutionaries' before. It turned out they represented an unfamiliar cultural rather than a political phenomenon. Some seemed to have read the history political literature of the left, but most regarded the Marxist-Leninist leaders disdainfully, with the exception of the 'Young Marx,' who held some sort of fascination for revolution. Some Americans were quite serious and believed in the historic mission of the working class and were making plants to integrate themselves with the masses. \n\n&gt;What astonished us most about this group was that they were opposed to nationalism, a doctrine we hold dearly as a colonized and dissipated people. Some believed in violence for 'the hell of it' and in students as revolutionary agents of history. But the majority were inclined towards guerrilla theatre as a means of 'making revolution.' They performed a little for us.\n\n&gt;As they were departing I was rather struck by a French anarchist student who proclaimed 'Let chaos reign' and by a German who echoed the same sentiment. I exclaimed that the Palestinian people were an example of a society in chaos without authority and leadership, which as a result, was left at the mercy of the Zionist oppressor. I asked them what could they prescribe for us in order to overcome our kind of alienation'--beards, long hair, and toy guns? They merely paused, they smiled, they reflected, they inhaled and passed their joints on in universal wonder.\"","subreddit":"communism","title":"Leila Khaled discussing a meeting with Western leftists at a PFLP camp""num_comments":5,"score":20,"selftext":"","subreddit":"socialism","title":"Leila Khaled discussing a meeting with Western leftists at a PFLP camp"}

It is copied more or less verbatim below with a follow up comment due to space, having only additional quotation marks to make up for reddit's formatting restrictions and small edits to correct some formatting errors I discovered in the linked document.**\n\n_____________\n\nBy Noel Ignatin and Ted Allen\n\nNote To The Present Edition\n\n\nAccording to my calculations, this is the sixth printing of White Blindspot; it is reproduced here with no changes. I wrote the first part in the winter of 1966-67 as a letter ofcriticism to the Progressive Labor Party, which is today a near-forgotten sect, but which seemed formidable at the time. When PL refused to publish it, it was printed privately by a group consisting of me, Hilda Vasquez, Esther Kusic and Ted Alien. The letter to PL together with one to me from Ted, constitutes White Blindspot. \n\nThe article, together with others developing and restating the theme (some of which are collected in this pamphlet) has provoked its share of controversy, both informed and uninformed. In general, I consider the article successful in that it said fairly precisely what I wanted to say. Nevertheless, looking back on ten years of controversy, and possessing a greater knowledge of my audience than I had ten years ago, I would today write it somewhat differently. There are a few points in my part of it on which I would lay greater stress, in\norder to avoid some misinterpretations by both opponents and supporters.\n\n\nI would emphasize that what is being talked about is not some kind of a stage theory in any way comparable to the two stages of revolution in a semifeudal nation oppressed by foreign imperialism. The article explicitly rejects such an interpretation, but not with sufficient force. Let me repeat here that the article is talking about only one struggle, the proletarian class struggle, in which the rejection by white workers of white supremacist ideas and practices is crucial to the emergence of the proletariat as a revolutionary class.\n\n\nThe second point I would stress is that the \"white skin privilege\" line is not a general policy of lecturing white workers to alter their thinking and behavior. While some lecturing is necessary (and some fighting as well) the main thing involved is an approach toward strategy which is manifested in the choice of slogans and issues, the character of alliances, methods of organization \u2014 in all things which make up the total line of a revolutionary group.\n\nThe third thing I would underline is that \"repudiation of the white skin privilege\" does not mean that our major work should consist of asking white workers, one by one, to give up their relatively good neighborhoods, jobs and schools in favor of Blacks and other Third World people (although individual actions are certainly appropriate and effective at times). The phrase in quotes refers to a policy of struggle, of which mass action is the decisive aspect, against the ruling class policy of favoritism for whites - a struggle which the article tries to demonstrate, is in the class interests of the proletariat as a whole.  \nN.I.  \nJune, 1976\n\n__________\n\n&gt;\"It is only the blindspot in the eyes of America, and its historians, that can overlook and misread so clean and encouraging a chapter of human struggle and human uplift.\"  \n-W.E.B. DuBois, Black Reconstruction, An essay toward a history of the part which black folk played in the attempt to reconstruct democracy in America, 1860-1880. (p. 577)\n\n\n&gt;\"The emancipation of man is the emancipation of labor and the emancipation of labor is the freeing of that basic majority of workers who are yellow, brown and black.\"  \n-Ibid., p. 16\n\n**LETTER TO PROGRESSIVE LABOR**\n\n\nIn response to your request for comments from readers, I am writing this letter raising what I consider to be the fundamental error in your strategic outlook for the revolutionary struggle of the American working class. In my opinion this error consists of your failure to grasp and incorporate in your program the idea contained\nin the following statement by Marx:  \n\n&gt;In the United States of North America every independent movement of the workers was paralysed so long as\nslavery disfigured a part of the Republic. Labor cannot emancipate itself in the white skin where in the black it\nis branded. (Capital, Vol.1, Chapter 10, Section 7)\n\nWhile you pay a great deal of attention to the Negro liberation movement, and correctly recognize it as a part of the global struggles for national liberation, you fail to discover the specific role it plays in the proletarian revolution in the United States. Thus, in your strategy for the proletarian revolution, you place the Negro question outside of the class struggle.  \n\nIn my opinion, you do this in spite of the fact that you cite Mao's correct words that, 'In the final analysis, a national struggle is a question of class struggle.' In this letter, I shall attempt to demonstrate the truth of my criticism and, in the process, suggest what I consider to be the correct strategy for the American working class.\n\n**THE GREATEST BARRIER TO CLASS CONSCIOUSNESS**\n\nThe greateat ideologicl barrier to the achievement of proletarian class consciousness, solidarity and political action is now, and has been histocially, white chauvinism. White chauvinism is the ideological bulwark of the practice of white supremacy, the general oppression of blacks by whites.\n\nThe U.S. ruling class has made a deal with the mis-leaders of American labor, and through them with the masses of white workers. The terms of the deal, worked out over the three hundred year history of the development of capitalism in our country, are these: you white workers help us conquer the world and enslave the non-white majority of the earth's laboring force, and we will repay you with a monopoly of the skilled jobs, we will cushion you against the most severe shocks of the economic cycle, provide you with health and education facilities superior to those of the non-white population, grant you the freedom to spend your money and leisure time as you wish without social restrictions, enable you on occasion to promote one of your number out of the ranks of the laboring class, and in general confer on you the material and spiritual privileges befitting your white skin.\n\nOf course there are dislocations in this set-up. Contradictions between antagonistic forces cannot be resolved except\nby revolution. The masses of white workers produce vast quantities of value, and there is consequently an unceasing\nstruggle over how this value shall be divided - within the preimposed limits of the deal.\n\n**THE ORIGINAL 'SWEETHEART AGREEMENT'!**\n\nBut in spite of this unceasing and often fierce struggle, what exists is an opportunistic \"contract\" between the exploiters and a part of the exploited, *at the expense of the rest of the exploited* - in fact, the original \"sweetheart agreement\"!\n\nDoes this mean that the white workers have no revolutionary potential, that they should be written out of the ranks of the revolutionary forces? Does it mean that, as far as the white workers are concerned, communists must sit passively and wait until the ruling class, of its own necessity (e.g. loss of colonial holdings) moves to cut its losses at the expense of some of the white workers' racial privileges and attempts to reduce them to or near the level of black, brown and yellow workers?\n\nIn my opinion it does not mean either of these things. In spite of their privileges, the white workers (except for the\naristocracy of labor) are exploited proletarians, victims of \"the stupid system of violence and robbery which we call\nLaw and Industry\". (G.B.Shaw) In the struggle for socialism, as *well as the struggle for immediate reforms*, without which the working class will never achieve socialist consciousness, the white workers, like their black, brown and yellow brothers, have a \"world to win\". *But--they have more to lose than their chains; they have also to \"lose\" their\nwhite-skin privileges, the perquisites that separate them from the rest of the working class, that act as the material base for the split in the ranks of labor*.\n\nPL deals with the struggle for the unity of the working class in the following manner, from your convention document.\n\n&gt; The unity of black and white workers can be forged only in the course of winning the white workers to struggle against the common class enemy for their own class demands, and by combating racism and by supporting the cause of Black Liberation.\n\nAnd in another passage, this time from the editorial on Watts in the October 1965 issue of PL, we read the following:\n\n&gt; White workers today are generally better off than the black people, who are engaged in a militant struggle for more jobs, housing and full political rights. But even today, where white workers are fighting for the same demands, they are also ruthlessly wiped out, like the unemployed coal miners of Hazard, Kentucky or the 80,000 laid off white railroad workers, victims of the Johnson-bosses-union-gang-up or the teamsters shot at in a recent Tennessee strike.\n\n&gt; They, too, meet up with violent repression at the hands of\nthe ruling class.\n\n&gt; As more and more white workers lose their jobs due to automation and the inability of the capitalist war economy to grow along with the population, they too will have to fight for their economic and political demands, or go under.\n\n&gt; The Johnson administration has only one answer for workers who struggle for a better life-armed terror and suppression. Just as it commits genocide in Vietnam and the Congo, the government does not hesitate to use its army against the black people at home. Similarly, the same thing is in store for white workers who fight back as soon as they feel the squeeze.\n\n&gt; By rejecting the racist slanders of the press and the hysteria whipped up by the politicians who serve the bosses, by supporting the black people in their liberation struggle, white workers are protecting themselves and preparing their own defense for the attacks Johnson will unleash against them when he and his bosses cannot meet their  demands.\n\n**THE \"PARALLEL STRUGGLES\" FALLACY**\n\nBoth of these passages are representative of the general line of PL; both *avoid the central question* of the struggle  against white supremacy. Both explicit and implicit in the passages cited is the concept that white workers have \"their own class demands\" which are *separate from the* demands of Negro liberation (which you summarize as \"more jobs, housing and full political rights\"), and that in the parallel struggles of two groups of workers for two sets of demands lies the path to the unity of black and white workers.\n\nThis is wrong on two counts: in the first place, it is not correct to reduce the demands of the Negro liberation movement to \"more jobs, housing and full political rights\" - these are the demands of *all* workers. (Nor is it enough to toss in the demand for self-determination, as you do elsewhere, as a slogan for the *Negro* nation: the writings of Lenin on the national-colonial question make it abundantly clear that self-determination of an oppressed nation is a slogan directed toward the working class of the *oppressor* nation.) The fundamental demand of Negro liberation is and has been for one hundred years *the ending of white supremacy*, the granting to the Negro people of every bourgeois right held by every other sector of the American people, excepting the other oppressed national minorities.\n\nIn the second place, the ending of white supremacy is not solely a demand of the Negro people, separate from the class demands of the entire working class. It cannot be left to the Negro people to fight it alone, while the white workers \"sympathize with their fight,\" \"support it,\" \"reject racist slanders\" etc. but actually *fight* for their \"own\" demands.\n\nThe ideology of white chauvinism is bourgeois poison aimed primarily at the white workers, utilized as a weapon by the ruling class to subjugate black and white workers. It has its material base in the *practice* of white supremacy, which is a crime not merely against non-whites, but against the entire proletariat. Therefore, its elimination certainly qualifies as one of the class demands of the entire working class. In fact, considering the role that this vile practice has historically played in holding back the struggle of the American working class, the fight against white supremacy becomes the *central immediate task of the entire working* [class.]\n\nThe incorrect formulations and evasions which abound in the two passages I have cited from PL documents are not mere slips of the pen. For nowhere in your literature do we find a single appeal to the white workers to fight against white supremacy in the *only way possible*, by *repudiating* their white-skin privileges and joining in a struggle with the rest of the working class for the demands of the entire class.\n\n**PROGRAMMATIC ERROR - A HYPOTHETICAL CASE**\n\nYour wrong theoretical approach to this question expresses itself in a wrong program. Thus, in an article by Antaeus in PL of Oct.-Nov. 1966, it is stated:\n\n&gt;It now remains for a revitalized labor movement, led by the rank-and-file, to fulfill one of its greatest inheritances from its glorious past: to fight the \"national interest\" squeeze of the Johnsons and the Kennedys, and their corporate masters; to raise the deteriorating standards of the working class, to curb unemployment, *especially* among black, Puerto Rican and Mexican workers, to fight all this by launching a nation-wide struggle for shorter hours at 40 hours pay. (Our emphasis-N.I.)\n\nMy, my. It seems that the shorter work week has more uses than aspirin. Now, it is probably true that the winning of the shorter work week would provide more jobs for the Negro, Puerto Rican and Mexican workers.\nOne can easily compute the mathematics of it: in a factory presently operating with 6 toolmakers, 60 machine\noperators, 60 assemblers, 6 packers and 3 sweepers, each working 40 hours a week, if the work week were shortened to 30 hours the following changes, more or less, could be expected: in place of the present 6 toolmakers (all white) 8 would be required to produce the same quantity of value in 30 hours that is produced in 40. However, since there is a shortage of toolmakers, they would continue on 40 hours, drawing overtime pay. In place of the 60 machine operators (all white), 80 would be required; the additional 20 would be drawn from those assemblers with the greatest seniority (all white). We now have 40 assemblers left, but need 80; their ranks would be filled by advertising in the \"help wanted, women\" section, or from the ranks of the unemployed white men. For the increase of two packers required, the plant would hire one white and one Negro. And finally, to provide the additional sweeper (couldn't we do without him since we're now on 30 hours?), a Negro would be hired, in accordance with the traditional personnel policy.\n\nThus we would have a net gain of two jobs for Negroes. Perhaps exaggerated, but not much. Of course, those who put forward the demand for the shorter work week as a partial solution to the problem of Negro oppression argue that Negroes would benefit from it to a greater extent proportionately, than their numbers in the population, since they take up a disproportionate share of the unemployed. That is possibly so. One can concede the possibility (although not the certainty) that out of the 62 or 63 new workers needed in my example, maybe four, instead of two, would be recruited from the ranks of the Negro unemployed; perhaps even the lilywhiteness of the ranks of the assemblers might be tinted a little.\n\n**\"FAIR EMPLOYMENT THROUGH FULL EMPLOYMENT\" \u2014 A WHITE SUPREMACIST SLOGAN**\n\nBut would this disturb the institution of white supremacy? I am not here opposing the \"30 for 40\" slogan. But raising it the way you do, to \"curb unemployment, especially among black, Puerto Rican and Mexican workers\", is merely an echo of the \"Fair employment through full employment\" argument of Secretary of Labor Wirtz and other spokesmen of the \"liberal\" wing of the ruling class. Even at its best (which will never be) \"fair employment through full employment\" is just another way of excusing the practice of leaving the Negroes as the last hired. Under such a slogan we may be assured that the last unemployed man or woman\nhired - the one that makes it \"full\" - will also be the one that makes it \"fair\". In other words, \"fair employment through full employment\" is another way of saying that job discrimination against Negroes will be maintained as long as it is possible to do so.\n\nThe point is: raising the demand for a larger slice of the pie for the working class does not in itself alter the apportionment of the slice within the working class. In fact, the ruling class has always utilized every concession won from it to increase the gap between white and black, thus turning even a victory of the working class into a cause of greater division. The shorter work week, with the promise of more jobs for those last hired, does not challenge the pattern of who shall be last hired, and therefore does not alter the inequality of white and black workers. Is it not a fact that there have been times when the average real income of the Negro worker has increased, while at the same time the gap between the Negro and white worker has also increased? Thus, while the living conditions of the Negro people may have improved for a time absolutely,\nrelative to those of the white population they deteriorated. To accept the premise that the way to improve conditions for the Negro workers is by increasing the proportion of the value created that goes to all workers is equivalent to institutionalizing the split in the working class, and accepting the inferior status of the Negro and other colored workers.\n\n    \"IF YOU WANT SHORTER HOURS,\n            LET ME TELL YOU WHAT TO DO...\"\n\nI would go further - the working class will not be able to win the shorter work week, *will not even be able to resist the growing offensive of the ruling class*, unless it first comes to grips with white supremacy as the chief cause of the division within its ranks.\n\nThere is no easy way around this problem. The struggle against white supremacy cannot be replaced by the struggle for a larger portion of the pie to be parcelled out unequally among the workers. The only way to overcome the division in the working class is by overcoming it. \n\nElsewhere in your literature you raise the demand that 80% of the jobs in the big industrial plants in the Watts ghetto should go to the Negro residents of Watts, since they make up 80% of the area's population. In my opinion, this demand contains some merit, as well as some faults. But taking it for its merit, that it raises the need for a more equal distribution of the existing jobs instead of banking on the same unequal distribution of new jobs, let me place the question: for whom is this demand raised? For the Negro workers and unemployed alone? In that case it is a divisive slogan, and should be dropped. For the entire working class? In that case it is, at least partially, a unifying slogan, and should be supported. But then it is necessary to explain to the white workers, and especially those white workers at the big plants in Watts, why they should support such a demand, even though it apparently threatens some of them with the loss of their jobs.\n\nIt is the same with the slogan which I understand was raised in the election campaign of Wendy Nakashima (PLP candidate for state legislature in the 1966 elections - ed.) in New York City last year. I am told that her demand for preferential hiring for Negroes and Puerto Ricans received quite a bit of support in the mainly Negro and Puerto Rican district in which she campaigned. It is easy to see why. But if that is a good demand - and I am convinced that it is -then it must be good also for the white workers, and they must be explained the reasons why so that they may become active partisans of it.\n\nFor, make no mistake about it, with the U.S. imperialist economy stagnating or even contracting, the ending of\nwhite supremacy, the ending of the privileged position of white workers means fewer jobs for white workers, fewer skilled jobs, poorer housing etc. - if it goes no further than that. For it is obvious that if the rate of unemployment among Negroes is lowered from around 25% where it now stands to about 8% (which is \"normal\" in this period of imperialist decline for workers not suffering from national oppression or \"favored\" by white supremacy) then the rate of unemployment among white workers must be increased from the 5% where it now stands (by virtue of their whiteskin privileges) to the 8% which is \"normal\". And likewise\nwith the proportion of skilled and unskilled jobs held by Negro and white workers, and so forth.\n\n**IF IT GOES NO FURTHER THAN THAT...**\n\nBut please note the phrase in my last paragraph: \"if it goes no further than that\". For the consequences of the ending of white supremacy, which can only be ended by mobilizing and raising the consciousness of the entire working class, would extend far beyond the point of spreading out the misery more equitably. The result of such a struggle would be a working class that was class conscious, highly organized, experienced and militant - in short, united - and ready to confront the ruling class as a solid block. *The ending of white supremacy does not pose the slightest peril to the real interests of the white workers; it definitely poses a peril to their fancied interests, their counterfeit interest, their white-skin privileges.*\n\n*As* long as white supremacy is permitted to divide the working class, so long will the struggle of the working class remain on two separate planes, one concerned with their \"own\" class demands and the other, on a more elementary plane (but with a much higher degree of class consciousness) fighting first for the ordinary bourgeois rights which were won long ago for the rest of the workers. As soon as white supremacy is eliminated as a force within the working class, the decks will be cleared for action by the entire class against its enemy.\n\nAnd what would be the outcome of such a struggle? Well, consider: if it were not for the ideology of white\nchauvinism, the American workers would by now have a labor party, which would represent a step forward in the class struggle. If it were riot for the ideology of white chauvinism, the South would be organized, with all that that implies. If it were not for the ideology of white chauvinism, the American workers could see clearly the racist, imperialist, anti-working class character of the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, and oppose it from the only possible proletarian standpoint - opposition to U.S. imperialism. \n\nCommunists (individually this is the task primarily of white communists, although collectively it is the responsibility of the whole party) must go to the white workers and say frankly: you must renounce the privileges you now hold, must join the Negro, Puerto Rican and other colored workers in fighting white supremacy, must make this the first, immediate and most urgent task of the entire working class, in exchange for which you, *together with* the rest of the workers will receive all the benefits which are sure to come from one working class (of several colors) fighting together.\n\nThis does not mean that the process will develop in clear stages, i.e., first the ending of white supremacy, then a massive struggle for reforms, then revolution. It is probable that Negro liberation will not take place without the conquest of power by the working class in our country as a whole. What it means is that, in the course of mobilizing the entire working class to fight white supremacy some victories will be won and, most important of all, the ideology of white chauvinism will be widely exposed as the weapon of the oppressor, thus preparing the working class for the assumption of power. In this way the Russian workers, led by the Bolsheviks, made the liberation of their \"own\" colonies an integral part of *their own class demands* (now let us use your phrase without quotation marks) and thus were prepared to carry out their revolution.\n\n**\"THE REAL^1 SECRET\" - AN INSTRUCTIVE PARALLEL**\n\nWhen we consult the writings of the founders of scientific socialism, we find a wealth of material on this question. In a *Resolution on Relations Between the Irish and the English Working Classes*, written by Marx in 1869 for the International Workingmen's Association, we read the following:\n\n&gt;On the other hand, the *English bourgeoisie* has not only exploited Irish poverty in order to worsen the\ncondition of the working class in England, by the foreed transplantation of poor Irish peasants, but it has\nmoreover divided the proletariat into hostile camps. The revolutionary fire of the Celtic workers does not\nharmonize with the restrained force but slowness of the Anglo-Saxons. In all the big industrial centers of\nEngland a deep antagonism exists between the English and Irish workers. The average English worker hates\nthe Irish as a competitor who lowers his wages and *level of living*. He feels national and religious antagonism towards him. He appears to him in much the same light as the black slaves appeared to the poor whites in the Southern States of North America. This antagonism between the proletarians of England is artificially cultivated and maintained by the bourgeoisie. It knows that in this antagonism lies the *real secret of maintaining its power*. (All emphasis in original.)\n\nAnd in the same year, on November 29, in a letter to Kugelman, Marx wrote:\n\n&gt;I have become more and more convinced \u2014 and the only question is to bring this conviction home to the English working class - that it can never do anything decisive here in England until it separates its policy with regard to Ireland in the most definite way from the policy of the ruling classes, until it not only makes common cause with the Irish, but actually takes the initiative in dissolving the Union established in 1801 and replacing it by a free federal relationship. And, indeed, this must be done, not as a matter of sympathy, with Ireland, but as a demand made in the interests of the English proletariat. If not, the English people will remain tied to the leading-strings of the ruling classes, because it must join with them in a common front against Ireland. Everyone of its movements in England itself is crippled by the disunion with the Irish, who form a very important section of the working class in England.\n\nPlease note the last phrase in the above citation. Now, if Marx could correctly observe that the Irish workers  formed a \"very important section of the working class in England\" in 1869, what are we to say of the position of the Negro workers in the American working class in 1967?\n\n**BLACK WORKERS ARE PROLETARIANS - NOT \"ALLIES\" OF THE PROLETARIAT**\n\nThis brings me to another error you make. For it follows logically from your first error of placing the national question outside of the bounds of the class struggle that you also isolate the Negro workers from the working class as a whole. In actuality, you relegate the Negro workers to a kind of limbo, peripheral to the main body of the working class, \"allies\" of the working class - anything but the integral part of it that they are.\n\nThe proof of this assertion lies in your underestimation of the importance of the Negro liberation struggle for the future of the American working class. Yes, I say *underestimation*, for that is in fact what you are guilty of *in practice*. I will give you some examples. \n\nYou correctly pose as one of the tasks before the working class that of building a third party, a labor party. But just such a party is being born under your very eyes, and you are blinded to it by your chauvinist (might as well speak plainly) lack of appreciation of the significance of the Negro liberation movement, such as the Black Panther Party in Lowndes County, Alabama, and the Freedom Democratic Party in Mississippi, as well as other stirrings in the same direction throughout the country. Of course these movements differ in their degrees of clarity and maturity, but is there any doubt that they represent motion toward a breakaway from the two-party strangle-hold? Suppose the Negro people succeed in launching such a party, will it not contain within it the essentials of a labor party program, in spite of its label as a Negro party? Will it not then be a prime task for those armed with Marxist-Leninist theory to take the program of such a party to the white workers and rally their support for it, whatever its name? And even if this party makes its appearance under less than ideal circumstances, for example under the auspices of a demagogue and opportunist like Adam Clayton Powell, as long as it is a real living party and not still born like the Freedom. Now Party of 1963, the same thing will hold true - for let us not forget that the CIO was born in 1935 by one labor faker, John L. Lewis, punching another, William Hutcheson, in the jaw!\n\nIf we are dialecticians, we base ourselves on what is new, and look under the appearance of things to discover their essence. And one of the essential features of American history, which must be understood by everyone who hopes to apply Marxist-Leninist theory to the specific conditions of our country, is that *traditionally the Negro people, for very real reasons, have carried forward the demands of the entire working class, cloaked in the garb of Negro rights!* This is true even now of the Black Power slogan, whose significance is not limited to the Negro people. As a white worker, I declare that I Would a thousand times sooner live under the Black Power of Stokely Carmichael than under the \"white\" imperialist power of Lyndon Baines Johnson!\n\n**THE ONLY CHOICE** \n\n*And this is the choice which today, on one level or another, confronts every white worker*. It can be seen most clearly in Sunflower County, Mississippi, where the only alternative to Black Power, for both black and white poor, is Eastland power. But the developing reality of the class struggle will soon bring forward in dramatic contrast everywhere the truth that *there are only two paths open to the white workers: with the boss, or with the Negro workers; abandonment of all claim to share in the shaping of our destiny, or repudiation of the white-skin privileges for which we, in our very infancy, pawned our revolutionary soul.*\n\nAnother example is the Mississippi Freedom Labor Union. In your trade union program, you praise it as a necessary response to the jim crow practices of the labor brass. Fine! But you treat it as a stop-gap measure until such time as the racist unions change their policy. Why not instead recognize it as the kernel of a potential workers' controlled labor movement for all workers? You yourselves state that the union officials are now in the process of converting the unions into a fascist labor front. Instead of casting around for a way out of this by\nlooking for some possible new alignments among the faction-ridden labor brass, why not recognize the importance of what is really new? In Mississippi we see the amazing (for the US) phenomenon of workers organizing their own union to fight the bosses. Are you going to let the fact that these workers are black blind you to the fact that they are, first of all *workers*, and leave you standing on the sidelines with your mouths full of patronizing words of admiration, unable to see that these black workers are today the foremost representatives, not merely of the Negro liberation movement, but of the American working class?\n\nIndeed, under present conditions, with the Negro liberation struggle moving into high gear while the rest of the\nworkers remain backward and relatively quiescent, to speak of the white workers \"supporting\" the Negro liberation movement is something of an impertinence. *The Negro liberation movement is today doing more for socialism and the class demands of the proletariat than any \"working class\" movement outside of it, and represents the firm and reliable support for any progressive struggles which may develop among white workers.* More, it represents a solid base from which to develop such struggles. But in order to draw upon the strength of the Negro' people's movement, the white workers must, first of all, break the links which tie them to the bosses (to the \"leading-strings of the ruling classes,\" as Marx wrote Kugelmann) by repudiating the white supremacist contract.\n\n**THE SUBJECTIVE FACTOR WAS IGNORED...**\n\nIf this is not done we will see repetition of what has transpired more than once in our history: the crisis arrives, conditions worsen, the working people are radicalized - and then - defeat, because the subjective factor was ignored and the white-skin privilege and its vile ideology were not specifically, directly, consistently and courageously denounced and renounced in words and in deeds. \n\nUp to now in my critical remarks I have dealt only with the white chauvinism in your erroneous theoretical line. But you also exhibit its inevitable concomitant: serious deviations in the direction of bourgeois nationalism. Since I regard the battle against bourgeois nationalism as primarily the responsibility of those Negroes imbued with Marxist-Leninist theory, I will limit myself to pointing out one example from your literature. In the November-December 1966 issue of\nSpark, your west coast paper, you report the speech of John Harris, whom you identify as a PLP organizer, before a mass rally in Watts: \"Harris talked about the war in Vietnam and said that Black men should not fight against their Vietnamese brothers, 'who look more like them than the white man who sent them there.\"\n\nSuch a statement does not require much comment. If made by a black nationalist, it would be a positive statement and could be supported, but when made by a responsible leader of an organization which claims to be guided by the science of Marxism-Leninism, and then reprinted in an official publication of the organization, it becomes nothing more than shallow opportunism. The vanguard of the working class is the home of the internationalist workers; while bourgeois nationalism, outside the party, may on occasion play a positive role, within the party it has no more place than the white chauvinism which engenders it. \n\nI would like to conclude this letter by referring to the words of old John Brown. For many years it has been the\nfashion in American left-wing circles to pay homage to old Osawatomie, while ignoring the lessons he taught us. Usually this is done by dismissing his use of armed struggle under the pretext that it was \"appropriate for another era.\" But there was more to Brown than his determination and heroism; he was a serious and careful student of American social reality. In his last letter to his family, Brown wrote to his children to \"abhor, with undying hatred also, that sum of all villainies \u2014 slavery.\"\n\nJohn Brown clearly understood that all the social evils of our country were summed up in the \"peculiar  institution\" of African slavery, without whose abolition progress in any field would be impossible.\n\nSo it was to old John Brown, and so it is to us, his children. For, all the evils of US imperialist rule in its dying days - the barbarous wars of extermination launched against colonial and semi-colonial peoples, the murder by starvation, the mass insecurity, the fascist clamp being tightened on the American people, the trampling on culture and the contempt for the decent aspirations of humanity - all these are concentrated and summed up in the infernal theory and practice of white supremacy. Therefore, the attack on white supremacy is the first order of business for all progressive forces in our country, and the key to strategy for Marxist-Leninists.\n\nFraternally yours,\n\nNoel Ignatin\n\nMarch 1967\n\n______________________\n\n**A LETTER OF SUPPORT**\n\nDear Noel:\n\n\nA few comments on your draft letter to PL:\n\n\nEsther and I have, until now, been alone in this view and approach to strategy (at least as far as we know). First of all, nobody else has even posed the problem of strategy; they are \"all dressed up and no place to go.\" We were, therefore, simply exhilarated by your letter; it is a sheer delight, a bull's-eye scored against a well chosen target. It will be most interesting to see what PL will do with it. Let them ignore it at their peril - murder will out!\n\nSome people with whom we have discussed this idea - the attack against white supremacy as the key to strategy in the struggle for socialism in the United States \u2014 have grasped the significance of it almost out of sheer class instinct, even without accepting the basic theory from which it is derived and is a part. Such encouraging reaction has been more frequent among Negroes than among whites, but not exclusively among Negroes.\n\n","subreddit":"communism","title":"White Blindspot""num_comments":0,"score":1,"selftext":"","subreddit":"intlleftalliance","title":"White Blindspot"}

Certain nationalist aspects, such as religion and pan-Turkism are advantageous to the socialist and world revolution, because a wider range of people could be attracted to the communist goal. However, this would mean that communism in itself would be more diverse, and different interpretations should be permitted.\n\nNational communism inspired the *korenizatsiia* policies of bolsjewist Russia during the late 20s and early 30s, in which Stalin as People's Commissar of Nationalities at the *Narkomnats* in accordance with Lenin permitted local and transnational nationalisms in order to gain popular support for the bolsjewist cause.\n\nAfter this short background, how do you comrades feel about national communism? Should all Marxist interpretations be bundled into a single, homogene force, or can nationalist aspects be used to gain a wider range of support? I'm curious to your guys' interpretations and would like to hear from you. Thanks! ","subreddit":"communism","title":"National Communism"}
