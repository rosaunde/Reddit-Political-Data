{"author":"mjohns112","body":"In my opinion, America is in a state of post-feminism. I feel that a lot of women believe that they already have equality (many men unfortunately perpetuate this) when in reality they do not. We definitely still live in a rape culture where it\u2019s ok between *us boys* to speak about what we\u2019d do to *her*. Women certainly do not get paid equally compared to men. A fair amount of my guy friends told me that they wouldn\u2019t vote for Hillary because she is a \u201cshady bitch.\u201d (Hell yeah she is shady but it\u2019s because she\u2019s a fucking liberal reactionist; she already starts a peg lower because she is a woman to them) I\u2019d bet some greasy capital that if she was a man, she would\u2019ve had much better chances at winning the 2016 election. \n\nWomen are constantly exposed to the endless advertising from Capitalist beauty industries who encourage them on one hand to be more outgoing and sexually active while on the other hand, they say this only if you are beautiful and to be beautiful you must use *our* products. Millions of Americans are blind to this and our very body perceptions have been redesigned by profiteering. \n\nMarxists know that Capitalism will exploit the public by any means, especially by misleading them into thinking they *need* their products. In order to gain true equality between all genders, we must abolish these harmful industries or at least their mindless advertising...for now, and redesign our perceptions of ourselves. Men are groomed by endless advertising to try to look and act as masculine as possible, and that to gain status in society is to be a *player* or some violent badass. (Only part of the problem, but a big part nonetheless) \n\nIn a way, those commercials for women are correct in that females should be liberated from domesticity (if that\u2019s what she wants, of course, it\u2019s ok to want to be a homemaker or mother or both) and should not be shackled sexually to the whims and pleasure of a man. However, the commercials just further emphasize the teachings of Marx since when women become more educated as a result of encouraging them to step out of their shoes (if we are lucky) they can awaken and see the damage that those commercials have dealt on their collective psyche. \n\nCapitalism will destroy itself.

{"author":"predalienmack","body":"First of all, if we lived in a socialist country, no one person would be \u201crunning it.\u201d The whole idea is having a society run by the workers, or at minimum elected representatives from amongst the workers, on a collective basis. Second of all, Marxists throughout history have been against religion as an institution that gathers wealth and political power to use to its own ends (namely for pacifying the populace into accepting systems of exploitation with promises of benefits in the afterlife). There is nothing wrong with people having a religion, but if they use their religious beliefs as an excuse to oppress nonbelievers, women, lgbt folks, etc., that belief system isn\u2019t going to fly in a socialist country for very long, and if a religious organization attempts to divide society on religious grounds, then it must be suppressed for the good of society. \n\nHistorically, major religious organizations (such as the Catholic Church) have molded themselves to reflect the dominant system in which they exist within. So when we observe Catholicism during the times of feudal Europe, the Pope acted very similar to a feudal lord, and the structure of the church had some striking similarities to feudal relations. Under capitalism, the Church has acted much more like a corporation. Under a socialist system, I\u2019m sure the Catholic Church and other religious organizations would adopt a much more egalitarian structure and general practices.

{"author":"vagabonditis","body":"After thinking about it in the shower, I came up with this argument and spent the whole day thinking about it. I put this argument on another social media website addressing this same article a friend posted. I like challenging my views so I had to address this and came up with this. \n\nZizek is quite the clever sophist. I admit, I was taken aback at first, but it became clear where his arguments fall flat.\n\nHe declares Communism a failure, a question that could be answered by delving into the timeline to see what actually happened. Without actually looking at real historical events, his dialectic falls flat. Anyone can spin language games without looking at history. We don't even have to venture too far before we can see his words fall out of focus.\n\nBefore Communism in Russia, the land was feudal-capitalist under the Tsars, poorly mismanaged. After the revolution, the USSR rivaled the US in overall nutrition. Even the CIA, US's enemy, admits this.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.cia.gov\/...\/readingroom\/docs\/DOC_0000498133.pdf\n\nThe fact that it regressed into capitalism because of brute force by global capitalism, doesn't mean that it was a failure. Millions of lives were made far better with free home, education, housing. Undeniably, the USSR was safer, as research and accounts of the USSR has shown. You could be a five year old by yourself taking public transportation and nobody would care.\n\nThere's no telling how Capitalist Russia would be right now had the Tsars continued unrelentingly, or had been overthrown by a capitalist class instead of the Bolsheviks. Communism definitely put a stop to that for 70 years. While history isn't necessarily teleological in hindsight and I personally have a Benjaminian look on history, there are effects and probabilities we can look at. It is probable that Capitalism would be even worse had Communism not been there before. This might not have turned out to be true, but Zizek chooses to ignore this thought.\n\nZizek forgets that after the Cultural Revolution, traditional views like women being inferior or footbinding were lessened by their threatened eradication, and women had power in politics. Mao chose to destroy traditional feudal notions, that your lot in life is where you'll end up.\n\nHe accuses Mao of opportunism, which is funny, because Mao didn't want to be as involved as he easily could've been after he took power. Mao was a leader but still had to go through others in the party. He takes the caricatured viewpoint of Mao instead of delving into the details.\n\nThe life expectancy before Mao's time was 35 years. After Mao, it rose to 65 years. How would China look right now if US-backed feudal Chiang Kai Shek would still be allowed free reign without the Communists intervening? \n\nHe declares it a failure without seeing the alternatives and what would've happened if Communism had not been in place at all. It's not difficult to see why these movements regressed back into Capitalism. The world is Capitalist and the US doesn't hesitate to destroy any country that even tries Communism, eradicating 20% of the DPRK population wasn't even an issue as long as the Communists were stopped because the North Korean economy was increasing. Their list of invasions is staggering.\n\nhttp:\/\/davidswanson.org\/warlist\/\n\nYes, Capitalism is strong, but did those countries regress back into Feudal-Capitalist societies? No. Zizek attempts to spin alternative ways of doing things without providing historical context.\n\nHis thought inadvertently becomes reductive: \"Communism existed and now Capitalism is stronger, therefore, Communism made Capitalism stronger,\" instead of thinking perhaps Capitalism might have been stronger without Communism. Before Marxist thinkers, there was 14 hour work days and child labor.\n\nCommunists and their praxis definitely put these ideas on the map and we see their manifestation even in Capitalist countries, like socialized healthcare and education. How do we know that these would've been implemented had Communist countries not existed?\n\nNot many are conservative Marxists. Leninism revised Marxism and created a real revolution by merging theory and practice (which was why Lukacs considered Lenin a thinker equal to Marx). Maoism then revised Leninism. A person who doesn't see a certain point of flexibility to them ignores the history of its developing thought.\n\nAlthusser already addressed Zizek's point and I'm convinced he took the idea of the gap between Marx and Marxists from Althusser. Marxists nowadays would have to be deluded not to consider present conditions in theory. According to Zizek's definition, I'm not a Marxist as well, which is fine if he thinks Marxists are dogmatically stuck in theory like himself, without actually going out into the real world and putting his ideas into praxis to see how his thought could change it as well.\n\nMarx himself avoided referencing philosophers and chose to look at the conditions of his day. His theory should only be looked at as framework by Marxists and must take into account the present conditions.\n\nAnd where's the alternative according to Zizek? What action are we supposed to take? Or does combating oppressive forces only exist in theory? Real world praxis is needed to mold theory. What action are we supposed to take in the actual world for the alternative that Zizek just chooses not to mention.\n\nAlso, if it weren't for Stalin and the normal, average citizens of the Red Army, the world might have decayed into Fascism because of Hitler. But apparently Communism made Capitalism stronger by combating Fascism?","created_utc":1525264926,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

To answer your question, it was by no means a death sentence. There are some statistics of the mortality rate of prisoners. The rate peaked at 25% in 1942 and was at 22% in 1943, which likely has more to do with the war and the resources available for feeding the prisoners. Most of the other years the mortality was under 10%, and under 1% in the later years. The total official number of deaths in the GULag from 1930 - 1956 is 1.6 million (Source: \u0421\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043c \u041e\u0423\u0420\u0417 \u0413\u0423\u041b\u0410\u0413\u0430 (\u0413\u0410\u0420\u0424. \u0424. 9414)).

{"author":"wrldtwn","body":"And as I said in a private message earlier, they collapsed only after they introduced more \"free market\" principles; the US had to rein in the free market to recover from 2008.\n\nThese two paragraphs make it clear that external Western pressure exacerbated its economic problems, and Gorbachev's freeing of the markets made them worse:\n&gt;By the 1980s, the USSR was showing the strains of the Cold War. Its economy was growing, but at slower pace than it had in the past. Military competition with its ideological competitor, the United States, had slowed growth in multiple ways. First, R&amp;D resources were being monopolized by the military, starving the civilian economy of the best scientists, engineers, and machine tools. Second, military spending had increased to meet the Reagan administration\u2019s abandonment of detente in favour of a renewed arms race that was explicitly targeted at crippling the Soviet economy. To deter US aggression, the Soviets spent a punishingly large percentage of GDP on the military while the Americans, with a larger economy, spent more in absolute terms but at a lower and more manageable share of national income. Third, to protect itself from the dangers of relying on foreign imports of important raw materials that could be cut off to bring the country to its knees, the Soviet Union chose to extract raw materials from its own vast territory. While making the USSR self-sufficient, internal sourcing ensnared the country in a Ricardian trap. The costs of producing raw materials increased, as new and more difficult-to-reach sources needed to be tapped as the older, easy-to-reach ones were exhausted. Fourth, in order to better defend the country, the Soviets sought allies in Eastern Europe and the Third World. However, because the USSR was richer than the countries and movements it allied with, it became the anchor and banker to other socialist countries, liberation movements, and states seeking to free themselves from despoliation by Western powers. As the number of its allies increased, and Washington manoeuvred to arm, finance, and support anti-communist insurgencies in an attempt to put added strain on the Soviet treasury, the costs to Moscow of supporting its allies mounted. These factors\u2014corollaries of the need to provide for the Soviet Union\u2019s defence\u2014combined to push costs to the point where they seriously impeded Soviet economic growth. \n\n&gt;With growth slowing, and the costs of defending the country increasing, it appeared as if it was only a matter of time before the USSR would find itself between the Scylla of an untenable military position and the Charybdis of arms race-driven bankruptcy. Mikhail Gorbachev, the country\u2019s last leader, faced a dilemma: he could either bankrupt the economy by trying to keep pace with the Americans on arms spending or withdraw from the race altogether. Gorbachev chose the latter. He moved to end the Cold War, withdrawing military support from allies, and pledging cooperation with the United States.

However, rather than rescuing the country from a future of ever slowing economic growth, Gorbachev\u2019s capitulations on foreign and economic policy led to disaster. With the restraining hand of the Soviet Union lifted, the United States embarked on a series of aggressions around the world, beginning with Iraq, proceeding to Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq again, and then Libya, with numerous smaller interventions in between. Gorbachev\u2019s abandonment of economic planning and efforts to clear the way for the implementation of a market economy pushed the country into crisis. Within five years, Russia was an economic basket case.

After the American military ran over two schoolgirls and used its legal privileges to escape South Korean justice, millions of people were on the streets demanding the US leave. The IMF crisis directly linked poverty and labor rights to sovereignty and American imperialism. And no one in their right mind supported the Iraq War or the Bush administration.\n\nWhat happened? Roh moo-hyun sent troops to Iraq and the anti-American movement died. This is not just history, Moon jae-in represents the direct continuation of the Roh faction of his party and his chief of staff during these events. We have to understand why that happened and what the limits of liberalism are in South Korea, which is far more progressive than American liberalism (which is wholly reactionary) but still incapable of throwing off the yoke of imperialism. We also have to understand the failure of the American left during the Bush presidency, a moment most people here were probably too young to be involved in but impacts their political possibilities immensely, something liberals have to deny to make Trump seem like a singularly evil figure and disguise their own complicity in the Bush presidency and current warmongering.

There are two possible explanations for this:\n1) Friedman, Popper,  Ko\u0142akowski and others were all utter morons who knew nothing about political science and economy and could not or would not undertake the easy task of debunking Marxism and its oh-so-obvious inherent contradictions in fewer than 30 non-technical words.\n2) You do not understand those things as well as you think you do, and this includes not only Marxist thought but simple statements about Marxist thought too. \n\nI this specific case I stated very clearly that the bourgeoisie is inevitable *the way the system is configured*.

{"author":"comradeconvict","body":"Whilst this isn't a discussion sub, i will try to answer your question, and the mods may feel free to remove this comment if unappropriate\n\nJust to preface this: This is my opinion, there are varying opinions among people who consider themselves socialist\/communist, ranging from democratic socialists (not to be confused with social-democrats), trotskyists, marxist-leninists, maoists and many more. \n\n\n&gt;A common problem in communist societies is that people who do harder jobs feel as if they deserve more compensation than those who do easier jobs. How would this be dealt with, and is it fair? If people in positions of management feel this way, what\u2019s to stop them from unequally distributing wealth?\n\nWhat i think is agreed upon by most socialists, is that a society needs to follow a distinct path that Marx outlines. He believes that the world progresses in certain stages; primitive communism (hunter gatherers), slave society, feudalism, capitalism, socialism, and then communism\n\nThe distinction between socialism and communism is cruical to your question. In short; in socialism you work as hard as you want, and you are paid for how much you have worked. This is not the case in capitalist society. If i work for eight hours and produce 5 chairs i am (usually) paid the same as if i produced 10 chairs. However, in a socialist society i would be paid according to my labour, meaning if i make 1 Lenin Dollars for each chair, i would get 5 LDs for producing 5 chairs in eight hours, and 10 LDs for producing 10 chairs in eight hours. There would also cease to be private property (not your toothbrush, but means of productions; for example factories, schools and offices), and workers would themselves be able to democratically ellect a supervisor.\n\nIn such a society, the exploitation of labour will cease to exist, and in turn we will become more egalitarian. In other words, we are shaped by the society we live in, and today that is a capitalist system. Along with capitalism comes the gloryfication of rich people, and the everlasting quest for material wealth. After people have become less materialistic, and more egalitarian, we can move over into communism.\n\nCommunism is a system where everyone works to the best of their ability, and recieves based on their needs. This means of course that you will be paid the same ammount of Lenin Dollars no matter how many chairs you make. I understand that this is an abstract idea, maybe seemingly utopian, but that is the belief of communists (or some atleast)\n\nSo my answer to your first question is basically that we probably won't jump straight from capitalism to communism; there will be a period inbetween, hopefully avoiding the problems you point to.\n\n&gt;In order for communism to work, it needs to be have nearly unanimous cooperation. Is this realistic in further developed countries?\n\nDon't we under capitalism as well? If 50 percent of the population just decided to not participate, it would surely mean the collapse of our entire economic system. In a communist society, one wouldn't be motivated by the thought of: \"I need to work or i die\". There would be other insentives to participate, such as social pressure, or the fact that working is mutually beneficial; others are relying on you to work, and in turn you are relying on them. \n\n&gt;In order for communism to be successful, people must be carefully watched to ensure that fraudulent claims aren\u2019t made to gain resources?\n\nPerhaps, but so is it in a capitalist society. Lots of rich people hide their money away in offshore bank accounts for instance. The only difference is that there won't really be a motive under communism. The profit motive that exists in capitalist societies would be gone, and there would be pointless to hoard resources for personal gains, as there won't be a private market. \n\n&gt;What will happen to artists? Especially authors like George R.R Martin, whose games of thrones books are wildly successful, but only released a book every couple months?\n\nThis is a hard one. How do we measure art, books, movies or even teaching? I think that is a good question, but i also believe that it somehow can be achieved, i just don't have a good answer right now.\n\nFeel free to ask any more questions if you like, either to my comment or hit me up with a pm. If you have specific questions about socialist countries, i know a fair bit about the USSR, but little about the others.","created_utc":1525357155,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"closovsky","body":"There is a good take on this from Sartre; in a society where accumulation is the measure of ones own social station, destruction of it takes a spiritual meaning. In a romantic sense, if the powerful and conformist accumulates, the opposite side, the non-conformist transgresses the rules of accumulation and destroys it, and if you have nothing, even your self. Like the carnivals and great fists of old, all is consumed, aka destroyed. You just need to read the early romantic novels from lord Byron and such; intensity of existence, burning passion, murder, hatred all is the other side of the coin of a cold, bureaucratic, dead form of existence, that of bourgeoise accumulation. Self destruction, by drugs or others, the ultimate sign of non conformity. Of revolt, but not of revolution, since those who revolt need a system to revolt against so that their holy status will be visible. So, no overthrowing, but a constant antagonising, which is perfect for a Baudelaire bohemian hero, but nothing to do with working class revolution. Yet again, Sartre's What Is Literature? is a good read on the subject.","created_utc":1525379939,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Anyone with more knowledge regarding Chinese laws, feel free to correct me; but as far as I'm concerned, China doesn't have *any laws* regarding strikes at all. Which means strikes are neither legally regulated, but neither is it banned. A lack of a legal regulations isn't the same as banning.

If wages have been stagnating, then it could only be in the informal sector, which the state couldn't oversee. The article itself admits this, and it even pointed out that there are law requiring employers to properly sign contracts with workers.\n\nSo what's the point being made here? If this was some sort of \"repression\", why did those laws exist in the first place? In fact, why did the state increase wages at all? Why did the state even make it mandatory for labor contracts to include social security and health insurance? It seems pretty clear to me that the poor working conditions of these migrant workers is an **administrative issue**. It reflects the state's lack of capability to put informal labor relations under legal supervision, rather than any sort of deliberate repression.\n\nIt's also extremely disturbing how self\\-professed \"communists\" can have such a liberal usage of the term \"dictatorship\". This is littered throughout the article. Dictatorship of which class? The article doesn't answer this, but say \"dictatorship of Xi Jinping\", \"dictatorship of Communist Party\" \\- which is the typical rhetoric of RFA, VOA and other neoliberal websites.","created_utc":1525419587,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"corvibae","body":"Hi, I'm a historian and someone who is writing a book about the history of the Irish Republican Army\/Irish politics since the Good Friday Agreement, and also a communist. It's kind of a nuanced issue and I'm going to provide some background re: why I support the IRA and stuff like that.\n\n\n**Background**\n\nFrom the time of the Norman Conquest until today, the British have occupied Ireland in some shape or form. Today, that form is the province of Northern Ireland, effectively six counties which were broken off from the rest of Ireland in the 1920s after several hundred years of ethnic cleansing by the British. Until the 1970s and 1980s, Protestant Majority in Northern Ireland had rights and preeminences that the Catholic minority did not, and a war was waged, called The Troubles, which killed several thousand people and was fought between the British Army and Loyalist militia groups against the Official and Provisional IRA, the INLA, and other  Republican groups for around thirty years. The war officially ended for the majority of the P\/O IRA in 1998 with the signing of the GFA, crucially, however, the Loyalist militias refused to decommission their weapons, and so, groups such as the \"Real\" IRA and Continuity IRA maintained stores of arms and continued actions against the imperialist British state, and political parties such as Republican Sinn Fein, the 32 County Sovereignty Movement, and most recently Saoradh, continue to advocate for a united, socialist, Ireland.\n\n**The political situation today**\n\nIn Northern Ireland today, non Sinn Fein republican activists continue to get harassed by state forces on both sides of the border. Catholics are still discriminated against in Northern Ireland, and the UDA\/UVF etc continue to daub graffiti in order to make Catholics and republicans afraid. The Orange Order continues to march through Catholic and republican neighborhoods to mock and intimidate the population. The CIRA, and now the New IRA, continue to struggle against the British Army and the Loyalist groups.The CIRA and NIRA also work to protect their community from harmful gang and drug violence, which one would think the Police Service of Northern Ireland would handle, but instead they spend their time harassing republicans, including youths. \n\nPolitically, the British government continues to treat Northern Ireland, as well as the Republic of Ireland, as a poorer relation. The recent EU referendum has caused considerable tension in the area, and the British are refusing to accept that the Republic of Ireland has a say in the border between the North and the Republic. Many fear that this signals a return to the \"hard border\" of the Troubles era, in which the British Army and the RUC(forerunner to the PSNI) engaged in armed patrols along the border, conducted searches, and had literal fortresses facing the Republic. Their refusal to even pay attention to Irish concerns in this regard is just one example of a myriad of chauvinistic attitudes towards both the Irish Republic in the south and the republicans in the North.\n\nThe government in the North of Ireland today is also very problematic. The Loyalist-led parliament continue to refuse any and all attempts by the significant republican minority to do even simple things, such as an Irish Language Act to protect and preserve the rapidly diminishing native language of the Island, are rebuffed. The recent RHI scandal, a program organized by the DUP(main loyalist party in the North) has caused even more political tensions between the republican minority and loyalist majority. The DUP's leader and her husband both benefited from the scheme, and the leader is refusing to resign. The whole situation is a giant clusterfuck.\n\n*In conclusion*\n\nThose, however, might not be enough. My main reason for supporting the various IRAs(critically, to be fair), is because they still maintain support in the community. The CIRA and NIRA quite simply would be unable to operate without support from the population. They're able to march, sometimes armed, and despite the best efforts of the PSNI and the Gardai(Irish police) to tamp down Republican activity.  There are valid criticisms of the various IRAs, but at the same time, the good significantly outweighs the bad. ","created_utc":1525463723,"score":14,"subreddit":"communism"}

You're a monopoly or nothing. If you're here posting and arguing with me about it, you're already a no one.

Do you realise what kind of joke I'm talking about here? The one that is on those who do not realise on what side of history they are on. You. In america the concentration of wealth is gone so ridiculous - but not only america - that a mare 8-10% of the population owns 85% of its wealth, and that the bottom 70% owns 3. The silly thing is that even people like you, who have all to lose form it, are cheering for their own misery; they have interiorised the managerial classes ethos whilst being exploited. They think that they can make it big; they still believe the american dream of the 60s.

If China, Vietnam, Laos, Cuba, etc could hit the button and magically become fully communist in a day, I'm sure they'd do it, but in the case of Cuba and North Korea, that's hard to do when you're under sanction (and, unfortunately, run by risk-averse and likely corrupt leaders). In the case of China, they are moving towards communism if you believe party doctrine, which adheres to a pretty basic Marxian idea which states that capitalism is a necessary stage along the way to socialism because it develops the productive\/technical base. Once that's complete, a complete transition can take place.\n\n2. There's a reason Marx didn't go into details - he didn't really care about them. I'd respond to your friends by saying, \"Who cares what a communist society looks like?\" The finer details of what social control over the means of production looks like are a shrug to me - I'm not a policy wonk. Besides, having been socially conditioned into the capitalist mode of production, we sort of lack a vocabulary to describe systems that don't exist in practice. Ask your friends if the average person living in feudal England - even the most educated - would be able to describe a capitalist economy.

May I add to your comment a bit?\n\n&gt;It is important to not let our message be watered down when it comes to white supremacy, patriarchy and the rape of the third world. We can't afford to cater our message too much or we risk losing the revolutionary edge that must be carried if we are to sever the system of oppressions that exist within Amerika. \n\nI think that it is important for us to have the means to carry and promote this core message. If we do stray into niche areas, it should be planned a planned straying; if we are to take action in a given area, it should be a planned action. In short, we need to be able to focus our mass on productive work.\n\nAn old way of doing this was using a party, but in the US it is extremely hard to agree with each other, let alone coalesce into a mass party. Another way would be through reporting or propaganda, but we are so awash with media that it's impact is lessened when it is not ignored altogether.\n\nSo how do we approach this? Where do we start to build party discipline? We have plenty of people asking for the presence of a party here in the US, but what they really want to know is where can we help in a mass movement. We have almost no where to point them yet; not that meets them where they are; not that gives them a voice; not that has a firm strategy to move forward or even one that allows voice to plan such strategies.

{"author":"Wardiazon","body":"I was never particularly inspired to assign myself to any particular ideology at all. As an 'edgy' 12 year old, the stereotype is that you become an ideological fanatic and dream of revolution. The truth is, I was never committed to any particularly ideology, I just saw the need for change. I had been interested in politics since the 2005 election (yes, I was three years old), and was always concerned with word events.\n\nIt all began about 4 years ago (I'm 16 now), when my dad was watching 'The Trews' by Russell Brand (an interesting series in my opinion) on YouTube. I was interested by the philosophy it drew out of me. I could no longer sleep properly because I started constructing power systems and political manifestos in my mind (I have ASD, and my special interest is Politics), at that point, I began having my own revelations. It was around the same time I started watching 'The Trews' that everything was kicking off politically in the UK (before David Cameron quit post-Brexit, this was even before the 2015 general election!), there was a large anti-austerity process going through London to get to Parliament Square. I remember coming down from my room and just seeing it on my dad's computer. I watched it with intensity and such rigour that I was inspired and instilled with revolutionary energy.\n\nIt was after this that I started fantasising about destroying the current system and replacing it with a more efficient and fair one for everyone. Admittedly, at the time I had gone over the top even claiming that I would have to burn down the UK parliament building in order to achieve my aims. Now though, I realise the value in winning democratically in order to bring reform. \n\nI can't say I was a communist, and I still can't really claim that. Rather, I like to think that one day I'll write my own manifesto, my own ideology. I'm not an anarchist, I'm not a communist, I'm not a liberal. If I were then I would be betraying my child-self. I'm a sympathiser to all of these ideologies. I had in the past said I was a communist, anarchist or socialist, but I don't want that now. It seems like these words provoke unnecessary conflict that could be easily avoided if we only just instituted what we as the collective thought was right for the people.","created_utc":1525502731,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"WizardBelly","body":"There's a lot to get to, and different types of communists disagree. The first thing is that there have historically been no \"communist\" countries. But this is a cop out, and we will include attempts at socialism. The most popular argument you will find on these subs is \"revisionism,\" or the making of capitalist reforms in socialist countries. In my opinion, if not for the larger issue of foreign interference, revisionism would not be a problem. So my main argument can be called \"foreign interference.\" A metaphor for it would be a tree that grows out of a crack in the sidewalk. Because it us strangled from the start, no matter how tall it grows, its base will be weak and all it takes is a small axe to make it fall. My main historical example will be the USSR. In 1917, after the October revolution, Russia was already under attack by the western countries. They put Russia under harsh economic blockade. At the time Russia was an agrarian country, Its main export power was mining and agriculture. Fast forward to 1930s. Stalin becomes the new leader. He is aware of the threat of military invasion. He also needs to industrialize Russia. However, there are no machines, and everyone works in the country side. The purpose of the first two fove year plans was to 1: collectivize agriculture to make using large farming tools possible, (which would increase demand for these tools), making agriculture more efficient and shifting peasents into cities. The plans also began the buildikg of steel manufacturing in the USSR. However, in order to get this equipment, Stalin's only available export was grain. So if he wanted to power up the USSR in time for the German invasion on the horizon, he would have to export some grain. Now in a perfect world, it would have been fine, but bad harvests, sabatoge by kulaks (wealthy peasants), poor communication, the selling of grain lead to some famines. The western media likes to inflate these famines, and blame it on selling off grain. Our argument is that the collectovozation worsened them, but the sacrifice was worth it. Although it may have been worth it in the eyes of people looming back, when Stalin died, his successor, Kruschev, was violently anti-Stalin, him and his succeasors ushered in more free market reforms until the USSR had to collapse. The effect of socialism was not negative in the USSR though. They beat the Nazis, put some folks into space, doubled the lifespan, educated and healthcareized everyone, and had no unemployment. But it was destined to collapse because foreign threats forced bad desocions. Another part I forgot is that Stalin's purges were not popular, but again, the only choice, when a strong government was needed but it was too busy arguing. Stories like this were most often what happened. I highly suggest you read Dr.Michael Parenti's book, blackshirts and reds, its pretty short and easy to read, its very well written, and very informative.","created_utc":1525527065,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

What does the minister think of going beyond capitalism? \"He concluded.\n\nDominique Anglade recalled the ties that his family had with Mr. Khadir and the philosophical discussions that his parents had with him.\n\n\"At the time of Plato, not sure that people lived in a good situation and there was a lot of poverty\", she retorted.\n\nThe minister conceded that we must continue to have reflections and that we have the right to question the system. However, it is not up to the government to interfere in the compensation of large companies, because there are already internal committees on this issue, she said.\n\n\"We have already lived without capitalism, it is true, but with what result? asked Mrs. Anglade.

{"author":"11-22-1963","body":"\"De-nuclearization\" is the western propaganda term. The truth is that the DPRK is now a full-fledged nuclear power, and nobody can revoke that status or force DPRK to forfeit. [Kim Jong-Un said as much in his speech](http:\/\/thesaker.is\/the-dprk-declares-itself-a-nuclear-power\/) to a plenary meeting of the Korean Worker's Party.\n\nThe other relevant countries (China, ROK, and Russia) are aware of this fact. And they are **all** well aware of what happened to Libya after Qadaffi was deceived by the West and forfeited his nuclear weapons program before a working warhead could be tested. \n\nFurther, de-nuclearization of the peninsula is really only an issue for the United States. ROK (South Korea) can build warheads over a couple weekends, probably. A \"threat\" is defined as intent to harm + capability to harm. It's no \"threat\" if there is no intent to harm, and DPRK is clearly responding to American aggression. \n\nSo what does this mean?  Simply put, DPRK is not on a \"de-nuclearization\" path; it will retain its nuclear power status. *However*, given that:\n\n* Its major goals of building a nuclear ballistic missile capable of striking the United States and its delivery  (miniaturization issue aside) have been met;\n\n* It has received security guarantees from China and possibly Russia;\n\n* The two Koreas are jointly participating in a peace process on their own initiative;\n\n...the DPRK will be open to talks with the US, but on its, and the other three parties' terms, I would assume. \n\nAll parties (China, Russia, ROK, DPRK) know well that US meddling could trigger an unwanted regional conflict. [Remember that Kim traveled to Beijing in March](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qHRbuKIdUDk), and around the same time, the [Chinese Defense Minister travelled to Russia](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O55sqD-A7jo) and gave a public message to the US about Chinese-Russian defense ties. \n\nI think the concurrency of these foreign trips means there's some co-ordination between Beijing, Moscow and Pyongyang here regards the Korean situation. DPRK wouldn't be so willing to \"talk\" with the US unless it had some aces up its sleeve or an upper hand of some sort. I fully expect that DPRK will be setting the terms of any future nuclear negotiations with the US, or at least largely influencing them. China and Russia will be listening.\n\nI don't think DPRK will \"de-nuclearize\", but there might be what's called a \"conditional shut down\" of its nuclear weapons program, absent its present nuclear arsenal. \n\nIn short, the phased withdrawal of US troops from South Korean bases and the freezing of US-ROK military drills are definitely two major conditions Kim has set out for such a negotiation, and he has the cards to play. \n\n","created_utc":1525735825,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"gedankenrausch","body":"Thank you for that recommendation. I'll come back when I read it.\nI would agree that making yourself unavailable for accumulation is a form of revolt, but in the current bourgeois capitalist society you also drop out of society because you're viewed as useless and addicted (less than a human). That makes it nearly impossible to turn a individual revolt  - as you already pointed out - to a collective revolution.\n\nI currently look into the idea that \"addiction\" is a concept that will individualize class struggle. People who suffer in capitalism try to make their life more bearable with drug consumption. Either they make themselves fit for work, have a better reproduction time or try to drop out completely. This is viewed as individual lifestyle and not as a struggle of a class to survive in capitalism. In addition addiction is also perceived as individual phenomena. Precisely then, when your 'lifestyle' does not conform with capitalist society (obviously culture also plays a major role). I like to remind that many drugs a relatively safe to consume, if you have enough money to afford the necessary surrounding. Addiction is not a biological fact, it is used as a tool of hegemony. A simple example: Look how drinking in the evening is viewed as okay, but in the morning is a sign of addictive behavior. This is clearly a social norm and has nothing to do with the drug itself.\nHowever, as you see this thought is still forming, I hope I could express some basic outlines.

This is because I differentiate between the drug itself and the mode\/method of drug consumption. For example I would say that alcohol is legal because there was already a long tradition of alcohol consumption established. However only certain modes of alcohol consumptions are 'okay', as long as the don't disrupt the workflow. Also we shouldn't forget the interests of industries. In Great Britian a Anti-MDMA campain was heavly sponsored by the alcohol industry because they thought their marketshare in danger.\nAnd lets not forget that even beer wasn't the best drink for a good workflow (but a neccessary food, water was mostly too dirty) since it contained a lot of drugs that induces hallucinations before the German Purity Law was introduced in 1516.","created_utc":1525776733,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Notable individuals whose ideas contributed to classical liberalism include John Locke, Jean-Baptiste Say, Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo. It drew on the economic ideas espoused by Adam Smith in Book 1 of the Wealth of Nations and on a belief in natural law, utilitarianism and progress.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/communism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1525794181,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

Though we can't exactly know what dominant relationship forms might exist under future communism we can guess that at least some people in a communist future would choose to freely engage in a lifestyle we'd call polyamory. \n\nModern communists should also be compatible with polyamory in the sense that strict adherence to bourgeois and sexist notions of marriage, family, relationships etc can only hold back socially transformative movements since people oppressed by those things can be a strong source of proletarian militancy and indeed can be among the most oppressed groups. Being judgmental in ways that enforce patriarchal relations alienates these people. At the same time however I would say that people who focus on polyamory in a lifestylist way and either think that engaging in it on its own is an inherently revolutionary act, or people that make advocacy of polyamory for all people a concern or goal are not compatible with the communist movement.\n\nUnder capitalism and patriarchy advocating \"free love\" and polyamory uncritically and without considering social context can lead to some messy problems (to be blunt men, whites, the wealthy etc are way more likely to be shitty in how they are polyamorous). There is definitely a way that advocacy of free love and polyamory is used to actually enforce patriarchy and gender based oppression. For instance: appeal to such notions has often been used to shame women who won't consent to things they are uncomfortable with as being \"sex negative\", conservative, not open minded, etc. Under patriarchy women have always had way more to lose by engaging in affairs, open relationships, etc. Under capitalism relationships have an unfortunate tie to financial matters and housing situations as well. There are plenty of other things to consider but that's just an example of how it's not as simple as some advocating forms of free love might want to believe.

{"author":"IanBurke","body":"I do not think full communism (the mode of production, which my first paragraph referred to, *not* the movement to create it which is what all my other paragraphs referred to) can even be established without the destruction of patriarchy as it exists now. As you suggest, feminism isn't just some afterthought to be stuck onto Marxism but a necessary and fundamental component (Marxist Feminist works bear this out, especially re role of reproductive labor etc, and I think the failure to fully understand this stuff was actually a very major problem of the 20th century communist movement) but what I was saying is that new economic relations will bring about new social relations (and vice versa) and so while I agree vestiges of the problems of capitalist patriarchy I described would exist throughout establishment of communism it would be hard to say \"full communism\" had been established as long as they did. But yeah many people calling themselves Marxist today don't see feminism as fundamental in this way and that is a big issue (and there are many bourgeois feminists unfortunately).  \n\nI also never meant to imply that communist organizations or socialist states are somehow immune to sexism and of course history and contemporary events proves that they are certainly not. As I said it's actually been one of the bigger problems of communist movements. Even full communism once established will not be the end of history. The problems would definitely be different though. At any point in a communist movement whether now, transitional periods or in the final establishment of full communism history will be weighing on people like a nightmare in one way or another and will need to be constantly struggled with.","created_utc":1525888659,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

When they were serving those sentences they lived a life comparable to that of other workers in those towns. \nThere\u2019s a good novel by John Scott called \u201cBehind the Urals\u201d where he discusses what the relationship between average worker and Kulak was like during the period of massive dekulakization. In general, life was tough for everyone during that time because they were trying to build the first industrial socialist society from the ruins of Tsarism and civil war.

Both sides have accused the other of sloppy or incompetent scholarship.\"\n\nAnd now here's a bit of the conclusion.\n\n&gt;\"THE LONG\\-AWAITED ARCHIVAL EVIDENCE ON REPRESSION in the period of the Great Purges shows that levels of arrests, political prisoners, executions, and general camp populations tend to confirm the orders of magnitude indicated by those labeled as \"revisionists\" and mocked by those proposing high estimates.\"\n\nEssentially, the paper found that the victims of the purges in the 1930s is much smaller compared to estimates. They also refuted the idea that the purges were targeted at a specific national group \\(although it did impact more than others\\) and that a majority of the prisoners were political \\(not true, most were probably just common criminals that would have been arrested in any western society\\).\n\nIf you don't have time to read all that, just scroll to the table on page 7. It shows the general GIST, with estimates being incredibly high compared to the actual documentable data. Keep in mind that the paper actually goes through the released Soviet archives to come to these conclusions. It also highlights how some of the data may be inaccurate, but it does reflect the magnitude of the whole thing.","created_utc":1526001282,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

The US still carries out penal labor sentences to this day. Further the highest number of Soviet penal laborers at one time was 2.5 Million.

Most of the people you're talking about \\(landowners and private capitalists\\) were arrested for resisting the socialization of their factories and especially farms. Special focus on this because many of them committed acts of sabotage, ruining fields, hoarding and burning crops, slaughtering livestock, that greatly contributed to the 1932\\-33 famine in Ukraine and southern Russia. Industrial sabotage also took place, as was even corroborated by American engineers that contracted with the USSR during that time to help them industrialize. \n\nIt should be noted that the collectivization of agriculture was widely supported and championed by the peasantry, as were the harsher penalties for former landowners. \n\nCan I recommend that you broaden your range of sources for historical information like this?

Also check out the pinned comment on the video\n\nHere is a transcript from an interview with charlene mitchell that explains her shift from the CPUSA:\n\n&gt;AC: I understand that some of the tensions within the party have also related to the race question? \n\n&gt;CM: Yes, this was another issue that came to a head when the National Committee discussed replacing Henry Winston and Gus Hall became the national chair. Our party has always had a leadership of black and white, and we fought for that. I believe that if that kind of leadership is not set then it shows that there is not the same interest in this question. Historically the African American question has been a very special question, central to all democratic struggles in our country. Gus Hall, giving the leadership, began to challenge the centrality of this issue. He argued that the class struggle was central and nothing else could be central. I am not suggesting that all of a sudden there was racism in the party, or that some people were mean, or anything like that. You had a situation where attention to certain questions that African American comrades felt were important, was downgraded. We used to have a magazine, a party magazine, called Black Liberation. Gus Hall was opposed to the term \"liberation\", on the grounds that \"liberation\" was \"tantamount to self-determination\". He argued that liberation was for nations, it was an \"inexact\" term in the US situation. It was at that time that Angela argued that the concept \"liberation\" was a more total concept than just equality, that it meant that there was a whole cultural identity that had to be plugged for, that the African American movement itself was a movement and it brought through to African Americans the whole question of freedom and not just of formal equality (because that was the position of any administration, that we all needed equal opportunity, and that was as far as we needed to go.) But that was never won. \n\n&gt;AC: Could you provide some background to the formation of the Committees of Correspondence with which you are now associated? \n\n&gt;CM: At the party convention, as you might know, a number of party districts had been denied their full complement of delegates. It was also decided by the outgoing top leadership of the party that anybody who (like myself) had signed a document entitled \"The Initiative to Renew and Unite the Party\", could not be in party leadership. As a result of that decision, a number of people who had heretofore been members of the CC were not nominated by the leadership to be part of the CC (National Committee, as we call it) ... \n\n&gt;AC: The leadership nominates? \n\n&gt;CM: Yes, this is the \"slate\" system. And every time I, along with most of the PB, had been part of this nominating system. But on this occasion we were excluded, although I was a delegate. So all of the leadership that had challenged the remaining leadership was denied. People like Herbert Aptheker, Franklin Alexander, Angela Davis, Danny Ruben, James Jackson, a good healthy part of the PB, were denied nomination. After the convention was over, we came together to assess what had happened at the convention. We agreed that we needed to find a way to keep together people who were so absolutely frustrated they would be leaving the party. And there would be other people who (like myself initially) would be staying on in the party, but didn't know what to do in the coming months. Then there were others who had not necessarily been in the party, but who were very close to the party, and whom we wanted to keep abreast. So we agreed to continue a network, to tell people what was going on in different parts of the country. Herbert Aptheker made the proposal to call the network Committees Of Correspondence, a name that goes back to 18th century and the time of the American Revolution. So we held a meeting, I think it was in February of 1992, and agreed to call a meeting in the summer of 1992. At that point we thought we would have about 400 people at such a meeting, in the end there were 1300. The Committees of Correspondence network is based around a newsletter, and our principle objective is to begin the patient task of rebuilding and reconnecting the left in the US.

Shortly after that we decided that what was really needed was revolutionary nationalism, that is, nationalism plus socialism. After analyzing conditions a little more, we found that it was impractical and even contradictory. Therefore, we went to a higher level of consciousness. We saw that in order to be free we had to crush the ruling circle and therefore we had to unite with the peoples of the world. So we called ourselves Internationalists. We sought solidarity with the peoples of the world. We sought solidarity with what we thought were the nations of the world. But then what happened? We found that because everything is in a constant state of transformation, because of the development of technology, because of the development of the mass media, because of the fire power of the imperialist, and because of the fact that the United States is no longer a nation but an empire, nations could not exist, for they did not have the criteria for nationhood. Their self-determination, economic determination, and cultural determination has been transformed by the imperialists and the ruling circle. They were no longer nations. We found that in order to be Internationalists we had to be also Nationalists, or at least acknowledge nationhood. Internationalism, if I understand the word, means the interrelationship among a group of nations. But since no nation exists, and since the United States is in fact an empire, it is impossible for us to be Internationalists. These transformations and phenomena require us to call ourselves \u201cintercommunalists\u201d because nations have been transformed into communities of the world. The Black Panther Party now disclaims internationalism and supports intercommunalism.","created_utc":1526319104,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

The moon landing requires a much larger rocket, which first has to go in orbit of earth, then head to the moon while keeping the astronauts alive for well over 3 days, then a lander module lands on the surface of the moon while the crew module stays in orbit. The lander crew does their job, then they have to take off and dock with the crew module, and then head back to Earth.\n\nThis is something the soviets never managed to do, and they lost to the US in long time human life in space, which is much more challenging than just sending people for a few hours in orbit\/sending probes to bodies, therefore proving that the US created a more advanced and more efficient space program.","created_utc":1526334552,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

You are right that Race is a social relation but it also applies to those actually white. These are primarily white men, harassing an African America woman, this dynamic is not acceptable.

See for example the relationship between Lenin's political line and Malinovsky, or on the other hand the BPP and the Newton\/Cleaver\/Seale line split. The RGA is acting like state agents because their extreme sectarianism, violent hypermasculinity, and inability to judge the correct tactics at a given moment to follow a coherent strategy make them absolutely scary to deal with. They are not the only party on the left who acts like this since the general decay of long existing parties leaves them with a few fanatics, but they are one which has become adept at social media toxic culture which makes them have some presence here. Whether this is the result of infiltration or not I will leave to the historians of the future.\n\nE: was the Asama-Sanso incident the result of state infiltration? It had an effect on the left far worse than anything the state could dream up. I don't think we'll ever know, so it's up to us to learn from it and ask larger questions.

Was someone being raped, right then at that moment?  Did they think that the PSL wouldn't do anything once McKinley was exposed?  Because it doesn't seem like they even gave the PSL the chance.

I don't know if this is true but they say that they also engage in community outreach.

{"author":"Tech4dayz","body":"As an IT guy that is looking to get into ethical hacking professionally in the near future, I think people are looking at the wrong aspects (not that I'm justifying this even a little bit). The privacy issue involving the software itself is minor, it's no more worse than any other cloud AV (as stated in the article). However not telling people and just rolling it out is against every standard in cyber security. By not doing so, they are violating the integrity, availability, and reliability of networks and machines and probably Service Level Agreements as well for that matter. \n\nIf you work in an environment like me, something just scanning your system without your consent can set off a lot of alarms and even shut entire services down (which did happen to a small degree where I work). In some cases (extremely secure networks like hospitals), incident response teams would even have to collaborate with law enforcement and everything locked down until it is determined that there is no threat before bringing servers back up.\n\nNot to mention it just creates another, highly unnecessary, possible attack vector. The second someone finds out how to exploit it (and someone certainly will, likely very quickly, and I'd even be willing to be it can be done with a simple javascript code from a rouge website) and gain remote access to a system, there are going to be hundreds of thousands successful hacks before it can patched.\n\nThe biggest issues with these big companies like google (Aside from general atrocities committed under a capitalist mode of production) is that they think it's okay to just keep piling services on top of services while giving little to no warning as to what these services are, do, can do, or can be forced to do with the right touch. Next thing you know, you have a half thought-out, originally open-source code turned proprietary in most cases, Agile developed application full of security holes and the consumer is the one paying for it by getting their information stolen, machines hacked, and just general inconvenience. Of course capitalist governments pretend like a fine is enough, but those fines are but a minuscule dent in the profit generated by their half baked software, particularly companies like google who make way more off of their data collection.\nIn cyber security we expect hacks to happen, it's literally Security+ level (a very basic certification for cyber security) information. It's part of the disaster plan, but that doesn't mean we want 3rd party companies pushing out extra software in the form of updates that can potentially be exploited. Especially software that is going to interrupt our workflow like a system scanner.\n\/rant\n\nFor those who want more privacy, I recommend firefox paired with duckduckgo search engine. You can use Tor, (I don't recommend it for casual users) don't expect to be invisible, and be wary of tracking onion sites run by FBI, CIA, etc. that are constantly poking holes in anonymity.","created_utc":1526494609,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

In popular neighborhoods, most serious disputes are solved by violent means, and workers find alien the method of phony compassion that liberal society prefers, a method that insists on using the proxies of the capitalist state to carry out violence that is actually even more severe. A petty crime between workers might be settled with a square go\u2014someone might get hurt or even have to get stitched up\u2014but this is nothing when stacked up against police intervention, with its unrestrained and sadistic brutality, the violence of long incarceration, or even death.\n\nThose growing up working class learn to settle disputes outside of the state's institutions of violence, and instead resort to their own direct violence.\n\n&gt; Needless to say, the proletariat and the petite bourgeoisie have notably different experiences of and conceptions about the role of violence in life, in the world, and in history. Every working-class person has experienced violence at some point in their life, whether in the streets, at school, at work, or at the hands of the police. *The petite bourgeoisie on the other hand can often live full lives into adulthood or old age without ever encountering violence directly*. For them violence is an aberration, an unfortunate random circumstance that happened to the wrong person. For us workers, violence is a fact of life that we adapt to or are broken by.\n\nHowever, to members of the petite bourgeoisie who haven't grown up resolving disputes with direct violence, this \"proclivity for violence\" is hard for them to understand.\n\n&gt; The working class is a class that by its very nature seeks discipline, and has an infinite creative potential for revolutionary violence. The proletariat is without a doubt the toughest class ever to have existed, because it is burdened with the responsibility of ending all classes. It exists to do away with itself, and so it is condemned to win.\n\nIs this the section you're talking about? By \"nature\" I think they're talking about the \"nature\" of the proletariat in the capitalist system, not like genetic destiny or some Nazi shit.\n\n&gt; The masses themselves, who belong to no communist party or pre-party formation, have shown the way forward, without prompting, while revisionists hang back, **wagging their fingers in disapproval**, mesmerized by the idealist illusions that they turn to out of their deep fear of violence, sacrifice, and struggle.\n\nSo, I dunno, are you sure you aren't inadvertently doing the bolded thing above?

People independent of the ominous state or politicians attacked institutions. Institutions like the Catholic Church and Orthodox Church are a problem , both of which were reactionary ( Support for the Tsar and the white army in the USSR , backing of the Francoist forces in Spain  and keeping anti-semitism alive in Poland). Religious or spiritual people are not a problem at all , they should be welcomed. \nLenin : \"Religion must be of no concern to the state, and religious societies must have no connection with governmental authority. Everyone must be absolutely free to profess any religion he pleases, or no religion whatever, i.e., to be an atheist, which every socialist is, as a rule. Discrimination among citizens on account of their religious convictions is wholly intolerable.

The clergy must obey the laws of the state, because these laws express the will of the working class and the working people. You must make the people quite clear about these laws and the hostility of the reactionary clergymen so that even that part of the population which believes in religion will clearly see that, under the guise of religion, the clergymen carry out activities hostile to the Homeland and the people themselves. Hence the people, convinced through facts and arguments, together with the Government, should struggle against the hostile clergy. You should isolate and condemn only those clergymen who do not obey the Government and commit grave crimes against the state. But, I insist, the people must be convinced about the crimes of these clergymen, and should also be convinced about the futility of the religious ideology and the evils that result from it.\"  \n (https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/archive\/hoxha\/works\/stalin\/meet3.htm )\n                                                                                                                                                                 \nEdit :I personally am a former catholic , now agnostic , but religion can be a very great learner.","created_utc":1526562925,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Just like syndicalism, it also sounds like a not unreasonable way to order parts of society, as well.\n\nI've been reading *Storming the Gates of Paradise* by Rebecca Solnit as well, which talks about cultural negation of indigenous people in America.

{"author":"closovsky","body":"Now, in 2002, the head of the Federal Reserve Bank, Alan Greenspan, one of those you should probably have studied at uni, then dubbed as the great maestro for apparently engineering a substantial economic boom, announced that \u2018financial innovations\u2019 i.e. derivatives of mortgage funds etc, had \u2018diversified risk\u2019 so that \u201cshocks to overall economic will be better absorbed and less likely to create cascading failures that could threaten financial stability\u201d.  Ben Bernanke, who eventually presided at the Fed over the global financial crash, remarked in 2004 that \u201cthe past two decades had seen a marked reduction in economic volatility\u201d that he dubbed as the Great Moderation. And as late as October 2007, the IMF concluded that \u201cin advanced economies, economic recessions had virtually disappeared in the post-war period\u201d.\n\nOnce the depth of the crisis was revealed in 2008, Greenspan told the US Congress, \u201cI am in a state of shocked disbelief\u201d.  He was questioned \u201cin other words, you found that your view of the world , your ideology, was not right, it was not working\u201d (House Oversight Committee Chair, Henry Waxman). \u201cAbsolutely, precisely, you know that\u2019s precisely the reason I was shocked, because I have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well\u201d.\n\nAnd there are more, from Martin Wolff of the Financial Times, to nobel prices like Joseph Stiglitz or John Kenneth Galbraith, which are still mainstream economists, who sees that neoliberalism, that purported by Tatcher or Reagan, that which we're still experiencing today, is nothing but a great fraud. (I'll avoid talking about Keynes here, no point) Meaning all that you studied, mathematical models and all, you can pretty much trow away.

{"author":"ZugNachPankow","body":"Simply put, Marxism uses historical materialism when analyzing society. Historical materialism is the idea that everything that happens in history, happens only because of *material* conditions, of things that you can see and touch. For an example, refer to the Manifesto of the Communist Party, \"The history of all hitherto [= \"until now\"] existing society is the history of class struggles\". This is in contrast with other philosophers, who claimed that society is driven by other forces.\n\nReligion does not agree with this view of history, because it says that history is influenced by other, non-material things (gods, spirits and so on). As a result, if one makes an analysis as a religious person, that analysis is probably not valid according to Marxism, because it includes immaterial causes (God) that do not agree with historical materialism, and this means that the religious person can have a wrong understanding of *why* something happened (eg. they might think that WWI was a product of the wrath of God, and not a product of imperialist tensions) and make wrong predictions.\n\nThe other paragraphs say that we communists shouldn't be *welcoming* to religion because it is in contrast with our view of the world, but maybe we can not talk about religion to people who are new to communism, especially because sometimes people rely on religion for moral support.","created_utc":1526594489,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"ASocialistAbroad","body":"At first, the gains of the revolution are protected by a \"vanguard\" party which takes control of the state and the means of production. The government must be democratic and worker-oriented so that the people have indirect control over the means of production. The party is necessary to guard against counterrevolutions. Over time, control of the means of production start to be transferred from the state directly to the workers, and the state withers away. In the end, we are left with a stateless society. \n\nI would imagine that relative to typical American expectations, a socialist state (in the transitional period) might be seen as having limitations on free speech and the press. Contrary to popular belief, the vast majority of speech, including criticism of the government, is usually allowed in actual socialist states. The line is usually drawn at attempts to undermine socialism or the revolution. A lot of socialist countries also heavily restrict political campaigning and lobbying. Note that every country has limits on speech. \n\nA common point-of-view on the left is that free speech is less democratic than it seems when you have a working class and a capitalist class. The people with the most money and power tend to have the loudest voices, and in the US, the candidate with the most campaign funding wins in over 90% of elections. In our eyes, these are instances where \"free speech\" undermines democracy rather than helping it. Bernie Sanders (who is not a socialist) made a good run by relying on small campaign contributions from tons of ordinary people, but it wasn't enough.

However, we must also recognize that their religion is incompatible with Marxism, and therefore their analyses are bound to contain errors which we must recognize. This is not unlike anarchists, which have interesting outlooks which we should study, but also commit doctrinal errors which we must recognize in their analyses.\n\n&gt;The victims of imperialism are these muslim people you seem to hate\n\nI don't hate muslims, but I recognize that their worldview is incompatible with Marxism.

Marxism is a universal doctrine. You're trying to frame this into a west-vs-muslims conflict where there is none.\n\nAnyway, I wouldn't go as far as claiming they're \"not true communists\", but they're certainly unorthodox communists, whose ideas do not agree with Marxism. I have no doubt that many of them are communist deep down, but they commit a doctrinal error in adhering to idealistic doctrines and applying them in communist analyses.\n\n&gt;a brown feminist communist revolutionary muslim is somehow a subject of discussion that seeks to criticize her rather than praise her. \n\nGood comrades are not exempt from criticism. Rather, as communists we should know that criticism is important to set a correct party line.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't criticize her is if democratic centralism applied. However, we're not part of the same party (and I don't know if her party applies democratic centralism), so it does not apply.\n\n&gt;This is more than orientalism, racism, this is sexism to brown muslim Women.\n\nThis is so out of context that I'm questioning your sincerity in your accusation.

It would also further taint the reputation of the spy agency, which has long been accused of meddling in domestic politics and fabricating espionage cases in the name of fighting the communist North.\n\n\u201cI want to go home, because living like this is not the life I wanted,\u201d said one of the three women, who were all interviewed by JTBC. \u201cI miss my parents.\u201d\n\nJTBC did not reveal the names of the three women and also blurred their faces, as well as Mr. Heo\u2019s, to protect their identities. But it showed what it said were copies of the 12 women\u2019s North Korean passports, as well as their flight reservations when they left China.\n\nYou have 4 free articles remaining.\n\nSubscribe to The Times\nSouth Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry is checking \u201cthe new allegations,\u201d its spokesman, Baik Tae-hyun, said on Friday.\n\nBut Mr. Baik admitted that when his ministry announced in 2016 that the women had arrived in South Korea of their own free will, it was just relaying information it received from the intelligence agency.\n\nThe National Intelligence Service said it was \u201cclosely reviewing\u201d the JTBC report. Until now, the agency has dismissed as North Korean propaganda allegations that the women were taken to the South against their will.\n\nThe case of the 12 women, all in their 20s or 30s, presents a thorny problem for President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, who held a summit meeting with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, last month to discuss improving ties. Mr. Kim\u2019s government has long demanded the women\u2019s repatriation. But the South has always denied abducting North Koreans, saying that about 30,000 North Koreans who have arrived in the South since the 1990s were defectors.\n\nThe women were among tens of thousands of North Koreans working abroad who funnel badly needed foreign currency to their government. The North selects loyal and relatively affluent citizens to send abroad as workers, and the defection of the 12 women was a major coup for Park Geun-hye, who was South Korea\u2019s president at the time and whose conservative government cited it as a sign of disillusionment with Mr. Kim among North Korean elites.\n\nBut many details of the defection remained a mystery and fueled suspicion, including how the restaurant workers managed to plot their escape despite being trained to spy on one another for signs of disloyalty. They also arrived in South Korea only two days after they fled their restaurant in the Chinese city of Ningbo, in the eastern province of Zhejiang. Other defectors usually took months to complete the trip to South Korea, often trekking through the jungles of Southeast Asia with the help of human traffickers.\n\nMs. Park\u2019s government also took the highly unusual step of announcing their defection the day after their arrival. But it kept their whereabouts secret and blocked human rights lawyers from meeting with them. It also denied the North\u2019s claim that the waitresses\u2019 manager had conspired with the South Korean spy agency to take them to the South after telling them that they were being relocated to a restaurant in Southeast Asia.\n\nBut Mr. Heo says that was exactly what happened. Like other North Korean workers abroad, the women were trained to obey their manager, who held their passports.\n\n\u201cI just told them that we were moving to a new place,\u201d he told JTBC.\n\nMr. Heo said he decided to spy for the National Intelligence Service in 2014 after Kim Jong-un executed his own uncle, Jang Song-thaek, on sedition and corruption charges. Mr. Heo said he became disillusioned with Mr. Kim after five of his former classmates were executed in a purge of officials close to Mr. Jang.\n\nMr. Heo said he met a South Korean agent in a motel in China, signed a letter of allegiance, and had his picture taken with a South Korean flag as proof that he would not betray the agency.\n\nBut his spying was exposed in 2016, and when he asked his contact at the National Intelligence Service to help him defect, the official ordered him to bring the women with him. Mr. Heo said he was promised big rewards, like a medal and a government job.\n\n\u201cHe said this was an operation approved by President Park and everyone was waiting for me,\u201d Mr. Heo said of his contact at the intelligence agency. \u201cHe threatened that if I did not bring the women with me, he would report me to the North Korean Embassy.\u201d\n\nThe three women interviewed by JTBC said they \u201cnever imagined\u201d they were being taken to South Korea.\n\nOnly when they landed in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Mr. Heo took them to the South Korean embassy by taxi did they realize that something had gone wrong, they said.\n\nWhen they balked at entering, they said Mr. Heo threatened to tell the North Korean authorities that they often watched South Korean movies in China, a serious crime for North Korean workers abroad.\n\n\u201cI blackmailed them and told them to make a choice: \u2018If you return home, you die, and if you follow me, you live,\u2019\u201d Mr. Heo said. \u201cI am now remorseful for what I did.\u201d\n\nInside the embassy, the women signed statements that they were defecting of their own free will.\n\nThey said working in China had been their dream because they could earn in a month what they made in a year in North Korea. It was also their only chance to travel outside their isolated, impoverished country.\n\nNow in South Korea against their will but unable to return home, they said that they have struggled to adjust, attending schools, working part-time jobs and learning to speak with a South Korean accent. They said they hid their identities and refused until now to reveal their ordeal to avoid harming their parents in the North, where families of defectors are often treated as traitors.\n\n\u201cIt has been so hard for me because I wanted to tell my parents that I am O.K., but I can\u2019t,\u201d one woman said.\n\nMr. Heo said he decided to speak out because after he defected, President Park was impeached and the intelligence agency never gave him the rewards it had promised. He said he also realized, after arriving in the South, that the timing of the group\u2019s defection was moved up more than a month to help rally conservative votes in parliamentary elections.\n\n\u201cThey had me believe that this was a big patriotic operation,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they used me and then shot me in the back.\u201d\n\n","created_utc":1526785322,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"whatsunoftruth","body":"First of all, I strongly urge you to delete your post in [r\/Vietnam](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Vietnam). The subreddit will only give you shitty answers. The best ones came from [u\/jp16103](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/jp16103) and [u\/baozebub](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/baozebub); the former being an actual Marxist, and the latter not at all. The rest of the comments there, ignore them. They're bullshit.\n\nI'll try to answer to answer your question as concisely as possible, since you're asking a really big question.\n\nThe state currently has a monopoly, or a near\\-monopoly in all of the commanding heights of the economy \\- this gives the state the leverage to reign in the private sector. In the state sector, production is planned. However, because of the market reforms, decision making powers were decentralized, and profitability targets started to exist. Doesn't mean that state enterprises are forced to maximize profits like private ones, so no the law of value isn't the regulator of production in these sectors. This can be seen through how state enterprises make unprofitable investments in poor areas to develop the infrastructure, how prices of essential commodities are controlled and often completely escape the pattern of prices on the global market \\(e.g Vietnamese petrol prices\\), or how heavy industry enterprises are permitted to make losses that are described as \"losses according to plan\". State enterprises are very rarely allowed to go bankrupt, and can't even hire and fire at will \\(there's still an \"iron rice bowl\"\\).\n\nAs for economic planning, in some industries \\(such as telecommunications\\), long\\-term planning over the span of 5 years is replaced with shorter\\-term planning over the span of 1 year \\(with the reforms currently in place, long\\-term planning would be difficult, if not impossible\\). However, in some industries, such as coal mining, 5\\-year plans continue to be used.\n\nThe state owns all the land. You can pay to obtain land usage rights \\- which is transferable through buying and selling. There's an entire market for this. On surface this looks like \"owning\" the land, but there are considerable restrictions that make it not at all the same as outright ownership. For example, since the state is the actual owner, it retains the right to \"seize\" land usage rights so that construction conforms to urban planning, and the economic plans. In other words, the state can give you the right to use land, the state can take it away. With compensation of course, but capitalists often complain that the compensation doesn't match \"market\" prices \\- which isn't really \"market prices\" at all since the state also control the prices of these transferable land usage rights. You also can't use the natural resources found under the land.\n\nThe \"private sector\" is nothing like what Westerners imagine it to be i.e full of capitalist corporations. Proper capitalist companies actually constitute a minor part of Vietnam's private sector. \"Private industry\" in Vietnam is mostly composed of local markets where farmers and fishermen sell their surplus; street vendors; small family\\-owned stores and restaurants. Privately owned manufacturing \\(domestic and foreign\\) is concentrated in light industry, since heavy industry is controlled by the state. The idea is to attract foreign investment to access modern technology \\(since Soviet aid is no longer there, and the state doesn't have that much money\\), and then attempt to carry out technology transfer. Has this been successful? Well, not really...\n\nIn agriculture, cooperative farming is mostly abandoned, with individual farming taking its place. In the short run this seem to have incentivized the peasantry to increase production, but in the long run this obstructed the process of mechanization, so agriculture in Vietnam is plagued with issues with regards to inefficiency.\n\nOverall, it's like the NEP in Russia, only more extensive, with all the problems that NEP\\-type reforms would entails.\n\nIf you narrow down your question, I can give you primary sources.","created_utc":1526792064,"score":14,"subreddit":"communism"}

Similarly to Stalin, Xue considered the productive forces to be primary and that this was a fundamental universal law of economics. Unlike Stalin, Xue believed there were principles that guided the socialist transition, the key one being the principle of \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his work\"; this principle would guide socialist development, even when China had reached advanced socialism, and would be replaced with \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need\" only when there existed general abundance.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Primary_stage_of_socialism","created_utc":1526848402,"score":10,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"amerikkkan_alien","body":"\"The victims of America domestically include; African Americans, Muslims, Mexican immigrants, Women of color, &amp; the LGBTQ community.\" This is referring to the victims of America in general, not school shootings. The victims of Americas wicked domestic policies such as \"War on Drugs\" Police brutality, gentrification, etc. It is to make a point that true victims are never the ones shooting up schools.\n\nAgain, the victims of the crime don't necessarily have to be black or brown. White males are more likely to snap, kill and murder due to rejection, or bullying due to their racial privilege in which they never take \"no\" for an answer. Today the story came out that the Sante Fe shooter specifically targeted a girl who rejected his sexual advances and he murdered her. That connects with the toxic masculinity part as well. Racial privilege is a huge force in why all these school shooters are white, as I said in another comment; black and brown kids go to schools where they have guns and weapons on them everyday because they live in the projects; yet no school shootings occur. There is a dynamic between race, privilege, power and violence. The more privileged one is racially, they less they will deal with \"no\" for an answer or rejection; as minorities have to deal with this all the time and they don't shoot up schools because of it. Whites in America are more likely to snap and kill because they don't like someone due to their racial privilege, due to the culture that surrounds them, due to their own wicked ideologies. The white supremacist act is the fact that they have to take out their rage on innocent people, not necessarily meaning that their victims will be of color.

{"author":"nearlyoctober","body":"Yep I agree. At the moment we should orient ourselves to exhausting all peaceful avenues towards socialism. Marx and Engels thought that at their time the U.S. could achieve transition without a violent uprising, and that alone should give pause to the fresh faces eager to blow shit up. I was talking to a Chinese friend and they remarked that, in light of Mao saying that \"many more cultural revolutions\" would be necessary to secure communism, they were very hopeful that widespread violence was not on the agenda (particularly within China itself). I mention this because when addressing this question we have to consider not just the regional political and economic developments (within the U.S.) but also the modern global power of the proletariat. I think most people here have an immature evaluation of both questions and so their conclusions are equally immature. Not to say that my own analysis has sufficiently matured but at the very least we should all agree that the question of violence is not one that can be settled once-and-for-all, but rather a question whose correct answer corresponds to a particular moment in time.","created_utc":1526936135,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

I feel however that Tsvangirai's clique will be powerless without him around. The destruction of Mugabe's government and forcing Grace Mugabe out of power sort of killed the last gasp of socialism in Zimbabwe. A good friend of mine was at the World Youth Conference in Sochi and met people from ZANU-PFs youth wing just a few months before the coup. He described them as being socialists who were committed to returning ZANU-PF to its socialist roots by any means necessary.\n\nWhenever the next elections happen, I figure that the MDC and maybe the revived UANC will come back around given that there's another Muzorewa leading it again, but I don't generally feel positively about UANC. I know Muzorewa's son, he was a professor of mine at university and a firm Pan-Africanist as is his father, but I don't see his dad's election bid to be as successful as he wants it to be. The corruption and poor leadership from Mnangagwa, as well as his attempts to appease imperialist forces outside of Zimbabwe such as the U.S. and Britain. The stated interest in joining the Commonwealth is what concerns me the most, given that Britain on the edge of Brexit shows no signs of beginning the necessary re-industrialization required for them to properly exist outside of the EEC\/EU. If an old Tory imperialist like Jacob Rees-Mogg becomes Prime Minister after May(which I feel is likely), the British government will jump at the chance to bring Zimbabwe into the commonwealth and then exploit the ever-loving-fuck out of them. \n\nAs to your final paragraph, yeah, I generally agree with you there too. The ethnic tensions will pop up again, and eventually there will be resistance of some kind. Whether or not the then government of Zimbabwe will be able to retain power and stamp it out is a different story. Mnangagwa was involved in the *gukrahundi*, so he knows how that game is played, but that might irritate some liberal imperialists in Britain and elsewhere. There's just a lot up in the air right now, and it is a crucial time for Zimbabwe's future.

It's easier enjoy the material benefits of slaughtering, super-exploiting and imprisoning non-whites at home and abroad when there's a black\/progressive face on it, much like how 'feminist' pornography or 'fair trade' capitalism make it easier to enjoy the material benefits of misogyny and imperialism.","created_utc":1527094104,"score":14,"subreddit":"communism"}

Once you begin to organize, the sense of solidarity will be invaluable and you will begin to be able to gain a true measure of the success of a movement.

Instead, present thought experiments or metaphors for the arguments you have, and then cite Marx as a source in the academic language to solidify the core lesson of that experiment or metaphor.\n\nThe thought experiment I've used most recently is to explain the labor theory of value, which most people overwhelmingly seem to think is bunk and void because, \"prices are determined by demand, ergo the subjective theory of value better explains how we ascribe value to goods and services.\"\n\nSo as I thought experiment, I propose you to think of an iPhone, consider what does into it. You have aluminum, copper, a bunch of rare earth metals, etc all of which you theoretically could walk\/swim to, dig up yourself and then make the tools needed to form an iPhone, and then make the actual iPhone, however this would likely require you to swim across the Atlantic for to the Congo for most of the resources, then walk to somewhere with a significant steel deposit to make the smelting equipment, etc (see where I'm going here?) If iPhones just grew on trees, in some proverbial \"Garden of Eden\" where everything was available to you on demand, you would never pay for anything, I mean, why would you? It's free. However, we don't live in a Garden of Eden, someone has to dig up those materials, transport them to the assembly location, assemble it then transport them to the sales location, then staff, protect and maintain the sales location etc. All of this labor has generated the actual thing of value, and by extension, the value itself, your *purchase* of the item is subjective, you have to weigh whether or not you figure it more worthwhile to pay for someone else to do the labor for you, or to go do the labor yourself, but the weighing of the value of something is necessarily based on the amount of labor that went into it vs the amount of labor you'd have to put into it.\n\nThis is just one example, but like I said, use a thought experiment or a metaphor to make an argument more palatable.","created_utc":1527155836,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

Do you think that, by what that person's activities are and the working hours he has, he deserves a paycheck tens, hundreds, maybe thousands of times of yours? Don't you think that those people, even though their importance may be evident, should be paid something much more in line with your salary?\n\nYou are allowed just enough money by the elite and rich to have just enough and maybe a little more. Just enough to keep you content with what you have and giving you the idea that you have things to lose. People don't do uprisings and riots when they have a house and a car to lose. People start rioting when they have little to nothing to lose. Elites want you to think that you have things to lose, so that you won't stop working for a low wage for them in favor of an uprising. Elites want to scare you into partaking in this society by threatening you to take away the things you don't want to lose, which they can by firing you and not having to pay you any more salary. In the meantime, they sit on their lazy ass in a chauffeured car going from golf course to golf course, while you are making money for their companies to sustain their lifestyle. \"\n\nGetting people into the idea of unjust treatment will hold their attention.

Learning about cultural hegemony when I turned communist was easy for me given the ideological bubble I used to take comfort in back when I was mormon. Still have to deal with it every time I visit them. Luckily I can find some comfort escaping that bubble, I can't say the same about the liberal bubble.\n\nI was an econ major but I had to switch. I tried pushing through it but the material was far more ideology than science. I challenged my professors when they discussed problems easily solved with planning but the reply was always ideological not scientific: \"We only look at bottom up systems, not top down systems.\" What's worse, to my horror I discovered not a single one of them had the slightest idea what Marxism, socialism or communism were all about. It was at that point I realised I was wasting my time. I was being presented ideology masked in shallow oversimplified equations and graphs. What's even more scary is that one if my professors, the most ignorant and reactionary of them all is heading to Burma next week to advise its leaders on economic matters! We're talking a woman who advocates child labor and prostitution for their economic benefits. I wish I was exaggerating. \n\nI switched to international relations because the program has an openly communist professor but it's still extremely frustrating dealing with the liberal censorship. The professors fetishize liberal democracy while skimming over or just not mentioning American war crimes, our genocides and the millions we've killed. The history is completely whitewashed and biased as fuck. Like you I've had some luck getting support from classmates who're not from the West but there are very few of them and their voices are generally dismissed. I'm thinking of getting a masters in some field in public policy but I have no idea where I'll go from there. \n\nFrankly I feel this nations culture is slowly suffocating me. \n\n\n","created_utc":1527161434,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

One was Elzbieta Gondek, one of the top 100 people in the world for migration studies, and at the time deeply embedded in Washington, working on migration policy. She gave a powerpoint presentation about the resettling of Bosniaks in Camp David, and put up the symbol of UCK, the armed wing of the Bosnians. My Serbian friend (who lost family in the war) burst into tears and left the classroom, at which point this extremely powerful woman turned to the class and said \"Oh, she's just politically opposed to refugee resettlement.\"\n\nI lost my goddamn mind, and explained to her how every single word she had said was politically charged but she couldn't see it due to her own ideological blindness. She told me that anyone is free to express their views in the USA, they even let Nazis march in the streets!\n\nThis is clearly bad logic, and I told her that the Americans pick and choose people from abroad to let in, and then feel comfortable with their political expressions. They have freedom internally because they deny freedom externally. It's all determined by how they expressed themselves before, no North Vietnamese were allowed to resettle in the USA.\n\nShe had nothing. The class ended in acrimony, her presentation was cut short, and she left. One of the most powerful women in our field could not answer a basic question about freedom and migration.

Not to mention having your biggest events be romanticizing fragments of the working class that aren't anywhere near your politics at liberal-run protests every few months.\n\nIf you can't put a community garden together you aren't going to be  a vanguard party. That's being a bit harsh, but it's a reality. And obviously we all have jobs (*sometimes*), we all have responsibilities, we're just doing what we can. The goal should be to advance towards socialism. And that starts with baby steps. But it doesn't start with whining and crying over useless and unappealing arguments to people. And there's obviously a realm for disagreement, discussion, and even damnation of bad ideas. But that shouldn't be our chief task.\n\nNot that a community garden should be the end-all-be-all of Marxism, but if you only got time for one thing it's a lot better than bickering on reddit or on phone calls.\n\nSo overall I think we should be working in building something successful (even if it is something small, borderline liberal, and reformist) and then watching to see people get interested, get so excited over these complicated issues. Marxism is really interesting, even to non-Marxists. But it may not seem like an attractive way to spend your time if what you're inviting people to is an appearance of incompetent organizers trying to dissect and bicker over complicated texts. But if the Marxist organization is successful, more-or-less respected in the community (which might be *a* community such as a community of color or LGBTQ+ folks, don't worry about the Mayor liking you), then you'll get people asking \"What's Marxism about?\" and then you can begin to help them. And I think it's important to note, at least from what I've seen, most people who do become Marxists from the organizing I've done do the bulk Marx research on their own. So it's not going to be too critical to hold anybody's hand in their political development.

If you can bankrupt a capitalist, take it over and turn it into cooperative, that's good.\n\n&gt; Would it be hard in the age of kickstarter ect to get people to contribute money to a project and then have all profits evenly split?\n\nthis sounds like paying out dividends from profits to investors, profits come stealing a share of worker wages, so no.\n\nhotels do not make \"super-profits\" that come from being able undercut the market with technical inventions improving labour productivity, most of your cost are fixed like rent, wages and consumable supplies. In general the service sector is almost immune to productivity gains, even gains from stuff like-room cleaning assistance robots would likely end up being captured by landlords via rent increases and the robot production corporations who will rent those out like coin-operated-soda-can-dispenser-automates. (Forget about buying land in a \"touristable\" region, if rely on crowd-funding for investment capital)\n\nIf you want to push for conversion into cooperatives in the hotel sector, try to capture the usually externalized stuff like laundry services first, and you have to realize that you need to not only convert one hotel but also all the local competition, because you cannot compete against private capital reserves without it turning into self-exploitation. \n\nKeep in mind that the end goal is to increase the share of workers at the expense of capital. Do not try to increase the size of the economy by building something new, under capitalism, you need massive amounts of capital for that. Do not try to out-compete capitalists, competition = reduction wages, especially in the service sector. \n\nIf you can capture and covert a small region to cooperatives merge them remove as many financial links as possible, so you can survive crisis cycles better, to avoid the moral loss of layoffs. You might want to set up a pretend capitalist business seeking to attract ideological investment to out-compete the cooperative, that just happens to fail and sell off all the capital at bargain prices to the cooperative, that's how you can grow at the expense of capital. Try to cut off dependencies to capitalism (you know deny the leverage) and spread the model if you can. Avoid holding fictitious capital like stocks &amp; shares it's not worth expending labour on this, there simply are not stores of value, not yellow metal nor papers with company names on them. And remember the rules in capitalism , everything you an get way with is just standard operating procedure.\n\nNot that any of this would bring about communism, and unless you go for serious predator mode and are too big to be swallowed you'll get overrun by some giant corporation with giant war-chest. looking to \"capture a new market\" down the line. \n\nAlso if you don't have the stomach to look at the destruction of humans that accompanies prostitution don't go for hotels.\n\nIf you want to get to communism, capture the state and expropriate all capitalists, build lower stage socialism, or at least go for key industries,  find a way to deny resources or talent, rather than the services sector,  you know strategically speaking hotels are not really relevant.\n","created_utc":1527192613,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

In which case closure of the existing testing facility would be considered normal and in no way attributed to any kind of denuclearization process.\n\n2) It may be that the DPRK no longer requires explosive detonation of nuclear materials in order to further their development of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems. Most countries whom have progressed as North Korea have, eventually discontinue physical weapon discharge as part of a normal development pattern and instead move on to computer simulation modeling to ensure weapon safety and delivery.

{"author":"Angryactor91","body":"Late response but Ive a bit of experience from local activism. Im also an actor who's used local arts scenes to engage people politically in a metropolitan area, so hopefully my two pence worth helps. \n\nu\/aldo_nova makes a good point. Sales people sell products by tailoring their pitch to the person. What does that person want or need? No point telling a person who doesnt read and loves reality tv about the 'means of production'. You'll lose them immediately. Find out what their job is...how are they being exploited? If they're employed, ask them about the wage their boss\/shareholders make for the work they do vs the work they do and wage they earn. If they're self employed, ask about the lack of state support. If they're ubemployed, ask them what they think of the job market. Dont use marxist jargon, but *do* keep relating it back to Marx (without using the name Marx) . Example i once did: \"Fuck yeah it seems everyone is struggling to get work nowadays. Ever think thats on purpose? So they can pay workeing people less? Can hardly ask for better pay when they're always looking to fire you and hire another.\" (Soooo much more effective than \"but theres a reserve army of labour! Marx predicted it!!\") \n\nAs u\/HappyHandel said, there is a danger of dumbing down...but it's also important to recognise when speaking to someone if they are well read in marxist literature or not. I am not a fan of football (soccer as the yanks call it) so when people speak about obscure teams\/terms\/championships...i stop caring. But speak to me in terms of it being an event\/cultural, then im in (because im an actor and love performance) . \n\nBasically as u\/happyeconomics said...keep it simple! I would add that you can tailor it to that person, then you're golden. \n\nI'd recommend to watch the movie *Pride* . It tells the true story of LGBT groups in 1980s Britian supporting the Miners Strike at a time when the mines are being closed by the government. The LGBT groups support the Miners despite the massive homophobia of the time...and as a result, the Miners end up supporting LGBT groups in a MASSIVE way - much to the dismay of the government and press. \n\nThe motif of the film? A Welsh strike leader says to an LGBT striker - 'Hold out your hand. Now i put my hand in yours. Thats the old labour symbol. It means \"I support you, you support me\" . Yoy've had our back...we'll always have yours.\" \n\n\nThe point of my rant - in your activism you'll find people different to you wanting different things...that's an amazing thing to be celebrated. Listen to people you meet - help them in their struggles, and they will join you. Socialism, Communism and The Left all pride themselves on Unity over individuality. Dont preach, but listen and help and you will change the world. We outnumber the 1%, we just need to come together. We can do it!\n","created_utc":1527211679,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

Cool, just fire back jokes and simple stock retorts. That's all they're giving you.\n\n If they ask honest questions or escalate it to more nuanced arguments, then ask if they want a serious conversation and address that the arguments they are producing are literally just propaganda of a system they've lived in. \n\nOtherwise dont give evidence or complex arguments. Somebody telling you 'cuba is poor' when it has a healthcare system that us in the UK are jealous of, are not the kind of people who will listen to coherent and thought out reasoning. \n\nGive effort where it is due.

{"author":"ahorsenamedwhimsical","body":"So I was flipping through this 1935 edition I own earlier and just today noticed the name printed on the cover, bottom right. Initially, I thought Jerry Wagner was a full name, but after doing some digging, I think this book might have actually belonged to Esther Jerry Wagner, who was named as a member of the communist party in the House Committee on Unamerican Activities hearings during testimony by Babette Lang in 1955. This seems especially likely because Lang refers to Esther as \u2018Jerry Wagner\u2019 without prompting when she\u2019s asked. I found what I\u2019m pretty sure is her obit, and it rather humorously refers to her as firstly being an \u2018activist\u2019.

I became a communist when I was 14 and when I first began I was eager to spread the wonderful wealth of new knowledge I had found in Marx and Lenin, but as most people are socialized to believe their ideas are at best utopian idealism and at worst genocidal evil, I had very limited success.\n\nMy advice to you is, instead of trying to make fliers or posters etc. instead, try looking for people who seem, \"lost.\" There are plenty of people who are having a rough time in life, particularly at a frustrating age like your time in middle school that are just now developing a political identity for the first time (actually that's usually in the later years of high scholl, but good on you for being ahead of the curve).\n\nFind someone who's at a loss, confused, maybe even hurting really bad, and be a friend to them. They'll be far more receptive to your message if you show them solidarity, and are far more likely to accept your solution if they actually see the problem.\n\nThis was what ultimately won more converts over for me than just plastering posters all over the place.\n\nIf you are dead set on fliers though, I'd recommend you make some easy to understand material debunking one of the most integral strawman arguments against communism peddled to us from a young age, what I call: the grade argument.\n\nThis is the argument that goes, \"if everyone were taking a test and 3 people worked really hard and got As, but then a 4th person didn't study all that hard and I just gave everyone a B, that wouldn't be far would it?\"\n\nYou need to explain how communism isn't just \"everyone getting paid the same amount\" that's a strawman. You need to introduce them to the idea of workplace democracy, so try flipping this example on its head, \"if 4 people were in a group project, 1 person bought all the materials but did none of the research or work, and then turned in the final project to get all the credit even though they didn't actually put in the effort, that wouldn't be fair would it?

Futures trade because certain parties need protection from price fluctuation. Those parties are anyone from the lowly farmer that wants to ensure an even profit, to large corporate airlines that rely on a fixed cost of fuel to run their razor sharp margin business. Short selling and futures brokerage allows speculative players to assume all of the price risk for these parties in exchange for ensuring a more liquid market to the players that have to buy\/sell at any price.\nTrading is NOT a money funnel to the bank account of the trader, and like any business the trader has to manage their margins as well.\n\nIt still reeks of capitalism, but id argue that exchanges are the greatest equalizer in our flawed system because anyone can participate.\n\nedit: To address the way in which the article, and its reference material, is out of touch.

{"author":"eaterofclouds","body":"I don't think the answer is as murky as some people have made it out to be. Revisionism is a fundamental alteration to the basic principles of Marxism (or, more specifically, M-Leninism). If you want to examine whether social and economic reforms made by the PR.C, Vietnam, Laos, the DPR.K, Cuba -- or for that matter, any socialist state -- are revisionist, then you should examine the justifications behind those reforms. Has the reform been justified by a fundamental alteration to Marxism? Or has it been justified within the established framework of scientific M-Leninism? Has the ruling party made contributions to ML that add to the legacy of past ML thinkers, or contributions which contradict and subtract from their legacy? \n\nDid Khrushchev add to Stalin's theoretical and practical contributions, or did he viciously repudiate him, excise him from the history-books, and deny his relevance to ML? What did the CCP do to Mao, during Deng's leadership? Deng explicitly stressed that he would not do to Mao what Khrushchev did to Stalin, and the CCP since has emphasised *adding to* and enriching the contributions of previous thinkers rather than breaking with them. The fact that as of today, the correctness of Mao Zedong Thought is consistently reaffirmed by state media, by the CCP itself, and by the education system from the secondary to tertiary level, should tell you whether the Mao-Deng relationship is the same as the Stalin-Khrushchev relationship.\n\nHas the Doi Moi in Vietnam been justified by a contra-Marxist revision? No, the CPV is candid in saying that its \"socialist-oriented market economy\" is not ideal, and was a policy forced by post-war material conditions. Michael Karadjis [discusses](https:\/\/www.greenleft.org.au\/content\/vietnam-30-years-after-victory-towards-capitalism-or-socialism) these conditions:\n\n&gt;The Vietnamese Revolution inherited a country destroyed by the most massive armed assault in history, yet was denied US reparations. Then the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia launched a brutal three-year war against Vietnam, until Vietnamese troops went in to help liberate the Cambodian people. The US, China and Thailand armed the Khmer Rouge along the Thai border, while an embargo was imposed on Vietnam by the imperialist powers, the right-wing Asian regimes and China. China invaded Vietnam in 1979, and though driven back, forced Vietnam to keep half a million troops on its northern border and double the size of its armed forces.\n\n&gt;The catastrophic inflation that resulted almost forced the collapse of the system based on state-owned enterprises and rural cooperatives. The collapse of the Soviet bloc was the coup de grace, cutting Vietnam off from its major source of international aid, trade and technical assistance. Only by moving to market mechanisms was Vietnam able to take advantage of the end of the Cambodian war and international embargo in 1989 to push exports and bring in foreign capital to avert collapse.\n\nApply the same line of thinking to Special Economic Zones in the DPR.K and small businesses in Cuba. Should we be surprised that the forcible dissolution of the USSR, producing a US-dominated hyperimperialist unipolar world, forced many socialist countries to reconsider their prior path towards communism?\n\nAllow me to respond to a possible counter in advance. This counter would go along the lines of: \"if these communist parties have justified reforms using Marxism-Leninism, that doesn't matter, because with enough wordplay you can justify anything within Marxism-Leninism\", or something not so obvious. \n\nMarxism-Leninism is correct and scientific. You can't justify a flat Earth within the framework of modern physics, and you can't justify the existence of souls within the framework of modern biology. No more can you justify an incorrect, unscientific anti-Marxist revision within the framework of Marxism-Leninism. If a party is *applying and using* ML to solve real problems, then no amount of nonsense asserting that that party is filled with \"fake communists\" conspiratorially orchestrating a capitalist restoration all while using pseudo-ML duckspeak, should be able to convince you otherwise.","created_utc":1527286175,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"corvibae","body":"I'm of the opinion that school shootings and other mass casualty events are side effect, if you will, of the social alienation which is intrinsic to capitalism. This alienation, combined with toxic masculinity leads to violence. The shooter feels separate from other people, alienated from the society and people around him, and he is angry. He wishes to do punish the people for \"hurting\" him in this way. The masculinity aspect of these shootings\/MCIs comes in here, after the idea of punishing the society at-large comes into play, he then considers that he is a man. Men, in capitalist society, commit acts of violence as the norm and for the most part go totally unpunished. He's a man, theoretically speaking, and therefore goes on to commit acts of violence against society to punish it and the people in it. \n\nEffectively, no amount of firearms restrictions, legislation, or bans will be effective at curbing this violence because it is intrinsic to capitalism. Take away guns? Knife attacks are next. Take away knives? Hammers, pieces of pipe, bombs, bows and arrows, etc. The violence will continue to perpetuate itself in a never-ending cycle until the cycle is finally broken by the fall of capitalism. That is the only answer that will truly solve the problem. Making people, all people, feel empathy and at home in their society is the only true answer.\n\nI am a gun owner. I am from Texas, and I went to school 100 miles from Santa Fe. My wife graduated from a high school less than 20 minutes away, and her two high school aged brothers were in class at the same school she went to. A lot of the survivors go to my in-law's church. Everyone there is in pain, and honestly, I'm afraid. I haven't yet been able to get a job and I'm probably going to end up substitute teaching in the SETX area this fall, and my wife is going for an alternative teaching certification this summer so at least one of us can get a job with health insurance. \n\nMy point is, I guess, that it's normal to feel helpless in these sorts of circumstances because we *are* helpless. Getting rid of guns won't solve the problem, as much as liberals want to give the state a monopoly on force, and I think at some level they know this. They're afraid, so they keep demanding it anyway, but no measure of control will end the attacks until capitalism is gone forever, and our society is changed from one of division into one of union, wherein all people are equal and workers have the power.\n\nAlso, one final comment re: fascist organizations recruiting young men and boys. You're 100% right about it. I've noticed unpleasant changes in my brothers-in-law, due to a \"friend\" who regularly posts Pepe the Frog memes, fascist trash, etc. While we currently live some six to eight hours away depending on the traffic, we're moving closer in two weeks. One of my goals is to play a bigger role in their lives so that the toxic masculinity they are being exposed to has a foil, and to help them question the BS they're being fed from everywhere. Sadly, school districts, as organs of the liberal state, have no interest in keeping fascism out of schools. In high school as a young communist, I was targeted by my administration, along with some friends, because we were seen as a radical element. Meanwhile, there were kids there who openly harassed black and brown students, and several of those children are now adults who are members of the local Klan.

But there was one major flaw that he couldn't account to, Marx's theory of the Infinite Accumulation of Wealth (Sorry if some terms are not accurately named, I read the book in Spanish and I'm translating the terms it says) was proven wrong by the economic consequences of the First Word War. Instead of having the 1% appropriating more and more wealth and power, thing that according to Marx would inevitably lead to the workers revolution, those territories full of income inequality went to war on each other, and that significantly decreased inequalities all around the board (If I remember correctly, the 1% went from owning 60% of the money to around 30-40%). In summary, he describes capitalism like some sort of Phoenix, that can rise up from a crisis it created because of its own flaws and better itself, like some sort of circle that it goes through. First there's a beta-like state of capitalism with flaws that inevitably creates a crisis and then a newer, better \"version\" of capitalism rises up from the ashes.\nEither way, I would really like to hear your opinions in all of this, it's a very interesting subject.

Communism is not strictly speaking a form of government, it is an economic system under which people are not exploited for profit or in which the abolishment of profit and wages is being worked towards. Communism is not incompatible with Democracy in any way, and the majority of communists that I know are fans of democracatic systems of one kind or another.\n\n2. I believe the economic and political policies enacted by both Vladimir Lenin and Iosef Stalin in the Soviet Union were extremely effective in transforming the former Russian Empire into a superpower able to compete with the Nazis and NATO, which sought to destroy them.\n\nThese policies were able to vastly and quickly increase the literacy of citizens, enormously increase production of many goods, and allow the Soviet Union to make great strides in science.\n\n3. Humans generally lack this ability, it is difficult not to abuse power, it is the goal of communism that no one person has power such as this over anyone, unlike in a capitalist society where by necessity employers must have power over employees.\n\n4. The reasons black markets form is because of a profit motive, it is the goal of communists to eliminate profit motive, so that these black markets too simply fade away, if there is nothing to be gained by profiting then why would one operate such a market? In cases where these markets deal in such things as sex trafficking, child pornography or similar illicit activities, then it is a much more serious issue.\n\n5.

{"author":"Pink_Leninade","body":"My closest experience was having lived with a host family in Berlin for a while. The mother had had family who lived somewhere in Saxony, and visited often from her youth on, as well as moving to West Berlin with the father before the wall came down. It never occurred to me to ask them if they were communists while I was there, but in retrospect I think they were. My impression of Berlin was mostly that people didn't want to feel cut off from their compatriots. Other than that, I saw an awful lot of at least tacit support for the DDR, if not outright communist sympathy\/support. In terms of other personal connections, I have a good friend from northern Ukraine and a handful of Chinese friends and acquaintances, all of whom are vocal communists, both at home and abroad. Drawing from this and my personally developed opinions, here are my answers: \n\n\n1. Communism is practical, but believing that we could jump from the state the world is in now to full Communism is the kind of idealism that seems to characterize anarchism. Communism is something that must be worked towards, deliberately and with great effort, before we could even begin to consider it extant. This being said, part of what defines communism is a stateless, classless society, so there wouldn't be a government (I don't mean to nitpick you, so much as to clarify). It can be achieved, but it isn't even on the horizon at this point.\n\n\n2. I believe that socialism has been built and that some socialist countries have built on top of that. I'd say that after Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev both worked (deliberately or by incompetence) to role back the socialism that had been built under Lenin and Stalin, and that China has faced similar problems with Deng and his ilk. Certainly, there have been ideal leaders and that socialist\/communist platforms have been pursued with great success, but that revisionists seem to have a way of worming their way into socialist governments. While I'd like to think that I have the answers to some questions, I can't claim in good faith that I have any actual idea of how to solve those problems. That is what books are for though, and I hope to further educate myself on such matters.\n\n\n3. I don't think humans are innately corrupt, or that power is an inherently corrupting force. When it comes to questions like this, I think a lot of the problem lies in the fact that when a government comes into power and events occur that they are expected to respond to, there is a tendency to either prioritize immediate benefits or to act in such a way that it is clear that the government has responded, even if the results aren't optimal. To me, this seems to force governments to abandon old positions and programs, to the point that it begins to pursue ideologically incongruous programs (as an example, consider the increasingly liberal foreign policies pursued by Khrushchev and Brezhnev where they claimed to not want to export revolution or support revolt, only to have them doing that very thing in Cuba, Vietnam, and Afghanistan). This is another problem that I don't know how to solve, but that I think must be a common effort of all socialists and communists.\n\n4. As to black-markets, I think anytime they spring up, the government must consider how the programs they pursue led them to be necessary, and do what the government can do to eliminate the usefulness of the markets or legitimize\/absorb them into the economy. I don't like the idea of a shadow economy, but the way to solve that problem isn't by punishing those who participate and hoping that they go away.\n\n\n5. I think that is a bit of a false dichotomy, but if I had to pick between say Canada or North Korea, I would pick North Korea. To my taste even imperfect socialism is a step up from capitalism. Granted I am a white man in the first world, buteel like a foreigner in my own country. I would prefer to feel like a foreigner in a society that I was helping to build than a patriot of a society that doesn't care if I live or die.\n","created_utc":1527347289,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

I actually did not understand at all what communism was in when I was studying the theories there because of the way it is taught- very rote memorization, no actual thought to the students. It seems like the powers that be kept everyone from questioning things. My mother went to 'vote' but she didn't even know who she was voting for. \n\nI don't like that. If communism were to be practical and possible then you must inform the citizens what it is, why it is good and have them think about it critically. Blind obedience isn't a good thing. \n\n&gt;Do you believe that it \"hasn't been done right before\"\/an ideal leader hasn't existed yet? \n\nI mean, the Soviet Union went from something like 3% literacy rate to 100%.

Unless you are talking about illegal drugs and certain \"subversive texts\", meaning things that criticize the government and such, I have always been able to buy what I want. We have problems with certain foods with poisonous chemicals showing up in the market, but that's due to a lack of regulation. \n\n&gt;Would you rather a country of people equally poor or a country like Canada where you can control your income?\n\n\nI was raised in the US and in Vietnam, and while when I was an angry teenager in Vietnam and really hated communism, as I grew older I find that the gap between the rich and the poor in Vietnam is not as insane as in countries like Canada and US. There is, also opportunity for someone from a really poor family to go to the best universities from middle school by their grades. From my personal experience, I've seen really good middle schoolers in the US but coming from a trouble background, and they get lost in the transfer between middle and high school. In Vietnam there is financial help offered to the poorest students from elementary to university, in every school. \n\nI wouldn't say it's \"equally poor\", but more like, will society help you off your feet?

Overtime IT moves into the private sector that competes in markets, and women drop-out. Also the nature of the field moves from scientific (computer as a physical model, programming instructions as electrical impulses flipping switches) to engineering(differentiation of virtual software and physical hardware, programming instructions as pure logic)  to artisanal (vocational training for coding, with the conceptual reduction to a vague computational substance) in tone.  In the \"scientific-stage\" it's people cooperating in a fight against nature, the engineering stage it's designs vs designs, in the artisanal stage it's a territorial fight. This coincides with an increase in conflict and women avoiding the field. In STEM education there is an increasing focus on career and a mode of competition that resembles that of professional football players, in the sense of who's brain has higher stats and can fetch the biggest payout, the sport analogy also remains intact in attempting doping, from micro-dosing nootropics and psyhchotropics, to abusing adhd and narcolepsy medication.

The next movie we watched had a female judge and several women in white collar jobs. That\u2019s just media I suppose but Russia was the first country to have women join the workforce in large numbers and there was no expectation that women would be worse at mental labor or math and science. There was a paper going around on here a while back about how women do the best in math on the former eastern bloc and the hypothesis was because it was only recently that there was any doubt about their abilities in STEM. Computing is more recent so I don\u2019t know as much about that, but there are a fair number of books and such about the USSR. The main issues I could see was that there was a gap in the number of women in politics (I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not worse than the one the US has now, let alone then) and that women still did most of the housework, although from the 30s-60s there were a lot of forms of socialized housework like all the women in an apartment building doing the dishes or laundry together and reducing the workload overall.

This new Reddit interface is strange!\n\n&gt;First and foremost thank you for the polite and in depth responses to my questions. \n\nYou're welcome.\n\n&gt;If you have anything I can read or even watch at that you believe to be somewhat fair and honest I'd love to check it out.\n\nWell, China is a big topic. You might need to be more specific before I could get you any recommendations.\n\n&gt;I'm definitely going to look into it myself but I fear that whatever I may find will be biased against China and at this point I actually want to broadened my perspectives.\n\nWell, it's not that hard to find pro-China stuff, or even material that isn't overtly biased against China. You might enjoy watching some of their English-language news, it's called CGTN (China Global Television Network). You might also like clicking on my profile and reading through my posting history, as well as other posts in the threads I participated in.\n\n&gt;I'm quite happy to hear you point about the importance of parties and not sole individuals, out of curiosity- do you believe that a \"council\" would be better than a single representative or figurehead?\n\nA council or a figurehead are ultimately just *symbolic*. There really are no such things as dictatorships. This is often frankly admitted in the academic literature, even for what most people consider right-wing dictatorships. I'd recommend reading the book *Hitler's Beneficiaries* to get an idea of just how massive the support for the Nazis was, and not only that, the material basis for that support.\n\nThe collapse of the USSR, for instance, seems to have more to do with Gorbachev's [Common European Home](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Common_European_Home) policy than anything else. Once the other Eastern Europeans understood what this meant, they dropped Marxism-Leninism like a sack of potatoes.\n\n&gt;Also, what's your perspective of having a few (let's say 1-3 parties) vs a large amount(let's say 3-9 parties)?\n\nMyself, I tend to think that multiple political parties are inherently unstable. Usually the other parties tend to just represent minority groups. They carve out niches in society and basically represent them and only them, which always comes with a threat of separatism. That would be the big threat of multiple political parties in China, and the case of Taiwan is most instructive in that regard (the DPP is basically a Hakka separatist group).\n\n&gt;I didn't expect someone to question the validity of my claims because I thought these claims were widespread and accepted -- I am not ashamed to admit that I find myself questioning my own narrative and moving forward ill definitely verify these claims for myself before proclaiming them.\n\nGreat!\n\nI can tell you, from the study I have done about the USSR in the past, that many things used to be believed about the USSR, until the archives opened up in the early 90s (and then were closed again very quickly). For instance, did you know it used to be common, even in the academic journals, to claim most of the USSR's economy functioned on penal labor, and that the country had a prison population of about 30 million people?\n\nYou can still find old videos on Youtube about this, complete with Soviet dissidents spreading this claim. It was completely false, but no academic who supported it ever had to apologize for it. The same academics who would claim the opening of the archives would vindicate them, then went on to claim you can't trust the archives at all. You still occasionally find people on the internet who will say this, people who haven't realized this claim has been completely debunked.\n\nSo I've learned to be very skeptical about *any* claims about former (and current!) communist countries. We all have our biases, of course, but it is important to be aware of them, and to be critical of them ourselves.\n\n&gt;Do you feel like you have the ability to express yourself\/thoughts\/beliefs\/opinions freely?\n\nYes. I've never once felt like I'm being censored or anything, whether on WeChat or in real life. But then again, I am a Marxist-Leninist that likes China, so why would they bother?\n\nBut more than that, I've never once got that impression even talking to dissidents here (and you do find them). Even the dissidents realize the internet censorship stuff has more to do with the government being anti-pornography than anything else.","created_utc":1527380376,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

(For example when my family had to get food, many times they would bribe the official in charge of food rations.\n\nThis black market came as a result of reforms after the Stalin era. I will now quote a Russian economist(Grigorii Khanin) who also lived in the USSR and was born way back in the 1930s, so he was able to experience most of the Soviet era. The source will be here: https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/3594504?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents \n\n&gt;After 1953 there was a sharp weakening of the state's supervisory functions in the\neconomy. The totally justified and timely reduction of the punitive function of the\nMVD in the political sphere was accompanied by a similar reduction, if not abolition,\nof that function in the economic sphere, where it had played a positive role by\nproviding the political leadership with objective information about the state of affairs\nin the economy. This reduction was entirely in the interests of the economic\nnomenklatura, a considerable part of which wanted a lack of supervision so they\ncould both paint a favourable picture of the situation and enrich themselves. At the\nsame time, there was a reduction in economic supervision by other control organs (the\nprocuracy, the ministry of state control and departmental control organs). In other\nwords, the control system which is absolutely essential for any centralised system, and\nespecially in the command economy, where control by the market is absent, was to\na significant degree dismantled in the 1950s. When the dangerous consequences of\nthis were partially recognised at the beginning of the 1960s and more careful checking\nof the activities of economic organisations and organs of power began, a very\nsignificant level of corruption and abuse was revealed. Around 12,000 leading\npersonnel, including 4,000(!) party workers, were brought to court then for these\nabuses.44 The weakening of control by the centre was named by Mancur Olson as the\nmajor reason for the steep decline in efficiency of the command economy after the\ndeath of Stalin: 'As soon as communist power began to be dispersed communism was\ndoomed to collapse.'\"\n\nHe is basically saying that when the power of the MVD was reduced, there was more corruption and a black market grew because the MVD was the main thing that was supposed to destroy the black market; however, they didn't have much power to do so. In addition, it should be noted that East Germany(which was a more developed socialist country) had very little black markets unlike the USSR.\n\n&gt;Lastly, do you believe that it is more \"moral\" or even preferable to have a nation of people equally poor (for the purposes of this discussion I'm using the former USSR as an example) rather than a nation with inequality where people have a direct ability to increase their income\/living situation (like Canada which I hope we can agree is less oppressive to minorities and women)\n\nNo, I do not believe in that. The purpose of socialism is not to make people equally poor in the first place. While it is well known and correct that the Soviet Union was backwards compared to the West when looking at living standards, it was drastically better from the living standards back in Tsarist Russia. It should be noted that the Russian Empire had the level of economic development comparable to most of the third world countries at the time, but under socialism, it was lifted from its third world status and living standards improved (however as mentioned above, it still had a long way to go before catching up to the USA). Compared to other countries that started at a similar economic development as the USSR in 1928, the USSR by 1960 was far ahead of those countries.\n\n","created_utc":1527386434,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"nice_try_western_spy","body":"so about a week ago, someone posted this same question on communism101, and i spent almost a hour and a half writing a response but by the time i finished the post was already removed. i saved what i wrote because the same question is asked every other day. might as well use it. i based what i wrote off the questions the original poster asked, but you should get a general idea regardless.\n\ni use to be a trot for quite some time, and now that i sit outside of all of that mess i do have much more of a perceptive on trotsky and trotskyism then i had before. trotsky and his ideology (if you even can call it that) fits a nice little comfortable spot in leftism: lenin is cool but stalin is evil. you have to understand that marxism and becoming a marxist is a very traumatic thing, you basically just throw everything your parents, teacher, peers have taught you into the garbage, pretty much everything you have been told in life is just thrown away. so many new comers to marxism (leftism) follow a general progression (im not saying that this is always the case but in general this is the progression we see). \n\n- center: most people start in the center, of course it depends on where you live, but in general most people are center liberals. \n\n- leftism: then usually, if this path is chosen, people start to drift leftwards. many things effect why a person chooses the left over the right but in our day and age with the new rise of the right a new rise in the left is soon to come. this is usually when a person develops the idea that some kind of power or group is controlling everything, its very primitive at this point but the general concept is there. \n\n- marxism: now due to the right always calling left liberals communists this usually pushes general leftists or left leaning liberals into marxism. finally at this point the concept of someone controlling society is explained through class and class conflict. \n\n(anarchism is sometimes chosen instead of marxism, but in this case we are presuming marxism is the ideology preferred) \n\n- trotskism: after being submerged in marxism new comers usually are exposed to the works of lenin quite bit, so then a positive image of lenin starts to form. this is not very difficult because lenin these days is not the main target of capitalist propaganda anymore, so its much easier to accept lenin. the harder part is accepting the soviet union as a positive thing, and this can be really difficult. like i said marxism is traumatic and its a process of throwing away the things you have been taught. usually at this point you come face to face with stalin, and for a lot of well meaning comrades stalin is a line they cannot cross. they cannot throw away that one last bit of comfort, so they sadly usually just crawl into the nook of trotskyism and dig in. \n\n- marxism leninism: then if things line up a person can see above trotskism, and finally discard that one last bit of capitalist propaganda and accept stalin, but this is very difficult it sure was for me but if you can take the final plunge then everything else is pretty easy. \n\nas you can see, you just do not become a marxist over night, its a process, and trotskism fits into little niche in the process and sadly a lot of good comrades never leave that comfortable little niche. it is important to understand this progression, and how people are introduced into marxism to then understand Trotskyism's position it and trotskism's allure. trotskyism's allure plain and simple is that it is comfortable, not because it is right or truely marxist but because it still allows someone to be a \"marxist\" and not cross that uncrossable final line; but this is not marxist thought, and this is not how a marxist should act. marxists should not hide behind something as flimsily as trotskyism, or any other concept, just to make themselves feel better. i mean you've already gotten this far, why stop here? \n\nnow after some context we can get into your questions: \n\n&gt;What did he do for the cause?\n\nstalin did not do much for theory, but he made massive strides in practice. stalin, through collectivization and industrialization, created one of the first socialist states in history only followed up by perhaps maoist china and china even took a lot from the  stalin era soviet union. private property was abolished and the capitalist market place was dismantled, stalin and the party did something no other had ever been able to do before and this is why stalin is so important. \n \n&gt; Stalin was a power hungry psychopath\n\nyeah, this one's a classic. stalin during his career [tried to step down from power](https:\/\/socialistmlmusings.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/23\/stalins-four-attempts-at-resignation\/) a total of four times, and each time the request was denied and voted down by the party. why in the world would a power hungry maniac do this even once? \n\n&gt;even though Trotsky was supposed to be his successor.\n\n[lenin or the party has never said this](https:\/\/mltheory.wordpress.com\/2015\/03\/12\/80\/), this idea of trotsky being the new leader is just something trotsky made up himself. this is something you have to understand and make clear of, trotsky writes his own history his own story while many many other comrades who were there say something very different. trotsky writes up his real usefulness and makes himself seem like \"he lead the revolution single handedly\" like trotsky was as great as lenin even greater perhaps. there are so many other first hand accounts of things that directly contradict trotsky's version of history, yet trotsky's version is up held, why? because it is useful for the capitalists, a bolshevik that was in the ussr that hates stalin, trotsky has provided the capitalists with a mountains of great propaganda for decades. \n\nwhat we can see from lenin's \"final testament\" is that he wanted stalin to be fired from one, just one, of his many many positions and replaced with someone identical is every manner expect less rude. this fixation on rudiness was probably spurred on by stalin yelling at krupskaya on the phone because she was providing lenin with party work which was requested he should not be doing by his doctors so lenin didn't have another stroke. \n ","created_utc":1527454908,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"nice_try_western_spy","body":"&gt;His concept of world revolution certainly was better than Stalin's socialism in one country.  \n\ntrotsky's permanent revolution was a borderline fanatic obsession for him, trotsky was willing to sacrifice everything just to fulfill it, most of the party including lenin thought he was crazy due to this. for example, during the civil war the bolsheviks were all waiting nervelessly for the inevitable worldwide revolutions which were inspired by their recent success, and they did happen. revolutions in Finland, Ukraine, Mongolia, etc, but the main goal was Germany a actually industrialized super power. if germany had a successful revolution then a massive amount of pressure would be taken off of the ussr and a great ally would be made, and for a time it seemed like revolution was very close but then the social democrats betrayed it and Luxembourg and company were executed. during this time lenin and even stalin hoped for this revolution in germany, but when it failed they understood they just had to go on without it. at the time the red army was tired and beaten down after years of war and the ussr really risked a lot already and if they did anymore then they might loose everything. then trotsky going on about his revolution suggested to push into germany, everyone thought he was insane because almost certainly if they did so the red army would loose and the ussr would be engulfed by the imperialists, but trotsky didn't care he just wanted his permanent revolution. all marxists, lenin, stalin, mao, etc want a international revolution, it is an inseparable part of marxism, but lenin\/stalin simply wanted to safe guard the revolution in their home country first instead of risking it all on insane gambles. after the ussr stabilized they sent aid\/help to foreign revolutions, the ussr greatly aided the leftists in spain during the spanish civil war, the ussr aided china during their revolution, and korea during theirs. so it is completely wrong to say stalin and the party never helped any other revolutions, because they clearly did. \n\n&gt;  Stalin had Trotsky killed\n\ni thank stalin everyday for throwing that icepick all the way from moscow to mexico and hitting trotsky in the head. \n\n&gt;(just like the Great Purges)\n\nthe great purges was probably one of the greatest examples of proletarian democracy up to that point, and this is its own thousand word post, so im am just going to link you to some good stuff. [this](http:\/\/stalinsociety.net\/?p=192) piece is long, but well cited and covers it all. then you have [FinBol's](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TBY_aDd5knE) little series on it, which is pretty much comprised of quotes and first hand accounts. \n\n&gt; but if Trotsky won the power struggle, communism would destroy fascism much more easily, and the Soviet Union would suffer much less\n\nto be completely honest if trotsky assumed power after lenin died then the ussr would have collapsed within a year or two \n\n&gt; during the purges Stalin killed lots of officers, leaving the Red Army with weak leadership,\n\nonly a small fraction were removed, not enough to effect the red army in any way, plus the ones removed were literal nazis so they were far better off. refer to the [post](http:\/\/stalinsociety.net\/?p=192) i already linked before. \n\n&gt; Also look at the Winter War where the massive Soviet army, with tanks and other technology had huge problems defeating the Finn\n\n[FinBol](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9_DQ3IhNH9o) also did something on this as well, and you know him being Finnish and all. \n\nreally what made me change my mind about stalin in the end was just learning more about him, before hand i was only taught about stalin by the capitalists and trotsky. i pretended like i had a full  understanding, like i thought i had a grasp on both sides of the story. of course i didn't, i was just being force fed trotsky's little fairy tales about the evil gremlin stalin instead of seriously learning about him. the book [Another View of Stalin](https:\/\/stalinsocietypk.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/05\/another-view-of-stalin1.pdf) is what finally tipped me over and made me see the errors of my ways. this book covers stalin's life, and is cited with first hand accounts, accounts from mainstream historians, and accounts from the soviet archives. this is really just a you problem, you are the only one who can change your own mind all we can do is make suggestions. if you approach all of this not wanted to see or learn anything, well guess what will happen. you have to read with an open mind you have to use marxist thought. here's another [reading list](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1qeYeYeLN7uKxfMdoe7TAmOMD2fmgyZdU_urvW6eAsRg\/edit) if you want more. \n\n","created_utc":1527454938,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"WikiTextBot","body":"**Monti Cabinet**\n\nThe Monti cabinet was the sixty-first cabinet of the government of Italy and was announced on 16 November 2011. This Experts' cabinet was composed of independents, three of whom were women and was formed as an interim government. The government ran the country for eighteen months until the aftermath of the elections in Spring 2013 and then replaced by the Letta Cabinet, formed by Enrico Letta on 28 April.\n\n***\n\n**Elsa Fornero**\n\nElsa Fornero (born 7 May 1948) is an Italian politician who served as Minister of Labor, Social Policies and Gender Equality in the Monti cabinet from November 2011 to April 2013.\n\n***\n\n**Italian constitutional referendum, 2016**\n\nA constitutional referendum was held in Italy on Sunday 4 December 2016. Voters were asked whether they approve a constitutional law that amends the Italian Constitution to reform the composition and powers of the Parliament of Italy, as well as the division of powers between the State, the regions, and administrative entities.\n\nThe bill, put forward by then- Prime Minister of Italy, Matteo Renzi, and his centre-left Democratic Party, was first introduced by the government in the Senate on 8 April 2014. After several amendments were made to the proposed law by both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, the bill received its first approval on 13 October 2015 (Senate) and 11 January 2016 (Chamber), and, eventually, its second and final approval on 20 January 2016 (Senate) and 12 April 2016 (Chamber).\n\n***\n\n**Lega Nord**\n\nLega Nord (LN; English: Northern League), whose complete name is Lega Nord per l'Indipendenza della Padania (Northern League for the Independence of Padania), is a regionalist political party in Italy. In the run-up of the 2018 general election, the party was rebranded as Lega (League) without changing its official name in the party's constitution. The party was nonetheless frequently referred to only as \"Lega\" even before the rebranding.

After Casaleggio's death in April 2016, Grillo appointed a Directorate composed of five leading MPs (Alessandro Di Battista, Luigi Di Maio, Roberto Fico, Carla Ruocco, Carlo Sibilia), which lasted until the following October, when Grillo dissolved it and proclaimed himself \"political head\". Grillo is also formally president of the association named \"Five Star Movement\", with his nephew Enrico Grillo vice president and his accountant Enrico Maria Nadasi secretary.\n\n***\n\n**Italian general election, 2018**\n\nThe 2018 Italian general election was held on 4 March 2018 after the Italian Parliament was dissolved by President Sergio Mattarella on 28 December 2017.\n\nVoters were electing the 630 members of the Chamber of Deputies and the 315 elective members of the Senate of the Republic for the 18th legislature of the Italian Republic since 1948. The election took place concurrently with the Lombard and Lazio regional elections.\n\nThe centre-right alliance, in which Matteo Salvini's League emerged as the main political force, won a plurality of seats in the Chamber of Deputies and in the Senate.\n\n***\n\n**Paolo Savona**\n\nPaolo Savona (born 6 October 1936, Cagliari) is an Italian economist and university professor.\n\n***\n\n**Giuseppe Conte**\n\nGiuseppe Conte (Italian pronunciation: [d\u0292u\u02c8z\u025bppe \u02c8konte]; born 8 August 1964) is an Italian jurist and politician. A professor of private law, he was proposed, in May 2018, for the role of Prime Minister at the head of a government formed between the Five Star Movement and League, however after few days he renounced to his post due to contrast about the choice of ministers.\n\n***\n\n**Matteo Salvini**\n\nMatteo Salvini (Italian pronunciation: [mat\u02c8t\u025b\u02d0o sal\u02c8vi\u02d0ni]; born 9 March 1973) is an Italian politician serving as Federal Secretary of Lega Nord since December 2013 and Us with Salvini since December 2014.

{"author":"ASocialistAbroad","body":"Too much idealism here and not enough materialism. The far right is experiencing a surge in popularity in every country in the first world imperialist core. It's likely the result of a lot of white workers who, due to living in wealthy countries, can be more easily convinced that they too can become rich as long as their countries don't lose their status and power in the world. In addition, revolution requires a certain level of unity among the workers, and race relations have stood in the way of revolution in the US since the Industrial Revolution.\n\nWhen Americans say they \"don't like Nazism\", they often don't even know what Nazism is, and it's common to equate Nazism with political violence or suppression of dissent. That's why so many people can say, with a straight face, that antifa are more like Nazis than actual Nazis. Americans hate the Nazi brand.

The proletarian struggle also has its trials, its defeats.

Generally, if what you hypothesize would be true about lack of tolerance for failure, internalizing it is much more common psychologically. A higher suicide rate is more likely than a higher homicide rate. Think Japan and South Korea, for example, two cultures where pressure to be successful is incredibly high, and homicide rate is much lower than suicide rate statistically by country. \n\nI do agree though. The gun problem is mostly social. Lack of trust in the police is doing a lot of damage as well, not saying it's undeserved mind you. It just doesn't help. All the \"arm the teacher\" nonsense as well just escalates things. People need to realize that whether a gun is used for \"good\" or \"evil\", somebody dies.

Romeo &amp; Juliet. You want a new one? 13 Reasons Why. It's a big part of our culture. I'll agree that the Japanese have a much longer, storied history with suicide, but they have a much longer history as a country so I don't know if that's as relevant. We romanticize death in general, but that's a fairly common thing in art, making death seem like bliss. \n\nI used to be on the left, I would probably say I was a classical liberal. There are a lot of reasons I'm this way now, but I think the straw that broke me was a debate in high school. Someone told me I was a white male, and that I had no right to say anything about feminism, I think because I \"knew nothing of being disenfranchised\"? Which, coming from someone far richer than me who had married parents and a better mental state than myself, just kind of opened my eyes, I'd say. However, I'm more against the current left culturally than economically. Being wrong on economics is much easier for me to imagine than being wrong on freedom. I just can't seem to separate the two. \n\nI've also read Drug War Capitalism by Dawn Paley, and I actually think it made me more capitalist than I was going in. The government doesn't do anything right as is, yet somehow we expect it to serve the people better than they can serve themselves.

{"author":"SissokoSalesman","body":"Communism is an ideology based upon the political science of Marxism. To understand how communists work and think, you must first understand Marxism. There's a a lot more to Marxism than what can be summed up in a few sentences but there's a few basic principles. The core principle of Marxism is class struggle, namely the class conflict between the workers and lower classes (proletariat) and the wealthy land and business owners (bourgeoisie). The problem with our current society is that because the wealthy upper classes have so much more influence and power than the workers, it ends up meaning that society benefits them first with everyone else being disadvantaged. However, if it becomes too blatant then they run the risk of a revolution occurring, so they use certain institutions to prevent the lower classes from becoming class-conscious.\n\nFor example, they can lobby the government to give them tax breaks and reduce union power and also give them the benefit of state protection via the police and military if a violent uprising was to occur. The bourgeoisie also have control over the news, so they can influence people to vote the way that they want and can also use opinions and news stories to keep the working class divided. Religion can also help keep people distracted from what's really going on in the world, and also teaches people to accept their place in return for a place in the afterlife. Capitalism provides us with a distraction too, we work to buy stuff so we can stay alive in order to work more to buy more stuff ect. This might sound utterly deluded or whatever, but that's to be expected. Pretty much our entire lives we've been brought up to believe in capitalism, and not challenge the injustices that we see around us everyday.\n\nSo what's the solution? First of all, the working class must become class conscious and then they must put their differences aside to work together to take on the bourgeoise society. A revolution of some form must then occur and some form of government that represents the working people will be installed. The bourgeoisie will be removed from their positions of influence and private ownership will changes hands from the individuals to the people. This new system is true Socialism as now the means of production are publicly owned.\n\nCommunism is what communists believe the end result of socialism will be. This new society will no longer have class struggle between the proletariat and bourgeoisie. The society will no longer be threatened by outside influences as communism is a globalist ideology. This will mean the erosion of borders and state as the people will be able to control their own destinies and create their own laws to abide by. This is pretty much the end goal of communism, to create this utopia where everyone works together to innovate and live freely.\n\nNow this is quite a brief explanation and is my interpretation of what communism is to me. There's a lot of different interpretations and ideas on how communism is to be achieved and what the end result should look like. If you're interested in learning more then there's a lot of literature out there that should answer your questions. Otherwise if there's anything I'd say is most important to learn, it's to look at different issues you might see in life from the perspective of class struggle. Look at who benefits and who loses out from each situation. Once you get that, you'll get what communism is all about. ","created_utc":1527704876,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

Notwithstanding the actions of some violent and highly ideologised individuals, the movement itself doesn\u2019t actually threaten the state in any meaningful way.\n\nThe pseudo-libertarian rhetoric of some American fascists can be confusing on this point. Fascists often use certain kinds of public rhetoric to gain a following which doesn\u2019t really have much to do with their actual agendas. The Nazis loved to attack \u201cmonopoly capitalists\u201d in their public rhetoric but when they got into power, it was the \u201canti-capitalist\u201d wing of the party  (that\u2019s being a bit too generous towards the Strasserists, but I don\u2019t know what else to call it) that was purged. \n\nSimilarly, I don\u2019t think you should take the anti-statist professions of American fascists at face value.

{"author":"rahewin","body":"I would suggest trying to think about these things as constantly needing to be reproduced, if that makes sense. It\u2019s not that American society _was_ founded on the super-exploitation of indigenous, black, and later other immigrant peoples. It\u2019s that American society requires the constant super-exploitation of these groups _right now_, and a lot of the cultural production that happens in America is devoted to mystifying things, so that the people who are being exploited don\u2019t fully realise they are being exploited, and the people who are exploiting them don\u2019t fully realise they are exploiting them.\n\nLike I said, this doesn\u2019t happen at one point in history, it is constantly happening. This state of affairs requires constant re-production. The super-exploitation must keep happening. The mystification must keep happening. Alongside the mystification of the real social relations, alternative narratives have to be produced to justify the obvious inequality and brutality of the current society. \n\nThe two dominant narratives in American cultural life are (1) the liberal narrative of social progress: things were bad in the past, but it\u2019s getting better, we just have to wait and be nice and let the old racist people die off and (2) the conservative narrative of personal responsibility: whites work hard and live better lives and therefore are better off, everyone else is varying degrees of unworthy and therefore don\u2019t. If you subscribe to the second narrative then, of course, you require a racial scapegoat to explain why it seems like in the past forty years whites are suddenly not doing so well. \n\nSo in summation I\u2019d just say that the extraction of surplus from the super-exploited peoples is not a justification in itself. A lot of the ideological superstructure of US society is dedicated to pretending that there IS no such thing as exploitation. It\u2019s because of that superstructure that the racial scapegoat thing is necessary. Hope that makes some sense.","created_utc":1527727984,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

Molotov appears to support the view expressed in the Stalin Society paper - that Stalin supported the formation of a Palestinian state in which Jews and Arabs shared power.\n\n&gt;We argue instead, that the only logical answer is two-fold:\nFirstly, the USSR, was not under Stalin\u2019s full un-impeded control. Even following the victory of the Great People\u2019s Anti-Fascist War, revisionist influence within the CPSU and in the leading echelons of the so called People\u2019s Democracies undermined Marxist-Leninist policies; Stalin and the Marxist-Leninists, were in a minority in the Central Committee of the CPSU(B).\nSecondly, that post Second World War, Stalin and the USSR were in a position of a temporary objective weakness with respect to the foreign imperialism of the USA. Although epitomised by the \u201cAtomic Gap\u201d, closing that gap still left the USSR in an objectively weaker position than the USA.\n\n\n\n\n","created_utc":1527786669,"score":13,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"ahorsenamedwhimsical","body":"I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s something you\u2019ve had to experience first hand! It\u2019s really unfortunate. To begin with, we have police who aren\u2019t trained in psychology or social work being the first responders in a lot of these cases, which has the propensity to escalate violence because the police are basically just a paramilitary organization designed to enforce inequity through brutality. They don\u2019t have the skills or intelligence to deal with someone having a crisis. Lucky for them, attempting suicide is still a \u2018crime\u2019 in most places too, so they feel somewhat justified in using misplaced force. Then you have the system at large, which is pretty much designed to do the bare minimum and reduce financial burden on the state, so naturally, that blows. To top it off, I\u2019d argue that an issue like a rise in suicide rates is directly associated to the resentment people associate with capitalist society (it\u2019s hard to be happy when you are obligated to comply with an oppressive economic system), and of course the state is never going to try and help people by illustrating the sources of their woes might be a thing the state is committed to perpetuating, so rather than point to material conditions, we\u2019ve adopted this highly personalized view of mental illness and suicide where people get blamed for having a unavoidable medical problem.","created_utc":1527796112,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"hopefullydeadsoon126","body":"I have always thought a lot and asked a lot of questions since I was young, however this honestly took its toll. I never believed in Santa, I never genuinely believed in God, I have always been searching for philosophical answers and \"meaning\" \\(For lack of a better term\\). This hurt me a lot, I could never relate to my friends, I would always get into deep conversations with unwilling participants \\(this is actually pretty funny but still unfavorable\\), I had never succumb to wishful thinking \\(with the exception of a psychotic experience\\), and I always had empathy for other life forms \\(albeit sometimes it had underlied\\).\n\nI would constantly get depressed that a lion is literally going to eat a zebra today and there's nothing I can do about it, and other terrible things about life that are inherent. I listened to Schopenhauer audio\\-books regularly and just generally abided by existential nihilism.\n\nI tell you all of this to get to this point, no one can understand it. I was a bit triggered when you said\n\n&gt; who aren\u2019t trained in psychology or social work \n\nBut this is a bit of a dangerous thought, because this implies that those who *are* trained in psychology and social work are always competent. Now, I have witnessed them help a lot of people, but those people generally just had some kind of neurochemical lapse in their mind which they couldn't explain, or they had a bad trip on a drug, they got some meds, and then they were better. I'm a complete anomaly. I have been receiving intensive psychiatric treatment for 4 years and absolutely nothing has helped *except* philosophy, and that's a double edged sword, like a racket, because philosophy is what caused my depression in the first place, and it is only when I genuinely feel like there is something with positive potential in the world \\(or something that is currently good in the world\\) that makes me feel like I have something to fight for.\n\nHowever sometimes I get suicidal because I just think \"do I really want to fight? Do I really want to spend time feeling uncomfortable when I can just die instead? Why do anything when I could be peacefully resting underground?\"\n\nPsychologists are really loose, they'll say something like \"whatever makes you happy as long as you aren't hurting yourself or others\" and this is pretty bad, because someone can say something like \"I have converted to a new religion and it makes me happy,\" and they'd be considered cured. Next thing you know their new religion was actually Charles Manson's cult and in the long run they killed tons of people for cult\\-reasons. Then the psychologist would say something like \"Well he was doing a lot better the last time I met with him!\"\n\nAlso there's a heavy anti\\-suicide perspective in the psychiatry community, it doesn't matter how reasonable a suicidal person is. If they express suicidal thoughts then they are automatically labeled 'delusional' and 'incapable of rational thinking,' now this might seem like it's not a big deal if some random guy on the street do it, but instead you have holier than thou psychiatrists and psychologists that have legal authority to detain you for as long as necessary, legal authority to strip you of clothing for \"your own safety,\" legal authority to watch you 24\/7 \\(This is called 'suicide watch,' they can watch you shower, use the bathroom, etc\\). It's honestly criminal and it's kidnapping. However they have come to their senses recently, only a little bit, and legalized assisted suicide for termanilly ill people, but this is still bad because it only proves that suicide is not universally negative. What about people living with bipolar disorder or have chronic treatment\\-resistant depression? If nothing has gotten better in 10 years, why keep telling them that \"it will get better, it always does!\"\n\nAlso one thing is that while they can only detain you if you are a danger to yourself or others, they can *keep* you detained for any reason. I remember once I was scheduled to be discharged from the hospital, and then I told the psychiatrist I wanted to get a \\(temporary\\) tattoo of a barcode, she cancelled my discharge and I was held there for even longer.\n\nAnyway I can go on and on about what's wrong with the psychiatric and mental health system. But my point is that being 'trained' only helps a little bit.\n\nOne thing to add, if a person attempts suicide, and throughout everything the person is polite, then they will most\\-likely be treated fine.\n\nHowever if a person attempts suicide, and throughout everything the person is rude, then it is likely that they will be abused by mental health officials and officers \\(as seen in this article\\).\n\nThe atrocities go on and on and on. The field of psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience and so on and so forth are VERY undeveloped. I feel that in the conclusion of all studies in these fields it should read \"inconclusive\" because there's just so much we don't know, and these studies are being used to justify horrible things \\(see: race realism\\).\n\nSpeaking of race realism, I'm black. You can probably guess how that affects my depression. Black people are actually more likely to be mentally ill due to racist oppression.\n\nOne last thing \\(I promise this is final\\), I am very skeptical of the data that comes out of psychology in regards to mental health, like I remember once I smoked weed, then the next day I attempted suicide by cop, on some statistic it would probably be written that weed raises the probability of people attempting suicide, however there have been times which I attempted suicide after not smoking for over a year, as well as smoking for a long time and not attempting suicide. So just as an example such a statistic would be misleading. A lot of psychologists \\(see Jordan Peterson\\) seem to believe that psychology is like physics and it is not any more subject to pseudoscience than psychics is. Psychology seems to be a place where some pseudo\\-scientists can have a field day peddling misleading garbage, while actual genuine psychologists who remain skeptical in every part of the scientific process are thrown to the side because their conclusions aren't as interesting or does not provide as much shock\\-value as the pseudoscientists. The most famous psychologist most people can think off of the top of their head is Jordan Peterson... This is blasphemy!\n\nEdit: Another reason why appealing to the authority of a trained psychologist or social worker or psychiatrist is dangerous is because generally in a courthouse, the testimony of said trained professional is almost always taken over the defendant. Now I'm not talking about crimes against other people but if a suicidal person wants to leave a hospital and the psychiatrist won't let him, they have to go to court, and the judge will almost always take the psychiatrists side.","created_utc":1527798632,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}
