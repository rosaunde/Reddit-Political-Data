The US just came out of a great depression thanks to a war economy, Europe was destroyed, and the USSR was seen as 'the winner' in a sense of the post-War situation. Initial plans by the west to de-industrialize Germany (such as the Morgenthau Plan) were scrapped in order to have a bulwark against the USSR.

More importantly, it distinguishes literal occupation as only one expression of a more insidious and systematic international model of capitalism- to which the Nordic Model is guilty of. \n\nCommodities have steadily declined in prices since the '40s. All developing nations are compelled to engage in a 'Race to the Bottom' in the desperate contest for base sustenance. As Dependency theory articulates, without a manufacturing and sevice industry a nation is incapable of escaping this dynamic. \n\nEnter international 'investment' and loans. Poor nations are compelled to 'free' their markets which is another way of saying to have a fair race with no legs against a fellow in a car. They are compelled to decrease their government and refuse all nationalization, ostensibly in the name of freedom but really so as to destabalize any coherent strategies or development. Even the manufacturing that is created with the loans typically are awarded to international entities with no-bid contracts. Land is sold and the citizens of the nation displaced by the 'development' and forced to sell their harvesting bodies in manufactured conditions of deprivation. Fuck, read up on Export Processing Zones and appreciate how total the foreign capitalist control of the of these 'nations' truly are.\n\nThis all however is just another face of the core/satellite dichotomy. Any and all core nations, regardless of whether or not they send troops, engages very much in fatal and monsterous imperialism to enjoy those benifits. So long as they  'trade' with these nations or 'loan' them under condition, they are acting in every way the same as a capitalist does when he 'offers you a fair wage' while keeping as much of the surplus value as he can for himself and his class allies.\n\nI apologise for the overuse of quotes but I feel it appropriate and necessary to emphasize how dishonest these terms are when discussing the idea of social democracy as 'socialism'.","created_utc":1512136495,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

The civil war has been going on for more than 48 years and the revolutionary forces have been advancing pretty well. ","created_utc":1512223718,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

That is the true meaning of Lenin's claim that imperialism was the \"highest stage\" of capitalism: not that capitalism had reached the end of its lifespan or technical innovations but that capitalism could no longer develop new capitalist nations and only socialism was the path forward for the development of humankind to communism. Sure enough, the group of imperialists has remained unchanged since Lenin's time, even with the attempts at socialist development in the third world.

{"author":"PeoplesRevolution","body":"This is what Mao wrote about New Democracy. How does this not apply to Nepal? The situation is very similiar\n\n\"Since Chinese society is colonial, semi-colonial and semi-feudal, since the principal enemies of the Chinese revolution are imperialism and feudalism, since the tasks of the revolution are to overthrow these two enemies by means of a national and democratic revolution in which the bourgeoisie sometimes takes part, and since the edge of the revolution is directed against imperialism and feudalism and not against capitalism and capitalist private property in general even if the big bourgeoisie betrays the revolution and becomes its enemy \u2014 since all this is true, the character of the Chinese revolution at the present stage is not proletarian-socialist but bourgeois-democratic.\n\nHowever, in present-day China the bourgeois-democratic revolution is no longer of the old general type, which is now obsolete, but one of a new special type. We call this type the new-democratic revolution and it is developing in all other colonial and semi-colonial countries as well as in China. The new-democratic revolution is part of the world proletarian-socialist revolution, for it resolutely opposes imperialism, i.e., international capitalism. Politically, it strives for the joint dictatorship of the revolutionary classes over the imperialists, traitors and reactionaries, and opposes the transformation of Chinese society into a society under bourgeois dictatorship. Economically, it aims at the nationalization of all the big enterprises and capital of the imperialists, traitors and reactionaries, and the distribution among the peasants of the land held by the landlords, while preserving private capitalist enterprise in general and not eliminating the rich-peasant economy. Thus, the new type of democratic revolution clears the way for capitalism on the one hand and creates the prerequisites for socialism on the other. The present stage of the Chinese revolution is a stage of transition between the abolition of the colonial, semi-colonial and semi-feudal society and the establishment of a socialist society, i.e., it is a process of new-democratic revolution. This process, begun only after the First World War and the Russian October Revolution, started in China with the May 4th Movement of 1919. A new-democratic revolution is an anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolution of the broad masses of the people under the leadership of the proletariat. Chinese society can advance to socialism only through such a revolution; there is no other way.\n\nThe new-democratic revolution is vastly different from the democratic revolutions of Europe and America in that it results not in a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie but in a dictatorship of the united front of all the revolutionary classes under the leadership of the proletariat. In the present War of Resistance, the anti-Japanese democratic political power established in the base areas which are under the leadership of the Communist Party is the political power of the Anti-Japanese National United Front; this is neither a bourgeois nor a proletarian one-class dictatorship, but a joint dictatorship of the revolutionary classes under the leadership of the proletariat. All who stand for resistance to Japan and for democracy are entitled to share in this political power, regardless of their party affiliation.\n\nThe new-democratic revolution also differs from a socialist revolution in that it overthrows the rule of the imperialists, traitors and reactionaries in China but does not destroy any section of capitalism which is capable of contributing to the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal struggle.\" -Mao Zedong. \n","created_utc":1512418625,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

All these are specific tasks of the class struggle, tasks which the proletariat formerly did not and could not have set itself.\n\nThe NEP and New Democracy are the same: a temporary alliance with the progressive classes under the dictatorship of the proletariat so that industrial capitalism can grow against petty-production and the peasantry can overthrow the conditions of tenant exploitation as to develop to the point where agriculture can be collectivized. Mao makes it very clear that New Democracy only characterizes those areas under communist control:\n\n&gt;In present-day China, the anti-Japanese united front represents the new-democratic form of state. It is anti-Japanese and anti-imperialist; it is also a united front, an alliance of several revolutionary classes.

Although I understand it is a *highly* specific world outlook it seems to me to be, if not co-substantial, analogous to more idealistic conceptions. I would offer [dialectical monism]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_monism) as an example. I say it's analogous because Diamat is **rigidly** materialistic and non-dualistic, as such it becomes hard to even imagine such a form of unity for the bourgeois mind, raised in the Cartesian philosophical tradition. The section on Sartre in the article i linked is demonstrative of what i'm hinting at. \n\n&gt;  \"It is dualist because it is monist [?]. Marx\u2019s ontological monism consisted in affirming the irreducibility of Being to thought, and, at the same time, in reintegrating thoughts with the real as a particular form of human activity.\" \u2014Jean-Paul Sartre, Critique of Dialectical Reason, Vol. 1. Theory of Practical Ensembles\n\nIf i wanted to try and critique this from a diamat perspective I would say flatly that there is no dualism. Thoughts only appear empirically immaterial. In fact they are the result of material processes. As such being is obviously irreducible to thought as the prior statement rejects idealism. To even assert the immateriality of thoughts is the vulgarest form of dualism.\n\nOne thing also, if I can return from my tangent, that I find interesting from the standpoint of the Eastern origins of DiaMat is the similarity of my interpretations [stress the lumpen-proletarian/ petty-bourgeois class character of these interpretations] of Buddhism and Hegelian Absolute Idealism. For instance here is a wiki quote on absolute idealism:\n\n&gt;For Hegel, the interaction of opposites generates in dialectical fashion all concepts we use in order to understand the world. Moreover, this development occurs not only in the individual mind, but also through history...At the base of spirit [geist is mind *or* spirit] lies a rational development. This means that the absolute itself is exactly that rational development. The assertion that \"All reality is spirit\" means that all of reality rationally orders itself and while doing so creates the oppositions we find in it. Even nature is not different from the spirit since it itself is ordered by the determinations given to us by spirit. Nature, as that which is not spirit is so determined by spirit, therefore it follows that nature is not absolutely other, but understood as other and therefore not essentially alien.\n\nThis essentially, to me, is reminiscent of the way Buddhism deals with the origin of Samara. The key and most interesting difference is where Hegel finds rational development the Buddhist see such rational development as a disguise for ignorance. As such the ignorance of the mind that discriminates [leans one way or the other], vacillating from one extreme to the other, gives rise to the entire samsaric realm. They call this the [twelve fold chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Nid\u0101nas#The_Twelve-fold_Chain). When combined with an understanding of the concept of emptiness in Buddhism I, at least, see some pretty interesting comparisons. \n\nThat said, we know that DiaMat is almost literally the inversion of Absolute Idealism. So the extent you wanna regard it as part of the origins of DiaMat is up to you. \n\nSo who wants to read Materialism and Empiriocriticism? \n","created_utc":1512451617,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

For centuries we have heard that, e.g., \"human nature is heterosexual,\" that it's \"human nature for women to be more submissive or tend to the home,\" that it's \"human nature for blacks to be more primitive and violent,\" and every time it's proved false, none of those things are true. Human nature is a lazy excuse used by those who have neither logic nor evidence to prove what they're saying is true so they just engage in the \"appeal to common belief\" fallacy. Greed is the best example of this. Just because our social structure encourages and formulates greed in social subjects doesn't mean human nature is greedy. A different social structure that is more cooperative and takes care of people's needs would eliminate greed. If there's one thing history reveals about human beings, it's their elasticity, there plasticity, their changeability. There is clearly no such thing as human nature but don't you realize how radically good that is? People can be literally whatever they want under the right (non-oppressive, non-constraining, non-authoritarian) social structure. Communism's end goal is the all but absolute freedom of each individual and each collective: the freedom to only do the work you're interested in, the freedom to express yourself as you wish, the freedom from work, the state, oppression, and so on.

{"author":"lovelybone93","body":"Has Eurocentrism been a problem in communist spaces? Yeah. Did Marxism had eurocentric overtones? Yes. However, Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Hoxha, Mao, many other periphery communists and communist movements have commented and improved the communist movement's regards to colonialism, oppressed peoples and decolonization over each iteration of the communist movement. As far back as Marx and Engels, they noted a bourgeoisification and chauvinism of the proletariat in the core due to imperialism's sops, although this trend was in its infancy before they died. Lenin, Stalin, Bukharin, the Comintern also had to develop this line. So did Hoxha and Mao. As for the communist movement in the imperial core being largely chauvinistic, this is no surprise, as liberal, reactionary and chauvinist ideas are interpellated through all of us in capitalist society which not even communists are free of being stamped with the old society's birthmarks which we must consciously combat and rid ourselves and the movement of at every turn. \n\nThere are vulgar third worldists who say there is no proletariat in the core countries and the core countries have no revolutionary potential at all. This is untrue. There are bourgeois and proletarians in each country. However, the distinctions between classes are sharply pronounced in the periphery and semi periphery, as the value transfer is extracted from these countries to smooth over the imperial core's class contradictions between working-class and bourgeois. In the core imperialist countries, there is revolutionary potential among proletarians of oppressed internal colonies and nations besides a portion of the working-class of that nation and surplus proletariat or lumpens. However, this doesn't constitute the majority or even a significant plurality of it. Class often garbs itself in the clothing of race and sex. This means that revolution isn't likely to come from the imperial core, but most likely the periphery and semi periphery to throw the yoke of colonization and neo colonization off while attempting to change the production relations to one that has communist content. This doesn't mean that countries in the imperial core can sit with their thumbs up their ass, but it is the duty of communists in the imperial core to frustrate the colonial and neocolonial attempts of their countries as well as to organize the proletarians and surplus proletarians (or lumpen) as much as possible for the overthrow of imperialism, capitalism and the support of proletarian dictatorships.\n\nDecolonization is an important part of the communist movement. It will involve indigenous peoples the right of return and to administrate not just their prisonhouse reservations, but the land which was taken by settler-colonialism alongside peoples who are there with reparations from the white community.

{"author":"Zhang_Chunqiao","body":"In the age of imperialism, literally every nation has comprador bourgeoisie, *every* nation. By the very nature of being comprador bourgeoisie, they are anticommunist, and in practice, are further fed anticommunism by the imperial propaganda organs in universities, the press, etc. So that's where most of this stuff is coming from.\n\nAs for the content of this thread that would make his CSIS handler proud, its just the same tired anticommunist tropes and national exceptionalism that every comprador bourgeois spouts. The immediate dismissal of the most obvious counter-examples to the garbage notion that communism is somehow inherently 'white', settler-colonialist or 'eurocentric' is brazenly dishonest.\n\n&gt;the principal source of oppression remains genocide and the loss of our land. Thus, our struggle principally revolves around ending genocide and returning land to our Nations. \n\nin other words the aims of pretty much every marxist-leninist party in the global south. \n\n&gt;settler colonialism, which is more than just \"colonialism plus settlers\" is outside of the Leninist theorization of imperialism. This is why I say \"Marxism\" is eurocentric.\n\nLenin didn't mention a specific phenomenon in the american continent ergo its wrong and inapplicable to it...? He didn't mention settler-colonialism in Vietnam or Palestine yet the communists there managed to apply the science of marxism-leninism just the same. Oh right they don't count because its not kanada. \n\n\n&gt;These are questions and demands that are not answered in any kind of detailed way by the programmes\n\nIncredibly dishonest. Most anti-revisionist orgs make explicitly clear that they are opposed to the ongoing genocide of first nations and support their independent self-determination in their platforms. Without a section of an org/party within a given nation, its literally impossible to have a more specific platform, so if they had one anyway, it would be denounced (rightfully so).\n\n&gt;1) the return the land, all of it, and not just symbolically to Native nations;...\n\nland collectivization in other words with the expulsion of foreign landlords like in vietnam, china, korea, etc. \n\n&gt;2) the abolition of antiblackness and worldwide African liberation; 3) dismantle the imperial metropole and its parasitic relationship with the Global South.\n\n\n...again that's just marxism-leninism.\n\n\nI'll add that the two individuals tagged in the beginning of the thread are noted anticommunists, with William Richardson being known to spout lies that would make even Anne Applebaum blush. Disregard completely.\n\n\n","created_utc":1512518449,"score":17,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"CheffeBigNoNo","body":"It's a very serious sin of omission, and while not an open endorsement of the party's counterrevolutionary role, it certainly seems weird to criticize the war, but not drowning several revolutions in blood and essentially paving the way for Nazism.\n\nBut the real issue here is the thing the Jacobin article is arguing **for**. It talks up this alternate social sphere, without realizing that it can only be built by the sort of party prewar Social-Democracy built - a broad party open to all layers of the class. Lenin analyzed this as the major fault with prewar socialist organizing, and thus came to the conclusion that the vanguard party format, forced on the Russian SD by circumstances, was a necessity for building revolutionary organizations everywhere.\n\nSo essentially, Jacobin criticizes the party's support for the war, but encourages the organizing method that led to it. As a tweet mocking the \"social liberal, fiscal conservative\" approach says: the problems are terrible, but the causes... the causes are very good.\n\n(EDIT: It is, of course, typical for petty reformist bureaucrats to praise organization without caring for political reprecussions. \"The movement is everything, the final goal is nothing\", right?)","created_utc":1512593701,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"butlercq","body":"Religion is not the primary tool in the US to oppress the working class. If anything, religion is liberating; Christianity teaches that the only master we should follow is God and his will. It is true that some churches teach parts of God's will as hating gays, or keeping women in the kitchen, but the _primary_ will of God in every Christian church is to love your neighbor as yourself. I'm confused how anyone can say that is anti-socialist.\n\n\nI'm not saying religion can't be oppressive -- it can be. However, religion is not inherently oppressive and is not the primary tool for oppression in the United States. The primary tool for oppression in the US is simply capitalist propaganda: the idea that anyone can succeed, and that the ones that don't simply didn't win the markets over, or didn't try hard enough. This ideology comes from the privilege of the middle to higher class and prevents the lower classes -- the ones with little political power -- from having any large amount of economic freedoms.\n\n\nThe reason why many communists hate the neo-atheist movement occuring in America is because the leaders of such movement -- Bill Maher, Richard Dawkins, even Bill Nye, and an incredible amount of Atheist internet personalities -- are growing increasingly islamophobic. They blame terrorist groups like ISIS on Islam and it's faults, rather than discuss the actual problems in those third-world communities. However, not all atheist Americans are a part of the neo-atheist movement, and so I feel like some of your commenters could have misjudged you and your political beliefs.","created_utc":1512593890,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, and I am indeed from Puerto Rican descent, where generations upon generations of my family rooted. And there, there was no such thing as racism. We ourselves are a kind of people who cannot discriminate, because it would discriminate ourselves as well. We all have black, native (ta\u00edno) and white (Spanish) blood in our veins. Most people in Latin America do, and I have known many peoples from these countries and this isn't at all a rampart problem.\n\nAs a Brazilian, I have to say that yours is a very romantic, and very wrong, view that many people here also espouse. I don't think a society can get more miscigenated than ours, and yet our black people suffer from a disproportionately high incarceration rate. Over half of our population is black, yet don't correspond to even a quarter of our university students. In the state of Rio de Janeiro, they are 11% of the population and yet correspond to over a third of the population killed by the police. Nation-wide, you are more than twice as likely to get murdered if you are black than if you are white. Of our 513 congressmen, only 40 are black - 10%, in a country where half the population is of their ethnicity, a ratio that is even more discrepant when you start looking at employment rates and wages.\n\nRacism in Latin America is real. I'll concede that it might not be as pronounced and \"ugly\" as in the USA, if only because open racism is *very* poorly viewed here (at least in Brazil, I imagine it might be more \"accepted\" in whiter countries such as Chile and Argentina), but it still happens on every level - individual and institutional. A miscigenated person is *very* capable of seeing herself as whiter than someone who is entirely black or blacker than her, and then be a racist based on that interpretation (of her being whiter than other miscigenated or outright black people).","created_utc":1512698541,"score":11,"subreddit":"communism"}

Institutional racism is a very well-known and well-documented fact here (since you're Puerto-Rican, I imagine you speak Spanish: just google 'racismo no brasil' or take a look on (what [wikipedia says on the topic](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racismo_no_Brasil), it's in Portuguese but you'll get the gist of it).\n\nAnecdotally, it's having friends who won't pull the hood up on their hoodie during colder nights because that's an excuse for police to stop them; who won't go out if they can't find their document because if you're black and don't have a document with you (which isn't illegal), you're evidently a criminal (/s) and shall be arrested; it's studying in a university and seeing that out of the sixty people who joined my class that year, three were black (5% of the class, as opposed to over 50% of the population being black); it's hearing white people make off-handed jokes or expressions about black people and their heritage and justify it just as 'humor'.\n\nAgain, I'm not saying we're *worst* than the USA - that's a hard milestone to beat, though I wouldn't be surprised if we did - I'm saying that the whole miscigenated racial peace is more of a myth than a reality.

He even acknowledges himself that his political views have nothing to do with in-depth political or economic theory but are purely a matter of applying good plain old common sense dangnabbit, and he dismisses the entire concept of social scientific theory in vulgar STEM-fetishist terms that wouldn't sound too surprising coming from an anti-\"SJW\" \"New Atheist\" type reactionary.

{"author":"ArbysMakesFries","body":"One of my favorite passages of Marx is [a short aside in the introduction to the Grundrisse](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch01.htm) where he drops his pants and takes a massive, hundred-years-preemptive shit all over the basic tenets of Chomskian linguistics:\n\n&gt; The human being is in the most literal sense a \u03b6\u1ff6\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03c7\u03cc\u03bd [political animal], not merely a gregarious animal, but an animal which can individuate itself only in the midst of society. Production by an isolated individual outside society \u2013 a rare exception which may well occur when a civilized person in whom the social forces are already dynamically present is cast by accident into the wilderness \u2013 is as much of an absurdity as is the development of language without individuals living *together* and talking to each other. There is no point in dwelling on this any longer. The point could go entirely unmentioned if this twaddle, which had sense and reason for the eighteenth-century characters, had not been earnestly pulled back into the centre of the most modern economics by Bastiat, Carey, Proudhon etc. Of course it is a convenience for Proudhon et al. to be able to give a historico-philosophic account of the source of an economic relation, of whose historic origins he is ignorant, by inventing the myth that Adam or Prometheus stumbled on the idea ready-made, and then it was adopted, etc. Nothing is more dry and boring than the fantasies of a locus communis.\n\nCompare to this, written by Chomsky in 2005:\n\n&gt; Putting these thoughts together, we can suggest what seems to be the simplest speculation about the evolution of language. Within some small group from which we are all descended, a rewiring of the brain took place in some individual, call him *Prometheus*, yielding the operation of unbounded Merge, applying to concepts with intricate (and little understood) properties. Guided very likely by third factor principles, Prometheus\u2019s language provides him with an infinite array of structured expressions with interpretations of the kind illustrated: duality of semantics, operator-variable constructions, unpronounced elements with substantial consequences for interpretation and thought, etc. Prometheus had many advantages: capacities for complex thought, planning, interpretation, and so on. The capacity would then be transmitted to offspring, coming to predominate (no trivial matter, it appears, but let us put that aside). At that stage, there would be an advantage to externalization, so the capacity might come to be linked as a secondary process to the SM system for externalization and interaction, including communication \u2013 a special case, at least if we invest the term \u201ccommunication\u201d with some substantive meaning. It is not easy to imagine an account of human evolution that does not assume at least this much, in one or another form.","created_utc":1512753445,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

Instead of a cadre party, a mass party was proposed \u2013 meaning that conditions for joining were more flexible, as were rules for participating. Winning over by means of elections and mass struggle of a majority of the working class was seen as a necessary condition for moving toward socialism. The united front policy was proposed as the main way of carrying on this out. \n\nDoes anyone know which work by Lenin they are referring to here?

{"author":"communist_alt_acct","body":"I'm not sure, but I'd also be interested in an answer to this.\n\nIt's true that circumstances in places like Britain and the US were very different than that in Russia, but I'm not sure that the vanguard model needs to be discarded entirely. There have been some articles written in the last year about how various circumstances precluded the formation of even revisionist social democratic parties like the Labour Party or the Social-Democratic Party of Germany. One of the major factors is the two party system, which has been ossified since the late 19th century. In a nutshell, getting ballot access is incredibly difficult for anyone who isn't a Democrat or a Republican, and this system was by design. The two parties, although nominally at odds with each other, took considerable steps to shore each other up; for instance, a law in Florida said that any party that took at least 30% of the vote in a previous statewide election was guaranteed ballot access. One year the Republican Party's total dropped below 30%, and the law was hastily revised to set the floor at 25%.\n\nThese articles have also mentioned that in terms of ballot access and what the democratic process is like, the US has more in common with places like Singapore and Malaysia than it has with France, Britain, or Germany. This difference has implications for how we will have to organize ourselves, but I'm not sure what those implications are.\n\nIf Lenin actually thought this, I think he might have been wrong; I think there's just as much danger of a mass party in which conditions for joining and rules for participating are more flexible becoming opportunist and revisionist in the modern US as there was in Tsarist Russia. At the same time, it is clearly necessary to develop a mass base. A revolutionary government with no popular support will not last long.\n\nOur efforts in the US must also take into account the lingering effects of settler-colonialism, racism, and rugged individualist ideology. We have a mountain of work to do in terms of deprogramming people from thinking that wealth signifies being good, wise, fair, moral, deserving, strong, and clever, while being poor signifies being immoral, stupid, lazy, wicked, undeserving, and weak. We will have a long way to go to convince US Americans, especially white US Americans, that they are not in fact temporarily embarrassed millionaires, but rather are exploited (well, some of them are exploited, the bourgeoisie aren't), and that their bosses don't care about them except for how much they can squeeze out of them.\n\nSo, it seems that we've got a lot of propaganda work that needs to be done, as well as mass organizing, and party building.","created_utc":1512787644,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Raestagg","body":"u/1dividesinto2, I'd like to get your thoughts on the following, the implications of it, if you will. Here's a few selected excerpts from, \u201cShould We Participate in Bourgeois Parliaments?\u201d in Lenin\u2019s, \u201cLeft-Wing\u201d Communism: an Infantile Disorder\u201d as well as a selected excerpt from Stalin's \"The Foundations of Leninism\". My apologies on the length, I tried to make it concise, the piece in full is deserving of being read, really:\n\n\"It is with the utmost contempt\u2014and the utmost levity\u2014that the German \u201cLeft\u201d Communists reply to this question in the negative. Their arguments? In the passage quoted above we read:\n\n\u201c. . . All reversion to parliamentary forms of struggle, which have become historically and politically obsolete, must be emphatically rejected. . . .\u201d\n\nThis is said with ridiculous pretentiousness, and is patently wrong...\n\nA political party\u2019s attitude towards its own mistakes is one of the most important and surest ways of judging how earnest the party is and how it fulfills in practice its obligations towards its class and the working people.\n\nParliamentarianism is of course \u201cpolitically obsolete\u201d to the Communists in Germany; but\u2014and that is the whole point\u2014we must not regard what is obsolete to us as something obsolete to a class, to the masses.\n\nEven if only a fairly large minority of the industrial workers, and not \u201cmillions\u201d and \u201clegions\u201d, follow the lead of the Catholic clergy...it undoubtedly signifies that parliamentarianism in Germany has not yet politically outlived itself, that participation in parliamentary elections and in the struggle on the parliamentary rostrum is obligatory on the party of the revolutionary proletariat specifically for the purpose of educating the backward strata of its own class, and for the purpose of awakening and enlightening the undeveloped, downtrodden and ignorant rural masses. Whilst you lack the strength to do away with bourgeois parliaments and every other type of reactionary institution, you must work within them because it is there that you will still find workers who are duped by the priests and stultified by the conditions of rural life; otherwise you risk turning into nothing but windbags.\n\nThird, the \u201cLeft\u201d Communists have a great deal to say in praise of us Bolsheviks. One sometimes feels like telling them to praise us less and to try to get a better knowledge of the Bolsheviks\u2019 tactics. We took part in the elections to the Constituent Assembly, the Russian bourgeois parliament in September\u2013November 1917. Were our tactics correct or not?\n\nIf they were correct, then certain conclusions must be drawn.\n\n...the point is not whether bourgeois parliaments have existed for a long time or a short time, but how far the masses of the working people are prepared (ideologically, politically and practically) to accept the Soviet system and to dissolve the bourgeois-democratic parliament (or allow it to be dissolved).\n\n...the Bolsheviks did not boycott the Constituent Assembly, but took part in the elections both before and after the proletariat conquered political power. That these elections yielded exceedingly valuable (and to the proletariat, highly useful) political results has, I make bold to hope, been proved by me in the above-mentioned article, which analyses in detail the returns of the elections to the Constituent Assembly in Russia.\n\nThe conclusion which follows from this is absolutely incontrovertible: it has been proved that, far from causing harm to the revolutionary proletariat, participation in a bourgeois-democratic parliament, even a few weeks before the victory of a Soviet republic and even after such a victory, actually helps that proletariat to prove to the backward masses why such parliaments deserve to be done away with; it facilitates their successful dissolution, and helps to make bourgeois parliamentarianism \u201cpolitically obsolete\u201d.\n\nWe Bolsheviks participated in the most counterrevolutionary parliaments, and experience has shown that this participation was not only useful but indispensable to the party of the revolutionary proletariat, after the first bourgeois revolution in Russia (1905), so as to pave the way for the second bourgeois revolution (February 1917), and then for the socialist revolution (October 1917)\n\nIncidentally, apart from a number of other causes, that is why it is more difficult for Western Europe to start a socialist revolution than it was for us. To attempt to \u201ccircumvent\u201d this difficulty by \u201cskipping\u201d the arduous job of utilising reactionary parliaments for revolutionary purposes is absolutely childish. You want to create a new society, yet you fear the difficulties involved in forming a good parliamentary group made up of convinced, devoted and heroic Communists, in a reactionary parliament! Is that not childish?\n\nCriticism\u2014the most keen, ruthless and uncompromising criticism\u2014should be directed, not against parliamentarianism or parliamentary activities, but against those leaders who are unable\u2014and still more against those who are unwilling\u2014to utilise parliamentary elections and the parliamentary rostrum in a revolutionary and communist manner.\u201d Lenin - [Should We Participate in Bourgeois Parliaments?](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/lwc/ch07.htm)\n\nAlso of note, by Stalin, from \"The Foundations of Leninism\":\n\n\"Tactics change according to flow and ebb. While the strategic plan remained unchanged during the first stage of the revolution (1903 to February 1917), tactics changed several times during that period. In the period from 1903 to 1905 the Party pursued offensive tactics, for the tide of the revolution was rising, the movement was on the upgrade, and tactics had to proceed from this fact. Accordingly, the forms of struggle were revolutionary, corresponding to the requirements of the rising tide of the revolution. Local political strikes, political demonstrations, the general political strike, boycott of the Duma, uprising, revolutionary fighting slogans-such were the successive forms of the struggle during that period. These changes in the forms of struggle were accomplished by corresponding changes in the forms of organisation. Factory committees, revolutionary peasant committees, strike committees, Soviets of workers' deputies, a workers, party operating more or less openly-such were the forms of organisation during that period.\n\nIn the period from 1907 to 1912 the Party was compelled to resort to tactics of retreat; for we then experienced a decline in the revolutionary movement, the ebb of the revolution, and tactics necessarily had to take this fact into consideration. The forms of struggle, as well as the forms of organisation, changed accordingly: instead of the boycott of the Duma-participation in the Duma; instead of open revolutionary actions outside the Duma-actions and work in the Duma; instead of general political strikes-partial economic strikes, or simply a lull in activities. Of course, the Party had to go underground that period, while the revolutionary mass organisations were replaced by cultural, educational, co-operative, insurance and other legal organisations.\" - Stalin [The Foundations of Leninism: VII Strategy and Tactics](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1924/foundations-leninism/ch07.htm)","created_utc":1512875335,"score":9,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Okay I have a few thoughts about this. \n\n1. Since I was speaking shortly and rhetorically, I made my statement absolutist when it likely needs more nuance. However I hold by my statement in the non-absolutist sense because I think the history of the past 100 years proves that parliamentarism is in general a degeneration of a proletarian party into a social democratic party. \n\n2. I dont know my Russian history well, but it sounds like the Bolsheviks were in parliament for short amounts of time as a tactical maneouvre, not a long term strategy. In Russia, electoral democracy was something being fought for by popular movements and so was in-movement, or contestable. At all times, however, it was certain that not electoralism but proletarian politics were in command for the Bolsheviks: the former was a temporary tactic that might serve the latter, but the latter was never liquidated in favour of the former. \n\n3. Now if my argument is going to be that conditions are different today, that a statement as positive towards parliamentarism no longer applies, we had better look at some modern-historical example. Since I am a maoist, the best examples of modern proletarian politics exist(ed) in Peru, India, the Phillipines and Nepal. You might disagree with this, but I would challenge you to find another modern  communist movement that has managed to establish dual power in large parts of their country.\n\n4. Peru and India at the beginning of their people's wars were both ostensible democracies and had been for a while. In other words, this element of 'democracy' was no longer contestable. The PCP and CPI(Maoist) found great tactical success, not in engaging with parliament, but in staging electoral boycotts and ballot-burnings and so forth. Especially in India, there already exist many 'communist parties' engaging in parliamentarism who have devolced into social-democratic or semi-fascist jokes. The CPI(Maoist)'s success emerges precisely from making a decisive rupture with all forms of parliamentarism. \n\n5. In the Phillipines at some point in time, the military dictatorship got shifted into an ostensible democracy. The CPP staged electoral boycotts against the first election the Phillipines had seen, but later criticised this as an error. We might see a parallel between this and Russia - democracy was at this time contestable, so the CPP should have engaged with it - but as far as I know, the CPP have not engaged in much if any electoralism simce then and today are leading a people's war. \n\n6. Finally Nepal. The CPN(M) was leading a people's war and arguably was on the path to completely seizing power (in the stage of strategic offensive). Despite this, they joined an alliance with various bourgeois and reactionary parties for the sole goal of ending the monarchy. This alliance resulted in the CPN(M) choosing to liquidate their army, give up their weapons and destroy the institutions of dual power in the countryside, all in order for them to succeed in a reactionary parliament.  \n\n7. So to create a more nuanced position, I would argue that parliamentarism can be a particular tactic to be employed in a specific conjuncture where, on the basis of a genuine proletarian politics, it is decided that a temporary engagement might further the aims of the proletarian movement, but that this engagement cannot in any way liquidate the proletarian and miltary content of the organisation's program, nor be elevated to a general strategy. In general today, however, parliamentarism instead is the death of proletarian politics, if not the result of it already being dead in an organisation.","created_utc":1512912241,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"MrSkullgrinder","body":"I am not sure where to even begin. TL:DR at the bottom.\n\n&gt; We are the nation that dug out the Panama Canal, won two world wars, put a man on the moon and brought communism to its knees.\n\nOk let us begin with\n\n**World War I.**\n\nThe u$ did not join until the last year of the war and had a stance of neutrality until that point. The German empire was already losing and was going to lose with or without them. Taking credit for victories and accomplishments that your country barely had any involvement in is such an amerikan thing to do. I hate it so much whenever they depict world war one and show the u$ prominently as if they were actually extremely significant. \n\nNext\n\n**World war II Europe**\n\nThe u$ did not care in the slightest what was happening to the Jews in Europe, to the point they were planning on joining the Nazis if the Soviets were losing the war. Who ever was losing they would attack, Soviets or Nazis. Both the u$ and Britain wanted the Nazis to win and for the soviets to fall. (Those spooky scary Communists were a big threat to them.) They expected the Soviets to be absolutely demolished by the nazi forces. They wanted the Nazis to win. (Too bad T-34s existed) When the u$ finally truly joined the war and D-day began, the Nazis were already losing and being pushed back. And by the time lend lease took effect the Nazis were already losing (plus the Soviets only used about 10% of the lend lease.) The Soviets death count was twenty million, the u$? Four hundred thousand. For every amerikan soldier who died fighting the Nazis, 80 Soviet soldiers died doing the same.  Seven to eight out of every ten Nazi casualties were caused by Soviets. The remaining 20-30% has to be split between all the allies. The u$ really did not matter.\n\n**World war II Asia**\n\nNow this is the one part of WWII history that has been changed and warped by western historians more than any other. The u$ was not the most important part of the war in Asia. Not even close.\n\nChina was fighting close to 3\\4 of the Japanese military throughout almost the entirety of the war.\n&gt; In fact, more than two-thirds of the Japanese Army's strength was focused on the China theatre. During the initial stage of the Pacific War, 35 divisions out of a total of 51, including the strong Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in Northeast China, were pinned down. Thus Japan was able to employ only 10 or 11 divisions in the Pacific theatre, with the other five divisions stationed on Japanese islands.\n\n\nAnd the allies especially the u$, still struggled greatly against that. Losing multiple battles against only a little more than a fourth of Japan's military.\n\n&gt;As late as in 1944, large Japanese forces that were badly needed in the Pacific were still engaged in China. This was the case even by early August 1945.\n\n\nJapan sustained losses and casualties totalling 1.5 million in China and at the end of the war, China accepted the surrender of 1.28 million Japanese soldiers.\n\n\nBy comparison, the allied American, British, and Canadian forces killed, wounded and captured a total of 1.25 million of the Japanese forces. Which would mean 70% of Japanese forces were killed and captured by China... While the other allies combined only eliminated 30%.\nPlus the firebombing, nuking, and genociding of civilians that the u$ was doing had little affect on Japan's decision to surrender... The red army entering the war on the other hand... Well.... The emperor was not willing to become communist. He also knew that the Soviets would NEVER let him stay in power and would probably execute him. He at least had a chance with the u$\n\nChina suffered over twenty million casualties, the u$. Like I said four hundred thousand.\n\n\nSo no the u$ did not beat the Nazis, the Red army did. Nor did they beat Japan, China and the Red army did. Nothing about ww2 history gets forgotten and changed more than China's importance in the war. Western historians actively go out of their way to downplay China's importance in the war, to the point many comrades even believe they mattered less than the u$. Even if amerika had not entered either wars, the Nazis and Japan would have fallen to the Red army and China. It just would have taken longer.\n\n**Moon landing**\n\nTrue they did land on the moon, which only happened because Nazis built their rockets for them because NASA's rockets were so shit. But I feel that he is also implying they won the space race. Which they lost by a land slide. Not only were they constantly far behind the Soviets every step of the way, the Soviets also had a great response to the moon landing. **They built a fucking space station.** In fact multiple before the u$ could even build one. So yea they the landed on a rock, meanwhile the Soviets were building ways for people to live in space.\n\n&gt; As long as we have the courage of our convictions, and the strength to see them through, then there is no goal beyond our reach.\n\nSure hence why every rocket NASA built was blowing up and had to have Nazis build your rockets for you. Including the rockets that got you to the moon. The Nazis had to build those for you. So remember if you have the convictions and strength you can get Nazis to do your work for you.\n\n**Brought Communists to their knees.**\n\nAhem, Vietnam, China, DPRK, Cuba, East Germany, Soviet Union, Venezuela,  Mongolia, etc. The illegitimate United $tates has never beaten Communists. What brought the fall of the communist nations that fell was revisionism, not the u$. Even when you used [chemical warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange) and [rape as torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Program) you still could not beat Communists that you were even technologically superior than! The u$ military is large and expensive, but poorly trained and shit.

Only the proletarian class, which maintains the whole of society, has the power to bring about a successful social revolution. And now we see that, as the result of a far-reaching colonial policy the European proletariat has partly reached a situation where it is not its work that maintains the whole of society but that of the people of the colonies who are practically enslaved. . . . In certain countries these circumstances create the material and economic basis for infecting the proletariat of one country or another with colonial chauvinism. Of course this may perhaps be only a temporary phenomenon, but one must nevertheless clearly recognize the evil and understand its causes\u2026.\" - V. I. Lenin, Theses on Fundamental Tasks of The Second Congress Of The Communist International, 1920.\n\nAlso thought this was a very good point:\n\n&gt;history has shown that even the most exploited and oppressed working elements can be made a subject to the ideology of capital especially in the case of war. However, the difference being that the reactionary political expression of the labor aristocracy is reproduced materially and primarily at the base through its relationship in the social division of labor as well as the realization of value. This solidifies the labor aristocracy as a concretely privileged strata of the working class whose basic material interests rest alongside that of the bourgeoisie. In contrast, the reactionary political consciousness found in some working class elements is largely superstructural, interpellated through the ideology of the state or some deviant opportunism. The material relation of the proletarian masses does not necessarily posit them in alliance with monopoly capital as it would with the privileged labor aristocracy. This is a critical point of departure we must make if we are going to understand the faculties which compose the working class as well as its privileged elements.\n\nAlso this is interesting:\n\n&gt;Furthermore, their [the labour aristocracy's] concrete relationship to the social division of labor reproduced, materially, in their super-wages provides as a precondition for their own subsistence (read: privilege) the extension, expansion, and domination of capitalism.\n\nI read this as the labour aristocracy's privilege is the condition upon which capitalism continues. No privilege, no expansion, capital stagnates. The resultant effects of that process [if I could be allowed to hypothesise] would need to be expenditure of concentrated value thats not being realised, probably through war, or at least heightened arms trade. Comrade's criticism or comments on this?\n\n&gt;Why is the primary function [of the labour aristocracy] not the expansion of value like the rest of the working class? Simply by analyzing the objective data available we can discern that the labor aristocracy could not possibly produce all of the value it realizes. Therefore, the only function intuitively possible, absent of some undiscovered internalized contradiction, would be a reproductive function.\n\nI would describe this reproductive function as a pressure outlet for the accumulated value the bourgeoisie expropriates. Without the ability to sell commodities [accumulated value] crises of overproduction are inevitable. The role of the labour aristocrat is to ensure a certain level of consumption in order to maintain system stability. If I could be permitted to draw an abstract metaphor: imagine imperialism as a beehive and capital as the queen. Labour aristocrats are the drone bees bringing [consuming] back pollen [value] to the hive in order for it to become honey [profit]. The exploited periphery in this metaphor is represented by the flowers that produce the pollen. This could be a shaky analogy and, again, criticism and commentary are welcome and encouraged.\n\nEdit: formatting.

This allowed for Black Markets and emerging and strengthening of the nascent capitalist class, which used the crisis in capitalism (during 1980s) and the growing nationalistic idealism as a \"solution\" to disintegrate USSR. \n\nI think this is the correct analysis as as per Marxism a \"thing\" can only be quantitatively changed (not just grow bigger or smaller but become 'something else') from internal contradictions, outside forces only provide the circumstances and not the basis of change.

Although even in that case, lend lease for trucks from the other Allies only made up a little less than 30% of Soviet truck Numbers. The primary trucks they utilized being the [ZIS series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIS-6). Those were also the primary vehicles the iconic Katyusha rockets were mounted on. Weapons were also almost never used, with the easily produced mosin nagants and PPSHs being largely preferred. In total of the resources and equipment they received they only utilized about 10% of it. Western historians frequently count anything received by the Soviet Union as being used by them. It like much of what western historians say about WWII is a form of propaganda. The propaganda works like this, so you have to admit the war was won because of the Soviet Union, but you still want to take credit for it and downplay the Soviet victory. How do you do that? Say that the only reason the Soviets won was because of you. So if you had not gotten involved the war would have ended differently. Liberals and anti Communists love to use lend lease as a way to take away from the Soviets victory and over inflated the u$ importance.

{"author":"WikiTextBot","body":"**T-34**\n\nThe T-34 is a Soviet medium tank that had a profound and lasting effect on the field of tank design. At its introduction, the T-34 possessed an unprecedented combination of firepower, mobility, protection and ruggedness. Its 76.2 mm (3 in) high-velocity tank gun provided a substantial increase in firepower over any of its contemporaries; its well-sloped armour was difficult to penetrate by most contemporary anti-tank weapons. When first encountered in 1941, German general Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist called it \"the finest tank in the world\" and Heinz Guderian affirmed the T-34's \"vast superiority\" over existing German armour of the period.\n\n***\n\n**SU-100**\n\nThe SU-100 (Samokhodnaya Ustanovka 100) was a Soviet tank destroyer armed with a powerful 100 mm anti-tank gun in a casemate superstructure. It was used extensively during the last year of World War II and saw service for many years afterwards with the armies of Soviet allies around the world.\n\n***\n\n**Kliment Voroshilov tank**\n\nThe Kliment Voroshilov (KV) tanks were a series of Soviet heavy tanks named after the Soviet defence commissar and politician Kliment Voroshilov and used by the Red Army during World War II. The KV series were known for their heavy armour protection during the early part of the war, especially during the first year of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. In certain situations, even a single KV-1 or KV-2 supported by infantry was capable of halting large German formations. German tanks at that time were rarely used in KV encounters as their armament was too poor to deal with the \"Russischer Koloss\" - \"Russian Colossus\".\n\nThe KV tanks were practically immune to the 3.7 cm KwK 36 and howitzer-like, short barreled 7.5 cm KwK 37 guns mounted, respectively, on the early Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks fielded by the invading German forces.\n\n***\n\n**Yakovlev Yak-3**\n\nThe Yakovlev Yak-3 (Russian: \u042f\u0301\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043b\u0435\u0432 \u042f\u043a-3) was a World War II Soviet fighter aircraft. Robust and easy to maintain, it was much liked by pilots and ground crew alike. It was one of the smallest and lightest major combat fighters fielded by any combatant during the war. Its high power-to-weight ratio gave it excellent performance.\n\n***\n\n**ZIS-6**\n\nThe ZIS-6 (Russian: \u0417\u0438\u0421-6) is a Soviet general purpose 6\u00d74 army cargo truck, a three-axle version of the ZIS-5 two-axle truck. It was built from 1933 until October 1941 at the Moscow Zavod imeni Stalina factory and reached a total production of 21,239.\n\nThe robust and reliable base was used for many different bodies, for example as a searchlight truck or mobile workshop.

So this is the full thing without the source/link.\n\n&gt; Are there any sources that show they wanted the Nazis to win?\n\nYes but they do not say it out right. (Would you?) First look at the context and state of the war when Truman became president. It is April 1945, Nazi Germany is in ruins with the Soviet Union victorious. They just destroyed the world's strongest super power, something which no one, including the Nazis, thought could happen. What is there to defend? Nazi Germany has fallen, so his plan becomes pointless. No longer do you have any allies to help you fight the Red army (which at this point has a fully developed military) so instead you kill hundreds of thousands of civilians testing your new weapons in Japan to scare the Soviets. (It does not work and the Soviets build their own nukes.) But he was not alone in his desire to utilize bait and bleed tactics. With many other politicians desiring the same thing. Luckily none of these individuals were in office until 1945, when these tactics became useless. \n\nBut Truman was not the only who to some extent wanted the Nazis to win. Unlike Truman, Roosevelt (who was in office until 1944) truly desired for the Nazis and fascist Italy to win and continue their crimes. In fact he said it outright. \n\n&gt; \" I don\u2019t mind telling you in confidence that I am keeping in fairly close touch with the admirable Italian gentleman,\u201d Roosevelt wrote in a 1933 letter, referring to Mussolini.\n\nAnd \n\n&gt; \u201cI am much interested and deeply impressed by what he has accomplished and by his evidenced honest purpose of restoring Italy and seeking to prevent general European trouble.\u201d   \n\nAnd he was not alone in these feelings.\n\n&gt; \"The power systems in the United States were highly supportive of Mussolini. In fact even parts of the labor bureaucracy were. Fortune Magazine, for example, the major business journal, I think in 1932, had an issue with the headline, I\u2019m quoting it: \u2018The wops are unwopping themselves.\u2019\nThe \u2018wop\u2019 is a kind of a derogatory term for Italians, and the \u2018wops\u2019 are finally \u2018unwopping\u2019 themselves, under Mussolini they\u2019re becoming part of the civilized world.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe State department also had nice thing to say about Hitler.\n\n&gt; The State Department described Hitler as a moderate who was holding off the forces, the dangerous forces of the left, meaning the Bolsheviks, the labor movement and so on, and of the right, namely the extremist Nazis. Hitler was kind of in the middle, and therefore we should kind of support him.\u201c\n\n\"Hitler holding off the dangerous forces of the Bolsheviks... \" literally supporting Hitler and wanting him to win.\n\nAnyway hope that is enough to satisfy your desire for proof comrade!\n\nFor some reason the source is making auto moderator delete my comment. But it worked in my main comment. So if you want the source for all this, go to sources on the main comment and look for \"Roosevelt support for Mussolini and Hitler\". I just added that for you. That link is the source for all this. Hope that helps comrade.

From the get go America was never a democracy. That's why only property owners could originally vote. That's why we have the electoral college who decides trump is the president after he lost by 3 million votes. America isn't about freedom that's why originally had slavery and now we still do if you are incarcerated (that's why we have 25% of the worlds prison population). America has always about been about one thing: keeping money in the hands of the few. As a result the propaganda has been endless, they have done everything they can to subvert socialism in anyway as to make it appear less desirable so we don't rise up and demand our fair share. That's the reason why America had troops in Russia in 1918. That's the reason for U.S. troops in China during the Chinese revolution, the reason for the Korean War, the reason for he Vietnam War, the reason for the Bay of Pigs, the  red scare, McCarthyism, the embargo in Cuba, and countless other incidents.

Which is even more atrocious than just killing them because you think they are a disease. The nazi s were a little different in that they basically keep pristine records of everything.  Official historic records of Stalin  's evil regime say between at least 1.5-3 million people were ordered to be shot. Between 7-11 million died from starvation or dehydration. 1.7 million died in the gulag and 400,000 during the resettlement of the kulak. 600,000 deaths from ordered exile from 1943-1944. 150,000 of his own soldiers during ww2.  That's 14 million off the top of my head. I'm apologize if my estimate is not as close so I'll change my estimate to 20 million which is still doubling Hitler's numbers. As to the original question yes I think Stalin did something wrong. However I understand why he would do what he did. If he didn't kill these people or starve them he would have had to pay for them. If he has to pay for them the government losses money when i government loses money the people at the top of the chain lose power.

And why do our propagandists and agitators fail to go deeply into matters, only embellishing the fa\u00e7ade, and why do they merely copy and memorize foreign things, instead of working creatively? This offers us food for serious reflection.\n\nTen years have passed now since our Party was founded. Therefore, the Party members should naturally be educated in the history of our Party. If our functionaries are not educated in the revolutionary history of our country, they will be unable to carry forward our fine revolutionary traditions, nor will they be able to realize which direction to take in their revolutionary activities.\n\nWe should study our own things in earnest and be versed in them. Otherwise, we shall be unable to solve creatively in keeping with our actual conditions the new problems that confront us one after another in practice.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the form of our government should also be fitted to the specific conditions of our country.

No doubt, our platform, too, is in keeping with the realities of our country. \n\nOur functionaries often commit errors due to lack of a clear understanding of these matters.\n\nSome comrades working in the Propaganda Department of the Party tried to copy mechanically from the Soviet Union in all their work. This was also because they had no intention to study our realities and lacked the true Marxist-Leninist spirit of educating the people in our own merits and in the traditions of our revolution. Many comrades swallow Marxism-Leninism whole, instead of digesting and assimilating it. It is therefore self-evident that they are unable to display revolutionary initiative.\n\n...[S]ome comrades might take it simply and form a wrong idea that we need not learn from foreign countries. That would be quite wrong. We must learn from the good experiences of socialist countries.\n\nIt is important in our work to grasp revolutionary truth, Marxist-Leninist truth, and apply it correctly to the actual conditions of our country. There can be no set principle that we must follow the Soviet pattern. Some advocate the Soviet way and others the Chinese, but it is not high time to work out our own?\n\nThe point is that we should not mechanically copy forms and methods of the Soviet Union, but should learn from its experience in struggle and Marxist-Leninist truth. So, while learning from the experience of the Soviet Union, we must put stress not on the forms but on learning the essence of its experience.\n\nJust copying the forms used by others instead of learning Marxist-Leninist truth brings us no good, only harm.\n\nBoth in revolutionary struggle and in construction work, we should firmly adhere to Marxist-Leninist principles, applying them in a creative manner to suit the specific conditions of our country and our national characteristics.\n\nIf we mechanically apply foreign experience, disregarding the history of our country and the traditions of our people and without taking account of our own realities and level of preparedness of our people, dogmatic errors will result and much harm will be done to the revolutionary cause. To do so is not fidelity to Marxism-Leninism nor to internationalism; it runs counter to them.\n\nMarxism-Leninism is not a dogma, it is a guide to action and a creative theory. So, Marxism-Leninism can display its indestructible vitality only when it is applied creatively to suit the specific conditions of each country. \n\nI have so far touched upon some problems arising in the ideological work of our Party. I hope you will take account of them, eliminating the shortcomings hitherto revealed and strive to raise our Party's ideological work to a higher level.\"\n\n[On eliminating dogmatism and formalism and establishing Juche in ideological work](https://www.marxists.org/archive/kim-il-sung/1955/12/28.htm)","created_utc":1513187026,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

I suggest we expand on Marxism-Leninism and Marxism-Leninism-Maoism as a whole in order to create a more complete ideology. I believe Maoism is better because it's an expansion of theory under the Chinese situation. I think many of the Maoist ideas such as the People's war (Military strategy) Mass Line (Mass democratic participation) and the structure of the communist parties are great ideas and could be greatly expanded upon in relation to the First world, while other theories and ideas were often specific to the chinese situation.

{"author":"xplkqlkcassia","body":"laos is an interesting story - the lao people's revolutionary party made a number of critical errors early on in their programme. probably their biggest error was approaching the class situation in laos by mechanically reapplying the strategy of the cpi in vietnam. because laos didn't have a developed and entrenched landlord class (most agriculture was carried out cooperatively by peasants) they ended up mishandling relations with peasants, turning sections of the peasantry into antagonistic forces. after a series of civil wars, coups, droughts, and floods, the leader of the lprp (kaysone phomvihane) announced the new economic mechanism (nem, similar to the nep) in 1986.\n\nafter the dissolution of the ussr, laos was forced to appeal to the world bank and the imf for financial assistance - and (unsurprisingly) they demanded economic liberalization and more market reforms. nevertheless, the lprp is still committed to marxism-leninism, and has continued using economic planning.\n\nthe degree of state ownership is hard to tell because there's no centralized, publicly available list of laotian state-owned enterprises \u2013 government stakes in private enterprises also tend to be very opaque. afaik, there are ~130 reported state-owned enterprises with more than usd$5 billion in assets. those are mostly concentrated in key sectors like telecommunications, energy, finance, airlines, and mining. at a rough estimate, anywhere from 20% to 60% of the gdp of laos is directly coordinated in accordance with the five year national socio-economic development plans. ownership of land is restricted to 50-year-leases, which is similar to vietnam and china, and all national resources are publicly owned.\n\nthe position of the lprp is fairly strong, but there is still a long way to go in terms of development.","created_utc":1513328364,"score":18,"subreddit":"communism"}

So the capitalist sector, in the true meaning of the word, in which surplus value is extracted, comprises merely 27% of Vietnam's economy - with the domestic capitalists contributing just 8%, of and FDI contributing 19%. 57% of Vietnam's workforce is self employed / working in family businesses (the \"mom and pop shops\").

{"author":"theredcebuano","body":"Let us first discuss the nature of historical progression. Marxism points out that it is the development of classes and subsequently their relation to the productive forces and relations that progresses history. Feudalism was not destroyed by a single revolution in France, but rather the historical conflict between the liberal bourgeoisie which had stood up as a force gathering the masses and the despotic feudal lords. This conflict came about from economic demands - the bourgeoisie wanted their industrial private property and the feudal lords wanted their landed property. In the end, the feudal lords were overthrown. However, it did not stop feudalism from resisting and coming back to France, indeed it took a couple tries before capitalism was fully consolidated. \n\nWhy do I bring up the topic of historical materialism here? If we are to have a discussion about socialism, we need to first understand what the word really means. I started off my argument erroneously by pointing at the amount of state ownership is within the country. However, state ownership, as you have said, does not determine whether a country is socialist or not. Many capitalist countries in Latin America have huge amounts of state ownership yet are not socialist in nature. 60% of Iran's industries are under state ownership, and certainly Iran cannot be ascribed as a socialist state. Instead, what we have to look at first is the general direction of the economy - is political and economic power held by the proletariat or the bourgeoisie? We say \"direction\" because class struggle continues under socialism - the proletariat and bourgeoisie fight for power in a different way. When this power is held by one class, social relations necessarily differ and begin to change. Therefore, it is important to look at the growth of state owned enterprises and their structure. \n\nIt is a common fact that Khrushchov was a revisionist. His economic policy was encapsulated in the line of \"planning from the bottom up.\" What this meant was that enterprises had their own autonomy and could dispose of their capital as needed - ergo, it was the manager or director of the enterprise that was in control, not the workers and their interests. At some point, this made a qualitative leap that turned the USSR in that period into basically a social democracy. \n\nExcuse me for my long introduction, but for the purposes of the argument, I might find this necessary. Socialism is not a stage in society - it is a transition, a transition that moves back and forth in a tug of war between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. \n\nWhen the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North) was established, it had the dilemma of trying to industrialize and develop an agrarian economy. Facing this problem, they adopted the Soviet economic model of planning, albeit rigidly, which, although it had its flaws, did work. SOEs were built, private companies were nationalized and industry and agriculture both rose up. However, when North Vietnam and South Vietnam were reunited, the North Vietnamese quickly nationalized the Southern economy. I feel as though this was a mistake, perhaps of an \"Left\" kind as it did not recognize the role of the national bourgeoisie in helping develop the economy. Again, they followed the Soviet model rigidly. A comrade once noted that Ho Chi Minh had an incorrect analysis of classes in Vietnam. I disagree, I think his class analysis was for the most part, correct, but there must have been some sort of mistakes that he could've created in his praxis that led to this. By this period, from 1961-1965, at least 90% of North Vietnam's economy was under state ownership and enterprises were treated as production units that followed the central plan. We could probably say that their level of socialist construction was high in this period. \n\nCome 1976-1980, the optimism of the leaders was reflected in the high targets that they set in the plan. They had a lot to build, new infrastructure, communications, repair, etc. - the problems that a newly unified war torn country would face. But despite the large investments made in industry in the Second Five Year Plan, the plan eventually failed. None of the targets were reached and by the end of the period, they were about to face an economic collapse.\n\nThe Third Plenum of the Communist Party of Vietnam in 1979 discussed the many issues that they were about to face. This was where the Doi Moi reforms were born, and most especially where Decree 25/C was declared. It allowed State Owned Enterprises to operate under three plans - the Central Government Plan, a second plan where the SOE was free in receiving and gaining inputs but could only produce the products as necessitated by the Central Government Plan i.e. a supplementary plan which they could sell at either a trading SOE or the free market, and the third plan which gave the SOE total freedom in producing what it wanted for the market. \n\nThis marked a change in relations of production. Whereas the NEP transitioned into centralization of the means of production in the hands of the proletariat, the Doi Moi reforms transitioned into deregulation of the means of production in the hands of the new bourgeoisie - in the form of the manager or secretary of the SOE. The SOE could gain profits from the second and third plan which they could dispense as capital. As such, due to the existence of the free market, it is totally wrong to say that the law of value and thus capital is not in motion in Vietnam. It is. Even during the first five year plan where it was fairly advanced in socialist construction, it still was although in a limited form. The SOEs, due to the Doi Moi reforms, were acting basically as private property. Ergo, if we wanna be technical, the \"capitalist sector\" comprises at least 56% of the economy, 60% if you count the cooperatives (which have aren't necessarily socialist property, they can act as private property in a capitalist setting). That leaves us with 30% small scale, perhaps \"semi-feudal\" form of property and 10% in the GDP for tax. \n\nVietnam is not socialist. If we see socialism as a transition from dying capitalism to nascent communism, they achieved a pretty advanced stage in their first five year plan but were forced to retreat due to the conditions they were facing and have never recovered from that retreat.

When we are identifying \u201camerika\u201d or \u201ckanada\u201d (or, more colorfully, amerikkka and klanada) it is in the spirit of the name-changes and spelling alterations that were pursued by communist and national liberation groups in the 1970s to underscore amerika\u2019s \u201cklannish\u201d and illegitimate nature. The same goes for the use of the term \u201ckanada\u201d or \u201cklanada\u201d as the colonial states of North Amerika all share a common history of settlerism and barbaric violence. So we like to both highlight their lack of legitimacy as states and nations existing on this continent, as well as highlight the racist and colonial nature of those states. This is a practice we have inherited from groups like the New Afrikan Independence Movement and the Maoist Internationalist Movement. More can be read on their usage of the terms with links we will provide below. \n\nAs for other changes, such as our use of \u201cNorth Amerika\u201d and \u201cSouth/Latin Amerika\u201d it is to highlight the colonial and artificial nature of these terms to describe lands which had names before the arrival of the invading europeans. We further decapitalize all names of states and international organizations which represent western imperialism. This is also the reason behind the use of less-known terms for places which are either the traditional or new names given by the colonized people. This is the case with \u201cazania\u201d rather than \u201cSouth Africa\u201d (which we sometimes term as \u201csouth afrika\u201d for the same effect as with \u201camerika\u201d and such). \n\nEssentially, despite the kind of diverse usage of these spellings and their origins, what is the overriding reason for our use of them is in order to give oral power to the tradition of anti-colonialism. The oppressed name the world, and we want our rhetorical opposition to the united $tates, its legitimacy, and its imperialism to be thoroughly voiced in all our statements.

Socialism is a transitional period, not a mode of production\n\n\n2. The managers and secretaries of SOEs in Vietnam constitute a capitalist class\n\n\n3. SOEs in Vietnam are de-facto private property\n\n\nall of which is debatable. I think to address all of these simultaneously and produce an analysis of Vietnam would require a separate submission/thread since it will definitely be a lengthy discussion. Nonetheless, I do think it's correct to characterize Doi Moi as a retreat, since a counter-revolution would have very clear ramifications. Also, I suppose the question of socialism in Vietnam is not the most pressing in the short term, given the current political situation and the level of consciousness of the masses. Vietnamese communists, whether within the CPV or outside the CPV, recognize the immediate tasks right now is to defend the gains of the August Revolution, and prevent threats of imperialist backed regime change.

{"author":"HeyNomad","body":"Sure. It's been about ten years since I taught high school, so my memory of the specifics might be a little fuzzy, but I can at least talk about some of the general issues. Also, gotta point out again that every state is going to have their own little twists on all of this; I only taught in Indiana and California.\n\nOne of the biggest factors for me personally was the various exams students would have to take. In California at the time I was teaching, that included exams as a [graduation requirement](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/hs/). (The state-level graduation exams were mostly about reading and math skills, but counties/districts could supplement them.) I think it's relaxed a little bit since then, but at the time *testing testing testing* was all the craze in mainstream thinking about \"school reform.\" So my students could suffer if I failed to teach what the state had decided was history or economics (those were my two main subjects).\n\nI also had direct supervision (sometimes more intense, sometimes less) from administration, school board members, more senior teachers in the department, etc. The state, and/or sometimes the district, had pretty clearly defined areas of knowledge, sets of facts, perspectives, etc., that had to be found in my teaching. They had a variety of ways of disciplining me if I fell short. Mostly the only one that got any traction was straight-up firing, but it was fairly clear to me that it didn't take much for something to become a fireable offense.\n\nAnd finally, most of my materials (books, worksheets [eyeroll], whatever) were provided by the schools. So I could use those often terrible materials and just try to insert alternate perspectives, refutations, etc. But that was a pain in the ass in various ways for both me and the students. Or I could use other, better materials, which I would provide or which I would require my students to get. But that would involve extra effort and cost for me and/or my students.\n\nIn sum, I was a young teacher (ie, both young and early in my career), so I was pretty heavily supervised, and relatively underpaid and overworked. All of the above made it difficult to teach too far outside of the mold, and I put myself and my students at risk if I tried. \n\nSo after a few years I gave up on my idea of flying below the radar, doing some good when and where I could, \"changing the system from within.\" I'm definitely not saying braver and more skilled or creative teachers couldn't do that; if I'd been willing/able to stick it out a bit longer, maybe I could have too. (Although I actually do think I'm a pretty good teacher. Just saying.) It just got too difficult and painful for *me*.\n\nEdit: just clarifying a few points.","created_utc":1513398458,"score":22,"subreddit":"communism"}

Linden clearly holds that what emerged in the USSR was a new kind of exploiting class unknown to Marxism.\n\nMarcel van der Linden's argument can be refuted based on the fact that he misunderstood Bordiga's position.\n\nHe claims that Bordiga defined capitalism solely on the existence of commodity exchange and money, which is wrong. Here is an excerpt from Bordiga's article \"Dialogue with Stalin\", which you should actually read.\n\n&gt;When he [Stalin] wants to establish that commodity production and capitalism are not absolutely identical, Stalin again makes use of our method. Following the historical course backwards, he points out, like Marx, that in certain forms of society (slavekeeper order, feudalism, etc.) the commodity production existed but \"did not lead to capitalism\". This is indeed what Marx says in a passage of his historical summary, but he has developed it quite differently and with a completely different aim. The bourgeois economist claims that the system of commodity production is the only possible mechanism to combine production with consumption - he knows all too well that as long as this mechanism is in place, capital will continue to dominate the world. Marx replies: We will see where the historical trend is heading; first of all, I force you to acknowledge the irrefutable facts of the past: it wasn't always commodity production that ensured that the consumer was supplied with the product of labour. As examples, he mentions the primitive societies based on collecting and direct consumption, the ancient forms of the family and the tribe, the feudal system of direct consumption within self-sufficient circles, in which the products did not have to take on a commodity form. With the development and complexity of technology and needs, sectors emerge that are first supplied by barter trade and then by actual trade. Which proves that commodity production, including private property, is neither \"natural\" nor, as the bourgeois claims, permanent and eternal. The late appearance of commodity production (the system of commodity production, as Stalin says) and its existence on the sidelines of other modes of production serve Marx to show that commodity production, after it has become universal, just after spread of the capitalist production system, must go down with it.\n\n&gt;It would take too long if we wanted to cite the Marxist passages directed against Proudhon, Lassalle, Rodbertus and many others, denouncing any attempt to reconcile commodity production with the socialist emancipation of the proletariat.\n\n&gt;For Lenin, this is the cornerstone of Marxism. It would be quite difficult to reconcile it with Stalin's current thesis: \u201cWhy then, one asks, cannot commodity production similarly serve our socialist society for a certain period\u201d or \u201cCommodity production leads to capitalism only if there is private owner-ship of the means of production, if labour power appears in the market as a commodity which can be bought by the capitalist and exploited in the process of production, and if, consequently, the system of exploitation of wageworkers by capitalists exists in the country.\u201d This hypothesis is, of course, absurd; in the Marxist analysis, any existence of a mass of commodities suggests that reserve-less proletarians had to sell their labour-power. If in the past there was commodity production limited to a few branches, it was not because the labour-power was sold \"voluntarily\" as it is today, but rather because it was squeezed by force of arms from enslaved prisoners or serfs in personal dependency. Do we have to quote the first two lines of \"Capital\" again? \u201cThe wealth of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as \u2018an immense accumulation of commodities\u2019\u201d.\n\nIt is clear that Marcel van der Linden is wrong.\n\nThe reason why the USSR was capitalist to Bordiga was because of the existence of generalised commodity production. Generalised commodity production is capitalism. Generalised commodity production necessitates the commodification of labour power because, as Bordiga says, the existence of a mass of commodities on the market suggests that proletarians had to sell their labour power.\n\nYou may not agree with what Bordiga is arguing, but don't warp what he is saying.\n\n&gt;Good point. \"Dialogue with Stalin\" is a bad article, as has about as much value to the international communist movement as \"Did Stalin Poison Lenin?\" by Leon Trotsky and other exciting insights into the mind of embittered, irrelevant renegades.\n\nDon't say anything unless you've read the article.","created_utc":1513420795,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

If the one falls, then the other must fall too.\n\n- [Karl Marx, Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts, 1844](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1844/epm/1st.htm#s4)\n\n&gt;But, the transformation \u2014 either into joint-stock companies and trusts, or into State-ownership \u2014 does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces. In the joint-stock companies and trusts, this is obvious. And the modern State, again, is only the organization that bourgeois society takes on in order to support the external conditions of the capitalist mode of production against the encroachments as well of the workers as of individual capitalists. The modern state, no matter what its form, is essentially a capitalist machine \u2014 the state of the capitalists, the ideal personification of the total national capital. The more it proceeds to the taking over of productive forces, the more does it actually become the national capitalist, the more citizens does it exploit. The workers remain wage-workers \u2014 proletarians. The capitalist relation is not done away with.\n\n- [Friedrich Engels, Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, 1880](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch03.htm)\n\n&gt;Bordiga simply pretends that the existence of commodities equals the existence of capitalism in the USSR, effortlessly bypassing the need to take into account such minor things as relations to the means of production and the actual role of commodities in the Soviet economy.\n\nThe fact that this is not Bordiga's argument was already established earlier in the thread. Maybe you should actually read what he wrote, instead of going off of your own bullshit understanding?\n\n&gt;The law of value did not determine production in the USSR, whereas it very clearly does in capitalist countres.\n\nStalin admitted that it does:\n\n&gt;It is sometimes asked whether the law of value exists and operates in our country, under the socialist system.\n\n&gt;Yes, it does exist and does operate. Wherever commodities and commodity production exist, there the law of value must also exist.\n\n&gt;In our country, the sphere of operation of the law of value extends, first of all, to commodity circulation, to the ex-change of commodities through purchase and sale, the ex-change, chiefly, of articles of personal consumption. Here, in this sphere, the law of value preserves, within certain limits, of course, the function of a regulator.\n\n&gt;But the operation of the law of value is not confined to the sphere of commodity circulation. It also extends to production. True, the law of value has no regulating function in our socialist production, but it nevertheless influences production, and this fact cannot be ignored when directing production. As a matter of fact, consumer goods, which arc needed to compensate the labour power expended in the process of production, are produced and realized in our country as commodities coming under the operation of the law of value. It is precisely here that the law of value exercises its influence on production. In this connection, such things as cost accounting and profitableness, production costs, prices, etc., are of actual importance in our enterprises. Consequently, our enterprises cannot, and must not, function without taking the law of value into account.\n\n- [Joseph Stalin, Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR, 1951](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1951/economic-problems/ch04.htm)\n\n&gt;Consequently production in the USSR was based on creating use-values rather than producing for exchange.\n\nThis distinction of \"production for exchange\" with \"production for use\" is an absolute meme. Production is always for use, only the forms under which this takes place change.\n\n&gt;The labour-process, resolved as above into its simple elementary factors, is human action with a view to the production of use-values, appropriation of natural substances to human requirements; it is the necessary condition for effecting exchange of matter between man and Nature; it is the everlasting Nature-imposed condition of human existence, and therefore is independent of every social phase of that existence, or rather, is common to every such phase.\n\n- [Karl Marx, Capital Volume I, 1867](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch07.htm)\n\n&gt;Prices existed both for accounting purposes and to regulate consumption.\n\nSocialism encompasses the sublation of exchange between independent producers, therefore the absence of the value-form and consequently the absence of money.\n\n&gt;As values, commodities are social magnitudes, that is to say, something absolutely different from their \u201cproperties\u201d as \u201cthings\u201d.  As values, they constitute only relations of men in their productive activity.  Value indeed \u201cimplies exchanges\u201d, but exchanges are exchanges of things between men, exchanges which in no way affect the things as such.  A thing retains the same \u201cproperties\u201d whether it be owned by A or by B.  In actual fact, the concept \u201cvalue\u201d presupposes \u201cexchanges\u201d of the products.  Where labour is communal, the relations of men in their social production do not manifest themselves as \u201cvalues\u201d of \u201cthings\u201d.  Exchange of products as commodities is a method of exchanging labour, [it demonstrates] the dependence of the labour of each upon the labour of the others [and corresponds to] a certain mode of social labour or social production. \n\n- [Karl Marx, Theories of Surplus Value, 1863](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1863/theories-surplus-value/ch20.htm)","created_utc":1513424803,"score":22,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"HysniKapo","body":"&gt;Yes, truly the millions of workers in the USSR did not work wage labour.\n\nReceiving back from society based on what you've given it is separate from whether labor-power was a commodity.\n\n&gt;Do you even have the slightest idea of what a commodity is?\n\nJudging by what you just wrote, you clearly don't.\n\n\"The total wage payments for the economy, as well as their distribution by region, industry and occupation, are determined by the central plan. . . . allow[ing] a balance to be struck between total consumer purchasing power in the economy and the total value of consumer output, thus preventing either inflation or underconsumption. . . the tendencies of wage markets to perpetuate and generate inequality, as well as a reserve army of labour functioning to keep the level of wages down, are not manifested.\" (Al Szymanski, _[Is the Red Flag Flying?](https://archive.org/details/IsTheRedFlagFlying)_ pp. 47-48.)\n\nIn other words, this paragraph of Marx in the first volume of _Capital_ does not apply: \"The greater the social wealth, the functioning capital, the extent and energy of its growth, and, therefore, also the absolute mass of the proletariat and the productiveness of its labour, the greater is the industrial reserve army. The same causes which develop the expansive power of capital, develop also the labour power at its disposal. The relative mass of the industrial reserve army increases therefore with the potential energy of wealth. But the greater this reserve army in proportion to the active labour army, the greater is the mass of a consolidated surplus population, whose misery is in inverse ratio to its torment of labour. The more extensive, finally, the lazarus layers of the working class, and the industrial reserve army, the greater is official pauperism. This is the absolute general law of capitalist accumulation.\"\n\nOne can see that \"the absolute mass of the proletariat and the productiveness of its labour\" in the USSR during the early 30s were _not_ subject to the absolute general law of capitalist accumulation. The reserve army of labor driving wages down did not exist, because labor-power was not a commodity. That's why structural unemployment did not exist in Soviet society from the start of the 1930s till the last years of the 80s (i.e. not until _Perestroika_.)\n\nYour Marx and Engels quotes do not demonstrate that capitalism does not actually require capitalists, the latter simply points out how capitalists manage their affairs via the state and via joint-stock companies. The end result is still capitalists obtaining surplus-value. Marx himself in the _Grundrisse_ noted that, \"The concept of capital contains the capitalist.\"\n\n&gt;The fact that this is not Bordiga's argument was already established earlier in the thread.\n\nIt was not, the fact you're arguing it despite Bordiga supposedly not adhering to it is proof of that (just like left-coms who defend his asinine text on the Holocaust while saying \"but he totally didn't write it!\")\n\n&gt;Stalin admitted that it does:\n\nSoviet economists (e.g. Eugen Varga) subjected Stalin's book to numerous criticisms, including his understanding of the law of value. Let's compare Stalin's treatment with that of economist P.I. Nikitin in his _[Fundamentals of Political Economy](https://archive.org/details/NikitinFundamentalsPoliticalEcon)_ (1983, p. 312):\n\n&gt;In socialist society, the law of value does not regulate the distribution of the means of production and labour between the sectors of the national economy. . . . The law of value operates through the price mechanism, but the prices of goods are not set spontaneously under socialism, as they are under capitalism. They are planned. In setting prices, the socialist state proceeds from the socially necessary labour spent in producing them, i.e., from value. Thus, the state applies the law of value in practice.\n\nAs for this claim:\n\n&gt;Socialism encompasses the sublation of exchange between independent producers, therefore the absence of the value-form and consequently the absence of money.\n\nMarx himself in the third volume of _Capital_ notes that \"after the abolition of the capitalist mode of production, but still retaining social production, the determination of value continues to prevail in the sense that the regulation of labour-time and the distribution of social labour among the various production groups, ultimately the book-keeping encompassing all this, become more essential than ever.\"","created_utc":1513426699,"score":-6,"subreddit":"communism"}

Though in recent years we have made great efforts to economize on military and administrative expenses, the estimated expenditure on national defence and for administrative purposes will still account for 32 per cent of all state expenditure in the first five-year period...During the past few years, the national bourgeoisie has taken part in the rehabilitation of the national economy.

{"author":"corvibae","body":"I'd argue that it definitely does. Unlike what this guy is talking about, capitalism definitely is the problem. For instance, in the 19th Century, the powers of Europe targeted Mexico and installed a French Hapsburg as their imperialist monarch with the existence of the Mexican nobles who were angry that revolutionary elements existed that wanted to end the hacienda system and their feudal rights over the peasants. Another 19th century example would be British involvement in the opium trade in China. A 19th century Chinese emperor banned opium, and the British fought two wars to make sure that the addictive drug, grown in British controlled regions of modern day India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan were sold to the Chinese people. A significant majority of the population was addicted to the drug, and it was making a LOT of money for the British.\n\nModern day examples, like the video shows, occurred via the US in Libya and Iraq. In Iraq, Saddam Hussein had nationalized oil fields and refused to sell them to US companies. A major part of the invasion of Iraq in 2003 involved the seizure of the oil fields and turning them over to US corporations. Libya was a similar situation. Gaddaffi had nationalized the oil fields and production in Libya to prevent foreign capitalists from using them to exploit the workers of his country. Then during the so-called \"Arab Spring\" in the middle years of the Obama Administration, the US funded rebel groups in Libya to attack Gaddaffi's government there. There are now literal slave markets in the country. Literal. Slave. Markets. \n\nDescribing them as economic hitmen is in no way melodramatic. It's what they do, it's what they did. It's what they are continuing to do in the Ukraine, wherein they supported the rise of a right-wing dictator who controls massive business interests there against a legitimately elected leader. They are doing it in Syria as well, and in Afghanistan. The death toll from these wars, including civilians, are immeasurably high. ","created_utc":1513493119,"score":20,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"PalsyProssie","body":"I upvoted this because it's a valid point. \n\nLet's have a look at the opinions of people that experienced really existing communism. \n\n**East Germany**: Majority of east germans that lived in the GDR preferred life under communism \n\n&gt;Today, 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, 57 percent, or an absolute majority, of eastern Germans defend the former East Germany. \"The GDR had more good sides than bad sides. There were some problems, but life was good there,\" say 49 percent of those polled. Eight percent of eastern Germans flatly oppose all criticism of their former home and agree with the statement: \"The GDR had, for the most part, good sides. Life there was happier and better than in reunified Germany today.\"\n\nSource http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/homesick-for-a-dictatorship-majority-of-eastern-germans-feel-life-better-under-communism-a-634122.html\n\n**Hungary**: \n\n&gt; A remarkable 72% of Hungarians say that most people in their country are actually worse off today economically than they were under communism. Only 8% say most people in Hungary are better off, and 16% say things are about the same. In no other Central or Eastern European country surveyed did so many believe that economic life is worse now than during the communist era. This is the result of almost universal displeasure with the economy. Fully 94% describe the country's economy as bad, the highest level of economic discontent in the hard hit region of Central and Eastern Europe. Just 46% of Hungarians approve of their country's switch from a state-controlled economy to a market economy; 42% disapprove of the move away from communism. The public is even more negative toward Hungary's integration into Europe; 71% say their country has been weakened by the process.\n\nhttp://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2010/04/28/hungary-better-off-under-communism/\n\n**Romania**: \n\n&gt;The most incredible result was registered in a July 2010 IRES (Romanian Institute for Evaluation and Strategy) poll, according to which 41% of the respondents would have voted for Ceausescu, had he run for the position of president. And 63% of the survey participants said their life was better during communism, while only 23% attested that their life was worse then. Some 68% declared that communism was a good idea, just one that had been poorly applied.\n\nhttp://www.balkanalysis.com/romania/2011/12/27/in-romania-opinion-polls-show-nostalgia-for-communism/\n\n**Czech Republic** \n\n&gt;Roughly 28 percent of Czechs say they were better off under the Communist regime, according to a poll conducted by the polling institute SC&amp;C and released Sunday.\n\n  &gt;Only 23 percent said they had a better life now.\n\n &gt;More goods in shops, open borders and better cultural offer are considered the biggest successes of the system that was installed after 1989.\n\n &gt;On the other hand, the voucher privatisation, the worsening of human relations and work of the civil service are its biggest flaws, most Czechs said.\n \nhttps://archive.fo/bFYoy\n\n**Serbia** :\n\n&gt;A poll shows that as many as 81 per cent of Serbians believe they lived best in the former Yugoslavia -\"during the time of socialism\".\n\n&gt;The survey focused on the respondents' views on the transition \"from socialism to capitalism\", and a clear majority said they trusted social institutions the most during the rule of Yugoslav communist president Josip Broz Tito.\n\n&gt;The standard of living during Tito's rule from the Second World War to the 1980s was also assessed as best, whereas the Milosevic decade of the 1990s, and the subsequent decade since the fall of his regime are seen as \"more or less the same\".\n\n&gt;45 percent said they trusted social institutions most under communism with 23 percent chosing the 2001-2003 period when Zoran Djin\u0111ic was prime minister.

Only Azerbaijanis, Kazakhstanis, and Turkmens are more likely to see benefit than harm from the breakup. Georgians are divided.\n\nhttp://www.gallup.com/poll/166538/former-soviet-countries-harm-breakup.aspx\n\nUkraine, Lithuania and Bulgaria \n\n&gt;The poll showed 30 percent of Ukrainians approved of the change to democracy in 2009, down from 72 percent in 1991. In Bulgaria and Lithuania the slide was to just over half the population from nearer three-quarters in 1991. \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-communism-nostalgia/special-report-in-eastern-europe-people-pine-for-socialism-idUSTRE5A701320091108\n\n**Ex-Yugoslav states**\n\n&gt;People in the former Yugoslav countries, scarred by the ethnic wars from the 1990s and still outside the EU, are nostalgic for the socialist era of Josip Broz Tito when, unlike now, they traveled across Europe without visa.\n\n\u201cEverything was better then. There was no street crime, jobs were safe and salaries were enough for decent living,\u201d said Belgrade pensioner Koviljka Markovic, 70. \u201cToday I can hardly survive with my pension of 250 euros ($370 a month).\u201d  \n\n**Bulgaria** (seen as a golden era) \n\n&gt;In Bulgaria, the 33-year rule of the late dictator Todor Zhivkov begins to seem a golden era to some in comparison with the raging corruption and crime that followed his demise.\n\n&gt;Over 60 percent say they lived better in the past, even though shopping queues were routine, social connections were the only way to obtain more valuable goods, jeans and Coca Cola were off-limits and it took up to 10 years\u2019 waiting to buy a car.\n\n&gt;\u201cFor part of the Bulgarians (social) security turned out to be more precious than freedom,\u201d wrote historians Andrei Pantev and Bozhidar Gavrilov in a book on the 100 most influential people in the Balkan country\u2019s history. \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-communism-nostalgia/special-report-in-eastern-europe-people-pine-for-socialism-idUSTRE5A701320091108\n\n So all these ex-soviet/Yugoslav states have experienced the free market paradise for a quarter of a century now and they'd still rather return to autocratic and authoritarian communism than \"democratic capitalism\".(I wouldn't call most capitalist states democracies. Even Harvard and Princeton universities wrote peer reviewed papers on the US being an oligarchy and I don't really take the spirit of democracy to mean turning up every 4 years as a tick box exercise to vote for the person you hate the least in your gerry mandered district. But for the sake of arguement as most capitalists claim to democracy, let's accept at face value that capitalist states are democracies). \n\nThis means that a majority of east europeans that lived under communism would *rather throw democracy out the window and return to autocratic communism than live in \"freedom\"(TM) and capitalism*. \n\n\nAs that old joke in Russia goes in 1992 \"What did capitalism achieve in 1 year that communism couldn't achieve in 70? \n\n\"Make Communism look good.\" \n\nCheckmate :) ","created_utc":1513539900,"score":9,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"mitzadom","body":"&gt;History teaches us that no oppressed class ever did, or could, achieve power without going through a period of dictatorship, i.e., the conquest of political power and forceable suppression of the resistance always offered by the exploiters\u2014the resistance that is most desperate, most furious, and that stops at nothing. The bourgeoisie, whose domination is now defended by the Socialists who denounce \u201cdictatorship in general\u201d and extol \u201cdemocracy in general\", won power in the advanced countries through a series of insurrections, civil wars, and the forcible suppression of kings, feudal lords, slaveowners and their attempts at restoration. In books, pamphlets, Congress resolutions, and propaganda speeches, Socialists have everywhere thousands and millions of times explained to people the class nature of these bourgeois revolutions and this bourgeois dictatorship. That is why the present defense of bourgeois democracy under the cover of talk about \u201cdemocracy in general\", and the present howls and shouts against proletarian dictatorship under the cover of shouts about \u201cdictatorship in general\", are an outright betrayal of socialism. They are, in fact, desertion to the bourgeoisie, denial of the proletariat\u2019s right to its own, proletarian revolution, and a defense of bourgeois reformism at the very historical juncture when bourgeois reformism throughout the world has collapsed and the war has created a revolutionary situation.\n\n&gt;The Paris Commune \u2014to which all who parade as Socialists pay lip service (for they know that the workers ardently and sincerely sympathize with though Commune) \u2014showed very clearly the historically conventional nature and limited value of the bourgeois parliamentary system and bourgeois democracy; institutions which, though highly progressive compared with medieval times, inevitably require a radical alteration in the era of proletarian revolution. It was Marx who best appraised the historical significance of the Commune. In his analysis, he revealed the exploiting nature of bourgeois democracy in the bourgeois parliamentary system under which the oppressed classes enjoy the right to decide once in several years which representative of the propertied classes shall \u201crepresent and suppress\u201d ( ver- und zertreten ) the people in parliament. And it is now, when the Soviet movement is embracing the entire world and continuing the work of the Commune for all to see, that the traitors to socialism are forgetting the concrete experience and concrete lessons of the Paris Commune and repeating the old bourgeois rubbish about \u201cdemocracy in general\u201d. The Commune was not a parliamentary institution.\n\n&gt;The significance of the commune, furthermore, lies in the fact that it endeavored to crush, to smash to its very foundations, the bourgeois state apparatus, the bureaucratic, judicial, military and police machine, and to replace it by a self-governing, mass workers\u2019 organization in which there was no division between legislative and executive power. All contemporary bourgeois-democratic republic\u2019s, including the German republic\u2014which the traitors to socialism, in mockery of the truth, describe as a proletarian republic\u2014retain this state apparatus. We therefore again get quite clear confirmation of the point that shouting in defense of \u201cdemocracy in general\u201d is actually defense of the bourgeoisie and their privileges as exploiters.\n\n","created_utc":1513703801,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

If the growth of China is attributable to capitalism having already come into existence, then \n\n&gt;Income inequality cannot be resolved under capitalism\n\nThis cannot simultaneously be true. You also cannot believe that \n\n&gt;When the Party endorses the total privatization of the economy, the workers will inevitably lose their ability to organize...then the bourgeoisie will use that Party to reorganize that society in their own interests\n\nAnd\n\n&gt;Xi Jinping was forced to recognize the uneven development of the forces of production at the 19th Party Congress (and declared it the new primary contradiction) after several decades of the CPC ignoring it because the people in the countryside demand a better standard of living\n\nAt the same time. What is the method by which the \"demands\" of the countryside are recognized and Incorporated into policy? What is the significance of Xi's personality? Why does this not occur in other third world nations? Your explanation, that this is because China went so socialist there are still vestiges in the current capitalist regime, makes no sense at all. We are talking about class power, and class power needs a mechanism and not vague liberal ideas of \"power.\"\n\nDecide if China is imperialist (which is a stage of capitalism with particular features which can be defined and empirically derived) or developing towards imperialism. Same with capitalism. Then you have to explain why Xi appears to be moving *away* from this. \n\nYou also cannot simultaneously believe that Chinese development is determined by the whims of the global market and has developed the standard of living for the simple reason that the rest of the world has gone backwards in standard of living except China. More concretely, the development of the world market is predicated on a race to the bottom of wages and working conditions through competition between third world manufacturers and nations as John Smith so elegantly shows. You can believe China is doing this and I think Martin-hart Landsberg shows this somewhat convincingly (though the political ramifications are less clear). But you cannot simultaneously believe this led to development because it contradicts everything we know about neoliberalism and imperialism more generally. Honestly I would be more interested in a study of Vietnam which is much more ambiguous, all this stuff about China just seems like the zombie version of \"Soviet imperialism\" which was the left veneer for pro-imperialist socialism (ironically it served as the cover for Chinese revisionism and is now being revived against the Chinese for far less grand purposes).\n\nRegardless, there is a new analysis of Chinese imperialism by the Indian maoists on bannedthought which has yet to be translated into English. I'll wait for that, hopefully it will shed some light on these up to now tired and polemical debates.\n\nE: I like the effort you've put in, sorry if it comes off the opposite.

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"\"Excess\" is an ex-post facto justification. You don't have to be rage against the machine to know that winners write history but it helps. There were many \"excesses\" during the Russian civil war (and the Chinese civil war as well) but this did not stop the revolution from being victorious. What makes Robespierre, Saint-Just and Marat \"excessive\" but Barras, Fouche and eventually Napoleon not? Before you answer, remember that to the Soviets these figures were not excessive enough, the popular understanding of the revolution is a reactionary narrative crafted by British scholarship Americans have inherited. \n\n&gt;Robespierre provided a theoretical foundation for the new, higher form of organization of revolutionary power that replaced the constitutional regime\u2014the revolutionary democratic dictatorship, the need for which was understood more rapidly and more clearly by Robespierre than by other Jacobin leaders. In a speech to the Convention on Dec. 25, 1793, Robespierre described the essence of revolutionary government: \u201cThe revolution is the struggle of freedom against its enemies; the constitution is the regime of a victorious and peaceful freedom\u201d (Izbr. proizv., vol. 3, p. 91, 1965).\n\n&gt;In July 1793, Robespierre became the head of the Committee of Public Safety. He played a crucial role in the mobilization of popular forces and the achievement of victory over foreign and domestic counterrevolution. However, his political activity was marked by contradictions rooted in the very character of the Jacobin dictatorship. His revolutionary traits were intertwined with the limited capacities and duplicity characteristic of bourgeois politicians. For example, Robespierre struggled not only against the followers of G. J. Danton, who attacked the revolutionary government from the right, but also against left-wing social forces, including P.-G. Chaumette and his supporters. He also insisted on strictly enforcing a maximum wage, and he upheld other similar measures. Robespierre was mistaken in his attempts to unify the nation around a new, republican religion (the cult of the Supreme Being), the fallacy of which he soon realized.\n\n&gt;Although Robespierre was aware of increasing opposition to the Jacobin dictatorship and the futility of his efforts, he did not take effective measures to prevent the conspiracy that was developing against him. He was absent from the Convention for six weeks (until July 26), and at the end of June 1794, he left the Committee of Public Safety. On July 26, 1794, he attempted unsuccessfully to persuade the Convention to censure the conspirators. The counterrevolutionary Thermidor coup (July 27\u201328, 1794) led to the fall of the Jacobin dictatorship. Robespierre and his closest supporters were arrested and guillotined without trial.\n\nFrom the Great Soviet Encyclopedia.\n\nThat's not to say you're wrong, merely you haven't said anything substantive. The popular understanding of the cultural revolution may be power politics and big character posters but communists know the real revolution was in Long Bow Village and the millions like it and in the Shanghai commune and revolutionary committee.  You've simply taken the explanation of the current Chinese CCP (at least the rightist faction) as fact and used it to tie a neat little bow over history. Those people are enemies of the revolution and it is confusing you would take their narrative as anything more than ex-post facto justification of the current reactionary theories of \"social harmony\" and \"corruption\" rather than class struggle. Ironically, in trying to define China as capitalist, you've gone far to the right. The logic is obvious: one cannot believe the cultural revolution was the \"furthest advance\" towards communism and be so easily defeated. One cannot also believe that it was against capitalist roaders and so easily was taken over by them if it had real democratic character. I believe the answer lies not in our theory but our history, despite the immense value the cultural revolution has for communists, actual historical study of it is pathetic. Most communists don't even care what happened past 1970 and popular understanding has gone backwards in both Chinese and American communist study. The best work I know which takes it seriously and not as a mere fetish of actualized communism in the minds of progressive American communists and reactionary Chinese politicians hasn't even been translated into English (or Chinese to my knowledge), most work is just reactions against bourgeois propaganda. None of this is the fault of communists, the institutional support that existed for such study no longer exists and China makes it very difficult, but even the knowledge that does exist is mostly neglected for ill-informed polemics from defunct 80s/90s maoist movements and some blog from a philosophy adjunct.\n\nYou're talking about the army. What was the class interest of the army?  Why was Zhoi Enlai \"loved\" by most people and what are \"people\" in a political sense? Trotsky was surely loved but this did not stop his exile for opposing the party's rules on factions and breaking democratic centralism (something I'm sure peasants did not feel strongly about until it was explained to them). How could the party be too far ahead of the masses when it was the target of the cultural revolution in the first place? Your explanation needs work and doesn't mention class at all, a sure sign that postmodern \"power\" is being used under the guise of Marxism (the amorphous concept of the \"masses\" is a sure sign as well, that term has a very particular meaning which I don't believe has much use in English).","created_utc":1513795770,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Blackbelt54","body":"I'm not going to respond in full to this post but I do want to make a few points:\n\n&gt; You simply cannot develop capitalism while also developing socialism. \n\nWhat was the NEP under Lenin, then? Can only one mode of production exist in a given society? I would argue no, that multiple can coexist, although one MoP will always have dominant sway over the motion of development.\n\n&gt; Compare this to the development of the People\u2019s Communes during the Great Leap Forward, which prioritized the development of the forces of production in rural areas under socialist, common ownership, as opposed to bourgeois development.\n\nExcept it didn't. GDP decreased sharply during the GLF and at certain points production grinded to a halt. The GLF wasn't a total genocidal disaster as anti-communists claim but it was certainly a voluntaristic attempt to springboard the economy. Sure, heavy industry developed but energy and raw materials lagged far behind due to poor planning.\n\n&gt; While infrastructure in Zambia is still being developed by China, Zambian exports to China are an essential component of this. Zambia in effect structures its economy to export to China. This closely resembles a colonial relationship.\n\nHow is this not just, you know, trade? Is all trade colonial? Does the fact that China pursues long-term trading and infrastructure development while the imperialist countries pursue high-interest short-term trading mean nothing? Economic independence does not mean economic isolation.\n\n&gt; If China was so interested only in the betterment of other nations, why would it uphold sanctions against DPRK?\n\nOf course it would be ideal if China could simply ignore the sanctions and protect the DPRK but I don't know if you are giving enough thought to how serious the global situation is. China is also under the gun of US/NATO imperialism and they realize that they have to cooperate to some degree to remain in good standing within the UN. Of course that doesn't make sanctions excusable but we have to be realistic about what China can do in this situation. On top of that, China's trade with the DPRK has actually been [increasing](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/13/world/asia/china-north-korea-trade-coal-nuclear.html) overall, especially [food exports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-food-exports-to-north-korea-surge-1506509181). China often agrees to sanctions against DPRK and either fails to enforce them or supplements in other areas of trade.\n\n&gt; Why would it provide arms to the Duterte government who is involved in cracking down on a genuine revolutionary communist movement? This sounds more like a country led by a national bourgeoisie invested in its own business interests than an internationalist proletarian one.\n\nI don't think weapons deals with the Duterte government are defensible, to be clear. But I don't think this means China is capitalist. Consider the foreign policy during the Mao years, especially during the 1970s. China supported reactionary forces across the globe after the Sino-Soviet Split, including the South African apartheid-aligned UNITA in Angola, the Shah of Iran, Pinochet, and other reactionary forces in Egypt, Puerto Rico, Portugal, Sri Lanka, and Oman. Did this mean China wasn't socialist under Mao?\n\n","created_utc":1513802250,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"This has been posted before and I think I gave a more substantive response then. But basically this this a repetition of Khrushchev's attack on Stalin and the purges/rapid industrialization (which itself is a repetition of the attack of the Mensheviks on Lenin) and collectivization of the 30s applied to China. The conditions are the same for Western socialists, having the great nation of China as a member of the socialist camp is much more comforting than seeing it as an enemy, and sure enough even in the revolutionary conditions of the 60s anti-Soviet communists never reached the power or prestige as the pro-Soviet communists of the 30s and were never able to challenge the third International (and despite how we wish history was, in Europe these trends were never close to the Eurocommunist parties). I sympathize. But that argument already came and went, and while the anti-revisionist movement couldn't predict China or even survive being \"right\" about the Soviet Union, the pro-revisionist movement fared no better. Dengism won't survive any more than Kruschevism did and the rhetoric of Xi isn't much more significant than Brezhnev's who in no way stopped the rot of the system. That's not to say China is doomed or that capitalism has won. But this analysis is just pure apologia for revisionism, particularly the section on the \"class basis\" of Maoism which is just nonsense (in what universe is first world petty-bourgeois ideology equivalent to third world peasant movements? How does your analysis explain the Maoist movements of today in India, the Philippines, and Peru which cannot be reduced to such crude generalizations, let alone the complexity of Chinese maoists during the height of the cultural revolution and today? The existence of three-in-one combinations shows that there are at least three major forces struggling for power, the mass organizations being the main ones and being entirely absent from your analysis). Your analysis doesn't really engage with Maoism to be honest, you need to at minimum take the discussions of Soviet revisionism and material incentives that occurred throughout the socialist world at the time seriously instead of pretending this was something Mao dreamt up.","created_utc":1513820005,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"xplkqlkcassia","body":"Something important to acknowledge is that a major factional struggle is playing out in the CPC at the moment (maybe it would be better described as a line struggle, since factionalism is not permitted) that is likely to decide the future of China. \n\nA Chinese comrade described the main factions as the liberals, the nationalists, and the Maoists. (It would be more accurate to describe the liberals and the nationalists as the right-wing of Marxism-Leninism in the CPC and the Maoists as the left-wing of Marxism-Leninism in the CPC, but I think the liberal/nationalist/Maoist labels are more helpful because they roughly correspond to different trends within liberal bourgeois politics.) Because no faction totally dominates, very often you can see bizarre compromises and contradictions, such as in Xi Jinping's address during the 19th National Congress of the CPC, which not only emphasized widening the role of market allocation (liberals), but also expanding the role of the state in the Chinese economy (Maoists). Another topic in his speech was China's goal to become a formidable world power (nationalists). \n\nYou can also see this in China's relationship with the DPRK. The liberal faction sees the DPRK as an obstacle to opening up trade with the US, the nationalist faction sees the DPRK as an ally in the Korean peninsula but only insofar as they can project Chinese policy interests in the area (which makes them more liable to be upset when the WPK's leadership isn't compliant with Chinese policy interests), and the Maoist faction is interested in the DPRK for the same reasons that they were in the 1960s and 70s. The current situation is satisfactory to all factions: there is an enormous amount of trade with the DPRK, which aids the DPRK in modernisation and expanding its high-tech industry (Maoist faction), but when there is friction between that trade and UN embargoes, China dutifully complies with the request (liberal faction), which gives China increased leverage in making demands both on international stage (as the guarantor of peace in the Korean peninsula) and to the DPRK, because of their position as the DPRK's largest trading partner (nationalist faction). Later, once international media attention turns away, trade expands - but in an area not covered by UN sanctions. For example, when the oil sanctions came into place, China's shipments of corn increased by 4,600% (corn can easily be processed into ethanol, a fuel that the DPRK can use instead of petroleum) - this again satisfies the Maoist faction.\n\nThe liberal faction was most powerful under Jiang Zemin's administration in the 1990s - during this era, China was on the course to full liberalization. With another decade, it would likely have gone the way of the USSR. The 1997 East Asian financial crisis, although it did not affect the Chinese economy to the same extent that it affected Japan, Korea, and Singapore - demonstrated to the Chinese leadership of the time that all market-based developmental models were fundamentally flawed, unstable, and temporary - and that increased marketisation could only produce similar outcomes. The early 2000s recession and the collapse of the Y2K bubble were only further evidence that the liberal faction would only produce ruin in the end - which is why Hu Jintao's administration, beginning in 2003, marked a shift toward the expansion and consolidation of SOEs.\n\nWhat really proved to be the death of the liberal faction was the Great Recession, which effectively killed all attempts at liberalizing the economy - it was a massive wake-up call for the CPC, and around that time, you started seeing Mao Zedong Thought courses made mandatory in universities, massive anti-corruption campaigns, and a revival of Maoism especially among young people. At the moment, we're seeing the new generation of Chinese leadership (who were alive during the Cultural Revolution) start to come into power, who will inevitably be more closely aligned with the Maoist faction.\n\nWhen the next recession comes, the CPC will be forced to either pivot very far to the left, or very far to the right. At the moment, my thinking is that a leftward shift is much more likely.\n\ne: clarified first paragraph","created_utc":1513824603,"score":52,"subreddit":"communism"}

Again, because I explained it very poorly in my original response, I'd just like to add that all of these factions are thoroughly Marxist-Leninist and committed to international communism but have differences in outlooks which roughly correspond to the categories I outlined. The Maoists emphasise the transformation of social and productive relations as essential for socialist construction, the liberals emphasise the development of productive forces as essential for socialist construction, and the nationalists emphasise the ability of China to project its interests internationally as essential for socialist construction. Socialist construction involves balancing ancillary goals like these, the different factions only place an emphasis on different ancillary goals.\n\n&gt;Do you think China should/will adopt a greater focus on internationalism, like funding rebels/revolutions, propaganda and the like?\n\nIf you look at it from the perspective of the current Chinese leadership, they're still haunted by the dissolution of the USSR and painfully aware that the USSR was much wealthier than China, but still managed to massively overextend itself when it came to bankrolling revolutions. They're also aware that funding a revolution is not something that provides immediate returns, and more often than not, it produces no results at all - in China's case, the results would be international condemnation and a wave of embargoes which would cripple their developmental strategy and set them back decades, if their operatives slipped up and revealed China's hand.\n\nAt the moment, China's strategy revolves around creating a multipolar world, which necessarily involves dethroning the United States as an uncontended, rampant superpower. [This article](http://www.invent-the-future.org/2013/07/chinas-global-strategy/) has a very good summary of that entire strategy.\n\n&gt;If the DPRK were to be attacked, do you think China would back them up?\n\nAbsolutely, this is covered by the Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid and Cooperation Friendship Treaty.","created_utc":1513840856,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

If tomorrow the DSA or Bernie Sanders were to declare themselves Marxist-Leninists and start waving red flags, they would become the heroes of the revisionist left. There is no such thing as \u201cmarket socialism\u201d. Such a concept has continuously been ridiculed and rejected by every single one of the 5 leading theorists of Marxism from Marx to Mao. Both Lenin and Stalin regarded state ownership of major industries as a **prerequisite** of socialist construction, and is not socialist by itself. China does not even meet that requirement since only about half of its economy (even less if we take into consideration state owned industries leased out to private companies) is state controlled. \u201cMao Zedong Thought\u201d and the image of Mao himself have become nothing but a ghost for the Chinese revisionists to raise to remind people that the state is \u201ctheir\u201d state and that they are the inheritors of Mao\u2019s legacy, even though Mao would surely be in the mountains fighting against the current Chinese revisionists if he were alive today.\n\nChina has had a capitalist restoration. It\u2019s long past time to accept that fact. The economy isn\u2019t socialist. The party and state organs are filled with bureaucrats and millionaires. The people are suffering under the yoke of foreign and domestic capital with no end in sight. Meanwhile China pursues imperialist expansion of capital in Africa and participates in sanctions against the DPRK.

{"author":"Raestagg","body":"A post I'd stumbled across, that I'd like to quote here, but before doing so, to be clear, this is not meant to be accusatory in the least, rather it's an understanding of the sentiments but a reminder to stay the course:\n\nIt's all too easy to despair in our dealings with the masses, and to have a knee-jerk reaction to their indoctrinated ignorance.  It's important to remember at times like these, and to be sure this is something I still struggle with, that we all develop our class consciousness unevenly, some faster than others. To that end, a couple quotes and and excerpt from on article speaking to that topic and related bits.\n\n\"Did you come out of the womb clutching a copy of the Communist Manifesto? No? Then don't judge other people for not being on the same level as you (yet). Consciousness develop[s] unevenly and there will always be sections of the class who are ahead of the rest. It is the job of those at the front to lead by example and raise the rest of the class to the same level of revolutionary consciousness, not to simply scorn them for not being there yet.\" - u/insurgentclass\n\n\"As for people who are politically backward, Communists should not slight or despise them, but should befriend them, unite with them, convince them and encourage them to go forward.\" - Mao; \u201cThe Role of the Chinese Communist Party in the National War\u201d (October 1938), Selected Works, Vol. II.\n\n\"There is a segment of left liberals and, increasingly, of self-identified communists who are instantly extremely hostile to people who inadvertently use oppressive language, or reveal unaddressed prejudice or chauvinism. These self-identified communists immediately assume the worst of intentions, treat sincere requests for clarification as a smokescreen for refusing to change or understand, and use a disproportionate, wildly counterproductive degree of hostility in all dealings with people with any backward ideas. For many of these people, in the past it was \u201ccheck your privilege! it\u2019s not my job to educate you!\u201d These days it is \u201cself crit now!\u201d* and apparently, for these self-declared communists, it is still not their job to patiently and tirelessly help the masses transform themselves to become communists.\n\nThese people are dogmatists and extremely mechanical. They do not believe in the transformability of human beings. They believe the only way something transforms is if the whole thing is attacked from the outside, or if a completely pure impulse arises within them to transform the rest. They do not believe in the Maoist method of summoning and persuading the more correct parts inside of someone to struggle against the less correct parts, thereby helping both parts transform. They do not assess the real world to determine how best to carry out struggle within it, and instead treat the real world like an oversimplified, black-and-white model in their heads, whipping whatever elements of reality don\u2019t conform.\n\nIn particular, in the past few months, I\u2019ve seen this behavior in the slew of new Facebook groups to emerge since Trump\u2019s election created a surge of interest in communism, heavily in, for instance, \u201csounds liberal but ok\u201d but also, as I speak, in the MLM Communism 101 group. The philosophy that insists that no backwards thinking must be allowed to exist for longer than a single moment in a communist Facebook group is not a communist philosophy. Either:\n\n(a) this aspiration to create what amount to safe spaces in all but name is sincerely seen as genuinely revolutionary, which makes the people putting this into practice not communists (who seek to organize in order to bring in and transform the broad masses) but infoshop-creating anarcho-liberals (who believe that somehow creating spaces where no one evers uses a specific list of words or claims to adhere to certain worldviews will cause the state to crumble somehow someday); or\n\n(b) the insistence on swiftly purging sections of the masses with backward ideas is understood as counterproductive to revolution but fun anyway, in which case those practicing it may in theory be supporters of communism, but primarily they are self-indulgent people using communism as an intellectual game for their own amusement.\" - jiminykrix, \"On the incoherence of ordering someone to \u201cself crit,\u201d the arrogance and hostility of mechanical materialists\"\n\n","created_utc":1513858926,"score":52,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"DisgruntlementSquid","body":"I entirely support this. While I have concerns about the status of legal frameworks and constitutional rights in China, it has done great things and the world needs its stabalising influence in both foreign policy and economic development.\n\nChina is currently one of the last sane, global and humanitarian major powers in the world with a continual commitment to human development both at home and abroad. It responds slowly to issues, but when it does, it responds firmly.  It is essentially Chinese government policy which has caused the enormous drop in prices for renewable energy as part of a commitment to cleaning up the environment.\n\nWhen I see the state of major global powers entering into populist, racist right wing imperialist mentalities, Turkey, India, USA, Russia, various European governments, right wing factional takeovers in south America, China has become a flame of hope more than ever, despite its numerous setbacks.  It even has a stated goal for achieving its own form of socialism (around 2030 I believe), and has trialed out various local government self administration and direct - non party democracy, while giving us the biggest increase in human development in human history. Regardless of its many faults, it is an incredible success story for humanity.\n\nThe more I have learned from the (limited) resources about Chinese domestic and international policy, the more impressed I have become and the more I would implore others to see it as a cause for hope for the future. \n\nA recent example is watching an interview from Greece's ex Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis (who I'd recommend following from a Marxist perspective, simply because of his very strong understanding of the capitalist system and those who operate it, regardless of some of his liberal sensibilities). He spoke of negotiating the privatisation of the Greek port industries to Chinese companies in exchange for - guarenteed union organisation and worker representation rights - wage protection and increases and various other workers rights, profit sharing and so on. The Chinese negotiators were happy to offer this as a way to secure and increase the development of the Greek economy while developing its own economic connections. He said the Chinese negotiators were the most forward thinking and rational in terms of future investments and human welfare - predictably this was blocked by EU apparatchics who felt that only Greece's 'creditors' should be allowed to negotiate their privatisation deals. However, China has entered similar negotiations with developing countries, and sees the stable development of the world around it as part of its own stable development. We need this now more than ever.\n\nA last point I will make - Marx spoke about the potential liberating capacity that capitalism allows us through the sheer forceful development of productive forces which occurs through its investments. As OP has rightly stated, because of China's ownership of the majority of its businesses (or is a majority shareholder), it can at any time legally take away from the capitalists as it desires. It also owns 100% of all land within China - you can only lease it from the government for a maximum of 70 years.  When we say we are communists, it's because we AIM for communism. We still need to buy food from shops or we starve - we have material reality to contend with, and Marx's criticism of idealism is very useful because it allows us to work with what we have - global capitalism, rather than simply wishing for better things and complaining when they don't happen. The communist party in China has a purpose and aims despite its internal wrangling. Allowing capitalists to develop their economy is one way to swiftly develop its forces as OP has stated. Being economically isolated is terrible and is why the US loves embargoing other countries who don't do as they're told, particularly communist ones. We should never criticise a country for trading in a global capitalist economy just because we want to see it end.\n\nA lot of this information is rusty and needs clarification so I wouldn't go quoting it as fact - but I would strongly recommend comrades research chinese policy and actions and form informed opinions based on human development, stated aims and achievements rather than liberal sniping or leftier than thou abstract criticisms.

{"author":"intlnews","body":"&gt; The resignation of Robert Mugabe is changing the social landscape not only for the people of Zimbabwe but for all of Africa. This development is part and parcel of the ongoing struggle for independence and sovereignty against imperialism.\n\nNo doubt, the counter-revolution in Zimbabwe should be put into further context without a doubt as the current government seems willing to work with the West as they are part of the imperialist faction of the Zanu-PF.\n\n&gt; In the case of Zimbabwe, it was Cecil Rhodes who became the British colonizer of what was called Rhodesia in the late 1800s. Rhodes established the DeBeers Mining Company, known for its stolen diamonds from Zimbabwe. He treated the entire country as his private slave plantation with the backing of state brutality.\n\nNo doubt. Cecil Rhodes was symbolic and part and parcel of British imperialism. It was racist and undeniably brutal.\n\n&gt; By 1914, white settlers, numbering just 23,730, owned slightly more than 19 million acres of land in Rhodesia while an estimated 752,000 Africans occupied a total of 21,390,080 acres of land. \n\nThis is why land is so important in Zimbabwe today.\n\n&gt;,Ian Smith was proclaimed prime minister of Rhodesia in 1964 and confiscated 6,000 acres for himself. His apartheid policies codified white farmers\u2019 use of the land for commercial farming of crops like tobacco to be sold as commodities on the world capitalist market. So while these farmers were enriching themselves, the people of Zimbabwe faced starvation and were reduced to being \u201ctenants\u201d on their own lands.\n\nIan Smith was a greedy horrible person. Hopefully the new government doesn't bring back some of this again.\n\n&gt; Carrying forth the legacy of the first two phases of the liberation struggle, the Third Chimurenga (liberation struggle) created two fronts which arose in the late 1960s \u2014 one was ZANU (Zimbabwe African National Union) led by Mugabe and the other was ZAPU (Zimbabwe African People Union) led by Joshua Nkomo. These two guerrilla factions joined forces as the Patriotic Front to force the Smith government to the negotiating table in Britain and to sign the 1980 Lancaster House Accords, which was a compromise that supposedly held the British government accountable for financially compensating white farmers so that Black farmers could reclaim their lands.\n\nWhat I remember from what I've learned, ZAPU was pro-Soviet and ZANU was pro-China. Unfortunately the accords led to neocolonialism.\n\n&gt; A large sector of those who fought for the liberation of Zimbabwe were landless Black farmers, now commonly referred to as war veterans from the liberation struggle. Twenty years later, these same war veterans pressured the Mugabe government to remove the commercial farmers, by force if necessary, once the British government reneged on the Lancaster accord.\n\nAnd the latter happened which is great for Zimbabweans.\n\n&gt; Mugabe established a radical land redistribution program, allowing war veterans to take back their stolen lands, including by force. This included Ian Smith\u2019s acres.\n\nThat was great for the Zimbabwean people without a doubt. \n\n&gt; When Mugabe was re-elected as president during his 37-year tenure, both Blair and Bush declared the elections undemocratic, while attempting to prop up their puppet candidate. When a devastating drought hit Zimbabwe and other parts of southern Africa very hard in 2003, the imperialists blamed Mugabe for it.\n\nExactly. The imperialists wanted to discredit Zimbabwe and bring in someone more business-friendly.\n\n&gt; Today, Zimbabwe\u2019s foreign debt is more than $7 billion, more than half of its gross domestic product. According to a July 7 Reuters report, \u201cThe suggested reforms include slashing public sector wages, now at more than 90 percent of the national budget, reducing farm subsidies, improving transparency in the mining sector and reaching an agreement on the compensation of white farmers.\u201d\n\nThat's really bad! That means the Zimbabwean proletariat will suffer.\n\n&gt; Why have U.S. and British imperialism hated Mugabe since he became the first democratically elected president of Zimbabwe? Why are they glad he was forced to resign?\n\nThey feel they can get what they want with him gone.\n\n&gt; Mugabe is a bourgeois nationalist, not a socialist. There are two fundamental reasons why the imperialists hate him so much. Number one is that Mugabe is a former leader of a national liberation movement...he backed the war veterans taking back their land from the white colonizers and was unapologetic about doing so.\n\nThey hate him with a seering passion.\n\n&gt; ....defending Zimbabwe\u2019s leadership against imperialist intervention both economically and politically...Zimbabwe has a right to develop its economic infrastructure to meet the needs of the people, and not to have its economy chained to foreign debt...Zimbabwe has the capacity to feed its population if it weren\u2019t forced to export food to pay off the interest on its foreign debt. Cancel the debt!..we know that U.S. and British imperialism will not stop their intervention into the internal affairs of Zimbabwe...The biggest threat to the African continent today is the U.S. Africa Command, more commonly known as AFRICOM...Three of its bases are in Zambia, South Africa and Botswana, countries that border Zimbabwe.\n\nI feel Zimbabwe is in a bad way and I am deeply concerned at its future trajectory.

The present danger to the people of the world is not China, it is the U.S., the U.S. is the present enemy of all the people. South Korea, Canada, Israel, and so forth - these are secondary enemies. These are mainly allies to the U.S. but also, at the same time, are competing with the U.S. for global imperial domination. Russia and China, you could say these are near the end of the list as enemies. They seek to also become global economic powerhouses and large imperial-powers, but while doing so resist a true, full-on, strategic alliance with the U.S., while also economically collaborating with the U.S.\n\nMy assessment may be completely wrong and confusing, but it all boils down to China being a capitalist-imperialist country, void of socialism (or even so-called 'market-socialism') and China being a country out to compete with the U.S. and other imperialist nations for global influence.\n\nChina is attempting to outcompete fellow imperialist rivals while also keeping to economic relations to the countries and they are currently successful at it.","created_utc":1514002203,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Too often, socialists (especially in the West) are quick to dismiss and criticize socialist countries without a thorough investigation. When we make criticisms, we must do so through rigorous study, not hand-waving and sweeping condemnations.\n\nSecond of all, I think we should emphasize the successes when we talk about 20th century socialist experiments. When we try to organize workers today, I think it is much more compelling to say \"look at all these things socialism achieved in the 20th century\" rather than dismiss them out of hand and say \"well that wasn't *real* socialism,\" because then people will think we're ridiculous for trying again if it has failed every time in the past.\n\nLastly, I think it is very important to study the mistakes and shortcomings of 20th century socialism, and to do so in a way that probes deeper than a simple, cartoonish narrative of 'revisionism' worming its way into the Party. Study the problems of organizing production, planning an economy, overcoming underdevelopment, the shadow economy in the USSR, right-opportunism and ultra-leftism in the Party, foreign policy blunders, etc.\n\nUnderstanding the problems of 20th century socialism will help us build a stronger socialism in the 21st. And when we praise the 20th century efforts, we have to remember that we aren't out here to recreate the USSR under Stalin or the PRC under Mao. We live in very different conditions, especially those of us in the imperialist countries.

{"author":"intlnews","body":"I guess I'm not the only one trying to follow this closely. \n\n&gt; Undoing the historic land reform initiated by ZANU-PF in 2000, Zimbabwe\u2019s new administration, under the leadership of Emmerson Mnangagwa, has returned seized land to the the first white farmer in a process he hopes will restore Zimbabwe\u2019s agricultural success. Robert Smart and his son Darryn returned to their former farm about 200 kilometers east of Harare, where they were greeted by supporters from the community. As an individual, many there had remembered Smart as having cooperated with the land reform and sheltered guerrillas during the war. From their descriptions, one may be tempted to ask why this reversal is such a bad thing if he is an ostensibly noble individual. It is not about the individual. Sure, Robert Smart may have contributed to Zimbabwe\u2019s future by helping to bury Rhodesia, assuming what has been said is true, but we cannot reduce a structural problem to the character of a single individual. His historical relationship to ZANU-PF now serves only as propaganda for the general push by Mnangagwa to empower and reintegrate white farmers into the agricultural system.\n\nExactly. Mnangagwa promised he would return seized land to White farmers in his inaugural address and he is following through with in a fury. Soon enough the country will be filled with Western capitalist vipers. It does not look good.\n\n&gt; In the light of Mnangagwa\u2019s decision, the Commercial Farmers Union (CFU), which stands for the interests of white farmers and the return of \u201ctheir\u201d lands, has expressed a deep sense of optimism, and have moved to meet with ministers involved in implementing new agricultural reforms. The CFU is not merely a collection of individuals, but is an institution with specific class-national interests and objectives acting as a political base for colonial reaction. It is no mistake that they\u2019ve found common cause with the neoliberal leadership in the new government who are now hard at work, undoing all progressive policies of the post-colonial Zimbabwean government. In its place they are building a thoroughly neocolonial Zimbabwe, and comprador bourgeois forces are working hand-in-glove with all the forces of colonial reaction to restore a de-facto white minority rule, emanating from neoliberal trade agreements with europe and their empowered white allies in the country.\n\nNo doubt. The CFU seems to be at odds with Zimbabwe's major trade union which is part of the discredited opposition (as it currently stands) but seems to oppose the government's policies. With all this, the ranks of the opposition may very well change to be more democratic and actually reflect the interests of the populace.\n\n&gt; But how did it get to this point? It did not begin with Mnangagwa\u2019s coup. The roots for such a reaction are quite old, and have their history in the crumbling periphery of Mugabe\u2019s administration. After all, Mnangagwa and his cohorts have all been in power, serving as central figures in the ruling party for decades. The disintegration of the socialist bloc and the subsequent corrosion of political leadership within the ZANU-PF has created the current political climate. The struggle between neocolonialists and anti-imperialists in the party and state has been played out in the battle for strategic positions, new economic reforms and a hopeful integration into the world economy. Mnangagwa and his advisers were not on the sidelines in these affairs, they were central to the party\u2019s policy-making apparatus, advocating for stronger programs of liberalization and repairing economic connections to europe. Their justifications were always the same: it is unavoidable in revitalizing the Zimbabwean economy.\n\nIts true they have been in power for some time. However, Mugabe and those who wanted to pursue a Black nationalist (or even bourgeois nationalist) policy to benefit the Black masses held the upper hand for some time until they got edged out in one final blow with this coup.\n\n&gt; The roots of neocolonial and neoliberal reaction are found in the opportunism of state forces when it comes to the political questions of colonialism and imperialism. To Mnangagwa and his allies, \u201cprosperity\u201d is the only question and it is the direction of \u201cpetty politics\u201d that has stifled its development. Seeing the decline of the Zimbabwean economy and agriculture with the deliberate pursuit of land reform, and the international sanctions which have been imposed as a result, the neoliberal bloc has sought to place production in absolute command over politics. Whereas the national bourgeoisie saw political objectives outside the realm of production, whose policies often had adverse economic impacts, the compradors have moved to undo their \u201cmistakes\u201d and set the country on a path to a so-called recovery. While this provides a clear path to \u201cprosperity\u201d in the world economy, opening up many avenues for development and the enrichment of the bourgeois class, it strengthens the underlying machinery of colonial restoration, and has made those like Mnangagwa fast friends of reactionary white-power institutions like the CFU.\n\nExactly. He is willing to work with reactionary institutions and have \"better\" ties with the West, which will lead to the further exploitation of the Zimbabwean proletariat.\n\n&gt; Meanwhile, for the Zimbabwean proletariat and peasantry, their losses are being solidified by the coup government, which has so far only succeeded in codifying the changes which were already practically in the works for over a decade. The class-national struggle in Zimbabwe had been proceeding through the years of decaying power under Mugabe, and many losses had already been suffered. Even the land reform, which had given land to so many landless farmers, was pursued half-heartedly and ended in the reconsolidation of land in unusused, large private tracts. The victory of the neocolonialists was dependent, in part, on the failure to electrify the country in its opposition to the slow hegemonic struggle for control of the state that was being waged. Now, with their rule firmly in place and the last of the obstacles to full integration with the imperialist world economy gone, the partnership of white farmers and neocolonialists will accelerate the robbery of political influence and power by the imperialists.\n\nIt definitely will. I fear that Zimbabwe has gone down a path of no return, a path in which they will be swallowed by the vultures.\n\n&gt; The leadership of the national bourgeoisie has failed, and its confused economic program is responsible for preparing the groundwork for neocolonial reaction in the party and state. This great betrayal should not be forgotten, and we should all learn from the process of decay that we have witnessed in the Zimbabwean state preceding its ultimate backslide into neocolonial capitalism. The neocolonialists have stated that this is the only path to \u201cprosperity\u201d but we must ask who that prosperity is for. Certainly it is not for the broad masses, who now are seeing all political gains earned over the past decades evaporating before their eyes. Production in command of politics, in the era of imperialism, demands the supremacy of the imperialists, and enforces neocolonialism.\n\nPerhaps they did fail, but there is no doubt that the current government will implement harsh neocolonialism which will cause untold suffering. That is something all of us should oppose without question. Before you know it, the U$ will have a military base in the country and it will have joined Africom.\n\n&gt; The only way to combat this is to put politics back in command of production. Real electrification must now take place to defend and advance the gains of the land reform, and politically justify all economic decisions. Given the historic failure of the national bourgeoisie to deliver the country from imperialism, the commanding political structures must be rooted in the Zimbabwean masses, particularly the proletariat and peasantry, which suffer the most under the despotic rule of the imperialists. Although it should root itself in the concrete political gains of the Mugabe era, the movement to destroy neocolonialism in Zimbabwe must be able to extend beyond its limitations. Real social revolution must replace superficial anti-colonialism if they are to repel the neocolonial tide, and reverse the many defeats they have been dealt.\n\nExactly, Zimbabwe needs a genuine social revolution, something which can fully benefit the masses. I wish them the best of luck.","created_utc":1514051739,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

Ruthless criticism of all that exists makes sense within the entirety of Marx's thought but in isolation turns into liberalism because for Marx changing the world is how knowledge is produced at all. More crudely, people rarely criticize themselves without party discipline to give them a sense of purpose and therefore don't even properly apply the concept.\n\nDoes the legacy of Kublai Khan matter to you? Does the Mongolian government's celebration of him cause you to become confused or think they are genocide deniers? No, nobody cares. The only reason you have an opinion about communist history is because you're a communist and want to create communism. The first principle then should be *how does my understanding of the Soviet Union impact my actual politics towards communism?* Truth matters of course but your knowledge or ignorance of it is as important as any other member of the 7 billion human beings on earth, most of whom do not suffer the delusion that they have a social media audience or even access to \"independent\" sources on the internet. Truth should help you be a communist and being a communist means creating communism in a way where there is actual progress and results. Do you think the party line of the CPP bothers a peasant in Mindanao? Do you think they post on reddit asking for \"unbiased sources?\" No, the truth of the line is confirmed by the impact it has on their lives. Their understanding of Stalin is far in advance of yours because it is developed through praxis. Anti-revisionism is true because it is the only ideology based on a historical understanding that leads revolutionary movements today. Don't let our enemies take that from you and pretend they are on equal footing when it comes to truth: by Marx's own words they are useless. But you also can't just take credit for other people's accomplishments, your own praxis is primary (meaning the praxis of your class, it's likely that your praxis is absolute anti-imperialism and defense of communism past and present so that the proletarian vanguard on the Philippines cam develop a scientific understanding with less interference from first world liberal \"socialists\" muddying the waters).\n\nThe idea that you don't know everything and history should be informed by praxis used to be obvious to those who followed democratic centralism. This has been lost and the internet has created a generation of petty-bourgeois isolated people who believe they are in-themselves a party because social media and the education system gives the illusion of \"influence.\" Regain democratic centralism because the latter impulse inevitably runs into the double limitation of developing knowledge without praxis and the limits of a single individual with very little real training in research, causing the kind of anxiety you're feeling. That always leads to liberalism because if you want to know something but can't the dominant ideology will always do the work for you and fill in the gaps. Unless you are actually Grover Furr and your knowledge does have some impact, in which case what Grover Furr does is exactly right (most people simultaneously want to know everything and refuse to read books so memes become knowledge which is what's happened to him, what Furr actually does is criticize the state of scholarship and rarely puts forward opinions of his own)","created_utc":1514060531,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

Land reform, for instance, was pursued as a private endeavor, which lead to the re-consolidation and abandonment of many farms. The response, due to the fact that profit and \"prosperity\" was a cherished motivation in the bourgeois state, was the intensification of the contradiction between the present neoliberal faction (whose interests were in part guarded and advanced by the bourgeois state) and the nationalist politics-in-command of Robert Mugabe's faction. The pull toward successful market liberalization on one end and nationalist economic policies on the other created an asymmetric tension. Unfortunately, few really saw the danger in what was going on until it was too late. Rather than suppressing the neoliberal faction, their economic policy needed them, so they were allowed to grow relatively unimpeded for more than two decades. That is, of course, not to blame Mugabe for the current situation (not entirely, anyways) but it is just to demonstrate the shortcomings of this kind of confused economic program of the national bourgeois post-independence.

There were also other extremely successful literary programs in other countries like Allende's chile, but what I am trying to say is that socialist countries do a really good job at eliminating illiteracy, so I wouldn't chalk up Sankara's achievements to incorrect statistics too easily\n\nSources:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Literacy_Campaign\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likbez\n\n\nhttps://www.google.ca/amp/www.telesurtv.net/english/amp/english/analysis/10-Things-to-Know-About-Revolutionary-Cubas-Literacy-Program-20160908-0007.html\n","created_utc":1514104439,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"WikiTextBot","body":"**Cuban Literacy Campaign**\n\nThe Cuban Literacy Campaign (Spanish: Campa\u00f1a Nacional de Alfabetizaci\u00f3n en Cuba) was a year-long effort to abolish illiteracy in Cuba after the Cuban Revolution. It began on January 1 and ended on December 22, 1961, becoming the world's most ambitious and organized literacy campaign.\n\nBefore 1959 the official literacy rate for Cuba was between 60% and 76%, largely because of lack of education access in rural areas and a lack of instructors. As a result, the Cuban government of Fidel Castro at Che Guevara's behest dubbed 1961 the \"year of education\" and sent \"literacy brigades\" out into the countryside to construct schools, train new educators, and teach the predominantly illiterate guajiros (peasants) to read and write.\n\n***\n\n**Likbez**\n\nLikbez (Russian: \u043b\u0438\u043a\u0431\u0435\u0301\u0437, Russian pronunciation: [l\u02b2\u026a\u0261\u02c8b\u02b2\u025bs]; from a Russian abbreviation for \"likvidatsiya bezgramotnosti\", \u043b\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0301\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0431\u0435\u0437\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0301\u043c\u043e\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438, [l\u02b2\u026akv\u02b2\u026a\u02c8dats\u0268j\u0259 b\u02b2\u026az\u02c8\u0261ram\u0259tn\u0259s\u02b2t\u02b2\u026a], meaning \"elimination of illiteracy\") was a campaign of eradication of illiteracy in Soviet Russia and Soviet Union in the 1920s and 1930s.

{"author":"ImNotMarshalZhukov","body":"Absolutely. Each one of these conflicts was provoked in part or entirely by american imperialism. Imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism, as Lenin so eloquently put it. Economic colonialism is the stage in capitalist development under which corporations begin to seek profit overseas by exploiting foreign resources and labour. This is massively profitable, (think how much money apple makes paying factory workers in Shanghai 1.60$ per hour and selling you a 1000$ Iphone, or how much money debeers makes when they sell you a 3000$ diamond that they pay congolese miners less than 1$ a day to mine), and when a system or a group of people threaten that neocolonial system, capitalists (and the governments they control) tend to lash out very violently to protect their interests. A great example of this is operation condor, when the United States funded and supported six right wing dictatorships in their genocide of suspected leftists. Most notably was Augusto Pinochets' chile, arguably the worst dictatorship in modern latin-american history. killing more than 40,000 people in less than a decade. Not to mention the times when america got directly involved in wars like Korea (where carpet bombings killed 20% of the north korean population) or Vietnam (where napalm strikes and chemical bombings resulted in over 2 million dead vietnamese civilians). These wars were not results of American error, or defending other innocent countries. They were part of a global-capitalist system that is willing to do whatever it takes to maintain the status quo, up to and including genocide.","created_utc":1514113374,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

The one thing I think should be highlighted more is the kind of \"tasks of the revolution\" as set by the Communist Party of Venezuela and other proletarian segments within and without the PSUV. I think they have a very good conception of the hegemonic struggle against the bourgeois class and are really winning the cultural and political war for state territory, the next step is to really force their way into the economy. I think it's a promising situation, especially since even the highest echelons of the PSUV still identify that parasitic capitalism dominates the economic system, and is still omnipresent in the country, needing to be rooted out. This is good precisely because they have positioned themselves as a lever of class struggle. The petty bourgeois elements of the PSUV have been somewhat discredited in the recent months as it is clear that there is no need to cross the aisle and appeal to the opposition for the sake of government unity. I know that a year ago they were even considering ousting the PCV from the coalition and cracking down on other proletarian elements, but this faction has been, for the moment, defeated as they have demonstrated that it is the proletarian elements which are the closest allies to the revolution. Opportunists must still be rooted out, and eventually there will need to be a qualitative break between the petty bourgeois social democrats and proletarian socialists in the Bolivarian movement, but so far the proletariat seems to have the wind to their backs approaching this critical struggle.

{"author":"ImNotMarshalZhukov","body":"A quick preface: yes, the global capitalist system happens to be global and capitalist. I am not sure how this makes me a statist. \n\n1:The state in a capitalist system is controlled by corporate power. whether it be through lobbying or direct fascism, the modern Capitalist state and the capitalist system are inseparable. Furthermore, Imperialism is economic exploitation of the resources and labour of a foreign country. In the past it was usually through much more direct means, but today it still exists, has the same effects and in many ways is stronger than at any other point in human history. In the modern era, this is done by corporations.\n\n2:Corporations are the ones who wanted to pour \"investment\" into korea and vietnam. The fact is that these places had the opportunity to become extremely profitable. When that opportunity dried up due to national liberation movements, governments take action on behalf of their capitalist masters\n\n3: Yes, that isn't a good thing, especially considering almost all of the time someone gets screwed over.\n\n4: Pinochet was unarguably one of the worst dictators in latin american history, he plunged 45% of the nation into poverty, the country had two crippling recessions and tens of thousands of murders.\n\n5: This is wrong on both fronts. Firstly, american corporations had quite a few holdings in Vietnam, usually joint partnerships from when they were still a french colony. Korea only had been independant for 5 years, not enough time to build a true economic colony. Furthermore, if countries can undermine american hegemony that sets a dangerous precedent for other exploited nations. Right-wingers will often say that comparing the two Koreas is proof that capitalism is superior, but that is absolutely ridiculous for a few reasons. Firstly, south korea at the end of the korean war had twice the population, most of the resources and had the distinct advantage of not having 1/5 people massacred by U.S bombings. While south korea has received huge investment from the west, North Korea has been militarily and economically isolated. When a country has been spending 22% of its gdp annually on defence for 70 years it takes a toll on its economic growth. Despite this, until the 1970s north korea was actually more advanced than its southern counterpart. As for vietnam, it is the fastest growing economy of the big 13, and despite having millions of its citizens genocided by chemical weapons attacks and napalm bombings, it is relatively prosperous when compared with most other nations in the region. As for the notion that the United States fought those wars to \"save\" the people of those countries, to believe that you need to be very malevolent or oppressively stupid. The united states fights for its own interests, you admited it yourself when you said governments work for profit. They were working to protect their own interests and the interests of their corporate puppet masters. Besides, if the best way to \"save\" a population is to slaughter millions and leave a trail of death and devestation in your wake than I have been missing something.\n\n6: We've been over this. The EU is a capitalistic globalist enterprise run by capitalist globalists. The U.S does not pay for their defence, it pays for its defence. There is a reason the United States has military bases in 130 countries, and its to keep them in line, not to protect them. Saying that the americans are stupid enough to get roped into a deal where they pay for the \"defence\" of dozens of nations without getting something tangible back is laughable. Western nations are not leaning towards socialism, in fact it is the other way around. Right wing candidates have recently won very astounding victories in the political spheres of many western countries, namely Germany, Austria and the United States. Saying otherwise is denying fact. Africa and Latin america are almost entirely capitalist. There are 5 nominally socialist countries in the world, none of them are in africa, one is in latin america and three are in asia. Africa is perhaps the most accurate depiction of capitalism in its developed stage, an impoverished hellhole being exploited for hundreds of billions of dollars each year, being raped and exploited by multi-national corporations to make a buck. That is the true face of capitalism my friend, not how we in the west experience it, but how the majority of the world's population do. Capitalism is based on free trade between corporations, not people and not countries. who's controlling the system? thats easy, the fortune 500 companies doing the trading.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, but I had a lot to say","created_utc":1514142081,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"ComradeBarca","body":"Before you read, this is my opinion. You may in fact disagree with that opinion. To help alleviate your strong anger at my tomfoolery, I'd be happy to discuss further.\n\nNationalism\n\nOne problem that did a large part in killing off the USSR and SFR Yugoslavia governments was nationalism. Despite efforts to provide egalitarianism to all the peoples of each state, many ethnicities within these two states felt that their influence within their respective countries was drowned out by the majority (USSR - Russians, Yugoslavia - Serbs). What's more troubling is that these occured despite federalization in the case of Communist Yugoslavia. This might be dealt with by giving greater autonomy to the peoples of these nations or independence (they need home rule). This can also be seen in the modern day PRC. Despite the numerous ethnicities within the PRC, the Chinese dominate the governing bodies.\n\nA History of Totalitarianism\n\nAnother problem has to be the totalitarian aspect that Communism CAN have. The entire idea behind communism and socialism was to overthrow the rich owners of the means of production and to distribute this to the workers. Totalitarianism surrendering a large degree of proletarian autonomy to the state in the form of nationalized industries. Personally, some industries should be nationalized for the common good like electricity, water, and food (perhaps even the internet itself). However, clothing industries (debatable) should not be an executive concern or toy factories for that matter. It simply isn't important for the governing body of any society to waste resources on. Soviet Democracy sounds interesting.\n\nLack of Luxury Items for the Proletariot\n\nFinally, Socialist &amp; Communist societies should make a larger effort to raise the standard of living for their people. Before I begin to explain, I am talking about the resources in the home as opposed to things such as universal healthcare or universal public schooling. Both of these do improve the standard of living, but they do not allow the proletariot a large number of additional luxury items. I'd would have liked to have seen TV's mass produced and distributed to Soviet citizen's homes or computers for recreation at little to no cost to the Soviet people (likely done through a tax). Essentially, I'm talking about items that seem easy to come by in Bourgeois Republics that are harder to come by in Communist &amp; Socialist states.\n\n10/10 Would enjoy further discussion in the comments.","created_utc":1514167387,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"Shoot_Coward","body":"In the cases of a lot of small countries (such as Ethiopia, North Vietnam, Somalia, North Korea, Cuba etc.) they were not self-reliant, and that either caused the country to fail or to struggle for many years.  In some cases, such as North Korea, there just isn't enough arable land to grow enough food for 25 million people.  So you have a populace that can't feed itself, and then all it takes is some diplomatic sanctions and eventually it will crumble and fall.  Any population considering the revolution needs to have a solid agricultural plan from the beginning, a plan that can survive the diplomatic sanctions that we know will come.  With today's technology, which can produce more per hectare than ever before, the land could be leveraged to ease the struggle compared to our comrades 100 years ago.\n\n\nNow, as far as the Soviet Union, which many believe to be the closest we ever came, the problem with food existed, but what really got them was the Vanguard Party.  I know I may get a lot of hate for saying that, but I think if you look at it without any emotion, you'll find that the Vanguard Party allowed for a lot of abuse in the system.  Was it the reason the Soviet Union fell?  We will never know for sure, we can't go back and redo.  And at that time, without the technology of today it made a lot of sense for them to try it that way, paper ballots going to all the citizens every time a decision needed made just wouldn't have been practical then.  I firmly believe if Lenin was around today, he would eschew the Vanguard for a more direct approach that can be achieved with the technology of today.\n\n\nSo, in closing, it is technology that will help avoid a lot of the negative outcomes that have hurt us in the past.\n\n","created_utc":1514169076,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"ImNotMarshalZhukov","body":"Have you read the article? Its fundamentally flawed. For one thing, he states FAO data did not take into account inefficiencies in the system, that is a blatant falsehood. Anybody can read their methodology themselves and come to that same conclusion. Secondly, he cites Igor Birman constantly, who is not a reliable source. Igor may have been right in saying that the soviet military spending was much higher than predicted, and happened to by chance predict the collapse of the USSR, but most of his work is completely wrong. For one, the 1981 book he cited also states soviet consumption was 20% of american consumption (Read: this guy thought soviet citizens got 600 calories daily) and that living standards were 1/4 of those in the united states, which is both a non-falsifiable argument and by any logical conclusion absolutely false. Thirdly, the argument about minutes of work needed to buy something is not only totally false, but completely misleading. Firstly, he fails to take into account the social wage, which frees up massive amounts of income to spend on goods and services. Things like not needing to pay education, healthcare or childcare costs resulted in huge additional funds to be spent or saved. Secondly, the numbers he uses are outright false. He says that it took a soviet worker on average 78 minutes of work to buy 6kg of bread, which is absolutely false. Given the average soviet salary in 1979 was approximately 2.02 rubles per hour for a blue collar worker, and a loaf of premium quality bread (the equivalent of the artisanal stuff you would buy at your local whole-foods store) costed 0.25 rubles a loaf, and given their are 7.5 loaves of bread in 6kg, it would have taken an average **blue collar** worker 55 minutes (read: not 78) to earn 6 kg of bread. If he wanted the regular supermarket bread, which is what is implied in the article, it would have taken him 40 minutes to earn it. The point I'm trying to make is that the statistics he cited are absolutely bunk. I could debunk every statistic he used, as they all have similar problems, but overall I think you get the point. Another good example is when he cites a study from 1996, more than four years after the breakup of the USSR to try and prove nutrition was worse in soviet controlled areas.

Eight years\u2019 worth of wages would have been required to acquire all of this* **Note**: the average soviet salary in 1979 was anywhere from 4000-8000 rubles a year depending on your job) and last time i checked if you make 4000 a year it does not take you 8 years to make 1400 dollars, even if **each** of those cultural goods costed 400 rubles (which they didn't) it would still only take a blue collar worker a little over a year to earn enough to pay for all of them.","created_utc":1514179594,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"HysniKapo","body":"Stalin was in office for a long time and many momentous processes occurred under him (collectivization, industrialization, the Great Patriotic War, etc.)\n\nThere were cases where \"brutality\" was simply class struggle, such as the fight against kulaks. That is the sort of \"brutality\" of revolutionaries like Lenin or Robespierre. In the course of collectivizing agriculture there were excesses, and Stalin shared some of the blame, but anti-communists are not interested in this, they want to tar the whole period of collectivization by focusing on individual cases where non-kulaks were labeled as kulaks, etc.\n\nIn other cases, like the Yezhovschina, many honest communists ended up tortured and killed due to fears of fascist espionage and sabotage as Europe moved ever closer toward war. Obviously one can criticize Stalin's role in that regard.\n\nThe Soviets themselves after 1956 upheld Stalin as a great revolutionary despite his negative attributes, as one can see in the 1970s _[Great Soviet Encyclopedia](https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Stalin%2c+Josef+Vissarionovich)_ article on him. I think that is how he ought to be evaluated, just like the Communist Party of China upholds Mao as a great revolutionary while acknowledging his shortcomings.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about Stalin, feel free to ask.","created_utc":1514219147,"score":9,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"This is basically slave morality. Every tendency which has been expelled from the national communist parties descended from the comintern has formed its own party. Why not create a party which allows tendencies? Why have these parties, presumably founded because the communist party was so wrong on an issue that a new party needed to be formed, not done anything ever? Why did the one example he brought up turn into a force of reaction in Poland?\n\nThis actually comes up a lot here. If the CCP is so reactionary, why not create a revolutionary Maoist party in China? In reality, people who complain about Stalinist deviation or even Eurocommunism want the success and legitimacy of those parties without having to do the work. Or more accurately, they represent exactly what Stalin diagnosed: a petty-bourgeois element disconnected from the masses jockeying for leadership of the working class. Anything about democracy or the workers is window dressing, if they actually represented that they would have no problem luring that class away from the reactionary and elitist communist parties. Trotskyism didn't survive the death of Trotsky though the collapse of the USSR was the final death knell. In the end these forces didn't even bother to form a new \"official\" communist party when the USSR and its allied parties collapsed, from what I can tell Balibar doesn't even consider himself a Marxist-Leninist anymore (same with Badiou and so the other French intellectuals of the era) and has retreated into academic obscurism (so much for democracy!).\n\nThis is not a matter of correctness through popularity, in fact many parties followed the exact path Balibar wants, the communist party of the Philippines being the most notable because it survived the collapse of the revisionist Soviet aligned party. But that party then reaffirmed the basic correctness of Lenin and Stalin on the issue, the fantasies about what they should do from intellectuals be damned. On the other hand, could the USSR have been saved if a revolutionary party had existed which could seize power from the forces of reaction? I find that hard to believe and ultimately think that kind of fantasy about the primacy of the political is idealism (though its seed can be found in both Lenin and Mao, ultimately I think the solution is that the problems a socialist country face and a socialist party making revolution are not the same as Balibar is trying to argue). In the end, democratic centralism seems to reappear no matter the ideology involved or the time and place (the purging of the Sanders faction and the humbling of Trump and Bannon should reveal how the bourgeois tolerate dissent, even within the framework of liberalism, looks like when it matters). I would even go so far as to say that democratic centralism is the most democratic form, Trotskyists organizations are even more undemocratic than the parties they criticized and anarchist organizations that criticize them are even more undemocratic than that (all you needed to do was spend some time at occupy to see what real unaccountable leadership and complete separation between the intellectual class and the masses looks like). The time to return to Luxemburg and other ghosts of the past is over, our goal today is to recover the power the \"Stalinist deviation\" parties once had. Then we can create a new generation of hanger ons when it is again profitable for petty-bourgeois intellectuals to call themselves communists. The former communists of the past who've decided only they know the future, and it happens to be a complete break with the past and Marxism-Leninism so buy my book, don't interest me at all.\n\nE: Althusser ultimately remained in the party, at least when he was most productive, because that was the only way to maintain a connection with the working class. He was an excellent critic of their tactics and ideology but he never really asked why that was the case except to speculate they retained the legitimacy of the Bolshevik revolution and resistance to the Nazis. That's not really an answer, or at least it doesn't give us a theoretical concept to work with. And it doesn't satisfy us today when all that theory led to nothing and all this fantasizing about the \"communist hypothesis\" and some future \"Event\" leads to nothing but capitulation to capitalism and bourgeois hegemony, the kind which would never have been possible when communism still existed. We need a positive theory and nothing has ever shown itself to be superior to Marxism-Leninism; in the mean time new theory within Marxism-Leninism, from the CPP and CPI(M) but also the Cuban Communist Party, the Worker's Party of Korea, and the KKE is far more productive and tied to the working class than any of the junk coming out of academia.","created_utc":1514314861,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

What does she think about feminism (or the LBGTQ community)? Has she ever heard anyone talk about feminism and the ideas behind it? Wage gap between genders? Sexual harassment in the workplace? If it is at all important to her then she will hopefully come around to the thought that all aspects of equality are important and equally (lol) worth fighting for. Capitalism requires inequality and rewards furthering inequality in as many ways as possible. Does she fall within any other groups that have been labeled and discriminated against, even if it's just that they lack the social privilege of a white cisgender male?\n\nAsk her if she gets or would get uncomfortable if/when a homeless person approaches her in the street asking for change. Why does it make her feel that way? Does she feel hatred towards that person? Does she wish they would just leave her alone because she doesn't want to smell that god awful stench any more? Why? If she says she doesn't care about anyone else but herself or any group that is a subset of humanity then ask her why she thinks she lacks the empathy that would allow her to do that. Capitalism ridiculously inflates self-importance and drowns out most people's ability to be empathetic towards others because everything has a market value, and if you as a person even wanted to help someone else out it would be a direct detriment to yourself. Does she want to live in a society where the vast majority of people aren't free to help other people whenever they want, and we are forced to think about it in terms of whenever we *can* help other people?\n\n\"each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own\" - John Koenig. Our consciousness is already centered around ourselves so combine that with how capitalism amplifies self-importance and it makes it seem impossible that people would be able to have the thought that even if they are the star of their own movie that doesn't make everyone else in the world just an extra.\n\nOn top of all of that there is also the human nature argument. Human nature has dictated that she adapt to capitalism because she lives within it. Her thoughts and feelings about humanity are a product of her adaptation to it under capitalism. On top of that she has the media to tell her that inequality is ok. Then you could get into control: \"The perfect prison is one in which those incarcerated are excited to be there.\" I could go on and on and on, I'm sure....\n\nEdit/Disclaimer: I don't condone charities, they are a fleeting and clearly unsustainable afterthought of a solution to the world's problems.

{"author":"DIOS_INJUSTO","body":"Why not just read the document?  It's not long.  Anyway, here are the main points.  All quotes are from the document.\n\n- RGA tails antifa style tactics while claiming them as the primary form of struggle.\n\n&gt;Instead of engaging in a concrete analysis of the situation in the U.S., and working to understand it in relation to past historical struggles in the ICM, RGA reduces the situation to a non-dialectical opposition between fascism and revolution. This metaphysical dualism is a negation of MLM and the dialectical materialist world outlook. Revisionists who put forward this sort of reductionist analysis justify it because of their supposed expert insight into a particular situation, and in doing so negate the importance of joining the masses in their daily struggles.\n\n- RGA takes a reductionist position when defining who the masses are.\n\n&gt;In Condemned to Win, RGA describes the masses as \u201cthose without.\u201d This reductionist understanding of the masses as undifferentiated have-nots ignores the actual contradictions that exist among the people. MLM shows the basis to overcome contradictions rather than to pave over them. Rather than speaking of the masses as \u201cthose without,\u201d revolutionaries see the basis to unite the masses in the struggle against exploitation and oppression. Despite the fact that the masses come from various backgrounds and are subject to distinct forms of oppression, they have a shared material interest in overthrowing those who oppress and exploit them.\n\n- RGA takes the position that armed struggle and violence is the primary expression of proletarian political struggle (aka Gonzaloism).\n\n&gt; In their statements, RGA equates liberalism with reluctance towards violence, positioning themselves as free from liberalism because of their supposed seriousness about physical combat. Instead of meaningful analysis of the development of class forces in a given situation, RGA resorts to posturing, bravado, and machismo. Doing so is not helpful. It is a serious form of liberalism.\n\n&gt;Given RGA\u2019s commitment to eclecticism, it takes some work to discern what the section in their position paper Condemned to Win titled \u201cArmed Struggle and Violence as the Primary Form of Expression\u201d is really trying to say. But after a thorough reading of their drawn-out and scattered ruminations, the content can be discerned: that the primary form taken by the political struggle of the proletariat at all times is armed struggle and violence.\n\n- RGA practices a form of commandism where only those educated to their standards can rightfully criticize the organization.\n\n&gt;Calling-out abuse and abusers, as well as articulating even partially-formed criticisms against potentially wrong ideas and approaches is essential to this process, especially among the masses and emerging activists. RGA instead discourages any and all criticism until one has a \u201cgood understanding of the dialectical relationship between theory and practice.\u201d This is the bourgeois view of politics in which only the ideas of anointed \u201cexperts\u201d matter, and no one else has the right to speak or question these so-called experts. In RGA\u2019s view their supposedly superior practice justifies a commandist approach to politics and gives them immunity from criticism. Their view is non-dialectical. Those who have spent time in \u201ccollectives\u201d where patriarchy and individualism reigns supreme will be familiar with RGA\u2019s effectively hollow and pernicious claim that their \u201cpolitics of the deed\u201d supposedly justifies all. \n\n- RGA supports imperialist lackeys, the YPG.\n\n&gt;In the case of its support for the YPG cited above, RGA could not be bothered to condemn U.S. intervention in the region at all. In contrast, revolutionaries must find creative ways to advance the cause of the people through understanding the lessons of past revolutionary struggle, and applying them to their particular situation.\n\n- RGA are opportunists (a \"race to the finish\" approach to politics)\n\n&gt;Their aforementioned endorsement of a focoist line as opposed to a mass-line, their attempts to wreck emerging Maoist collectives, their class-negationist conceptions of the masses as \u201cthose without\u201d, their rejection of external criticism of male-chauvinism and other oppression within their organization, and their uncritical support of allies of U.S. imperialism abroad betray a deeply anti-people politics. RGA\u2019s approach is in direct contradiction with the constant efforts of Mao and others in the CCP to discredit this sort of metaphysical view of leadership and politics. Despite RGA\u2019s claim to uphold the anti-revisionist ICM, and to uphold MLM, they are actually in disagreement with its fundamental principles. In the end we are left with a lot of glorification of names by RGA but a near complete gutting of the revolutionary content behind these names\u2014a tendency which historically has been referred to as \u201cleftist\u201d phrase-mongering. Mao\u2019s denunciation of Lin Biao\u2019s \u201cgenius-theory\u201d sums up the orientation behind such an approach to politics: \u201cThen there is this business of \u2018glorification.\u2019 They pretend to glorify me. In truth they want to glorify themselves.\u201d","created_utc":1514408687,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"TotallyErected","body":"Don't feel discouraged if you are just beginning to read about these things.  There is a lot to understand and people have spent the better part of their lives studying the global economy.  \n\nThe really simple answer about where money comes from is that central banks like the European Central Bank, The US Federal Reserve, or the People's Bank of China loan out sums of money to various private banking institutions, which can then multiply the amount created through what is called a fractional reserve banking system.  This is the dominant financial system of the global market.  It might seem ridiculous that money is just created, but the reason for doing this is actually quite important to the way the economy runs.  Though for now that is already getting too deep.\n\nThe important thing to understand about money, however, is that it cannot create value on its own.  Value is created by labor.  Labor creates things that can both be used as well as exchanged for other things.  A hammer is something that people make with their labor which can be used for a variety of things such as driving nails into wood or smashing the skulls of your enemies.  Hammers can also be traded for other things, like money.  That is what a shopkeeper does when they sell things to their customers, they trade stuff for money.  Money, on the other hand, is only really useful for exchanging things.  You can't use it to drive nails into wood, dig a hole in the earth, or harvest grain.  It derives its value from the fact that it can be exchanged for other things.  It would be next to worthless if it couldn't be traded. \n\nI don't really have the energy at the moment to get deep into how this relates to imperialism, if you want to know more about money specifically you might as well go to the first three chapters of [Marx's *Capital Vol. 1*]( https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/).  I'll be honest it is not an easy read, but the academic you mentioned before, David Harvey, has a series of helpful lectures about what the book is saying which you can access for free on youtube or his website.  As for imperialism itself, [Lenin's *Imperialism*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/) is a good place to start.\n","created_utc":1514442945,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

That is the current trend and there's no reason to think it will change no matter what Trump promises.\n\nChina's future economic prosperity *is not* trade with the US -- it's developing the markets of EurAsia, Africa and Latin America.

Even before announcing his new cabinet, Mnangagwa installed a key reformist, Patrick Chinamasa, as acting finance minister, tasked with tackling corruption and re-engaging with international institutions to unlock funds to ease liquidity shortages. The president also announced the indigenization ministry will be disbanded and the program scaled back. He has proposed reforms, such as tax breaks for mining firms and commercial farmers, aiming to assist export-oriented businesses and earn Zimbabwe much-need hard currency. Mnangagwa is also taking steps to shift the culture in government towards assisting, rather than inhibiting business...Revitalizing Zimbabwe\u2019s economy will not be an easy task...having regularly defaulted on its debts, few international institutions are willing to lend to the government, forcing it to rely on poorly capitalized local banks...accelerating growth will require Mnangagwa to convince institutions like the African Development Bank and the World Bank...that the government is now a reliable borrower...As Mnangagwa\u2019s reforms begin to gradually stabilize the economy, significant opportunities will emerge across an array of sectors and segments \u2013 both formal and informal \u2013 for companies hoping to expand in this relatively under-served, but high-potential market.

After being in power for more than 3 decades, its leaders and cadre are not being wooed only for money &amp; power but even ideologically. They are part of religious ceremony, communal activities and other petty bourgeois activities, which even a sympathiser would be ashamed of. Their ignorance and superstition could not have suddenly germinated and grown but must have been developing since long.\nThe leadership lost the touch of their party members, as they were busy in parliamentary democracy (Down to Vidhan Sabha, MLCs, Mukhiya, etc), which was nothing but bourgeois politics. Left was more worried to protect bourgeois constitution than the right wing political parties. The constitution was created by Congress with the help of Ambedkar to serve the interests of the big capitalists and landlords and not the working class and peasants.\nThe training of the working class, peasants, students, youths was abandoned. Even the cadre and leaders were not part of any study circle, training. Class Struggle remained a theory in books and it became meaningless in practice. It naturally led to opportunism even in top leaders and that followed revisionism!\nTime to wake up? What we see now is panic actions to recover the lost ground through processions, meetings, more efforts to win elections, more and serious activities on social media, more participation in people's function, like religious and cultural functions, etc. But is there any call or training to unite on class line to capture the state power and establish dictatorship of the proletarian class? Is there any effort to revive the party on Bolshevik line?\nI am not aware, but surely I have not seen any \"Self criticism\", a potent weapon of any Communist Party to correct its deviations, mistakes. Defeat after defeat, like Congress and the effort is to save its vote bank and seats in LS/VS!\nI may be wrong, but the result is bad. It's shrinking base, running away cadre to the more powerful and richer party, total disregard to the building of proletarian culture and revolutionary ideology is highly disturbing.\nStill, the Left is not talking of any revolution and out of Bengal, its falling back to even AAP in Delhi, Punjab, etc. In Kerala, its cadre are being harassed by RSS, even though it has its own government. Is this a culture of a revolutionary party? It still has not accepted that fascism is within our society &amp; government and all its machineries!\nHope there is self criticism among the lower and middle level cadre, some soul searching, going back to classical Marxism Leninism, back to revolutionary ideology, understanding of class unity and struggle, need of a revolution, which will establish dictatorship against the bourgeois class to negate any possibility of restoration of capitalism!\nWorking class is not attracted to any Communist Party, which is devoid of revolutionary ideologies and revolutionary programmes!\n","created_utc":1514647133,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

The labour movement will be able to secure trade union rights and welfare benefits for workers under the current changing circumstances provided that it adopts an all-inclusive united approach in campaigning for trade union rights, the establishment and revitalization of independent trade unions and by establishing close ties with the popular movement campaigning for the rejection of the theocratic regime.\n\nhttp://www.tudehpartyiran.org/index.php/en/temparticles/2241-2013-10-02-23-37-37\n\n&gt;It goes without saying that our nation is in need of significant political, economic and social changes. It is also important to note that despite the Anti-American rhetoric voiced by the theocratic regime in Iran all the major socio \u2013economic policies of the regime, including their latest attack on workers\u2019 rights, are nothing but right wing reactionary policies prescribed by the World Bank and the IMF.\n\n&gt;Having stated these facts we strongly believe that the struggle of the Iranian people against theocratic dictatorship is a matter only for the Iranian people to pursue and advance. The pro peace forces in Iran therefore strongly condemn any outside interference in our country\u2019s internal affairs under any pretext.\n\n&gt;We believe that it is only through mobilisation and the pressure of world public opinion against the disastrous ambitions of Imperialism and its allies that we can stop another military adventure in the region. In this vital and critical struggle, the progressive forces have a major responsibility, to mobilise the widest spectrum of social forces in opposition to war, militarism and imperialism\u2019s interventionist and aggressive policies. We are only as effective as our ability to bring people to the streets to fight for peace, bread and jobs.\n\nIranain communists should use the protests to build independent working class power and a mass communist party. Foreign communists should oppose the efforts of their own imperialists to interfere in this process and violate the national self-determination of the Iranian people.

{"author":"communist_alt_acct","body":"I would like to think that this protest movement can go in a good direction, or that the Tudeh Party can at least make use of this to strengthen itself and lead a working class movement for a better Iran. However, the past several years have made me very paranoid of this sort of thing. Perhaps I think too highly of the power of US imperialism, and perhaps my fear of it is leading me to a reactionary policy of doubting every protest movement everywhere, but this just seems really suspicious to me, and I don't ever want to be in a situation again where I support some protest movement or uprising and then years later I find out, \"Haha, that was a US op all along!\" That happened to me with Libya, and while I was never a rah-rah supporter of the uprising, I did think well of it, and even having done that makes me feel dirty.\n\nOf course, while the past is a great teacher, it does not necessarily indicate everything about the current moment. ~~It has been suggested that there is at least a section of the protesters, and perhaps even a majority, that is responding to serious problems (I have heard it said that prices for basic foodstuffs have gone up significantly).~~ However, other reports I have heard indicate that a portion of the protesters seem to be pro-monarchy, and there have also been reports of chants against Hezbollah, Gaza, Syria, and the like.\n\nI really want to believe that Tudeh could form a successful mass communist party and build independent working class power in Iran. Certainly the fact that Tudeh has a long history as a serious working class party says much in its favor, and unless things have gone really pear-shaped lately it is not a cat's-paw like the Mujaheddin e-Khalq. But that desire is tempered by the bitter knowledge of what has happened in the past. I know I should not merely react to the past and let what has happened in the past dictate how I react to current circumstances... but nevertheless, the events of the past have made me vary wary.\n\nFor now, I will take a cautious approach to this matter and put my trust in Tudeh. Then again, I'm not really sure how much it even matters. We talk about opposing our own country's imperialism, and I definitely agree with that, but I'm not really sure how to effectively do that, how to effectively disrupt US imperialism here at home.\n\nE: I'm not sure about the claim that these protests are about the price of food going up. The source I had for that seems suspicious now that I look into it. I will edit again if I find evidence from a trustworthy source that it is so.","created_utc":1514680907,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"1krix2krix","body":"The way I count it, there are six collectives with an obvious and apparently decent level of unity (they all wrote [this document](http://www.redspark.nu/en/imperialist-states/opportunism-vs-maoism-st-louis-revolutionary-collective-as-a-lesson-for-the-us-maoist-movement/)). Then there is Mass Prole, who has no obvious unity with any other collective, and St Louis Revolutionary Collective, who has no obvious unity with any collective.\n\nTo me it seems like the movement is doing as it should: creating principled unity through struggle where possible (the six collectives working together) and rejecting those who refuse to struggle for functional unity (those two isolated ones).\n\nYour argument doesn't really make much sense with a glance at the historical record. It would be like saying \"Jesus Christ, the revolutionaries in Russia need to get their shit together. Mensheviks, Bolsheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries, all these alleged Marxists can't seem to get along with each other.\"\n\nBut it turns out that having the correct line is more important than just joining up with anyone who claims to be of the same ideology as you. Not to suggest that the numbers in each group today are remotely similar, just to point out that your principle isn't a good one if the question is actually making revolution.","created_utc":1514693200,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
