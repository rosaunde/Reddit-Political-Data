{"author":"andryusha_","body":"Nah you're right. \n\n\u201cWhat all these apologists for Chinese capitalism ignore is the fact that there was a coup in China in 1976 that involved a seizure of state apparati, a seizure of the media (as alluded to above) and the imprisonment of high officials in the Maoist camp (the so-called \u201cGang of Four\u201d).(9) People in the resistance were executed for organizing and distributing literature.(10) There were arrests and executions across the country, in seemingly large numbers. Throughout 1977 a mass purge of the party may have removed as many as a third of its members.(11) \n\nThe armed struggle and repression in 1976 seems to have involved more violence than the Cultural Revolution, but this is swept under the rug by pro-capitalists. In addition, the violence in both cases was largely committed by the capitalist-roaders. While a violent counterrevolution was not necessary to restore capitalism in the Soviet Union, it did occur in China following Mao Zedong\u2019s death.\n\nAt the time of Mao\u2019s death, Deng was the primary target of criticism for not recognizing the bourgeoisie in the Party. Hua Guofeng, who jailed the Gang of Four and seized chairmanship after Mao\u2019s death, continued this criticism of Deng at first, only to restore all his powers less than sixteen months after they were removed by the Maoist government.(12)\n\nThe Western media regularly demonizes China for its records on humyn rights and free speech. Yet, this is not without reason. By the 1978 Constitution, the so-called CCP had removed the four measures of democracy guaranteed to the people in the 1975 Constitution: \u201cSpeaking out freely, airing views fully, holding great debates and writing big character posters are new forms of carrying on socialist revolution created by the masses of the people. The state shall ensure to the masses the right to use these forms.\u201d(13)\n\nThis anti-democratic trend has continued over the last forty years, from jail sentences for big character posters in the 1980s and the Tianamen Square massacre in 1989 to the imprisonment of bloggers in the 2010s. While supporters of Xi Jinping have celebrated his recent call for more Marxism in schools, The Wall Street Journal reports that this is not in the spirit of Mao: \n\n\u201cStudents at Sun Yat-sen University in southern China arrived this year to find new instructions affixed to classroom walls telling them not to criticize party leadership; their professors were advised to do the same\u2026 An associate professor at an elite Beijing university said he was told he was rejected for promotion because of social-media posts that were critical of China\u2019s political system. \u2018Now I don\u2019t speak much online,\u2019 he said.\u201d(14)\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Coup of 1976 \u201d from MIM (Prisons) review \u201c Is China an Imperialist Country?

{"author":"FunEconomics","body":"I've done a lot, in several different countries, and have checked out for about the past 6 months-year. \n\n1. My personal life has taken me to various cities in the Americas and Europe, I've been in everything from the Canadian NDP to Anarchist groups in the Netherlands, also the DKP in Germany and Jugendwiderstand. \n\n2. I've tried to get involved in some way wherever I found myself, even if the politics don't always line up as long as something gets done. I often do a quick google/facebook and am able to find something located where I am and send out messages/feelers. Demos are great places to meet because obviously not much is going on and there's no great risk (unless they're ready to do shit then they won't meet anyway.)\n\n3. I disagree with this assertion. It is extremely disheartening to see the same gatekeeping, gas lighting and abuse repeated in groups from entirely different cultures. Many of the worst abusers I have seen are enjoying privileged positions to this day, as long as the cult of personality is alive and well. People are manipulative, others are doing it because they really believe in the idea, and the mix is very toxic and repeats itself a tonne. A metric tonne.\n\n4. Did I see your group this year? If I can ask, who did you march with/who do you consider your comrades? There's a wide variety on display. It was a pretty good turnout, but from my experience that's about all cross-border coordination is. Facebook likes, sending a delegation to drink for 2 nights and go home etc. It's very hard for Irish comrades to meaningfully engage with whatever's going on in the German Jugendwiderstand for example. Imagine the issues your local group is working on in your area, how could a group dealing with their local issues contribute to achieving your goals while barely keeping theirs going as well? International solidarity and discussion of ideas at conferences etc. is important, but in reality if localized struggles aren't taking off how can we expect the Norwegian delegation to make a great change in Barcelona?\n\nSorry if some of this seems depressing, but there's no denying the reality of what \"real life political activism\" really means. Careerists and their devoted acolytes, people like myself who are sometimes just passing through due to circumstance, or just a group of stoners who think that living without central heating is fighting capitalism. I've seen a wide variety, and I'm checking out for a while. \n\nI think realistically it's better to practice the AEIOU at your place of work. Agitate, Educate, Instigate, Organize, and then Unionize. I've tried it that way and had some success.","created_utc":1517518418,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"reddit_is_pretty_rad","body":"Communism is a government-less, class-less, money-less society. In this society people would be free to do whatever they want. \n\nObviously if we could make that system work, it would be better than capitalism. The main criticism of communism is that such a system would be very difficult to bring about. Most communists agree with this point. \n\nThe difference between a capitalist thinker and a communist thinker is that when we produce enough food for 1.5x the world's population and let 20 million starve in 2017 the capitalist says \"that's how the world is\" while a communist says \"we can do better\"\n\nThere are many different schools of thought about how we can achieve communism:\n\nAnarchists believe that if you got rid of governments then people would naturally organize themselves in a communistic way. (this has never been successful usually they all get killed by capitalists)\n\nMarxist-Leninists believe that a revolution must establish a government that would bring about the conditions for it's own \"whittling away\". (soviet union, cuba, burkina faso, vietnam etc)\n\nReformists want our governments to treat the symptoms of capitalism and allow people to naturally gravitate towards communism. (Scandinavia, as well as most of the 41 socialist parties in government around the world. this is what bernie sanders was too, a lot of communists hate this one BTW)\n\nEco-socialists believe an ecological crisis is inevitable and that this crisis will bring about the necessary conditions for communism.\n\nUnionists think that a general strike could give rise to a socialist state. If we all just refused to work then we could get a socialist system put in place.\n\nCommunism is a goal to strive for. It's not comparable to capitalism, it's a higher level of social development, where people are connected to their community and their work. The point isn't to build communism here and now, but instead to move us in that direction.\n\nIf you think I was too vague and you want to know how people could think this is even possible then you'll have to read a lot of books. I recommend reading conquest of bread and mutual aid by kropotkin, marx-engles reader is good, capital from marx is good, statism and anarchy is good if you wanna know about hierarchies and stuff, homage to catalonia by george orwell is pretty uplifting.\n\n\n","created_utc":1517529955,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Jobhi","body":"Comrade, I am working with the following arguments to demonstrate LTV, to demonstrate it step by step. Do tell me if it would \"work\" on the desired audience (Layman) on an intuitive level -\n\n1. Labor time has something to do with price. [Commodities that require more time per unit to produce are more expensive than those that require less time per unit to produce. A candy is cheaper than a lamp as it takes less amount of time to produce a candy. Another example - within the same industry, 10 men can produce 10 tables faster than 3 men can produce 3 tables, hence can out-compete the 3 men by producing it for cheaper. Air is free, however, because of pollution, now it requires expenditure of labor to clean air, and have we have to pay for it.]\n2. Lower the prices, higher the demand. [Market creates a competitive pressure to lower the prices or get out competed. ] \n3. Introduction of machinery decreases the labor time, hence brings the prices down. \n\nFrom this, we get SNLT. \n\nRebuttal to Austrian Economics -\n\n1. . The Austrians have this explanation : - Prices are prerequisite to make Subjective evaluation (of Purchase / to purchase or not), while Subjective evaluations are used to explain prices. To expose this circular reasoning for what it is, we must ask, how without the given price would you as the buyer be able to determine if it is \"worth the price\" for you? And when you can not determine if something is \"worth the price\" without prices \"already being there\", how can these prerequisite prices (for subjective evaluation of it being \"worth the price\") be derived from what can not happen without these prerequisite prices?  \n\n2. The practical problem. If no man can bring the value of a commodity below the level of the value of necessities required to sustain the producer, is it not self evidently false that value can be subjective, can be \"anything\", \"whatever someone wants\"? And, therefore, prices can not be subjective? That they have to be at least equal to or more than the prices of necessities required to sustain the worker? \n\n3. Market competition, expansion of labor force, introduction of machinery, and so forth among producers has absolutely nothing to do with consumer subjective evaluation of \"worth of commodity\" (consumer was already paying the given price, paying \"What it was worth\"), yet emergence and intensification of competition constantly brings prices down of commodities (as lower the prices, higher the demand). Capitalist introduces technology which increases productivity - amount of time required to make a commodity - which brings the prices down. Nothing to do with subjective evaluation. \n\nAlso, this https://i.redditmedia.com/wVXcwPofjshP7_GIuW40KI3t7AXwJurPOaiFseu6cKQ.png?w=500&amp;s=f9fb66e8130a62bd42c352ef837dbd08\n","created_utc":1517636806,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"lilsnarty","body":"Your apology is appreciated, as your language does come off as insulting. What you're essentially saying is, to a transwoman, \"Why would you ever want to be a woman? Nobody wants that,\" or to a transman, \"Why would you ever want to be a man? Nobody wants that,\" which is kind of clearly the wrong path of thinking. Yes, in some ways, \"the trans phenomenon\" is conformity to a societal binary that is partially the result of the development of oppressive modes of society. \n\nOn the other hand, it represents a strong individualist desire. It is no coincidence that people who wish to live ***outside*** this binary, nonbinary people, are also grouped as transgender. If you look at a subreddit like r/transgender or r/LGBT, then you'll see lots of 'transgender' people with flairs like \"bigender\" or \"agender\" or \"nonbinary\" accompanied by the transgender flag. The movement is not about switching between social constructs, but finding and fulfilling whatever identity one truly feels.  Identity means a lot to humans, and just because this has been hijacked by commercialism, does not mean it is not still important.\n\nWhile Communists are often portrayed as collectivists, uniformists, and radical egalitarians at the cost of personal identity, this actually goes against Marxist teachings. Marx's original desire for society was freedom of all individuals to do as they wish and fulfill themselves to the maximum. Desiring to fulfill one's personal identity is not conforming to the societal standards, it is breaking from the trappings of being unfortunately born into standards one ***doesn't*** wish to conform to. \n\nWhen you say, \"Transgender is itself repressive,\" you fail to understand that someone who identifies as a gender they were not assigned at birth is actively fighting against repression they were unfortunately born with. \n\nTo me it seems as if you have actually come to believe the Western lies about what Communism is, if you feel as if there is no room for personal expression within the movement.

I actually reject the notion that I have succumbed to Western lies, as I know that communism is all about freeing people from necessity so that they can truly express themselves. I suppose the biggest point of confusion and concern on my part is that my view of gender is not that it's nonbinary so much as it simply doesn't exist beyond an idea; one that is inherently oppressive. What I see is a movement acknowledging gender and encouraging fluidity within it. I also struggle with the actual transformation part of it, because it's almost a rejection of the self not the idea of gender. I hate to use the phrase self-mutilation because it's a reactionary line used in this kind of discussion, but surgically altering yourself to arrive at a more comfortable  place within a construct that is oppressive does not seem liberating it seems more like an appeasement to the pervading ideology responsible for the forced conformity and resultant trauma to begin with.

{"author":"lilsnarty","body":"You're right about the nature of gender as being entirely a social construct. Let me try to make a comparison, and please forgive me if I offend you (as I understand that the suffering of trans people, objectively speaking, just does not compare to the suffering of other minorities.)\n\nIn black liberation, there is an emphasis on black cultures and the self-identification of black persons. I was originally of the belief that this was reactionary and wrong but it was explained to me like this:\n\n\"While the end goal is to abolish race, the identity that comes with it is valuable and validating, and by strengthening the sense of community among black people, we strengthen the black liberation movement-- which, in turn, will further the struggle to abolish race.\"\n\nSimilarly, I would contend that while all *woke* transgender people desire to abolish gender, they take comfort and are strengthened by being able to self identify with a gender, as it is *very* unlikely to be abolished within their lives. It comes down to desiring to function a certain way within the unfortunate constraints of a modern society. This way often is at odds with these constraints, and is therefore not necessarily reactionary and is sometimes a deconstruction of these constraints.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nAs to your qualms about \"transforming,\" let me address some things:\n\n1) A transition is not defined by genital reconstruction. To define a transition as such is actually \"biologism\" and is reactionary. Many poor transgender people cannot afford genital reconstruction, and thus do not consider it part of their transition. A lot of transgender people that can afford it also do not undergo the procedure because they don't feel like they even have to. It is simply an expensive cosmetic surgery. Laws that require this surgery for a legal change of gender are just that; laws created by bourgeoisie Capitalists to oppress others. There is absolutely no connection between gender identity and genitalia, and genital reconstruction should be mostly discounted. The codification of this made-up connection is bourgeoisie propaganda, lies, and repression. This mostly addresses your charge of 'rejection of self' and self mutilation. \n\nI know that a lot of transgender women just think of themselves as girls who happen to have a penis, just like some girls happen to have a vagina. Similarly, there are lots of transgender men who are dudes who happen to wear a vagina, and sometimes happen to have overactive mammary glands. There are terms in the transgender community that encapsulate this; lots of transgender women say \"I had testosterone poisoning when I was younger,\" (and estrogen poisoning for transmen) rather than saying they were ever a gender that really they weren't.\n\nSimilarly, with nonbinary people, there is no genital reconstruction that can be done to \"biologize\" a nonbinary gender identity. Yet, Germany and California are now recognizing the third gender as it's being called in bourgeoisie legalese. A person wrongfully designated female at birth who does not want to identity as a man or a woman has no surgery to pursue, but that does not diminish their identity in the least. \n\n2) Measures that are pursued outside of reconstruction generally are limited to physiological means. For example, therapy, hormone replacement, and the wearing of certain garments. These just come down to emotional/mental ego, hormonal content, and fashion. These things are by no means linked to the genital obsession of people engaged in \"biologism,\" yet are more important than genitalia to transgender persons. As I mentioned above, many transgender people never reconstruct their genitals as they don't feel the need to and/or wouldn't be able to if they had the whim. Just dressing the right way, being called the right pronouns, and having the right juices in their body is most often enough. \n\nIn this sense, there is not actually a clinging-to of one bourgeoisie, constructed gender or another; just an individualist self identification. A transwoman who seeks to demolish gender and has a good grasp on Marxist criticisms of socialized oppression (cough me cough) is not adhering to the bourgeoisie, liberal feminist \"GIRL POWER\" philosophy that cements the oppressive construction of gender. She is a human being of no particular gender who prefers a certain set of pronouns, takes a medicine to induce the production of hormones she is more comfortable having in her body, and wears dresses, skirts, and \"feminine\" clothing. One of my close friends, a nonbinary person designated F at birth, is another human being of no particular gender who prefers the use of they/them, binds their chest as this makes them feel more comfortable and realized, and wears clothing of no discernible gender. Finally, another close friend of mine is a human being of no particular gender who is known by he/him, binds his chest, and takes a medicine to induce the production of testosterone as it makes him feel more realized. There is no fetishization of one of these three bourgeoisie, constructed genders; we simply identify a certain way. It is the same way a cisgender Marixst-feminist is proud to be a woman and self-identifies as such, while also not wanting to build gender roles, and most importantly wanting to abolish all organs of oppression (be they gender, race, class, et cetera.) \n\n~~~~~~~~\n\nDoes this clear things up? I absolutely understand how you feel-- before I read up on decolonization, I was painfully ignorant of what it meant to \"abolish the concept of whiteness\" and it was extremely frustrating to try to explain it to me. \n\nedit: and, again, thank you so, so much for reaching out. it means a lot to us that Communism is on our side-- but, of course, Communism is always on the side of the oppressed. it is natural for all oppressed peoples, not matter what degree of oppression they face, to join the Communist cause.

{"author":"jebemkodyodrana","body":"maybe the first points should be in line of \"we historically never reached communism\"\n\nas for LTV- productivity and wages is not the best argument- if you read capital vol 3., specificall chapter 15, I think Marx shows that you can have increases/decreases in productivity and wages could go up/down independently- it is not causal relation between them.\naustrian ecnomics and all vulgar economy of prices is based on circular logic- however, prices in capitalism don't operate through LTV (transformation problem) so I think it would be better to argue about emptiness of market competition, here is a nice quote from C.vol.3,: \"Nothing is easier than to realise the inconsistencies of demand and supply, and the resulting deviation of market-prices from market-values. The real difficulty consists in determining what is meant by the equation of supply and demand.\n\nSupply and demand coincide when their mutual proportions are such that the mass of commodities of a definite line of production can be sold at their market-value, neither above nor below it. That is the first thing we hear.\n\nThe second is this: If commodities are sold at their market-values, supply and demand coincide.\n\nIf supply equals demand, they cease to act, and for this very reason commodities are sold at their market-values. Whenever two forces operate equally in opposite directions, they balance one another, exert no outside influence, and any phenomena taking place in these circumstances must be explained by causes other than the effect of these two forces. If supply and demand balance one another, they cease to explain anything, do not affect market-values, and therefore leave us so much more in the dark about the reasons why the market-value is expressed in just this sum of money and no other. It is evident that the real inner laws of capitalist production cannot be explained by the interaction of supply and demand (quite aside from a deeper analysis of these two social motive forces, which would be out of place here), because these laws cannot be observed in their pure state, until supply and demand cease to act, i.e., are equated. In reality, supply and demand never coincide, or, if they do, it is by mere accident, hence scientifically = 0, and to be regarded as not having occurred. But political economy assumes that supply and demand coincide with one another. Why? To be able to study phenomena in their fundamental relations, in the form corresponding to their conception, that is, is to study them independent of the appearances caused by the movement of supply and demand. The other reason is to find the actual tendencies of their movements and to some extent to record them. Since the inconsistencies are of an antagonistic nature, and since they continually succeed one another, they balance out one another through their opposing movements, and their mutual contradiction. Since, therefore, supply and demand never equal one another in any given case, their differences follow one another in such a way \u2014 and the result of a deviation in one direction is that it calls forth a deviation in the opposite direction \u2014 that supply and demand are always equated when the whole is viewed over a certain period, but only as an average of past movements, and only as the continuous movement of their contradiction. In this way, the market-prices which have deviated from the market-values adjust themselves, as viewed from the standpoint of their average number, to equal the market-values, in that deviations from the latter cancel each other as plus and minus. And this average is not merely of theoretical, but also of practical importance to capital, whose investment is calculated on the fluctuations and compensations of a more or less fixed period.\nOn the one hand, the relation of demand and supply, therefore, only explains the deviations of market-prices from market-values. On the other, it explains the tendency to eliminate these deviations, i.e., to eliminate the effect of the relation of demand and supply. (Such exceptions as commodities which have a price without having a value are not considered here.) Supply and demand may eliminate the effect caused by their difference in many different ways. For instance, if the demand, and consequently the market-price, fall, capital may be withdrawn, thus causing supply to shrink. It may also be that the market-value itself shrinks and balances with the market-price as a result of inventions which reduce the necessary labour-time. Conversely, if the demand increases, and consequently the market-price rises above the market-value, this may lead to too much capital flowing into this line of production and production may swell to such an extent that the market-price will even fall below the market-value. Or, it may lead to a price increase, which cuts the demand. In some lines of production it may also bring about a rise in the market-value itself for a shorter or longer period, with a portion of the desired products having to be produced under worse conditions during this period.\n\nSupply and demand determine the market-price, and so does the market-price, and the market-value in the further analysis, determine supply and demand. This is obvious in the case of demand, since it moves in a direction opposite to prices, swelling when prices fall, and vice versa. But this is also true of supply. Because the prices of means of production incorporated in the offered commodities determine the demand for these means of production, and thus the supply of commodities whose supply embraces the demand for these means of production. The prices of cotton are determinants in the supply of cotton goods.\n\nTo this confusion \u2014 determining prices through demand and supply, and, at the same time, determining supply and demand through prices \u2014 must be added that demand determines supply, just as supply determines demand, and production determines the market, as well as the market determines production.

These are the empires that grow and last longest, those with the largest economies. always.\n\nSo yeah, when the Yuan will replace the Dollar as global currency, we don't quite know. But, it certainly will, and likely within our lifetimes. \n\nIn 2008, Chinese economy was smaller than Japan. Just 10 yrs later, it's nearly the size of US. It's growing ridiculously fast, and won't stop. Also, China are already well under way towards making nearly every country in Africa into economically colonized vassal states themselves.. not to mention Iran and other countries already basically exist as vassal states of Russia and China (and to a lesser extent EU and US multinationals) for purposes being throughpoints of illegal trade of weapons and surveillance technologies to national governments.https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/20_Largest_economies_pie_chart.pdf/page1-624px-20_Largest_economies_pie_chart.pdf.jpg","created_utc":1517840134,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Jobhi","body":"Hey, can you proof read for me? Following your advice, I made a new draft. \n\n&lt;Have to insert introduction to Austrian economics and how the \"Value is subjective\" is essentially derived from&gt;\n\nA. No purchaser, or their subjective evaluations, can determine the price of a commodity to become less than the prices of essentials (food) required to keep the worker alive when he makes the commodity. This is a simple, objective reality, which might be common sense to many, and it confronts us if we chose to think if the price of a commodity can be subjectively decided; brought lower or higher to \"Whatever\" one feels.\n\nIf a worker can not survive for less than 1$ a day, while making 1 unit of commodity per day, the commodity can *not* be cheaper than 1$ a day. It's value can not be \"Subjectively decided\". The worker needs a certain amount of money to live - &gt; the \"cost\" of worker necessitates that the commodity needs a certain amount of money to be made below which it \"can not go\". It can not be \"Subjectively decided\" that it can be less than 1 $. If the purchaser wants it, the price of \"equal to or more than\" 1$ has to be paid.\n\nB. The \"subjective evaluations\" theory of Austrian economics is founded on a circular Logic. Subjective evaluation are explained by price, they require price \"as a given\". But prices are then explained using subjective evaluation.\n\nTo expose this circular reasoning, one must simply ask, what must come first? Prices, or subjective evaluation? All confusions should evaporate there after.\n\nWithout the existing price (price label on the commodity), how would the buyer be able to determine if something is \"worth the price\" for him / her? And if something is \"worth the price\" can not be evaluated without prices, if prices are prerequisite to make the subjective evaluation, how can these prerequisite prices be derived from subjective evaluations, since subjective evaluations can not occur without these prerequisite prices?\n\nC. Inflation and \"Increase in quantity of money\" is another common complaint among the Austrians. As money's supply goes up in a \"unwarranted\" manner, prices goes up. More money \"poured\n into the society - &gt; more cash to spend on the existing amount of commodities - &gt; more \"bidders\" arise - &gt; prices can be raised. \n\nAs per Austrians, it is the individual subjective evaluation, and not anything outside of the individual, happening in the society - not the conditions of production - that determines prices. \n\nHow does then sudden \"pouring of free money\" (\"Fiat money\") into the society suddenly raise the prices? \n\nWith their \"new found cash\", consumers could only want \"more of everything\", instead of suddenly \"paying higher than current prices\". No one goes to a shop with \"New found cash\", and purchases what was for 1 $ for 1 million $. One wants a million things, and not a one dollar thing for a million dollar. This, hence, should not raise the prices. \n\nHowever, as \"free money\" is introduced into the society, producers sense a sudden surge in societal collective demand - and then they, the producers and not the customers, could increase the prices. To which, the customers can only respond to.\n\nHere again if you trace prices and their fluctuation and their eventual determination - it does not happen with \"individual subjective evaluation of commodity's worth\" as it's basis. It is the producers who raised the prices. In response to conditions which stimulated the customers, the conditions being \"free money poured into society\". \n\nIn neither the \"pouring of money\", which is the role of capitalist state, and neither the eventual \"raising of prices\", which was done by the producers, the customers played the main cause. They in fact want to \"keep the price the same\". Yet conditions not founded in their \"subjective evaluations\" raised the prices.\n\nD. Likewise, there is another condition outside the \"subjective evaluations\", that also bring the prices down. \n\nEmpirically, market competition, it's introduction, and constant intensification, brings prices down, and keeps them from going high. Market competition is solely a phenomena of production - across a society - it has nothing to do with individual subjective evaluation.\n\nHowever, individuals then respond to lowering of prices by purchasing more of commodities (Again solidifying point 1 - prices are prerequisite of subjective evaluation). Lesser the prices, higher the demand, this being Economics 101. \n\nPlanning to add these -\n\n\"Science starts with observation, and not axioms\".\n\nhttps://i.redditmedia.com/wVXcwPofjshP7_GIuW40KI3t7AXwJurPOaiFseu6cKQ.png?w=500&amp;s=f9fb66e8130a62bd42c352ef837dbd08\n\n","created_utc":1517858544,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Revisionist theory in turn, always have a material basis, which communists have attributed to the lingering bourgeois influence in a socialist society. There's more of an incentive to strengthen that influence in times of economic turmoil / unfavorable international political situation.\n\n\nSpecifically in this case, the conflict could be seen as a gesture of goodwill towards the u.$ and its allies, a sort of announcement that \"it's okay to invest in China\". This is because China needed foreign investment, as it remained an underdeveloped nation after Mao's death, despite all the gains in human development: literacy rates, life expectancy, gender equality, etc... . China was not exactly on good terms with the USSR, and the USSR was having its own problem with revisionism so that practically eliminated the option of Soviet aid. \n\n\nIn nature, the conflict was similar to China's support to the Khmer Rogue (since the CIA was backing Pol Pot). \n\n\nThe alternative explanation that I saw from some Maoist, is to say that there was a counter-revolution in China, and at that point China was a capitalist - social imperialist country, hence the invasion. Which I think is simply wrong even for modern China. But at least for modern China I could understand why people would think that: with China's ventures in Africa - and recently, a military base; along with the clashes in the South China Sea, it does open up space for debate and confusion. With the Sino-Vietnamese conflict however, it's *really far fetched* since the market reforms were in their infant stage, there's no export of capital *at all* to even point to as imperialism.

{"author":"DisgruntlementSquid","body":"I tend to be informed by people who engage in sex work and their contact with others. I think most people rightly assume that sex workers wouldn't do that kind of work if it wasn't necessary. However, they also don't want to feel stigmatised for doing so.\n\nI think the issue here is the liberal capturing of what is essentially a conceptual justification for not hating yourself for doing what you need to do,  and instead turning it into 'liberation', in the same way that people who 'get' to work zero hour contracts supposedly have flexibility and liberty in their choice of work hours. I've seen useful concepts taken to extremes which simply reinforce a repulsive exploitative circumstance many times by people wishing to either prove their radicalism through use of these concepts, or people outright rejecting them out of disgust with conceptually weak liberal applications of potentially useful ideas.\n\nI'd generally lean towards relatively sex criticality in circumstances of unanalised power relations. Bodily autonomy cannot be claimed to be so in exploitative circumstances. \n\nWhere I'd disagree with some of the article is the idea that it's the individuals responsibility to undertake these social changes through some kind of self critical reflection feedback tool, as I'd believe it's generally up to society, or a collective response in general, to direct what behaviour is acceptable. In an abolished private property society, most of these forms of sex work would evaporate. \n\nWhat do we do until then? \n\nI would also like to know the harm that is caused by sex work, in the same way harm is caused under capitalism of workers in mines, or around hazardous chemicals, alongside alienation. Is there a specific harm caused by engaging in sexual activity on a non-self voluntarist basis, in the context of capitalism, that can't also be generalised into other forms of work? I do not know. The people I know who have engaged in sex work simply wish to be safer when trying to make a living. \n\n\"it simply means that we need to think through the ways in which our desire is articulated and attempt to imagine ways beyond the horizon of this desire.\"\n\nThen please do so, if it's so simple. It's not enough to point out a problem, we have ten billion problems and few solutions offered. Would you like state policy? Conduct in communist groups applied by some criteria? A reformist media campaign within liberal democracies as a transitional demand? \n\nI'm very tired of any form of analysis which cannot put its ideas to the test. How about encourage the formation of sex workers unions away from pimps and brothels and so on. Legislation to protect the rights people engaging in such work. Criminilisation, or active poliicies of hostility and exclusion by communists, towards known individuals who abuse others sexually through financial or social cultural domination. A code of conduct on interpersonal behaviours. Understanding of sexual harm, and specific, stated agreements undertaken by communists in a democratic centralist party enforced through punitive measures.\n\nAll these ideas have flaws. But you know what has only one flaw? Not having an idea and being too scared of being criticised to move forward. I've seen this happen too many times leading to abuse. If you cannot weigh up any pros or cons about any course of action, what are you doing but complaining and hoping someone else does the work for you?\n\nThis article also correctly states that puritanical attitudes towards sex have been destructive from a conservative perspective. But then what alternative standards should be undertaken? \n\nLastly, this irritated me - \"but as an historical materialist I refuse to accept that sexual desire exists beyond socialization\"\n\nReally? The urge to procreate is purely socialised? Yes the consequences of that urge and the directions of that behaviour are highly socialised, but the base urge exists in all life. Bacteria aren't socialised into procreating. Fungi aren't influenced by mass media campaigns into their reproductive cycles. This view is, if anything, *anti* materialist. \n\nA more helpful view is how to manage the general base impulses of people, to eat, reproduce, socialise etc in a way which doesn't cause harm. People will have sex. Knowing how to do it well, safely and in an unexploitative way is the key, not pretending any urge itself is somehow the result of capitalist evils.

{"author":"intlnews","body":"Here's [the speech](http://pluralism.org/document/the-world-house-martin-luther-king-jr-1967/) , from what I can find, reprinted from his book, Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community? in 1967. He also denounced the \"actions of America\" in other speeches as well\n\n&gt;...We have inherited a large house, a great \u201cworld house\u201d in which we have to live together\u2014black and white, Easterner and Westerner, Gentile and Jew, Catholic and Protestant,  Moslem and Hindu\u2014a family unduly separated in ideas, culture and interest, who, because we can never again live apart, must learn somehow to live with each other in peace\u2026One of the great liabilities of history is that all too many people fail to remain awake through great periods of social change. Every society has its protectors of the status quo and its fraternities of the indifferent who are notorious for sleeping through revolutions. But today our very survival depends on our ability to stay awake, to adjust to new ideas, to remain vigilant and to face the challenge of change. The large house in which we live demands that we transform this world-wide neighborhood into a world-wide brotherhood...One of the great problems of mankind is that we suffer from a poverty of the spirit which stands in glaring contrast to our scientific and technological abundance. The richer we have become materially, the poorer we have become morally and spiritually...We have allowed the means by which we live to outdistance the ends for which we live...Enlarged material powers spell enlarged peril if there is not proportionate growth of the soul...Western civilization is particularly vulnerable at this moment, for our material abundance has brought us neither peace of mind nor serenity of spirit...You call your thousand material devices \u201clabor\u001esaving machinery,\u201d yet you are forever \u201cbusy.\u201d With the multiplying of your machinery you grow increasingly fatigued, anxious, nervous, dissatisfied. Whatever you have, you want more; and wherever you are you want to go somewhere else\u2026your devices are neither time\u001esaving nor soul\u001esaving machinery...This tells us something about our civilization that cannot be cast aside as a prejudiced charge by an Eastern thinker who is jealous of Western prosperity. We cannot escape the indictment...when scientific power outruns moral power, we end up with guided missiles and misguided men...Our hope for creative living in this world house that we have inherited lies in our ability to re-establish the moral ends of our lives in personal character and social justice...Among the moral imperatives of our time, we are challenged to work all over the world with unshakable determination to wipe out the last vestiges of racism...racism is still that hound of hell which dogs the tracks of our civilization. Racism is no mere American phenomenon. Its vicious grasp knows no geographical boundaries. In fact, racism and its perennial ally\u2014economic exploitation\u2014provide the key to understanding most of the international complications of this generation...Racism can well be that corrosive evil that will bring down the curtain on Western civilization...if Western civilization does not now respond constructively to the challenge to banish racism, some future historian will have to say that a great civilization died because it lacked the soul and commitment to make justice a reality for all men\u2026Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal opposition to poverty, racism and militarism. With this powerful commitment we shall boldly challenge the status quo and unjust mores...A genuine revolution of values means in the final analysis that our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional...This call for a world\u001ewide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern beyond one\u2019s tribe, race, class and nation is in reality a call for an all-embracing and unconditional love for all men...When I speak of love, I am speaking of that force which all the great religions have seen as the supreme unifying principle of life...We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today...We still have a choice today: nonviolent coexistence or violent co-annihilation. This may well be mankind\u2019s last chance to choose between chaos and community.\n\nHe said something similar [in 1959](http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documentsentry/palm_sunday_sermon_on_mohandas_k_gandhi/) \"today it is no longer a choice between violence and nonviolence; it is either nonviolence or nonexistence\" and in 1965 saying that \"call it democracy, or call it democratic socialism, but there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country for all God\u2019s children.\" And [in 1967](https://www.commondreams.org/views04/0115-13.htm) he said \"I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin the shift from a \"thing-oriented\" society to a \"person-oriented\" society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered\" even as he said he was opposed to communism. [Later that year](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article16183.htm) he seemed to go further, saying that \n\n&gt; a true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth with righteous indignation. It will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa, and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say, \"This is not just.\"...A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death...the Western nations that initiated so much of the revolutionary spirit of the modern world have now become the arch anti-revolutionaries. This has driven many to feel that only Marxism has a revolutionary spirit. Therefore, communism is a judgment against our failure to make democracy real and follow through on the revolutions that we initiated. Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty, racism, and militarism...Don't let anybody make you think God chose America as his divine messianic force to be a sort of policeman of the whole world\n\nHe also said [later that year](http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/documentsentry/where_do_we_go_from_here_delivered_at_the_11th_annual_sclc_convention/) that \"we must massively assert our dignity and worth. We must stand up amidst a system that still oppresses us and develop an unassailable and majestic sense of values...Power properly understood is nothing but the ability to achieve purpose. It is the strength required to bring about social, political and economic change...There is nothing wrong with power if power is used correctly\" and seemed to say \"the kingdom of the brotherhood\" is found in a higher synthesis that combines the truths\" of capitalism and communism (I don't think so) while he also said \"now, when I say question the whole society, it means ultimately coming to see that the problem of racism, the problem of exploitation, and the problem of war are all tied together. These are the triple evils that are interrelated.\" \n\nThen there's [his anti-consumerist](http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/documentsentry/doc_the_drum_major_instinct/) Drum Major Instinct speech in 1968, [his speech](http://www.gphistorical.org/mlk/mlkspeech/index.htm) where he says riots are the language of the unheard, and his [final speech](http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/documentsentry/ive_been_to_the_mountaintop/), among other [speeches](https://en.m.wikiquote.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.), as also noted [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sermons_and_speeches_of_Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.)\n\nSo you can take something from MLK, especially toward the end of his life, but he didn't seem to fully embrace communism or even Marxism, although he was informed by it.","created_utc":1518051047,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

However, as disease, infrastructure decay, rising poverty levels and Christianity (which opposed the development of science and technology) became commonplace within these empires, they began to decline.

The message of the Church is to me beautiful, but the people who carry it out are flawed and susceptible human beings.\n\nThe Decree against Communism was carried out by Pope Pius XII, a very conservative pontiff who allowed the Church to be swayed by Western political doctrine in the beginning of the Cold War. The decree came at a time when the Italian Communist Party was a very powerful organization that was close to achieving state power electorally in Italy. I firmly believe it was simply a misapplication of doctrine that goes against Christian doctrine. I don't think anyone in the modern era has been excommunicated on the basis of being a communist. Indeed, many high-ranking members of clergy worked closely with communists or were communists themselves. For example, Salvadoran Archbishop and prominent Liberation Theologian Oscar Romero has now been beatified by the Church and will likely be given Sainthood in the next couple years.\n\nAnother great example of socialist Clergy is Fr.

This is an incorrect accusation because feminists are actually criticizing the violence itself, not lamenting the fact that we aren\u2019t in an upside-down world where wimmin oppress and exploit men like men currently oppress and exploit wimmin. The same principle still applies to feminist discussions of sexuality. BDSM is not a \u201cgender-neutral\u201d phenomenon, but it would still be unhealthy even if it was.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, explaining why the gender balance is as it is\u2013explaining why female dominants can be brought up as exceptions, why the rule exists to be excepted at all\u2013is to also explain why BDSM exists in the first place. BDSM wouldn\u2019t exist without patriarchy, exceptional female dominants included. Even in a situation where the roles are nominally flipped, it is often because of patriarchy\u2014not in spite of patriarchy. If the usual role is for men to be dominant, and wimmin to be submissive, then a female dominant is all the more titillating because it\u2019s \u2018wrong\u2019. The female dominant still exists as a thing for men to consume, because men still hold the sexual power on a structural level. This is what it means for patriarchy to be an all-encompassing aspect of our social reality. Even if the man is in the nominally \u2018submissive\u2019 role instead of the \u2018dominant\u2019 one, the man is still empowered by social context as a man.

{"author":"Raestagg","body":"An interesting excerpt from an \"official\" comprehensive work on ML,the Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism manual the USSR itself put out in 1963, which you can find [here](https://mltheory.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/fundamentals-of-marxism-leninism.pdf). It's 700 pages and deals with just about every major subject you can think of, from philosophy and the economics of capitalism and imperialism to the role of the vanguard, the dictatorship of the proletariat, transition to socialism, transition to communism, etc. On to the excerpted quote from the introduction, that touches briefly on this, the topic of religion: \n\n\u201cMastery of the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism requires serious and thoughtful study and, consequently, much work and time. What are the fruits of such a study?\n\nPut briefly, the answer is that it gives us an integral world outlook, the most progressive outlook of our time, one in which the cardinal components of the great teaching of Marx and Lenin are blended in a harmonious, integral system.\n\nThere are various kinds of world outlook, whether progressive or reactionary. Some of the latter are based on ancient beliefs and superstitions and seek to persuade religious-minded people that they must remain blindly dependent upon some supernatural being and his vicars and anointed regents on earth. Other philosophies, while not openly asserting the existence of a deity and even avowing faith in \u201cscience\u201d resort to subtle but false arguments in an effort to destroy man\u2019s conviction of the real existence of the material world. \n\nThat is the method used by the exponents of the most fashionable trends in modern idealism. Many of them do not themselves believe in the existence of supernatural forces but, influenced by the traditional conventions and prejudices of bourgeois society, are unwilling to close all doors against belief in the supernatural. New discoveries in science, they say, cast doubt on the materiality of nature. And the theologians and clerics support them, on the assumption that people who can be induced to believe in the non-materiality of nature are capable of believing anything. \n\nNot everything that imitates science is real science, just as not everything that glitters is gold. And particularly in our time many varieties of idealist philosophy eagerly assume a scientific guise in order to conceal their anti-scientific substance. In reality, they fear the weighty evidence of scientific facts and seek to hush up or distort these fact.\n\nMarxism-Leninism has great merits that distinguish it from all other philosophical systems. \n\nIt does not recognize the existence of any supernatural forces or creators. It rests squarely on reality, on the real world in which we live. It liberates mankind, once and for all, from superstition and age-old spiritual bondage. It encourages independent, free and consistent thought. \n\nMarxism-Leninism regards the world as it actually is, without adding an invented hell or paradise. It proceeds from the fact that all nature, including man himself, consist of matter with its different properties. \n\nNature, as well as all its individual phenomena, is in constant process of development. The laws of that development have not been ordained by God and do not depend on man\u2019s will. They are intrinsic in nature itself and are fully knowable. There are no inherently unknowable things in the world; there are only things which are still unknown, but which man will increasingly get to know.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, Manual; Second Edition, Foreign Languages Publishing House Moscow 1963, pages 15-16.

{"author":"Septictankie","body":"First time poster but my perspective on the DPRK changed when I started reading subreddits and other sites like this.\n\nI'd say one thing they're doing right is the shared sense of community, which even opponents of the state will acknowledge if they have been there. They exist but are few and far between. I also think, geopolitically, the DPRK is much smarter than U.S. media presents (the ignorant idea that Kim Jong Un is a madman, etc.) The U.S. has been utterly played these past few weeks and that has been on display at the Olympics. \n\nMost South Koreans have no interest in waging some crusade, and Kim has masterfully driven a wedge in the U.S.-ROK alliance with the recent rapprochement - and while the U.S. has acted in a particularly pig-headed manner.\n\nI will not be uncritical of the DPRK, but you have to watch the U.S. media like a hawk here. Case in point is the moralizing about the defector who high-tailed it across the DMZ a few weeks ago in a stolen military jeep, and was shot by North Korean soldiers. This was presented as evidence of the wickedness of North Korea. But it was sites like this that pointed out that South Korean soldiers will shoot and kill people crossing northwards, and did so as recently as 2013, [riddling a defector with hundreds of bullets](https://www.cnn.com/2013/09/16/world/asia/south-korea-border-shooting/index.html). It also turned out that the North Korean defector had [committed homicide](http://www.newsweek.com/north-korea-defector-killed-person-escape-south-korea-787578) in the north, which is what he told *South Korean* investigators.\n\nHowever, I do believe the DPRK has a much more ethno-nationalist view of the world than the left will acknowledge. You can see it expressed explicitly in this recent pro-reunification video from a DPRK YouTube channel. \"[We are a homogeneous nation by same blood.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i-luaeymy8)\" Not a fan. But it's very important to keep in mind that this is not so different from South Korea, which is also very ethno-nationalist, and where loyalty to \"Korea\" as a nation, and the *minjok*, or race, is greater than loyalty to the ROK as a state or the ROK's constitution - which is simply not held to the kind of reverence you see in the U.S.\n\nThis is also why, reportedly, there is concern among some South Korean hardliners were the U.S. to hand over wartime command authority to the ROK, which is being considered. They are concerned that the ROK army might not be willing to fight. If you tell an American this, they will balk, but it's a real concern. Does anyone believe the DPRK army won't fight? They are reckless if they believe they won't.\n\nSouth Korean movies have also increasingly featured stylish, sexy and cool North Koreans. There's even a recent [buddy cop movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSBGOM94PD4) featuring a North Korean cop, who is the athletic martial arts expert, with a bumbling South Korean cop who acts as the comedy relief! That would be absolutely taboo in the United States. South Koreans have a much more nuanced view of this.","created_utc":1518245151,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"ksan","body":"&gt; Many working class people do not have the capital or luxury of time to invest in creating nutritious balanced vegan meals and diets. It is counter productive to hitch the political wagon to veganism if it excludes people based on their wealth.\n\nAnd then:\n\n&gt; If it doesn't benefit the workers, it isn't communist.\n\nSo you agree a vegan diet would be better for their health, but that they do not have the time or the education to follow it. But then immediately follow with a statement about it not being communist because it does not benefit them? So it is good for them but it does not come automatically to the working class and requires work, education and organization. Sounds a lot like communism in general!\n\nAnyway, we can agree that a vegan diet is healthy (much more than the typical Western diet, this is easy to research with google) and in principle cheaper than other alternatives, either in dollars per calories, grams or overall nutrients. Which is why in general high consumption of meat and animal products is historically associated with wealth and nowadays is mostly centered in the imperialist countries with some \"emerging economies\" trying to catch up. The working class of the imperialist countries has now access to cheap meat because of massive subsidies and the extension of industrial production, not because it's somehow cheaper than a \"nutritious vegan diet\" (it is not, it is in fact much more expensive; again, look at per capita consumption trends worldwide).\n\nI do agree that there are important class barriers which have to do with time and easy access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and following a healthy diet in general. A communist should take this into consideration, always. But, first, this has not much to do with money per se (it has to do with money in the sense that money tends to give you time and culture), and second, saying that it does not benefit workers is absolute nonsense. A vegan diet is better for your health and better for the environment; it's also the only sustainable diet in a world of 7+ billion people. If you care about animals as subjects it is obviously better for them, but you do not even need to include this into the debate to have a solid argument which cannot be countered with rhetoric about \"middle class morality\" and such. An for what is worth, the people saying this are almost always invariably middle class themselves; of course there is something important in that too beyond the obvious irony, but that debate can be left for another time.","created_utc":1518266746,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

You are trying to reframe the discussion to suit your narrative, which is intellectually dishonest, and you ignore the most salient point I raise about the accessibility of veganism (which is the raw cost) for the working class, of whom I am one, and have been all my life. \n\nSubsisting on minimum wage does not afford one the luxury of spending time and money trying to meet basic nutritional requirements within a vegan framework. I do however often resort to Ramen noodles, which I suppose does count, but that can not sustain a small family. \n\nVeganism is a particularly insidious cult in that it brooks no disagreement or counter argument, nor does it allow for anything to interrupt its zeal, much like any religion I suppose.\n\nYour assumptions about me and attempts to use logical fallacy and ad hominem attacks makes you a poor debater , and I will not engage further with those who think that veganism is something the working class even has in their priorities.\n\nI will acknowledge my experience is based on my own nation, where vegan diet choices are substantially more expensive and less readily available.\n\nIn my nation, veganism is only embraced by the middle to upper middle classes in affluent suburbs. You simply will not see a working class family here sit down to lentils and beans, which can usually only be sourced through speciality shops in those same suburbs. These suburbs also tend to lean left and vote Greens in federal and state elections, but view the world through a peculiar middle class lens that assumes their less fiscally endowed peers have access to the same capital as them.\n\nThey proselytise the virtues of veganism, and chide the poor and working class who cannot afford or access the diet  they can, which is why I suspect that your last statement is actually correct if reversed- the people espousing the virtues of veganism are invariably middle class, university educated, with capital and assets. \n\nVeganism and its pursuit in the current climate screams privilege.","created_utc":1518277805,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

But it's very important to keep in mind that this is not so different from South Korea, which is also very ethno-nationalist, and where loyalty to \"Korea\" as a nation, and the minjok, or race, is greater than loyalty to the ROK as a state or the ROK's constitution - which is simply not held to the kind of reverence you see in the U.S.\n\nNot seeing how this is \"ethno-nationalist\" at all. This just seems like Korean nationalism, which has a progressive character. The nationalism of oppressed nations is not comparable to that of a settler-colony like the US or an imperialist nation.

{"author":"yvetox","body":" it's our obligation to restore what have been forced to cease, from soviet union to the traditional family values, and only our real actions would define the outgoing reality. The only real reason why Ussr ceased to exist is that people there was unable to hold it anymore. It's the worker's will that define the governement in real socialistic state,and workers are unwilling to defend their own governement that got corrupted and stale. I am living in Ukraine,I can assure you - then we have got the second referendum,where 90% of votes was to be independent of Ussr- the results was fake. But people wasnt ready to defend their own right to have clear referendum with weapon and force protests. But its not only that unwillingness- many of them was not believing in soviet ideology anymore because of all the issues that governement had. Ineffective managament, stale burecracy, quickly declining work ethics- this is what created the foundation for dissolution of ussr. So the people lost their beliefs and though \"maybe living as independent country would be quite good\"... It was only a matter of time when it become clear it doesnt. Now the people of Ukraine paying for their lazyness, unwillingness to act and shortsightedness. But its ok. Everyone paying for their mistakes. We would get rid of nationalistic ideas in a matter of decade or two and would build up a new socialists state there - not because we are so proud of ussr that we want it back - but in fact because it would be the only real option for us to live. Capitalism going to ruin us all,or strenghen us to the point then every active man on earth would understand that he is living in slavery.

{"author":"Septictankie","body":"I think that's true. I also think it's quite possible to see a reunified Korea in the 21st century under Workers Party rule, and that a reunified Korea would look something like China -- with markets opening up, yet with capital under the control of the party and state, as opposed to finance capital controlling the state as we have in the West. And the thing is, China would probably prefer this outcome, too, hence why China has helped the DPRK skirt the sanctions imposed on it by the rest of the world (hint: by capital). I absolutely believe this is possible, but naturally, you're going to be thought of as a crazy person if you say this to people who get their information from the New York Times. \n\nOne way to interpret a lot of outer-track DPRK agitprop designed for South Korean audiences is to show that reunification would not come at a cost to the urban Koreans in Seoul and such. There is a big push to show North Koreans with products that South Koreans take for granted.\n\nThe DPRK nuclear program also helps along this goal. In addition to warding off attack, it's an excellent bargaining chip to get the ROK to expel U.S. troops -- who are often the subjects of ire among the South Korean population. The DPRK can say \"we'll reign in our nuclear program, and give up our warheads, if you kick out the Yankees.\" That would be the beginning of a \"one state / two systems\" confederation akin to China and Hong Kong. The Koreas would share a single foreign policy and two domestic policies. Over time, and I'm talking many decades, this could lead to a reunified Korea with the Workers Party in control, which is what Kim Il Sung stated to his Romanian counterparts back in the 1970s.","created_utc":1518308754,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

While the DPRK supports revolutionary movements overseas, how many of those movements are reading Kim Il Sung?

If we're talking number of citizens fed, the argument is solid.\n\n\nWhile this is a considerable oversimplification, the principle stands. The real issue is the deep entrenchment of animal agriculture into the framework of the global market and society in general. Stripping that down is undeniably problematic.\n\n\nWhile I acknowledge that veganism can be inaccessible, the majority of us who are actually active in debate understand the issue, and are actively seeking to remove barriers.\n\n\nGenerally speaking, most vegans are simply empathetic people attempting to eat a healthy diet according to their desire to limit harm and avoid causing pain.\n\n\nDo we still own products produced under deplorable working conditions?

It's not that we don't recognize these things, we're simply attempting to address what we can, as often as we can.\n\n\nDon't confuse tumblr veganism with leftist veganism, rational veganism, or anything close to a coherent ideal.\n\n\nEdit: Veganism is a pretty wide concept covering resource usage, health, ethical and economic factors. It can't be boiled down to a few simple arguments, unless you count the most frequently cited objective of limiting pain inflicted on perceptive organisms (humans included).\n\n\nEdit 2: I'm broke as fuck. No car, property, anything. Going back to school on government loans. Meat/dairy are by FAR the most expensive ingredients. My grocery bills were halved when I made the transition. Cost is not a factor with proper dietary education (which is admittedly lacking, but obtainable for many). Food deserts are. That's a different issue. Access to staple nutrition is *definitely* a proletarian issue. As are the hooks the ag conglomerates keep in the population by pushing low cost, low nutrition filler foods, feeding the worsening health/medication crises through misinformation,  and the blatant disregard for the safety and health of slaughtergouse workers (ie. Airborne brain matter/bodily fluids, disallowing bathroom breaks, exploiting easily deported illegal workers for free labour, etc.). \n\nI could go on for a while, but the bottom line is that agri-business has become inherently detrimental to workers. *Especially* animal agriculture.","created_utc":1518388370,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

Go in a revolutionary, come out Jesse Jackson (who stole most of his rhetoric from Fred Hampton). Ask all the former Panthers who stuck with Huey Newton after the split and ended up working for the California Democratic Party. This being said, I think there is an opportunity to use elections creatively to secure gains for the masses, prove a point, mobilize people, and give breathing room. However, this must be done under the guidance and auspices of a revolutionary party. There is a time to boycott, and there is a time to participate. The time is determined by the dialectics of a situation. Dogmatically and blindly arguing for boycott or for participation without analyzing the dialectics of a situation is, essentially, left and right opportunism and will lead to errors that go along with them. If there is a gain to be had from participating in an election, there is no reason other than stupidity arising from dogmatism that would lead a Party to argue for abstention.\n\n\n","created_utc":1518447312,"score":13,"subreddit":"communism"}

As a precinct captain I got a one-on-one meeting with him and I asked him what he would do to repeal our Right to Work laws and he responded by kicking me out. It was this moment I gave up on the bourgeois system although I think you could have more success at the municipal level, especially if you are in a smaller town that is not so corrupted by money.\n\nThe danger lies in resting in the shade of your reforms, which is counter-revolutionary. Social democracies are the greatest weapon of the bourgeoisie in countering proletarian revolution through its creation of the labor aristocracy so you must be careful that your reforms do not strengthen the labor aristocracy.

Founded after Trump\u2019s election by an ad hoc left-liberal coalition, GSNAC explicitly took inspiration from the Rojava revolution. Officially, it committed to practicing direct action and mutual aid while abstaining from electoral politics. With that program on offer, GSNAC initially attracted several thousand participants. However, within a few months, a clique of professional Democrats seized control of the organization by undemocratic means. Without consulting other members, they not only began committing to liberal lobbying campaigns in GSNAC\u2019s name, but also unilaterally filed incorporation papers, naming themselves as GSNAC\u2019s officers.

Both positions are useless, unanalyitical naked opportunism or defeatist utraleftist nonsense.\n\nIn fact, Lenin answers this question very well, literally \"Should We Participate in Bourgeoise Parliaments\" -\nhttps://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/lwc/ch07.htm\n\nAs with all activities, you should be considering the strategic advantages and disadvantages - manpower usage, capacity to enact change, platform to appeal to working class people, propaganda purposes, exposing flaws from within the system itself.  However, the easiest advantage of standing, is to gauge the strength of a pro worker platform and to direct further agitation efforts accordingly.\n\nFor example, in the UK, you can stand for local elections for free, requiring only 10 signatures from people on the electoral roll within that ward. There, you can guage the strength of potential support and see if the ward has potential for agitation around other areas. All for just gaining 10 signatures which will give you important practice and skills in speaking to workers outside of leftist bubbles. I had planned to do this myself but illness and life events have interfered. \n\nRegardless, a thorough understanding of the system, and finding a political organisation which can act with unity and good understanding of theory, would maximise the benefits. Just do not see winning an election as anything more than gaining a paid party employee who can agitate, expose corruption and block regressive activity. \n\nThe last warning about electoral activity is that those who actively desire to stand stand tend to be political opportunists, who will split away from the party at the first opportunity and become another bourgeois 'left' party. Elected members should be directly accountable to a democratic centalised party decision making system and to the workers themselves and never in a representative capacity - the toxic environment of elected areas, and the logic of the system itself can suck people in, to the demise of countless ideologically weak but well meaning left governments.

Noone will tell you via TV how much people was evicted by banks for their debts! Noone will tell you today that we have no right to work and right to housing. But, It is possible!\n\nWhat Lenin/Stalin did for Russians poor people: \n1) give them right to work, every factory was forced to employ everyone who want. Only one job requirement - your wish\n2) give them right to housing. Yes, at the the beginnings it was a rooms in a former rich appartments. But then most of people who was working had got their own flats, is free! So, because of this right it was impossible to take someone's home without to give him another! \n\nSo, even be a homeless or jobless will be impossible if we will live under communism. Because it is not personal wish to be homeless, capitalism forced that.","created_utc":1518502574,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"to_the_buttcave","body":"I'd like to answer some of your later questions since the earlier ones have gotten some good responses.\n\nIt's possible for the homelessness crisis to be mitigated even under capitalism - albeit likely it would be a slow and painful process as the poor and homeless are demonized as the messengers of capitalism's inherent failures. This is because it is less expensive to provide homes for the homeless than it is to support the services that their homelessness leads them to use - shelters, hospital bills they cannot pay, etc. (Here's an article in Vox by a notorious liberal pundit that provides some sources: https://www.vox.com/2014/5/30/5764096/its-three-times-cheaper-to-give-housing-to-the-homeless-than-to-keep)\n\nBut under capitalism, if the decision is eventually made to home the homeless, it will inevitably result in abuses - strict rules that materially result in kicking out those with disabilities and others with significant need, the cutting off of other services deemed \"redundant\", government surveillance of these homes eliminating the ex-homeless' privacy and dignity, preferential treatment along racial lines, and many more possible outcomes. \n\nI extrapolated these possibilities based on my personal experiences volunteering in services for the poor. The common perception is that anyone who goes into it is a saint who volunteers out of love, but the reality is that the system is full of people who volunteer to bully and degrade the less fortunate where the eyes of society don't reach.","created_utc":1518530832,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"footspider","body":"Quoting from [this link](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Soviet-Union-vote-to-create-the-state-of-Israel):\nThe formation of a US-UK anti-Soviet axis was a potential nightmare for the Soviet Union, and the Soviets wanted to nip it in the bud.\n\nThe embassies in the Middle East provided two wedge issues for the Soviet Union to use - but they mutually exclusive: Zionism and Pan-Arabism.\n\nPan-Arabism as an ideology desires the unification of the Middle East and the Maghreb into a single bloc, usually a single country or confederation. In the 1940's, this would have also included the Mandate of Palestine. The UK generally viewed Pan-Arabism favorably at this point in history, the US did not.\n\nOn the other hand, Zionism calls for the creation of a Jewish state in what is now Israel and what was then the Mandate of Palestine. The US viewed Zionism somewhat positively - support was much more tepid than it would later become - but the UK, which spent the immediate aftermath of the Second World War fighting with the Irgun and Lehi to keep order in the Mandate, was strongly opposed.\n\nSo by the mid-1940's, it was clear that choosing a wedge issue in the Middle East either meant sticking it to the Americans by embracing Pan-Arabism or sticking it to the British by embracing Zionism. The Soviets chose to stick it to the British for a variety of reasons.\n\nFirst, the United States to that point had a long established position of isolationism with regards to European conflicts. Remember, the Democrats lost the White House in 1920 because they were foolish enough to make that election a referendum on involvement in the League of Nations and it took a sneak attack for the US to finally get in on the Second World War. The Soviets therefore had reason to believe that the US would retreat into itself, if not immediately after the war, then within a few years. This was, of course, a colossal miscalculation, but considering the US had refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles twenty-five years earlier because it would have meant embracing internationalism, it was an understandable misreading.\n\nThere was also the matter of the Jews in Eastern Europe. Those who survived the Holocaust had to go\u00a0somewhere, and it was by no means clear where that would be. The Soviet bloc governments made few efforts to try and aid Holocaust survivors in returning to their homes and having their property restored to them - such efforts would have been extremely expensive and also would have caused civil disturbances in cases where those who profited from appropriating Jewish property would have resisted giving it back. Keeping the Jews penned up in displaced persons camps was not a tenable option, either. Letting them emigrate to the Middle East, however, was. Soviet Jews, on the other hand, were not permitted to emigrate - only 500 were allowed to leave the Soviet Union for the Mandate of Palestine and subsequently Israel in the decade following the Second World War.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that, at this time, the dominant stream of Zionism was Labor Zionism, a left wing ideology responsible for the creation of small-scale socialist[1] settlements such as kibbutzim and moshavim. There was therefore some hope among Soviet policymakers that a state born of Labor Zionism would be pro-Soviet\n","created_utc":1518539902,"score":28,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Calabar_king","body":"Let me tell you why I get mixed feelings about this.\n\nFirst off, I'm the first in line to tell people to get organized. I've done it a lot of times here, in r/communism101, r/socialism, other social media, real life, etc. So much that I must agree with my comrade, you cannot call yourself a revolutionary and/or communist if you're not organized. Being a revolutionary is not a state of mind, it's a commitment. \n\nI'm a member of the Brazilian Communist Party and its Youth for two years now. And here's where my problems with this text start. One, because taking a personal experience as symptom of something is already wrong, left alone being old people. In his speech in 1962, Che is telling the youth that a young communist must struggle to be the first, must have this commitment, must be an example, and he says more or less like this: *a beacon where old people, who lost their faith, can aim and inspire themselves once more*. To be extremely crude in what I mean with this, 1962 happened before 1968, marked by the text as \"end of the struggle of the left\". Therefore we face two options: or the author is wrong of where he/she thinks the problem started, or the problem has another nature and we're failing to grasp.\n\nMy second problem is with \"May 68\". That's eurocentrism to the core. The Vietnamese war did not end until 1975. The Black Panthers Party were founded in 1966; FARC and ELN, in Colombia, in 1964; the Sandinistas in Nicaragua in 1961. I'm no maoist, but Sendero Luminoso, in Peru, didn't start until 1980. Same for FMLN in El Salvador. The 70's watched the liberation movements of Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and Burkina Faso. And I'm not even entering the discussion about India, Philippines and Nepal, or how strong is KKE and the Venezuelan Communist Party nowadays. Yes, Eurocommunism f#cked up a lot of CP's - damn, it f#cked **my party**, and we almost had to lose it to relearn the importance of Marxism-Leninism - but to use a failed french movement to declare a global failure of the revolutionaries is just eurocentrism and white supremacy operating within other tools. If I did not know the dialectical contradictions, I would say that this is extremely strange coming from a Basque with nationalist roots.\n\nMy third problem with this is obvious. I am organized. And I don't say it in a selfish way, just so I can sleep better at night. I say it because of all my comrades, throughout this country, and even throughout this continent (or at least up until The Wall in Mexico). Let me give you an example: we don't believe, at all, in bourgeois elections. We use it strategically to advertise our platform, our program, and receive the public fund shared by the State between all legalized parties. Do you know who are we casting as candidates for senator and governor in one of the states? [Two indigenous leaders of the region](https://www.facebook.com/pcbroraima/videos/965722563593822/). And we're not renting the party for them, they are members of the party, they attend their cell's meetings, militate in their places of work/study/living, do the grassroots work like all the others. Is that what you call doing nothing? I can assure you this is only a *tiny* fraction of all the work we do around here, in one of the 292 countries of the world.\n\nTo summarize in a very simple way the most important points: discipline yourself against Eurocentrism constantly. Do not generalize, the remedy against this is to always be minimally aware of the material and concrete reality of your own country and others. But yes, get organized. It is the best thing that can be done, and that you can do in your life. But try not to invent a new organization, the aspiring US revolutionaries have this individualistic, suicidal addiction to organize by founding one man's collective organizations. You don't need to have 100% agreement with everything about a truly revolutionary party to join their ranks, not even sit and wait until a chapter merge where you live.","created_utc":1518592252,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Also, continue to introspectively and critically flesh out your opinions and relate your class conscious discourse to the issues of gender and race which I\u2019m sure pop up more often in your group. Contribute when you feel comfortable and try and get some people to come around to revolutionary thought, maybe start them with anarchist theory cause I find that an easier bridge between liberalism and communism than Marxism is, but that all depends.

{"author":"MsExmusThrowAway","body":"I'll give you some:\n\n- Anarchism has a terrible record when it comes to anti-colonialism/anti-imperialism, especially compared to Marxism-Leninism.\n\n- Anarchism isn't rooted in a solid foundation like Marxism is. Rather than being based in a scientific understanding of the world (DiaMat/HistMat), anarchism tends to be based on board assumptions or moralism. I don't know of a single anarchist text I've read which wasn't littered with appeals to emotion as its primary method.\n\n- Because anarchists lack a scientific understanding, they tend to focus much more on \"societal deviants\" to lead the revolution. Marx and Engels designated the proletariat as the revolutionary class because 1. they were the ones on whose labor society depended, 2. the nature of their work was collective, so they were already conditioned into a collectivist mode of producing, and 3. it was in their self-interest to revolt in the name of socialism. Polyamorous vegan crustpunks (to use an example) don't fit any of these categories. Even when Mao and other anti-imperialist Marxist leaders saw the peasantry as the revolutionary subject, they pretty much held to the same criteria.\n\n- (Controversial) Speaking as someone from a South Asian Muslim background (haven't practiced in almost seven years), I can attest that many cultures outside the West do not hold to the same understanding of power and power relations as anarchists do. Of course there have been anarchist movements in the Middle East, East Asia, Africa, and so on, but anarchism's notion of why \"power\" is bad is *very* Eurocentric. To again use my own background as an example: most Muslims do not see power as an inherently destructive or negative thing. They see hierarchy as being completely justified (and by that, I mean state and government authority, bosses making profit off the labor of others, police, etc.) so as long as the people on top of said hierarchies are *virtuous*. Stuff like Privilege Theory - entirely a product of western academia which anarchists LOVE to use - is very alien to the Muslim paradigm. There is no \"white privilege\" because Islam makes us all brothers. There is no \"cis-het male\" privilege because Allah made the sexes distinct. There is no \"to be GOVERNED is to be....\" because the Prophet established a Khilafah. Again, this isn't to say Muslims can't be both Muslim and anarchist at the same time (anarchism had a strong presence in the anti-colonial struggle in Algeria, for example and also took part in the Arab Spring), but these *are* going to be ideological issues anarchists in the Muslim World will have to deal with if they're going to win the hearts and minds of the masses.\n\nI'd think of more but I'm too tired.","created_utc":1518647307,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

But, after \"conversion\" none of these people seemed to live anything close to the way I did when I lived as a conservative Muslim. They'd still drink, smoke weed, have girlfriends (who, of course, were all Arab; also take into consideration orthodox Muslims don't date unless it's for marriage), and continue living a perfectly regular western life. The point is, I've found most westerners who convert to Islam *because* of politics tend not to be very serious about it and only do it because they want \"in\" with the family. They don't understand all the obligations that others in the community will place on you, or how most Muslim cultures are very honor/shame-based (meaning, you have to control your emotions and come off as dignified all the time).

{"author":"ZombyDyno","body":"I think reading from the official dprk site is a good source of information on the country. \n\nI know some people will meet me with \"Why should we trust their government over the west's?\"\n\nWell, I think you have to look at which country has more to gain from lying about the dprk. Supposedly, the dprk gets a propaganda boost among a fringe in the first world, and further control over their situation at home (this would be the only reasonable situation following western jmperialist propaganda). I think this is a fairly unreasonable claim, due to the dprk's isolationist policy, as well as it not making a lot of sense to (if their policy was based around gathering world power or world social capital) target the fringe first world citizens that have no power to assist them by means of arms, material wealth (because their target would be the first world proletarian), etc.. I simply don't see the benefit in them doing so. This shouldn't be seen as me not understanding why they would hide human rights violations, but it makes me a little uneasy to assume that they are violating human rights (at least to the extent advertised) while pretty much every citizen has a cell phone, we can get ultra hd photos of Kim Jong Un during classified missile launches, etc., (and when met with any supposed \"evidence\" of such claims in the form of photographic evidence, usually it will have originated from chinese movies or something) without being met with an overwhelming amount of evidence to support such claims. If these claims were legitimate, there would be no way in hiding it from modern technology.  Compare this to the photographic evidence of concentration camps In nazi Germany in a time when we both didn't have such technology, and when  the western media actually propagated *for* them and didn't necessarily have incentive to denounce their developing status. \n\nOn the other hand, what does the west have to gain exactly? On top of previously having evidence for lying as a means of excusing invasion in the eyes of the core country, their expansionist policy and imperialist aims lead me to believe there is far greater incentive for the western media to lie rather than the other way around. The dprk doesn't need propaganda to support their imminent invasion of the USA or something,  as their military is significantly weaker without nuclear arms, and *with* nuclear arms, they have a no-first strike policy.  In contrast, the western powers have a much larger incentive in doing so because they have greater military power, greater political power, a wider audience, and the economic incentive for occupying the area. \n\nThis is all to say, pretty much disregard what the west says about the dprk. I would assume China has solid sources on the dprk with their Internet being joined, as well as Russia (although I'm not certain about these). The best way to analyze the dprk will probably be through their sources, as well as understanding the taenan work system and the juche ideology.

If they are correct, the person whining about \u201cmuh sectarianism\u201d should change their position and unite with the \u201csectarian.\u201d\n\n-[Bobby Whittenberg](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=338000863360837&amp;id=100014527780363)\n\n&gt;One must not allow oneself to be misled by the cry for \u201cunity.\u201d Those who have this word most often on their lips are those who sow the most dissension, just as at present the Jura Bakuninists in Switzerland, who have provoked all the splits, scream for nothing so much as for unity. Those unity fanatics are either the people of limited intelligence who want to stir everything up together into one nondescript brew, which, the moment it is left to settle, throws up the differences again in much more acute opposition because they are now all together in one pot (you have a fine example of this in Germany with the people who preach the reconciliation of the workers and the petty bourgeoisie)--or else they are people who consciously or unconsciously (like M\u00fchlberger[*], for instance) want to adulterate the movement. For this reason the greatest sectarians and the biggest brawlers and rogues are at certain moments the loudest shouters for unity. Nobody in our lifetime has given us more trouble and been more treacherous than the unity shouters.\n\n-[F. Engels](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1873/letters/73_06_20.htm), 1873.\n\n&gt;Unity is quite a good thing so long as it is possible, but there are things which stand higher than unity. And when, like Marx and myself, one has fought harder all one's life long against the alleged Socialists than against anyone else (for we only regarded the bourgeoisie as a class and hardly ever involved ourselves in conflicts with individual bourgeois), one cannot greatly grieve that the inevitable struggle has broken out.\n\n-[F. Engels](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1882/letters/82_10_28.htm), 1882.","created_utc":1518752434,"score":18,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"split_subject","body":"I do think that if you're at all uncomfortable with taking a leadership role, then you're well within reason to decline. However i do want to provide a perspective that's a little bit different from the rest of this thread. You can take it or leave it.\n\nThe best teacher is always going to be experience, so yes, it's true that men in general are going to have more difficulty \"seeing\" how women's oppression works. Men also have a strong tendency to try to talk over women and they generally do a poor job of listening when women are speaking. This is why it can be useful sometimes for men to be temporarily absent from feminist spaces. ***With that said***, in principle there is absolutely nothing stopping men from having well-formed positions on feminism and from teaching others about feminism. And it's totally possible for women to not know what the hell they're talking about. It's true that you need to be careful that you're not *unfairly* dominating the group, since there are structural reasons that might lead things to go that way. But the reality is that on certain topics at least you *may be* the most qualified person in the group to speak on it.\n\nWhen we get too tied up in who is saying what, instead of what's being said, we can run into problems. A feminist organization that doesn't encourage women to take leadership roles is of course extremely suspect. **However,** if the general level of consciousness in an organization is low, and you're the most knowledgeable person, refusing to speak or act on an issue simply because you're a man may mean that important issues just never get brought up.\n\nAdditionally, appealing to notions of who is \"allowed\" to speak for whom can be used as a cop-out. I've heard a lot of men say things like \"Oh i'm a man, i can't really speak on that\" as an excuse just not to take a position on something. I can tell you though, as a Woman\u2122, for the most part i **want** you to take a stand and have positions. While, at the end of the day, i don't actually think the success of feminism depends on whether men support it (i think collectively, women are strong enough to simply force men to acquiesce if it really comes down to it), it certainly doesn't hurt to have some men who are challenging their comrades to do better.\n\nI think what men do need to keep in mind when acting in feminist orgs is that they need to make extra effort to listen and to keep an open mind, and to not think that they know everything already. But it sounds like you're doing pretty well at that already. I can understand if you don't feel comfortable leading. Regardless of gender, you're probably right to decline if you don't think you'd be up for it. And yes, at the end of the day, the goal should be for women to be in positions of leadership. But this is just something to think about for the future: don't be afraid to speak up about stuff if you're confident you're coming from a well-informed place. The alternative might be that important topics may get put to the side or useful actions might never happen.","created_utc":1518832603,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"GenuinelyLenin","body":"&gt; Americans have become frighteningly disconnected and alone. There are fewer Americans active in any group than there were in bowling leagues alone in 1970. The many millions of loners accumulating in the U.S. since the '70s tend to experience and define their disconnection as personal. Many think it is their fault that they cannot occupy a happy place of connection in the America they imagine is still there. They imagine that other people continue to find ways to connect. They feel adrift. They can come to resent those from whom they are slipping away.\n\n\n&gt; American white men once received two wage supplements in what was a sexist and racist labor market. One wage supplement was for whiteness and the other for maleness. With the resulting \u201cfamily wage\u201d generally paid to white men, they could support a woman working full time at home, providing full maid service, sexual labor, child care, and the emotional labor of making social connections to engage the whole family with friends and relatives. With white men's family wage now largely gone, most women are now employed outside the home. They cannot, in addition, do all the housework, childcare, etc., that they did before. They want their men to share emotional and domestic burdens in the home. Yet many men want extra services at home to compensate them for their lower pay and lower status outside the home. Household tensions rise. Women are abandoning those men who cannot support them yet still demand a range of household services that employed women cannot and do not want to perform. American white men have been disempowered. They are hurting.\n\n\nDr. Harriet Fraad, [American Hyper-Capitalism Breeds the Lonely, Alienated Men Who Become Mass Killers](http://www.harrietfraad.com/american_hyper_capitalism_mass_killers) ","created_utc":1518865786,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

As a result, socialist/communist nations who have chose to antagonize the west have often found themselves unable to compete and economically exhausted.\n\nThe major exception to it all is China, whom since 1978 have used a cordial and non-confrontational attitude towards the west, emphasis upon common interests and a pragmatic tolerance of marketization in order to develop their economy.

{"author":"intlnews","body":"&gt; The U.S. should declare war on climate change and lead a new lend-lease to equip the entire world with wind turbines and expand all national industrial bases.  This will allow us to combat climate change and lead to a developed world free of unequal dominating nations and classes.  These changes can lead us to our Star Trek future and retire neoliberalism and mercantilism.\n\nBasically this is calling for futher US imperialism. Disgusting but not surprising.\n\n&gt; The US and China will compete more directly both economically and politically in the next decade.  The competition may strain American politics and change the US political balance if the US is to be more than second place to China.  The US will become second if left to its current politics and the goals of its 1%.  To compete with mercantilism, our nation needs to be organized by democratic socialism whose goal is to empower its entire people, not just the 1%.\n\nWhat the world needs is for the empire to collapse, for there to be a socialist revolution in the U$, not some hokey \"democratic socialism.\"\n\n&gt; China\u2019s accomplishments include raising more people out of poverty than any other country in human history.  China seeks to become the Middle Kingdom that it has always been in its own perception; the center with all the rest of the world at its periphery. \n\nA Middle Kingdom? Even if you say China isn't socialist, it definitely isn't a dictatorship. This is just weak reasoning.\n\n&gt; Unlike most American billionaires, China can think in terms of decades and centuries. Using its wisdom and will, China has a program to make China great again that is based on science, technology, and education.\n\nMake China great again? What the heck is that? They put in praise with \ndisgusting language. \n\n&gt; China accounts for 21 percent of the world\u2019s research and development (R&amp;D) (the comparable figure for the US is 26 percent) and China\u2019s R&amp;D is growing at 18 percent annually (the US is growing at 4 percent).  \n\nThat is impressive to say the least. Of course they downplay this.\n\n&gt; It appears that China can reverse goals quickly, as it has in reducing pollution in its capital. It did this by banning burning coal nearby and forcing many to have very cold winters.\n\nObviously this doesn't recognize that China is much more advanced in environmental matters than somewhere like the U$.\n\n&gt; Although it has a \u201ccommunist\u201d leadership, its economy is mercantilist in that its goal is to advantage itself.  This mercantilism does not endear China to all. \n\nOf course they scowl even at the idea of communism. They don't even use the word bourgeoisie here, showing the pathetic nature of their analysis.\n\n&gt; China\u2019s rise is based on education and development, as well as requiring foreign corporations to share proprietary knowledge in addition to gaining such knowledge through hacks.  China\u2019s rise might be seen when it goes to the moon, and has its own space station after the rest of the world retires our international space station.\n\nThat is not only cynical but it seems to act like most of what has happened is hype. Not sure about that or their shotty analysis.\n\n&gt; The United States\u2019 version of capitalism has as its primary goal to enrich the wealthy and let them lead.  The US has always had a reserve population that was never fully used or educated.  The US was significantly united during World War Two and at that time its reserve population began to enter the prosperous mainstream.  After the war business interests enhanced neoliberalism to move the country to be more in the service of the rich.  The US has integrated many immigrants and made advances in gender equality in the last century and is beginning to look like the world\u2019s population, but this blending is creating a backlash.  The US claims to be a democracy, but democracy depends on an inclusive and educated electorate, which is no longer a national priority.  Elections are becoming games that the rich play using money and science to bias the politics.  Our current president is slowing down education and the health of its people, thus speeding up China\u2019s rise.\n\nChina was speeding ahead with or without Trump.\n\n&gt; The height of American power was achieved during World War II.  That conflict was won by the power of US production, arms, and the Red Army.  On the home front, the US had cooperation between labor, capital, science, and government.  The US shared its production with allies using a program called Lend-Lease, which allowed sending of arms and equipment without immediate payment.  The U.S. aided the war recovery through the Marshall Plan, which speeded rebuilding.  The United Nations was created to establish world cooperation. That was then.\n\nThe Marshall Plan was anti-communist and used to bolster the capitalist poles of the world. The UN was the plaything of the imperialists at the beginning, without a doubt. Now it isn't so much anymore.\n\n&gt; An opportunity for the left today is to show that democratic socialism is not only just, but also more functional at building a strong and resourceful country than neoliberal capitalism or mercantilism. \n\nThese goofs can't even criticize capitalism itself, only the type with a descriptor in front of it. They would obviously be OK with regulated capitalism.\n\n&gt; A democratic socialist US would compete better with a mercantilist China because all our people would be able to learn and produce.\n\nThis is still capitalist thinking, embracing the idea of empire. \n\n&gt; Having a $15 minimum wage is a start to moving people out of poverty and having time for learning.  Free college with support will be required for our population to be their best.  Free continuing education is needed to keep pace with the promise and perils of automation and artificial intelligence, as technology evolves during all our work lives.  Educators must be valued and paid more to have the best minds devoted to developing our children. \n\nWith this, it wouldn't solve underlying problems. Just tying more people into the already corrupted educational system.\n\n&gt; Our education must be science-based and we need to eliminate fossil fuel corporations\u2019 ability to sabotage politics because they are too lazy to evolve their companies.  These goals need to be shared around the world. \n\nThis is so limited to be a joke. There needs to be education aimed at furthering socialist construction after a revolution, like in Juche Korea. Also, class-conscious education is important.","created_utc":1518919910,"score":24,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Raestagg","body":"I think the following excerpt from \"Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism Manual\" is on point in regards to the religion topic. The book \"Fundamentals of Marxism\u2013Leninism\" is considered one of the fundamental works on dialectical materialism and on Leninist communism. The book remains important in understanding the philosophy and politics of the Soviet Union; it consolidates the work of important contributions to Marxist theory. The book can be found[here](https://mltheory.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/fundamentals-of-marxism-leninism.pdf). On to the excerpted quote from the introduction, that touches on this, the topic of religion: \n\n\u201cMastery of the fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism requires serious and thoughtful study and, consequently, much work and time. What are the fruits of such a study?\n\nPut briefly, the answer is that it gives us an integral world outlook, the most progressive outlook of our time, one in which the cardinal components of the great teaching of Marx and Lenin are blended in a harmonious, integral system.\n\nThere are various kinds of world outlook, whether progressive or reactionary. Some of the latter are based on ancient beliefs and superstitions and seek to persuade religious-minded people that they must remain blindly dependent upon some supernatural being and his vicars and anointed regents on earth. Other philosophies, while not openly asserting the existence of a deity and even avowing faith in \u201cscience\u201d resort to subtle but false arguments in an effort to destroy man\u2019s conviction of the real existence of the material world. \n\nThat is the method used by the exponents of the most fashionable trends in modern idealism. Many of them do not themselves believe in the existence of supernatural forces but, influenced by the traditional conventions and prejudices of bourgeois society, are unwilling to close all doors against belief in the supernatural. New discoveries in science, they say, cast doubt on the materiality of nature. And the theologians and clerics support them, on the assumption that people who can be induced to believe in the non-materiality of nature are capable of believing anything. \n\nNot everything that imitates science is real science, just as not everything that glitters is gold. And particularly in our time many varieties of idealist philosophy eagerly assume a scientific guise in order to conceal their anti-scientific substance. In reality, they fear the weighty evidence of scientific facts and seek to hush up or distort these fact.\n\nMarxism-Leninism has great merits that distinguish it from all other philosophical systems. \n\nIt does not recognize the existence of any supernatural forces or creators. It rests squarely on reality, on the real world in which we live. It liberates mankind, once and for all, from superstition and age-old spiritual bondage. It encourages independent, free and consistent thought. \n\nMarxism-Leninism regards the world as it actually is, without adding an invented hell or paradise. It proceeds from the fact that all nature, including man himself, consist of matter with its different properties. \n\nNature, as well as all its individual phenomena, is in constant process of development. The laws of that development have not been ordained by God and do not depend on man\u2019s will. They are intrinsic in nature itself and are fully knowable. There are no inherently unknowable things in the world; there are only things which are still unknown, but which man will increasingly get to know.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism, Manual; Second Edition, Foreign Languages Publishing House Moscow 1963, pages 15-16.

This would be a somewhat profitable venture for you except that most banks don\u2019t even give enough to keep up with inflation\n\n3. many religions see \u201cmaking money without working for it\u201d as sinful\n\n4. No, not really. Even in the muslim world where it\u2019s technically illegal there are financial loopholes that enable people to charge interest. without interest, loans aren\u2019t worth giving, and without loans, the economy would be very different. The US government gives out interest-free student loans, but you\u2019ll rarely see something like that in the private sector.\n\n5. inflation, or rises in price level, aren\u2019t caused by interest. Its caused by the amount of money in circulation, which is a function of how much money the government physically manufactures and the buying and selling of government securities (when you buy a government bond, you take money out of circulation, causing inflation to decrease and vice versa)\n\n6. The pros are basically that it enables loans, which enables investment, which makes the economy possible. No interest means if you give out loans, you\u2019re guaranteed to lose money as someone will default sooner or later. The cons, I suppose, would be that people are often forced by economic situations into taking predatory loans with steep interest that trap them in a cycle of poverty- see Payday loans or any variation thereof.\n\n7. Highly depends on the situation but they\u2019re the ones giving loans. Sometimes they demand money back with interest, other times they demand equity in the firm.

{"author":"le_random_russian","body":"What analysis do you need, then? \n\nBelow is pretty much everything I can say about workings inside Russia, from my experiences from living here. It isn\u2019t dialectical, I think, but it may be enough for you to make a dialectical analysis of Russia\u2019s situation.\n\nBeing from intelligence agency, Putin\u2019s runs everything like he is still a head of FSB: info is on strict need-to-know basis, and blackmail material on everyone involved. \n\n\nPutin and his closest people, who are coincidentally are either in highest posts in the government or in biggest state-owned corporations, with the support of siloviki (military command) are the glue that keeps together two factions of bourgeoisie within Russia: industrial capitalists and financial capitalists. You can easily guess what those two groups want - the former wants all kinds of economic protections to sell their produce domestically, as well as preferences in exporting their goods. Latter want less borders for capital, because they are profiting from it moving either way. \n\nUntil recently, both were in precarious balance, until sanctions happened. Financists suddenly found themselves unable to borrow money abroad and selling it here in various forms of credit, living off interest. Oh, and their assets were frozen, but that\u2019s just an insult added to injury. Industrialists were hurt by this, too: not only they no longer could get necessary machines for further expansion, prices also got roughly two times more expensive then they were. Both were aslo hurt by a loss of a major trade partner: Ukraine (this whole mess is a story for another time, but what we need to know for now is that Russia had tried and failed to keep their trade partner firmly in their sphere, only maintaining their sphere in Black sea).\n\n\nThing is, both factions have different solutions to their current problems, as well as to Russian more long-term eonomic problems. Financists are aiming for possible integration either with the EU or with China, leaving Russia firmly in a position it mostly is in now - a source of raw resources for capitalist center. Industrialists push for further isolation, wishing to solve it all Keynesian way, because current situation can still benefit them if they would be able to reduce foreign presence on our markets.\n\n\nThis leaves Putin. So far, we didn\u2019t see much show in the way of infighting, apart from Khodorkovsky debacle. We can guess that after Khodorkovsky and Yukos, some kind of agreement was reached between the government and the oligarchy (which is also a good telling sign of late stage capitalism), which is something like: you accept some rules and play nice, or you will be thrown in jail or be forced to flee the country. \n\n\n\nThis leaves people. Many see it, but there is a remnant of imperial and Stalin\u2019s times in our collective psyche: people tend to believe that head of the state is a hero of the people, nearly a saint, but everyone else in the government is a bunch of crooks with the only intentions of undermining our glorious Motherland and profiting off it. Those who are agitated and wish to be politically active, are quickly channeled into conrolled opposition (Liberal-Democratic Party, \u201cCommunist\u201d Party, Party of Justice (aka socdems)) or told to \u201cbe the change you want to see\u201d and promptly incorporated into ruling party, United Russia. I didn\u2019t include Navalny and his supporters into \u201ccontrolled opposition\u201d, because the only thing that supports this point is that his rhetoric became milder over the years (he told people to go riot on the streets, burning cars and all that, in 2012, but not anymore).\n\n\nAny other opposing elements are few and far in between, stemming from unironical nazis and ancaps, to ancoms and maoists.\n\n\n","created_utc":1519039772,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

One, lying to the people about who you are, your aims, what your ideology is, etc. is a sure fire way to lose their trust, should the cat get out of the bag (the cat being out of the bag is his supposedly being a secret socialist, which seems so bizarre that it\u2019s something you\u2019d want to try and hide), and; two, Marx and Engels spoke pretty clearly on Communist behavior in the classic Manifesto, \u201cThe Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims.\u201d The last thing you want to do is deceive, lie to the very people you\u2019re trying to help. Lastly, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all seen them floating around Leftbook and other places, there are a number of polls that\u2019s been taken in the past couple years or so that show a very favorable view of life under the USSR, that things were much better.

I [wrote about this recently](https://leftistcritic.wordpress.com/2018/01/30/take-your-thorazine-the-social-democratic-nature-of-syria/) when I argued that Syria is socially democratic rather than socialist:\n\n&gt; Time and time again, Stephen Gowans, a leftist writer I profoundly respect...has said that the Syrian Arab Republic is socialist...To take his own words, he admits that Syria has never \u201cbeen a working-class socialist state\u201d but says it embodies \u201cArab socialism\"...one can surmise that social democracy aims to reform society within capitalism with \u201cpeaceful reformist work,\u201d is a bourgeois ideology connected to nationalization and social welfare programs, opposes Marxian theory at its core, stands for democracy in the \u201cname of capitalism,\u201d and is anti-revolutionary, advocating for a peaceful transition from capitalism to socialism, with markets still firmly in place...Everyone seems to acknowledge the government has a strong hand in the economy which some call \u201cstate-capitalist\u201d and others call \u201csocialist,\u201d possibly in their intentions, with some saying that the government engaged in neoliberal reforms in the 1990s...Syria has engaged in socially democratic measures as it earnestly went forward with \u201cliberalization\u201d of their economy while government control and nationalist measures were maintained to the annoyance of the IMF...Sure, the country is secular, but the policies were never really socialist despite what the study claims, even through it was anti-imperialist and anti-Zionist...The study [by the Library of Congress] seems to imply that Syria is not only not \u201csocialist\u201d but has a working bourgeoisie, although they don\u2019t call it this since the study is one assembled by bourgeois analysts, as one would expect... Syria was not, even in 1973, a truly and accurately socialist state. Rather it was a nationalist and socially democratic one which had a developed bourgeoisie which guarantees a right to inheritance, something which Marx and Engels were strongly opposed to...With all this, we can say with certainty that Syria has a developed bourgeoisie. That doesn\u2019t mean that the state cannot do good for the people of Syria, or even the proletariat, but rather that it is not socialist or on the road to socialism in any way, shape or form... Syria...is socially democratic and independent from Western influence even as it has a developed bourgeoisie...In closing, there is no doubt that Syria is a nationalist, secular and socially democratic state. But, it is not socialist, as Gowans, most prominently of all, has argued. As I\u2019ve noted in this article, Syria clearly has a bourgeoisie.\n\nI remember also reading a book about Iraq after the 2003 invasion, in which a reporter, I think for the Washington Post, claimed that the country has a centrally-planned economy and nationalized industries. I also recall that Juche Korea (DPRK) supported Iraq (Kim Il Sung was asked by Iraqi journalists about that in 1968) and then later shifted its support to Iran by the Iran-Iraq War, splitting relations and not resuming them after that point.","created_utc":1519051295,"score":10,"subreddit":"communism"}

Imagine if he saw the attack primarily as a political embarrassment to be minimized rather than as a national security threat to be combated. Imagine if he threatened to fire the investigators trying to find out what happened.\n\nUm, that's not what this is about at all. By all accounts, NO ONE has been killed by Russiagate!\n\n&gt; Imagine, moreover, if the president refused to appoint a commission to study how to safeguard America. Imagine if, as a result, we did not harden cockpit doors. If we did not create a Transportation Security Administration and a Department of Homeland Security. If we did not lower barriers between law enforcement and intelligence. If we did not pass a USA Patriot Act to enhance surveillance. And if we did not take myriad other steps to prevent another 9/11.\n\nThis logic doesn't even make sense. Enhancing the measures of a repressive national security apparatus will not and has not prevented an attack. From what I've read, it is the populace who have often warned authorities of \"suspicious\" persons, not the authorities themselves.\n\n&gt; That\u2019s roughly where we stand after the second-worst foreign attack on America in the past two decades. The Russian subversion of the 2016 election did not, to be sure, kill nearly 3,000 people. But its longer-term impact may be even more corrosive by undermining faith in our democracy.\n\nOh my. More corrosive? I think that having lobbyists give billions upon billions of dollars to further corrupt the bourgeois political system in the U$ is \"more corrosive\" than this Russiagate nonsense. The U$ has engaged in subversion which is many times worse. Just look at coups in Iran (1953), Guatemala (1954), Chile (1973), Venezuela (2002, failed), and Honduras (2009), along with the many others listed by William Blum in Rogue State.\nsubscribe\n\n&gt; The evidence of Russian meddling became \u201cincontrovertible,\u201d in the word of national security adviser H.R. McMaster, after special counsel Robert S. Mueller III indicted 13 Russians and three Russian organizations on Friday for taking part in this operation. \u201cDefendants\u2019 operations included supporting the presidential campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump (\u2018Trump Campaign\u2019) and disparaging Hillary Clinton,\u201d the indictment charges.\n\nMcMaster is a warhawk and Russophobe. He has no credibility. No one from the imperialist military has credibility on such matters. Yes, but the indictment itself basically says there has been no collusion, making the whole Russiagate thing fall apart!\n\n&gt; Yet in a disturbing weekend tweetstorm, President Trump attacked the FBI, Democrats, even McMaster \u2014 anyone but the Russians. He sought to minimize the impact of the Kremlin\u2019s intrusion, tweeting: \u201cThe results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!\u201d Actually, there\u2019s plenty of evidence of collusion, including the infamous June 2016 meeting that Trump\u2019s son, son-in-law and campaign manager held with Russian representatives who promised to \u201cincriminate\u201d Hillary Clinton.\n\nMeeting with Russians does not mean collusion. But that logic, FDR colluded with Stalin because he met with him during WWII, or Kennedy with Khrushchev, Reagan with Gorbechev, and so on. As such, this logic is so flawed, its almost hilarious. The FBI and Democrats should be slammed.\n\n&gt; There is also considerable evidence that the Kremlin impacted the election, which was decided by fewer than 80,000 votes in three states. Trump must have thought the Russian operation was significant because he mentioned its handiwork \u2014 the release of Democratic Party documents via WikiLeaks \u2014 137 times in the final month of the campaign. On top of that, Russian propaganda reached at least 126 million Americans via Facebook alone.\n\nHere we go again, saying Wikileaks is a Russian propaganda operation. That is laughable. If that has been so much the case, then Wikileaks would be in Russia. But no, Assange and other Wikileaks staff are holed up in the Ecudaorian embassy in London.  There is no \"considerable evidence.\"\n\n&gt; The onslaught did not end in 2016. Russian trolls have continued promoting hashtags such as #ReleaseTheMemo to sow dissension and division. Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats just testified that Russia \u201cviews the 2018 U.S. midterm elections as a potential target for Russian influence operations.\u201d Yet Trump has never convened a Cabinet meeting to address this threat and has resisted implementing sanctions passed by Congress.\n\nOh, so now we should trust the magical intelligence officials who say Russia is to blame. Yeah, no we shouldn't. There are no \"Russian trolls,\" that's just a way to tar people. Even though Trump has become more rabid on Russia since he got into office, what he does will never be enough for goofs like him.\n\n&gt;The president\u2019s obstructionism makes it impossible to appoint an 11/8 Commission to study this cyber-assault and to recommend responses. Various agencies, such as the FBI, are trying to combat the Russians on their own, but there is no coordinated response.\n\nThere's already an investigation by Mueller, which I'd say was totally worthless. A \"coordinated response\" would mean bringing Russophobia to new heights, which is something which should be avoided at all costs. That's because the latter will be used as an excuse to increase military spending.\n\n&gt; Much of the work has been left to social media platforms such as Google, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter that had to be dragged kicking and screaming into revealing the extent of Russian penetration, because they don\u2019t want to lose ad revenue and users. Their apathy was underscored by a Friday tweet from Facebook vice president Rob Goldman that was eagerly quoted by Trump himself: \u201cMost of the coverage of Russian meddling involves their attempt to effect the outcome of the 2016 US election. I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.\u201d That may be technically accurate as it applies to Facebook ads, but it is also highly deceptive. These ads were only a small part of a vast Russian operation utilizing hackers and trolls that, as Mueller noted, was designed to sway the election.\n\nMueller, if you believe the indictment, did not outline a vast operation. What was outlined was not vast at all.\n\n&gt; Just as Sept. 11 made clear that private security could not safeguard the aviation system, so the 2016 Russian attack made clear that social media companies cannot safeguard the electoral system. A greater federal role is needed, yet Trump refuses to even admit that the problem exists.\n\nWhy should social media companies be involved in securing the electoral system anyhow? The system is so corrupted, by money, that even federal agencies who do something \"protect it\" do not change the underlying fact of the system itself.\n\n&gt; The most benign explanation is that he is putting his vanity \u2014 he can\u2019t have anything taint his glorious victory \u2014 above his obligation to \u201cprotect and defend the Constitution.\u201d The more sinister hypothesis is that he has something to hide and, having benefited from Russia\u2019s assistance once, hopes for more aid in 2018 and 2020. Either way, we are at war without a commander in chief.\n\nWhat? He never benefited from Russia's assistance at all. If he wanted Russia's assistance he would be at Moscow right now. But no, its people like this writer, Max Boot, who want conflict  and have pushed Trump to become even more hawkish in relation to Russia and across the world as a whole. So, you could say the progressives and liberals are to blame for the warmongering and are complicit in it. Of course they won't admit that.","created_utc":1519052446,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

Not to mention that many people on here who are anti-Putin are also, hypocritically, pro-Xi Jinping - who is certainly no more of a communist than Putin!\n\nI also happen to know that outside of the Western \"left,\" that is, the labor aristocracy, much of the anti-imperialist movement throughout the world has a favorable opinion of Putin. This is the case in Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Syria, and Ukraine to name a few. I also have many Russians in my family who are anti-imperialist that love Putin. So I don't think it's as cut and dry as you all are saying. Everything consists of contradiction: Russia and Putin are no exceptions. The dialectical method requires that we analyze both aspects of a contradiction. I agree that Putin is a capitalist and that he is no communist. But I also know that he upholds the Soviet Union overall, he does embrace certain communist ideas, he is at least sympathetic to Stalin, he is supportive of various aspiring socialist and anti-imperialist states around the world, and he has been the only major force successfully confronting U.S. imperialism - which is the principal enemy of the human race. \n\n\u201cYou know that I, like millions of Soviet citizens, over 20 million, was a member of the Communist Party of the USSR and not only was I a member of the party but I worked for almost 20 years for an organization called the Committee for State Security.

I think that without this concentration of general state resources, the Soviet Union could not have prepared for war with Nazi Germany.

{"author":"CockMyBratwurst","body":"I don't pretend that there hasn't been tension between the Church and the communist movement. The Vatican even passed an edict against Communism in the early stages of the Cold War. In the same vein, I deeply resent anti-Christian (and anti-theist sentiment in general) that is widely found in many communist movements historically. Additionally, I'm a social conservative in many ways, and don't fully subscribe to the Marxian analysis of the family. I do think abortion is morally wrong, but think it should be available (and it has been proven that open access to contraception and abortion actually does lower the rate of abortion). I don't think that's that massive a jump as many socialist states of the 20th century were opposed to abortion for different reasons. Many other things, I disagree with the Church hierarchy on. \n\nHowever, the Church has been the instrument of many leftist priests in effecting and moving forward social change for the poor, and the rise of the revolutionary ideology of liberation theology and the role the Church can and must play a role in further liberating the poor and wretched of the world from poverty. Catholic clergymen were intimately involved in the Sandinista revolutionary government, and leftist movements across the global South. I think the role of the Church should be working to embrace and strengthen our understanding of the material struggle the world's poor face, because socialism is the only correct political application of Christianity. I'm glad we have a Pope today who actively promotes the idea that Communists are those who think like Christians. Historically the two have often been at odds, but I find they compliment one another more than anything. I have never felt any rift between the revolutionary doctrine of Christ and the struggle against capitalism.\n\n\"Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.\" - Matthew 19:24","created_utc":1519095057,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Comrade_Zou_Rong","body":"It's interesting that the remnants of MIM have decided to weigh in on this debate. I suppose /u/mimprisons wrote this and wants some sort of ideological exchange to take place here?\n\nI currently live in China, and I think it is socialist. I think anyone with an open mind about what socialism is supposed to *look like* could clearly see China is a socialist society. Many things happen in this country that clearly are not dictated by any *market* mechanisms. As other posters have mentioned on here, probably the most obvious piece of evidence being the television. Many TV channels are *in-your-face* with the communism. You could literally watch military civil war dramas 24 hours a day, 7 days a week if you wanted to. Why would a *capitalist regime* do this?\n\nThe schools especially are where young children here get the patriotic education. Anyone familiar with the sight of Western leftists pushing their party's newspapers at demonstrations would no doubt have their heart warmed at a similar sight in China; little kids, accompanied by their teachers/parents, selling communist newspapers to raise money for their local schools.\n\nNo one who has ever wanted to defend the idea China is a capitalist country can explain to me why the Communists in China want this stuff to be done. In their thinking, this is just some bizarre artifact of the former system, or maybe some kind of conspiracy; the Chinese capitalists that rule China *want* everyone to think it's communist, so they spend millions and millions of dollars making TV shows glorifying Mao and the communist revolution.\n\nBut anyway, there are some important things that need to be responded to, and in the spirit of *comradely* debate, I'd like to respond:\n\n&gt;We have continued to uphold that China is a majority exploited country, and an oppressed nation.\n\nHere we see MIM(prisons) blurring the lines. If we are to think in already pre-defined mental categories to *deduce* the nature of the Chinese economy (something these debates are prone to do), then where does any Marxist-Leninist thinker say that a *nation* can simultaneously be oppressed *and* imperialist? It seems to me MIM(prisons) is inventing their own ideas, or employing other mental categories outside of the Marxist-Leninist canon to reach the *idea* that a nation can simultaneously be oppressed and imperialist. Why not just give up their third cardinal principle now, and say that Euro-American workers are also an oppressed nation that is simultaneously imperialist? What observable phenomenon separates oppressor imperialist nations from oppressed imperialist nations?\n\n&gt;And its size is what allows it to have this dual character of both a rising imperialist class and a majority proletariat and peasantry. Finally, its size is part of what has allowed **an imperialist class** to rise over a period of decades while insulating itself from conflict with the outside world \u2014 both with exploiter and exploited nations.\n\nAnd here we see a total abandoning of MIM's third cardinal principle. Nations now can have an \"imperialist class\" ruling over a large majority of exploited proletarians and peasants; something their 'Maoist' co-patriots in the West already believe about the imperialist countries.\n\nThis tension between the first two cardinal principles and third has always been there in MIM's work, but it seems now that even MIM(prisons) is abandoning the third cardinal principle for easy unity with other Western 'Maoists' on the first two principles. My advice to MIM(prisons) is to realize where this ideological road will take them in the future, and to abandon it now.\n\nIn addition, I would recommend generally *de-idealizing* China's revolutionary past. I mean this in the sense of not seeing the Maoist history as the best thing communism has to offer. MIM(prisons) should reflect on the fact that Mao was a nationalist reading the works of [Wang Fuzhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Fuzhi) long before he ever became a communist. They should reflect on *why* some nationalists decide to become Marxist-Leninists and *not* others. Why was Mao elected as an alternate member of the KMT Central Executive Committee? Why did they hang up pictures of Marx, Lenin and Sun Yatsen?\n\nMarxism-Leninism in the oppressed nations of the world is *always* nationalism. Imperialism is a real economic phenomenon that has a real impact on the lives of the majority of the people of the planet, and yes, *nationalists* can see this and will *gravitate* towards the most anti-imperialist ideas they can find in the interests of *advancing* the cause of their own people. The tiny, tiny minority of people living in the advanced capitalist countries who gravitate toward Marxism-Leninism do so for *other* reasons.\n\nIn the mean time, I think MIM(prisons) should redouble their efforts at calculating imperialist surplus-value extraction. What countries are China extracting surplus-value from? How much is it? What is the size of this mysterious \"imperialist class\" that rules over a large majority of non-exploiter people in China? What exactly separates them from the majority-exploiter countries like America?\n\nUntil MIM(prisons) can give concrete answers to these questions, it would appear to me that MIM(prisons) has bowed to the ideological pressures of Western 'Maoism.' MIM(prisons) now looks like the RCP with a more nuanced line on the American labor aristocracy, which should give MIM(prisons) pause.","created_utc":1519097029,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Comrade_Zou_Rong","body":"&gt;How does this violate MIM's third cardinal?\n\nIt violates it because you offer no way of *determining* the difference between an imperialist oppressor nation and an imperialist oppressed nation. Your 'Maoist' co-patriots that you are taking your ideological lead from *already* believe this about America, Canada, Wester Europe, Japan, etc. They *already* think these countries are majority-exploited. If you can offer no way to determine the difference, you have already ideologically lost, even if you don't realize it (yet).\n\n&gt;What would an emerging imperialist power look like today, if not like China?\n\nI would imagine such a hypothetical country would have a leadership that simply didn't *care* anything about their own people, and would just cooperate as a lapdog of the Western imperialist powers. You know, like *all* of them do. The only example that seems to fit what you are talking about, in my mind, is Germany. Are you seriously suggesting China is akin to Germany in the 20s and 30s? Even here if you were, I would think you would be familiar with the work of people like G\u00f6tz Aly and his *Hitler's Beneficiaries*.\n\n&gt;U.$. hegemony cannot last forever and it is my expectation that Chinese imperialism will be playing an important role in changing that.\n\nWell, *at least* this aspect of your thinking is compatible with Marxism-Leninism. Stalin once said the Emir of Afghanistan is objectively anti-imperialist while the labor parties of the advanced capitalist countries are objectively imperialist, despite whatever else they say about socialism.\n\nBut I'm afraid my impression still stands; MIM(prisons) is now making ideological concessions to Western 'Maoism.'\n\nMy advice, as I assume you are in communication with these anonymous 'Maoists' online, is to continue pushing for concrete calculations from your 'Maoist' co-patriots. Then, when they inevitably push-back from this line of reasoning, ask yourself why. Why do they say China is imperialist but believe 99% of Americans are exploited proletarians?","created_utc":1519104967,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

The question of whether China is imperialist is, which is why we were interested in reading and reviewing that book.\n\nSome other things to clear up are definitions, at least for the benefit of other readers, these are ours:\n\n[nation](https://www.prisoncensorship.info/glossary#nation) vs. [state](https://www.prisoncensorship.info/glossary#state)\n\n[oppression](https://www.prisoncensorship.info/glossary#oppression) vs. [exploitation](https://www.prisoncensorship.info/glossary#exploitation)\n\nSo again, \n&gt;Nations now can have an \"imperialist class\" ruling over a large majority of exploited proletarians and peasants;\n\nis not new, and is therefore not a violation of the third cardinal. That said, you bring up a new point that is good:\n\n&gt;you offer no way of determining the difference between an imperialist oppressor nation and an imperialist oppressed nation.\n\nWhen we say we see China as an oppressed nation, we are talking about the *nation* being inherently allied with the international proletariat. That they are on the oppressed side of the principal contradiction. But is the Chinese nation really oppressed? China liberated itself from imperialism and still stands as an independent power. So unless one is to argue that China is a neo-colony of the U.$. or the West, then is it wrong to call it an oppressed nation?\n\nFor /u/Comrade_Zou_Rong the Chinese people are not exploited because they live in a socialist country. But for those of us who see China as capitalist, the masses of Chinese people are exploited. And it is this class character that makes us say they are in the camp of the oppressed nations. (and a cursory look at wealth, income and other social indicators easily distinguishes the class character of the Chinese masses from the majority of Amerikkkans - contrary to /u/Comrade_Zou_Rong's implications)\n\nWe already stated that for China to become an advanced imperialist country, one where the majority are net exploiters of other nations, would require China to displace the existing imperialist powers and become the global hegemonic power. So does that mean that we don't call China imperialist until that happens? Or do we look at the things that Lenin looked at and see that China is doing those things more and more over a period of decades and say that it is therefore imperialist now?","created_utc":1519149650,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"DeLaProle","body":"I remember reading an anecdote once about Paul Sweezy, the Marxian economist. He was on his way to the very small group of students to whom he taught economics. Something strange must have been going on that day though, because he could barely make it through the hall to get to the room due to a big crowd, which puzzled him. While shuffling through he finally turned and asked someone why they were all there. \"We came to see professor Sweezy's lecture.\"   \n\nThese people didn't come because Sweezy made an earth-shattering discovery, nor because he suddenly became an incredible orator. They came because something else was going on, outside of his own individual decisions: the Vietnam war. \n\nAs Lenin is reported to have said \"There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.\"  \n  \nIn a general sense you cannot debate communism into existence anymore than you can debate capitalism into existence. All of these debates are important, but not sufficient. Even the greatest orator and debater in the world is incapable of persuading the majority on these sorts of issues.

{"author":"Comrade_Zou_Rong","body":"&gt; First, i think it's interesting that this debate keeps getting framed as socialist vs. imperialist. There are reasons for this.\n\nI suspect the reason you perceive it this way is because *you* chose to attack the claim that China is socialist using a work that argues China is an imperialist country (written by people very, very concerned about maintaining their anonymity online).\n\n&gt;is not new, and is therefore not a violation of the third cardinal.\n\nAgain, you offer no way to *determine* the difference. Again, the people who wrote the book you are using believe America consists of 99% exploited proletarians. Without a mechanism of determining which one is which, the opportunist position is to simply assign this to *every* country, no matter what the political leadership says or does.\n\nMoreover, the book you are using to determine whether China is imperialist or not has no use for any of this. NB Turner and 'Maoists' like him basically think every single country in the world is 99% proletarian with a tiny class of imperialists ruling it. They would laugh at you if you seriously suggested to them America is majority-exploiter. This never enters their mind when throwing around such accusations.\n\nThey are not concerned with calculating flows of surplus-value transfer from country to country. They count the number of rich people they can find, [as if that meant anything at all](https://www.forbes.com/sites/raykwong/2011/07/25/friends-dont-let-friends-become-chinese-billionaires/). That you don't seem to understand how this is abandoning the third principle is somewhat disturbing.\n\n&gt;When we say we see China as an oppressed nation, we are talking about the nation being inherently allied with the international proletariat. That they are on the oppressed side of the principal contradiction. But is the Chinese nation really oppressed? \n\nYou do realize China is a whole bunch of different people, right? Another aspect of saying \"China is imperialist\" is backhandedly saying something like \"The Han majority oppress all the other ethnic groups in China.\" Is this something you also believe to be true? That not only their trade relationships with the outside world are imperialist in nature, but that internally the Han majority are oppressing other ethnic groups inside China (again, because \"China is imperialist\" *implies* you are also saying this).\n\n&gt;China liberated itself from imperialism and still stands as an independent power. So unless one is to argue that China is a neo-colony of the U.$. or the West, then is it wrong to call it an oppressed nation?\n\nA country can be socialist and still be losing surplus-value through exchange with other countries. In line with calculating surplus-value flows, oppressor vs oppressed should be seen in terms of surplus-value transfers. An oppressor nation is a nation which benefits from surplus-value transfer, regardless of whether or not said nation has an independent political system. In the North American context, Quebec would probably be the most instructive example of that; [MIM refused to consider the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois an oppressed nation](https://www.prisoncensorship.info/archive/etext/countries/canada/index.html) just because they are forced to remain part of Canada.\n\n&gt;For /u/Comrade_Zou_Rong the Chinese people are not exploited because they live in a socialist country.\n\nI haven't actually said that anywhere, nor do I believe it. In my mind, there is no contradiction between a country being socialist and also oppressed (again, that means they are losing surplus-value in exchanges with other countries).\n\n&gt;(and a cursory look at wealth, income and other social indicators easily distinguishes the class character of the Chinese masses from the majority of Amerikkkans - contrary to /u/Comrade_Zou_Rong's implications)\n\nYou should try explaining this to NB Turner and pals, see if they will agree with you.\n\n&gt;So does that mean that we don't call China imperialist until that happens?\n\nThat's right; until you can show they are extracting surplus-value from other countries, they're not imperialist.\n\n&gt;Or do we look at the things that Lenin looked at and see that China is doing those things more and more over a period of decades and say that it is therefore imperialist now?\n\nFirst-Worldists will look at what Lenin wrote and say that imperialism can't possibly be sustaining the lifestyles of the 'workers' in the advanced capitalist countries because FDI figures are far, far too low to account for anything.","created_utc":1519186644,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

The Nation of Islam assassinated Malcolm X, one of the greatest revolutionary figures in American history; their anger at colonisation, slavery, and white supremacy is legitimate, but their political beliefs and practice are wrong and counter-revolutionary reaction. He was a CIA-sponsored reactionary fascist, at best motivated by national liberation but going about it in a completely fucked way.\n\nT'Challa didn't really have his politics positively asserted at any point (because this movie was made for profit and so the protagonists can't have controversial political viewpoints), but it's easy to put him as a black nationalist or a Pan-African socialist, aside from the monarchism that he's shown to have significant issues with. He could be a black bourgeois liberal, it's sort of left open-ended.\n\nObviously the movie was made for profit, and the CIA edited the script to make it friendlier to them. It's not a communist movie. But I don't think it's got the message y'all are saying, and I think given how incredibly popular it is it's worth understanding it honestly to be able to better explain what the socialist position is if you know people around you have been influenced by it.

{"author":"intlnews","body":"&gt; While gun control has spiralled into a raging debate between those who support individual ownership of weapons and those against it, there has been no discussion on communal armament. Firearms under socialism, must be communal property of any mass organizations (like workers' councils) the use of which is regulated by the councils themselves. Individual ownership of arms is bound to channel some arms into the hands of counter-revolutionaries, which is definitely not what socialism aims to do, considering we have enough threats already.\n\nThat sounds like a good idea to communally control arms.

{"author":"aldo_nova","body":"Trotsky exiled from Soviet Russia: here is an event to which international revolutionary opinion cannot become easily accustomed. Revolutionary optimism never admitted the possibility that this revolution would end, like the French, condemning its heroes. But what in good sense should not have been expected is that the task of organizing the first great socialist state would be fulfilled with unanimous agreement, without debate or violent conflicts, by a party of more than a million impassioned militants.\n\n Trotskyist opinion has a useful role in Soviet politics. It represents, if one wishes to define it in two words, Marxist orthodoxy, confronting the overflowing and unruly current of Russian reality. It exemplifies the working-class, urban, industrial sense of the socialist revolution. The Russian revolution owes its international, ecumenical value, its character as a precursor of the rise of a new civilization, to the ideas that Trotsky and his comrades insist upon in their full strength and import. Without vigilant criticism, which is the best proof of the vitality of the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet government would probably run the risk of falling into a formalist, mechanical bureaucratism.\n\n But, to this point, events have not proven Trotskyism correct from the point of view of its ability to replace Stalin in power with a greater objective capacity to realize the Marxist program. The essential part of the Trotskyist opposition's platform is its critical part. But in the estimation of those elements who might plot against Soviet policies, neither Stalin nor Bukharin is very far from subscribing to most of the fundamental concepts of Trotsky and his adepts. The Trotskyist proposals and solutions, on the other hand, do not have the same solidity. In most of what relates to agrarian and industrial policies and the struggle against bureaucratism and the NEP spirit, Trotskyism tastes of a theoretical radicalism that has not been condensed into concrete and precise formulas. On this terrain, Stalin and the majority, along with having the responsibility for administration, have a more real sense of the possibilities.\n\n The Russian revolution, which, like any great revolution, advances along a difficult path that it clears with its own impetus, has not yet known easy or idle days. It is the work of heroic and exceptional men, and for this very reason has only been possible through the greatest and most tremendous creative tension. The Bolshevik Party, therefore, neither is nor can be a peaceful and unanimous school. Lenin imposed his creative leadership until shortly before his death, but not even with this extraordinary leader's immense and unique authority were violent debates unusual inside the party. Lenin gained his authority with his own strength; he later maintained it through the superiority and perspicacity of his thought. His points of view always prevailed because they best corresponded to reality. Many times, though, they had to defeat the resistance of his own lieutenants of the Bolshevik old guard.\n\n Lenin's death, which left vacant the post of creative leader with immense personal authority, would have been followed by a period of profound disequilibrium in any party less disciplined and organic than the Russian Communist Party. Trotsky stood out from all his comrades because of the brilliant distinctiveness of his personality. But he not only lacked a solid and long-standing connection with the Leninist team. His relationship with the majority of its members had been quite uncordial before the revolution. Trotsky, as is well known, had an almost individual position among Russian revolutionaries until 1917. He did not belong to the Bolshevik Party, whose leaders, even Lenin himself, polemicized bitterly with him more than once. Lenin intelligently and generously appreciated the value of collaborating with Trotsky, who himself -- as the volume of his writings on the revolution's leader attests -- unreservedly and unjealously respected an authority consecrated by the most inspiring and enthralling work of revolutionary consciousness. But if almost all the distance between Lenin and Trotsky could be erased, the identification between Trotsky and the party itself could not be equally complete. Trotsky could not count on the full confidence of the party, as much as his performance as people's commissar merited unanimous admiration. The party machinery was in the hands of members of the old Leninist guard, who always felt themselves a bit distant from and alien to Trotsky, who, for his part, was not able to fully join them in a single bloc. Moreover, Trotsky, it seems, does not possess the special talents of a politician as Lenin did to the greatest degree. He does not know how to gather men; he is not acquainted with the secrets of managing a party. His singular position -- equidistant from Bolshevism and Menshevism -- during the years between 1905 and 1917, besides disconnecting him from the revolutionary team that prepared and realized the revolution with Lenin, must have disaccustomed him to the concrete practice of a party leader.\n\n As long as the mobilization of all revolutionary energies against the threats of reaction continued, Bolshevik unity was ensured by the pathos of war. But once the work of stabilization and normalization began, the discrepancies between individuals and tendencies had to manifest themselves. The lack of an exceptional personality like Trotsky would have reduced the opposition to more modest terms. In this case, it would not have come to a violent schism. But with Trotsky at the command post, the opposition quickly took an insurrectionary and combative tone to which the majority and the government could not be indifferent.\n\n Trotsky, moreover, is a man of the cosmopolis. Zinoviev, at another moment during a Communist congress, accused him of ignoring and neglecting the peasant. He has, in any case, an international sense of the socialist revolution. His notable writings on the transitory stabilization of capitalism are among the most alert and sagacious criticisms of the era. But this very international sense of the revolution, which gives him such prestige on the world scene, momentarily robs him of his power in the practice of Russian politics. The Russian revolution is in a period of national organization. It is not a matter, at the moment, of establishing socialism internationally, but of realizing it in a nation that, while a nation of 130 million inhabitants that overflows onto two continents, does not yet constitute a geographical and historical unit. It is logical that in this stage, the Russian revolution is represented by men who more deeply sense its national character and problems.\n\n Stalin, a pure Slav, is one of these men. He belongs to a phalanx of revolutionaries who always remained rooted in the Russian soil, while Trotsky Radek, and Rakovsky belong to a phalanx that passed the larger part of their lives in exile. They were apprenticed as international revolutionaries in exile, an apprenticeship that has given the Russian revolution its universalist language and its ecumenical vision. For now, alone with its problems, Russia prefers more simply and purely Russian men.\n\n The Russian revolution finds itself in a necessary period of prudence. Trotsky, personally disconnected from the Stalinist team, is an excessive figure on the stage of national achievement. One imagines him destined to carry the socialist gospel in triumph through Europe, with Napoleonic energy and majesty, at the head of the Red Army. It is not as easy to conceive him filling the modest role of minister in normal times. The NEP condemns him to return to his belligerent position as polemicist.","created_utc":1519322408,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Comrade_Zou_Rong","body":"What a strange state of affairs that 'Maoists' in North America feel very compelled to denounce China recently.\n\nAnyway, reading this screed seems like a compilation of anti-China resources that the author thought would influence people.  One thing I find revealing is how they talk about \"labor activists\" without mentioning these people are almost always funded by Western labor unions. One of the links is to the China Labor Bulletin, an outfit created by [Han Dongfang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Dongfang), who openly receives money from the National Endowment for Democracy.\n\nThat the MCP-OC does these things without informing their readers shows either political naivety and/or outright dishonesty. Most people who would seriously be into revolution in North America undoubtedly already know about the nature of the Western imperialist labor unions. Indeed, there is a decades long history of openly funding reactionary \"labor activists\" on the part of the imperialist Western labor unions like the AFL-CIO and the ITUC. Many books have been written on this subject, one of the better ones (IMHO) being Thomson and Larson's *Where were you, brother? An account of trade union imperialism* (there is a pdf floating around somewhere on the internet, if you know where to look. If you can't find it, I believe I have a copy, and you can PM me if you're interested).\n\nSo the serious reader should asks themselves why the MCP-OC fails to mention this. The answer is either they don't know, don't care, or both.\n\nSimilar remarks could be made for many of the other links, but I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to spot them.\n\nEdit: The book was posted to this very subreddit about a year ago:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/5o3qcc/where_were_you_brother_an_account_of_trade_union/","created_utc":1519359979,"score":19,"subreddit":"communism"}

Zuma\u2019s inglorious exit from power is fitting punishment for his treacherous betrayal of the African working class...Zuma skillfully and opportunistically rode the wave of anger of the working class and the disgruntled aspiring African capitalists to ascend to power. We were not blind to the personal weaknesses of Jacob Zuma...Zuma was barely in office when, in 2012, it became very clear to us that neither the neoliberal policies nor corruption and all the rot which combined these two capitalist evils can unleash on any country, were abating under Zuma...we called for Zuma\u2019s immediate resignation and separated from the ANC led alliance...We were hounded out of COSATU...Meanwhile, Zuma and his friends...systematically went ahead to dismantle the coalition of left forces that had facilitated his rise to power, and ensconced himself with the now extremely infamous Gupta gang...We are pleased to say that our Marxist-Leninist analysis was correct. He is alone and isolated has been relegated to the dustbin of history, where he belongs...the working class must remain vigilant. Ramaphosa as president is not a victory for workers. We must expect a more diligent, effective and ruthless pursuit of neoliberal capitalist policies by the ANC government.

He will personally drive privatization...Radical Economic Transformation will continue to be a myth, despite the desperate need to transform the economy to benefit the working class majority.

We need to do better.\n\nI have not committed any ad hominem fallacies, which consist of dismissing a person's argument based on some personal feature. I have refuted your arguments with sources, and then pointed out your dishonesty. That is not ad hominem.\n\nThe point of the first link is that an armed guard did not do his job. So it didn't work.\n\nFrom the second link: \"But having armed security on-site failed to prevent the deadliest mass shooting at an American high school.\"\n\nThe refutes your reasoning that armed guards are the solution to stopping school gun violence.

Most of them are white. But they are also many multinationals with shareholders all over the world who have never touched the land.

What about Cyril's own profiteering from land while only 8% of disadvantaged south africans saw some form of land reform since 1994? he is part of a Stud Game Breeders auction consortium, made up of himself and five white dudes. Just last year they made R116million in livestock sales, including from Cyril's own private game farm - which I can guarantee you he only allows rich (probably tourists) bourgies to frequent and \"utilize\" (hunting, safaris, etc etc), and not his fellow African's to even practice subsistence farming.\n\nI've mentioned before in other comments on this post, this is nothing new for the ANC, and especially not during the year leading up to an election the ANC is set to do their worst yet because of public distrust. Cyrils budget is anti poor, and because the poor is in vast majority non-white, it is anti-black as well. Cuts to basic education will ruin the already fragile rural schools, increases in value added tax and fuel levies will cripple already struggling households. meanwhile there is no increases in high incomes and capital gains taxes. his minimum wage and ammended labour laws will see labour being the most disenfranchised it has been since the fall of apartheid. he has to say something the appease the struggling masses, and land redistribution is an easy and emotionally charged issue where he can continue to justify the slow progress that the ANC has made on this very topic with talks such as \"its complicated, we need to do it responsibly, we can't threaten food security, etc etc\".

Meeting a concept through an introductory medium that prompts you to delve deeper into an area is how most people got to understanding communism in the first place. Except what usually happens if you only recommend some quick internet rundown or Wikipedia page and deprecate primary sources is people do what they usually do: get remiss and *only* watch YouTube videos and read Wikipedia pages. And lectures can be just as rife with misinterpretations as any other modern source.\n\n&gt;Not all people learn the way you do, or I do, we must endeavor to work with how people learn best, and sometimes that's not reading.\n\n*Most* people *can* learn from reading, though. Like it's a ridiculously high proportion of the population that can do this. And it's not about learning best; you can read at whatever pace pleases you. You can listen to an audiobook. But since Marx and Engels and every other communist in history recorded their thoughts on paper, that about exhausts the ways to absorb their actual ideas. Anything else is *not* their ideas, but someone else's interpretation *of* them, which, with rare exceptions, are in some way inaccurate. The measure of modern interpretations of Marxism that actually get it right is small enough that you'd just be better off actually reading Marxist literature from the start. Nevermind the fact that the OP literally asked for books they should recommend, so it's safe to assume this person, like almost everyone else, can learn fine by reading.\n\n&gt;David Harvey has one for Capital that's great. \n\n*sigh* Case in point. It's almost like puzzle pieces at this point. People don't want to put in the work to read Marx -&gt; resort to David Harvey, whose explication of *Capital* is famously bad.\n\nEdit: And, having just watched Crash Course Sociology's introduction to Marx, as well as that of Philosophy Tube, you, as I have said, are right that those are somewhat decent introductions. But they in no way replace actually learning about communism. Relying on them will just leave you with a bunch of unanswered questions and half-understandings that, if you don't follow up with more thorough learning, will fester into the terrible misunderstandings of communism that make up most of the left. Integral pieces like alienation, value, dialectics, and the premise of communism, what communist materialism is--as against the vulgar materialism of Ludwig Feuerbach, for instance--seem to be ignored. And if you went by the name of the Crash Course video, you'd think communism is compatible with sociology, or that Marx was a sociologist. The same goes for Philosophy Tube and philosophy. Marx was neither a philosopher nor a sociologist, and failing to grasp this--and one would grasp it if they read any from the number of Marx's works in which he makes this clear--is to fail to grasp communism.","created_utc":1519541720,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

Italy is the big loser of the process of European economic integration: what do you want the Italian people to do?\n\nThe European Union is a project meant to benefit the financial elite at the expense of working classes. The ECB is a private indipendent Central Bank upon which democratically elected governments have no say.\nThe European commission works much in the same way.\nLeftists should begin to realize that the European Union is crushing the unprivileged classes instead of fearing the return of fascism in 2018. \n\n","created_utc":1519557457,"score":-12,"subreddit":"communism"}

It even says that the students had control of the protests over the workers and hated the peasant masses, both correct observations.

{"author":"DeLaProle","body":"I don't think there's anything the US can do to stop mass shootings. Or at least nothing the US ruling class would find economically or politically acceptable. In fact the US might even use this *new normal* as a justification, like with terrorism, for greater domestic militarization in the face of a crumbling empire.  \n  \nIf the US was actually interested in addressing this problem it would adopt a functioning healthcare system (mental health included) and overcome this crisis of investment in order to end the decades of wage stagnation (things like paid sick days/vacation would help too). Finally it would need to confront its culture of toxic, hyper-individualistic masculinity. Can you think of a scenario in which the US would do such a thing? The last time the US did any economic reforms on any substantial level was during the New Deal and that required a great depression, a world war, and a global communist movement.  \n  \nI think it's more likely that this new normal just produces and reproduces ineffective legislation like outlawing AR-15s (then chasing the next popular basically identical semi-auto rifle like whack-a-mole) while building up the security state. edit: The only way I can see anything even close to helpful happening is if the people who are actually outraged at these massacres stop letting the democratic party sap their energy with the logic that the democratic party is the good side that would save us if it weren't for the evil republicans thwarting the former's plans.

I did search for Czechoslovakia on the site of the Marxists Internet Archive but only had mixed results, the best of which is shown above. I wish I could have found documents from the Czechoslovakians themselves but I haven't found those yet.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party, in outlining their anti-revisionist arguments [in March 1964 opposing Khruschev's revisionism](https://www.marxists.org/history/international/comintern/sino-soviet-split/cpc/prolrev.htm), wrote about Czechoslovakia \n\n&gt; Furthermore, they [Communist Party of the Soviet Union] allege that the working class of Czechoslovakia won \"power by the peaceful road\". This is another absurd distortion of history.\nThe people's democratic power in Czechoslovakia was established in the course of the anti-fascist war; it was not taken from the bourgeoisie \"peacefully\". During World War II, the Communist Party led the people in guerrilla warfare and armed uprisings against the fascists, it destroyed the German fascist troops and their servile regime in Czechoslovakia with the assistance of the Soviet Army and established a national front coalition government. This government was in essence a people's democratic dictatorship under the leadership of the proletariat, i e., a form of the dictatorship of the proletariat.\nIn February 1948 the reactionaries inside Czechoslovakia, backed by U.S. imperialism, plotted a counter-revolutionary coup d'\u00e9tat to overthrow the people's government by an armed rebellion. But the government led by the Communist Party immediately deployed its armed forces and organized armed mass demonstrations, thus shattering the bourgeois plot for a counter-revolutionary come-back. These facts clearly testify that the February event was not a \"peaceful\" seizure of political power by the working class from the bourgeoisie but a suppression of a counter-revolutionary bourgeois coup d'\u00e9tat by the working class through its own state apparatus, and mainly through its own armed forces.\n\nThere have also been comments about Czech Republic on this forum [here](http://reddit.com/r/communism/comments/11k7wu/communists_win_local_czech_election/), [here](http://reddit.com/r/communism/comments/1p2mg9/back_to_the_future_communist_party_may_gain_power/), and [here](http://reddit.com/r/communism/comments/6nornb/who_to_vote_for_in_the_czech_republic/). \n\nI hope this helps, OP.","created_utc":1519676198,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

The two have their own take on actually-existing socialism (\"Soviet state capitalism\") that is unoriginal, unsurprising, and dangerous for anyone engaging in history or building socialism.\n\nThis latter side of Wolff is what bleeds into his popular work. As you know he's a big proponent of co-ops. He'll say shit like \"there's already a concrete example of communism working in the U.S.\". He thinks that, while the Soviet experience proved the worth of central planning, it was \"unbalanced\" by a lack of decentralization (lack of co-ops). Whether or not co-ops are a potentially revolutionary reform for the core is up for debate but his treatment of the question is so metaphysical that he's often confused and contradictory. In any case I think his current self has a certain popular utility that will run dry quickly if this god-forsaken country ever even gets to the point of engaging in his proposals seriously.\n\nWhether or not he's self-aware of his limitations is irrelevant to my point.

They argue as follows: \u201cWhat sort of state is the Soviet government building? The Communists say they are building a communist state and assure us that the new policy is a matter of tactics: the Bolsheviks are making use of the private capitalists in a difficult situation, but later they will get the upper hand. The Bolsheviks can say what they like; as a matter of fact it is not tactics but evolution, internal regeneration; they will arrive at the ordinary bourgeois state, and we must support them. History proceeds in devious ways.\u201d\n\n&gt;Some of them pretend to be Communists; but there are others who are more straightforward, one of these is Ustryalov. I think he was a Minister in Kolchak\u2019s government. He does not agree with his colleagues and says: \u201cYou can think what you like about communism, but I maintain that it is not a matter of tactics, but of evolution.\u201d I think that by being straightforward like this, Ustryalov is rendering us a great service. We, and I particularly, because of my position, hear a lot of sentimental communist lies; \u201ccommunist fibbing\u201d, every day, and sometimes we get sick to death of them. But now instead of these \u201ccommunist fibs\u201d I get a copy of _Smena Vekh_, which says quite plainly: \u201cThings are by no means what you imagine them to be. As a matter of fact, you are slipping into the ordinary bourgeois morass with communist flags inscribed with catchwords stuck all over the place.\u201d This is very useful. It is not a repetition of what we are constantly hearing around us, but the plain class truth uttered by the class enemy. It is very useful to read this sort of thing; and it was written not because the communist state allows you to write some things and not others, but because it really is the class truth, bluntly and frankly uttered by the class enemy. \u201cI am in favour of supporting the Soviet government,\u201d says Ustryalov, although he was a Constitutional-Democrat, a bourgeois, and supported intervention. \u201cI am in favour of supporting Soviet power because it has taken the road that will lead it to the ordinary bourgeois state.\u201d","created_utc":1519701471,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

All the policemen take your guns off\u2014I don't want more than two of you in the whole city. Muhammad Ali's coming!' 'They just took you where they wanted to go.' I know that's a lie. I got in my car and told my driver where to go. Lying about the Russians. I jogged in the mornings in strange places where they hardly ever saw a Black man. I ran past two little white Russian ladies who were walking to work. They didn't look around and ask what I was doing. I can't go jogging in some streets in America in the morning in a white neighborhood. If they see a Black man coming down the street, they wonder who I'm going to jump. I love things like this that I notice. Late at night, I was running down the street, and I looked back. Again, there were two Russian ladies. They didn't even look back to see why a Black man was out here running.","created_utc":1519748383,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"xplkqlkcassia","body":"&gt;I don't think it's that simple. Capitalists use the same world bank figures to say capitalism has pulled millions out of poverty by simply changing what the qualifications of poverty are. So then over night, hundreds of millions are pulled out of poverty. We can't tell capitalist sympathizers that their methodology is flawed but used that same methodology to brag about China. Pick one or the other.\n\nThis was the case with the World Bank's redefinition of poverty in the Millenium Development Goals from $1.02 (at 1985 PPP) to $1.08 (at 1993 PPP), but not the case with the figures presented in news_bot's article, nor the case with how the PRC assesses its own national poverty. The World Bank, in their assessment of China's progress in eliminating poverty, set the poverty line at US$1.90 or less per day at 2011 PPP, from which there was a massive reduction of 88 percent in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 2012.\n\nChina's methodology is much more conservative and much more pragmatically-inclined, in comparison to the WB which is focused on glamourising the international capitalist order to pave the way for predatory neoliberal restructuring of national economies. China has a poverty line based on income for counties  (&gt;2% of the population earning 2,300 yuan at 2010 prices) which varies from region to region in accordance with factors such as cost of living, rate of urbanisation, etc. In addition to their income-based poverty line, they also go around to each village and *ask* their residents whether they feel they have genuinely been lifted out of poverty. There are several other qualifications, such as accessibility of medical care, potable water, electricity, and tertiary education. And even the PRC's national poverty line indicates [that poverty now only affects 2% of China's population](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-01/05/c_136874603.htm), a 2/3 reduction from five years ago.\n\nThis is much more in-depth because while the WB only needs to maintain the facade that capitalism has been reducing poverty (it hasn't) by publishing glittering yearly reports without handling the difficult task of directly reducing poverty, the CPC has made an ironclad commitment to produce an evenly-developed, prosperous socialist society by 2049 and needs to keep its head out of the clouds.\n\nWe should be promoting the success of China's poverty campaign as an excellent example of what socialist economic planning can accomplish.","created_utc":1519763305,"score":16,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Ali_Is_The_GOAT","body":"Between the summer of 1936 and 1938, the regime of Joseph Stalin summarily executed 750,000 Soviet citizens without trial or any legal process.\n\nIn the same period, more than a million others were sent to the labour camps of the Gulag, from where many would not return. In the history of a murderous regime, this was a period of exceptional state violence perpetrated against its own people.\n\nThe episode has always held a certain macabre fascination, but there are other more substantial reasons for drawing attention to it as we reach the 80th anniversary. In 1991, and then again in 2000, huge volumes of archival materials \u2014 millions of documents \u2014 were released to historians.\n\nIt has taken years to digest this material and make sense of it, but new and striking findings have made it possible to rewrite the history of what has come to be know as the Terror, or the Great Purge. My recent book The Great Fear is one example of this. These findings help us better understand contemporary Russia, its current, authoritarian leader and the reverence many Russians continue to feel for Stalin.\n\nIn the West, the public perception of Stalin and the Terror lingers from the period immediately after the dictator\u2019s death in 1953. His successor, Nikita Khrushchev, wanted to limit the power of the fearsome Soviet political police. But he also wanted to communicate to the Soviet political elite that they would not be blamed for the violence of the Stalin era, though they had been deeply and directly involved. So Khrushchev blamed the Terror on Stalin and his \u201ccult of personality\u201d, and historians in the West followed his lead.\n\nThey \u2013 particularly following the lead of Robert Conquest in his 1967 book The Great Terror \u2013 presented Stalin as a bloodthirsty, paranoid, political opportunist determined to secure total power over all other considerations. The Terror of 1936-1938 was therefore understood as the culmination of a drive to create a personal dictatorship.\n\nNew perspectives\nArchival revelations have not, it must be said, established that Stalin was actually a nice guy. Quite the contrary. But they have poked rather large holes in the traditional story.\n\nFor example, it became clear rather early on that the majority of victims of the Terror were ordinary workers and peasants \u2014 people who presented no challenge to Stalin\u2019s power. When Stalin\u2019s private papers were released in 2000, historians initially expected to see a gap between them and Stalin\u2019s public self-presentation as a loyal follower of Lenin and defender of the Revolution. But it wasn\u2019t there. In public and in private, Stalin was committed to building socialism, not to building a personal dictatorship for its own sake.\n\nSo what was the motivation behind the Terror? The answers required a lot more digging, but it gradually became clearer that the violence of the late 1930s was driven by fear. Most Bolsheviks, Stalin among them, believed that the revolutions of 1789, 1848 and 1871 had failed because their leaders hadn\u2019t adequately anticipated the ferocity of the counter-revolutionary reaction from the establishment. They were determined not to make the same mistake.\n\nSo they created elaborate systems for gathering information on external and internal threats to their revolution. But those systems were far from perfect. They painted threats in far darker colours than was warranted. For example, the Bolsheviks spent much of the 1920s and 1930s anticipating invasion from coalitions of hostile capitalist states \u2014 coalitions that did not exist. Other perceived threats were also exaggerated beyond all proportion: scheming factions, disloyal officials, wreckers, saboteurs.\n\nMany of these \u201cthreats\u201d were products of Stalin\u2019s overambitious plans. He had demanded 100% fulfilment of production targets that could not be met, and he and his colleagues in the Kremlin misinterpreted the resultant dissent, resistance and breakdowns as evidence of counter-revolutionary conduct. And certain workers and peasants \u2013 who had reason to resent the regime \u2013 were viewed as dangerous potential recruits to this fictional counter-revolution.\n\n\nGreat fear\nBy the mid-1930s, the rise of the Nazis in Germany and the militarists in Japan, both stridently anti-communist, posed a very real threat to the USSR. War was then on the horizon, and Stalin felt he had no choice but to take preemptive action against what he saw as a potential fifth column \u2013 a group that would undermine the larger collective.\n\nThe resultant maelstrom of violence massively weakened the USSR rather than strengthening it, but the ultimate victory of Soviet forces in World War II appeared to justify the Terror. And the emergent Cold War seemed to justify the view that the capitalist world would stop at nothing to undermine Soviet power.\n\nThe Soviet political police, renamed the KGB in 1954, never recognised the monstrous crimes that they had contributed to under Stalin\u2019s direction. They perceived themselves as heroes of the story, brilliantly anticipating and intercepting the evil deeds of the regime\u2019s enemies.\n\nVladimir Putin, the president of Russia, rose from the ranks of the KGB in the 1970s. He was trained in its methods and steeped in its mentality. While one should not leap to the conclusion that he is a prisoner of his early career, the echoes of KGB (and Stalin\u2019s) thinking are present in the messages delivered relentlessly by the state-controlled media.\n\nThe population is told that the US and EU want to reduce Russia to the status of a third-rate power, to take control over her resources and subvert her values. Putin does not propose officially to rehabilitate the figure of Stalin, but he does little to challenge the public presentation of his predecessor as someone who made Russia a great power, and who stood up to the West.\n\nToday we better understand the exaggerated fears that sparked the paroxysm of state violence that was the Great Terror. But in Russia, the echoes of those same fears prevent an open discussion of Stalin\u2019s crimes, and serve to reinforce Putin\u2019s authoritarianism.","created_utc":1519774955,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

Putin of course was only ever affiliated with the KGB, and judging by his actions in life (especially the times he has held political power), I would say there is little to no connection between Putin and Stalin, and that trying to draw a connection between them is little more than typical McCarthyist red-scare tactics. I\u2019m not knowledgeable enough about the differences between the old secret police (NKVD and then the MVD - correct me if I\u2019m wrong) and the KGB, but presumably some functional changes were made outside of just changing the names, making that connection between Stalin and Putin through the KGB even more questionable.

{"author":"intlnews","body":"Full speech by Raul Castro reprinted:\n\nSpeech by Army General Ra\u00fal Castro Ruz, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba and President of the Councils of State and Ministers, in the tribute ceremony held in the Capitolio building, February 24, 2018, \u201cYear 60 of the Revolution\u201d\n\nCompa\u00f1eras and compa\u00f1eros:\n\nToday, February 24, we celebrate the 123rd anniversary of the resumption of our War of Independence called for by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed.\n\nThe profound significance of this date marked the maturity and the crystallization of the project proposed by Mart\u00ed, who in order to lead it and to make it happen, founded the Cuban Revolutionary Party.\n\nWhen everything seemed lost, his ability to find an alternative and overcome any setback, led him to summon the people to a definitive effort: the war that he believed necessary when he thought it unavoidable. He continually called for national unity, articulating the best traditions of the past, without overlooking all those who were willing to sacrifice and give their lives for a greater cause.\n\nA month later, on March 25, 1895, in Montecristi, the Dominican Republic, Mart\u00ed, along with Major General M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez, signed the Manifesto which set out the scope and aims of the struggle. Together they left for Cuba to join the liberation struggle, landing at Playitas de Cajobabo on April 11, just like Major General Antonio Maceo had done a few days before at Duaba.\n\nAs Fidel stated on the 100th anniversary of the Ten Years War, \u201cMart\u00ed gathered up the flags of C\u00e9spedes, Agramonte, and the heroes that fell in that struggle and led Cuba\u2019s revolutionary ideas in that period to their highest expression.\u201d\n\nThere is no better moment than this to award the honorific title of Hero of Labor of the Republic of Cuba \u2013 in fitting recognition of a lifetime of work committed to the Revolution \u2013 to three brave compa\u00f1eros who already hold the honorable title of Heroes of the Republic of Cuba. I am referring to Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Machado Ventura and Comandantes of the Revolution Ramiro Vald\u00e9s Men\u00e9ndez and Guillermo Garc\u00eda Fr\u00edas.\n\nAs for Machado Ventura, I could highlight that he joined the struggle against the tyranny as a medical student at the University of Havana, and 65 years ago he participated in the first March of the Torches, in January 1953.\n\nIn 1957 he joined the Rebel Army in the Sierra Maestra and served as a doctor and guerilla fighter in various battles. He was a founder of the Second Front; and organized and led the Military Health Department until the end of the struggle, where he was wounded in combat. He developed a broad network of field hospitals and dispensaries which not only offered services to combatants but also, and most importantly, the area\u2019s population, who in many places had never seen a doctor before.\n\nAfter the triumph of the Revolution he was appointed Head of Medical Services of Havana and of the FAR(Revolutionary Armed Forces) and later Minister of Public Health.\n\nHe is a founder of the Communist Party of Cuba and in 1975 was elected as a member of the Political Bureau. He was First Party Secretary in various provinces.\nSince 2011, he has served as second secretary of the Central Committee. He is a vice president of the Councils of State and Ministers.\n\nRamiro Vald\u00e9s Men\u00e9ndez joined the revolutionary struggle at a young age. He participated in the March of the Torches in January 1953 and in the attacks on the Moncada Garrison that same year, during which he was injured. He was imprisoned on the Isle of Pines and lived in exile in Mexico, where he joined the Granma expedition.\n\nHe was involved in multiple battles in the Sierra Maestra, and participated alongside Che in the invasion of the West as second commander of the Ciro Redondo Column No. 8.\n\nSince the triumph of the Revolution he has occupied important posts, including Minister of the Interior on two occasions, and as a vice president of the Councils of State and Ministers, a position which he currently holds. He is a member of the Party Political Bureau.\n\nA lot more can be said about each one of these figures on this occasion, but in the case of Ramiro, I have always admired him because he is the only one of us who \u2013 in addition to those actions taken some months before Moncada, during which we marched in the first March of the Torches led by Fidel 65 years ago \u2013 was wounded in the taking of the main post during the Moncada assault; where he was shot in the heel with the bullet lodging itself in his foot. When we met up, or when we were brought together again at the Vivac (prison) in Santiago de Cuba, he showed me his blood-stained socks, but said he didn\u2019t know where the bullet was. The years went by and he began to limp in the Sierra Maestra because of a callus he had on the sole of his foot. On various occasions he was unable to continue marching with the rest of the initial group of the liberation war, until one day, he began to scrape away at the callus with his own knife until the bullet of the Moncada attack appeared, shot by an enemy as he fell to the ground mortally wounded.\n\nThere are dozens or hundreds of heroic feats or important acts linked to each one, and which of course were not even recorded in the few campaign diaries that were written. What is more, unlike the rest of us in the liberation war, Ramiro had the good fortune and honor of being the second commander of the Column led by Che to Las Villas.\n\nGuillermo Garc\u00eda Fr\u00edas, who recently celebrated his 90th birthday, organized a network of campesinos to help the Granma expeditionaries and take them to the Sierra Maestra. An astute man, he personally led Fidel and the other combatants to Cinco Palmas and recovered various rifles.\n\nHe was the first campesino to join the Rebel Army, with an outstanding record, first as a combatant and later as second commander of the Third Front when it was founded in early March 1958, led by then Comandante Juan Almeida.\n\nThere are hundreds of anecdotes about Guillermo; of the early days and following the Granma landing, we will only touch on some aspects. It was he who led Fidel and two other compa\u00f1eros, Faustino P\u00e9rez \u2013 who was a doctor \u2013 and Universo S\u00e1nchez, one of which was unarmed having left his rifle behind on treating the wounded in the first clash at Alegr\u00eda de P\u00edo.\n\nThat is to say that Fidel arrived to the Sierra Maestra with two other combatants, only one of which was armed. It was Guillermo Garc\u00eda that got them around the blockade on the old road from the Pil\u00f3n sugar mill to the municipal capital of Niquero; it was he who \u2013 fulfilling other urgent missions given him by the Comandante en Jefe, from Purial de Vicana, or Cinco Palmas de Vicana, where they first set up camp \u2013 gathered together almost all of us who originally joined up, including Ramiro himself, Almeida, Che, Camilo; and thus the initial group of three, then five more, then eight, gradually reuniting this important group of compa\u00f1eros.\n\nOne of the first actions he took in support of the nascent guerilla force, was the number of rifles he collected in the days following these events of which I am speaking, from the 15th to the 18th, which together with the few we already had weren\u2019t event sufficient to form a platoon, but were enough to launch the first attack; and although it might not have been the best moment to do so, with hundreds of soldiers hot on our heels, Fidel said that, with this first battle, we had to show the people that the guerillas were still here and would continue the war. This was the reason behind the battle of La Plata, barely a few weeks after this initial group, with the help of Guillermo Garc\u00eda, were reunited. Other tasks would follow later.\n\nAs the first campesino to join the Rebel Army, he was also the first to be promoted. He had an outstanding track record, first as a combatant and then as second commander of the Third Front, under the command of Almeida.\n\nAfter the triumph of the Revolution, he occupied various positions in the Revolutionary Armed Forces. Later he also served, among other roles, as a Political Bureau delegate in the former province of Oriente; a vice president of the Councils of State and Ministers, Minister of Transport, and President of the Flora and Fauna Enterprise Group, where he has done an outstanding job.\n\nHe was a member of the Party Political Bureau from 1965 through 1986, and is currently a member of the Central Committee and Council of State.\n\nRegarding characteristics shared by these three Mambises of our times I can cite their loyalty to the Revolution and to Fidel, their commitment to work, modesty and humility, which have made them worthy of the recognition and respect of the Cuban people.\n\nIt is not by chance that we are commemorating this date in the Capitolio building, whose tenacious restoration, has enabled the attributes of one of the most important buildings in the country to be highlighted, and in whose crypt rest the ashes of the Unknown Mamb\u00ed, before which an eternal flame burns as a tribute of the people to their founding fathers and the glorious Liberation Army, and is surrounded by the flags of nations of the continent.\n","created_utc":1519784178,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"intlnews","body":" A great article, thanks for posting. Since I wrote it, I will do the honors to reprint it below:\n\nThe bourgeois media in the U$, \u201ca garrison of armed citizens,\u201d has been talking incessantly about the Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre by Nikolas Cruz in Florida which some have called \u201cstate-sponsored domestic terrorism\u201d or a \u201cmajor abuse of human rights.\u201d There have been articles sent off every day on this subject, so many that I can\u2019t even summarize them all in this article. Conservative media have directly attacked the armed deputy who was \u201cassigned to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School,\u201d Scot Peterson, as a \u201ccoward\u201d for not entering the building to stop the shooting (which he reportedly thought was outside) while possibly four other deputies also did nothing to stop the violence. [1] Peterson has resigned since then, with others declaring saying that the sheriff of Broward County, Scott Israel, is \u201ca hack politician whose primary concern is protecting his own political reputation and little fief\u201d and saying this why \u201cwe don\u2019t trust our public institutions.\u201d This criticism also focused on the fact that Broward County received many calls \u201cconcerning Cruz\u201d while the FBI failed to act on a tips it \u201creceived about shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz.\u201d As such, 73 Republicans in Florida called for Sheriff Steve Israel to be suspended (which was happily reprinted by the progressive media outlet, Mother Jones with little comment) by the state\u2019s governor, Rick Scott, who has already launched an official investigation of the response of law enforcement to the shooting itself. This echoes the calls from conservation publications like the National Review and some survivors of the shooting calling for Israel\u2019s resignation. These views are understandable considering that sheriff\u2019s deputies \u201cresponded to at least 45 calls about the shooter before the shooting\u201d but still took no action.\n\n**Responses to the Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre and analysis**\n\nWith this, there have been two responses. For one, conservatives, U$ House Republican leaders, the NRA (with a \u201clarge, ideologically committed membership\u201d as one conservative publication put it) and their lackeys, like the orange menace (Trump) who is exploiting the tragedy for his own gain, have called for more guns in schools, specifically that teachers be armed, which has been widely panned by progressives, and the general population, for good reason. [2] They also rail against gun-free zones in schools and inherently support further militarization of schools, declaring the liberals are \u201cgun grabbers, saying the media has a \u201cliberal bias\u201d and \u201cloves\u201d mass shootings, and declaring they have the \u201cfacts\u201d about gun use, even citing Bob Dylan to support their distorted arguments while laughing at liberals. The reality is that the bourgeois media will profit regardless in such a capitalist society and don\u2019t \u201clove\u201d the shootings as not even bourgeois journalists are subhuman enough to have such beliefs. Still, it is worth pointing out that CNN held a town hall about gun violence, which at minimum raised their stature while the surviving family who was part of it sent doctored emails about the CNN town hall to varied outlets. The liberal response, trumpeted by progressive media, is not much better. They, apart from criticizing hypocritical conservatives, like one that reportedly owned a rifle factory but blamed video games on the shooting, have pushed for further gun control. Over 150 Democrats in the House of Representatives have co-sponsored a bill which would ban on semi-automatic \u201cassault weapons,\u201d with some conservatives call it a \u201cnon-ban\u201d because \u201cassault weapons\u201d is a broadly defined term, which comprises \u201c205 specific firearms that are prohibited, including the AK-47 and AR-15,\u201d leading to further pressure on Congress. At the same time, many firms are dropping their endorsement of the NRA as liberals cheer at their \u201cvictory\u201d which will be further enhanced with the upcoming march on March 24th in Washington, D.C., called \u201cMarch for Our Lives,\u201d organized by a student-led organization named Never Again MSD, while it is co-sponsored by the gun control organization, Everytown for Gun Safety (formerly Mayors Against Illegal Guns), led by former cop-defending NYC mayor, Michael Bloomberg. The march, according to their website, has a mission statement arguing for school safety and reducing gun violence, is followed by other actions across the country. This new push is mainly led by young people, even though they are not more \u201cliberal\u201d on gun control than those of other ages, especially those who are students, some of whom were survivors of the shooting. Of course, these individuals seem to not grasp, by pushing for gun control, that there is seldom \u201cever any one single cause for such an outrageous act of violence as a mass murder, especially when aimed at school children\u201d with environmental and emotional causes.\n\nThis shooting should be no surprise: violence is inherent to the society of the murderous empire, just as it is to capitalist society in general. For the murderous empire, it is expressed through the white supremacist who is running for the U$ Senate in Washington State, the orange menace declaring that he wants to execute drug dealers just like fascist (and anti-communist) Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte or domestic violence in homes across the country, among many other forms of violence. [3] As one writer, Jay Janson, put it, \u201cviolence and heroic gun play is in the air children breath in the USA\u201d since members of the military are \u201chailed in US media as heroic for \u2018serving their country\u2019 in other peoples countries\u201d with the NRA having \u201ca financial interest in the sale and proliferation of guns,\u201d adding that \u201cmost Americans, or at least those addicted to their TV screens, might not see what the Third World and even America\u2019s European allied peoples see clearly\u2026 the Third and Second World see that the seventeen mercilessly slain in Florida last week were the result of American fire power backfiring on its own kids and teachers.\u201d He ended by saying that everyone \u201cshould try to end the era of colonial genocide earlier than it will end in any case,\u201d closing by saying that \u201cthe human species\u2026will soon end this period of profitable genocide for a relatively small group of insane speculative investment bankers of Western de-civilization.\u201d It is my hope that happens, although I\u2019m not always as optimistic or share his view of China leading the world out of an era of Western \u201ccolonial imperialism,\u201d as he calls it, for one, and secondly feel that his analysis is not completely in keeping with radical principles.\n\nAs it always happens in the discourse about guns, it goes back to the Second Amendment of the U$ Constitution: \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d Some have declared that this amendment has \u201cno practical value in thinking about gun control,\u201d saying that the debate over firearms is not between those in favor of gun rights or gun control, but about \u201cwhat kind of controls and restrictions of firearms are right and proper\u201d with the U$ government having the \u201cright\u201d to hold certain arms for military use since the Western Pennsylvania rebellion of 1794, falsely called the \u201cWhiskey Rebellion\u201d after the moniker adopted by aristocrat Alexander Hamilton, with self-proclaimed militias having, in his view, no \u201cbasis in the Constitution.\u201d This same author bloviated that \u201chiding behind the Second Amendment to advocate few or no restrictions on firearms is a nasty scam and misunderstanding of American history. Others said that the magical, mystical \u201cfounding fathers\u201d (a conception which is racist and patronizing) didn\u2019t give people the \u201cright\u201d to bear arms. Such views, as one would expect, do not take in the full picture, the reality of the situation.\n\nRecently, Wayne LaPierre of the NRA spoke to CPAC, where he complained about Karl Marx taught on college campuses and declared that \u201cstudents are even earning academic credit for promoting socialist causes\u201d (which I doubt), while implying that such students favor gun confiscation, while ignoring the U$ Constitution and U$ history, in his distorted view. The reality is very different. Despite what LaPierre said, the reality is that communists are not, by in large, supporters of gun control. Just take a post on a Marxist-Leninist tumblr, as an example. This individual, Steff Yorek, opposed the NRA as a \u201cvile, racist, reactionary organization,\u201d was proud of students taking \u201creins of leadership,\u201d opposing arming of teachers, turning schools into \u201cprisons or military installations,\u201d and putting more school resource officers in schools because it will disproportionately effect Black, indigenous, and Chican@ kids. At the same time, he wrote that he believed in the \u201cright to bear arms and the right to community self-defense are democratic rights and I want to expand democratic rights not shrink them,\u201d adding that the growing anti-fascist, anti-capitalist, and anti-racist group (founded in June 2016 as a \u201ccommunity defense formation\u201d and working to reclaim the word \u201credneck\u201d), Redneck Revolt assisted in evacuating a church in Charlottesville during White supremacist violence. This is forgotten by those who say that the U$ should follow the path of the Chinese and institute gun control.","created_utc":1519825978,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"intlnews","body":"Continued\n\n**A short history of armed resistance in the U$ and analysis of the current \u201cgun culture\u201d**\n\nEchoing this, I return to my articles on gun control and armed resistance, as it worth summarizing the history I put forward there. In the first article, I wrote that gun laws have been \u201cinterlinked with racism and racial politics,\u201d noting that the first targets were enslaved Blacks but also included \u201cfarmers and dispossessed revolutionary war veterans\u201d to prevent them from revolting, in the 1790s and 1820s, with such laws as a form of social control. I also noted that for Blacks who were enslaved, guns were \u201can important and vital tool (one of many tools) of resistance against their chains of human bondage,\u201d adding that they were used to \u201cprotect against violent White supremacists, police, and terrorist vigilantes\u201d with these use of guns feared by brutal slaveowner Thomas Jefferson, among others, while armed White men in slave patrols went around to maintain order and keep enslaved Blacks in their \u201cplace,\u201d with their prohibition ruled as still legal in the South, and cited in the Dred Scott v. Sandford(1857) case as a reason to not give Blacks their full rights. I further added that many of those pushing for abolitionism said that guns were necessary to help Blacks become free, with Harriet Tubman carrying a firearm, while southern Blacks used weapons to defend themselves against racist Whites and White terrorist groups during the Reconstruction. The Supreme Court during the Reconstruction effectively dismantled the 14th Amendment (it was only restored in the 1960s), allowing the \u201cforcible disarmament of free Blacks\u201d and basically \u201cimposing White supremacy\u2026throughout the American South\u201d which did not occur without resistance. In the years to follow, W.E.B. Du Bois of the NAACP defended himself with a gun and championed armed self-defense as a duty of individuals, a position held by other NAACP members and declared often in the organization\u2019s publication, The Crisis. This right to self-defense was later manifested by a Black sharecropper, Pink Franklin, in 1910, Sgt. Edgar Caldwell in 1918 Ossian Sweet in 1925, all of whom were supported by the NAACP, with Black capitalist and Black nationalist Marcus Garvey, despite his faults (like his claim that communism would only benefit White people, calling it a \u201cdangerous theory of economic and political reformation\u201d which puts power in the hands of ignorant White masses), strongly believing in armed self-defense of Blacks. Jumping forward many years, after the Plessy v. Ferguson decision in 1896 which legalized racial segregation in the U$ South, handgun permit and gun registration laws were enacted by varied Southern states, with gun control laws expanding to encompass social control of Whites, Blacks, and other marginalized groups, such as Mexican and Chinese immigrants. The latter was manifested by the Sullivan Act which passed in New York State in 1911. As for the NRA, it promoted gun laws, \u201cembedded with racism,\u201d in the Northern U$, passed in response to \u201curban gun violence and crime often pegged on immigrants, especially those from Italy and Eastern Europe.\u201d The Harvard-educated lawyer heading the NRA, Karl Frederick, drafted model legislation to \u201crestrict concealed carry of firearms in public\u201d which later led to the 1934 National Firearms Act. Adding further to the history, the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), before it was corrupted by revisionists, mobilized mass support for the Scottsboro Boys and other dispossessed individuals, having an organization of armed self-defense as they prepared workers for battles in the 1930s, with sharecroppers in the South engaging in pitched armed battles across Alabama in 1931, 1932, and 1935.\n\nFast forward to the 1950s. By this time, no new gun control legislation had been passed, dedicated Black comrade, Paul L. Robeson, threatened that Blacks would \u201cexercise their right of armed self-defense\u201d if Truman didn\u2019t sign anti-lynching legislation, a threat not based in thin air, with Robeson hounded by the FBI for his strong communist and Marxist views for years, with the Civil Rights Congress, which he was involved with, charging the U$ with genocide in 1951. Robeson traveled abroad after 1958 (when his passport was renewed) and didn\u2019t return to the U$ until 1963, dying 13 years later in 1976. Apart from Robeson, Martin Luther King, Jr., \u201ctook measures to protect himself,\u201d with his home as an arsenal of guns and protected by armed guards, as he even applied for a \u201cconcealed carry permit, under a law that the NRA had promoted thirty years earlier\u201d in 1956 but his \u201capplication was rejected.\u201d Around the same time, Robert F. Williams was beginning his activism for Black freedom. After many years of activism, heading a NAACP branch in Monroe, North Carolina, in May 1959, after a Monroe court acquitted a \u201cwhite man for the attempted rape of a black woman,\u201d he declared that justice in the courts cannot be expected from Blacks, saying that they must \u201cconvict his attackers on the spot. He must meet violence with violence, lynching with lynching.\u201d Of course, this caused a lot of controversy, but he clarified it by saying that if the U$ Constitution could not be enforced, Blacks need to \u201cdefend themselves even if it is necessary to resort to violence,\u201d adding that there is no law in the South, and no need to \u201ctake the white attackers to the courts because they will go free\u201d while the federal government is \u201cnot coming to the aid of people who are oppressed,\u201d adding that Black men should \u201cstand up and be men and if it is necessary for us to die we must be willing to die. If it is necessary for us to kill we must be willing to kill.\u201d That was a strong statement then, and would be a strong statement now. Apart from heading the NAACP branch, he organized, with his wife Mable, and other community members, a rifle club, called the Black Armed Guard, to defend the community from \u201cattacks by the KKK, with the base of the club coming from the NAACP branch that Robert led\u201d and while Black men \u201cdominated the new club, some Black women were members, and the club\u2019s actions were broadly a success\u201d and even using guns to defend Freedom Riders. Robert would later, with his family, live in Cuba to escape a \u201ckidnapping\u201d charge imposed on him by the FBI, later arguing for racial internationalism even as he shied away from Marxism and the then-revisionist CPUSA disliked him, drawing Robert closer to the Trotskyists. Later, he moved with his family to the People\u2019s Republic of China in 1965, where he stayed in exile until 1969 and was pardoned of his \u201ccrimes\u201d in 1975.","created_utc":1519826207,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"intlnews","body":"Continued\n\nAs the years passed, armed self-defense was advocated by even more people in the Black community, with field organizers in the South standing against racial segregation were often protected by armed farmers and workers, with Robert Moses in SNCC saying in 1964 that \u201cit\u2019s not contradictory for a farmer to say he\u2019s nonviolent and also pledge to shoot a marauder\u2019s head off, \u201cwith James Foreman admitting the same year that \u201cI dare say that 85 per cent of all Negroes do not adhere to non-violence. They are allowing the non-violent movement to go ahead because it is working.\u201d Other groups saw such protection as necessary as they refused to \u201cpublicly criticize the use of armed self-defense,\u201d even including Martin Luther King. Others noted that gunfire and the threat of gunfighter helped nonviolence, with the latter not a \u201cway of life for many in the southern Black community\u201d as many households had guns, with \u201carmed supporters protecting field organizers.\u201d By this time, radical Black activists who believed in varied \u201cforms of Black liberation and Black nationalism,\u201d splitting from the bourgeois civil rights movement, including those such as Malcolm X, among others. This was expressed even by the pro-China Progressive Labor Movement, saying that \u201cBlack people\u2026must develop political power outside of the present power apparatus through armed self-defense, political councils, the creation of an economic base, seizing land and factories and\u2026uniting with all workers struggling for revolution\u201d and Malcolm X calling for Black rifle clubs while he threatened Lew Rockwell with \u201cmaximum physical retaliation\u201d if MLK and his fellow demonstrators were harmed. Sadly, on February 21, 1965, the Nation of Islam, likely with the \u201chelp of the NYPD, CIA, and FBI,\u201d gunned down Malcolm X.\n\nOther than Malcolm X, there was a group called the Deacons for Defense and Justice. This group \u201cdefended civil rights workers against attacks from the KKK and other White supremacists,\u201d using masculinist appeals, expanding across the Deep South, with Black women participating informally and individually, defending their homes with armed force, but not directly in the group itself. This group, \u201croughly active from 1964 to 1968\u201d helped the civil rights movement move forward, by allowing this movement \u201cto have victories in the Deep South,\u201d and without the Deacons protecting civil rights workers, \u201cit would have been harder to push for such laws,\u201d like the Civil Rights Act and Voting Rights Act, \u201cregardless of how much they accomplished in retrospect.\u201d While the Progressive Labor Party (PLP), earlier called the Progressive Labor Movement, saw the Watts rebellion (in 1966) as unorganized and facing tremendous odds, saying that people \u201cliberated their own community and kept out the police,\u201d while advocating for \u201cself-defense organizations to help them organize to defend themselves,\u201dMartin Luther King did not agree, even as he saw \u201criots\u201d as the \u201clanguage of the unheard.\u201d The same year, in October, a group founded by Bobby Seale and Huey Newton, the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense (BPP), came onto the scene in Oakland. It centered around the idea of armed self-defense and a whole program of self-defense with demands for basic needs and a program to unfold into socialist revolution, inspired by the efforts of Robert and Malcolm X, using guns as self-protection, carrying them \u201cin public and displaying them for everyone, especially for the local police to see.\u201d At the same time, they pushed the belief that \u201cthe gun would be a way to gain liberation,\u201d with recruits \u201ctaught about socialism and Black nationalism,\u201d as they famously \u201celectrified the nation and brought gun control back into the picture\u201d in 1967 with a \u201cnumber of Panthers, with loaded weapons, went to the state legislature in Sacramento\u201d to oppose a gun control law, the Mulford Act, which was supported by the NRA! Bobby Seale read a statement by Huey Newton saying that the Black Panthers opposed such legislation \u201caimed at keeping the Black people disarmed and powerless at the very same time that racist police agencies throughout the country are intensifying the terror, brutality, murder and repression of Black people,\u201d adding that \u201crepression, genocide, terror and the big stick\u201d is the policy of the empire, arguing that \u201cthe time has come for Black people to arm themselves against this terror before it is too late.\u201d The following year, in 1968, the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act and the Gun Control Act were passed, laying the foundation for \u201cexisting carceral state\u201d with the latter law clearly about controlling Blacks, and was again supported by the NRA!\n\nIn the years to follow, armed self-defense continued to be important for marginalized groups. The Republic of New Afrika (RNA) formed in 1968, and lasting until 1971, aimed to create a Black nation in the South, along the \u201cBlack Belt\u201d of the country, having a group of young Black men with rifles for self-defense and had \u201carmed women serving as security for the RNA\u2019s Land Celebration Day in 1971.\u201d In the Black Panther newspaper, the publication of the Black Panther Party, Emory Douglas drew varied illustrations showing \u201cpoor black women resisting authority in everyday life\u201d especially women with guns and being \u201cequals with men,\u201d with such ideas later leading to a split in the Party, with the creation of the Black Liberation Army (BLA). As for the White establishment, Bobby Kennedy, George McGovern, Ramsey Clark, and the National Violence Commission all supported gun control, while hardliners led by Harlon Carer took control of the NRA in May 1977 in a coup ousting Maxwell Rich. The latter action changed the NRA into a \u201cpro-gun powerhouse and juggernaut where mistrust of law enforcement was one of the main beliefs\u201d which was echoed by Republicans while Blacks embraced gun control due to increased violence in urban areas. Still, there were some groups which continued to support armed self-defense, and armed resistance such as a \u201cRevolutionary Union\u201d group in Detroit, the Brown Berets, a Chican@ nationalist organization, advocating for armed self-defense and armed struggle, as part of their anti-capitalist viewpoint, as necessary tools for liberation,\u201d other Black radicals, and those fighting against White supremacist violence with strength. Specifically, in the later 1970s, the phrase \u201cDeath to the Klan\u201d was spread across the U$, with some left-wing groups supporting \u201cmilitant, anti-racist opposition to the Klan\u201d by organizing within unions and against racism in varied communities. The result was the Greensboro Massacre in 1979 where Nazis, as the police and federal authorities looked the other way, opened fire on these left-wing activists, resulting in many deaths. Other groups supporting such methods included the United League in North Mississippi which \u201corganized the masses, engaging in armed self-defense\u201d and took \u201cprecautions against Klan threats,\u201d with other groups coming out of the efforts by left-wing groups to oppose the Klan, especially among the Puerto Rican and Black communities. Since the 1980s, there has not been any organized efforts of armed self-defense until very recently, as I noted in my next article.\n\nIn the next part of the series, I specifically focused on gun control in the murderous empire. I wrote that indigenous peoples heroically resisted White European settlers but they were suppressed due to a superiority of weapons among the former, adding that armed resistance \u201chas been an effective form of self-defense,\u201d especially since the \u201clong history of racial domination\u201d in the Americas for Black people (1510-2018), beginning on January 22, 1510, noting the ahistorical arguments by gun rights supporters and by those for gun control, with the latter disregarding \u201cthe fact that enslaved Blacks gained guns during the Civil War and due to evasion of gun control laws, allowing them to engage in armed resistance.\u201d I also pointed out that apart from the Deacons, Black Panthers, and Brown Berets (a new version formed in 1993), there are other groups, historically such as the Young Lords among the Puerto Rican Community, the Young Patriots, and the American Indian Movement (still existing). At the present, I pointed out that the Nation of Islam has armed wings for men and women, while also highlighting the Red Guards in Texas, Brothas Against Racist Cops, Redneck Revolt (including the John Brown Gun Club), the Huey P. Newton Gun Club, with other groups I listed not seeming to be that active. [4] After talking about recent developments on gun rights, such as the District of Columbia v. Heller, and McDonald v. Chicago cases, I noted that Antonin Scalia in the majority decision in the latter decision arguing that \u201cthe Fourteenth Amendment contemplated guns rights because it was based on the Civil Rights Act of 1866.\u201d This is interestingly enough, correct, as a Black Code enacted by Mississippi in November 1865 worked to restrict gun and weapon use, while the Second Freedman\u2019s Bill passed the same year said that states should honor the \u201cconstitutional right of bearing arms\u201d saying that it cannot be \u201crefused or denied to negroes, mulattoes, freedmen, refugees, or any other persons, on account of race, [or] color\u201d and likely influencing the 1868 Mississippi Constitution which declared that \u201call persons shall have a right to keep and bear arms for their defense.\u201d","created_utc":1519826336,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"intlnews","body":"Continued.\n\n\n\nAfter highlighting gun clubs and debate over guns, I noted that some asked if it as \u201ctime to start resisting police with violence.\u201d With this, I highlighted that \u201cfirearms are used far more often to intimidate than in self-defense\u201d and said that \u201cguns can frighten and intimidate\u201d which is part of self-defense, even quoting a liberal who argued against gun laws saying that they contribute, like other criminal laws, to Black incarceration. As such, I focused on a group for Black gun owners called the National African American Gun Association, protests with guns by the problematic \u201cNew Black Panther Party\u201d (which do not legitimately hold claim to the name), a group called the Liberal Gun Club, comprises of \u201cgun-owning liberals and moderates,\u201d and still-existing group called the Pink Pistols, which argues against gun control, argues that there is a connection between \u201cgay rights and gun rights.\u201d The latter group is a self-defense group for non-binary folks (often called LGBTQ+) which was founded in 2000 with the idea that \u201carmed queers don\u2019t get bashed,\u201dfiling court cases on their behalf. Additionally I noted that some had floated the idea of Communist Gun Clubs and argued that \u201cwe should not reject those in the heartland of the United States who may oppose fracking but also strongly believe in their right to have firearms\u201d as an example. I also added that gun laws, as they stand now, \u201ccontribute to the white supremacist order\u201d with such laws connected a \u201ccorrectional control\u201d in the country as a whole, saying that as a practical measure, funding for mental health programs should be increased, while adding that gun laws don\u2019t \u201chelp protect marginalized communities, arguably disarming them at most, or weakening their protection at minimum.\u201d I also quoted a person on the \u201cLeft\u201d as saying that the right of \u201cnecessary self-defense against oppressive force\u201d should be recognized with a gun culture on the Left, arguing that \u201cguns are a small business in the US at large,\u201d and saying that \u201cgun control won\u2019t bring us to a humane society.\u201d This same writers noted that Eugene Debs called for guns after the Ludlow Massacre to \u201cprotect from Rockefeller\u2019s assassins,\u201d the story of armed miners \u201cin Harlan Country in the 1930s,\u201d and urban labor unions providing \u201carmed protection,\u201d even as he rejected the \u201cright-wing\u2019s fetishization of brute force\u201d without a doubt.\n\nFrom there, I noted that due to the fact that society of the empire is \u201cracist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, and otherwise bigoted,\u201d it would be \u201ccriminal and irresponsible to fight for gun control\u201d because anyone considered \u201ca \u201cminority\u201d in current society, should have the right to defend themselves with arms as necessary\u201d since this is claimed by White, straight men, so it is only logical that others in society should have this right, in order to \u201cfight off bigots.\u201d I further added that a revolution cannot be fought with \u201cflowers and sayings, but political power\u201d and said that \u201cgun control, if decided as necessary, should happen after a socialist revolution, not before it.\u201d Adding to this, I said that armed self-defense \u201ccannot occur as effectively with gun control measures in place,\u201d adding that \u201cthe focus on gun control should be removed from the equation, with other approaches instead, which are more effective.\u201d After that, I cited the writings of Karl Marx, who argued in 1850 for organizing and arming the proletariat \u201cwith rifles, guns, and ammunition\u201d with the proletariat under no pretext giving \u201cup their arms and equipment\u201d with any \u201cattempt at disarmament must be forcibly resisted,\u201d and those of Vladimir Lenin who argued for \u201cspecial bodies of armed men,\u201d even saying at one point that \u201conly an armed people can be a real stronghold of national freedom\u2026the sooner the proletariat succeeds in arming itself, and the longer it maintain its position of striker and revolutionary, the sooner the soldiers will at last begun to understand what they are doing, they will go over to the side of the people.\u201d With this I concluded that guns can be a tool to \u201callow socialist revolution to succeed,\u201d noting that guns can \u201cbe used for malevolent ends\u201d but can also \u201cbe used to allow socialist revolution to succeed.\u201d From there, I analyzed the Second Amendment, arguing that the amendment says that \u201cmilitia units in states should be well-regulated for the purposes of securing the State\u2026but also declares that \u201cthe people\u201d which means the whole population of the US\u2026have the right to \u201ckeep and bear Arms\u201d interpreting the word \u201carm\u201d to apply to \u201cALL weapons, not just guns\u201d meaning that people have the \u201cright to defend themselves with \u201cfists, feet, stones, bricks, blades, and gasoline firebombs\u201d\u201d apart from just guns. I ended the article by saying that rather than \u201cwaiting\u201d for revolution there must be action at the present \u201cagainst the threats that face this planet and its people, even when one should do so without illusion, whatever form that takes offline or online.\u201d","created_utc":1519826385,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"intlnews","body":"Continued. \n\n**A radical way forward**\n\nThere is no doubt, as Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz argues, the murderous empire has a gun culture because of the tradition of \u201ckilling, looting, burning, raping, and terrorizing Indians\u201d as inherent to the murderous empire itself, even before the Constitutional Convention. Dunbar-Ortiz, who notes that Richard Hofstadter coined the term \u201cgun culture,\u201d adds that the Second Amen dent specifically gave \u201cindividuals and families the right to form volunteer militias to attack Indians and take their land\u201d with later, slave patrols drawn from these very militias! She added that the main problem with the current gun debate is that neither side, those for gun control or those for gun rights, don\u2019t wish to admit what the \u201cSecond Amendment was originally about and why its sanctity has persisted\u201d as she argues, in a new book (Loaded: A Disarming History of the Second Amendment) that the Second Amendment is \u201ckey to understanding the gun culture of the United States,\u201d and key to a new consciousness about the \u201clinger effects of settler-colonialism and white nationalism,\u201d with a necessary reflection needed on \u201chow the violence it [the Amendment] has spawned has deeply influenced the character of the United States.\u201d There is no doubt she is right. There\u2019s more to what\u2019s happening now than what is declared in think pieces by liberals or conservatives. While is is valid that the Second Amendment was part of an effort by the South \u201cdetermined to ensure that slave owners could pursue runaways.\n\nThere is more as is states the column by self-declared socialist, but really liberal-at-heart, Chris Hedges. In his piece, he says that proliferation of guns in the murderous empire benefits gun manufacturers but  \u201cfools the disempowered into fetishizing weapons as a guarantor of political agency,\u201d saying that gun ownership is \u201clargely criminalized for poor people of color, is a potent tool of oppression,\u201d saying it is \u201can instrument of tyranny,\u201d saying that \u201cmass culture and most historians do not acknowledge the patterns of violence that have played out over and over since the founding of the nation.\u201d He adds that a gun, as it stands in the U$, \u201creminds Americans that they are divine agents of purification, anointed by God and Western civilization to remake the world in their own image\u201d with American \u201cvigilantes are the shock troops of capitalism\u201d and gun ownership being the \u201cfear by white people of the black and brown underclass, an underclass many whites are convinced will threaten them as society breaks down\u201d with guns rarely deployed against the state, as the gun, in his summary, \u201cseems to be the last tangible relic of a free and mythic America.\u201d He ends by saying that attacks on gun violence and gun culture is seen \u201cby many gun owners as an attack on their national identity\u201d with the almost always White Male lone killer \u201ccelebrated by Hollywood and in our national myth.\u201d \n\nHedges makes a good point, as does Dunbar-Ortiz. However, Hedges seems to whitewash any history of armed resistance by the oppressed over U$ history, likely because of his beliefs in \u201cpeaceful\u201d revolution, a laughable concept if I ever heard one. In terms of gun violence, there is a better way forward, which is not posed by Hedges. One can, as a start, push for the banning of \u201cROTC from public schools,\u201d against expanded military recruitment, and further militarization. This obviously will not address gun violence at its root. That would require, all armaments should be taken away from the capitalist state and its armed forces. This includes the military, police forces, and any other forces of terror in society as a whole. Some may say this is impossible in a capitalist society as the bourgeoisie would never allow this, which is the reality. As such, there would need to be a revolution in the empire, as it splinters and explodes into different pieces, benefiting the world as a whole, giving an opportunity for the proletariat, allowing these weapons to be taken away. Of course, this cannot be imposed from above, and has to be a process of working with the proletariat itself, as anything but this approach would be fundamentally elitist and betray efforts to build a revolution. Taking this into account, calls for taking or limiting guns used by the populace, the latter favored more by liberals than seizure of guns, which is an inherent aspect of gun control, is a death nail to revolution and brings with it more social control without question, increasing the already strong system of mass incarceration in the U$ which liberals only flit about with \u201creforms\u201d of prisons, rather than favoring efforts at abolition. It is only after a socialist revolution was completed that gun control could be implemented, as it was in Cuba or in Juche Korea, to give two examples of countries under imperialist attack.\n\nThis may seem all too fantastical for some, however those people don\u2019t see the full picture. There is no doubt that many gun owners are well-off White Males who live in rural areas (and smaller urban areas), with 3% of the population owning nearly half of the country\u2019s guns, having them mainly for \u201cprotection,\u201d and do not have any revolutionary feelings or much developed class consciousness. These are the same people who broadly favorrepressive agencies such as the FBI, and CIA, among varied other government agencies, even as they feel the government helps the wealthy more than any other group in society. With that, there is slight dissatisfaction with current gun laws. As such, in the current situation of the empire, those with guns will not magically join up a revolution against capitalism and wave a red flag like Charlie Chaplin in Modern Times, before he was beat up by the police. Instead, the development of a revolution in the murderous empire would take time and organization, perhaps with soviets like the one put together by the Party of Socialism and Liberation last year, or those endorsed by the Venezuelan Communist Party, as I read recently in their publication, Popular Tribune.\n\nWhile my opinions are still developing as I learn more about varied topics, writing about issues relating directly to the murderous empire and efforts at resisting imperialism in other corners of the world whether it be Palestine or Juche Korea, I continue to stand strongly against capitalism in all its forms and in solidarity with all those resisting it, not any flunkeys like the so-called \u201crevolutionary\u201d Kurds of Rojava who are utter posers. Violence is inherent to the murderous empire and it has been that way since its legal creation in 1783 with the Treaty of Paris, and from 1607 until that point, as the White English settled their part of the North American continent, creating another colony of the British empire, while the Spanish, French, and Dutch also staked out their claims, expanding their imperialist systems. While a revolution to bring down the murderous empire is developed, all efforts of armed resistance should be supported while typical \u201cnonviolent methods\u201d still has some value in social movements, but not as much as it used to have. After all, there should be a diversity of tactics that are used. The same goes for supporting all those being oppressed by the capitalist poles of power in the world and all of those who appease these poles of power.","created_utc":1519826424,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

I\u2019m well aware of it\u2019s emergence through the ashes of Germany\u2019s collective humiliation after WW1 by the hands of France, mainly when they invaded and held territory. In addition, there were already leagues of anti-Semitic and anti-communist groups operating in German metropolitan areas long before the Nazi Upheaval. \n\nAnd yeah, America is fascist. We still have racial and gender inequality as a *bipartisan* issue (I hate that word so fucking much). To me, that alone is reminiscent of the racial rhetoric that pervaded the Nazi party.

The proletarian approach to politics analyzes material reality through collective discussion and, in doing so, provides the basis for the people to methodically advance the struggle to overcome all oppression and exploitation. In contrast, lackeyism encourages a mentality of avoiding, obscuring, and mystifying the key political questions of our moment in favor of currying favor with power and thereby builds unprincipled political unities based on opportunism, convenience, and slavish deference to authority.\n\nThis lackeyism is evident in RGA\u2019s approach to both questions of local political work and in their analysis of the international situation\u2014in particular in their assessment of the political character of groups like the Syrian People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG). RGA\u2019s reductionist analysis and lackeyist approach to politics encourages people not to examine questions concretely, but instead to follow the line that their \u201cleadership\u201d has developed based on reductionist and metaphysical dualisms such as \u201cus versus them\u201d and \u201crevolutionary versus fascism.\u201d RGA has innovated new ways of reducing revolutionary principles to counterrevolutionary soundbites, a process endemic to the bourgeois world order and constantly refined by various pro-state interests in the U.S. including its vast NGO apparatus. RGA\u2019s blatant distortions of Maoism, and their rabid support for the lackeys of U.S. imperialism in Syria, should sound loud alarm bells to revolutionaries in the U.S. that RGA is not to be trusted, and indicate that they see fit to mingle with some of the most negative forces of our times.

It's not just \"oh, we'll go back to gold.\"  It's \"gold was a commodity-money, and commodities, if they're to contain value, must also contain socially necessary labor-time.\"  But what the hell does a fiat dollar unit contain, if not backed by something with value?  Two things of value are no longer being exchanged anymore.  But one of those things is still confined to socially necessary labor-time (labor-power) and the other is just paper (the dollar), and can't express socially necessary labor-time, and thus commodity production is no longer regulated by it.  Trump plays no real part in this.  He can make wild promises to ostensibly double the rate of profit (2% to 4% \"growth\") but we ultimately want him to fail in \"creating jobs.\"  Communists, to be frank, do not give a fuck about job creation.
