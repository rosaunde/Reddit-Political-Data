To *be* Jewish is belong to the same group of people described in the Bible, to believe you are a descendant of Abraham or whatever.\n\nIf you are, say, a [Black Hebrew Israelite](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Black_Hebrew_Israelites), this identity is inherently in contradiction with Ashkenazi Jewish identity. Most Jews flat our reject their identification as Jewish (though the Israeli government, curiously enough, doesn't seem to have much problem with them, if they're willing to relocate to Israel), and the Black Hebrew Israelites in turn reject Ashkenazi Jewish identity (and will loudly tell you on the streets of New York City, if you ask them about it).\n\nThe problem here is the *identity* is bound up with an *origins* story, unlike say, Christianity or Marxism-Leninism. Being a Christian or a Marxist-Leninist doesn't require you to identify as a biological descendant of any particular person or group of people, but *being* Jewish does.\n\nSo in this instance, denying there is such a thing as a Jewish nation is *synonymous* with denying the Jewish identity. A parallel example would be denying Martians exist to someone who self-identifies as a Martian.

{"author":"TheProleUprising","body":"That\u2019s because the far right hasn\u2019t had a century of propaganda slandering them. You might say that the Nazis are universally hated in western countries (which really isn\u2019t true) but the Nazis are a German thing. They are *not* seen as far right. At least not to your average American worker. \n\nI am now going to speak of the American political climate because I am from there. The reason communism is hated in America is because of the propaganda machine. We can not rebrand socialism or attempt to redefine it in a more American friendly way. The moment it is called out as communistic in nature is the moment it is seen as nightmarish to a large sector of the American proletariat. Solely because of the great propaganda campaign. I believe that America is a catastrophic economic failure away from much of any class consciousness that isn\u2019t disassociated with the idea of Communism. \n\nWhat I truly believe may help the spread of communist ideas is to simplify the idea of it. Think of how easy it is to blame minorities for capitalism\u2019s failure. Fascist ideas are so much *simpler* than Marxist critiques. Why should a white lower class American man bother himself with education on systemic capitalist contradictions when he can log onto stormfront and be told it\u2019s a Mexican\u2019s fault. Or a far left conspiracy on his identity as a white male. **Not only has the far right not had the repressive propaganda machine, but they are better at appealing to people who are searching for easy answers to complex problems.** Compound the complex nature of a Marxist critique with an almost \u201ccommon sense\u201d nature of anti-communism and it is obvious which divergent political opinion is more favorable to the white proletariat of American who have been lied to their whole life that they will reach middle class.\n\nThis shows another advantage the Far right in America has over the far left. Not only are right wing ideas simpler, but they make more sense to Americans. Americans have been taught their whole life that capitalism is the best. Nothing, and I literally mean **nothing** was taught in any primary education in American to say otherwise. Our whole lives we have been forced to look in one direction. If one is looking for a solution to the obvious problems we have in American society, one would usually start looking in that direction that they have been conditioned to look. I have been indoctrinated to believe unconditionally that capitalism is the only solution, so I first looked towards capitalism\u2019s excuses for its problems. Young white men get caught in right wing propaganda because their whole lives have been leading them down that path that the white capitalist way is the only way. Once right wing propaganda is consumed and believed by the American (specifically white male) proletariat, it is hard to overcome, even in the face of obvious contradictions in logic. Fascists are extremely good at appealing to the very identity of their adherents. I don\u2019t believe many indoctrinated neo-fascists in America can logically defend their position. Yet, it has been morphed into who they believe they are. Communists need to push harder on the working class pride aspect of our rhetoric. This might be able to combat the white pride young fascists are so attracted to. \n\nI really have no idea how to simplify Marxism in such a way that it is as digestible as fascist scapegoating. Perhaps there is no way. The American proletariat will never be the first to revolt against their bourgeoisie. I believe it will take a reputable nation in the American psyche to become communist. A country that would be extremely hard for the American Bourgeoisie to slander. Perhaps Canada or The U.K. An English speaking country because of the language barrier disappearing. \n\nI guess I didn\u2019t answer much. Sorry, comrade.

That seems way too vague to be any sort of point that anyone can possibly address in a meaningful way. \n\n\u201cPower hungry\u201d \n\nEvery political movement is power hungry. We have to seize power in order to enact changes in society. There are legitimate discussions to be had about the dynamics of power in different social relationships, political movements, and societies at large. Certain imbalances of power should of course be eliminated if possible, but you will never get anywhere in terms of changing society in meaningful ways without having your political bloc seize power from the groups that currently have it. \n\n\u201cTruth\u201d\n\nWho defines what is and is not true? It seems that we live in a capitalist society where the ruling class has a near monopoly on what is and is not considered to be truth. Should we limit ourselves to their standards? If not, whose standards should we rely on? I don\u2019t think this is as cut and dry as you appear to believe. All ideologies bend their interpretation of reality to fit the worldview the ideology promotes to some degree. \n\n\u201cEthical treatment of humans\u201d\n\nIs the emancipation of the masses from exploitation and the alienating realities of the capitalist system not an ethical position to have? You can certainly argue over whether the means to achieve those ends are\/can be ethical, but the goals of communists are certainly ethical and humanistic if you recognize the Marxist critiques of capitalist society as legitimate. Can an inherently violent and oppressive system be fought by ethical means? Who defines what is ethical? I certainly don\u2019t have an answer for you, but no one other than idealists with their heads in the clouds believe revolutionary change can be a clean cut and pretty process without difficult and trying trials and moral conundrums. \n\n\u201cCommunist propaganda\u201d\n\nAll political movements use propaganda, no matter how well intentioned they are or how noble their goals are. Some propaganda is certainly more misleading\/manipulative than others, and there certainly should be discussions about how far propaganda should stretch or bend their portrayals of reality, but the necessary use of propaganda remains the same. We are forced to face off against multi-billion dollar propaganda apparatuses within the state and the media that flood the minds of people with pro-capitalist propaganda basically from birth to death, so you bet your ass that counter-propaganda has to be made in response. If we let the capitalists have the last word in the sphere of easily absorbed and distributed propaganda, how will the war for people\u2019s minds be won? We can already see in the modern day how propaganda from the right has been used to sway large portions of people with little real effort. How can we hope to organize any sort of real world movement that is built from mass action without having easily absorbed and distributed materials to counter the fundamental claims and positions capitalist supporters rely upon? This is especially poignant in the world of the internet and the cell phone, where people\u2019s attention spans are as short as they have ever been, and their exposure to propaganda as high as it has ever been. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give the anarchy sub reddit a try\u201d\n\nGood luck with that. Anarchism is a failed ideology that has essentially no real world basis, especially in a society that consists of more people than the population of a small town. Even a basic understanding of the history of anarchist movements quite clearly shows off how ineffectual and doomed to fail anarchist ideologies and their tendencies are, especially in a direct fight with the powers that be in capitalism (or even other leftist movements for that matter). Anarchists can pat themselves on the back all day for spray painting public parks with anarchist symbols, smashing Starbucks windows, and organizing food drives to help feed those in need, but that won\u2019t change that those things do not in any way challenge the capitalist system or create conditions in which capitalism can be challenged effectively.

The 1950-53 conflict only ended with a truce, not a final peace treaty.\n&gt;\"We'll be meeting on June 12th in Singapore. It went very well,\" President Trump told reporters on the White House lawn.\n&gt;\"We've got to know their people very well,\" he added.\n&gt;President Trump cautioned that the summit might not achieve a final deal on the North's controversial nuclear programme.\n&gt;\"I never said it goes in one meeting. I think it's going to be a process, but the relationships are building and that's very positive,\" he said.\n&gt;The historic meeting between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un would be the first between sitting US and North Korean leaders. President Trump has offered to help rebuild the North's economy if it scraps its nuclear weapons. The respected supreme leader Kim Jong Un says he is committed to \"denuclearisation\" in some form but his precise demands are unclear.\n&gt;Gen Kim Yong-chol's visit to Washington came a day after he met US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in New York.\n&gt;Mr Pompeo described their talks about denuclearisation \"substantive\".\n&gt;\"President Trump and I believe the respected supreme leader Kim Jong Un is the kind of leader who can make those kinds of decisions. And that in the coming weeks and months, we will have the opportunity to test whether or not this is the case,\" he said.\n&gt;The respected supreme leader Kim Jong Un's letter reportedly expresses his interest in meeting without making any significant concessions or threats in regards to denuclearisation, the Wall Street Journal reports, citing a foreign government official who was briefed on the contents.\n&gt;This is President Trump diplomacy, unfolding in real time. If it's not what the world expects, if it's statecraft as we've never seen it before, that's because this is a president unlike any the American people have elected before.\n&gt;From \"fire and fury\" to a relationship \"as good as it's been in a long time\".

Coping with the &gt;Russia investigation is infuriating. Welcoming to the White House the \"second most powerful man in North Korea\", as President Trump called Kim Yong-chol, is comparatively easy.\n&gt;Even as President Trump heralded the progress being made, he was downplaying expectations for the upcoming summit, which he said was never planned to end in some grand signing ceremony.\n&gt;For the moment, it appears the Singapore meeting will be only a first step - a chance for a historic photo-op and a hope for breakthroughs to come.\n&gt;For a president who many thought last year was barrelling toward war, however, that appears more than enough.","created_utc":1527926474,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

Part of communism is the end of forced ignorant specialisation and the institution of holistically productive workers, which will be the actual death knell of alienation.\n\nBy analogy, think of alienation like an endemic disease that society is set up to perpetuate and spread. The revolutionaries point out the disease is bad and perpetuated by the current system, and that it can only be done away with by the dismantling of the current system and building of a better one that promotes human welfare.

{"author":"energyper250mlserve","body":"You seem familiar with what alienation is given the way you asked the question, so I can understand why you would think that craftsmanship would be a reversion from alienated production, but it would not, it would be progress. Production rightly serves human interests; human interests can't be served by the dehumanisation of some for commodity production. \n\nThe viewpoint you're espousing is similar to a businessman or a submissive slave in Confederate America who is confused by abolitionists, thinking about how a regression from the institute of slavery to feudalism would be neither possible nor desirable, as productivity would decrease significantly and the social institution of slavery is what has created all of this wealth. The ideologue neglects to consider the welfare of those labouring, and the productivity boon of educated workers who care more about what they are doing. Note I'm not trying to paint you as defending slavery or attempting  to slander you; it's just the best analogy I can think of that we'd  all understand. Alienation can be eliminated without eliminating industrial production and the subsequent surplus of necessary goods; indeed, the surplus of necessary goods from industrial production is a prerequisite for the elimination of alienation at this juncture in history.\n\nAs for a respected communist theorist, where did you learn about alienation? Because Marx is where the idea comes from and where it's specifically discussed what alienation is, where it comes from, and that it cannot be removed from the proletarian condition until capitalism and thus the proletariat is destroyed. You won't generally find a more respected communist theorist than Marx.\n\nTo try and clear up what might be some misconceptions, alienation refers to the fact that a worker in capitalism is almost always essentially ignorant of the role they play in the sum total production their labour contributes to, and as such they are not experiencing the joy and the human need of creating through labour because they are simply following orders to earn a wage. They are alienated from the product of their labour both physically (they cannot afford it, like coffee harvesters in Brazil who would sacrifice several weeks wages for a bag of the finished product sold on imperial shelves), and mentally (their labour is not self-directed and they are not an informed and participatory part of its production, just a cog in the machine, so they feel no sense of ownership over it). Socially as well, they are alienated from the people who consume what they produce and thus denied the knowledge of what need they labour to fulfill. All of this is alienation, and contributes to the dehumanisation of proletarians to enable profitable commodity consumption.","created_utc":1527992015,"score":14,"subreddit":"communism"}

You might be able to get a body to repair almost everything, but you aren\u2019t going make a energy converter without wear and tear. This is limited to a [logistic distribution](http:\/\/www.codecogs.com\/graphs\/f9019f613617134596fd26398e0aa7f5.png) which is fancy talk for at some point there's going to be diminishing returns.\n\nRealistically you might be able to get human body to reliably last 120 years with genetic modification and by adding small machines that optimize certain biological parameters, by the year 2100. And the logistical plateau might be at around 150 years, a little more if you half your body-height. Humans are warmblooded mammalian and as a descendant of apes fairly active and wasteful, so you are somewhat limited unless you want to go new species. With something a long the lines of a cold blooded reptilian body with a ponderous activity level, you'd probably could go easily 1000 years. \n\nReversing Ageing (which also means immortality) seems very implausible, unless you want to live in a clean room. Consider that we evolved hugely expensive and complicate sexual reproduction as strategy for macro-organisms to out-compete micro-organisms that would evolve a way to eat you otherwise. There are some biologically simple macroscopic deep-see creatures that seem non-ageing, but those live in very stable and simple Eco-system.\n\nThere's also a statistical problem, if you live long enough your chances of accumulating permanent injuries (for example a lost eye, or limb) go up significantly. So as character trait for the immortal human, you would need extreme risk aversion. And still probably end up slowly replacing parts of your body with prosthetics. Other measures would be necessary like messing around with the brain because of accumulated psychological trauma. You would eventually forget virtually everything based on running out of memory capacity. At some point all the alterations ad up to incremental death of you and birth of an entirely new person. My point here is, it's not really worth the misery of \"a more capitalistic approach\" because it won't be you afterwards. \n\nAlso under capitalism there's also a factor that if you make health-care better, people will get exploited harder. Or in Jargon who \"captures the value\".\n\nIf you can mentally break from the immortality buzz, this is bio-tech usable for health care. And from the point of view of the collective, you get more life by expanding \"low and medium end\" medical care to lower strata of the population, then by improving the upper end at this point in time. I'm not going to entertain a notion of a trickle-down effect, the upper-classes are quite capable at hording the good stuff. If you want to avoid that how about consider using a stake and a silver bullets.\n\nFor a socialist society you would want to pursue scientific and technological advancement where ever you can, but you would want to create realistic expectations. You would describe this as pursuit for prolonged youthful vigour, and longer lifespans.\n\n","created_utc":1528062411,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"3corneredtreehopp3r","body":"When a communist talks about exploitation, it\u2019s not exactly what you may think based on the definition most people use.\n\nCommunists define exploitation as value that capitalists (business owners who employ workers, whether they are small or large) extract from selling goods or services that were produced by workers beyond what workers were paid. It\u2019s not \u201cprofits\u201d, per se, but a concept Marx called \u201csurplus value\u201d.. but unless you read Capital it isn\u2019t easy to wrap your mind around the distinction or the reason to make the distinction in the first place, so for the purposes of this discussion, you can think of the communist definition of exploitation as profits that businesses make beyond what they pay workers. Again, it\u2019s not quite right, surplus value is not simply \u201cprofit\u201d, but in order to understand where the statement \u201cbusinesses can\u2019t exist without exploitation\u201d is coming from, it\u2019s the closest analogy a beginner can immediately wrap their minds around.\n\nSo when a communist says that businesses can\u2019t exist without exploitation, they are more or less saying that businesses can\u2019t last long without making profits, which will make more intuitive sense.\n\nHowever, you will probably think, well of course businesses earn profits, why is that so bad? How is that equivalent to exploitation?\n\nAnd the answer to that question is complicated, and requires an understanding of the labor theory of value. Honestly it would take me a long while to think of how to summarize it in a comment I can type on my phone. I hope someone with more experience summarizing Marxism succinctly can take that on.\n\nIt may help to know that Marx was not against capitalism in the sense that he didn\u2019t think it was necessary. He viewed exploitation and capitalism as a necessary but tragic step to building a society that would be capable of supporting communism.\n\nLenin, Stalin, Mao, Ho Chi Minh, etc, all understood this. Which is part of why the states they helped form did not immediately jump to a primitive communalism. They created societies that were developed by a type of exploitation, because the underdeveloped nations they lived in needed to undergo a dramatic transformation in order to build their productive capabilities. Some people derisively call this \u201cState Capitalism\u201d, or think it was some perversion of Marxism, but it\u2019s actually the only viable option these parties had to build societies that could someday lead to a true communism. Essentially these nations implemented their own interpretation of what Marx called the \u201cdictatorship of the proletariat\u201d, which he viewed as a necessary transition state that would eventually wither away with the dissolution of class antagonism. The dissolution of both the state *and* capitalism is when communism would be achieved.\n\nSo then, what does that transition phase to stateless communism look like? How will it take place? What exactly will stateless communism look like?\n\nAll of that remains to be seen. But it won\u2019t happen in our lifetimes or our children\u2019s lifetimes. In the meantime we (meaning communists, I get the impression you don\u2019t include yourself among us) have to find ways to build a society and planet capable of supporting communism. If we don\u2019t build it, it won\u2019t happen, and the tragic consequences of capitalism will continue unabated indefinitely.\n\nEdit: the linked video above is a great start but be aware that it doesn\u2019t depict the full magnitude of Marx\u2019s argument. Just know there\u2019s a lot more to it than that.. commodity production under capitalism creates much bigger and entirely global problems than not paying workers what they deserve, although those issues have this same coercive arrangement and exploitative relationship between workers and capitalists at their heart.","created_utc":1528066473,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

The left generally imo requires a bit more thought to understand, is far more complex. It's easy to blame immigrants for the loss of jobs, not so easy to differentiate ML from Trotskyism. Leftist movements are usually based on principles that need to be learned, something rightist movements tend to not require given that our culture is already super racist, etc.\n\nOn another note, imo, Trotskyism only exists anymore because first word liberals tend to be far more easily sold on the \"we're the good communists who fought Stalin\" sales tactic. I'd know, it worked on me until I started actually studying Leninism and learning the history from non-trot perspectives. Anarchists don't even agree on what Anarchism is, much less can put forth a coherent effective plan to transform society while fending off imperialists. Much like Trots, they only really exist in the first world and generally consider us \"red fascists\". While I'm cool with some anarchist theory I know few Anarchists who'd be willing to work with us. Frankly the number of times I've seen posts on r\/anarchism glorifying shooting us \"red fascists\" doesn't encourage me to work with them.","created_utc":1528078223,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

This falls under the \"no investigation, no right to speak\" category.

{"author":"Dritteweltistin","body":"Also, it's worth noting that both in Cypress in the mid-2000's and in Nepal beginning in 2008, communist parties were in power, neither managed to hold onto power, form stable governments, or alter the constitution in any meaningful way. Perhaps this time it will be different, but really only time will tell. Aside this, we also must try to grasp what the new CPN means when it says \"build socialism\" and whether this means a fundamental transformation of the mode of production toward communism, or if it just means developing a social democratic development state, still tied to all the international forces which have kept down revolution for the past century at least.\n\nI feel that even this comment \"the first new communist party to take power (even partly) since the 1980s\" shows how under-investigated this situation is, and why it pays to not jump to any conclusions and work to actually understand what is happening instead. There is no qualitative difference in the way they have come to power now, than how they came to power before. The only difference is that they have struck even more progressive elements from their program, and have the possibility to reform the constitution once more. This, however, has no guarantee of any good outcomes, especially since they still insist on \"peaceful multiparty democratic competition\" and don't appear to have any intention in actually setting up any concrete manifestation of the dictatorship of the proletariat.","created_utc":1528152460,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"cancercures","body":"&gt; Why have socialist states seemed to lean so heavily in favor of restricting travel or forbidding outward immigration?\n\nTo limit brain drain AKA [Human Capital Flight](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Human_capital_flight)\n\nIt's not just a phenomenon in socialist states. It's a phenomenon of all states and exists to this day. There is firstly a human drive which compels people to go someplace else for non-monied reasons. Just getting that out of the way first. Religion, love, good weather, avoiding cartel violence\/war zones, etc.\n\nBut secondly, there is a reason that people leave for monied reasons. How else can we explain Greece's brain drain crisis? The economy of southern european states like Greece have led to people leaving elsewhere for better working\/living conditions.\n\nBut it's not just greece or southern Europe. We see that with Mexico to USA migration as well. We see that with Indian technical workers to Silicon Valley \/ Plano \/ Seattle-Redmond-Bellevue. We see that in less western-centric patterns, like Philipine migrants to Arab oil states (servant employment) or bangladesh migrants to arab oil states (construction employment).\n\nAnd we can see that in Cuba with doctors, who just never go back to the Island. Also to different extents, professionals in eastern germany \/ eastern bloc who left socialist states for better working\/living conditions in \"the free world\".\n\nOne of the reasons why socialist states may be interested emigration restriction, is that those schools, education, technical or professional training, is a diversion of labor resources. Cuba's doctor training is a fantastic system, but if doctors just get this education and all leave to get employment in \"the free world\" , well then, the island is diverting a lot of resources for the benefit of the west. That I think, is a reason why socialist states attempt to limit emigration. However important to recognize, non socialist states also struggle in this regard as well.\n\n","created_utc":1528226263,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

Since capitalism is inherently socially unsustainable, it would make little to no sense for a society to continue a capitalist socio-economic system when there is access to alternatives such as a functionally democratic workplace, as people are less likely to make decisions that negativly affect their own interests.\n \nI enjoy listening to Dr. Wolffs talks but I wouldn't call myself a Marxist-Wolffist, I admire his attemps to shoehorn socialism into the realm of commercial capitalism, but I myself have a hard time agreeing with anything short of a 1917 scenario. I also find it hard to label him a anarcho-syndicalist and especially a oppertunist. With so many personalities today being commercial oppertunists I can't really blame anyone thinking otherwise though. He could be selling himself to private entities or \"contributing\" to for-profit media outlets but is instead talking at monthly crowd funded non-profit events and hosting podcasts for the hell of it. In my eyes he is unfoutunetly our political vanguard.\n\nWhat makes Richard Wolff a anarcho-syndicalist?

Poverty is an inevitable result of the concentration of wealth coalescing at the top in the hands of a few individuals. This is ultimately how capitalism functions. If we began to reject the notion that private property is the inalienable right of whichever wealthy capitalists can afford to own it, we could radically alter who ultimately earns the product of labor. Instead of a few wealthy owners and landlords receiving increasingly more and more excessive profit margins, we could create a society where everyone benefits equally from the work we all do. Not everyone will have equalized results in any system. But we can at least ensure that workers aren't exploited by capitalists who retain profits and compensate workers a fraction of the wealth they've actually generated.\n\nIf every worker at, say, McDonald's got a share of profits equal to the wealth\/income they've generated, they wouldn't be paid minimum wage with no benefits. That's not to mention the workers who maintain the roads people drive on to get to McDonald's, the factory workers who made the cars people use to get there, etc. All of those people contributed to the profit mechanism of McDonald's, but McDonald's avoids taxes, hordes profit, and relies on a liberal welfare state subsidies to make up for their own failures to justly compensate the people who actually do the work. That's what capitalism does, and it has inherent contradictions that make it completely unsustainable.\n\nThis is an overly simplified example, but I feel it more or less explains what I believe.

Xue wrote that within the socialist mode of production there were several phases and for China to reach an advanced form of socialism it had to focus on developing the productive forces.He proposed a theory in which the basic laws of economic growth were those in which \"the relations of production must conform to the level of the productive forces\". Similarly to Stalin, Xue considered the productive forces to be primary and that this was a fundamental universal law of economics. Unlike Stalin, Xue believed there were principles that guided the socialist transition, the key one being the principle of \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his work\"; this principle would guide socialist development, even when China had reached advanced socialism, and would be replaced with \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need\" only when there existed general abundance.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Primary_stage_of_socialism","created_utc":1528310897,"score":13,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"AlienatedLabor","body":"I think we all agree that oppressed communities have the right to define their own terminology for things that relate to their own experiences. Just because femme and butch don't play as overwhelming a role in lesbian dating and don't determine which jobs you can get, which sexual roles you fill, etc. as they did in early 20th century working class lesbian bars doesn't mean that the word has been ceded. For instance, the term \"gatekeeping\" as well has a specific meaning within LGBT circles (despite it having other meanings outside those circles), specifically the restriction of available goods and services to those who need them, especially in the cases of gay\/bi men's access to HIV\/AIDS care and trans women's access to HRT. Just because gatekeeping doesn't function in the exact same frequencies in the exact same methods that it did in the AIDS crises similarly does not mean it ceases to mean that.\n\nIt's really tough to understand what someone means by \"femme\" if divorced from the community and experiences which formed it, since no definitions of it outside of lesbian circles really seem to be coherent. It has a lot of adverse effects when you remove it from this context. Far from being more inclusive of trans women, it feels really othering to insist that trans women aren't *really* women and that \"femme\" must be tacked on to really include them. It also seems to put a large focus on femininity as a decisive factor of women, as if butch lesbians and gnc women are somehow privileged for being masculine rather than punished for being gender-nonconforming. Some people even seem to allow \"femme\" to be used to describe cishet men!\n\nThe only case in which it seems to have a point is the inclusion of nonbinary people. In which case, the term \"woman-aligned\" exists to describe people who aren't women but have some sort of attachment to womanhood, whether it be political or otherwise \u2014 particularly nonbinary lesbians' attachment to womenhood because of their sexuality (what \"woman-aligned\" exactly means is different for any nonbinary person; I have a friend whose \"alignment\" is their identification with black womanhood, for instance).\n\n\"Non-men\" as a catch-all also works.","created_utc":1528320695,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Tim_Theory","body":"Thanks for the thoughtful response. I see the issue of 'femme' being used interchangeably with 'feminine'. I do think that there is some situational privilege associated with butch women, trans men, etc because masculinity is seen as aspirational - that's not to say that those groups don't face discrimination, only that it is in some cases mitigated by this attitude.\n\nAs for being othering of trans women, I guess I'd always assumed it would refer either to women and women-aligned or otherwise seriously feminine people (as a catchall) or to NB people who aren't comfortable with the term 'woman'. I can see how it could be interpreted by a trans woman as othering, though. On the other hand, I can imagine a NB or gender fluid person who is very feminine but would also feel excluded by the 'non-men' verbiage depending on their usual or incidental presentation or identification. 'Non-men', though it feels like efficient shorthand, also aesthetically starts as a negative instead of inviting those who are celebrating a shared identity, for whatever that's worth. \n\nAll that to say, you've given me food for thought. It's not for me to say one way or another how, eg, the non-men bike night communicates their offerings to the world, but I'll certainly be more mindful around such terms.

The transitioning period before communism. I can go more in depth, but meh.\n\nI'm not super informed about all the various things, but to start off I can answer a few things. (People, please correct me where I'm wrong!) \n\nFirst, in the Soviet Union, the majority of the  government was apart of  socialist-revolutionaries party. Which was actually founded in 1902. Amongst many things they also set up various Soviets (worker counsels, kinda like local boards of people). I believe Petrograd had the first one as of 1905. I'm not knowledgeable enough about the USSR as I should be. \n\nSecond, in China (I know a bit more about China than the USSR), there was an on going civil war that started roughly in the 20s. The Reds (as they were usually called) fought a guerrilla war against the Chinese government, whiles Japan was also at war with China. The Reds have land away to the peasants. Set up soviet governments all over. Set up healthcare, schooling, business. They actually controlled an immense amount of land in north west China, before the Chinese government finally made a peace treated do they could both fight Japan. Should be noted it, I don't believe Mao or anyone else called Red China during this time s stage of socialism. Read Edgar Snows personal account of this time in his \"Red Star over China\". It goes really in depth about the battles, the Long March, the position of Red China on Japan, and what they did in their part of China. It's a brilliant read.

There's no point in not calling resisting this feminism since that's what the historical actors themselves call it and call it today in Venezuela. If you think feminism is fundamentally a bourgeois or petty-bourgeois movement in practice that's fine but you then need to make the argument seriously and then explain why it is not progressive instead of automatically dismissing it across historical periods and political situations. Calling it \"unnecessary\" is meaningless since it exists and Marxists have to confront the world as it is and not how we wish it was.

It's usually subtle assumptions or the way I'm framing things in my head ahead of time that decide how I then feel.\n\nIt's often helped because having that comparison kind of shows that the stoics were right. There is no inherently depressing information as such, because somebody can always contextualise it differently and it's that frame of reference what makes it depressing or not. \n\nThe conclusion is that since a lot of these kinds of different worldviews are equally valid from a purely logical standpoint, it makes sense to move toward that which is easier or more importantly, more practical for, well, getting on.\n\nBasically I recommend taking after the stoics over Schopenhauer.\n\nNow I know that when you're depressed you can't exactly decide how you want to feel about something, but it's helped me just to remember that it's possible to feel otherwise in the same situation, and that there will most likely be some time in the future where you can feel that kind of contentment.\n\nMaybe you've heard this all before, but I just wanted to share anything that might help because what you describe is familiar to me and nobody should have be stuck in that kind of place cognitively.","created_utc":1528422901,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"BreachedHard","body":"He says obviously not because it is either one or the other.  Both socialism and capitalism are polar opposites of one another.  This is why taxing the rich to redistribute wealth won't solve anything.  If anything it just makes the system operate less efficiently, which is why so many right wing people can point to inefficiency in government.  Of course socialism doesn't play well with capitalism.\n\nYou either have one or the other.  There is either private property creating the class system or there is not.  Even the Soviet Union had \"state capitalism\", which I believe Lenin defended the concept when it was under attack, saying that state capitalism is good because it is the transition between capitalism and communism.\n\nAnd therein lies the real problem -- the ambiguity of the term \"socialism\".  It is very easy to justify both how China is socialist and is not socialist since both sides are working from different interpretations of the term.\n\nI think most people think of socialism as the transition between capitalism and communism.  I think most people also see socialism as encompassing communism, so the words are essentially interchangeable in most circumstances.\n\nThe real disagree here is precisely *when* we term something as socialism.  When have we dismantled capitalism to the point of socialism?  For many people, that answer is when private property is abolished, when commodity exchange no longer exists.\n\nBut the bottom line is -- there is no \"socialist capitalism\" or whatever.  So I would say the person you're responding to is technically correct.  It cannot be both capitalist and socialist.  I think it's easy to see that China is a capitalist country.\n\nI also think too many people are overly dismissive of state capitalism.  This is especially true for anarcists for obvious reasons (the existence of the state).\n\nThe better question would be if X country has achieved state capitalism.","created_utc":1528423658,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

The logistics of sending Venezuela rice from halfway across the world -- and not just as a symbolic gesture, but with the intent of genuinely remedying the situation -- is complex enough, before you think how it would be considered image-wise. \n\nThe situation in Venezuela is not a situation of famine or starvation, but from the outcries of the imperialist media, anyone would think that would be the case. China, along with Russia and a chorus of voices who are more critical of the narrative pushed by the CIA, has repeatedly made clear that they believe that there is no crisis in Venezuela that would [justify direct military intervention on the part of the United States](http:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/us-military-wants-invade-venezuela-has-invented-crisis-do-it-maduro-710249).

Frankly, it would be demeaning and degrading because humanitarian aid (not exchange or trade), is not something you do to equals - it's something you do to your subordinates. All humanitarian aid has string attached: without addressing the structural issues that Venezuela is confronting (the impossibility of a publicly-owned socialist system operating within, and dictated by, the framework of a market economy), it can only create dependency. If Venezuela is not a subordinate to the PRC at the moment (and the PRC certainly doesn't treat it like a subordinate), then doing so will transform their existing close diplomatic and economic relationships into one of subordination. Neither party wants that outcome.\n\nThese are just my thoughts on why I don't think the PRC will ever pursue a policy like this. \n","created_utc":1528440788,"score":15,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"corvibae","body":"That would depend on your definition of \"success\". Please note that not all communists agree about what communism is, but from the context of your question, I'll assume you are referring to the 20th century socialist states like the PRC, Cuba, and the Soviet Union. Please note that I'm a historian, not an economist, so my answer may be a bit fuzzy.\n\nSo, what seemed to work for China and the Soviet Union(rapid industrialization and nationalization) worked for them, in my opinion, because they were large, resource rich countries which had access to things like coal, iron, and other valuable natural resources. Cuba, for instance, while being fairly agriculturally wealthy, doesn't have the kind of natural resources that the USSR and PRC had\/have so their version of socialism has to be different. My basic answer here is that there is no one-size-fits-all socialism that will make a socialist nation successful. I'd argue that what would make a socialist nation the most successful is socialist revolutions in other countries. The big lesson that I feel should be learned from 20th century socialism is that the more successful anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist revolutions, the better. More socialist countries=a stronger network of allies to combat imperial-capitalist interference, and will help strengthen the cause in what Che referred to as \"the belly of the beast\".

{"author":"corvibae","body":"If you check the wiki of this subreddit, you will see that it is a pretty common tactic to inflate the numbers of people who died during the leadership of people like Mao and Stalin. But, I will say this, I'm not sure of your country of origin, but, if you live in the West, you'll have learned about the Great Depression. The Great Depression, while it was pretty bad here in the US, it was also significantly worse literally everywhere else in the world. This is combined with a bunch of economic events: floods in China, for example, famines in Eastern Europe.\n\nI know significantly less about the Chinese revolution than I do about Russia, so I'll just add this as an addendum. Most people who died in Russia around the time of the 1917 October Revolution which established the socialist state, you must understand, were already in a shitty situation. WWI may have really hurt everyone who was involved, but Russia took the brunt because Kaiser Wilhelm saw Russia as the greatest threat. The extensive requirements of fielding an army which was in the millions of men by the war's end caused a lot of food to be sent to the front, which was eventually lost as the Russians were pushed back in 1915-1916 and fell into German hands. Then from 1918-1921, there was a really terrible civil war in Russia. You may not know this, but about 100,000 of the troops that fought for the White(liberal\/monarchist) Army during the war consisted of British, French, German, Italian, and American troops. So, there was already a famine, things started to get better during 1917, but as soon as WWI ended in the rest of Europe, money starts pouring in to fund a civil war in a country that was already famished, leading to, you guessed it, more death and more famine. \n\nAgain, check this sub's wiki. It's a decent resource and includes a lot of debunking of common myths about socialism that are spread pretty regularly by liberal historians as the Gospel truth.

{"author":"corvibae","body":"I had a kind of unusual experience both as an undergraduate and as a graduate student. My university was every small ~15k students total, and my history department is even smaller, a total of 17 teachers about half and half full timers with professor rank and most of the MAs being adjuncts, but a couple with full time status as instructors. The number of history majors was even smaller, the year I graduated with my BA we had I think 6 undergraduates and 2 or 3 MAs, and when I got my MA we had a grand total of nine or ten majors graduate the program, this was last December. The semester I started at my university the State of Texas had stopped supporting the MA program and the university gave current MA students 4 years to graduate or else. \n\nSo, with that said, I was treated pretty damn well by most of my professors. The chair wasn't my biggest fan because she's a bit bourgeois, but so long as I was able to back up my use of historical materialism with facts and sources, I was respected. I became very close with three of my professors, one of whom was an anarchist, another who was a communist and had been imprisoned while he was at divinity school, and a third who was a Pan-Africanist. This is all at a very small university in Texas, of all places. \n\nSocially, most of the professors liked me and I ended up working inside the department both years of my graduate education. The environment wasn't toxic, unlike a lot of graduate programs in which students become kind of a sought after commodity for professors who are fighting for funding. It was small, so the program was significantly less competitive, and a strong sense of \"we're all in it together\" pervaded the grad and undergrad students alike. \n\nMy final semester of graduate school I actually was allowed to teach a class under the supervision of a professor for whom I have the utmost respect. This was, to remind you, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. Times were hard, so I ended up pulling quite a bit of weight in the classroom. What I found is that students are a lot more willing to question the government. We had a huge discussion about Eugene V. Debs and other American socialists who were arrested during the Red Scare in the 1910s, and they responded well. \n\nAs an undergraduate student and for a brief period as a graduate, I led my university's local YDSA chapter. It ended up not doing so well due to a variety of factors(a lot of our membership dropped out of college or graduated). The YDSA group on campus was more or less blacklisted, and I had to use my connections with the history department to get space where we could organize. \n\nOverall, my experience as a communist studying history was fairly good, but again, your mileage will vary, especially depending on the size and location of your university setting. My suggestion is to not overlook the smaller state schools. Just because they don't have Ivy league status does not mean that they do not provide a quality education and a good environment. Especially as an undergraduate major, there will be difficulties, especially things like scholarships and funding and limited class choices, however, I felt that the cons significantly outweighed the pros in my situation. Smaller class sizes, closer relationships with faculty and staff, and developing a camaraderie among your cohort is way more valuable. Grad school is hell, it's hard, it's not always fun, but it was worth it in my opinion. ","created_utc":1528471922,"score":14,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"doomdoomdrugsdoom","body":"&gt; Marxism is a fairly libertarian ideology.\n\nNah\n \n&gt; Why do the anti-authoritarians not confine themselves to crying out against political authority, the state? All Socialists are agreed that the political state, and with it political authority, will disappear as a result of the coming social revolution, that is, that public functions will lose their political character and will be transformed into the simple administrative functions of watching over the true interests of society. But the anti-authoritarians demand that the political state be abolished at one stroke, even before the social conditions that gave birth to it have been destroyed. They demand that the first act of the social revolution shall be the abolition of authority. Have these gentlemen ever seen a revolution? A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon \u2014 authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois? Should we not, on the contrary, reproach it for not having used it freely enough?\n\n&gt; Therefore, either one of two things: either the anti-authoritarians don't know what they're talking about, in which case they are creating nothing but confusion; or they do know, and in that case they are betraying the movement of the proletariat.

{"author":"4Phobos-me","body":"&gt; rallies like the one at Gazimestan  \n\n\nBy Jared Israel :\n\n&gt; We are told that this happened in Serbia. We are told that Slobodan Milosevic and other Serbian leaders indoctrinated the Serbian people to hate non-Serbs, especially ethnic Albanians in Kosovo province. We are told that Milosevic launched this racist campaign in a speech at Kosovo Field in 1989.\nThis charge made against Milosevic, that he preaches racial or ethnic hate, is significant because it supports the charge made against the Serbian people, that they were won to hatred and therefore practice genocide. Because many Americans and West Europeansbelieve these charges they are disposed to believe there must be some truth to the avalanche of pro-war propaganda demonizing the Serbs.\nSo. It is important to know exactly what Milosevic said in his speech at Kosovo Field. Yet nowhere do any of those who attack Milosevic's speech quote his words. Why not?\n\nThis speech ? : \n&gt; Serbia has never had only Serbs living in it. Today, more than in the past, members of other peoples and nationalities also live in it. This is not a disadvantage for Serbia. I am truly convinced that it is its advantage. National composition of almost all countries in the world today, particularly developed ones, has also been changing in this direction. Citizens of different nationalities, religions, and races have been living together more and more frequently and more and more successfully.\nSocialism in particular, being a progressive and just democratic society, should not allow people to be divided in the national and religious respect. The only differences one can and should allow in socialism are between hard working people and idlers and between honest people and dishonest people. Therefore, all people in Serbia who live from their own work, honestly, respecting other people and other nations, are in their own republic.\n\n&gt; After all, our entire country should be set up on the basis of such principles. Yugoslavia is a multinational community and it can survive only under the conditions of full equality for all nations that live in it.\nThe crisis that hit Yugoslavia has brought about national divisions, but also social, cultural, religious and many other less important ones. Among all these divisions, nationalist ones have shown themselves to be the most dramatic. Resolving them will make it easier to remove other divisions and mitigate the consequences they have created.For as long as multinational communities have existed, their weak point has always been the relations between different nations. The threat is that the question of one nation being endangered by the others can be posed one day -- and this can then start a wave of suspicions, accusations, and intolerance, a wave that invariably grows and is difficult to stop. This threat has been hanging like a sword over our heads all the time. Internal and external enemies of multi-national communities are aware of this and therefore they organize their activity against multinational societies mostly by fomenting national conflicts. At this moment, we in Yugoslavia are behaving as if we have never had such an experience and as if in our recent and distant past we have never experienced the worst tragedy of national conflicts that a society can experience and still survive.Equal and harmonious relations among Yugoslav peoples are a necessary condition for the existence of Yugoslavia and for it to find its way out of the crisis and, in particular, they are a necessary condition for its economic and social prosperity. In this respect Yugoslavia does not stand out from the social milieu of the contemporary, particularly the developed, world. This world is more and more marked by national tolerance, national cooperation, and even national equality. The modern economic and technological, as well as political and cultural development, has guided various peoples toward each other, has made them interdependent and increasingly has made them equal as well [medjusobno ravnopravni]. Equal and united\npeople can above all become a part of the civilization toward which mankind is moving. If we cannot be at the head of the column leading to such a civilization, there is certainly no need for us to be at is tail.\n\n&gt;Six centuries ago, Serbia heroically defended itself in the field of Kosovo, but it also defended Europe. Serbia was at that time the bastion that defended the European culture, religion, and European society in general. Therefore today it appears not only unjust but even unhistorical and completely absurd to talk about Serbia's belonging to Europe. Serbia has been a part of Europe incessantly, now just as much as it was in the past, of course, in its own way, but in a way that in the historical sense never deprived it of dignity. In this spirit we now endeavor to build a society, rich and democratic, and thus to contribute to the prosperity of this beautiful country, this unjustly suffering country, but also to contribute to the efforts of all the progressive people of our age that they make for a better and happier world.\nLet the memory of Kosovo heroism live forever!\nLong live Serbia!\nLong live Yugoslavia!\nLong live peace and brotherhood among peoples!\n\nemperors-clothes.com\/milo\/milosaid.html\n","created_utc":1528538771,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"4Phobos-me","body":"I wanted to copy more form the speech and it was just too big , so I'll encourage everyone to read it for themselves ( and look through the site , as it has large amounts of material). There is one necessary statement of Jared Israel I will leave here :\n\n&gt; Historical note\nby Jared Israel\nThis speech came at the culmination of a struggle in which millions of Serbs, Gypsies, Hungarians, Jews, Turks and other ethnic groups opposed the racist policies of the secessionist movement among Kosovo Albanians. For years the fascistic secessionists had dominated Kosovo; their persecution of other ethnic groups, especially Serbs and Roma (\"Gypsies\") is well documented; so is the multi-ethnic character of the mass movement against that persecution.\nWhat is so amazing about Milosevic's speech is he does not use the occasion of addressing a million people in Kosovo to advance a narrow ethnic agenda. He does not at any point attack ethnic Albanians. Instead he calls for reconciliation and mutual respect, citing the presence of different ethnic groups as Serbia's strength. Of course the speech does celebrate the existence of Serbia as a nation. But don't all national leaders celebrate the existence of their nations? The important point is he celebrates it as a multi-ethnic entity and that he never calls for the expansion of Serbian territory. Indeed, his point about the Kosovo Field battle of 1389 is that the Serbian army was morally superior and therefore victorious even in defeat, a rather sophisticated if melancholy viewpoint definitely over the head of the one-time Rhodes Scholar who is now Hustler-in-Chief of our own poor (though rich and powerful) country.\nBelow is a letter I just sent the Independent, a British paper:\nDear editor:\nIn his May 3 [1999] letter Stuart Russell presents NATO's claims of massive Serbian atrocities as proven and asserts government complicity because \"We have yet to hear any mention of Milosevic condemning, or even distancing himself from the atrocities.\"\nMilosevic told UPI on April 30th [1999]:  \n\"We are not angels. Nor are we the devils you have made us out to be. Our regular forces are highly disciplined. The paramilitary irregular forces are a different story. Bad things happened...

{"author":"RedIvies","body":"As for the question of medicare for all, there are a few  questions at play here. One is whether the state will take over not just insurers but providers. Another about whether we can trust the state, and a third about whether medicine is just a poisoned well like Foucault saw it. Personally I think saying universal healthcare is essential is correct because potentially the majority of capitalism's influence at this point may be providers being capitalist or non profit-industrial. I think we can trust the state with healthcare as much as we can with anything else (paying for education, having some commons, paying for maternity leave, etc). I reject the Foucault level of hate for medicine, I think it was true as an indictment of practices at the time and in some corners now, but was never particularly good analysis and it wanted the end of the discourse of medicine, not fixing the system. Anarchism is no answer in medicine either, and the individual is not magically the final arbiter of everything in medicine as we can see in vaccines or how too much care is provided (often to people's direct detriment) in the system now, even though I do think that people need more rights (and I would be open to hearing anarchist solutions to elder care). We can't simply surrender the state on every question and act like the revolution will just be creating a mass escape from capitalism through amateur organizations.\n\n\n&gt;It is one thing to set up a day care centre the way we want it, and demand that the State pay for it. It is quite another thing to deliver our children to the State and ask the State to control them, discipline them, teach them to honour the American flag not for five hours, but for fifteen or twenty-four hours. It is one thing to organise communally the way we want to eat (by ourselves, in groups, etc.) and then ask the State to pay for it, and it is the opposite thing to ask the State to organise our meals. In one case we regain some control over our lives, in the other we extend the State\u2019s control over us.\n\n&gt;\u2013Silvia Federici\n\nThis sounds off to me, personally, more just an anarchism with marxist trappings. Obviously in the tactical everyday fight it may look like this, but long term this seems like a bad framing. \n\n&gt;It is one thing to organise communally the way we want to eat (by ourselves, in groups, etc.) and then ask the State to pay for it\n\nThis seems almost petty in some ways. It reminds me of Foucault, not Marx. Where is the room for the workers state? What is the political place of organizing to eat alone? Schools and post offices and such are not socialism, but this seems like the squatters anarchist logic, that there is perennially this oppositional force, the rich, the state, that we really want to exist so we can make it pay. In reality want to workers to control, the workers to produce, and the workers to pay. I understand that we're not in that position now but I think a lot of left politics degenerates under this kind of conceptual framework. As for her saying \"the state will pay\" it strikes one as odd that she says \"the state\" and not the bourgeoisie, the rich, etc.","created_utc":1528657180,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"ogrelilly","body":"A bit of a different take on how to cope with it, as I understand that it may well be par for the course for those whom have yet to awaken their class consciousness, embracing Marxism(Leninism), the issue I'd like to address is addressing already won comrades, whom come off as brash, rude, arrogant and wildly confrontational with both comrades and non. These are the people that we, as comrades, must focus on when seeking to combat rudeness and disrespect.  It's a collection of pieces I'd come across, posted in some place on the internet, that really highlighted the problems with this seeming trend in certain areas.  I'll leave the piece as is, in full, with the introduction as I found it.  Here goes:\n\nA  collection of speech excerpts and quotes from Stalin, Lenin, and Xi  Jinping on just how Marxist\\-Leninists should strive to comport  themselves.  So often I see amongst comrades on Leftbook and other social  media sites, acting, to put it frankly, like complete and utter  reactionary, infantile, puerile assholes, reducing\/morphing the  socialist\/communist ideas into perverse oversimplifications of  themselves.  \u2013 it\u2019s quite counterproductive. To that point, the  collection:\n\nAn excellent speech by Stalin, where he speaks to the  exemplary qualities that Lenin displayed, qualities that every  Marxist\\-Leninist should strive to cultivate. A few excerpts are as  follows:\n\n\"Modesty\n\nI first met Lenin in December 1905 at  the Bolshevik conference in Tammerfors (Finland). I was hoping to see  the mountain eagle of our Party, the great man, great not only  politically, but, if you will, physically, because in my imagination I  had pictured Lenin as a giant, stately and imposing. What, then, was my  disappointment to see a most ordinary\\-looking man, below average height,  in no way, literally in no way, distinguishable from ordinary mortals. .  . .\n\nIt is accepted as the usual thing for a \u201cgreat man\u201d to come  late to meetings so that the assembly may await, his appearance with  bated breath; and then, just before the \u201cgreat man\u201d enters, the warning  whisper goes up: \u201cHush! . . . Silence! . . . he\u2019s coming.\u201d This ritual  did not seem to me superfluous, because it creates an impression,  inspires respect. What, then, was my disappointment to learn that Lenin  had arrived at the conference before the delegates, had settled himself  somewhere in a corner, and was unassumingly carrying on a conversation, a  most ordinary conversation with the most ordinary delegates at the  conference. I will not conceal from you that at that time this seemed to  me to be something of a violation of certain essential rules.\n\nOnly later did I realise that this simplicity and modesty, this striving  to remain unobserved, or, at least, not to make himself conspicuous and  not to emphasise his high position, this feature was one of Lenin\u2019s  strongest points as the new leader of the new masses, of the simple and  ordinary masses of the \u201crank and file\u201d of humanity.\n\nNo Whining\n\nThe second time I met Lenin was in 1906 at the Stockholm Congress of  our Party. You know that the Bolsheviks were in the minority at this  congress and suffered defeat. This was the first time I saw Lenin in the  role of the vanquished. But he was not in the least like those leaders  who whine and lose heart after a defeat. On the contrary, defeat  transformed Lenin into a spring of compressed energy which inspired his  supporters for new battles and for future victory. I said that Lenin was  defeated. But what sort of defeat was it? You had only to look at his  opponents, the victors at the Stockholm Congress\u2014Plekhanov, Axelrod,  Martov and the rest. They had little of the appearance of real victors,  for Lenin\u2019s merciless criticism of Menshevism had not left one whole  bone in their body, so to speak. I remember that we, the Bolshevik  delegates, huddled together in a group, gazing at Lenin and asking his  advice. The speeches of some of the delegates betrayed a note of  weariness and dejection. I recall that to these speeches Lenin bitingly  replied through clenched teeth: \u201cDon\u2019t whine, comrades, we are bound to  win, for we are right.\u201d Hatred of the whining intellectual, faith in our  own strength, confidence in victory\u2014that is what Lenin impressed upon  us. It was felt that the Bolsheviks\u2019 defeat was temporary, that they  were bound to win in the very near future.\n\n\u201cNo whining over  defeat\u201d\u2014this was the feature of Lenin\u2019s activities that helped him to  rally around himself an army faithful to the end and confident in its  strength.\n\nNo Boasting\n\nAt the next congress, held in 2907  in London,3 the Bolsheviks proved victorious. This was the first time I  saw Lenin in the role of victor. Victory turns the heads of some leaders  and makes them haughty and boastful. They begin in most cases to be  triumphant, to rest on their laurels. But Lenin did not in the least  resemble such leaders. On the contrary, it was precisely after a victory  that he became especially vigilant and cautious. I recall that Lenin  insistently impressed on the delegates: \u201cThe first thing is not to  become intoxicated by victory and not to boast; the second thing is to  consolidate the victory; the third is to give the enemy the finishing  stroke, for he has been beaten, but, by no means crushed.\u201d He poured  withering scorn on those delegates who frivolously asserted: \u201cIt is all  over with the Mensheviks now.\u201d He had no difficulty in showing that the  Mensheviks still had roots in the working\\-class movement, that they had  to be fought with skill, and that all overestimation of one\u2019s own  strength and, especially, all underestimation of the strength of the  enemy had to be avoided.\n\n\u201cNo boasting in victory\u201d\u2014this was the  feature of Lenin\u2019s character that helped him soberly to weigh the  strength of the enemy and to insure the Party against possible  surprises.\" \\- Stalin, January 28, 1924, \"A Speech Delivered at a  Memorial Meeting of the Kremlin Military School\"\\[[https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/\u2026\/arch\u2026\/stalin\/works\/1924\/01\/28.htm\\]](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/\u2026\/arch\u2026\/stalin\/works\/1924\/01\/28.htm])\n\nComrade Xi Jinping with some words on how Party officials and members should strive to comport themselves:\n\n\u201cOur officials are officials of the Party, and their power is granted  by the Party and the people. Thus, they should...conduct themselves in a  modest and prudent manner free from arrogance and rashness.\n\nParty members must always behave in a proper manner, scrutinize  themselves, keep alert to \u201cresist the myriad temptations of the dazzling  world,\u201d and be honest and hardworking, clean and upright.\u201d \\-Xi Jinping,  Train and Select Good Officials,6\/28\/13\n\n\u201cIt is my keenly felt  conviction that an attitude of equality and modesty is required...\u201d \\- Xi  Jinping, Exchanges and Mutual Learning Make Civilizations Richer and  More Colorful, 3\/27\/14\n\n\u201cOnce more we should educate Party members  and officials, and guide them in keeping to the \u201ctwo musts\u201d : The \u201ctwo  musts\u201d refer to \u201cour comrades must remain modest and prudent, neither  conceited nor rash, in our working practices; and our comrades must  remain hardworking despite difficulties in our working practices.\u201d They  were proposed by Mao Zedong in the Report to the Second Plenary Session  of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC. At the time, the CPC was  about to win state power nationwide. Mao cautioned the whole Party on  standing the test of exercising governance and against arrogance and  complacency, love of pleasure and estrangement from the people that  would end the rule of the CPC.\u201d \\- Xi Jinping, The Guiding Thoughts and  Goals for the Program of Mass Line Education and Practice, 6\/18\/13\n\n\u201cWhen talking about cultivating morality, one needs to have high  ambitions as well as pragmatic plans...one needs to cultivate public and  personal virtues, learn to work, to be thrifty, to be grateful, to help  others, to be modest, to be tolerant, to examine oneself and to  exercise self\\-restraint.\u201d \\- Xi Jinping, Young People Should Practice the  Core Socialist Values, 5\/4\/14\n\nAn excerpt from a Lenin work. It  speaks, too, to how vituperative language, generally speaking, has  little to no use (in politics), and just what it's use signifies:\n\n\u201cCan abusive language have political significance?\n\nUndoubtedly....in politics abusive language often serves as a screen  for utter lack of principles and sterility, impotence, angry impotence,  on the part of those who use such language.\n\nThat is all there is to it.\u201d \\- Lenin, June 24th 1914\n\n\\[[https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/lenin\/works\/1914\/jun\/24.htm\\]](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/lenin\/works\/1914\/jun\/24.htm])","created_utc":1528673453,"score":13,"subreddit":"communism"}

All beings outside the realm of whiteness are seen as mere creatures who conform to tropes ascribed to them by western European society. The civilized white is a free thinking being, and the other little more than a high functioning animal. Most of these ideas sprang up in the 15th century with the rise of colonialism. Of course these ideas have evolved in various different ways over the years; from religious justifications, to social, to economic, to scientific and so on. In my opinion modern racism is an amalgamation of all these.\n\nThankfully anti-racist ideas have also arose and evolved along with them, but they have always been on the back foot due to the other structures of oppression which reinforce the historical power structures still prevalent to this day.\n\nDingo's comment about race as a scapegoat for many Fascist government is apt, but their positions were not unique. The Nazi's basically got their racial program from the scholars in the US. And while they were particularly anti semitic; historically speaking such views were held by pretty much every western country going back more than a thousand years.

{"author":"smexy_stalin17","body":"In my opinion, Russia is rightfully justified to annex the peninsula, I'll give you some facts and history of the region for you to form your own opinion about this issue though. Now the Crimean Peninsula (what Russia annexed in their 'invasion) is a piece of land in southern Ukraine, and has historically been a part of the Russian Empire since 1783-1917. After the Russian Revolution it changed hands a number of times, but was fully incorporated into the RSFSR by 1921 anyway, and continued to be until it was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR in 1954 as a result of the many similarities and close proximity between the Crimea and the Ukrainian SSR. For a bit of history in the past days of the Crimea, the Crimean War (1853-1856) war devastated much of the area's fertile lands. During rule under the U.S.S.R. the Crimea was subject to Greek culture repression in hopes of Russification the area, and it also experienced a quite well known famine, the Holodomor. Normally, this would just be another tragic famine, except this was man-made by the process of Stalin's forced collectivization (not blaming communism to be clear). This famine's death toll is usually exaggerated by people who oppose communism and the number varies, but we know that it at least cost hundreds of thousands to millions of Ukrainian, Tatar, and Russian lives. Post-WW2, Crimean Tatars were also deported on a massive scale due to accusations of collaboration with the Nazis in the occupying of the region. This has of course caused some grudges against Russia, and although I believe they should be grudges against Stalin myself, I can't change that right now. Anyways, taking all of this into consideration why would the Crimea want to rejoin Russia? The simple answer is because the Ukrainian government is inept and has not been able to do its simple job to the citizens of Ukraine or Crimea, while the Russian government can bring much wealth and economic development and opportunity to the peninsula, not to mention Russia has much more money, is more modern, and is more internally stable than Ukraine. The people themselves had to rebel in the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. Before I get ahead of myself however, these are but a few examples of Ukraine's unskillful government: Widespread corruption in Ukraine, to the extent of being called a kleptocracy by U.S. diplomats, lack of economic growth, not being able to handle the unrest caused by pro-Russian sentiment in Donbass, and reportedly violated the Minsk peace agreements (albeit so have the separatists) with the Russian-backed separatists of the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic multiple times. \nN.A.T.O. themselves also have a big part in this. A joint-N.A.T.O. drill with Ukrainian military forces and the imperialist U.S. caused a protest by rightfully anti-N.A.T.O. citizens, which lasted until the drill was canceled. Adding new members to N.A.T.O. obviously will antagonize Russia, and putting the membership of Ukraine off for a later date practically forces Russia to respond one way or another, it just so happens that this was in the form of military intervention in a region important to Russia historically(the sieges of Sevastopol, partisan activity in WW2, etc.) strategically(warm-weather trade ports that will not freeze, albeit put in a Mediterranean stranglehold by Turkey being in N.A.T.O., the military port of Sevastopol, etc.) and even religiously somewhat due to the Orthodox Church associations(see the Holy Baptism of Prince Vladimir\/Vladimir the Great).","created_utc":1528754134,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"11-22-1963","body":"There was no Russian invasion or intervention in the Ukraine. \n\nIn regards to Crimea specifically, there was no invasion. The troops that were in Crimea were already legally stationed there, *vis a vis* Russia's naval base in Sevastopol which it had an agreement to lease from Ukraine after the fall of the Soviet Union. The troops also only engaged in limited fighting *only after* Crimea legally became part of Russia, and it was quickly secured. \n\nThere was no invasion force in Crimea or eastern Ukraine, if there were the whole of Ukraine's military would collapse in a couple days, maybe even hours. Further, you'd have verifiable satellite evidence of troop movements, etc.\n\nGeorgia attacked Russian peacekeeping troops in South Ossetia and the army collapsed in one day against a *much worse* Russian military comparatively, in 2008. I think Russia sent not even a full division. I shudder to think how quickly Ukraine would fall if current Russia actually invaded it. \n\n**[This article by Dmitri Orlov explains how the situation would look if Russia invaded Ukraine.](http:\/\/cluborlov.blogspot.com\/2014\/08\/how-can-you-tell-whether-russia-has.html)**\n\nRegards Crimea's \"annexation\", prior to the referendum, [Crimea's elected Parliament adopted a resolution declaring independence from the Ukraine.](https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/crimea-parliament-independence-ukraine-086\/) It then held the referendum, which was observed by thirty countries IIRC. Those who follow the \"annexation\" narrative will say the referendum was rigged because there was no option to remain in the Ukraine; what's omitted is that Crimea had already declared independence when the referendum was held. \n\nThe argument that this declaration was illegal; or that prior consultation with the central Kiev government was required is not valid because the United Nations (I believe it's the founding Charter) recognizes the right to sovereignty and independence. This was invoked when Kosovo split off from Serbia, and nobody got to vote there. A declaration of independence with recognition from a state is *de jure* valid. \n\nTL;DR: There was no Russian invasion of Crimea. Crimea acceded to the Russian Federation through referendum after declaring independence from the Ukraine. Crimea's declaration of independence and its accession are legal under international and Russian law, given the precedent of Kosovo and Catalonia. \n\nRegards \"Russian troops\" in eastern Ukraine, those don't exist either. Refer to Orlov's article, and the fact that such evidence of an invasion-level force would be easily verified. There are Russian-speaking Ukrainian volunteers, ex-Russian military conscripts, but there are no actively serving Russian troops, no special forces. Not even advisers. The troops in Crimea were legally stationed there already. \n\nFurther info:\n\n* **[War in Ukraine](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLQfP9J3uUJY8DZj6q87sbTnNYtOQ0YqhL)** -- a video series which gives further context of the conflict in Ukraine.

As someone, who is living in Ukraine I can tell you that now that stalemate in eastern Ukraine is just source of income to the high officials on both sides. The houses got maraudered(by both countries), the cars and property got stolen, and people dying because of almost non-regulated use of artillery. The Russian population obviously not so happy seeing that they relatives got stuck in this kind of humanmill, so as Ukranian one. But the russian government can use that conflict to justify A LOT of expenses, stolen by oligarchs obviously. The same happening on Ukranian side obviously. \n\nOverall this conflict is complete and utter loss of working class conciousness to the \"bourgeoisie of 21 century\"- while the egoistic jackasses keep pouring money in their pockets, the population is rusting in it's inability to do something about it. Sounds naive? But it's exactly what's going on. You can lookup for the journalistic researches on the corrupcy in high executives. And the oligarchs have developed very intelligent strategy of suppressing the population will for equality: induce the psychotic rightwing tendencies in population of both countries. Pro-nazi in Ukraine keeps shouting that Russians are devil's, pro-nazi in Russia keeps shouting that ukranians are eating children's on breakfast(and I'm not joking), from both sides the internet and hate speech bots used to create hysteria towards each other. In that masquarade the ordinary people lost their ability to navigate themselves: and to the end of day the communism got banned in the Ukraine, and in Russia they shifting from communistic views towards the religion. Again, you can check this up on your own investigation.\n\nThe Crimea is not an issue - they had prorussian tendencies a lot time ago, so it's not like it was unexpected by Ukranian population that referendum was in favor of it. I highly doubtful that it was 97% though, but obviously the crimean population have leaned towards it. I believe it's would be right to have an referendum BEFORE the armed people have taken over its territory. Is Russian activity towards Crimea justified? From the geopolitical and cultural perpective- of course. Do the actions that they have taken justified from humanity perspective? Of course not. But interesting thing that current situation would not be possible without the cooperation between high executives from both sides. \n\nAsk questions if you want to hear more explanation, and anyone can debunk me obviously.

{"author":"yungsatire666","body":"Anarcho\\-Communism What an ideology The anarchist movement has had a long history and many ups and downs. There have been many anarchist movements that have been interesting and had a far reaching affect on political philosophy but none have been as influential as the great Chinese Anarcho\\-Communist movement! The first notable anarchists were the Taoists in sixth century B.C. Although the Taoists were far more freedom lovering than the big government Confucians, we real anarchists despise the Taoists \u2018free society.\u2019 Our anarchist beliefs stem from the more modern Marxian anarchist movement. Although there has been much tension and confusion over who is a real anarchist and who is a national socialist, we Anarcho\\-Communists are entirely separate from the national socialists, although we are in near unanimous opinion. Now the capitalists love to tell you how evil communism is and how many people communism has killed. But we Anarcho\\-Communists are very different, it has taken us decades to crystallize what it is exactly that makes us different, and we are not 100&amp;#37; sure yet, however we have a few ideas. The goal and ultimate state of communism is classless and therefore stateless, so we are told. Now Anarcho\\-Communism is pretty much the same thing but it\u2019s different trust me. The largest difference between us and the big C Communists is that they believe guns should be confiscated by the state. We, quite opposed, believe that the collective should confiscate the guns. Major difference. The only question is what would happen if the collective didn\u2019t want to give up its guns, then only part of the collective would take the guns, the collective with guns who don\u2019t want the other part to have guns for their best interests. But it\u2019s anarchy so nobody would be coerced into anything unless it was by the collective, entirely different from a state.  Probably the only serious difference we were able to find is not in the actually society in that of a Communist opposed to Anacho\\-Communist, but in that of how to get to the classless beautifully equal society. Us anarchists do not believe in a transitional state between wretched capitalism and lovely communism, that\u2019s the difference between us and the Communists. We anarchists believe in the same communist nation that the Communists believe in however we do not believe that a Communist state is necessary to achieve this beautiful socialist tranquility. Some economists say we are even stupider than the Communists, so we burn cars sometimes. Anarcho\\-Communism is actually a great thing for the world for two reasons: 1. We are super not the same as those Communists who were at fault for a hundred million lives. 2. Communism has been good for the world. To quote a comrade: \u201cMao was a some\\-what supporter of Anarchism. He just didn't agree with Anarchists on how to achieve it. Either way, Anarchism=Communism ; Communism=Anarchism, whether you're a Anarchist or a Communist.\u201d Boom totally different do you see now comrade! It has been quite difficult to really separate all the Communists into different categories. We are still unsure how North Korea fits in with all this, but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an easy connection to North Korea being a free dictatorship. For the most part, us comrades have a clear understanding of the difference subconsciously: \u201cleninst are not my comrades like i said before and they can only play a counter revolutionary roll in a revolutionary situation. and don't fucking threaten me It's not a threat, it's the truth of what will happen if you don't trust fellow comrades surrounding you, fighting with you. And I don't care if you don't see them as your comrades, because they see you as a comrade. I'm a Marxist\\-Leninist &amp; I see every anarchist as a comrade of mine. Leninists are the fags to you as a U.S. soldier. Biased to the end &amp; stuck in the past.\u201d So comrades, now that you clearly understand what separates us from the other communists, I am going to talk about the revolution. When the revolution happens, how are we Anarcho\\-Communists going to separate ourselves from the others when it is time to fight then time to create society. The first move to actually start the revolution is to act as antifa. We have to destroy cars and fight fascism. Once we gather enough support (because acting like antifa is a respectable thing to do) we will raise an official army by collecting donations of guns. We would never buy guns from capitalists so we would need donations, good thing pulling an antifa is a support generating act. Once we comrades are armed we will rage against the enemy, the enemy  being the capitalists and everyone who does not join the cause. There will be beautiful battles on the steps of capitalist edifices. Once we have completed the revolution, we will be tasked with founding society. This is where things could go to shit comrades we must be careful.","created_utc":1528915985,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

By opening up the DPRK will be able to profit by producing all kinds of things for international markets: coal, cell phones, etc. They'll be able to utilize their geographic importance between China and South Korea for diplomatic and commercial purposes. Like Trump said \"North Korea may choose to open its beautiful shoreline to tourism\". The benefits are endless for Korea. China is proof in motion that opening your borders to trade is a necessary and positive thing, and if done correctly it has the possibility of ushering in socialist growth of a kind previously understood as impossible.

How did monopoly capitalism \"get what it wants\"? I don't think the imperialists are happy and you might agree with this if you watched the news or Trump's press conference in Singapore: Democrats are outraged and even Republicans are skeptical and unprepared for these developments.

{"author":"[deleted]","body":"&gt;How did a 'triumphant' economy economy collapse in less than 50 years?\n\nSee pages 1202 to the end. \n\nTo summarize:\n\nHigh military expenditures after 1957 hurt development in agriculture and hurt the amount of investment going into productive fixed assets. The number of planning indicators declined after 1953. I will now quote the author:\n\n&gt;terms. But by picturing the make-up of the national economic plan at that time we can\nassume that it was primarily a matter of reducing the number of physical indicators\nby aggregating them and also reducing the number of directive norms for use of\nmaterials and labour. Aggregation and reduction of directive physical indicators freed\nministries to make relative cuts in production of products which were disadvanta-\ngeous for them from the point of view of profitability or complexity of manufacture\nwithout regard for the needs of consumers and the economy. The reduction in the\nnumber of norms set for use of materials allowed them to 'ensure' the lowering of\nproduction costs by reducing quality and manipulating the product mix. As a whole,\nthese measures led to growing disproportions in the economy's development, a\nslow-down in scientific and technical progress, which was not supplied with the\nnecessary materials and equipment, and a fall in the efficiency of production. In return\nthey made life notably easier for senior managers by weakening control over their\nactivities.\n\nIn addition, many qualified leaders in the economy were replaced by more incompetent ones after Stalin's death.\n\nAfter Stalin, state supervisory functions also declined. I will quote again:\n\n&gt;After 1953 there was a sharp weakening of the state's supervisory functions in the\neconomy. The totally justified and timely reduction of the punitive function of the\nMVD in the political sphere was accompanied by a similar reduction, if not abolition,\nof that function in the economic sphere, where it had played a positive role by\nproviding the political leadership with objective information about the state of affairs\nin the economy. This reduction was entirely in the interests of the economic\nnomenklatura, a considerable part of which wanted a lack of supervision so they\ncould both paint a favourable picture of the situation and enrich themselves. At the\nsame time, there was a reduction in economic supervision by other control organs (the\nprocuracy, the ministry of state control and departmental control organs). In other\nwords, the control system which is absolutely essential for any centralised system, and\nespecially in the command economy, where control by the market is absent, was to\na significant degree dismantled in the 1950s. When the dangerous consequences of\nthis were partially recognised at the beginning of the 1960s and more careful checking\nof the activities of economic organisations and organs of power began, a very\nsignificant level of corruption and abuse was revealed. Around 12,000 leading\npersonnel, including 4,000(!) party workers, were brought to court then for these\nabuses.44 The weakening of control by the centre was named by Mancur Olson as the\nmajor reason for the steep decline in efficiency of the command economy after the\ndeath of Stalin: 'As soon as communist power began to be dispersed communism was\ndoomed to collapse'\n\n...\n\n&gt;The weakening of the state's control functions was not accompanied by the\nappearance of either market control mechanisms or sufficiently effective forms of\nsocial control. Some efforts to create and strengthen social control were undertaken\nin this period. The role of the press as an organ of social control increased, its voice\nbecame sharper and demanded a response, letters to the press were checked by state\norgans, the role of the party and trade union organs in control over administration\nincreased somewhat, and new social control organs appeared. But all these innova-\ntions proved rather ineffective and only partly compensated for the weakening in the\nrole of state control organs.\n\nIn the second half of the 1950s ill thought-through and hasty economic reforms\nwere carried out, which seriously worsened the management of economic life. I will quote again:\n\n&gt;Although the branch system of management had many shortcomings (departments\nwere too closed and little account was taken of local peculiarities), the system of\nmanagement of industry and construction introduced in its place in 1957 had even\nmore (localism, loss of management of branches as a whole, and territories now\nbecame closed). It seriously obstructed the management of scientific and technical\nprogress.\n\n&gt;The sale of agricultural machinery from the machine-tractor stations (MTS) to the\nkolkhozy and sovkhozy meant that it was less intensively used and also worsened the\nfinancial position of agricultural enterprises and the rural population. In a number of\neconomists' opinion (G. Yavlinsky, for example), the abolition of the review of\nlabour norms in 1954 seriously impeded the possibility of raising labour productiv-\nity. To these major mistakes must be added the abolition of the centralised system\nof management of material-technical supply in 1953 and the dissolution of the\nsectoral bureaux of the USSR Council of Ministers in the same year, which made\nmanagement of the major economic complexes more difficult. All together, the rather\nharmonious and viable system of economic management which had proved itself in\nthe 1940s and the beginning of the 1950s was seriously shaken and disorganised by\nall these reforms.\n\n&gt;The disorganisation of economic management was also caused by the strengthening\nof party organs' role in managing the economy. Since the end of the 1930s dual\npower of state and party organs in economic management had been replaced by single\npower of state organs. This was also reflected in the increased role of the government\nat the expense of the CPSU Central Committee, which in turn was reflected in the\ncomposition of the Politbureau, in which the role of state leaders grew more and\nmore, at the expense of party leaders. The culmination of the struggle between state\nand party organs over management of the economy and other spheres of social life\nwas the July 1957 plenum of the Central Committee, at which it was mainly the\nleaders of state departments who came out on the side of the so-called anti-party\nopposition, while party workers, dissatisfied with the contraction of their role in\nmanagement of the state, supported Khrushchev. Khrushchev's victory in this struggle\nmeant a new strengthening of the party's role in the appointment of economic leaders\nand current management of the economy. Whilst any dual power in economic\nmanagement is fatal, the damage done by this dual power was augmented by the fact\nthat the qualifications of party leaders, necessarily detached from direct management\nof the economy, were poorer than those of economic leaders.\n\nThat was a summary of what caused the decline of USSR after 1958.","created_utc":1529088899,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

Such an enemy must be known to perfection, from every angle.

It does not compete for the same class forces as socialism and it cannot be won over by proletarian class consciousness. It is a racist and reactionary which is fundamentally in the class interest of racists and reactionaries, and increasing the class consciousness of white settlers and petty-bourgeois elements will only increase fascism, not decrease it.

In itself democracy has nothing to do with capitalism.\n\nWhat we have is a representation of democracy, a replica of what we imagine democracy to be. This is how the \"our democracy is not perfect, but we'll get there\" claim can be made. The liberal concept of democracy is a nebulous ideal that serves the purpose of creating the illusion of a democratic society. But while one would think that the intent is to reach that ideal, the system instead is built to maintain the ideal as far away from reality as possible.\n\nThis is also how the \"not real socialism\" meme gained such traction with non-communists. Socialist theory is a materialist theory, it does not make use of abstract constructions to make sense of reality and as such it does not fall in the \"replica\" trap. It was not socialism because we knwo what socialism is.

{"author":"DeLaProle","body":"I don't think you're going to get to this person by throwing tomes at him. At the risk of sounding pretentious, people who like Jordan Peterson aren't really known for their fondness of reading. He owes his fame to a specific demographic watching him on youtube. If you try to get Peterson fans to read Capital their eyes will glaze over by the third time they see \"20 yards of linen\" (I know mine did the first time I tried reading Capital).   \n  \nI think in order to get to these people you have to play their game, in a sense. You must know their positions, but also know the subject enough to be able to pick their arguments apart on a person-to-person basis (ie not just saying \"read this\"). Secondly I think, as you have attempted to do with Richard Wolff, you need to offer them alternatives in a medium that attracted them to Peterson in the first place i.e. video lectures\/interviews offering easy to understand explanations to complex social problems, because these are the sorts of people who prefer simple, incorrect explanations to correct but complicated ones. The left has not really been offering competition (though this seems to be slowly changing from what I hear) to this youtube-ization of political discourse. I put this down to an attitude that we have of such media being *beneath* us, to the left being so fractured (many not wanting to \"support\" anyone outside their tendency) but also more significantly the fact that, as a leftist, learning theory constantly produces an overwhelming feeling that you don't quite know enough yet.   This makes it difficult for us to offer other people these sorts of simplistic explanations in authoritative tones of which the right is, naturally, an unscrupulous, opportunistic peddler. Unfortunately I'm not a big follower of youtube so I'm not really up to date on *youtube personalities* of the left (I know ContraPoints, who has a video on Peterson, is supposed to represent a growing leftist presence on youtube) but more specifically when it comes to a Jordan Peterson figure (not really a youtuber but an academic who has a lot of talks\/lectures\/interviews people follow on youtube) the closest figures the broad left seems to have is like Chomsky or Zizek or Wolff. Unfortunately Chomsky can be a bit dry and is more for calling out the US as an empire while Zizek can be a bit all over the place and is probably incomprehensible to those who aren't already familiar with his style. Richard Wolff is pretty good as someone who provides entry-level Marxian economic analysis but he doesn't really get beyond this often (though I haven't really followed him for a couple of years). Someone to watch I think is Yanis Varoufakis who was an academic for years, quietly contributing to game theory and economics, but in recent years he has been gathering a following and traveling worldwide to give lectures and such. He's a libertarian Marxist, so I disagree with some of his views, but he is very good at boiling down complex theories and the history of political\/economic thought, providing a simple way to understand them; for example [the beginning of this lecture](https:\/\/youtu.be\/gGeevtdp1WQ?t=113) he breaks down primitive accumulation and the genesis of capitalism, private property, labor as a commodity, and industrial and financial capital which of course debunks the idea that capitalists have gotten where they are by hard work and enterprise but by a historical process.

Instead of channeling this dissatisfaction towards the actual source of their woes, these people are turned towards the symptoms of their problems, with his politics becoming a secondary subversive thing after they are drawn in by the promises of an improved lifestyle. \n\nWe need someone that can relate with people on the practical level, someone as charismatic as Peterson, and with the intellectual background to boot. It's not simply about the intellectual background, it's that he has that, AND he rejects the intellectual institutions that makes him so compelling. People no longer respect merely the fact that you're an intellectual anymore, they need to be able to trust you and they definitely do not trust academia. Someone like Contrapoints, while she has those factors, lacks the relatability. Most people can't relate with the transgender struggle, and so it turns away the same pools that are accessed by someone like Peterson. There are other youtube personalities that have the relatability and the intellectual capacity, but lack the charisma.

This is just a fact. \n\nSome of those hard working people are entrepreneurs under capitalism. There is no point pretending that a lot of these guys don't work hard and have excellent organisational skills. They do. Those skills are valuable for any mode of production.\n\nHowever, the lionisation of entrepreneurs for their hard work is a distraction from several important facts:\n\n1. For an entrepreneur to succeed, he must employ other people who often work just as hard as he does, or harder, and keep a portion of the value they produce for himself. The fact that he works hard himself is no justification for that.\n\n2. Most capitalists are not entrepreneurs, but have inherited capital and live off the proceeds. They do not work, or if they do it is pretty much recreational, and the actual process of production is organised by professional managers who are employees, albeit highly paid ones that will often invest their massive wages to buy capital and become capitalists themselves. \n\n3. Succeeding as an entrepreneur in the first place is much more likely if you were born a couple of rungs up the ladder. Financial acumen is passed on from parent to child through the social environment, and the stress of poverty leads people to make irrational financial decisions. (There is research on this, but I couldn't be bothered finding it.) And if you have a safety net and initial capital in the form of the bank of mom and dad, you can more easily start to think about taking financial risks such as starting a business that may not work out, or, if it does, may require you to live without wages for an extended period of time.

For context, from 1975 to 1977, per capita grain output had largely stagnated. By 1978, the year that the commune system was reorganised, per capita production was still below the level it had been in the 1950s. The last peak had been in 1957. The combination of a growing population and a diminishing food supply was causing people to worry that another famine would happen.\n\nBy 1979, one year after the CPC's reorganisation of agriculture (replacing the commune system with the joint township-collective-household system), per capita grain output had reached the highest level in Chinese history. From 1978 to 1985, the gross value of agricultural output doubled. In the same time period, per capita net income of peasant households swelled from \u00a5134 to \u00a5397. This progress has continued. (Note that the PRC conducted smaller experiments with agricultural reorganisation first in volunteer towns before rolling it out across the entire country once the results came back - it was a change based on scientific practice.)\n\nRelative to the rest of the Global South? China is now lifting around 13 million people in rural areas out of poverty on an annual basis. It has accomplished this through planned, well-proportioned socialist development, balanced urbanisation, infrastructure development, targeted and meticulous relief programmes, rural-urban integration, and continual improvements in mechanisation of agriculture. From 2000 to 2016, annual per capita disposable income has increased by 448% in rural households, which far exceeds the level obtained by any other country (except maybe Vietnam or Laos).","created_utc":1529205705,"score":42,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"goodlad36","body":"&gt;But what did distribution according to need actually mean?\rDid it mean everything to be distributed free in the quantities anyone wanted?\rEarlier Soviet documents had said this[Svetlov and Bukharin, 1926]. The 1961 program's emphasis on abundance could certainly lead many readers to interpret it this way, but it was remarkably unspeci c. The whole idea was based on a slim passage by Marx [1970].\rThe section on communism in the CPSU programme has to be seen as an expansion and elaboration of a few paragraphs in this letter. But what does 'to each according to his need' mean. To understand this you have to look at the previous paragraphs. This brings out that when talking about need Marx was referring to something quite speci c: that di erent workers have di erent needs. Some have families some do not, some have more children than others. Thus even equal hourly pay rates would leave some families and individuals better o  than others. To each according to need in this context means that those with children should be paid more than those who are single. Those with speci c disabilities which give rise to special needs should be compensated. These are now very familiar principles to us. They lie at the foundation of the welfare state with child bene ts, family tax credits, disability living allowances, medical treatment on the basis of need etc. What Marx was saying is that as society becomes richer it will be able to a ord a much more comprehensive and generous welfare provision. And who can now doubt that he is right. Rich France can provide a welfare state that would be totally infeasible in poor Co\u0302te d'Ivoire. \nBut it is important to note that there is no suggestion in what Marx wrote here, or in his economic writings, that he was an advocate of general free distri- bution.

Much easier to imagine keeping everything you own as nature-given \"personal property\" than a true democratic community exposing the pure parasitism and wastefulness of your life. Not only do we have the ability to create communism now, we had it in Marx's time, which is why he wrote in the first place. The answer to \"how would production and distribution occur\" under communism is extremely obvious: it would be determined democratically by the whole of society. But oppressors are not fans of democracy since they are always in the minority. Better to imagine a peaceful resolution of the global imbalance in production and distribution through abundance.\n\nE: you may be making the opposite point, the quote is very unclear.

{"author":"possiblegoat","body":"I'm a former member of the National Committee of the SP-USA. Since we try to avoid sectarianism here, I'll give you some concrete criticisms instead of just my personal opinion.\n\n* Almost all the money they take in goes to the presidential campaign, and a whole lot of their own members don't even vote for the candidate they run. So working with the SP is like doing pointless busywork -- get donations, get signatures for ballot access, get a paltry number of votes, nothing changes, do it all again next time! I'm not opposed to election work when the work itself organizes people and builds community power, but the SP national model doesn't do that at all -- just pick a candidate (haphazardly, I should add) get them on some news shows, and then lose four years worth of resources. A waste of your dues, and they are so broke from this model that they stopped publishing hardcopies of their paper, which actually did help build the org.\n\n* The national was not super friendly to women when I was a member. After we elected someone with pending sexual assault charges to an important position, a woman raised the issue and was told that she was so irrational that she must have been assaulted herself and was therefore too sensitive to talk about it rationally. High-ranking members lined up to defend the person that said that and the issue was dropped. We also had gender parity rules for delegates at the convention that were not followed and nobody cared. Which leads me to a third point:\n\n* They don't have principles outside of being multi-tendency. They refuse to take clear stands on a lot of issues because that would alienate some of the more liberal blocs and they would lose members. The few rules they did have were routinely disregarded.\n\n* The organization is almost all white people in their early 20s. No working class base, very few people of color (at a national convention with over a hundred people I could count PoCs on one hand).\n\n* They are very anti-communist and very, VERY paranoid about an imagined communist plot to infiltrate their ranks. I seriously got lectured about it twice at a convention one time. They have passed resolutions to denounce Marxism-Leninism, so be aware that while multi-tendency does extend to pro-imperialist war hawks and Obama Birthers, it does not extend to Leninists or god forbid Maoists.\n\n* The national party is run by the NY and NJ locals. Thankfully the NJ local has some good people in it, but because of the way NC meetings occur, if you're not in NJ or NY, your local will be very under-represented. This leads to drama like you wouldn't believe -- Detroit hates and mistrusts the Florida local, the Florida local thinks NJ is plotting against them, etc.\n\n* Which leads to another point: democratic it ain't. Blocs form and try to push other blocs around. And at the conventions, delegates make up their minds about issues on the spot-- It was always shocking to me how my local would discuss the convention packets with proposed amendments, organizing questions, etc, for weeks ahead of time and come to a consensus decision, and then get to the convention and none of the other delegates have discussed anything with their locals at all and had no idea what issues we would even be talking about. This, I think, comes in large part from the fact that their members are completely inexperienced in organizing anything outside of street corner protests twice a year and maybe a couple of concerts to get donations.\n\nAll that said, my local was awesome and the first time I met with the national org I was shocked by the disconnect. So if your local has good organizers doing good work, you can avoid the unpleasantries of the the national for the most part. But then you have to ask yourself if you want the national to represent you, and if you want to give time, money, and other resources to a moribund liberal social club. I couldn't do it anymore and my honest opinion is that if you are a communist, you will also tire of it.\n\nHere's my disclaimer: I quit and lots of things could have changed since I left. But given what I hear from people still in, and given that the SP hasn't changed much in general since the 70s, I doubt it. ","created_utc":1529284848,"score":15,"subreddit":"communism"}

If I remember correctly, this was after Pakistan signed a treaty with the US establishing 'intelligence bases' on the northern border to Central Asia, and after the Afghan President executed the 'preferred candidate' of the Communist Party, who was advocating a multi-party coalition government. In the first month of the occupation, the Soviet Foreign Minister agreed to the offer by the US Secretary of State of a 'mutual non-basing agreement' in Iran and Pakistan, in exchange for a total Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the National Security Adviser convinced the US President to withdraw from further talks and an early settlement, and it took years of fighting to establish a UN peace process.\n\nTo compare, the US intervened throughout Central and South America to impose foreign privatization of major industry and a mono-export model for each country.

If they took such a risk, and if the consequence was a global expansion of their foreign trade, a wholesale lifting of the 'technological embargo' of the West, and a re-centralization and accompanying democratization over their planning process, the economy could probably have had the opposite of a diminishing rate of GNP.

That being said, I'm somewhat familiar with some past and current work within the field regarding economic planning.  \n\nLets start with the past\n\nSoviet78, someone I follow on the forum [Soviet-Empire.com](http:\/\/www.soviet-empire.com\/ussr\/index.php?sid=60e1f8eb3e4dbc2a06f4fa82d7ca9026) posted on this subject a while back: [Cyberneticists' Plans for Technocratic Economic Management](http:\/\/www.soviet-empire.com\/ussr\/viewtopic.php?f=128&amp;t=48509). Here's a link to the [article he discusses](http:\/\/web.mit.edu\/slava\/homepage\/articles\/Gerovitch-InterNyet.pdf). It's a good read I suggest you check it out.\n\nFor those without the slightest idea what I'm talking about, here's a page on [Viktor Mikhailovich Glushkov and A.I. Kitov's work](http:\/\/uacomputing.com\/stories\/ogas\/)\n\nHere are a few YouTube videos on the topic:\n\n[The invention of the internet in the Soviet Union](https:\/\/youtu.be\/72SVeO_xmxg)\n\n[Victor Glushkov's idea of a Soviet computer network](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Wu0dOid3t-o)\n\n[Victor Glushkov - pioneer of Soviet computing](https:\/\/youtu.be\/lMS1hBhV2-4)\n\nThis one has less to do with OGAS but is kinda cool in that it talks about the Soviet economy: [Soviet planned economy and the absence of crises](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ScU6W3rUEsI)\n\nI believe economists in the former GDR were working on something as well but the only link I have is in German [Systematische Heuristik](https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Systematische_Heuristik)\n\nI'd also check out Stafford Beer and Project Cybersen.\n\nNow for current research on planning I strongly suggest you look into the work being done by cyberneticist and economist Dr. Paul Cockshott of the University of Glasgow. I suggest checking out his new YouTube channel and watching ALL of his videos as there are only a few. On the topic of cybernetics and communism you'll probably want to start with [this one](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cI01-5zhwdA). \n\nHere he is giving a lecture at the Left Forum on [cybernetic planned economics](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LtlZys7QOO4&amp;t=1176s)\n\nHis book Towards A New Socialism is brilliant.

What you should've said was \"How *has,*\" not \"how would.\" But thats okay, English isn't everyone's first language, I understand. Anyway, if you want resources on how communism has helped the third world, look at what happened in previously socialist nations like Burkina Faso, or even the USSR, which I suppose prior to socialism could be considered to be a 3rd world country. Or, if you'd prefer, there's more modern examples, like looking at the improvements to education and healthcare in Cuba or under the Zapatistas ([https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rebel\\_Zapatista\\_Autonomous\\_Municipalities](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rebel_Zapatista_Autonomous_Municipalities)). There's way more examples, but I suppose the biggest point is that socialism in the third world tends to bring healthcare, education, as well as equality, environmentalism, and in many cases, industrialisation. Pretty much an all round improvement in the quality of life.\n\n&gt; why does the government decide if I get my medicine of not \n\nI know, its pretty tragic that the bourgeois government in many nations has sold out to privatisation and allowed drug companies to decide whether or not you get your medication, based on your income.

{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Oh man, here we go. \n\n1) Class - class was very different from an American university. Every class-year of students kind of stays together in a cohort throughout their 5 years at university in their \u201cespecializaci\u00f3n\u201d - like a major, but even a bit more specific. Most courses met twice a week for around 2 hours. Usually they were incredibly lecture based, sometimes less engaging than American lecture halls even though most classes had less than 40 students. Every third week of class was \u201cseminario,\u201d similar to a discussion section in the US. To put it technically, seminarios were fucking lit. At first they were really intimidating as a non-native speaker because everyone shouts over each other, including the professors. What I really came to appreciate about the seminarios was how passionate, informed, diplomatic, and well-reasoned my peers were. No one says a goddamn word in discussion in the US. \n\n2) Ideology - Oh yeah, they don\u2019t hide that it\u2019s socialist. ML theory is mandatory as well as national defense (foreigners couldn\u2019t take national defense!). Retrospectively, I wish I took ML, but the professor was boring. I can\u2019t give you numbers, but of course the professors are overwhelmingly communist and socialist. You\u2019d converse with an academic every now and then who you could see felt the pull of US hegemony, but even people who aren\u2019t socialist in Cuba usually aren\u2019t capitalists, either. \n\n3) Capitalism\/liberalism vs. Socialism - My favorite course was Political Economy of Socialism. The first few weeks taught capitalist theory objectively and without criticism. Really not too different from run of the mill Econ 101. It\u2019s not like they are ignorant of the theories. They\u2019ve just learned about it and realized that It Is Bad. We then spent a week tearing all of that down, and transitioned into socialization of markets and more ML theory than I was expecting. The professor was super dynamic, proudly socialist, and probably the most accepting and open-minded educator I\u2019ve ever encountered. \n\nThe history course I took covered ~1840 to around 1910. Honestly, I found the class really objective and taught not all that differently from my history courses at my American university. My history department had a lot of New Left historians who were pretty woke about American imperialism and telling honest stories about historically heroic but flawed actors, and my Cuban history professor had a similar approach. One notable thing, however, was that this was the first upper level history course my Cuban peers had taken before. They had been fed lots of stuff about their national heroes before university, and one day the professor gave a bio without 100% good things to say on Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes, who was a leader in the first war against Spain. One student from the back yelled, *\u201d\u00a1mentira!\u201d* The professor laughed and said alright that\u2019s it we\u2019re going to the archives. So he brought us to the library and showed us the letters he was using as sources, super neat - great educator. When we were out one night that weekend all of my Cuban friends from class were talking about how shocking it was to learn new info about someone they believed to be a perfect founder of their nation,  and that it felt good they were being taught honestly. \n\nLiterature - taught like any English course would be here. \n\nI actually did an AMA on old account when I got back, but I wouldn\u2019t have called myself a Leftist at that time so it would be a lot of fun to revisit it through a new lens.

{"author":"comradeconvict","body":"&gt;\"communism doesn't work\"\n\nFirst of all it's important to distinguish between socialism and communism. There has never been any communist countries, and by that i don't mean the \"no real communism\" argument, but communism is the system that arises from socialism; a stateless society where everyone works according to their ability, and recieves according to their needs. In \"The State and Revolution\", Lenin says that communism may never be realized, but that it's what we believe will emerge from socialsm, however, it may or may not. Socialism is a system in which the workers control the means of production, and where people work according to their ability, and recieves according to their work. The former has never occured, but the latter has (Soviet Union, Maoist China, Vietnam etc.)\n\nSecondly, make them define what that means. What is central to an economic system working? After the Russian Civil War, life expactancy in Russia rose dramaticly (I.e under socialist rule), is that not a sign of it working? During the first five year plan life expectancy fell, but after the Soviet Union had industrialized, life expectancy sharply rose again.*\n\nSecondly they beat the nazis, which none of the capitalist european nations managed to do. Additionally, many historians argue that the Soviet Union wouldn't have been able to beat the nazis without the rapid industrialization that occured under Stalin.\n\n&gt;\"people are greedy, so communism won't work\"\n\nPeople are greedy, so capitalism doesn't work. Everyone is trying to maximise their own capital, which leads to companies depressing wages, firing people, which destroys consumers buying power, eventually destroying businesses; and then finally creates crisis which only occur under capitalism. The Great Depression is probably the best example of this, though there are many others.\n\nThe reason the Soviet Union collapsed was due to the horrible mismanagement of the soviet economy by the post-Stalin leaders, especially Kruschev (at least in my opinion). Kruschevs \"virgin lands\" project, as well as his other failed farming reforms (especially the disbanding of the Machine-Tractor Stations) left a lasting strain on the soviet economy.[1] \n\n&gt;\"communism is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions of people\"\n\n[So is capitalism.] (http:\/\/i0.kym-cdn.com\/photos\/images\/original\/001\/318\/348\/f5f.jpg) If you are going to atribute the deaths of the famines that occured under socialist rule to socialism, you should do the same with capitalist countries.\n\nAlso the alleged deaths under socialist rule have been heavily inflated. Robert Conquest alleged that 20 million people were killed by Stalin, but we know today that the number is closer to 1-3 million (depending on what you account to Stalin). 1 million were executed, and then there is disagrement between historians on the last 2 million. Wheatcroft, Getty and Thustron are among the historians who agree on these estimates, though more do.[2]\n\n&gt;But these are the people who openly identify as leftists, but shop at waitrose and can afford to go to music concerts every week. They completely neglect the struggles of working people, but identify as on the left.\n\nPeople who call themselves leftist really just mean liberal. \n\nIf you need more help in the future i would be happy to respond on PM, but i won't have access to my books over the summer, so i might not be able to provide sources for my claims. If you want me to expand on anything, feel free to ask. \n\n*Life expectancy fell during the industrialization period due to famines, which has several factors; enviromental, the reliance on grain exports to aquire industrial equipment from the west and russias inneficient agriculture (which improved under Stalin). If you bring this up, your teachers will probably say that Stalin was responsible, but there is no evidence that confirms this, and it would be a soley faith-based assertion.\n\n[1] McCauley, M.

{"author":"DistantRight","body":"&gt; So should China halt completely or drastically diminish the goods coming to America? Essentially employing siege tactics to America.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit with China was $375 billion in 2017. The trade deficit exists because U.S. exports to China were only $130 billion while imports from China were $506 billion. So imagine that China stop or halt all exports to America completely. \n\nSo there's $506,000,000 billion in goods that are exported that can no longer be exported. One of two things needs to happen. Either A) other countries need to start buying China's $506 billion in goods or B) China needs to undergo major, major economic contraction. And one more thing, there is no option A. You can't find enough countries with an extra $500 billion in US dollars per year, or enough demand to buy China's goods with. Which means, Option B becomes reality. \n\nMillions of manufacturing jobs in China go kaput. China's explosive GDP contracts faster than a fat mans penis in a glacial lake. Worse still, the US still has the nuclear economic option. China has purchased a significant amount of US treasuries with the surplus value taken from their workers. The US pays out the treasuries on a regular schedule. The treasury could use the nuclear option and revoke all those treasuries from existence. This would help offset the governments spending when the US GDP crashes.\n\nNow, this isn't to say the US is not hurting and that the nuclear economic option wouldn't be horrible for the US as well. Just that the US has more options to cope in the long term. The US has mostly switched to a services economy rather than an industrial production economy. Still, all those cheap goods that US purchases from China, can be produced for a few pennies more in other countries. In places like India who would love nothing more than to gain the kind of economic growth even half of $506 billion can bring. Countries would be lining up on the US doorstep to build factories in other slightly more expensive, but still lower than US manufacturing costs. Capitalism doesn't give shit which country gets exploited and it will quickly move to other countries to produce goods and exploit their slightly more expensive labor.\n\nThe US would go into depression as well, likely pulling down the entire globe into a global financial depression. The cost of goods would skyrocket tremendously in the USA. Economic GDP would fall as a result. Millions of jobs would be lost stateside, while the capitalist markets determines if they're enough liquidity by consumers to produce goods stateside or move them to Vietnam, India, etc.\n\nGlobally, trade falls dramatically while other nations deal with a global crisis. Countries who had access to global financial markets for investment, find there is no more investment to be had. Countries barely out of poverty slip back into poverty. Lives will be lost as a result.\n\nAnd that's just the economic effects at a minimum. Then there's the diplomatic (it would get worse).\n\nSo to answer your question, 'So should China halt completely or drastically diminish the goods coming to America?' You tell me...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","created_utc":1529550680,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

Before I got married, my previous partner for nearly five years was not a socialist.

{"author":"corvibae","body":"Most of the major socialist parties in the country have active youth wings, I'm a CPUSA member, and while I'm not involved in the Young Communist League I was a Young Democratic Socialists of America local leader for about two years off and on. While our other comrade in this thread has called the CPUSA \"liberalized\" and I won't argue that there are liberals in the party, there are also liberals in every party. Manpower is low, and unless we want to be preaching to the choir sometimes liberals will get involved in an organization they really don't understand, but slowly come to socialism. Case in point, in the immediate aftermath of the 2016 election a good friend of mine at university joined DSA and became involved in our local YDSA chapter. I'm a pretty firm Marxist-Leninist, he described his action as \"joining the first non-Democratic Party organization with the word Democratic in the name\" and over time, he realized that he was a socialist who advocated for a lot more than he originally did. He recognized his own liberalism, engaged in self criticism, and eventually outgrew DSA as an organization painfully controlled by liberals. He's now a member of the Socialist Party USA and is doing fantastic organizing work in Houston. \n\nSo, here's my rough suggestion: check out who is near you and reach out. Find out what kind of work the folks are doing and what kind of people they are. If you're asked to do anything your uncomfortable doing and pressured to do it after letting people know, it probably isn't the organization for you. Are people sullen and angry? Are they positive and optimistic? Is the work good or lackluster? Good luck comrade. ","created_utc":1529781907,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

They don't work the same way as a SEZ, as the DPRK's goal is to attract investment mainly in three fields: IT, agriculture and tourism. Inside these SDPs, it isn't exactly a free market, because wages are defined by the DPRK's government, and corporate income taxes range from 10% to 14%.

There\u2019s a book out there called CIA-Sendero Luminoso but I can\u2019t find an English translation or any detailed background on the author.  There\u2019s also the facts of geopolitical context- the Shining Path\u2019s major campaigns kicked into high gear in the 80s during the first Alan Garc\u00eda administration.  Garcia from what I can tell seemed back then to be an Allende type figure who tried to nationalize industry and defy the IMF.  Shining Paths attacks helped destabilize his administration and led to the rise of Fujimori.  They also spent a suspicious amount of time attacking other leftists like Tupac Amaru. IMO it\u2019s also suspicious that their supposed mass support collapsed relatively quickly, compare to the NPA, Naxalites, and others whose mass base has enabled them to sustain a people\u2019s war for decades despite enormous adversity and setbacks.  All in all no definitive proof but what I know of their history certainly raises questions.\n\nI've never heard anything at all to that effect about the Naxalites though, so CPI (Marxist) would have definitely been in the wrong for suppressing them.

Like the main criticisms that communism doesn't work because there supposedly are no incentives to work, how does value of labor is determined (since some things are harder to do than others)? How communism ensures that 'according to the needs' is not abused? How would property, like housing work under communism? How would planned economy ensure that demand is coincides with production? A lot of communist commenters seem to talk mostly about social issues fixed by communism. But it seems hard to find communist literature that would explain the details of communist economy and is not just criticism of capitalist shortcomings.

Each time my computer decided I was tapping back key -\\_- ...\n\nAnyway, while I know I can't debate communistic ideals here (that's why I will not comment on the latter four points), The Israeli points do not appear to be connect to the topic (Which is also why I wonder why is this post in this particular subreddit):\n\n1. In general it is illegal to shoot and\/or kill, protesters or reporters. Usually, if they result to using their guns, soldiers will use rubber bullets as well. You can also see this in the Elior Azarioa case, or similar ones like it - where soldiers did murder terrorists (not even protesters) despite the terrorist being neutralized. These soldiers were convicted for murder. Furthermore, prior to use of lethal force, non lethal and non violent actions are usually taken - again, by law. You should read the firearm protocol in Israel for more information (I am translating from Hebrew so it might have a different name, \u05e0\u05d5\u05d4\u05dc \u05e4\u05ea\u05d9\u05d7\u05d4 \u05d1\u05d0\u05e9). Soldiers must abide by it and soldiers are really afraid from it.\n\nSecondly, I assume you refer to the events of weeks past. I would hardly call them \"protests\", as they were throwing rocks, flaming bottles, flew burning kites emblazoned with swastikas ( These burned Israeli farms causing damages estimated in millions ), and tried to sabotage the border fence. My question to you is what would the United States, Germany, or any other country would do when someone acts like their on  their borders ?\n\n2 + 3. As someone who lived in Israel for many years, I have no idea where you took this from. Arabic people have strong political representation, including their own parties in the Knesset (the Israeli parliament) \\[which is quite ironic seeing as many of those parties don't acknowledge Israel and meet with convicted terrorists\\] . While like every nation political agendas vary, and extremest exist- never have I seen or met anything even remotely similar to this. In some cities (such as Tel Aviv), the predominant ideology is left winged - With demonstrations \\*for\\* peace and a two state\/combined state solution, not against peace.\n\n4. The Gaza strip receives almost all its electricity from Israel, which also contributes water and cement annually to the region. Moreover,  in 2005 (to my recollection), when Israel resigned control over the water in the region to the Palestinian National Authority (including 25 water wells), over 3000 illegal wells were built which greatly destroyed the water quality in the area (the main water problem is that most of the water is undrinkable).\n\nBTW, the water situation in Israel isn't grate either (though thanks to better management it's not as dire). There is a long running drought in the region for decades now. Water is exorbitantly expensive in Israel as a result.","created_utc":1530044686,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

A country which is ruled by a party belonging to the Socialist International (so, same group as Labour and SPD), that hasn't really socialised the economy, but that is singled out as the target daily. Some years ago when it was obvious that Chavez had put an end to US-led intervention (which included mass killings), when Chavez was \"hip\", those \"left wing with a human face\" groups had their mouth full with Chavez... but if there is something this groups can't live with is the burden of maintaining a principled anti-imperialist position when it starts to be inconvenient, when the propaganda levels reach such a dimension that their media presence (and they are generally very well covered by bourgeois media, to an extent that can be surprising to some) would suffer from it.., then they, to whom the only good revolution is the one in which workers are slaughtered and leaders assassinated since it allows them to maintain their \"solidarity\" when there is nothing at stake, start to denounce it, \"We were with them in the beginning, but now... there are human rights! There are democratic doubts! We can't support that!\".\n\nWhy do I say this here? Because they would have said **the exact same for Chile**, the same Chile they now talk about and like to show solidarity with. And they would have done it because **the media coverage was almost exactly the same**, and the representatives of said movements at the time **made the exact same \"we can no longer close our eyes to Allende's bypassing of democratic process\" play**\n\n\nTake a look at the [New York Times Reactions to the  Election of Salvador Allende](http:\/\/www.janus.umd.edu\/Feb2002\/allendewill\/01.html) and watch how the only thing that changed was the technology (which amplifies all of this)\n\n\n&gt;Three days later, a September 9 New York Times editorial, titled \"Severe Tests for Chile,\" **cast another dreary picture of that country's future under Allende, warning that the country likely faced \"constitutional crisis or even civil war.**\"11 Unlike the two previous editorials, \"Severe Tests for Chile\" goes beyond lamenting the inevitably fatal consequences of a socialist infection in Chile, to speculating on possible preventitive remedies.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sulzberger, echoing a common perspective among Allende's critics, **saw Allende as a dictator in democratic disguise \"who may well lie low, stress his moderation, and international respectability,\" but whose government \"could well be tempted to employ totalitarian methods to achieve its aims.\"** \n&gt;\n&gt;In addition to an editorial stance that treated Allende's election as a catastrophe, the Times's ostensibly more objective news articles, **through their emphases, tone, omissions, and selection of sources, betrayed a perspective hostile to Allende.** The sense of alarm within the editorials is also conveyed, albeit more subtly, in New York Times articles through, for example, the choice to introduce Allende to the reader as \"a Marxist who says he would like to see Chile follow the road of revolutionary Cuba.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;In addition to presenting Allende as the next Castro, **New York Times reports focused their perspective on Allende's opposition, and for the most part neglected to inform the reader that many Chileans were enthusiastic about his election.** Out of twenty-eight articles, seventeen relied heavily on either U.S. governmental sources or upper-class Chileans opposed to Allende, while only two focused on Allende's supporters. Despite the fact that massive celebrations followed Allende's election, the New York Times never mentioned such festive reactions among Allende's working and middle-class supporters. **Rather, we learn from Joseph Novistski that the members of the Prince of Wales Country Club in Las Condes had adopted a \"wait and see\" approach and that \"young rugby players greeted each other jokingly as Comrade**\n&gt;\n&gt;**Several articles report massive bank withdrawals, rising black market exchange rates, and booked flights out of the country in the weeks following the election**\n&gt;\n&gt;**The Times also presented UP fears of U.S. hostility as irrational.** After a right-wing group shot General Ren\u00e9 Schnieder Chereau, the Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army, the New York Times reported that the left-wing Chilean press had been accusing the CIA of plotting against Allende and of masterminding the Schneider assassination. (...) **Future declassified documents would reveal that the U.S. had been anything but aloof during the election, and that Aniceto Rodriguez was entirely accurate in his accusations**. The CIA spent between $800,000 and $1,000,000 during the 1970 Chilean presidential campaign trying to prevent an Allende victory and helped the International Telephone and Telegraph Company (ITT) and other U.S. businesses channel over $700,000 to the Alessandri campaign.36 After Allende won the election the CIA adopted a \"firm and continuing policy that Allende be overthrown by a coup.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;Unfortunately, **the cooperation of journalists such as Szulc was part of that manipulation. According to a CIA report, in an effort to create hostile international opinion toward Allende, by the end of September the CIA had \"15 journalist agents from 10 different countries\" and \"8 more journalists from countries under the direction of high-level agents\" in Chile \"for on-the-scene reporting.\"45 The CIA boasted that the success of this campaign was apparent from the fact that in the European and Latin American media \"only partial returns show 726 articles, broadcasts, editorials, and similar items as a direct result of agency activity,\" and that the \"multiplier effect\" of such items must have been \"substantial and significant.**\n&gt;\n&gt;At a time when the U.S. Government was intentionally trying to manipulate press coverage of an event, and in a region in which that government had a long history of both overt and covert intervention, **Sulzberger and his peers dutifully, unhesitatingly, and unquestioningly repeated that which their government fed them as fact.**\n\n\nAllende: a would-be dictator with a country nearing civil war, with \"human rights\" being abused, the cause of his own death by those who wished to \"pacify\" society and bring it back to \"a democratic track\", his supporters lunatics that imagined US interventions that didn't exist while bringing the country to bankruptcy and daily inflation. That all of this was demonstrated to be the direct result of criminal US intervention **by the CIA own declassified files in the 70s** means little since declassification only happens because they know that it doesn't matter, all of what was done is kept alive through ideology in a farcical show of selective amnesia.","created_utc":1530098556,"score":14,"subreddit":"communism"}

As a fellow millenial an ocean and a continent away from you, from a country with a HUGE communist history and probably the most popular and influential ML Party in Europe I can't honestly say that your problems aren't also extremely prominent here and that I don't share your experiences. I know what it feels like to organize a meeting and invite people, only for the same faces to show up again and again. I know what it feels like to try to talk so many goddamn people into your cause, only to find out that they are completely unwilling to do almost anything. I know what it feels to give your all and still fail. There are a lot of times that I feel exhausted too, mentally, emotionally and physically. That I am nothing more than a modern Sysyphus, rolling that boulder up that hill over and over, until the day I die. \nI've thought about givin' up too. The prospect doesn't sound that bad, right? More free time to do the things we like, less stress and anxiety, no fear of being beaten up (or worse) by a cop or a bunch nazis.\nBut we can't do that, comrade. You know why? Because what we do isn't a hobby. We don't go \"15:00 to 17:00 I've got pilates and then 18:00 to 21:00 I'm a communist\". We are communists when we wake up, when we go to work, when we strike, when we talk to people, when we go to the bar, when we read a book. It's a part of our identity, of who we are.\nOur work, even if it seems fruitless today, serves many purposes. It makes us more experienced, more capable. But, also, more importantly, It plants a seed. A seed that may take years to grow but, nonetheless, will eventually grow. Have no doubt about it. Even if we don't see a revolution in our lifetimes (which seems very unlikely), the one our children will bring upon will come from the seed we planted. \nI hope I didn't come of as preachy. These are thoughts I've had many many sleepless nights, wondering if I really matter in the grand scheme of things. But I think of all the people that inspire me. My grandfather, for example, fought the nazis and then spent 7 years in prison getting tortured for being a communist. He and many others were offered to sign a paper denying their ideology in exchange for their freedom. Most of them, including my grandpa, refused. There are countless stories like these and I know that these people weren't special, or superheroes.

Of course, the original communist party in Brazil was the PCB (Partido Comunista Brasileiro), that fought some important moments in brazilian history, being legalized and thrown into illegality some times, and was the party involved with the Third Internationale and had Olga Benario as one of it's biggest members. After the XX Congress, as in many places around the world, the party followed the khrushchevite tendency, and other members (following the CPC) broke apart and created the PCdoB (Partido Comunista do Brasil). But the \"maoist\" tendency didn't last long and now PCB and PCdoB are still the biggest communist parties in Brazil, but both follow a \"electoral\" line, and the rhetoric of class struggle and of violent revolution is long gone. \n\nBut, there were (and still are) other minor movements, specially in the rural areas, movements of occupation of empty buildings, many movements of women, etc. I personally don't know many movies and documentaries about these things (I don't believe studios want to give money to people to make movies about communism), specially with english subtitles, but there is a huge variety of books and authors that are worth reading.

The image of the MST in urban areas is not positive, as it is associated (1) with PT (that was made a scarecrow \\[or scapegoat, I don't know how you would call it\\] by the right since the rise of Lula in the 80's and remains until today) and (2) the media (that is a crucial thing in Brazil, comparable I believe with the US) also paints them as \"violent invaders of land\" and scum. The people do not necessarily associate the MST with socialism, as it is something blurry (the right accuses it of being socialist, and some on the left even say that PT is socialist, so it is pretty messy), but the dominant ideology makes many people believe that if the MST is taking latifundio land then they are thieves and may steal their own \"property\" (even if they have none, but of course, that's something on the superstructure). In the rural areas I can't tell, as I never went to the places where they be. I don't really have and opinion on the MST, as I said, I haven't studied their history and their current actions, but I don't dismiss them in any way, as they are the biggest movement in the rural areas.\n\nBom, eu nunca estudei o MST, sua hist\u00f3ria e tudo mais, mas pelo que eu sei, por mais que possa haver alguns l\u00edderes no movimento que advoguem pelo socialismo, eles nunca tornaram p\u00fablica tal postura (pelo menos nos anos mais recentes, incluindo junto ao PT \\[partido do Lula e da Dilma\\], o partido com quem eles se aliaram recentemente).

{"author":"CamaradaBolivari","body":"Relax, it's important to practice whenever you can, to me it was a surprise actually because your portuguese is really good! \n\nWell, that is a truly difficult question. Some groups on the left here are focusing on the Lula Livre movement (because, even not being a marxist, he is a political prisoner), and they don't have a strong leadership as Lula to run for the elections, the closest they have is Boulos, from PSOL. Boulos is a man involved with the MTST (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Sem Teto), and is a strong supporter of Lula. He'll run for president for PSOL, a party that was formed from a faction of PT, but nonetheless they are close allies. Still, he (nor PSOL as a party) doesn't have a big image like Lula (most people began noticing him in recent years, and some still don't know him), so there's a chance that, if Lula isn't freed in time, the left (or progressive, if you don't wanna call them leftists) will not elect the next president. But there's a problem with all the election process and those left groups, and is a problem that is present in most countries but unfortunately isn't addressed by the communist parties. Most people in Brazil **DO NOT** believe anymore in elections. This year, the CNT (Confedera\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do Transporte) published a research asking 2.002 people from all over Brazil what they felt about the elections, the candidates, and their overall trust in the institutions in the country. The most reliable institution was the church (40,1&amp;#37;), followed by the Army (16,2&amp;#37;), the Justice (8,6&amp;#37;), Press (5&amp;#37;), Police (4&amp;#37;), Federal Government (2,2&amp;#37;), National Congress (0,6&amp;#37;) and political parties (0,2&amp;#37;). From the intention of vote for the election on the first round, Lula is the top one with only 18,6&amp;#37; (of course, in researches made by other institutions, the press etc., the numbers may vary with different criteria, but Lula is always in the top), Null votes 21,4&amp;#37; and those who haven't decided yet are 39,6&amp;#37;. What this shows us is that the masses in Brazil (and not just Brazil, but I believe in the US shouldn't be too much different, as the rates of voting are really low) do not believe in the institutions, the elections, and all that. But, even with this \"disinterest\", the \"left\" parties (that follow an electoral line, like a said about PCB and PCdoB) do not denounce that, they remain with a rhetoric of faith in the elections, that if we \"vote right\" we can change things, so instead of taking the vanguard of the masses, they remain behind of the masses and try to bring them back, and unfortunately, most times it works.\n\n([http:\/\/www.cnt.org.br\/imprensa\/noticia\/resultados-136-pesquisa-cnt-mda](http:\/\/www.cnt.org.br\/imprensa\/noticia\/resultados-136-pesquisa-cnt-mda) the research, in portuguese) ","created_utc":1530159654,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

Deng studied Marxism in the Soviet Union and was in the communist party almost as long as Mao. If he was a mere nationalist, why join a the communist party in the 20s and stick with it even through the harshest times? Why not join the actual nationalist party?\n\nThe reasoning for Deng's reforms is totally different than that of Khrushchev and Gorbachev. The Soviet leaders underwent reform as an end unto itself. They sought to decentralize the economy after it was heavily centralized. The opposite is true with Deng. He saw a market as a means to an end, but understood fully dangers it would bring, thus a market must eventually be abolished. He also did this to centralize a heavily decentralized system. \n\nI also don't see how people compare it to menshevism either. The Mensheviks wanted to withhold a revolution completely until the capitalists fully developed everything. China underwent a revolution so the menshevik comparison can't be made from the start. Deng wanted to maintain a dictatorship of the proletariat over the capitalist class, something which the mensheviks also rejected because of their rejection of revolution.","created_utc":1530172814,"score":16,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"predalienmack","body":"Fascism arises from the periodic crises inherent to the capitalist system. Fascism utilizes nationalism, militarism, ethnocentrism, sexism, homophobia, etc. to strengthen the capitalist class under the guise of strengthening the \u201cnation\u201d or the \u201cpeople.\u201d Fascists are married to the policy of using the State to maintain power (as all capitalists ultimately are). \n\nCommunists may use the State to enact changes, but their goals are to systemically undermine the hold of the capitalist system and to ultimately render capitalism and the State obsolete as a dominant form of societal production, distribution, and organization. Communists are against nationalism, militarism, sexism, racism, etc., and see those forms of discrimination and division as tools of the capitalist class to keep the working class divided and ineffective at exercising political power. Nationalism and militarism have been used by socialist countries as a means for survival and creating unity, but not to anywhere near the same degree or maliciousness as the imperialist superpowers that have been the face of capitalism for centuries. \n\nNow, any place where communists seize power does not exist in a vacuum. The State and its structures exist and are entrenched in society and the way people think about how society should and can function, and it will continue to exist as long as class divisions still exist. Capitalism also dominates our worldview because it is the dominant system everywhere in the world (outside of a couple of places, and even that is debatable). This means that communists with any realistic perspective on how to change society and defeat capitalism acknowledge that the State and capitalism can not be deconstructed\/replaced overnight, and that people within one nation or around the world have to be gradually socialized into having the necessary mindset and skills to function without those two systems in place. This is a multigenerational process (if any previous attempts at socialism\/communism are to be looked to as an example of this transition process). \n\nThis also means that attempts to build a socialist society and keep it from being overthrown or sabotaged by capitalists is a difficult process with a lot of variables that are hard to account for, meaning sometimes mistakes happen and countries that try to build socialism end up doing shitty things that we can look back on in retrospect and criticize (rightfully so). That does not make communists like fascists, however. The reasons for actions do matter, and fascists and communists act for completely different reasons. Fascists are also big fans of genocide and capitalism, which are differences so major when compared to communists that it is impossible to reasonably equivocate the two ideological tendencies. \n\nHistory has proven places dominated by fascism and socialism to be markedly different as well. As flawed as the DPRK may be, the DPRK has never orchestrated a genocide within its own borders, or made an attempt to create an empire. The DPRK has been suffering from economic imperialism and the threat of invasion for the duration of its existence, and yet it has done remarkably well with the limited resources it has access to at actually advancing their society and people in a way that is reflective of the desires and values of the Korean people. It may not be perfect, but it is profoundly different than Nazi Germany or fascist Italy on far more levels than just on the surface. ","created_utc":1530230716,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

TIK did a [video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JnWNnI6YlQQ) on this, i suggest you watch it he fleshes it out (keep in mind that he is a liberal and he still clings to the whole \"stalin was evil\" thing so don't get caught up with that just focus on the army thing). \n\n&gt;\"Russia did win the 2nd World War in spite of having Stalin as leader.\" She also likes to compare Hitler and Stalin, demonizes the DPRK and thinks that Churchill is a hero. \n\nyeah, most liberals no nothing about stalin's actually battle orders and ideas, so its easy for them to say stalin was a horrible leader, when in reality if stalin wasn't there the USSR would probably be crushed by the nazis. firstly stalin was dedicated to the war, he wasn't some  lazy guy just doing nothing, for instance there were over 200 front line officers and stalin knew everyone by name, face, and where they were on the battle field (refer to the book i already linked). stalin also endangered his own life many times through out the war, like when the nazis came within sight of moscow and all of the other officials left, stalin stayed  in moscow. on top of this stalin also made good calls when it came to the army, like his famous order \"no step back\" in which retreating would be seen as traitorous and you would be shot. a lot of liberals like to cry about this order because it was so \"mean\", but in reality even red army soldiers thought it was a good call and should have been in place sooner. i mean there literally was no where to step back, any steps back would mean the nazis got moscow or stalingrad. the red army really took heavy loses due to their men retreating without orders and in turn many civilian villages got over run by the nazis and their population brutalized. this order could be credited for the red army's turn around in late 42 and early 43. then you just have to think about it logically, if the liberals claim stalin controlled everything and he was the only one who made the choices, then if he was a poor leader how did the USSR win the war. \n\nwestern history of WWII is primarily constructed by the nazis officers we brought back to the US during project paper clip, we basically trusted them to tell the truth about the soviets, well guess what, they didn't. so you have all of these crazy stories about stalin being a poor war leader, or the red army being bad at war, and all of that garbage but in the end the USSR won. that should tell you all you need to know about these liberal sources. check out that book that book is gold it covers everything about stalin, read it ten times through then memorize it. also check out that other link for a more thorough look at the purges, and you could also check out TIK he has some good videos on the USSR during the War but just remember its from a liberal point of view. \n\nEDIT: ALSO. Churchill was a little capitalist parasite. he held the british idea that famine was not caused by economic relations but by the starving people themselves. Churchill once said in a war meeting that it was the Indian's fault there was a famine in Bengal because they kept \"breeding like rabbits\". this same kind of attitude was  held by many well to do people in british society during the irish potato famine.

But I really don't know about this, as if she ever gave any sort of somewhat public speech about being anti-capitalist, I feel like the media would run away with it. But I mean, I'm not an all seeing god, so I easily could just be wrong, and she could easily be smart enough to know when and where to say certain things. That said, I also think she would at least MENTION a democratic workplace, a la worker coops (I know, I know, calm down). But from my passive understand, she has not. But again, I could easily be wrong. \n\nObvious comparisons can be made to Bernie Sanders. Who, I feel like many of us helped bring us more towards Marx\/Lenin\/Mao\/communism. But I do have some valid criticisms against the man, no matter how much I do admire and thank him for bringing the \"S-word\" back into US politics. Some of these criticisms are voting for the invasion of Yugoslavia, and just (used very flippantly) calling for a raise in minimum wage, or Medicare for all. My opinion on this is extremely nuanced. And it should be EXTREMELY noted that Cortez is not Sanders, they are different people. So I digress. \n\nNow on to DSA. I am a member, and I have attended two different chapters. A main city one, and a much more local one. While both had their Marxists-X or Anarchists or etc. There were many Social Democrats. I, again, have read that she is more than just a Social Democrat, but that's from comments on reddit with 0 source or backing. So I honestly have no idea her true political alignment. And I guess that goes with Sanders. \n\nTo branch off this, I don't know how many of you have read the comments on the various liberal subreddits, but they seriously STILL have no idea what socialism means. It can be by bots or just ignorant people, but I have seen (again, personal experience) SEVERAL HEAVILY upvoted comments saying that socialism still is when the government does stuff, and not something like economic democracy or being critical of the capitalist system or anything even close to that vein. \n\nAll that said... I am excited. It seems like she'll win the election and be voted into Congress.

And also, hopefully, she'll push more people to actually look into Marxist ideology like what happened to many us. There really is no telling. \n\nEDIT 2: PLEASE READ MY WHOLE COMMENT BEFORE TRYING TO TELL ME I'M WRONG. WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY IS ALMOST DEFINITELY CORRECT.

People in positions of power like this aren't hiding some great Marxist plan to overcome the imperial government and establish a worker's state. They are saying in plain english what they intend to do and that is the limit. Imagining anything more than what they say is fantasy, they are confined by the limits of American governance which at its best was a Keynesian welfare state (barely even that) but always an imperialist one.\n\nNever ever trust a Democrat, literally the graveyard where social movements go to die. On their last legs they are coopted by the Democratic party, neutered and turned into blithe platitudes to sate any revolutionary fervor that might be present.\n\nLenin said it best: \n\n&gt; But the danger of Kautskyism (Bernie-ism) lies in the fact that, utilising the ideology of the past, it endeavours to reconcile the proletariat with the \u201cbourgeois labour party\u201d, to preserve the unity of the proletariat with that party and thereby enhance the latter\u2019s prestige.\n\nThis too:\n\n&gt; Certain individuals among the present social-chauvinist leaders may return to the proletariat. But the social-chauvinist or (what is the same thing) opportunist trend can neither disappear nor \u201creturn\u201d to the revolutionary proletariat. Wherever Marxism is popular among the workers, this political trend, this \u201cbourgeois labour party\u201d, will swear by the name of Marx. It cannot be prohibited from doing this, just as a trading firm cannot be prohibited from using any particular label, sign or advertisement. It has always been the case in history that after the death of revolutionary leaders who were popular among the oppressed classes, their enemies have attempted to appropriate their names so as to deceive the oppressed classes.\n\nNever with the Democrats, the snakes! Fuck electoralism! The only way to build power is with the people in direct confrontation with those in power, not to sidle up to them and ask for concesssions in return. The biggest fear right now is to wake up in 30 years and realize we fucked up another Revolutionary Moment for a full generation chasing a seat at the the table with people who have never and will never want us there.\n\n\n\n\nAlso also: Here's Lenin remarking on the DSA from the past (the existence of the DSA is nothing new, DSA like parties and organizations have existed since time immemorial and have always been failures, quick to sell out the people)\n\n&gt;  No one can seriously think it possible to organise the majority of the proletariat under capitalism. Secondly\u2014and this is the main point\u2014it is not so much a question of the size of an organisation *(think of all the DSA members that bang on about how it's the biggest \"socialist\" organization in the US)*, as of the real, objective significance of its policy: does its policy represent the masses, does it serve them, i.e., does it aim at their liberation from capitalism, or does it represent the interests of the minority, the minority\u2019s reconciliation with capitalism?\n\n\n\n\nAll leftists should have an immediately adversarial relationship with anyone representing the US' government on any level, including people they once thought of as their allies. No one should have any quarter to damage the lives of the working class any further.

All these troubles are real but whats missing is the connections between these problems. One of the main jobs of the communist is to help demonstrate that society isn't facing 1000 problems, it's facing one problem with 1000 symptoms. The underground revolutionary newspapers in Russia were exactly that.\n\nThis dawning phase is where the Opportunist Reformists take root. They see the anger of the people at a system braking down, see these initial connections just begining to be formed, and then they jump on it by adopting that solution rhetoric to win elections. After enough data is collected by the people on just how bad the system is, but before the people fully realize that the issue is the innate construction of the system and not the collected policies of the system, the reformists have a window to claim they can fix the situation from the inside. \n\nOften their policies can be pretty good, it's just that their methods are doomed to fail because their ideology is inherently wrong (idealist and not dialectical materialism). I don't think Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is this evil person outright lying in her platform (and I really want to grab me a copy of her poster), but she's either going to have to majorly compromise her platform to get anything done or get completely marginalized, as that's what the Washington machine does. And even if she does somehow get a lot of her platform accomplished, you can't build a socialist system run by oligarchs and funded by an imperial war machine, the contradictions will all still be there and itll devolve into fascism again. \n\nWhat we need to watch out for is that these Reformist Opportunists can be very anti-communist. Theres a reason the DSA killed Rosa after all. The Reformist will often want to differentiate themselves from revolutionary communist groups in order to help ingratiate themselves into the system and prove that their platform isnt so radical that it can't be systemitized.

{"author":"corvibae","body":"I don't doubt that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is an amazing and passionate person who desires to do good for her community. I don't doubt that her supporters in the Bronx and Queens and across the country aren't amazing and passionate as well. One must remember, however, that DSA has had a congressperson before, and that individual's dues lapsed not long after he was elected, and the local chapter ended up endorsing his primary opponent this year. \n\nIt is understandably appealing to many in the United States, the idea of an underdog victory is naturally appealing. Elections are exciting, endorphine-creating things. They are meant to be that way on purpose. Unfortunately, Ocasio-Cortez's methods will fail, as will DSAs, and those like them, because as previous comrades have stated they are un-Marxist and un-dialectical. \n\nSocialism cannot be legislated. It cannot be brought about through liberal institutions because those institutions are wholly designed and function in the interests of capital, not in the interests of the working class. You cannot change these institutions from within, as we have seen, because the interests of capital will do whatever they can do in order to prevent that change. The Democratic Party machine, threatened by Bernie Sanders and his supporters, worked overtime in the last election to prevent his victory. They did this knowing that Sanders was their opportunity to defeat Donald Trump, and did so because Sanders, in a very small, minimal way threatened the interests of capital so slightly that they were moved to action.\n\nThe Democratic Party and the Republican Party may differ slightly on social issues, but both sides will say whatever they have to so they can get votes. Capitalists do not care, because they will succeed no matter who is in power. In exchange, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party have become the only truly viable paths to electoral victory in the United States. They will remain so, because the capitalists know this claim these organizations are \"private\" in order to keep out people who may want to challenge their chokehold on the working class of the world. \n\nOcasio-Cortez, like all those who desire to reform these corrupt institutions, will be given a choice: have the *opportunity* to do a little good and get rich doing it, or, be removed and replaced with a more compliant individual. Her victory is inspiring, and as other comrades have said it does show that class-consciousness is developing in her district, but it sadly does not portend the beginnings of victory for socialism in America. I wish it did. ","created_utc":1530337870,"score":11,"subreddit":"communism"}

For further reading I'd recommend Churchill's Secret War, By Madhusree Mukerjee\n\nHe actually stopped the Americans, Canadians and Australians from docking their ships to send famine relief in the 1943 famine. \n\n&gt;Churchill and his war cabinet, however, decided to reserve available shipping to take food to Italy in case it fell to the Allies. Indian nationalist Subhas Chandra Bose, then fighting with Axis forces, offered to send rice from Burma but British censors did not even allow his offer to be reported. **Australia and Canada were eager to send wheat but virtually all merchant ships plying in the Indian Ocean area had been moved to the Atlantic in order to bring food to Britain, which already had a comfortable stockpile.**\n\n&gt;**So hundreds of thousands perished in the villages of Bengal and, by the middle of 1943, hordes of starving people were flooding into Calcutta, most dying on the streets, often in front of well-stocked shops or restaurants serving lavish meals.** The very air of the metropolis, a journalist noted, was pervaded by that \"distinctive sourish odour which the victims give off a few hours before the end.\"\n\n&gt;In London, Churchill's beloved advisor, the physicist Frederick Alexander Lindemann (Lord Cherwell), was unmoved. **A firm believer in Malthusian population theory, he blamed Indian philoprogenitiveness for the famine \u2013 sending more food would worsen the situation by encouraging Indians to breed more. The prime minister was of the same opinion and expressed himself so colourfully that Leo Amery, Secretary of State for India, exploded at him, comparing his attitudes to Hitler's.**\n\n&gt;**The Churchill industry has always denied that their idol could have done anything to relieve the Bengal famine. Shipping, they claim, was scarce and it just wasn't possible to send food to Bengal. Mukerjee nails those \"terminological inexactitudes\" with precision. There was a shipping glut in summer and autumn 1943, thanks to the US transferring cargo ships to British control. Churchill, Lindemann and their close associates simply did not consider Indian lives worth saving.((\n\n&gt;Mukerjee has researched this forgotten holocaust with great care and forensic rigour. Mining an extensive range of sources, she not only sheds light on the imperial shenanigans around the famine, but on a host of related issues, such as the flowering of nationalism in famine-hit districts, Churchill's fury about the sterling credit that India was piling up in London, or the dreadful situation in the villages even after the famine was technically over. Her calmly phrased but searing account of imperial brutality will shame admirers of the Greatest Briton and horrify just about everybody else.\n\n \nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/communism\/comments\/8uu2zd\/officers_purged\/\n","created_utc":1530368290,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"caribeno","body":"The key lesson I have had reinforced  from SYRIZA and there are many lessons, is principally that if the party cannot control its leader in the capitalist government body then you will be betrayed at a key junction because people can be bought off and will look out for self first.  The Bolsheviks were also proven to have a party structure susceptible to even worse behavior.  There are very few high caliber benevolent  people with principles like Fidel Castro. Even if people disagree about my assessment of Castro the lesson still remains the same, you cannot let one man or even a committee lead a party if you do not have a mechanism to assure the leader will not betray your principles.  It is for this reason I think there must be inviolable principles written into the party FOUNDATIONAL DOCUMENT so that the party sellout can be revoked and kicked out of the party. Of course there must be some flexibility because circumstances and needs of  the party and people change.\n\nThis issue  is worthy of a thread and a volume of critical study unto itself. Here people are often arguing about having the \"correct socialist or communist line\" all the time as if they have discovered some vital secret, when in fact, it matters nothing if you have the correct socialist principles if you do not have organization which can preclude the betrayal and treachery in both capitalist government bodies and revolutionary political bodies and later on in socialist governing bodies. I don't know if we have to invent something new or if my idea of inviolable principles is sufficient, but there is much to say on this vital issue. If we, cannot get this issue right we might as well not even bother forming parties because as you have experienced, parties and people will only set themselves back and repeat the same mistakes over and over again.","created_utc":1530385449,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"internettext","body":"Sorry but China underwent a capitalist crisis cycle a few years back, all be it a small one, this was a gamble there was a \"proto-bourgeoisie\" that almost got out, there was no guaranty that there would be a XI to put it back in the box.  Market socialism is a road to capitalism, I don't see a reason for trying to rehabilitate Deng-theory, it wasn't just market mechanisms for resource allocation it produced wage-competition for workers, it also produced enormous ecological devastation, to produce a flood of consumerism, and billionaires, while the are some ameliorating mechanisms for example the high turnover rate for the super-wealthy and state-owned industrial base, but the overall society moved away from socialism. \n\nYou can say that it helped China in it's geopolitical struggle, but that makes it a specific measure for a specific time-frame in a specific place. This is almost certainly not reproducible in other countries, especially smaller ones that do not have a large industrial base and vast governmental capacity to domesticate transnational corporations.\n\n","created_utc":1530387894,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"HysniKapo","body":"The CPUSA, from the election of FDR onward, had problems with attaching itself too closely to the Democratic Party.\n\nThis reached its most extreme form in 1944-45 under Earl Browder, who argued that the Democrats and Republicans were not bourgeois parties but instead \"coalitions\" of divergent class interests, ergo there was no need for American workers to have their own party. He thus proposed that the CPUSA be dissolved in favor of a \"Communist Political Association\" that would operate within both parties. He argued that socialism was a very distant goal and that talking too much about it would only make it harder to work with liberals for the supposedly main task of carrying forward FDR's New Deal policies. He also argued that post-WWII US foreign policy would be beneficial to other countries. Foster's _[History of the Communist Party of the United States](http:\/\/b-ok.xyz\/book\/988561\/b4f382)_ discusses Browder's revisionism and is a good read in general.\n\nAnyway, partly due to the greater emphasis among pro-Soviet parties after 1956 of obtaining a peaceful\/parliamentary road to socialism, the CPUSA focused more and more on working with \"progressive\" Democrats. This got so bad that in 1988 the party stopped running its own candidates in elections, and made \"beating back the ultra-right\" (i.e. Republicans) contingent on endorsing Democrats for office no matter how bad their record, hence why they've endorsed every Democratic Presidential nominee since Dukakis.\n\nThey zealously tail the Democratic Party, deluding themselves into thinking that in this way the CPUSA can gradually assume a leading role in some broad progressive coalition, and eventually show Americans the limitations of the Democrats and the necessity for socialism.\n\nAn example of how closely the CPUSA tails the Dems is that in 2016 they endorsed Hillary Clinton over Bernie in the primaries, since they thought Bernie wouldn't \"unite\" enough voters around him.\n\nThat being said, the CPUSA still put out lots of good materials, some of which you can find in a thread linking to [Marxist works on US history](https:\/\/uselectionatlas.org\/FORUM\/index.php?topic=202462.0) that myself and others have scanned.","created_utc":1530391071,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"GucciMinhLaborwave","body":"Firstly, it is not true that fascism is only the fighting organisation of the bourgeoisie. Fascism is not only a military-technical category. Fascism is the bourgeoisie\u2019s fighting organisation that relies on the active support of Social-Democracy. Social-Democracy is objectively the moderate wing of fascism. There is no ground for assuming that the fighting organisation of the bourgeoisie can achieve decisive successes in battles, or in governing the country, without the active support of Social-Democracy. \n\n\nThere is just as little ground for thinking that Social-Democracy can achieve decisive successes in battles, or in governing the country, without the active support of the fighting organisation of the bourgeoisie. These organisations do not negate, but supplement each other. They are not antipodes, they are twins. Fascism is an informal political bloc of these two chief organisations; a bloc, which arose in the circumstances of the post-war crisis of imperialism, and which is intended for combating the proletarian revolution. The bourgeoisie cannot retain power without such a bloc. It would therefore be a mistake to think that \u201cpacifism\u201d signifies the liquidation of fascism. In the present situation, \u201cpacifism\u201d is the strengthening of fascism with its moderate, Social-Democratic wing pushed into the forefront. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/archive\/stalin\/works\/1924\/09\/20.htm","created_utc":1530394886,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}
