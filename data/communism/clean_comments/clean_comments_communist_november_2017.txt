Verso, which has its problems, says [this](https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/3102-how-we-wrote-armed-insurrection) about the book:\n\n&gt; This book, published secretly in Germany (in German) in 1928 and reprinted in an illegal second edition in 1931, was the work of a team of German communist military specialists in Moscow, under the direction of \u201cAlfred\u201d (pseudonym of Ture Lehen, an officer first in the Finnish and later in the Soviet Army), 'Alfred' was assigned to the Comintern (Piatnitsky) by the Red Army Staff. At first the names of all the co-authors were to be given on the title-page (my pseudonym was \u201cWalter\u201d). However, since this made a terribly long (\u201clanger\u201d) name for a relatively small book, we banded together under the name \u201cAlfred Langer.\u201d\n\nFinally, at long last after getting [a clue](https://books.google.com/books?id=kF1bAAAAcAAJ&amp;q=%22the+road+to+victory%22+alfred+lange&amp;dq=%22the+road+to+victory%22+alfred+lange&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjO8KG_iJzXAhVE5iYKHR5ND_gQ6AEIMTAC) from Google Books, I found that Road to Victory.

Cuba's current infrastructure mainly relies on an expensive satellite hookup through the [Intersputnik system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersputnik).\n\nThe real challenge is technical:\n\nTo make it accessible from home, you'd need to bury the internet lines parallel to each road. Cuba has around 61,000 km of roads, implying the need of a bare minimum of 61,000 km of fiber optic. In reality, you'd need more than one cable to meet demand, which implies a need for far greater than 61,000 km of fiber optic.\n\nNext, you need a fairly reliable energy source to maintain the infrastructure needed to keep a reliable connection to the outside. With the embargo, even that is challenging.\n\nThere are some experiments with things like Mesh networks that try to combat some of these issues, but only so much can be done wirelessly.","created_utc":1509588065,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"WeaponizedBlue","body":"The way I see it is that we acknowledge the supremacy of class because issues of things like race or gender are *themselves* issues of class. Different races in the United States have faced different material conditions and have developed differently. As such the modern material conditions differ between races as do their relative interests. To some extent, all white people benefit from the oppression of black people in the US, just as Americans in general benefit from the cheap labor and resources taken from the Global South. These benefits can be direct, such as preferential treatment for jobs, or indirect, such as simply having more capital circulating in the economy (even if it mostly ends up in the hands of the bourgeoisie).\n\nThis is really what the term \"privileged\" originally meant. Your privilege corresponds to your position within the global labor hierarchy, which is determined by whose labor you benefit from and who benefits from yours. These relationships play a big part in creating the material conditions each group is exposed to, which in turn influences their material interests.    \n\nWhenever the bourgeoisie create these divisions they incorporate a justification into their ideology (the poor are lazy, other races are inferior, women are made to raise children, etc...). They don't actually care if, or even strictly believe, these things are true, they are a means to secure a certain societal organization that maximizes exploitation of specific subclasses to the benefit of others, (but mostly themselves). So far the Liberal response to this has been to treat these issues independently, as \"attitude problems\" rather than deep structural realities. The results of struggling on this belief are pretty obvious, MLK died in 1968 and black people still aren't even close to being treated equally. To truly attack these issues, we have to see how they relate to the wider picture. \n\n\nSimply changing the economic system of the US isn't enough to solve all the problems faced by all parts of the proletariat.

{"author":"Dr_Girlfriend","body":"I recommend looking into critical race theory, because much of its historical and contemporary thinkers share these same observations and conclusions. Crit race theorists provide good historical analysis, discuss how the bourgeois state bureaucracy administers racism, and define neoliberalism in terms of dividing the proletariat.\n\nMuch of crit race theory details how the proletariat was racialized into separate categories and pitted against each other by the bourgeois state to fight over the same small piece of the pie. For example, for newly-arrived Irish immigrants treated similar to black Americans there were store signs like \"Irish need not apply.\" These Irish immigrants were racialized as \"non-white\" at the time. Blackness was linked with subjugation and whiteness was dangled like a carrot on a stick. Yet, instead of allying with black workers to fight for a bigger piece of the pie together, these immigrants eventually absorbed America's racism and over time became racialized as a \"white people.\"\n\nThe bourgeois state used racial minority groups against each other, thus further cementing the state's categorization of race. For example, Theodore Roosevelt pushed to incorporate black soldiers, called Buffalo Soldiers, around 1866 against the American Indians in the Indian wars. These groups should have become a mass movement against their mutual oppressor. Black men were barely tolerated in the army, but the Buffalo Soldiers were made into a model minority to incentivize attacking American Indian rebels.\n\nCrit race theorists' work also provides examples of how since the state leverages racial minorities against each other, even racial minorities are unable to show solidarity with each other or that such alliances are weak and short-lived. In contrast, the best examples of when these groups overcame competing against each other were when they correctly identified their mutual oppressor and saw each other suffering the same predicament. One example of this is when Seminole Indians in Florida and elsewhere gave refuge to escaped black slaves, who later became known as Seminole blacks. Another example was of Irish immigrant U.S. soldiers the Mexican American war. They switched sides after identifying with the oppression of Mexicans and became known as St Patrick's Batallion. They realized both groups are Catholic and that the Mexicans were being oppressed by the Americans the same way the British were oppressing the Irish.\n\nThe racialization of people emerged from capitalism and imperialism. That's not to say prejudice didn't exist, but it hasn't been racially categorized that way before. Racism was developed as a justification for imperialism and capitalism, which weakened the position of the proletariat from recognizing themselves as one. Since then racism is used by the bourgeois state to divide the proletariat in an economic battle royale so to speak. A clear example of this was the southern bourgeoisie actively dividing the white working class from identifying with black slaves or black workers after emancipation. Both the black and white proletariat are oppressed by capital, but the white proletariat is appeased with the notion that \"hey at least you're white not black, it could be worse.\" It generates a sense of fear of losing that little bit of favoritism, which only offers a promise of better treatment.\n\nCritical race theory proposes that whiteness was elevated by the bourgeoisie in order to win over the white working class and prevent them from identifying with the black working class. By categorizing white workers as a white race, the bourgeois state was able to realign the white proletariat's interests falsely with the interests of their white capitalist masters.\n\nAmerican capitalists basically turned race into a hierarchical racial ladder, where white is on top and black is on bottom. The message they gave the rest of the proletariat was that to be black is to be marginalized from society and economic opportunity. This incentivizes the proletariat to remain divided against each other and still fighting over the table scraps tossed out by their bourgeois masters. \n\nThis is why we need to critically and openly discuss race while weeding out the non-materialist analysis of race that's running rampant, including even in some comments here. It has achieved little and is preventing the emancipation of the very marginalized racial groups that this line of thinking professes to support. Yes the experiences of oppression may differ, but the oppressor is always the same and so is the cure!","created_utc":1509663264,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

These relationships play a big part in creating the material conditions each group is exposed to, which in turn influences their material interests.\n\nYes this! This understanding of privilege used to be fairly widespread in the 80s and 90s, but probably got lost in modern discourse because of a surge in \"End of History\" thinking.\n\n&gt;Simply changing the economic system of the US isn't enough to solve all the problems faced by all parts of the proletariat. We have to dismantle the hegemony of Imperialism that exists in much of the West and replace it with a doctrine of mutual development.\n\nMaybe I'm misinterpreting your point, but communism isn't about changing the economic system. Capitalism isn't just an economic system, it's a political economy upon which the whole of society is structured. Negating capitalism means all social relations will have to change with it too. \n\nAlso, communism being the real movement against capitalism means it has to be internationalist, because capitalism is a global system and imperialism is an inherent process within it.\n\n&gt;Of course we are all fundamentally equal and share a degree of commonality, but our struggles are all unique.\n\nHow are all struggles unique? Doesn't this notion just buy into the alienation generated by capitalism by fragmenting struggle. How does that aid the proletariat in a communist movement against capitalism?\n\nWhile everything I wrote above is my understanding of theory, I personally think class is the sole unifier of disparate groups of people. It's why as communists we see the proletariat as the means for achieving freedom and better lives for all marginalized groups. \n\nAlso there is social research, (for example studies into school board issues in predominantly black and Latino school districts), supporting the observation that most cross-group alliances/coalitions fail or don't last very long when they don't share a common struggle for a common purpose. This supports what we've seen historically and explains why non-materialist struggles have failed to end their oppression or radically change social relations.\n\nYet, the liberal criticism of class struggle is accepted wholesale without examining if that argument has any merit, or whether it's even viable for the proletariat.\n\nFor example, let's take the issue of police brutality which is both racial and non-racial. Yet, acknowledging the racism alone and fighting it as a form of racism hasn't defeated oppression via policing for decades. Why?\n\nModern policing grew out of protecting capital interests against the poor in London, since those very interests created the material conditions for many crimes. In America, policing has a basis in slave-catchers and similarly protecting capital's interests. The very existence of slavery was to serve capital and racism was the justification. When slavery ended, policing became the way to continue the subjugation of black people.\n\nAt the same time, policing inherently generates contempt amongst the law enforcement for the people they police. The Stanford Prison Experiment is a good example of this contempt that when actionable becomes brutality. Also, the Milgram experiments show how group think and the idea of \"just doing my job\" can push people to brutalize others. So in addition to the racism of modern policing, there's structural problems that reinforce the brutal nature of policing itself.\n\nAs strategy, this broader critique of how police violence puts all of us at risk needs to be connected with its racial critique. To me that's what intersectionality means from a materialist perspective.","created_utc":1509670260,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

That was a fault on my part.  \n\nIn addition I also agree that we should march towards Socialism together, but I described all our struggles as \"unique\" to emphasize that the methodology we employ will differ depending on conditions. As such it is important to consider the realities each race or group faces when determining what to do. \n\nThe reason I think its important to add this footnote to our general principle of unified struggle and equality is that class consciousness must extend further than one's own subclass of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. We must recognize that even though we may all be proletarians, (or at least class conscious petit-bourgeoisie), but our material interests may not fully align or even clash in some senses, as is common between the Imperial Core and the Global South with the demand for cheap labor and resources. So when working together to untangle the web of class relations that is capitalism, we must consider issues of race and gender and how they contribute to that material reality. \n\nMy point was more to critique the idea that issues of race are a \"distraction\" from issues of class (as they are fundamentally inseparable), rather than to propose a course of action.

{"author":"DeLaProle","body":"I think you're speaking of the Federalist Papers, yes? There are 85 of them, and they are written mostly by Hamilton and Madison. I don't know the exact essay to which you are referring (I haven't read them all) but No. 10, by Madison, specifically regards 'factions' (such as property owners vs propertyless) if that's what you're talking about. It doesn't mention congress specifically (other issues do) but he is arguing for a republican government on the basis that a democratic government wouldn't be able to deal with the conflicting factions. \n  \n&gt;The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man; and we see them everywhere brought into different degrees of activity, according to the different circumstances of civil society. A zeal for different opinions concerning religion, concerning government, and many other points, as well of speculation as of practice; an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for pre-eminence and power; or to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions, have, in turn, divided mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to co-operate for their common good. So strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities, that where no substantial occasion presents itself, the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts. **But the most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society**. Those who are creditors, and those who are debtors, fall under a like discrimination. A landed interest, a manufacturing interest, a mercantile interest, a moneyed interest, with many lesser interests, grow up of necessity in civilized nations, and divide them into different classes, actuated by different sentiments and views. **The regulation of these various and interfering interests forms the principal task of modern legislation, and involves the spirit of party and faction in the necessary and ordinary operations of the government.**   \n  \n..  \n  \n&gt;The inference to which we are brought is, that the CAUSES of faction cannot be removed, and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its EFFECTS.  \n  \n..  \n  \n&gt;**From this view of the subject it may be concluded that a pure democracy, by which I mean a society consisting of a small number of citizens, who assemble and administer the government in person, can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction**. A common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication and concert result from the form of government itself; and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual. Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.  \n  \n..  \n  \n&gt;The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States. A religious sect may degenerate into a political faction in a part of the Confederacy; but the variety of sects dispersed over the entire face of it must secure the national councils against any danger from that source. **A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the Union than a particular member of it**; in the same proportion as such a malady is more likely to taint a particular county or district, than an entire State.\n\n&gt;In the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore, we behold a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government. And according to the degree of pleasure and pride we feel in being republicans, ought to be our zeal in cherishing the spirit and supporting the character of Federalists.","created_utc":1509769282,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"GenosseMarx","body":"&gt; Reactionary \u00e9migr\u00e9s fleeing Soviet Russia, and later the Soviet Union, were usually the primary sources for this and later propaganda campaigns against the USSR. The first major wave of \u00e9migr\u00e9s was the White Russians; one of the major sources of anti-Communist material in this early period was a virulently anti-Semitic, 12,000-word pamphlet titled \u201cCrimes of the Bolsheviks,\u201d published in Munich in 1926. One of the fables concocted by the pseudonymous author \u201cDr. Gregor,\u201d in the section titled \u201cFiendish tortures devised by the Jewish Cheka,\u201d alleged that Soviet torturers forced rats to eat through the bodies of helpless Christians. This story about rats was later borrowed for the grim conclusion of George Orwell\u2019s 1984. From then until now, the primary sources for anti-Communist agit-prop are fascists, whose stories are filtered out to various target audiences through different salespeople.\n\n&gt; Anti-communism is, if not an expression of fascism itself, proximate to fascism. Orwell provides a perfect example. This might sound shocking to someone who only knows Eric Blair as the patron saint of the permissible left, but as could be expected of a lifelong anti-communist, he was a man of retrograde attitudes. In his infamous \u201cOrwell\u2019s list,\u201d in which he snitched on suspected communists, socialist, and various progressives, he noted everyone he suspected of being Jewish (Charlie Chaplin earned a \u201cJew?\u201d in the margins of Orwell\u2019s list). Next to Paul Robeson, the black communist who fought for social justice alongside progressives of all races his entire life, Orwell wrote \u201cvery antiwhite.\u201d Orwell believed the contemporary neo-Nazis slogan that \u201canti-racist\u201d is code for \u201canti-white.\u201d\n\n[I really don't know how much gullibility we can grant Orwell.](https://lorenzoae.wordpress.com/2017/10/11/on-russia-todays-liberals/amp/)","created_utc":1509871548,"score":16,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Burgovski","body":"There's around 5% unemployment in the US currently, that's a huge amount of people and this number doesn't even include people that are employed, but working jobs they are overqualified for. So it obviously exists under that definition and I'd also say it's one of the underlying principles of the labour market under modern capitalism.\n\n\nI'm not sure exactly what kind of control you mean, but it is mostly used as leverage to the actual labour force, both in wages and keeping them \"obedient\" for lack of a better word as I'll explain. This force of unemployed people is heavily directed towards, unsurprisingly, finding a job, both by the heavy propaganda surrounding unemployment, making it out to be a choice, and by the actual material conditions of people unable to provide for themselves without a job. So you have a mass of unemployed people, most of which are desperately looking to find work so they aren't stigmatised and/or starving. \n\n\nHow this is exploited is quite interesting. There's different layers of underemployment with unemployed people at the lowest level. Then you have people working low wage jobs, such as cashiers. The lowest level is used to make them disposable. They can be fired at any time and replaced within weeks, if not days, by one of those people desperately looking for work I mentioned earlier. Consequently, this forces people to tolerate low wage jobs and other injustices and very unlikely to unionise. Then there's the low-level specialised jobs, let's imagine an entry level IT job for instance, where the unemployed people or people in low-wage jobs that they are overqualified for (let's say IT graduates sitting at home or working as starbucks baristas), are used as leverage against them, making them disposable and keeping their wages lower as well. \n\n\nI think Marx makes the same point about wages and how the availability of the reserve army dictates them, but he didn't imagine how the modern environment of today would make people just as incredibly disposable as they are. Nowadays if there's a job opening at the starbucks in your town, chances are almost every other unemployed person living in your town also applied for it, all through the power of the internet.

However, Shell was paying the military to conduct raids on innocent people and those who were protesting Shell destroying their environment in the Niger Delta. A few, the Ogoni Nine, which included Ken Saro-Wiwa, ended up being hung in order to suppress the protesting against Shell.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogoni_Nine\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Saro-Wiwa\n\nMany of these supposed witnesses later admitted that they had been bribed by the Nigerian government to support the criminal allegations. At least two witnesses who testified that Saro-Wiwa was involved in the murders of the Ogoni elders later recanted, stating that they had been bribed with money and offers of jobs with Shell to give false testimony, in the presence of Shell's lawyer.\n\nShort 10 min documentary about it - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htF5XElMyGI - The Case Against Shell: 'The Hanging of Ken Saro-Wiwa Showed the True Cost of Oil'\n\nOther links/resources:\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/dec/08/wikileaks-cables-shell-nigeria-spying\n\nThe oil giant Shell claimed it had inserted staff into all the main ministries of the Nigerian government, giving it access to politicians' every move in the oil-rich Niger Delta, according to a leaked US diplomatic cable.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Saro-Wiwa\n\nHis death provoked international outrage and the immediate suspension of Nigeria from the Commonwealth of Nations, as well as the calling back of many foreign diplomats for consultation. The United States and other countries considered imposing economic sanctions.\n\nBeginning in 1996, the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), EarthRights International (ERI), Paul Hoffman of Schonbrun, DeSimone, Seplow, Harris &amp; Hoffman and other human rights attorneys have brought a series of cases to hold Shell accountable for alleged human rights violations in Nigeria, including summary execution, crimes against humanity, torture, inhumane treatment and arbitrary arrest and detention. The lawsuits are brought against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of its Nigerian operation.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiwa_family_lawsuits_against_Royal_Dutch_Shell\n\nOn June 8, 2009, Shell settled out-of-court with the Saro-Wiwa family for $15.5 million. Ben Amunwa, director of the Remember Saro-Wiwa organization, said that \"No company, that is innocent of any involvement with the Nigeria military and human rights abuses, would settle out of court for 15.5 million dollars.

The Bolshevik Revolution overthrew the oppressive rich and gave rise to the Soviet Union which is what the majority of Russian people wanted, having a political philosophy incompatible with enabling their exploitation, the accumulation of wealth beyond reason to the detriment of the rest of society, and the indignity of inequality.\n\nOver the past century, the rich few have done their absolute best to inflate the number of people who they lost that couldn't peacefully let the people of Russia govern themselves to the point where their criminal actions lead to the deaths of many people and to really spit in the face of justice then blamed those same people for the loss of life, and subject other non-criminal fascist apologists to freedom from exploitation, violence, and untold devastation brought on by themselves via class warfare. These movements, when explained without the false pretense of liberty, systematically robbed the upper class of what they claim is a part of human nature but actually has nothing to do with it - greed, inflation of self importance, the freedom to force inequality within every social aspect imaginable, and countless other rights that the rich few use to stay on top. The fallen upper class, yearning for freedom to live as lavishly as possible on the backs of absolutely everyone else, had thankfully been subjugated by the state through the use of a prison system that is surprisingly similar to the current US prison system.\n\nToday, the bourgeois remember the victory of the proletariat in disdain, and all of those people who continue to escape their exploitation, all that money they could have. In their memory and in honor of the fanaticism of those who have fought courageously to spread fascism and the exploitation of others around the world, the oligarchs of our Nation reaffirm their steadfast resolve to darken the hope of laborers and for all who yearn for a brighter, freer future without them.","created_utc":1510145793,"score":18,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"MrSkullgrinder","body":"That is great news!\n\nI love how the artice is worded as to make both the DPRK and China sound as shady and corrupt as possible.\n\n&gt; (...) curb North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un's nuclear weapons program by squeezing his ability to fund the program, and forcing the regime to negotiate.\n\nFirst they refer to democratically elected Kim Jung Un as a dictator, but I guess anyone who does not obey the proto fascist U$ is a dictator huh? Of course unlike the Orange orangutan in the white house who managed to win without the popular vote... That in *no way* sounds like how a dictator comes into power. *No* not at all. They also somehow fail to mention the DPRK has attempted to negotiate countless times. Surely that was an *accident*.\n\n&gt; Journalists, CBS News quickly found out, are less welcome. Just 10 minutes after Tracy and his team arrived on a street lined with North Korean businesses in Dandong, they we were stopped by Chinese police. \n\nNo! Say it is not so! Not the western journalists! Jesus.... It is almost as if a sovereign nation would not like a western imperialist news source filming their private transactions.\n\n&gt; The police deleted CBS News' video of goods being sent to the North, so Tracy's team used an iPhone to shoot video from a building nearby, from which we could see what appeared to be construction materials and heavy machinery heading toward the bridge over the Yalu.\n\nThat is quite literally illegal. Now imagine this exact same situation but it is a transaction between the U$ and Japan. The CBS team was literally spying on a sovereign nation and acting as though they are the Victims. They should be jailed or at least banned from nation. \n\n&gt; But as Tracy reports, China refuses to cut North Korea off at the knees, because it fears if the Kim regime collapses, refugees from the North will stream across the border into China. Worse yet, China worries it would see the U.S. military just across the Yalu River.\n\nI love that projection from all *Knowledgeable* Tracy. I highly doubt China is protecting the DPRK because they are worried about having to deal with scary refugees... They are not the U$. That second point is very much true, but I wonder how the U$ would feel if China took over Mexico and was on their doorstep... I love how they also do not consider that maybe they are illegally trading with and protecting the DPRK because they do not want to see them genocided and starve? Maybe they actually care about a sovereign people that is not their own and do not seem them as just dollar signs? Nah it is obviously just for selfish refugee reasons.\n\n\nGod liberals make me feel like I lose brain cells every time I listen to them.\n\nAww it is cute the liberals at enoughcommiespam think so highly of me.

{"author":"intlnews","body":"Well the WWP will have a convention [later this month](https://www.workers.org/wwp/2017conference/) to chart a strategy and way forward. and the PSL recently held a Soviet. So the PSL [argues that](http://www.pslweb.org/about):\n\n&gt; ...the only solution to the deepening crisis of capitalism is the socialist transformation of society...capitalism is on a collision course with the people of the world and the planet itself...For the great majority of people in the world, including tens of millions of workers in the United States, conditions of life and work are worsening. There is no prospect that this situation can or will be turned around under the existing system.\nThe idea that the capitalists\u2019 grip on society and their increasingly repressive state can be abolished through any means other than a revolutionary overturn is an illusion. Equally unrealistic are reformist hopes for a \u201ckinder, gentler\u201d capitalism, or solutions based on economic decentralization or small group autonomy. Meeting the needs of the more than 6.5 billion people who inhabit the planet today is impossible without large-scale agriculture and industry and economic planning...There are really only two choices for humanity today\u2014an increasingly destructive capitalism, or socialism.\n\nThey partially expand on it [here](http://www.pslweb.org/join)\n\nAnd the WWP which has a [10-point program](https://www.workers.org/wwp/our-program/):\n\n&gt; The rebellions in Baltimore and Ferguson were righteous acts of indignation and should be defended by the working-class movement... Support self-determination for Black, Latinx, Indigenous, Asian and Arab peoples...Capitalism cannot be reformed. We need revolutionary socialism \u2013 a system of people\u2019s power, where the worker and oppressed peoples, not the banks and corporations, own and control everything...Although progressive changes should be supported, they do not go far enough; the whole rotten system must be overturned...We support LGBTQ people in the fight for self-determination, trans and gender liberation, and against co-optation of LGBTQ issues such as \u201cpinkwashing\u201d by Israel...All of humanity, including non-human species, is at risk, and only extreme measures can save us and other species. Socialism is the only system capable of taking those measures...We oppose NATO, the war on Syria and the encirclement of Russia and China, threats against People\u2019s Korea and the revolutionary movement in Venezuela...We demand a system where all contribute according to their abilities and receive according to their needs.\n\nI guess you could call that more of a strategy and [maybe a socialist front](https://www.workers.org/wwp/who-we-are/what-we-are-fighting-for/socialist-unity/) is part of that:\n\n&gt; Socialists across the world need to unite. The need for such unity is all the more urgent here in the U.S., because the capitalist system here remains at the center of world imperialism. A socialist front of organizations, parties and individuals \u2014 whose agreement on fundamental questions outweighs whatever differences they might have \u2014 could greatly advance the work of revolutionaries on many levels... A new socialist unity must strengthen internationalism. Workers, the oppressed and poor people everywhere must know that they have steadfast class allies in the U.S.... Socialist unity needs to be centered in the struggle of the working class.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not a member of the PSL or WWP but they have better approach than Socialist Alternative by far.

{"author":"MsExmusThrowAway","body":"&gt;The question here is : did the Muslim support came from pragmatic or ideological reasons? Really interesting question\n\nI'd have to say pragmatic. We can look at multiple cases where devout Muslims sided with socialist/communists only because they were fighting a much bigger enemy (Christian empires, western imperialism, Zionism, etc.). The real question is: how many devout and traditionalist Muslims would side with communists over Muslim theocrats? How many would be willing to abolish private property and markets when shariah generally allows for such things? Plus, when the Qur'an talks about struggle, it's not talking about a struggle between classes in the Marxist sense, but a struggle between believers and non-believers (in other words, a struggle of truth).\n\nI'm speaking as someone who came from a conservative Muslim family. I think the Muslim family unit does much more to fester reactionary views in Muslims than the religion itself. All the males I knew were constantly pressured into becoming successful within a capitalist framework, since they're expected to not only support their wives and kids but also their parents and their wives' parents (notice how much the family structure is tied into relations of production?). Not being able to make loads of money is considered shameful, because it indicates that you weren't strong or clever enough to dominate the system. Obviously, the end result is a ton of pressure.

Goods containing 100 hours of US labour, when exported to Mexico exchange for goods containing perhaps 400 hours of Mexican labour. Thus even allowing for the fact that she only gets back in wages about half the labour she puts in, **worker in the US can obtain for an hours work goods that took a couple of hours labour by Mexican workers.**\n\nInteresting **admission**!\n\n&gt; As less developed economies are opened up to competition with developed ones, this process repeats itself. Labour performed in pre-state of the art conditions, is devalued. But this is an inevitable effect of the exchange process. For in exchange, the social status of private labours, is established by equating use values, and this presupposes self-identity. Thus the equation\n\n&gt;1 kilo of maize = 1 kilo of maize\n\n&gt;must hold. So as the Mexican maize market is opened up to the products of US agriculture, **1 kilo of maize produced by a peasant in Chiapas becomes equivalent to 1 kilo of US maize that might embody only a 10th or a 20th as much labour**, and with this the labour of the peasant is further devalued. \n\nAnd so we see, the author *believes* the old lie that workers in the advanced capitalist countries are 10 (nay, 20!) times *more* productive than their counterparts in the developing world. The author pulls out the concept of 'socially necessary labor' to justify this notion, as if it were some magical incantation that allowed one to justify any sort of nonsense and call it Marxism.\n\nDid it ever occur to the author that it is the labor aristocracy itself that wants to command a higher price for their labor than is *socially necessary*, hence why their jobs are being outsourced in the first place?\n\nMoreover, there is a reality problem here. People making t-shirts and phones in developing countries aren't doing these things with sticks and stones. The capitalists export the exact same machinery they were using in the first place, and just pay *someone else* much lower wages to do the *same* work (often these wages still being fairly decent, compared to the other jobs on the market).\n\nIn fact, if reality were as he described it, outsourcing would never happen. *If* advanced capitalist country workers were somehow not only more productive (and by implication, *more exploited*!), then capitalists would never outsource anything period!

I\u2019m just happy to be here.\u201d\n\nThe march, organized by a group called the National Radical Camp, underscores the rightward politics of a growing section of Polish youth. The Radical Camp presents itself as the heir to a 1930s fascist movement of the same name, which fought to rid Poland of Jews in the years just before the Holocaust. A second group, All Polish Youth, also named after an anti-Jewish interwar movement, co-organized it.\n\nOfficials in the city government said they thought the march reflected poorly on Poland, but they said they had no choice but to approve the demonstration, as it fulfilled the legal requirements: It qualified as a celebration of Polish history. \u201cThis is not the type of event I would take my children to,\u201d said Agnieszka K\u0142\u0105b, spokesperson for the Warsaw City Council.\n\nThe Radical Camp has been holding independence-day marches since 2009. Until several years ago, it struggled to attract more than a few hundred people. In the past three years, it has become the largest independence-day occasion in Poland, and one of the largest nationalist marches of its kind anywhere in Europe. Saturday\u2019s was expected to be the largest ever. Police estimated the crowd at 60,000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting more and more vicious,\u201d said Jakub Skrzypek, 25, one of about a dozen counterprotesters standing behind a banner that read \u201cWe Are Polish Jews\u201d and surrounded by police. \u201cWe are really in fear.\u201d\n\nThe Radical Camp\u2019s followers argue, on their social-media accounts and in their literature, that the influx of Syrian refugees into Europe is part of a conspiracy driven by Jewish financiers, who are working with Communists in the European Union to bring Muslims into Europe, and with them, Shariah law and homosexuality.\n\nThe group has regularly held events to mark a 1936 pogrom against Jews. Its symbols were displayed on a banner that appeared over a Warsaw bridge, reading: \u201cPray for Islamic Holocaust.\u201d\n\nThis year, the group said it was adopting a new slogan, a quote from a July speech here by President Donald Trump : \u201cWe want God.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis march is just an expression of a bigger social phenomenon, which is definitely very troubling, and is the growing acceptance of extreme nationalism and xenophobia among young people in Poland,\u201d said Rafal Pankowski, a political-science professor at private university Collegium Civitas in Warsaw. \u201cIt is a contrast: Polish parents and grandparents are paradoxically more liberal than their young.\u201d\n\n\nRichard Spencer, an American until recently banned from 26 European countries who wants to create a country just for white people in North America, was invited. The Polish government asked him to stay home, and he didn\u2019t show up. Roberto Fiore, an Italian anti-immigration politician who describes himself as a fascist, was scheduled to appear.\n\nSome Poles on Facebook and Twitter said they were staying away from the city center on their country\u2019s independence day, to avoid potential violence. Three previous years\u2019 marches devolved into tear-gas-clouded scuffles with police. Police detained at least 45 people Saturday.\n\nThe crowds drawn to Saturday\u2019s march reflect the politics taking hold in the soccer clubs and youth hangouts where Radical Camp recruits. The group holds a staunch nativist standpoint, saying the European Union and Russia represent equal threats to Polish sovereignty. It argues that Polish people should nationalize the assets belonging to foreign corporations and distribute the profits across an ethnically homogenous state\n\nSimilar movements have taken hold\u2014even captured seats in parliament\u2014in Hungary, Slovakia and Czech Republic. Some of these countries are among Europe\u2019s most prospering. Poland is the only country in the EU that didn\u2019t experience a single quarter of economic contraction after the financial crisis.\n\nStill, the fear that Poland is under siege by distant elites has captured the imagination of some here, as has the worry that hordes of immigrants could soon pour over the border. Government-controlled media broadcasts near-nightly reports on crimes committed by Muslims in Europe. On Saturday, Polish state television called the procession a \u201cgreat march of patriots.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like this inner need we have,\u201d said Lukasz, a 24-year-old protester. \u201cWe want a Poland that will be for Polish people.\u201d \"","created_utc":1510567696,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"hurderur","body":"&gt;A convincing argument\n\nThank you!\n\n&gt;You have overlooked that the value of labour-power is greater in the first world countries.\n\nI haven't overlooked it; I am denying this is true.\n\n&gt;This is because the cost of living (maintaining, reproducing, etc. the labour-power) is greater than the third world countries.\n\nThis is only somewhat true. *Some* things are cheaper, such as transportation costs (however, gas prices are the same basically everywhere), food that is not imported, and very often, rent. And this is usually only the case because of extensive government intervention (China is a good example of this). Most other things, however, are comparable in price. A cup of coffee in China is actually *more expensive* than in America!\n\nWhen you actually look at the costs of these things *as a percentage* of wages in the advanced capitalist countries versus the developing countries, very often they are spending a larger percentage of their wages on these same things, even if they are cheaper.\n\nSo in general, as far as the exchange of *most* commodities available to people globally, the labor of the workers in the advanced capitalist countries allows them to consume significantly more globally exchanged commodities than workers in other countries.\n\n&gt;Then from this fact it follows that outsourcing will occur even if wages were reduced to the socially necessary minimums -- the capitalists can extract more surplus value this way.\n\nOutsourcing occurs because there is a potential for greater profits, which necessarily implies more surplus value is being extracted, and hence, the new workers are being *more* exploited than the ones they are replacing. To deny this is to suggest strange things happen, like advanced capitalist country workers are not only more productive, but more exploited, and that outsourcing their jobs actually *lowers* the amount of surplus value being generated for the capitalist, yet profits still go up!\n\nI don't think you could torture the math to pull that trick off.\n\n&gt;Then an hour of a first world worker's time can be worth two of a third world worker's in wages, without the former exploiting the latter.\n\nWould you also believe this statement to be true in an *idealized* socialist society? In such a society, 1 hour of your labor would allow you to purchase any service or commodity with an equal amount of labor embodied in it. Is this were violated, you could say people with different jobs making higher wages *are* exploiting the other people in the hypothetical society. Their wages would allow them to *consume* the labor of others.\n\nThat this could happen within a single idealized socialist society implies it could definitely happen in the real world, or even within a single company! Why do some people in a corporation make $100,000 a year for sitting at their desks and holding frivolous meetings once a week, and other people in a single corporation make pennies doing all the *productive* work? Do you also imagine corporate middle-managers are exploited proletarians without even knowing it?","created_utc":1510582813,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

The productive forces did not exist in 1949 for socialism to be built.\n\nRemember the material conditions are not made but adapted to.\n\nThe War of National Liberation was not a socialist revolution, it was a nationalist one. While it was led by the CPC as the vanguard, it was very much a war of national liberation from imperialism. There simply was not a large enough working class or modes of production for there to be a dictatorship of the proletariat.\n\nRemember material conditions are.adapted to, not made.\n\nThe PRC attempted to create the productive forces using what Mao called New Democracy. This is similar to Lenin's NEP in the USSR but adapted to Chinese conditions.\n\nOne of the efforts of New Democracy was The Great Leap Forward. This was a quite successful effort to begin the synthesized stage of capitalism led by a vanguard party using mass line.\n\nThe productive forces still did not exist for socialism. It had only been a decade since the War of National Liberation. You cannot create capitalist modes of production in a decade. It took western countires hundreds of years.\n\nRemeber, we adapt to the conditions, we do not make them.\n\nThe era of The Great Proletarian Revolution was not one dealing with the economic revolution nor the political revolution. As the name implies, it was an attempt to culturally prepare the masses for socialism. It came damn close to a complete cultural shift. Yet it was cut short by those who were more tentative within the party of the rapid change to society. I disagree with the party in their reversal of the GPCR. \n\nBut the productive forces of China still did not exist for socialism.\n\nWe adapt to the conditiond we do not make them.\n\nThe era of Deng Xiaoping was one we like to call \"the great experiment\". The market reforms were implemented not to reverse the revolution but to quicken the capitalist stage. And guess what? It worked.\n\nChina created the productive forces of capitalism in a fraction of the time of any other country on the planet.\n\nNow today in 2017, Xi Jingping and the party recognize this. If BRG payed any attention to the 19th Party Congress last month, he would know this.\n\nXi Jinping has reimplemented mass line, reintroduced marxism in schools, and has stopped mass privitization in its tracks. \n\nThe material conditions no exist to a transfer of the means of production to the working class. \n\nThough this is not done overnight.\n\nTo address the issue of Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao. They were absolutely capitalist roadsters and had not interest in preparing China for socialism. Under them rampant corruption and abandoment of marxism was apparent.\n\nThe party has finally been purged 5 years later of these poisons eroding the line of the party.\n\nFinally I would like to say a few thing, through the guidance of the CPC The PRC was able to always hold on to a semblance of socialism and democratic.centralism.\n\nThere were many misteps and mistakes but in the end, Is China Socialist? Yes, yes, a thousand times yes.\n\nEdit:\n\nI write a post about the historical and modern economic conditions of the country I call home, and I get a bunch of people trying to define a certain type of Maoism, totally ignoring the original point and resorting to a \"no true scotsman\" fallacy that does not even relate to my original post.

The brief history of socialism in Ireland basically picks the start of the 20th century as the beginning, discounting the decided left wing trend of Irish republicanism from the United Irishmen onwards - the politics of connolly were greatly influenced by this history. Also the recap of left wing groups leaves a bit to be desired. There is no mention at all of the Republican Congress which was imo the most exciting left wing initiative of the first half of the 20th century.\nOne of the presenters was somewhat annoying as he constantly came out with profanities - I don't like hearing people being called cunts and I doubt female listeners will either. Although I agree the DUP are very bad.\nAlso the same presenter had some very odd comments on Irish republicanism and nationalism and seemed delighted at the prospect of revisionist history! Did he mean the Peter Hart variety? \nHe seems to completely disregard the need for cooperation with elements of bourgeois nationalism during anti imperialist struggle. (up to a point). James Connolly and the ICA are a perfect example of this, he recognised the progressive aspects of the advanced nationalists. These progressive aspects as still to be found in Sinn Fein. \nAlso there was zero mention of right 2 change!\nAlthough for three trots the discussion was good. Ha. I tried to subscribe on podcast addict but I couldn't find it using the search.\nI'm not having a go, I enjoyed it and am disagreeing in a comradly fashion.

They have always hated Zimbabwe after the destruction of Rhodesia. One of the reasons China has been investing in Zimbabwe, building up tourism apparatus near the Victoria Falls, and helping the country with infrastructure. Zimbabwe even uses the yuan as its currency. Part of the New-Silk Road.\n\nThat being said, this seems to be more an internal power struggle within the ZANU-PF. The army has said before that they wouldnt allow anyone who didnt take part in the revolution war itself to lead the country next (and Mugabe's wife did not serve during the war). I am more curious about if the accusations against the VP hold water. I am also very curious about why Mugabe has decided to pursue a route that seems to hand power to his wife, rather than his comrades from the struggle. \n\nWhatever disagreements exist, its clear that the overwhelming majority of the people in Zimbabwe love their revolution, and would never want to return to the apartheid settler regime of Rhodesia, or domination by the USA or Britain.\n\nWe should hope for a peaceful resolution, I will be very interested to see the full story as it develops.

{"author":"xplkqlkcassia","body":"Here's the three minute version, feel free to search around the subreddit for more or to ask me to elaborate on anything.\n\nThe modern PRC embarked on its developmental strategy in 1978. It involves 1) partnerships with Western firms in order to absorb their technology, 2) rapid and well-rounded development of productive forces through a limited market and foreign trade / investment, 3) rapid reduction of poverty, 4) total dominance of the CPC (Communist Party of China) in the political sphere, 5) total state-dominance and control in key sectors and semi-key sectors (finance, high-tech industry, mining, utilities, transportation, heavy machinery etc etc. - the largest 20 Chinese businesses are all state-controlled) 6) indirect mechanisms to exert state control over private businesses and 7) propagation of Marxism-Leninist thought in the education system and the media in order to counteract the influence of liberal ideology.\n\nThis developmental programme was explicitly intended to replicate the NEP, which was in effect in the USSR during the 1920s.\n\nA socialist country is where 1) socialist planning is the dominant force of the economy as opposed to the anarchy of the capitalist market (i.e capitalism has been dethroned as the dominant mode of production and has been largely supplanted by socialism), and 2) where the state is a proletarian dictatorship. This is arguable and it's a framework that obviously not all Marxist tendencies agree with, but for the sake of brevity, this is what I'll be going on. \n\nAs I've outlined briefly above, socialist planning is clearly the dominant force within the Chinese social formation.\n\nWhat about 2)? We know that the Chinese state can only be a bourgeois dictatorship or a proletarian dictatorship, not a mixture between the two or a \"dictatorship of the bureaucracy\" or whatever nonsense phrase Trotskyists use. If we can eliminate one possibility, the other must be true. Now, I put forward this questions - would a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie do this?\n\n* [Would a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, mandate re-education courses in Marxism for all government officials](https://news.vice.com/article/china-will-re-educate-government-officials-to-remind-them-that-communism-is-awesome)?\n\n* [Would a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, order all journalists and students of journalism to take courses in Marxism](http://www.scmp.com/news/china-insider/article/1299795/china-orders-nations-journalists-take-marxism-classes)?\n\n* [Would a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, step up the ideology drive on college campuses and introduce Mao Zedong thought classes in 2,600 universities](http://archive.is/6a1lf)?\n\n* [Would a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, deliberately ensure that average manufacturing wages have been rising consistently by ~11% per year at the expense of corporate profits](http://http://www.workers.org/2015/07/21/china-rising-wages-and-worker-militancy/), [compared to other \"developing\" countries like India where wages have stayed repressed for decades?](https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_800_800/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAK-AAAAJDVmOWVlYzg1LTgzOTAtNDhmMi1iMTM3LWZkNDUzNzkwZDM1ZQ.png)\n\n* [Would a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie roll out comprehensive social programmes in the middle of a neoliberal wave of austerity in the middle of the 2008 financial crisis?](https://www.workers.org/2013/06/13/marxism-and-the-social-character-of-china/)\n\n* [Would a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, in a situation where workers beat a steel executive to death due to privatization plans, step in, prevent workers from being prosecuted, and then reverse the privatization](https://www.workers.org/2015/07/21/china-rising-wages-and-worker-militancy/)?\n\nThe PRC is not a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The idea that the PRC is a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie is grossly inconsistent with everything we know about the PRC.\n\nThe PRC is a proletarian dictatorship (with different right-wing and left-wing trends within the CPC, but feel free to ask me about that), and the heights of industry (and a hella lot more) are coordinated in accordance with a democratically-formed, socialist economic plan.\n\nThis is enough for me to go ahead and say \"the PRC is socialist\". Is it for you? I don't know. What I do know is that you now probably have a solid understanding about \"how\" people think that China is socialist in any way.\n\n***\n\nOkay, here are some extra takes that I had left over by the time I finished typing all this.\n\n***\n\n**The timing of China's alternative development strategy**\n\nWe don't know whether the CPC's leadership coincidentally chose a fortunate time, or whether it was deliberately planned out, but the 70s and 80s were marked by violent crises of capitalism (fall in the general rate of profit). These crises forced the liberalization of trade and capital movement, so that capital could move elsewhere, to find cheaper labour. All of the Western world was looking for a new place to move its industry. And what miraculously happened around this time? A country with a billion people, along with infrastructure (developed under Mao), suddenly opened up.\n\n&gt;Isn't it paradoxical that private capital should be helping socialism?\n\n&gt;Not at all. It is, indeed, an irrefutable economic fact. Since this is a small-peasant country with transport in an extreme state of dislocation, a country emerging from war and blockade under the political guidance of the proletariat\u2014which controls the transport system and large-scale industry\u2014it inevitably follows, first, that at the present moment local exchange acquires first-class significance, and, second, that there is a possibility of assisting socialism by means of private capitalism (not to speak of state capitalism).\n\n* Lenin, \"The Tax In Kind\"\n\nCapitalism is a robot. It is not sentient. It relies on bourgeois states to act as its handler, to muzzle it, to keep it on a leash - states who are (for the most part), vested with a modicum of sentience and an ability to restrain it in order to ensure its longevity. \n\nThis is why the CPC's unique developmental strategy has succeeded, where many others have failed.\n\n***\n\n**Capitalist China as the saviour of neoliberal ideology**\n\nThe idea that the PRC is capitalist, and that its successes are entirely the product of market capitalism, is a crutch of neoliberal ideology. Policy-makers in developing countries look at the PRC and they see a country which lifts 13.9 million people out of poverty every year, a country which bounced back from being ripped to shreds by European colonialism into being the industrial power-house of the world. They see the fastest growing economy in history. Neoliberal economy-doctors explain this success by prescribing developing countries more markets and more opening up. \n\nThis has the opposite effect. It plunges countries into poverty, forces 3w countries to become the unwilling debt-slaves of the World Bank, turns their governments into US-NATO puppets, and opens them up to being looted and pilfered by Western corporations.\n\nAs long as neoliberal economists can keep selling the insidious myth that the PRC is capitalist, the same thing will happen again and again. Periphery countries don't understand that the only way for a periphery country, in the modern imperialist system, to make headway in development - is either making socialism or being indulgently doted upon by the USA with subsidies and lucrative contracts under threat of the socialist alternative (South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan).\n\nThis is why the idea that the PRC is capitalist is important to people who preach the doctrine of modern capitalism. \n\nThere is no way to paper over the successes of the PRC. Everything you see has a \"Made in China\" tag on it. China is a place you can get a plane ticket and fly to. You can see that wages for Chinese workers have been increasing by 11% yearly, you can see that China is on course to reach parity with Italy's current GDP per capita by the mid-2030s, with a few Google searches. The idea that China could be socialist is intolerable to liberals, because it's a living example of why socialism works, and why it works a hundred times better than capitalism.\n\n***\n\nE: I've written about this before, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/communism/comments/73lp6q/xi_jinping_tells_communist_party_to_keep/dnsizvu/) is a longer and more in-depth explanation.","created_utc":1510812921,"score":22,"subreddit":"communism"}

Yet while I can see the sense in joint ventures, foreign investment, and bringing back expelled white commercial farmers for their expertise, access to capital, and to lessen aggression from the West, such a path has risks of its own. Of course, similar policies were pursued by both the Soviet Union (NEP) and China (the early 1950s when the CPC relied on former KMT professionals to help run society), so it is not certain that such a course of action would turn out badly; though I think it isn't saying too much to say that such a policy has risks.\n\nUltimately, I hope that whatever path the party chooses to follow, it remains committed to indigenization and industrialization, that those points remain the ultimate goals.","created_utc":1510815639,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

I understand the dynamic of state owned industry as opposed to the neoliberal project of total privatization, but at some point these industries have to be turned over to workers. Do you think such an endeavor is in the making?\n\nThis is what the PRC has already. All of the industrial giants and a good 40% of the economy is managed in precisely this way (SOEs - state-owned enterprises). The mass line is conducted, the results of the \n[thousands of policy experiments from around the country](https://www.quora.com/Where-do-I-find-good-examples-of-the-use-of-controlled-experiments-for-policy-making-in-China-and-elsewhere) come in, people give their two cents and raise their problems and concerns, overarching objectives emerge (\"reduce greenhouse gas emissions\", \"emphasize domestic consumption\" etc), then once there's a general idea about what things the CPC wants to do, the local governments send in their stats, enterprises send in their stats, government workers do the hard job of working everything out in spreadsheets and charts, the plan goes through the first revision and people are asked to comment on it, then the second revision, then the third, the fourth, the fifth, and so on - and then, at the end of it, you have a fairly comprehensive economic plan which can be fine-tuned as necessary as it passes down from the nation-wide level to provinces to cities and then to individual enterprises.\n\nAnother 10% of the economy are TVEs (township and village enterprises) which are managed by local governments which are directly elected, and they also have to pay attention to the economic plan (the shi san wu, as the most recent one is called), but they have a lot more flexibility about that kind of thing. They're mostly just policy instruments of the local governments, so if the SOEs are the economic giants, these are the smaller companies who dart around their ankles and get the small things done.\n\nOf course, SOEs can own other companies, and those companies can own companies and sometimes you have to go through four sets of owners before you see who *really* owns a company. Luckily for SOEs, four out of five of the largest Chinese banks are also state-owned, and they tend to be very nice about handing out billions of yuan to finance SOEs when they want to buy out private companies. Unluckily for people who want to analyse how much of the economy the PRC directly controls, not much of this is transparent. It's fairly likely another 10-20% of the economy is indirectly administered like this, but the CPC is beginning to mandate transparency for this kind of thing so we'll have more concrete statistics in a few years time.\n\nLikewise, private companies are required to have CPC trade unionists within their managerial structure and board of directors, in addition to party committees inside the firm. Over the past ten years, companies have been presented with demands to give the party committees more and more power, recently it's been expanded to legal guarantees to give the Party committees final say over all company decisions in the area. I'm on mobile rn, I'll link an article which talks about this. \n\nE: I see what you mean now - the CPC has given 2049 as the date for advancing to a more traditional planned economy and 2021 as the date that that transition begins. In official jargon it's \"advanced stage socialism\" - which is the aim of this whole thing - versus \"primary stage socialism\" which the CPC has identifies China as being in. The two phases are differentiated by how developed the productive forces are. \n","created_utc":1510819179,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"ksan","body":"It's worrying that a lot of people are replicating the train of thought that dominated the USSR since, say, the late 60s or so. There were people (surely with good intentions) defending more or less what you are saying about China but about the USSR literally a few years before it totally collapsed. Even including the good old \"we just need a couple more decades of development and then it's the higher phase of communism folks\". That should be a pretty big red flag, especially considering how developed China is already (the comparisons with Russia in the NEP time are honestly baffling).\n\nIn any case: the point of the socialist project is much deeper than economic development and \"catching up\" with Western economies, as important as that may be for a previously \"underdeveloped\" country. The fact that China is not exactly like the imperialist neoliberal hell that we know does not automatically make it \"socialist\", and the tenacity to reduce absolutely everything to an either/or mentality might be useful in agitation but cannot replace actual analysis. China has surely found a way to develop quickly thanks to its socialist foundation and its full integration into the world capitalist economy. In this way it has broken the failures of pretty much all other \"national-popular\" governments (this is Amin's jargon), and its specificity must be studied seriously. But for every economic indicator you give you could as easily provide counter-arguments against its socialist character: literal golden palaces for communist cadres, a quickly expanding number of billionaires, brutal working conditions, suicides, massive strikes, a growing international presence that is not as predatory as the Western one but that also isn't selfless internationalism, a huge dependence on the ups and downs of the international market. The list is very long, and that kind of debate is rarely useful because that's not how you do science; we need the right worldview that is able to make sense of the reality as a whole, not an amalgamation of isolated data points that refer vaguely to concepts that are used for their shock character more than for substance.\n\nAlso, of course, if China today is fully socialist then you have a difficult puzzle to solve, because what exists today was literally born out of a coup, a big purge in the Party, intense fight and struggle in major cities and the condemnation (with time in jail) of many close collaborators of Mao. It's also an almost word-by-word realization of everything Mao said would happen if the \"capitalist roaders\" took over the Party. Of course you could say Mao was terribly wrong and the true communists were Deng and the others, and some do, but that position is also not without its problems.\n\nFor whatever reason it has become fashionable in this sub to defend China in a way that is almost as strange as it was its condemnation some years ago. I think the debate could be healthy and the arguments have a little bit more of substance than the general ultraleftism that is so prevalent. I just worry that there is basically very little engagement with serious Marxist theory, and that people will be massively disappointed in the near-future if they put all their hopes in \"socialist China\", just as it happened with the USSR.\n\nEDIT: and FWIW, I think it's perfectly reasonable to say that given our experience with the collapse of the socialist block in the 90s countries like China should be defended as relatively progressive given the situation we live in. That's fine to say and maybe a sensible position for Western communists. What I think is counter-productive is to confuse this point with the historical tasks of communists and socialist construction, which remain as urgent as ever both for us and for everyone else, including in my opinion the Chinese people.","created_utc":1510828468,"score":20,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"new_guy36","body":"Sorry, was comparing the standard system of Capitalist art (I made something pretty, pay me) to the new system (here's just enough to get you hooked so you give me more money).\n\nIf you're defining coercion as the use of force then you're diminishing its meaning a lot. But lets stick with wealth extraction, because I think this is where you're the furthest off base.\n\nFirst, let us look at MACRO wealth extraction. This is when, through tools such as the World Development Bank, corporatocracy, and globalisation wealth is removed from one economy into the ownership of the elite. A good example is traditional British colonialism, but can also be seen post-world war II by the US neo-imperial system of bankruptcy-based dependancy and forced reliance via petro-dollar exchange. There is the underpinning of violence, even in these neo-imperial exchanges (e.g. the House of Saud were basically told to accept or..well...look what happened to Iran).\n\nNow let's look at micro-wealth extraction. This is done WITHIN a bourgeoisie state to increase income disparity and concentrate wealth within the capitalist elite, and to ensure class mobility is minimised. This is done extremely cleverly through, not the threat of force, but the threat of ostracisation. Adverts imply you won't be as good, happy, or successful without their actually meaningless product. Prices are raised artifically to give the implication of value where none exists. Social media 'celebrities' pretend to have a perfect life thanks to these amazing products you simply MUST buy today. This system is heavily reliant on psychology. People are being manipulated out of their wealth. Just because a con man doesn't have a gun to your head doesn't mean he's not extracting wealth.\n\nThis system is a version of the latter. They are using addictive methods that are particularly susceptible on children on a game marketed for children, inside a child-friendly franchise, with an age rating of 13. They are telling them [\"all your friends have Darth Vader, why don't you? Are you poor?\"](https://i.imgur.com/5lKYfh6.gifv).\n\nThe argument that \"people need to take responsibility\" is, sorry gonna be blunt, an extremely effective scapegoat of the capitalist class in cases like this. The same manipulation is being used on their parents. \"Do you WANT your child to be bullied? You're a bad parent. Joe's mum did, why can't you be like Joe's mum?\"\n\nThis is a far more complex system then you're making out to be, which undermines the threat of constant-marketing, status culture, and extremely complex psychological warfare being waged on the masses.\n\nEDIT: Also, in terms of parents not realising they need credit card controls on a game they played $70 is, I'd say, a form of knowledge class-ism and potentially ageism that gives an unfair burden of knowledge on the individual, as opposed to the massive organisation looking to maximise wealth received from an individual.","created_utc":1510864623,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

There was a thousand things I wanted as a kid but couldn't afford. So I borrowed my friends parents lawnmower and cut people's lawns in the neighborhood for $2. Eventually I bought my own lawnmower, and finally a piece of crap car and put that lawnmower in the trunk and drove to other neighborhoods to cut lawns. I don't see that work ethic in kids anymore. Now days every one wants to blame all their problems on rich people and expect to be given everything for free. Now people complain their life is horrible because some TV ad is \"forcing\" them to buy a product or a video game costs more money to unlock extra features.

Zimbabwe has an opportunity to set itself on a new path \u2013 one that must include democratic elections and respect for human rights. Ultimately, the people of Zimbabwe must choose their government. In our conversations today, we have an opportunity to discuss concrete ways that we could help them through this transition...This administration seeks to refocus our economic relationship squarely on trade and investment \u2013 to encourage policies that increase openness and competition within Africa...We are particularly grateful for the work of African countries to expand multinational and regional cooperation to counter terrorism...I announced that the United States pledged up to an additional $60 million in funding to support the G-5 Sahel Joint Force in counterterrorism efforts, and to bolster our regional partners in their fight to provide security and stability. The United States, as the largest peacekeeping capacity-building contributor, is also helping over 20 African countries train, deploy, and sustain peacekeepers...We appreciate the statements condemning the DPRK missile launches that many of your governments have made. But all nations must act to implement UN sanctions in full and cut off all UN-proscribed ties. Further, I urge you to take additional measures to pressure the DPRK by downgrading your diplomatic relationships with the regime, severing economic ties, expelling all DPRK laborers, and reducing North Korea\u2019s presence in your country in all other ways it may be found. The DPRK presents a threat to all of our nations. Everyone \u2013 including each country represented here today \u2013 must play a part in this peaceful pressure campaign to convince the DPRK that the only way to achieve true security and respect from the international community is to abandon its current path and choose a meaningful dialogue about a different future.\n\nReading this, its even worse than my title lets on.

He was specially concerned in making a deep study of the method of dialectical materialism. In 1922, in the article \"Meaning of Militant Materialism,\" Lenin said that it was up to the contributors to the periodical \"Under the Banner of Marxism \" to organise the work for a systematic study of Hegel's dialectics from the materialist point of view. **He believed that without a serious philosophical basis it is impossible to hold out in the struggle against the pressure of bourgeois ideas and the restoration of bourgeois philosophy.** (emphasis mine, Commissar-Crunch) It was on the basis of his own experience that Lenin wrote about the manner of studying Hegel's dialectics from the materialist point of view. We give here the corresponding paragraph from Lenin's article \"On the Meaning of Militant Materialism.\"\n\n&gt;&gt;But in order to avoid reacting to such a phenomenon unintelligently, we must understand that no natural science, no materialism whatever, can hold out in the struggle against the onslaught of bourgeois ideas and the restoration of bourgeois philosophy without a solid philosophical basis. In order, to give aid to this struggle and help to carry it out to its successful conclusion, the natural scientist must be a modern Materialist--a conscious adherent of that Materialism which Marx-represents that is, he must be a\u00a0*dialectical*\u00a0Materialist. To achieve this the staff of\u00a0*Under the Banner of Marxism*\u00a0must organise a systematic study of Hegelian dialectics from the Materialist point of view, i.e., the dialectics which Marx applied concretely in his\u00a0*Capital*\u00a0and used in his historical and political works. . . .","created_utc":1510962089,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Ophiusa","body":"Another very interesting interview from her, she is widely hated by the unapologetic way she described at the time what is not much more obvious. Some highlights:\n\n&gt;Obviously, we were unable to convince people and make them conscious of the actual social progress we made compared with a capitalist society dependent on exploitation, oppression and war. So many in the GDR believed they could join together the glittering world of commodities under capitalism and the social security of socialism. But, as Erich Honecker said in various speeches, capitalism and socialism are as hard to unite as fire and water\n\n(...)\n\n&gt;In this way they found the lever they had been looking for since the beginning of the existence of the GDR, that of their declared intention to \u201cliberate\u201d the citizens in the East. Regarding this, we should remember: The Western powers have \u2014 working in conjunction with German capital and its pliant politicians \u2014 first split Germany and then baptized the German Federal Republic. That contradicted the sense of the provisions of international law making up the Potsdam Agreement of the four victorious powers in 1945, which required a unified democratic Germany.\n\n(...)\n\n&gt;Let me remind you that the socialist GDR was a guarantee of peace in Europe. It never sent its sons and daughters to war. The Federal Republic of Germany, however, participates in bloody wars that the U.S. and NATO instigate throughout the world. French Socialist Jean Jaur\u00e8s (1859-1914\u2013JW) underlined this connection: \u201cCapitalism carries war within itself like the clouds carry rain.\u201d \n\n(...)\n\n&gt;After 1990, border guards were put on trial, although they had acted according to the law of the GDR. Even the leaders were tried and imprisoned, including party and state officials who had suffered years in Nazi penitentiaries and concentration camps because they had fought fascism. They were sentenced by FRG justice, which had never removed the fascists from its ranks.\n\n(...)\n\n&gt;I not only consider myself one \u2014 I am a communist. Loyalty is probably not the appropriate term.  Marxism-Leninism is an ideology, a method of investigation to understand the world, the laws according to which it moves, so you can orient yourself in the world. Some believe in a divine will, others in a predetermined fate. We communists are materialists. We follow a scientific outlook, which assumes that the society and everything that arises in it are the work of human beings. Exploitation and oppression are neither divinely ordained, nor are these evils acceptable.

Saying that muguabe is anti-white is like saying that the proletariat is anti-bourgeoisie. To imply that this is \"bad\" is an incredibly dangerous and counterrevolutionary line.\n\nThe people of zimbabwe were in a situation of colonialism, and particularly that of settler colonialism. The settler colony has a coloniser identity and a colonised identity. One of the primary results of this form of colonialism is the fact that the settler colony acts in a colonial manner, and that to maintain the role of the coloniser it will nationally oppress the colonised.\n\nTo reject the the \"racist anti-whiteness\" of Zimbabwe is to reject the struggle of national liberation. What you see as \"ethnic\" nationalism is just plain old nationalism. You have fallen for the trap that the coloniser uses in justification of its relationship to the colonised. It moves the conversation from national oppression to racial oppression and turns it into an ideological struggle instead of a material one. This trap results in viewing national liberation as racial liberation, and views oppression of the colonisers as racist oppression.\n\n2nd comment:\n\nNational liberation is not inherently anti-socialist. It is in fact inherently anti-socialist to reject national liberation as it requires the rejection of analysis of the material conditions under which people are subjected to.\n\nPlease read this basic [Marxism and the National Question](http://www.marx2mao.com/Stalin/MNQ12.html) by J.V. Stalin\n\n\n[Please additionally read this](https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-1/h&amp;amp;srym2.htm) as it provides helpful insight on other views of national oppression in regards to colonialism.\n\nI will not entertain your equating of nazi colonialism to that of the struggles of anti-colonialism.

{"author":"FIELDSLAVE","body":"What transformed the political landscape beyond recognition was the outbreak of what Rosa Luxemburg would have called a \u201cmass strike upsurge,\u201d a phenomenon she had witnessed and analyzed at the time of the 1905 revolution in Russia and the accompanying wave of mass strikes. Out of the blue, starting in Detroit auto plants in spring 1933, you got a series of ever larger and more encompassing strikes, mobilizing ever broader groups of workers on the shop floor and the streets \u2014 organized and unorganized, employed and unemployed, in an ascending wave. Programmatic demands and ideas that seemed pie in the sky were now, with the increase in workers power, plausible and actionable.\n\nThe strikes soon spread to the Southern textile mills, the Eastern coal mines, and the Midwestern steel mills. But Roosevelt stood aside and did nothing as the companies and the local repressive forces crushed one strike after another.\n\nThe miracle year for the workers movement was 1934. Workers fought and won three great urban general strikes: San Francisco (led by longshore workers), Minneapolis (led by teamsters), and Toledo (led by auto parts workers). In these struggles, as well as a series of others that shook cities across the nation, union organizers built their power by reaching out to workers in other industries, mobilizing the citizenry to support their picket lines, allying with unemployed councils, and engaging in pitched battles with the police.\n\nThe resulting shift in the balance of power and in political consciousness set the stage for the rise of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), the ascension of the Democrats to the country\u2019s dominant political party, and the passage of the New Deal reforms.\n\nIn November 1934, the Democrats achieved a crushing landslide victory in the midterm congressional elections, increasing the electoral majority they had achieved in 1932. Democrats at the radical end of the political spectrum were elected in disproportionate number, and even a few socialists came to office. Newly active workers entered into urban politics and joined up with the Democrats.\n\nEqually important, the smashing victories in the 1934 strikes endowed the nascent radical-led labor movement with the confidence and capacity to organize the United Auto Workers (UAW) and the CIO over the next three years. Roosevelt was transformed from a standard politician into a reformer, the carrot and stick of the new labor movement inducing the administration to advocate a series of historic sociopolitical reforms that included the Social Security Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act (which set maximum hours and minimum wages for most workers), and the Wagner Act (which extended union recognition and set up routinized collective bargaining).\n\nhttps://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/03/brenner-interview-sunkara-social-democratic-reformism-new-deal-fdr\n\n\n","created_utc":1511168500,"score":29,"subreddit":"communism"}

There are business owners whose business get busy enough that they hire people in order to better serve the customers. If, at the end of the day, the boss pockets the profit all for themselves, merely because they were essentially there first, that is exploitation of labor.  On the other hand, if the boss takes the profit and shares it among the workers, that then becomes closer to a co-op.  \n\nHow I saw the role of the comrade 'boss' vs. the bourgeois 'boss' explained once (again, I could be way off): take what the boss ***actually*** does, day in and day out, that directly contributes to the business, and hire someone new to do it or delegate all the tasks to a worker co-op.  Don't call them a CEO, don't call them a manager.  They make phone calls to support logistics, so what? A worker led co-op could do that.  They consult with technical experts on how to direct the company, so what? A worker led co-op could do that. Etc... now compare the salaries of the new person, or even the entire co-op board, to that of the CEO (or owner, or boss, or whatever).  What is the ratio? If it looks like what's going on in corporate America right now, that's wage theft, that's capitalism.  \n\nPaying people less for the 'privilege' of working in your business is bullocks, the business would go under if not for the workers.","created_utc":1511210798,"score":11,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"_Order_Sol_","body":"Kind of. A lot of the time the only truly expensive part of owning a business is the initial investment on the franchise and the building. The rest is pocket change of the profits depending on the store. For example opening a McDonald's the biggest expense is owning a part of the franchise and the 2nd biggest is construction of the building. Obviously construction cost can be higher depending on the area but a lot of the time it's less than the franchise.\n\nEverything else however is easily covered by hiring workers for cheap. Hiring clean up staff and custodians (make it part time at minimum wage) will allow you to have your building clean and efficient. Or you can have it a requirement for workers not doing something at the moment to take up the mop and clean as part of their job. \n\nNot to mention for example with McDonald's the profit gained will make the cost of everything else null. Your workers might sell 10,000$ a day. Of which you only have to give them $72 each day (based on an 8 hour work day paying $9 an hour) and a weekly paycheck to them of about $504 minus the taxes (for working 7 days a week no overtime) which the taxes should cover their insurance.\n\nSo by the end of the week assuming you only have 12 employees (5 for morning to afternoon and 5 for evening to night shift and 2 for midnight shift) you would only be paying $6,048 minus the taxes. And assuming they sold around $10,000 worth of food each day of the week you make $70,000. Of which you subtract the $6,048 for the week leaving you at $63,952 for the week. Monthly payments on property happen after you multiply this number by 4. Every month you make $255,808. Property tax is very much dependent on the area but most places it won't be much more than $5,000 to $8,000 for the parking space too. If we go by highest at the end of the month you are left with $247,808. At the end of the year you made $2,973,696 dollars. Buying a franchise costs $750,000 dollars and construction usually costs an extra $200,000 at the minimum. The most it will cost you however to have the franchise and construction done should be about $2.3 Million depending on any landscaping and the location. So by average at the end of the year you already made more profit than the initial investment. Including the initial employees and going off the max property tax. You made a profit of $600,000 and next year since you don't have the construction or franchise costs that all goes right into your pocket. By average every person you employ will only be earning before taxes $2,016 and after taxes it will usually be cut down to about $1,200 - $1,400. A year they make $16,800.\n\nThis is a huge profit loss for the worker because if the 12 employees split the money earned and the cost between each of them they would all make around $250,000 a year on average which means they can easily pay back the amount invested and easily cover the supplies and maintenance and everything and afterwards they can only profit. $8,000 between 12 people is $666~ and is way easier to pay when you are making $5,833 a week. All the owner here does after the initial cost bump is sit there and earn profits. They later hire mamagers and assistant managers to be the ones moving the merchandise and buy the food and hire and fire workers as needed. They pay the taxes and the insurance but making $2.9 to $3.2 million a year makes these costs null. All the things he did originally can be done by the workers if they work together and they can gain much more profit than working for someone who hands them $17,000 a year which is usually not enough to live in most places in the US.","created_utc":1511211057,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"MrSkullgrinder","body":"I would like to begin with a quote by Joseph Stalin.\n\n&gt; \"Officers and men of the Red Army! We are entering the country of the enemy. The remaining population in the liberated areas, regardless of whether they\u2019re German, Czech, or Polish, should not be subjected to violence. The perpetrators will be punished according to the laws of war. In the liberated territories, sexual relations with females are not allowed. Perpetrators of violence and rape will be shot.\u201d - J.V. Stalin, Order of the Day, January 19, 1945.\n\nThat is a direct quote from Stalin which you can easily find. But of course it is even easier to find western propaganda.\n\nAnother quote from the book Browder &amp; Kerensky, 1961.\n\n&gt; However, four months later, on July 12th of 1917, the death penalty was restored for all military crimes, murder, rape, and offences against the state committed during war time (Browder &amp; Kerensky, 1961). This measure was adopted by the Provisional government as a result of the deteriorating political and economic situation in Russia due to its unsuccessful participation in WWI and associated civil disturbances\n\nAfter the war Soviet officers began mass executing thousands of their own soldiers. The reason? War rape. Almost all Russian WW2 historians support this. One such example is Oleg Rzheshevky.\n\n&gt; According to Oleg Rzheshevsky, a President of the Russian Association of World War II Historians, 4,148 Red Army officers and many soldiers were convicted of atrocities and punished with capital punishment, while only 69 U.S. soldiers were executed. \n \nAnd\n\n&gt; Makhmut Gareev states that he had not even heard about sexual violence. He says that \"instances of cruelty, including sexual, occurred\", and that they \"simply could not be absent after what the Nazis did\" in the USSR, but also states that \"such cases were strongly suppressed and punished,\" and that \"they did not become widespread.\" He notes that the Soviet military leadership signed an executive order on 19 January 1945 that demanded the prevention of cruel treatment of the local population.\n\nNow this [article](http://www.trud.ru/article/21-07-2005/90824_nasilie_nad_faktami/print/) is perfect for what you are looking for. (Google translate works better than expected.) And will be the primary source I will be quoting. (Although I will also be posting the name of books I am quoting in brackets.) That is also the source for the Oleg Rzheshevsky comment. \n\nThe myth that Stalin and other high ranking officials at the time ordered the mass rape of civilians of any nation is not only entirely wrong but also had 2 primary origins and one secondary. The two primary origins were Anthony Bivor and goebbels. Goebbels began the myth that the red army was so ruthless and ravenous that they would rape any woman aged 10-70. \n\n&gt; \"In all villages and cities, all German women aged 10 to 70 were subjected to countless rapes. the behavior of a Soviet soldier can be seen as an explicit system.\"\n\nThis was where the rape of millions myth began. His evidence for the rapes themselves began with him using one unidentified rape as a way to mobilize civilians to rise against the, and I quote, \"Russian Mongol savages.\" Sadly I no longer have a source for that last part. (as the link I used to use no longer works) Also notice the statement of \"The behavior of the Soviet soldiers can be seen as an explicit system.\" Direct propaganda.\n\nAnthony took this a step further.\n\n&gt; However, Bivor surpassed Goebbels. Without any documentary evidence or at least non-anonymous testimony, he states: \"According to the estimates of the two main Berlin hospitals, the number of raped Soviet soldiers ranges from 95 to 130 thousand people.\"One doctor concluded that only in Berlin some 100,000 women were raped ... Apparently, much more if you take into account the 1 million 400 thousand raped in East Prussia, Pomerania and Silesia. It seems that about two million German women were raped.\"\n\nWith no evidence he claimed two million people were raped. TWO MILLION... He is the primary source for all western historians... To give you an idea of their validity. He is basically the big black book of Communism but for the Red army.\n\nNow the secondary source is the book and individual who started the myth that Stalin told his soldiers to start raping. The book and individual in question are, \"Conversations with Stalin\" by Milovan Djilas. The book was what first stated that Stalin and other officials ordered the rape of civilians. (The book itself being as factual as the black book)\n\n Now to give you an idea of how trustworthy Milovan is, he hated and slandered Stalin any chance he got. He felt that khrushchev was a far smarter, cunning, intelligent, and capable leader. And also has a book praising Gorbachev to the point of claiming he was not only a great leader, but he did the right thing. So yea... Not exactly credible.\n\nWith all that in mind we can come to a few conclusions. \n\n1. Stalin and the high ranking officials were not only against ANY form of harm against the civilians, but also ordered the execution of any soldiers who would commit such acts. I mean consider how big Stalin and the Soviet government were on women's rights? Do you honestly think they would allow or order the rape of women and children? No.\n\n2. The numbers were not in the millions, or even hundred thousands, but we're definitely in the tens of thousands. Most likely far less than a hundred thousand. \n\n3. Almost all of the sources that western historians based their findings on cannot be trusted. And have histories of attempting to slander the red army and Soviet Union. Attempting to make them look like savages. I mean, just look at all the propaganda against the Red army. They supposedly mass raped everything that moved, fought without weapons, shot deserters, only fought because they would be shot, constantly committed war crimes and atrocities, were undisciplined, only won because of lend lease, (even though they only used about 10% of it) and won by just throwing soldiers at the enemy until they overwhelmed them.... Right all sounds believable. So no none of it is trustworthy. Also note how the Red army was supposedly ravenous savages while amerkian soldiers woo German woman with just chocolate. This is no accident. (There is a large amount of evidence of mass rape by U$ soldiers)\n\n4. The rapists got what they deserved and were shot by the thousands.\n\n\nNow do not mistake what I am saying as justification or defence of the rapists in the Red army. Or denial that any rapes even happened. No they were monsters and deserved to be shot and the rapes definitely did happen. But it was only a few thousand soldiers committing these acts and the majority were shot. And every last one of them deserved a bullet, to be hung, some probably even torture. And the majority got it. So please do not mistake this as apologia. (I had someone accuse me of it once hence this whole paragraph.)\n\nNow as a little bonus I will give you a prime example of the trustworthiness and hypocrisy of western historians.\n\nThe mass rape of Japanese civilians by amerikan soldiers. This will be the [article](http://uncensoredhistory.blogspot.com/2012/10/rape-abuse-japanese-women-american-soldiers.html?m=1) I am referencing.\nThe article itself is well sourced. Although it also spews propaganda about the Soviet union (taking a centrist perspective) it is still a great article.\n\nNow shortly after the occupation of Japan mass rape by U$ soldiers was so rampant that after 10 days they stopped keeping count. (and began to cover it up, which can be read in the article I linked) In fact,\n\n&gt; There were also 1,336 reported rapes during the first 10 days of the occupation of Kanagawa prefecture after the Japanese surrender. \n\nJust one prefecture in 10 days. Yet the western historian numbers for the entire country (when they are actually willing to admit rape happened) is never higher than ten thousand. Although they frequently deny that any rapes happened. (Unlike the Soviet and Russian historians that admit that some of their soldiers did commit these acts.) Even though it is well documented with actual credible resources. On top of that the U$ actually did sanction the rape of civilians (also in the article I linked) in both allowing the rape of them, and working with the emperor to have forced comfort women ready for the U$ soldiers (also in the article). Also only 3 individuals were ever tried for rape, all 3 were black. (As opposed to the 4000-5000 Soviet soldiers who were tried and executed.)  They also silenced any Japanese civilians who attempted to oppose their crimes and made it illegal to write newspapers or comment against their occupation or the bombs until 1954 (hence why the original Gojira film came out that year)\n\nThere is more but this is already a wall of text so I will stop for now. But you should also look into the rape of Germany by U$ soldiers. The amerikans worked hard to try and cover up their crimes and worked with the former Nazis to make the Red army out to be savages while their own soldiers were heroes. Their soldiers likely also raped by the tens of thousands.\n\n I hope this helped comrade and was what you were looking for. Also sorry for the wall of text. And I am not sure about the NKVD committing atrocities (that sounds like western propaganda.) But then again, I do not know as much about the subject. Still though, I would be suspicious of such claims.\n\nWell that was super depressing to write about so I am probably going to lie down for awhile.\n\nI will finish this with one final significant quote. \n\n&gt; This war was started against us not by the German people, not by German workers, peasants, and intelligentsia, who's suffering we all understand, but by the gang of bloodthirsty fascist rulers of Germany, who have enslaved French, Czechs, Poles, Serbs, Norwegians, Belgians, Danes, Dutch, Greeks, and other peoples.

The coloni were obliged to work the land of their master, the large landowner, to make him a definite money payment or hand over a considerable share of the harvest, and to fulfil various types of duty. Nevertheless, the coloni had more interest in their labour than the slaves, since they had their own holdings.\n&gt;\n&gt;Thus there arose new productive relations which achieved full development in the feudal period.\n\nActually the section from the [previous chapter](https://www.marxists.org/subject/economy/authors/pe/pe-ch02.htm) titled \"Sharpening of the Contradictions of the Slave-Owning Mode of Production\" is probably the best place to start. Really I've found the whole textbook to be a good resource. It's worth noting the book is from 1954 so I'm sure later anthropological/historical studies refine the analyses. Particularly I started reading *Passages from Antiquity to Feudalism* by Perry Anderson, which proves with newer evidence that \"slave society\" deserves scrutiny. Does \"slave society\" classify as a *mode of production*? Anderson poses this question but the answer is outside of the scope of the book.

The concept refers to a strategy that breaks up existing power structures, and especially prevents smaller power groups from linking up, causing rivalries and fomenting discord among the people.\n\nTraiano Boccalini cites \"divide et impera\" in La bilancia politica as a common principle in politics. The use of this technique is meant to empower the sovereign to control subjects, populations, or factions of different interests, who collectively might be able to oppose his rule.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/communism/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1511346797,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Is this true? Not according to the CPUSA, they have never called for their members to cast their votes in *support* of the democrats, it has always been in *opposition* to the right extremists. \n\nThis is clear in their piece \"Defeating the right wing on the road to socialism\" http://www.cpusa.org/article/defeating-the-rightwing-on-the-road-to-socialism/\n\nIt appears that the long term goal of the CPUSA is the destruction of the republican party, and the introduction of the democrats as the right wing party, and itself as the left party of the US 2 party system. Gathered from this sentence: \"None of this is to suggest that the Democrats aren\u2019t now or won\u2019t be in the future an obstacle to progressive change; in too many instances they are, but they aren\u2019t the main obstacle for the moment.\"\n\nMany members within the CPUSA often cite [this piece](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1920/lwc/ch07.htm) as the motivation for voting against the right extremists. Many members also use[ this piece](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1907/jan/20.htm), to defend their current actions with the intention of running candidates again in the future, specifically, \"When a socialist really believes in a Black-Hundred danger and is sincerely combating it\u2014he votes for the liberals without any bargaining, and does not break off negotiations if two seats instead of three are offered him. For instance, it may happen that at a second ballot in Europe a Black-Hundred danger arises when the liberal obtains, say, 8,000 votes, the Black-Hundred representative or reactionary, 10,000, and the socialist 3,000. If a socialist believes that the Black-Hundred danger is a real danger to the working class, he will vote for the liberal. We have no second ballot in Russia, but we may get a situation   analogous to a second ballot in the second stage of the elections. If out of 174 electors, say, 86 are of the Black Hundreds, 84 Cadets and 4 socialists, the socialists must cast their votes for the Cadet candidate, and so far not a single member of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party has questioned this.\"\n\nThe CPUSA has answered the question of democrat allegiance several times in their \"CPUSA Mailbag\" as well as beginning the process of [running independent candidates](http://www.cpusa.org/faq/does-the-cpusa-run-candidates-for-elected-office-what-is-the-history-of-the-cpusa-in-presidential-elections/) where locals have the support, and funding to do so \n\nThe CPUSA continues to praise the Russian [1917 revolution](http://www.peoplesworld.org/article/from-russia-with-love-lenins-letter-to-american-workers/), advocate for friendship and cooperation with the [Cuban people](http://www.cpusa.org/article/lets-help-cuba-recover-from-hurricane-irma/) and attend international communist meets to [give speeches](http://www.cpusa.org/article/cpusa-to-world-communist-meet-defeating-fascism-is-the-first-step/).\n\nGo to the CPUSA website, read some articles, and go to their accompanying paper outlet people's world, and read their articles too.

Nothing threatens liberals more than someone to the left of them and nothing threatens \"post-colonial\" self-described Marxists than a real Marxist-Leninist who believes in truth and science. I hope spaces like this help you feel not alone and think about Marxism without having to tolerate liberals interjecting. \n\nI lived in another country for a long time and it was helpful for my life. You don't even have to live in the DPRK, America is uniquely terrible for all the things you highlight as one would expect in the heart of Empire and the true prison-house of nations. It's a toxic culture through and through. Helped make friends as well since everything is much clearer from the other side of the ocean. Easier said than done of course. \n\nAs for parties and politics, I fully admit I've been attracted to the PSL. There was a protest for peace in Korea, something which Korean comrades came all the way here from. While for us there was a small counter-protest across the street the protest itself wasn't too large, for Koreans it's no joke. Fascism is quite real there and the American occupation is literally in the middle of Seoul. Who was actually there to support the Koreans fighting in much more difficult circumstances? Not the liberals who call themselves radicals. Not even the \"anti-revisionist\" groups with such a large internet presence. Only the parties that care about imperialism without judgement and without imposing their own extreme identity-politics standards. And unlike trots who are there to shill for their own party, this was done out of solidarity. The Koreans were allowed to speak for themselves and real connections were formed, even over the language barrier. That's all I need and I think it should be enough for you without having to find the party that perfectly fits all of your beliefs like people constantly ask on this subreddit. Whether that sounds like fetishizing the 'authentic' third world lumpen I cannot say as I have not found that to be a problem among the communists I know and the parties I frequent but we come from different class backgrounds. It was surely a problem in the 70s and may be a problem among the remnants of the new left but new anti-imperialist and ML left is actually more disciplined than the past. I myself am amazed at the devotion and discipline many communists show, far more than my own petty-bourgeois laziness, but you won't find them in school or among liberals. But being around serious communists requires you to be serious as well and communism is a lifetime commitment with no easy success. That alone should be enough to dissuade you from any thoughts of giving up, all those people you hate won't even think of themselves as leftists in 5 years, why should they be the ones to interrupt your life commitment to communism?","created_utc":1511460584,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

We had a Korean landlord, Korean cable, and shopping at Korean stores only (unless we wanted to lug groceries 1/2 miles and then through a subway and bus to get home.) it was hard at first but we grew to love it. Now that we're home, we're working on our degree so we can easily go back there and work in the private sector. While over there we only had Korean tv with subtitles. There were a lot of jokes at NK expense and it was basically a universal eye roll. I was there when NK seriously threatened the major airport in Seoul. I lived 15/20 miles away and we actually went to a beach near the airport the next day. While everyone was a little shaken by the threats, it wasn't treated too seriously. it was nothing compared to when the ferry accident of school kids happened.

{"author":"ismayj","body":"Tldr: I think you are right that the only hope is for a republic to emerge but the revolutionary potential there will take a long time to develop because of the relative weakness of the Saudi bourgeoisie and the Saudi proletariat.\n\n\nBunch of random thoughts:\n\nThere does appear to be a contradiction between neoliberalism and the Saudi workfare/welfare theocratic state. It is probably inevitable that the House of Saud will fall, but what will emerge?\n\nIs there any revolutionary potential amongst the workers in Saudi Arabia?\n\nI took this from wikipedia because it is concise and conforms with my understanding of Saudi Arabia as essentially a poorly functioning welfare/workfare state for Saudi nationals:\n\n&gt;As of 2008, roughly two thirds of workers employed in Saudi Arabia were foreigners, and in the private sector approximately 90%.\u00a0In January 2014, the Saudi government claimed it had lowered the 90% rate, doubling the number of Saudi citizens working in the private sector employment to 1.5 million. (This compares to 10 million foreign expatriates working in the kingdom.)\n\n&gt;According to Reuters, economists \"estimate only 30\u201340 percent of working-age Saudis hold jobs or actively seek work,\" although the official unemployment rate is only around 12 percent. Most Saudis with jobs are employed by the government, but the International Monetary Fund has warned the government cannot support such a large wage bill in the long term.\u00a0The government has announced a succession of plans since 2000 to deal with the imbalance by \"Saudizing\" the economy, However, the foreign workforce and unemployment among Saudis has continued to grow.\n\nI would think that a revolutionary path for Saudi Arabia would be much more difficult than even for another petroleum heavy economy like Venezuela.\n\nIsn't it likely that the result of political upheaval there would preserve the economic base, giving formal political power to a new republic but one that would be completely subordinate to the bourgeoisie of the imperialist powers?\n\nThis is because given that Saudi national bourgeoisie is weak by comparison a Saudi republic would answer to comprador bourgeoisie.\n\nSaudi Arabia is already forming [closer economic ties with China](http://www.arabnews.com/node/1150331/saudi-arabia), so the US interest there is primarily as a military proxy and an importer of US weaponry. China buys Saudi oil and the Saudis use the money to buy US weapons.\n\nAssuming a bourgeois republic emerges, perhaps the welfare state will be dismantled and a service economy will begin to take its place. This may proletarianize Saudi workers but it appears likely that at first they will demand for the reinstatement of a welfare state through social democracy. At that point the role of international communist community should be to argue for social revolution and for socialism as opposed to social democracy. But in the mean time the economic base will have remained.\n\n","created_utc":1511567924,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"ogsarticuno","body":"Kind of a shitty sketch of an argument that is only kinda what you are asking.  TLDR: It has so far been a failure...but that failure comes about not because of properties inherent to communism but because of pre-existing external conditions external to communism (if flower is placed in poop and does not grow, does not mean flowers are failures / cannot grow..just means dont plant in poop need to plant in dirt)\n\nAt a sort of high level you need to start by defining what would make communism a failure or sucess.  This is hard to do but I will just assume that \"communism wins\" is equivalent to \"there exists a classless society in which people basically can do what they want as long as they dont fuck over others (classical liberal democracy) and in which everyone has the basic means to do this (food, shelter, medicine, also just like general money to spend on whatever u like) are freely provided to all individuals in a sustainable way that doesn't make use of wage slavery / labor exploitation.  \nNow you need to decide what conditions would need to be satisfied in order for a society to be able to do those things / develop to that state .  Main ones are\n\n Technological: Can technology ever be invented that will allow for communist states to satisfy their objectives? (it is impossible to imagine that any pre-modern (agrarian, feudal) society could ever manage to reliably supply their population with food/medicine/warmth/happiness even with some amount of forced labor / slavery because they simply lack the technology necessary to do so, and so until that technology exists, any attempted communist society will necessarily fail) \n\nAdversarial: Communism will probably have to emerge in an adversarial environment because its goals are likely to put it into conflict with the ruling class / dominant capitalist nation states / societies. Can communism emerge in these situations (IDK, I think in the modern era this is true...but I am pessmistic about postmodern era where like extreme surveillance allows for super preemptive response).\n\nMaterial (kinda making this one up myself): (will we have like..enough plutonium to power our machines once we get the technology) (eh probably)\n\nAt this point, you need to argue that, given our current condition, these conditions can be satisfied or reached, i.e. that yes we can develop technology that will allow for communism, we will have the means to power it and supply ourselves with food / home, and that this communist society can emerge / take possession of these technologies (means of production) from the current state we are in, at some point in the future. If you do that, you will be proving the claim \"communism can in principle be attained given our current state, and that past failures of communism are simply indicative of the fact that our society has not progressed far enough to reliably implement communism yet / the conditions aren't ripe\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_stage_of_socialism\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_materialism","created_utc":1511595799,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

It's better for it to be communist, hands down.\n\nIt's ironic critics bring up \"communism kills\" because that's the WHOLE POINT (of socialism).  Lenin humbled us to realize there will always be an imperfect state that will kill/oppress innocent people.  This makes liberals scared to take action.  Not communists.  Refusing perfectionism to instead be effective is truly loving the people.\n\nIf you want to know why anarchy is a ludicrous proposition beyond all reason, I would study Hobbes (or just wiki).\n\nThe \"authoritarian\" movement you refer to is actually just anti-revisionism.  It's not about idolizing Stalin or Mao.  It's about refusing social democracy.\n\nAnti-revisionism led to ultra-leftism, like the people who say Stalin did nothing wrong.  ML/MLM is against ulta-leftism as an adventurist fantasy.  Step by step mass building is how this works.  No one is perfect, and neither is anyone's ideas.

Elections themselves are prone to dictators, so perhaps in the future a party will augment votes with demarchy principals (Wiki). \n\n But for now we NEED democratic centralism or we turn into revisionists.

The eventual line from the worldwide congress to purge social democrats appears to have been correct and was advocated by Bordiga seven years before Stalin adopted it.\n\n&gt;I wrote it in an article as early as 1921: \u2018Fascists and social-democrats are but two aspects of tomorrow\u2019s single enemy.\u2019\n\nOn the anti-fascist bloc:\n\n&gt;We steadfastly maintained that the real enemy and foremost danger was not Fascism, much less Mussolini the man, but rather the anti-fascism that Fascism \u2013 with all of its crimes and infamies \u2013 would have created. This anti-fascism would breathe life into that great poisonous monster, a great bloc comprising every form of capitalist exploitation, along with all of its beneficiaries: from the great plutocrats down to the laughable ranks of the half-bourgeois, intellectuals and the laity.\n\n&gt;I already explained above, in my answer to the 14th question, that the Aventine Secession was a total capitulation to bourgeois and capitalist reaction. It justified our easy historical prediction \u2013 cited above \u2013 the the most sinister effect of the Fascist phenomenon would be the rise of the anti-fascist bloc, whose ambiguous politics was to become dominant and smother the future of our hapless Italian society, as we witness today.\n\nFrom a current US context, this may shed light on why \"the resistance\" is so amorphous and ineffectual.","created_utc":1511607475,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

As for his opinion of fascism, there's a reason Gramsci was in jail and he was not. That he came up with a position earlier than Stalin is not a virtue since conditions in 1921 and 1928 were not the same. This is basically the same reason the united front in China was probably wrong in 1924 and definitely correct in 1939. Whether the united front was correct or not is a discussion worth having (and was had, as I implied it was an essential question for the Chinese) but it has to be rooted in material analysis.

Why try to argue that Bordiga wasn't a Marxist? Maybe his analysis was wrong, I'm not saying it wasn't. Gramsci thought that to create a bloc was the correct path at the time. One of Bordiga's points here is how a bloc can lose its way precisely by having its slogans liberalized and a minority communist faction having its analyses be lost in an undifferentiated muddle if it doesn't make a point clearly delineate its program from those of idealist parties. I think that often the so called anti-fascist resistance we see today takes the form of liberalism and diverts some of the energy of communists. Maybe this isn't as much of a problem as I think and it's a separate question of whether it is tactically right to pursue a popular front strategy, but even in a popular front I feel there is no point in communists carrying the banner of liberal anti-fascism. A popular front requires the agreement of the social democrats and not merely the assimilation of communists, as I'm sure Gramsci would agree.","created_utc":1511628387,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

Unlike the united front which requires making certain issues secondary for political unity, anti-fascists go to protests, beat people up and get beaten up, and go home. There's no permanence to it and it would happen whether organized or not.

{"author":"mitzadom","body":"I believe it was Luk\u00e1cs in one of his lesser (in terms of quality) works who introduced the term to mainstream Marxism. The fact that it has become synonymous with the name Marx is quite unfortunate and probably more a result of bourgeois academia looking for easy ways to explain Marxism than anything else.\n\nI looked up the one usage by Engels but it clearly isn't a scientific category that was explored on its own right but more of a way of explaining materialism versus idealism.\n\n[Here's the the extract](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1893/letters/93_07_14.htm)\n\n&gt;Ideology is a process accomplished by the so-called thinker consciously, indeed, but with a false consciousness. The real motives impelling him remain unknown to him, otherwise it would not be an ideological process at all. Hence he imagines false or apparent motives. Because it is a process of thought he derives both its form and its content from pure thought, either his own or that of his predecessors. He works with mere thought material which he accepts without examination as the product of thought, he does not investigate further for a more remote process independent of thought; indeed its origin seems obvious to him, because as all action is produced through the medium of thought it also appears to him to be ultimately based upon thought. The ideologist who deals with history (history is here simply meant to comprise all the spheres \u2013 political, juridical, philosophical, theological \u2013 belonging to society and not only to nature), the ideologist dealing with history then, possesses in every sphere of science material which has formed itself independently out of the thought of previous generations and has gone through an independent series of developments in the brains of these successive generations. True, external facts belonging to its own or other spheres may have exercised a co-determining influence on this development, but the tacit pre-supposition is that these facts themselves are also only the fruits of a process of thought, and so we still remain within that realm of pure thought which has successfully digested the hardest facts.\n\n&gt;It is above all this appearance of an independent history of state constitutions, of systems of law, of ideological conceptions in every separate domain, which dazzles most people. If Luther and Calvin \u201covercome\u201d the official Catholic religion, or Hegel \u201covercomes\u201d Fichte and Kant, or if the constitutional Montesquieu is indirectly \u201covercome\u201d by Rousseau with his \u201cSocial Contract,\u201d each of these events remains within the sphere of theology, philosophy or political science, represents a stage in the history of these particular spheres of thought and never passes outside the sphere of thought. And since the bourgeois illusion of the eternity and the finality of capitalist production has been added as well, even the victory of the physiocrats and Adam Smith over the mercantilists is accounted as a sheer victory of thought; not as the reflection in thought of changed economic facts but as the finally achieved correct understanding of actual conditions subsisting always and everywhere \u2013 in fact if Richard Coeur-de-Lion and Philip Augustus had introduced free trade instead of getting mixed up in the crusades we should have been spared five hundred years of misery and stupidity.\n\n&gt;Hanging together with this too is the fatuous notion of the ideologists that because we deny an independent historical development to the various ideological spheres which play a part in history we also deny them any effect upon history. The basis of this is the common undialectical conception of cause and effect as rigidly opposite poles, the total disregarding of interaction; these gentlemen often almost deliberately forget that once an historic element has been brought into the world by other elements, ultimately by economic facts, it also reacts in its turn and may react on its environment and even on its own causes.","created_utc":1511669440,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

What the western leftist sees is orientation against imperialism which is unacceptable. \n\nThis becomes more evident when you see what *is* acceptable to the western leftist.

This latest farce by the western leftists is truly grating, with even amerikkkan patriots posing as \"maoists\" supporting the USA occupation of Syria. \n\nAgain, the details of such and such movements in the global south does not actually concern the western leftist.

This is from Leading Lighthouse Communism\n\nI don't claim to speak for the LLCO (apparently the original founder is out of jail now and has a new website called [Army of the Leading Light](https://thefounders.co/)), but I believe the line of reasoning goes something like this:\n\nTo have a revolution, you need a social-base. That is, you need a significant pool of potential recruits to actually draw from. So in a country of 10 million, you would need a significant percentage of these people to actually be recruitable to your movement, say 5 million or so. Of the 5 million, only a tiny fraction will ever join your organization, and an even smaller fraction will be willing to commit violent acts toward revolution. However, a large chunk of this 5 million would be sympathetic toward you goals, and would support you in power, and potentially aid you in minor ways during revolution. The quote from Mao about fish and water would be relevant here.\n\nIf this is not the case, then you can only recruit what LLCO often refers to as \"anomalies.\" To them, you're an \"anomaly\" if you have any interest in their politics at all if you're living in the first world. You still might be able to recruit these people to do revolutionary activity of some sort, but there is no chance for social-revolution, because what you are attempting to do goes against the objective economic interests of the population. That is, it is in the objective economic interests of the majority of the population of the first-world to continue the extraction of surplus value from the third-world. Thus, most of the first-world population is actually an enemy to be combated, not people suffering from false consciousness who need to be convinced our ideas are correct.","created_utc":1511747200,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

Houghton Mifflin, 1971. p.373-378. Although Hitler\u2019s rep has required critics to always badrap his book, it\u2019s an exhilarating rip-roaring rant that easily roars past most left political writers. It is overly long, but so is the much duller Das Kapital.

German army officers hostile to the new Weimar Republic trained and funded the early Nazi Party. The Taliban was backed by Pakistani and Afghan mafia capitalists hostile to global corporatization, and by a Pakistani general who later broke with the CIA and began denouncing Western imperialism.\n\n&gt;But Sakai and Hamerquist agree that fascists in power follow their own agenda -- not the agenda of big business. As Sakai argues, German capitalists profited under Hitler. But there is no evidence that they told the Nazis to\ninvade the Soviet Union, ally with Japan and thereby bring the United States into the war, or put scarce resources into exterminating the Jews -- all decisions that contributed to Germany's military defeat. \n\nWhat?","created_utc":1511922452,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

I wanted to be wrong, and I hoped I was wrong. Alas, it seems that my instincts were correct.\n\nMugabe was not perfect, and he did not do everything that I would have liked him to do. From 1980 when he took power until about 1997 or so, he pursued an opportunistic and foolhardy policy of reconciliation with the white settlers, and a policy of balanced budgets, free trade, and other assorted garbage favored by the IMF and the World Bank. Then in the late 1990s, he told the World Bank and the IMF to take a hike, and seemed to remember that he had once been a Marxist-Leninist. The land reform followed. I don't care what the bourgeois media say, the redistribution of land from 4,000 white settlers to 300,000 landless indigenous families was a fundamentally good thing. The policies of indigenization of Zimbabwe's mining sector and of industrialization were also good. Although not socialist per se, they would have put Zimbabwe's vast mineral resources under the control of Zimbabweans, and would have tended to increase Zimbabwe's economic independence.\n\nI had hoped that Mnangagwa, who had previously supported all of these things and who was a veteran of the liberation struggle, would continue these policies.

Whilst I understand that there are stark differences between China, its populations and a traditional first world country, surely the fact they are bringing up things that are undeniable such as the rise of landlords and the fact they are bringing up things such as gentrification, corruption and ethnic issues which can be seen by simply googling, does that not show that even though they may be white collar liberals, they are hitting points which are in fact of concern to us? Obviously everything is much deeper than a Reddit post or a google search, but it seems to me that many frustrations we feel of capitalism are echoed in the PRC. \n\nEdit: okay it seems clear people are not actually going to discuss anything here and this response is getting some support. However I do not think that the questions of things like institutional and social issues and deviations from Marxism can be answered by dismissing people, who watch things happen every day because they actually live there, as simply being armchair racists or detached from the situation. I am neither on the poverty line nor in the more deprived areas in my country yet I still see and understand such issues in my country because I live here. \n\nMany people here are MLM, so consider this, a mass line and revolution is formed from frustrations across classes, the most poverty ridden to the middle class. When a middle class man says gentrification and treatment is a problem in Beijing, you can bet the classes facing such issues hate actually being in that situation too, regardless of the fact the person telling us may be a white collar Brit.

The Left misconception that it is useless to read fascist writings (\"The Ethnostate\", \"Turner Diaries\", etc.) in order to gain an insight into Fascism is pretty dangerous imho. Sakai doesn't read Fascism to become a Fascist but in order to fight Fascism. And if you read those writings Sakai's conclusions actually make a lot more sense. And yeah Capital is a little dull compared to Hitler's rants because much of it is hardcore political economy. Doesn't mean they both aren't worth reading (since Sakai implies he's read and wants people to read both). It's just that the Left recommends people read a lot \"harder\" texts all the time so there's no excuse not to investigate Fascist writings. Mao always reminded people to read bourgeois texts in order to know their thoughts and how to critique them. I don't see how this is any different.\n\nI also don't think we should offhandedly dismiss a revolutionary who was a vital part of prisoner support for the BLA, has been through more campaigns (including sneaking into f.b.i. offices, occupying buildings etc.) than nearly everyone here based on a couple of comments on the role of Fascism.

{"author":"TheGhostiest","body":"China is complex. Always has been. As a Communist, this is my take on it.\n\nAfter Mao left power, the government essentially developed a policy of de-Stalinization, much like the Soviet Union did, except with their own leader Mao and his policies.\n\nThey essentially wanted to distance themselves away from all of the problems of Maoism, such as the failures of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.\n\nIn doing so, they relaxed most Communist policies and opened up the nation to Capitalist exploitation. Again similarly to the Soviet Union.\n\nI think that, perhaps, they believed that they would experiment and see if Capitalism was going to work better, and if so then they would dissolve the PRC exactly like the Soviet Union was dissolved.\n\nHowever, very, very recently it seems they have realized that all of this was a huge mistake. That Capitalist exploitation has caused massive pollution in both their cities and their water sources and made extremely unhealthy living conditions for their people everywhere. Not to mention finding obvious corruption and exploitation from renters, land developers, and other \"entrepreneurs\". Then there is also the problem of their extremely wealthy elite whom have gained so much wealth they gained influence in the government and links of corruption have been discovered. Not to mention them having one of the highest income inequalities in the world.\n\nThe list of explicitly Capitalist problems has built up a very long list, and most of these things have only been recently analyzed. But this analysis has been linking directly to these relaxed policies, demonstrating a new insight into their government process.\n\nI think Global Warming also has had a huge effect on their government. The profound concept that Capitalism has essentially ruined or is currently ruining the Earth and may become uninhabitable for most people. They seem to be taking this very seriously, considering that they deeply understand the environmental concerns that have created in their own cities.\n\nThis new knowledge has led their government to create new stricter and harsher reforms against these Capitalist sectors and they have also brought, or are currently bringing, many of these wealthy Capitalists to trial for their corruption, manipulation, and destruction of the environment.\n\nThe result is a newly reformed government that has seen that Capitalism is not the solution to their problems, yet a government still unsure how to bring about Communism, and possibly even unsure of the safety of doing so due to historical issues regarding Mao and Stalin as well as the worldwide propaganda against the ideology itself. \n\nMostly it seems they want to avoid putting themselves into a situation similar to NK and Cuba, and especially prevent a second Cold War era.\n\nThey are, perhaps, overly aware of their own struggles, to the point that it seems they have mostly ignored the problems for a long time due to simply being paralyzed with fear in how to overcome them.\nYet they have now timidly decided small steps are a good direction to take for now.\n\nI personally disagree with their process, and I think they need to tackle these problems with the fearlessness of our great leaders, Mao, Stalin, and etc. However, this is my current analysis of their history, policies, and processes. \n\nHowever, I'm but a Western Communist \"outsider\" myself, so I can't give you the intimate, day-to-day insight into their country that you seem to want.

{"author":"shroombuddha8","body":"While I've read both the article and \"Settlers\", that was some time ago so the arguments that led Sakai to these, in my view, false and harmful conclusions are not fresh in my mind. I have no problem with re-reading the article, but unfortunately I get a database error when trying to access it at the moment.\n\nAnyway, let's look at that quote again\n\n&gt;Despite its genuine hostility to big business, Sakai argues, fascism often receives support from the small and local bourgeoisie and from sections of the capitalist state. German army officers hostile to the new Weimar Republic trained and funded the early Nazi Party. The Taliban was backed by Pakistani and Afghan mafia capitalists hostile to global corporatization, and by a Pakistani general who later broke with the CIA and began denouncing Western imperialism.\n\n&gt;But Sakai and Hamerquist agree that fascists in power follow their own agenda -- not the agenda of big business. As Sakai argues, German capitalists profited under Hitler. But there is no evidence that they told the Nazis to invade the Soviet Union, ally with Japan and thereby bring the United States into the war, or put scarce resources into exterminating the Jews -- all decisions that contributed to Germany's military defeat.\n\nThe fascists say they are hostile \"big business\" and Sakai agrees, according to the review. The fascists say that they are against imperialism and Sakai agrees, according to the review. Nevermind that the assertion that the Nazis and other fascists were or are hostile towards the big bourgeoisie, or imperialism, is plainly ridiculous and contrary to both history and the marxist-leninist analysis of fascism. His conclusion, again based on the review, also implies that fascism is not a terroristic class dictatorship of capital, but bases itself on _something else_, presumably the petty-bourgeoisie and the labor aristocracy. It follows that, according to Sakai, there really seems to exist a \"Third Way\" (in addition to the class dictatorships of the proletariat or capital) just as the fascists claim. Odd. To top it off, Sakai just erases the big bourgeoisie's fundamental responsibility and complicity in the rise of fascism and its crimes. I don't quite see how any argument can make such a conclusion less suspect, to word it carefully.\nHonestly, I'm having a hard time believing a supposed communist would write something like this. Coupled with his footnote  on \"Mein Kampf\" this analysis is certainly giving _myself_ a long pause.\n\nNotice that his footnote doesn't say what you imply it says. It _praises_ \"Mein Kampf\", even advertises it, while calling \"Das Kapital\" \"dull\". I don't understand how a communist can feel that way about a great and foundational - not to forget well-written - (difficult, perhaps) book such as \"Das Kapital\", especially when creaming his pants about Hitler's concoction one sentence earlier.\n\nYou say communists should study key works of fascism. Then I would be interested in what exactly you learned from reading these works (which \"insights\" are to be found is fascist literature? Especially given that fascism is a notoriously incoherent ideology!), \"Mein Kampf\" in particular, that you can't learn from reading actual marxist-leninist analysis of the fascist phenomenon, especially given that most workers' time is actually quite limited and there's no end to actually insightful marxist literature.

{"author":"theredcebuano","body":"Yes, other capitalist countries and institutions have reduced debts. The IMF and World Bank have released the HIPC initiative to reduce or even relieve the debts of poor countries. There was the Jubillee 2000 that brought together some 40 countries calling for the cancellation of debt, and finance ministers of the G7 actually agreed on a debt relief. China cancelling debt is not new, nor is it for the sake of the poor countries. The reason why any capitalist country, even China, would cancel debt is because it is more strategic to do so - there are limits to the development and export of surplus capital to a country which is highly indebted. \n\n&gt;Don't you realize even ultras like you kind are few in the West compared to the huge numbers of capitalists/anarchists/\"social\" democrats and so on \n\nIt doesn't matter if those \"huge numbers of capitalists, anarchists and social democrats\" are all isolated within college campuses without any mass work. If you had any experience with the masses, you wouldn't be committing your Right deviationism. I only look like an ultraleft because you're so far doused with Right deviationism that the slightest revolutionary movement that calls for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie would be a \"\"Left\" error\" to you because \"there are progressive elements in that bourgeois institution.\" \n\nEver since the Deng Xiaoping clique took over, economic reforms have been introduced that brought back capitalism. The deregulation of state enterprises and autonomy is one of the bourgeois regression. This creates the illusion that China is still socialist because a good amount of their economy is controlled by the state sector, but further investigation and analysis would reveal that each state enterprise has control over itself, over its own capital and dispersal of wages, essentially acting as state owned private enterprises. \n\n&gt; Besides, state capitalism is truly a shitty concept\n\n\"In any case, with trusts or without, the official representative of capitalist society \u2014 the state \u2014 will ultimately have to undertake the direction of production. This necessity for conversion into State property is felt first in the great institutions for intercourse and communication \u2014 the post office, the telegraphs, the railways...\n\nBut, the transformation \u2014 either into joint-stock companies and trusts, or into State-ownership \u2014 does not do away with the capitalistic nature of the productive forces. In the joint-stock companies and trusts, this is obvious. And the modern State, again, is only the organization that bourgeois society takes on in order to support the external conditions of the capitalist mode of production against the encroachments as well of the workers as of individual capitalists. The modern state, no matter what its form, is essentially a capitalist machine \u2014 the state of the capitalists, the ideal personification of the total national capital.\"\n\n-Socialism: Utopian and Scientific, Friedrich Engels\n\n\"State capitalism would be a step forward as compared with the present state of affairs in our Soviet Republic. If in approximately six months\u2019 time state capitalism became established in our Republic, this would be a great success and a sure guarantee that within a year socialism will have gained a permanently firm hold and will have become invincible in this country...\n\nBut what does the word \u201ctransition\u201d mean? Does it not mean, as applied to an economy, that the present system contains elements, particles, fragments of both capitalism and socialism? Everyone will admit that it does. But not all who admit this take the trouble to consider what elements actually constitute the various socio-economic structures that exist in Russia at the present time. And this is the crux of the question.\n\nLet us enumerate these elements:\n\n(1)patriarchal, i.e., to a considerable extent natural, peasant farming;\n\n(2)small commodity production (this includcs the majority of those peasants who sell their grain);\n\n(3)private capitalism;\n\n(4)state capitalism;\n\n(5)socialism.\"\n\n-The Tax in Kind, Vladimir Lenin\n\nState capitalism is a transition stage from capitalism to socialism. Necessarily, the capitalist market will eventually bring about the existence of monopolies - private or public - which will aggravate the crisis of capitalism. Just because it is used against Stalin or Mao doesn't mean that it's shitty - it's a necessary concept that has to be studied. The NEP period of the Soviet Union and the Three Year Rehabilitation Period to the First Five Year Plan of China can be called as state capitalism. \n\nWhat makes state capitalism different from socialism? It may be useful to think of two forms of state capitalism - bourgeois state capitalism and proletarian state capitalism. Certainly one cannot think of Iran as anything other than bourgeois state capitalism. While a major part of their industrial sector is owned by the state, it should be noted that it is still the bourgeoisie that holds political power. The NEP period of the Soviet Union is a form of proletarian state capitalism because it was the proletariat that held political power and it directed the construction of socialism in the Stalin era. \n\nThere are red capitalists in China. And their dispersal does not make things okay. Just because they're starting to get purged (not for being bourgeois btw but for political reasons, crime, etc.) does not mean that the party will hold back to its proletariat bearings. We've learned in the history of the CPSU, even the old Communist Party of the Philippines and Mao-era CPC that purging capitalist roaders, left/right deviationists and the likes does not solve the problems that their influence put in the party. A rectification movement is needed to expose the errors and get the party back to its proletarian mass line. \n\n&gt; And mobilize thousands of people reeeally\n\nYou sound like you don't believe that. Here's some images to prove my point:\n\nMovement Against Tyranny rally in - \n\na. [Cebu](https://twitter.com/thefreemannews/status/910752409831354368)\n\nb.

[Mendiola](https://kodao.org/2017/09/21/anti-tyranny-rallies-gather-tens-of-thousands-across-the-country-and-abroad/)\n\nThat is just one rally. There are lots more that have happened, happening and are to happen. \n\n&gt; Of course, only yourselves are true Marxists we are all state capitalists/socio-imperialists/revisionist pigs\n\nWow, putting words in my mouth.

{"author":"dethkon","body":"As others have pointed out the necessity of imperialism and exploitation of the \"developing countries\" and third world, permit me to focus on the view of just the Nordic countries.\n\nSocial-Democracy is the least harsh form of capitalism on the worker, because it provides good, often excellent, social/public goods (schools, roads, housing, healthcare etc), a robust welfare state, and the nationalization of certain industries. \n\nUnfortunately, it still exploits the worker, because although the worker may be well paid compared to the neoliberal capitalist nations, the surplus value he creates does NOT return to him in full- he still only receives a fraction in the form of his wage, while the employer keeps the remainder as profit. \n\nAnyway, some people argue that social-democracy hurts socialism by essentially bribing the working class with false needs (and, tbf, some real needs), creating the false-consciousness in the proletariat that they are not being exploited, meaning they won't bring out the guillotine and start the revolution. (This is similar to Mao's theory of the \"labor aristocracy.\")\n\nFor example, when Social Democracy was introduced to America by President Roosevelt in a program called \"the New Deal,\" he specifically told the business community that it was meant to \"save capitalism from itself.\" Meaning \"if we don't do something, there will likely be a communist revolution in this country\" (this was during the great depression). \n\nI disagree with this. If there isn't a social safety net, that means that poor people have to work 2 or 3 jobs so that they and their family don't starve, which doesn't leave any time to learn about socialism or gain class consciousness. They know something is wrong, but without being exposed to the science of Marxism, they remain atomized from their fellow worker and unable to improve their wretched condition (this is why agit-prop is so important imo). \n\nAnyway, US Social Democracy was dismantled and replaced with neoliberalism during the 80s and 90s, with Bill Clinton putting the final nail in it with his \"Welfare Reform Act\" in 1994.\n\ntl;dr: Social Democracy is the best of the worst, but that isn't saying much.

You can read their contribution here:\n\nhttp://www.solidnet.org/china-communist-party-of-china/18-imcwp-contribution-of-cp-of-china-en\n\nthere's nothing too surprising in there and I'm sure many would find most of these parties to be revisionist. Regardless, what's interesting is that the KKE completely disagrees with the CCP and the idea of market 'reforms' being compatible with socialism. \n\nhttp://www.solidnet.org/greece-communist-party-of-greece/cp-of-greece-contribution-of-the-kke-at-the-19th-imcwp-en-ru-es-ars-in-leningrad\n\n&gt;Historical experience has demonstrated that the problems that arose in the course of socialist construction were mistakenly interpreted as inherent weaknesses of central planning. The solution was sought in the expansion of market, which was a step backwards, instead of making a step forward expanding and strengthening the communist relations of production.\n\nBut they have relations anyway. Picking your friends was easy when the USSR was leading world socialism (and was a point of unity for anti-revisionists as well), pragmatism may taste bad but it's probably necessary, at least for communists who face underdeveloped forces of production. An MRI machine is the same whether it comes from imperialist America, revisionist China, or revolutionary Cuba though the end goal is to end dependency for all nations in the future.\n\nI think there's no single solution. Of course the Communist Party of the Philippines isn't going to go, the PKP-1930 goes. And that's not just a matter of revisionism but one of survival as the latter party was legalized by the Marcos regime and attempted to push it left (i.e. collaborated) while the CPP was fighting people's war against the dictatorship. I think the CPP line on China itself is more ambiguous:\n\nhttps://josemariasison.org/the-communist-party-of-the-philippines-on-maoism-new-democratic-revolution-china-the-current-world/\n\n&gt;It is with respect to China\u2019s contention with more aggressive and plunderous imperialist powers that may be somehow helpful to revolutionary movements in an objective and indirect way. China is playing an outstanding role in the economic bloc BRICS and in the security organization Shanghai Cooperation Organization beyond US control.\n\nBecause revisionist China still exists, it didn't vanish from the Earth or become part of a global and amorphous 'capitalism.' To bring this back to China itself, I don't think the OP represents anything new compared to what they already called\n\n&gt;The Communist Party of China will lead the Chinese people to unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development and a win-win strategy of opening up. We will increase friendly exchanges with all countries, and work with the people of other countries to push forward the lofty cause of peace and development.\n\nand I don't think it's very important in understanding China today and the line communists should take within their particular historical circumstances. Despite all the bluster from the CCP this year, I don't think much of substance was actually said by the party or by Xi. The make-or-break moment, when China is sufficiently developed that 'developing the forces of production' is no longer an excuse, is still pretty far away for most of the 1.5 billion Chinese people. I'm willing to be called cynical here though, all it would take is a single revolution for the question of revisionism and a new center of world revolution to be back on the agenda.","created_utc":1512074940,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

If you want something concrete, how much does an ipod cost to make? How much does it sell for in Stockholm? That's your answer. This is necessarily true because capital has to be profitable and finds profits wherever it goes. Trump is right in this sense, business will flee if they are taxed too heavily to nations where they have lesser taxes, the coercive laws of competition demand it and remove any choice in the matter. The only way any kind of welfare is sustainable is if profits are coming from somewhere else, in this case imperialism. Used to be cheap raw materials, now it's commodities themselves.
