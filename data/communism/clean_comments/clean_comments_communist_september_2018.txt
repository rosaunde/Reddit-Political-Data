People have brugsret (use-right) for the property, but no one owns Christiania in the traditional sense of private property. I think officially the Christiania fond owns the area? I'm not sure.

This is why the place still has problems with police raids, as \"pusher street\" is the only remaining part of Christiania that the government really wants cleared.\n\nI'm not an expert on anything, so feel free to research yourself, or come by and visit, there's a tour you can take n shit","created_utc":1535825118,"score":16,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"Why can't socialism develop its own machinery (more accurately go from light to heavy industry) as the Soviet Union was able to? The idea that the NEP should continue beyond the destruction of the civil war is Bukharin's line and paints a very grim picture of what socialism is capable of. This kind of pragmatism has come out of the failure of attempts to delink from world imperialism and develop indigenous industry but you need to engage with the counter-arguments, which include Lenin's, Stalin's, Mao's, Che's, and many others. It is ultimately born of cynicism and a lack of continuity between the communist movements of the past and the atomized, alienated socialists who drift to the struggles of others (this is of course far better than living in a fantasy since it at least attempts to engage what's happening in the remaining socialist countries). Deng may use Mao opportunistically, but don't let that confuse you: they were bitter enemies through the entire post-war period. \n\nThe concrete counter-arguments is that one cannot \"use\" imperialism in this way because imperialism creates dependency and *underdevelopment.* Your post is all over the place on this question since you talk about the progressive role of the national bourgeoisie but then talk about collaborating with imperialism for capital intensive goods which undermines the nationalist bourgeoisie. Also, the basic question of all third world nations is land reform which your post doesn't really engage with, as Deng's represented the line against Mao's line on land reform and has largely implemented a de-communization of land. GDP growth, urbanization, advanced production in the third world, these don't really tell us anything as they are the end result of globalization rather than particular policies by nation states. In fact, the state with the highest GDP growth is Ethiopia (let's exclude Libya which actually has the highest growth and should tell you what a joke GDP figures are). It too is experiencing the same phenomenon as in China: immense urban growth, foreign investment in \"high value\" production, growing inequality, rising GDP. These are not the result of socialism but the opposite: dismantling socialism, reversing even minimal land reform, opening to imperialist investment, and destroying indigenous industry to specialize in \"comparative advantage,\" in this case primary commodities and cheap labor. In fact it is trying to repeat the Chinese experience by undercutting Chinese wages: it has no minimum wage at all. \n\nI'm not saying you're wrong. But you're not right either. You're opportunistically using bourgeois arguments in favor of socialism without understanding that these figures are by capitalism and for capitalism: the entire point of socialist development is to grow industries which are *not profitable* by international standards and therefore do not reflect directly in GDP figures. Unfortunately, the level of debate on this issue is so low on both sides that neither is familiar with the history of debate going all the way back to Marx himself and his debates with Bakunin, Proudhon, Lassalle, and others (you may be surprised to learn that a major factor in the split in the first international was over the Irish question and these very same issues, of course Marx was correct about imperialism and anarchists since have basically been limited to first world chauvinism though few are even aware of the roots of their ideology). But at minimum, you should engage with Mao's responses to these exact issues against Deng.","created_utc":1535833267,"score":11,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"smokeuptheweed9","body":"I have to agree, the basic thrust makes no sense. After admitting that imperialism is getting stronger by dominating nation states rather than being dominated by them (something that never really happened but whatever), the author then says the opposite is happening: that imperialism is becoming more diversified globally and more states are rising to the level of imperialist powers. \n\n&gt;First of all, Triad capitalism is in decline, while new partners and competitors are emerging.\n\nHow can new partners and competitors emerge if imperialism is getting stronger? The basic tendency of capitalism is towards increasing inequality, hence monopoly capitalism. Therefore if the pie is getting smaller even in the \"triad\" countries, especially for the labor aristocracy, then the pie is getting even smaller for the rest of the world. \n\n&gt;new middle classes are emerging rapidly in the countries once assumed to be monolithically part of the Global South\n\nhow does this happen under imperialism? This is an extremely important theoretical question which is just assumed to be true. If imperialism, growing stronger, is capable of creating a larger middle class in the third world than ever before in history, imperialism doesn't seem all that bad. \n\nLuckily, this \"review\" is not related to the actual work in question, it is just a springboard off a better work to rant about China.

{"author":"China_comrade","body":"Hello!\n\nNot a bad comment. I live in China, and I also think it is a socialist country, though I try to be as clear as possible what I mean, and explain my reasons so an audience not versed in Marxist jargon can understand.\n\nMost people think socialism means something akin to 'heaven on Earth.' If you hang around on the socialist subs on Reddit, you will see people essentially debating the mere possibility of a fantasy world where there is no money existing. This is the *level* most people who espouse a socialist\/communist viewpoint are at, which is to say, a very low ideological level. For them, communism has essentially replaced the role of religion, heaven being replaced for the earthly heaven of socialism, which is denied to us by a capitalist Demiurge that rules the world.\n\nOf course, under this idea, China is not 'socialist.' This vision necessarily implies a utopia, of which China is not. However, you have hit on the more technical understanding of how we should evaluate China; is it a dictatorship of the proletariat (hereafter I will abbreviate to DotP).\n\nSome people say a DotP and socialism are two different things. You can have a DotP without socialism, but you can't have socialism with a DotP. Depending on how you look at this question, we should either be debating whether or not China is a DotP, or whether or not they have achieved socialism. Most of the anti-China crowd would deny that China is a DotP in the first place, but this *theoretical* distinction needs to be made, least people could fall into confusion about the political nature of the Chinese State.\n\nI would personally argue there isn't much difference at all between being a DotP and socialism, but many prefer to keep the distinction intact, largely I suspect so there remains a *fantasy* for some people to continue projecting on. In any case, I would argue that yes, China *is* socialist as well. I think this is more helpful to argue because the Chinese economy does not work according to the dictates of the market or individual capitalists, and in my opinion, this distinction is more important to make for people, than to continue catering to infantile fantasies about what socialism is for young people from the West.\n\nRegardless of whether or not the distinction between the DotP and socialism is made, it is in my opinion unquestionable that China is a DotP. I have often stressed one very important fact to emphasize this (and make no mistake, this argument is *potent* to a certain section of people who know the power of television in Western societies, particularly America); the television. Most foreigners here in China never watch the television; it serves as a reminder of their essentially alien nature in this society, a reminder they haven't really even tried integrating themselves, a reminder they haven't even bothered to learn the language enough to follow rudimentary conversations between Chinese people. They naturally avoid it, so most of the foreigners here miss the *massive* evidence staring them in the face that China is ruled by a communist party that takes *ideology* very seriously; the television.\n\nScroll through the State Owned television channels (all media is owned by the government here), and you can't help but notice military dramas devoted to the war era, documentaries about the revolution, people signing patriotic and communist era songs on live television akin to American Idol, etc, live coverage of large communist party events, etc, etc.\n\nSome people like to read Gramsci and talk about *ideological hegemony* when discussing anything and everything about Western society. I often think a lot of this is an attempt to slip back in the idea of 'False Consciousness' to explain the total failure of communists in the advanced capitalist countries, but curiously enough, people who like to talk about this stuff throw it all out the window when it comes to China. The dominance of capitalism and imperialism ideologically can conveniently explain away all failures of Western communists, but point toward the television in China as evidence of the DotP and they will likely laugh at you!\n\nOh, and don't forget the schools. English is basically a mandatory subject here in China, and getting into a good college requires doing well on the Gaokao, the national college entrance examination here. Without it, I am convinced most foreigners here wouldn't have a job. In any case, this puts most of us here in close contact with the school system. I have had two different jobs in public schools, and yes, just as the television is evidence of the ideological hegemony of the communists, so is the school system.\n\nI remember one time in my college activist career, getting into an argument with some person about the gang of four and Hua Guofeng. The particulars of the debate I can no longer recall, but eventually I had nothing to say to a particular point he made involving an obscure historical figure. This the person took as evidence he had bested me in an argument about the nature of socialism itself.\n\nWell, I can tell you this; young children in China learn these narratives better than any Western 'radicals'! All this because it is a natural part of their patriotic education, which often models the PLA in style. The school grounds of the public schools are riddled with communist symbols and slogans as well, and the children are generally much freer than anything I ever experienced in the American education system (they rarely even stand in lines!).\n\nI think the biggest disconnect between Westerners who imagine socialism as a fantasy, and substitute this fantasy for the reality of actually existing socialism, is that they imagine political parties are capable of making everyone do what they want them to. To them, that China is not a mirror image of their fantasy is evidence something is wrong with the party. When you interrogate this idea critically, you will find it depends on the idea of essentially unlimited ability to control people by political parties (Western or otherwise). This point of view is completely false. A political party isn't an omnipotent social engineer, capable of changing social-reality to suit its tastes. The *masses* can and do act independently of any political entities trying to *direct* them.\n\nNonetheless, if one asked oneself what a *genuine* communist party with political power would find itself doing in *any* country, the answer to that question will invariably look like what the Chinese Communist Party is doing in China.","created_utc":1535848971,"score":17,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"GenosseMarx","body":"A German citizen was stabbed in an altercation with migrants recently, he later died from his wounds. A prominent fascist with connections to the police got a hold of the police report and tweeted about it. Fascists made up a story about how the German was actually defending a fair German maiden from sex-crazed migrants (the police later denied this story but it is still making the rounds). Fascists instrumentalized this and organized a \"protest\" of all their different factions in the city of Chemnitz (where the crime happened).\n\nAbout 1000 fascists congregated and went through the city, chasing foreign looking people, attacking them and chasing them into traffic. Ironically the stabbed German citizen had Cuban roots and would have been among the people these fascists attacked. The next day about 8000 people kept protesting, particularly in front of the famous Karl Marx statue of the city (the city was called Karl-Marx-Stadt during GDR times). Now there was anti-fascist counter demonstrations, but comparatively few. The police let the fascists do their thing; they attacked and chased anti-fascists, broke protest laws by using weapons and masking themselves, made the Hitler salute, chanting Nazi slogans, etc.\n\nSince then (this was Sunday\/Monday) there have been attempts to seize the chance by fascists and hold more protests in other cities, nothing very successful. In Berlin there was a big anti-fascist demo with 10k people taking part. And yesterday both sides demonstrated again in Chemnitz, and again there were thousands of fascists who broke all kinds of laws (there's video of them attacking journalists, for example). This time there was greater police presence and it was primarily directed against the anti-fascists.\n\nNoteworthy about this is: 1) the amount of fascists that got together, 2) their violence, 3) their acceptance by the police, 4) normal citizens participated in the fascist demonstrations, 5) political outrage in the mainstream was minuscule compared to the G20 protests that were used to vilify the left for months and to prosecute them with utmost brutality, including the police breaking all kinds of laws and the press calling for special services to counter left elements.\n\nGermany is advancing towards fascism from both state level and from the masses (petite bourgeoisie, labor aristocracy and lumpen).","created_utc":1535874168,"score":47,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"HealthySwimmer","body":"30 years after the fall of the GDR there are still massive Wealth\/Income\/Opportunities differences between east and west Germany.  There were many east German citizens which lost their Job at reunification and have been unemployed since then(\\~2000 25% unemployment,). Also all of the anti communist promises of a better world under capitalism did not occur and many  young are still leaving the region for Berlin or the west.  \n\nAt the same time the German media is probably one of the most homogenous in the western world, neo liberal ideology is not questioned on any level. From this arose the national sentiment, especially in the west, that since the  delevopment did not occur as promissed, it was because the east were backward savages. Additionally in 2004 the social democratic party  (SPD) passed a \"labour reform\" which massively reduced unemployment benefits and manipulated the unemployment figures (e.g. 52yrs+ do not count). This basically meant that the structural economic problem was not  talked about constructively in any political arena. \n\nIn this environment fascist parties managed to gain a lot of direct support, but were also accepted by larger parts of the population. A more leftwing alternative (Die Linke) did also exist and is still strong, but very few (me included) believe any  great reforms can arise from their action.\n\nWith the start of the refugee's ariving in 2015 (\\~1mio), east Germany was the main area of opposition to it, but the hardcore fascists existed everywhere. However, unlike in the west, the average population seems to have fear of association with this extreme group, giving protests like Pegida 1000s of participants. The standard elite \"smuggnes\" is now to call all of saxony racist\/fascist which I think given the historical context is not helpful. Also we are ignoring the much wider problem that our \"liberal\" politicians are exacerbating the 1000s of refugees deaths in the mediterranean, declare Afganistan a save country and want to build camps to house all refugees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe incident itself was a stabbing in Chemnitz by two foreigners, but this does not really matter, it is only a catalyst. Suprising to most, the protest had 100s of people and also because of violent attacks against foreigners made the national news. Currently, the right wing is well organised in Germany, so the next day they organized protests around the country. The anti fascists response was not too good to be honest. In Chemnitz the anti refugee crowd (again to all fascists, but no fear of association) was in the clear majority. Berlin had big pro refugee demonstrations though.\n\nI was at an event in D\u00fcsseldorf (west), where it was about 200 fascists (real skin heads), against 250 Antifa, The right became really good at organizing on a short notice.\n\n&amp;#x200B;","created_utc":1535885127,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

To quote one [reviewer](https:\/\/roselynhsueh.com\/media\/files\/hsueh_review_ps_quarterly_summer_2013.pdf) of the book:\n\n&gt;The widely accepted narrative of China\u2019s reforms since 1978 reads as that of a communist party\u2010state embracing the market and enmeshing its economy within the global system. It is a compelling story of an autarkic Maoist regime starting cautiously by privatizing agriculture at the local level and opening a handful of special coastal zones to foreign investment before ultimately unabashedly embracing a booming nationwide market economy and absorbing more foreign direct investment than any other developing country.\n\n&gt;Roselyn Hsueh\u2019s careful research reveals why this plot line is not only unsatisfactory but also inaccurate. Delving beneath the outer macroeconomic layer, the author uncovers a cyclical pattern of central government policies in which waves of liberalization are followed by counter\u2010waves of \u201creregulation.\u201d Hsueh labels this dance the \u201cLiberalization Two\u2010Step, \u201dwhereby what the state deregulates with one hand at the macro level, it reregulates with the other hand at the micro level. According to Hsueh, China\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 did not significantly alter the situation, as Beijing has sought to give the appearance of complying with WTO commitments by loosening economy\u2010wide regulations while at the same time retaining \"selective controls at the sectoral level\"\n\nTo put it simply, you simply can't trust most Western scholarship on *anything* about communism, and how the economy of China functions is no different.","created_utc":1535893750,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"DryZebra","body":"I love the culture series. \n\n&gt;He could not believe the ordinary people in the Culture really wanted the war, no matter how they had voted.\u00a0\u00a0They had their communist Utopia.\u00a0\u00a0They were soft and pampered and indulged, and the Contact section's evangelical materialism provided their conscience-salving good works.\u00a0\u00a0What more could they want?\u00a0\u00a0The war had to be the Minds' idea; it was part of their clinical drive to clean up the galaxy, make it run on nice, efficient lines, without waste, injustice or suffering.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Culture is when you've got a powerful state that spreads Communism across the Galaxy by force if necessary, but usually preferring to interfere with elections, corrupt politicians, even straight up murder. Ian Banks, the author, basically advocates for \"socialism in one planet\" in his piece \"[A Few Notes on the Culture](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120322183158\/http:\/\/www.futurehi.net\/phlebas\/text\/cultnote.html)\"\n\n&gt;Concomitant with this is the argument that the nature of life in space - that vulnerability, as mentioned above - would mean that while ships and habitats might more easily become independent from each other and from their legally progenitative hegemonies, their crew - or inhabitants - would always be aware of their reliance on each other, and on the technology which allowed them to live in space. The theory here is that the property and social relations of long-term space-dwelling (especially over generations) would be of a fundamentally different type compared to the norm on a planet; the mutuality of dependence involved in an environment which is inherently hostile would necessitate an internal social coherence which would contrast with the external casualness typifying the relations between such ships\/habitats. Succinctly; socialism within, anarchy without. This broad result is - in the long run - independent of the initial social and economic conditions which give rise to it.\n\nIn the same piece he talks about the necessity of planned economics, how markets are crude and blind, even speaking basically directly to Marx's line \"after labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want\" when he says, \n\n&gt;The Culture, of course, has gone beyond even that, to an economy so much a part of society it is hardly worthy of a separate definition, and which is limited only by imagination, philosophy (and manners), and the idea of minimally wasteful elegance; a kind of galactic ecological awareness allied to a desire to create beauty and goodness.\n\nI just...

Generally it's the more backward capitalist countries in the \"Third World\" where religion is most influential, whereas in the more developed capitalist countries it has sharply decreased in influence. The poorer proletarians in the underdeveloped capitalist countries obviously have more of a need for religion than the relatively wealthier proletarians of the First World. That's why it's so striking that America seems to be the exception to this rule. Ofc in developed capitalist countries it hasn't disappeared completely, and won't until we get to socialism. I would also note that the decrease of religious observance in the West has not automatically led to people embracing dialectical materialism - all sorts of confused, petty-bourgeois ideas and coping mechanisms like post-modernism, nihilism, identity politics, drug abuse, gambling, video games, etc, have taken over the role that religion used to play. However, I think that these will be much easier to combat and that material reality will soon intervene and wean people away from these things, but not without intervention from the revolutionary party spreading Marxist ideas.","created_utc":1535915358,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

The basic tendency of capitalism is towards increasing inequality, hence monopoly capitalism. Therefore if the pie is getting smaller even in the \"triad\" countries, especially for the labor aristocracy, then the pie is getting even smaller for the rest of the world.\n\nDoes Bromma say that imperialism is stronger? that the pie is getting smaller? Butch Lee, Red Rover and Bromma all hint at a developing ultra-imperialism that somehow overcomes the national contradiction that Lenin said defined imperialism.  Just because imperialism adapts and transforms doesn't mean we are moving towards one global class structure. This type of centralization of one collaborating imperialist class is implied by Bromma. I'm not sure what basis the imperialists would have for competing if they separate from their national bases. Bromma even talks about the importance of China building their own national alliance in support of imperialism.\n\n&gt;     new middle classes are emerging rapidly in the countries once assumed to be monolithically part of the Global South\n&gt; \n&gt; how does this happen under imperialism? This is an extremely important theoretical question which is just assumed to be true. If imperialism, growing stronger, is capable of creating a larger middle class in the third world than ever before in history, imperialism doesn't seem all that bad.\n&gt; \n\nThere's 2 ways: the independent way and the imperialist client way. The Republic of Korea, a state created by the imperialists has long been upheld as an example to others in the periphery that you can turn your economy around (or that you should not try to kick imperialism out of your country or it will rip you in half). China on the other hand succeeded in kicking out the imperialists, giving themselves the space to develop their own economy under socialism, creating the basis for highly successful capitalist enterprises, accumulating capital, allowing for the development of \"middle classes\" similar to other imperialist countries.\n","created_utc":1535920506,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"WikiTextBot","body":"**German\u2013Soviet Axis talks**\n\nIn October and November 1940, German\u2013Soviet Axis talks occurred concerning the Soviet Union's potential entry as a fourth Axis Power in World War II. The negotiations, which occurred during the era of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, included a two-day Berlin conference between Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, Adolf Hitler and German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, followed by both countries trading written proposed agreements. After two days of negotiations from 12 to 14 November 1940, Germany presented the Soviets with a draft written Axis pact agreement defining the world spheres of influence of the four proposed Axis powers (Japan, Germany, Soviet Union, Italy). Hitler, Ribbentrop and Molotov tried to set German and Soviet spheres of influence; Hitler encouraged Molotov to look south to Iran and eventually India while preserving German access to Finland's resources, and to remove Soviet influence in the Balkans. Molotov remained firm, seeking to remove German troops from Finland and gain a warm water port in the Balkans.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/communism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1535967558,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

On the surface the numbers check out, but *GDP per capita does not calculate the distribution of wealth among citizens*.

And then you have those who will outright claim they are fabricated (this usually stems from a belief that liberal statistics are always right because they come from \"democracies\")\n\nYou may have more success in philosophical arguments without presenting them as Marxist.

{"author":"CriticalResist8","body":"I started making a bookmark folder full of commie shit (literally what I called it, I hope my computer is never seized by the police lol), so it's no trouble, I just copy-paste from there.\n\nThere are hundreds of arguments against communism -- or rather, people will find hundreds of arguments against communism, no matter how true they are. This is why a humble head will do more good than a passionate speech; it's all about conceding what you don't personally know (you can't be an expert on everything) while defending what you know is true. You can't be an expert on everything and usually people throw in claims they can't defend because it's just something they've heard all their life and, through repetition, started to believe. But at the same time, don't fall for revisionism: you don't have to concede to appease the person you're talking with.\n\nBut I think everyone, including right-wing economists (not all of them, but some of them) want everyone to prosper to a certain degree. The people I talk to are mostly scared of the unknown, not knowing if a communist society will end up crumbling and crushing them and their family. And believing in communism happens when you start reading theory and see for yourself that it was written by experts in their fields. Personally, I try to normalize socialism. It's nothing special: give the means of production to the workers and everything else flows from there. It's hardly going to kill us all.\n\nIf you're interested in philosophical counter-arguments to communism, they've actually all been around for more than a hundred years. Marx takes them on in the Manifesto and Gotha Programme I believe, and Kropotkin also debunks some claims in The Conquest of Bread. Nothing has changed since then.\n\nA final point:\n\n&gt; \"Well it would be nice but Communism wouldn't work economically at all.\" That's usually the argument most of my liberal friends make.\n\nWhile socialist countries enjoyed good standards of living (compared to capitalist countries of their category) and in some cases better democracy than what we know, they have also been assailed by imperialist powers (start here: https:\/\/github.com\/dessalines\/essays\/blob\/master\/us_atrocities.md). And getting liberals or the politically illiterate to recognize imperialism and how their country partakes in it is difficult. There is this component of primal tribalism that tells them \"we're the good guys, whatever we do is good\" and, well, the fact that imperialism doesn't fuck their lives up helps too.

{"author":"TheSutphin","body":"\u201cHere I am back again in the Treasury\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but with one great difference. In 1918 most people\u2019s only idea was to get back to pre-1914. No one today feels like that about 1939. That will make an enormous difference when we get down to it.\u201d John Maynard Keynes wrote this\u00a0in 1942.\u00a0It did make a difference. After the Great Depression and a second world war, people wanted change. They got it. France calls what followed\u00a0les trentes glorieuses.\n\nThe stagflation of the 1970s brought a counter-revolution: the 1980s saw a radical change of ideas on the role of the state and markets, the goals of macroeconomic policy and the job of central banks. Again, the aim was a fundamental transformation.\n\nSo what happened after\u00a0the global financial crisis? Have politicians and policymakers tried to get us back to the past or go into a different future? The answer is clear: it is the former.\n\nTo be fair, they have tried to go back to a better past. That is what happened in 1918. Then they had just come out of a devastating war. So the new ideas were about peace \u2014 \u201ccollective security\u201d and a League of Nations. But they wanted to return to the prewar economy, especially the gold standard. In 1918, then, they mostly wanted to go back to a better version of the past in international relations. After the crisis of 2008, they wanted to go back to a better version of the past in financial regulation. In both cases, all else was to stay the way it was.\n\nThe chief aim of post-crisis policymaking was rescue: stabilise the financial system and restore demand. This was delivered by putting sovereign balance sheets behind the collapsing financial system, cutting interest rates, allowing fiscal deficits to soar in the short run while limiting discretionary fiscal expansion, and introducing complex new financial regulations. This prevented economic collapse, unlike in the 1930s, and brought a (weak) recovery.\n\nNote how closely these actions hewed to the pre-crisis policy consensus. Central banks acted as lenders of last resort, as they should. They also played the dominant role in macroeconomic stabilisation, as pre-crisis thought suggested. Their principal instrument remained interest rates, though they included long rates this time, because short rates reached zero. Shortly after the worst of the crisis had passed, fiscal policy turned towards austerity. The financial system is much as before, albeit with somewhat lower leverage, higher liquidity requirements and tighter regulation. Efforts to lower debt in the private sector were modest. (See charts.)\n\nThe financial crisis was a devastating failure of the free market that followed a period of rising inequality within many countries. Yet, contrary to what happened in the 1970s, policymakers have barely questioned the relative roles of government and markets. Conventional wisdom still considers \u201cstructural reform\u201d largely synonymous with lower taxes and de-regulation of labour markets.\u00a0Concern is expressed over inequality, but little has actually been done. Policymakers have mostly failed to notice the dangerous dependence of demand on ever-rising debt.\u00a0Monopoly and\u00a0\u201czero-sum\u201d activities\u00a0are pervasive. Few question the value of the vast quantities of financial sector activity we continue to have, or recognise the risks of further big financial crises.\n\nIt is little wonder populists are so popular, given this inertia, not to mention the miserable experience of so many citizens since the crisis and, in important cases, before that. Politics abhors a vacuum. Ideas as dangerous and divisive as those of US president Donald Trump or Matteo Salvini, Italy\u2019s deputy prime minister, are bound to fill it. One cannot beat something with nothing.\n\nThe persistent fealty to so much of the pre-crisis conventional wisdom is astonishing. The failure of Keynesianism in the 1970s was significant but certainly no greater than the combination of slow economic growth with macroeconomic instability produced by the pre-crisis orthodoxy. What makes this even more shocking is that there is so little confidence that we could (or would) deal effectively with\u00a0another big recession, let alone yet another big crisis.\n\nWhat explains the complacency? One reason might be the absence of good ideas. The economist Nicholas Gruen argues just that in a\u00a0provocative article. Yet there are some perfectly good ones.\n\nSome have argued for a shift from\u00a0debt to equity finance\u00a0of house purchases. Others have called for the elimination of the tax deductibility of debt interest. Some note the perverse impact of\u00a0executive incentives. Some argue convincingly for\u00a0higher equity requirements on banks, rejecting the argument that this would halt growth. Others ask why only banks have accounts at\u00a0central banks. Why should every citizen not be able to do so? Some wonder why we cannot use central banks to escape dependence on\u00a0debt-fuelled growth.\n\nBeyond finance, it seems ever clearer that protection of intellectual property has gone too far. Also, why not shift taxation on to land? Why are we letting the taxation of capital collapse? And why are we not trying to revitalise antitrust?\n\nAn all-embracing new ideology may be unavailable today. That is probably a good thing. But good ideas do exist. A more likely cause of inertia is the power of vested interests. Today\u2019s rent-extracting economy, masquerading as a free market, is, after all, hugely rewarding to politically influential insiders.\n\nYet the centre\u2019s complacency invites extremist rage. If those who believe in the market economy and liberal democracy do not come up with superior policies, demagogues will sweep them away.\n\nA better version of the pre-2008 world will just not do. People do not want a better past; they want a better future.\n\n","created_utc":1536065147,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

In the third-world, the people\u2019s wars are done by the people themselves, and because the first-world has no revolutionary class, and the prospects of potential upbringing of a proletarian class won\u2019t mean much considering they will ultimately gravitate towards fascism, people\u2019s war will take a different stance in that it will be a global people\u2019s war \u2014 intertwined with the internal forces of oppressed semi-colonies \u2014 that will bring down enemy populations and imperialism as a whole in the first-world.\n\nAnd the fact that you say \u201cGonzaloites\u201d shows exactly where your interests lie \u2014 condemning revolution and revolutionaries. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you were one of those people who also call people \u201cMaoites\u201d because they actually want to make revolution, and dislike \u2014 and actively combat, revisionism.\n\nThe conditions for the Bolshevik Revolution and the current revolution in Peru are different. Mistakes were made in both. Anti-communist suppression was different in both. Revolution isn\u2019t just an act that wins easily, it is an on-going process that will involve retreats, setbacks, shortcomings, and advances. With the increase of Fujimorite propaganda and the funding and overall training of peasants by anti-communist forces, alongside internal failures and other events, of course the Peruvian revolution is in a momentary setback. But it is not dead, it will keep on going until victory. Mao taught against impatience, because it leads to opportunism and revisionism. Give the revolution the time it needs to win and delink it from your dogma.\n\nCommunists have long said to criticize and repudiate revisionism, and you clearly are showcasing your revisionism. While imperialism is definitely the present and foremost enemy, revisionism is also a foremost enemy that must be stamped out.\n\nYou call us dogmatic for resisting revisionism, but in reality, you\u2019re a dogmato-revisionist for adhering to the line of phony-socialism as present in the revisionist countries today, and for loathing revolutionary action that bases itself in the communism of the epoch.","created_utc":1536094853,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"corvibae","body":"I know exactly how you feel, comrade. I'm also disabled(fairly recently) and having mobility issues really limits me and it drives me nuts. When I was a much younger man, I always thought that at my current age I would be attending protests day and night. In all of that time I have attended one(1) event. I'm going to tell you the story of what happened that night because it's really important, and because a lot of socialists, even the ones who are kindest to disabled people, tend to forget about us sometimes. \n\nIt was the day after Heather Heyer was killed, in a small college town in North Texas. It was a warm day(it being Texas) but had been raining. I have a degenerative joint disease, and by the time my partner and I turned up to the vigil, it was quite wet outside. \n\nHumidity really does kinda fuck me up at times. It makes my already stiff joints even stiffer, more swollen. I also hadn't really planned to go to anything that night, but through my connections to North TX DSA I got added to a facebook group. Neither of us were really dressed for the occasion, and had just finished our dinner at an Olive Garden before got in her car and drove to the site. I dress rather distinctively, so I was able to let folks know where to look, but while we were there it was decided that a march of IWW\/ISO\/DSA comrades would be led from the nearby college campus to the grassy area where we were supposed to meet up. This kinda left my partner and me in the lurch, as you might imagine.\n\nIt had been a long day and was already about 7:30-8:00 in the evening, tomorrow or the next day I was supposed to be on a plane back to my Hometown for my final semester of graduate school. That said, we had already driven quite a distance to come here, and my partner wanted to see the town, so we walked around, went into a few shops and bars, bought some coffee. She could tell I was in pain, but I was ignoring it, and then at about 9:00 a post in the groupchat informed us to all gather at the originally appointed spot. \n\nI, cane in hand, limped over to the best of my ability. There were speakers from the IWW and DSA. We sang \"We will not be moved\" and \"This Land is Your Land\" I think, and were about to basically go through the little red songbook when I nearly fell down. My left knee, you see, doesn't like long periods of activity without rest, and my partner saw it, she helped me back to the car and we went home. \n\nMy point in telling this story is that you need to know your limits, your boundaries, and not to push them too hard. Mostly what I like doing is writing(as if you can't tell) and writing is what I plan to do within the FRSO, it's what I've done in the CPUSA(though nothing's been published in *People's World* yet) and in the DSA(ditto). What are YOU good at? Sure, you might not be able to do \"direct work\" as you called it, like showing up at protests or doorknocking, but I'm pretty sure that there are disabled people in your area who could use assistance. An important part(in my mind) of being a communist and in a communist party is the principle of building dual power. We have to make ourselves known to the people, get them to understand that we have their interests in our hearts and minds, and the best way to do that is by reaching out to them on a personal level and trying to help them meet their needs. \n\nDo what you can, and do what you're *good at*, and your comrades aren't going to be pissed if you can't turn up at every single protest.

Stalin approved all the arrests and purges.\n\nDo points 1 and 3 not contradict each other? If Stalin approved the many killings and persecutions, then is he not responsible for those crimes? Perhaps I'm misrepresenting Furr here, though, so correct me if I'm wrong. \n\nI would also point towards the 'show trials' during the great purges.

Both our groups have faced a lot of hardships in the U.S. and are often placed at the lowest rungs of American society (hell I've seen other black Americans claim Somalis are not black).\n\nSo I can talk about Marxist ideas with these groups because we're in shit situations. Natives barely benefit from imperialism a lot of the time, the reservations are in third world conditions and our families are messed up from alcoholism and having parents and grandparents that survived the concentration camps. Somalis are fresh immigrants, they don't have a history of being indoctrinated on capitalism like a lot of modern non-somali black communities. Combine that with poverty and heavy racism and I can see why their culture doesn't shut down Marxism. \n\nBut white people will almost always shoot down communist thought because they don't face hardships others face and they're all members of the labor aristocracy. There's some white communist but even then we've seen throughout history they often take reactionary stances (brocialism, Trotskyism, idealism).

She was a foreign graduate student studying civil engineering in the U.S., and she was complaining about how her professor refused to publish her name on a paper despite her contributing significantly. When she protested the professor punished her and cut her stipend. She was saying how it's because she is foreign and a woman and the professor is a man. I imagine this happens frequently so I was sympathetic. But then she said that she wished her professor was white so that he would have more progressive, liberal views. This was pretty shocking, but I diverted and asked where she was from. She tells me she's from Xinjiang (just like the 24-year-old student in the Atlantic piece!) and all of the sudden she's yelling about how she's a Uyghur and many of her family back home is in concentration camps. I kept quiet of course but it was a very informative experience. Here you have this Uyghur woman who is apparently privileged enough to live abroad for over a decade, who studies at a top university, who speaks perfect English, who worships whiteness, and who claims her friends are in concentration camps.\n\nIt took me decades to figure out my Hungarian father defected not because of how evil socialism was but because his mother was a privileged engineer who was part of the brain drain, and then it took an additional five years for my father to finally acknowledge this himself. Now he sings to a much different tune about Hungary and speaks about it as it actually existed instead of viewing it by the standards of Western aristocracy. But he truly believed what he used to say and so did this Uber driver -- she was yelling at me, unprovoked, about how her people share the same sort of history as Native Americans. This is of course fucking nuts but she believed it in her heart. Long story short: Imperialists take advantage of real conflicts (such as those existing in post-war Hungary and those existing in China today) and blow them up to be used as pretense for punishment, and Westerners are morally manipulated to support it. Look what happened to Hungary after the fall of the wall. Imagine what Xinjiang would look like if the Americans had their way.","created_utc":1536314285,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

Everything they suggest is completely acceptable under capitalism - and if anything is going to make capitalism stronger, because that is their goal as a capitalist party. \n\nLabour is not a working class party, 77% of it's members are in ABC1 social grades, seeing that the working class are too busy being attacked by their Labour MPs - it's the usual middle class liberals \"doing their bit\". \n\nIf Labour are a working class party, why are seats in Leeds, Hull, Manchester, and Brighton and Hove (who are staunch advocates of Corbyn) attacking rough sleepers? Why are Labour councils socially cleansing over 40 estates in London - many of which in Corbyn's own borough of Islington. Why did the Labour seat in Birmingham feel the need to spend \u00a36million of tax payer's money attacking bin men's jobs in Birmingham when many of them already live in poverty, Unite (who iirc are one of the main Union's backing Corbyn) were initially against strike action, leaving the bin men to organise the strike on their own? The same can be said for teaching assistants in Durham, and caretakers in Glasgow. John McDonnell even feels the need to call for imperialist action in Syria, denounces Venezula and Corbyn himself blames EU immigration on making conditions worse for workers in the UK - these are not actions of people who represent working people, why are working class people going to continue to vote for the people attacking them under the thin veil that \"Corbyn will sort it out\"\n\nUnite attempt to stop any strike action against Labour councils, they prefer to make deals and side with the councils seeing Unite is full of Labour members.

{"author":"Smychka","body":"I should preface this comment with the statement that I don't agree with *everything* the other comrade said. I am responding your post from my own perspective; not defending the other comrade's views.\n\n&gt;What is sectarian about opposing Labour? They aren't even communists.\n\nThis understanding of sectarianism is mistaken. Sectarianism does not mean criticism of other leftist organisations but *isolation from the workers' movement*. Marx noted as follows:\n\n&gt;\"The sect sees the justification for its existence and its \"point of honour\" \u2014 not in what it has in *common* with the class movement but in the particular *shibboleth* which distinguishes it from it.\"\n\n&gt;Karl Marx, [*Letter to Schweitzer*] (https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1868\/letters\/68_10_13-abs.htm).\n\nContrast this to Marx's comments of the role of communists in [*The Communist Manifesto*] (https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/ch02.htm):\n\n&gt;\"**The Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class parties. They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole. They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement.**\n\n&gt;The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by this only: 1. In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries, they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat, independently of all nationality. 2. In the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through, they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole.\n\n&gt;**The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand, practically, the most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.**\"\n\nTrotsky also comments on sectarianism:\n\n&gt;\"Marxism has built a scientific program upon the laws that govern the movement of capitalist society, which were discovered by it. This is a colossal conquest! However, it is not enough to create a correct program. It is necessary that the working class accept it. **But the sectarian, in the nature of things, comes to a full stop upon the first half of the task. Active intervention in the actual struggle of the working masses is supplanted, for him, by an abstract propaganda for a Marxist program.**\n\n&gt;Every working-class party, every faction, passes during its initial stages through a period of pure propaganda \u2014 that is, the training of its cadres. The period of existence as a Marxist circle invariably grafts habits of an abstract approach to the problems of the workers\u2019 movement. He who is unable to step in time over the confines of this circumscribed existence becomes transformed into a conservative sectarian. **The sectarian looks upon the life of society as a great school, with himself as a teacher there. In his opinion, the working class should put aside its less important matters, and assemble in solid rank around his rostrum. Then the task would be solved.**\n\n&gt;Though he may swear by Marxism in every sentence, the sectarian is the direct negation of dialectical materialism, which takes experience as its point of departure and always returns to it. **A sectarian does not understand the dialectical interaction between a finished program and a living (that is to say, imperfect and unfinished) mass struggle. The sectarian\u2019s method of thinking is that of a rationalist, a formalist and an enlightener. [...] Sectarianism is hostile to dialectics (not in words but in action) in the sense that it turns its back upon the actual development of the working class.**\n\n&gt;[...] The sectarian sees an enemy in everyone who attempts to explain to him that an active participation in the workers\u2019 movement demands a constant study of objective conditions, and not haughty bulldozing from the sectarian rostrum. For analysis of reality the sectarian substitutes intrigue, gossip and hysteria.\n\n&gt;Leon Trotsky, [*Sectarianism, Centrism and the Fourth International*] (http:\/\/forum.permanent-revolution.org\/2009\/05\/sectarianism-centrism-and-fourth.html).\n\nMoving on to the question of the Labour Party.\n\n&gt;Labour is not a working class party\n\nThe Labour Party is a *bourgeois workers' party*. \n\nThis might sound like a contradiction in terms until one considers what it means. Lenin wrote on this:\n\n&gt;\"[T]he Labour Party is a thoroughly bourgeois party, because, although made up of workers, it is led by reactionaries, and the worst kind of reactionaries at that, who act quite in the spirit of the bourgeoisie. It is an organisation of the bourgeoisie, which exists to systematically dupe the workers with the aid of the British Noskes and Scheidemanns.\"\n\n&gt;V.I. Lenin, [*Speech On Affiliation To The British Labour Party*] (https:\/\/www.communist-party.org.uk\/76-m-l-education\/1933-lenin-on-labour-speech-on-affiliation-to-the-british-labour-party.html).\n\nInsofar as the Labour Party remains the political representative of the trade union movement it is necessary not to be *sectarian* towards it in the sense that sectarianism was defined earlier. To that extent, Lenin advocated for the CPGB to affiliate to Labour. Simultaneously, however, Lenin called for ruthless criticism of the opportunist leadership of the Labour Party. Their exposure is necessary in order to win the workers to a genuinely socialist programme and revolutionary party; but at no point must we avoid common struggle alongside working class members of the Labour Party. Our attitude in this respect is the same as our attitude towards reactionary trade unions.\n\nThis brings us to the question of entryism, which is the area where I most likely will come to disagree with the other comrade in some respects. Entryism is not about \"transforming\" a reformist organisation from within \u2014 which the other comrade (wrongly, I believe) conceded was a possibility \u2014 but *exposing* the opportunist leaderships of reformist organisations in precisely the manner outlined above. Its purpose is to organise a revolutionary faction *within* a reformist organisation which at every juncture counterposes consistent revolutionary policies to the bourgeois policies of the organisation's leadership. Such an entryist faction does not conceal its views; it openly expresses them. Its aim \u2014 its sole intention for being present in the reformist organisation \u2014 is to win the reformist workers *away* from reformism and to revolutionary socialism; creating the conditions for the construction of genuine revolutionary party.\n\nJames P. Cannon described entryism as follows:\n\n&gt;\"It should never for a moment be forgotten that the prime objective of such a tactical entry is the creation, consolidation, and expansion of the initial cadres and the growth of ties with the most advanced elements. It is not an end in itself. The immediate aim is to transform a propaganda group into a force capable of influencing, organising, and directing broad masses in action. The ultimate goal is to create a new mass party of the working class along this road.\"\n\n&gt;James P Cannon, [*The Revolutionary Party &amp; Its Role in the Struggle for Socialism*] (https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/cannon\/works\/1967\/party.htm).\n\nLots of comrades, including many who claim to be utilising the entry tactic, misunderstand what entryism is. Nevertheless in the present period when a large amount of people who describe themselves as socialists have been drawn to the Labour Party because of the victory of Jeremy Corbyn entryism is an appropriate tactic. Your comments about the treacherous actions of the Labour Party in recent times merely confirms rather than refutes this fact.\n","created_utc":1536450443,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

This cannot be progressive either. \n\nHowever, Brexit is happening. There are arguments that it is bloodying the nose of the European capitalists, but capital will find a way. \n\na tory EU exit, as is correctly pointed out, is not progressive.

One of the few upsides is that the working class in Britain and across Europe is extremely politically engaged right now. We can cede ground to the reactionaries, or we can use this as an opportunity to raise class consciousness. \n\nFrom an anti imperialist standpoint, I feel that the most serious implications are for undermining the UK's position as a bridge between America and Europe. Traditionally in the post war period Britain has acted as a broker for imperialist intrigue and war. For example, bringing Europe into Iraq. Or on the other side bringing America into North Africa.

The US State  Department complained that Syria had \u201cfailed to join an increasingly  interconnected global economy,\u201d which is to say, had failed to turn over  its state-owned enterprises to private investors, among them Wall  Street financial interests. The US State Department also expressed  dissatisfaction that \u201cideological reasons\u201d had prevented Assad from  liberalizing Syria\u2019s economy, that \u201cprivatization of government  enterprises was still not widespread,\u201d and that the economy \u201cremains  highly controlled by the government.\u201d \\[60\\] Clearly, Assad hadn\u2019t learned  what Washington had dubbed the \u201clessons of history,\u201d namely, that  \u201cmarket economies, not command-and-control economies with the heavy hand  of government, are the best.\u201d \\[61\\] By drafting a constitution that  mandated that the government maintain a role in guiding the economy on  behalf of Syrian interests, and that the Syrian government would not  make Syrians work for the interests of Western banks, corporations, and  investors, Assad was asserting Syrian independence against Washington\u2019s  agenda of \u201copening markets and leveling the playing field for  American\u2026.businesses abroad.\u201d \\[62\\]  \n&gt;  \n&gt;On top of this, Assad underscored his allegiance to socialist values against what Washington had once called the \u201cmoral imperative\u201d of  \u201ceconomic freedom,\u201d \\[63\\] by writing social rights into the constitution:  security against sickness, disability and old age; access to health  care; and free education at all levels. These rights would continue to  be placed beyond the easy reach of legislators and politicians who could  sacrifice them on the altar of creating a low-tax,  foreign-investment-friendly business climate.

In the aftermath of WWII, politicians of that persuasion have been forced to tone down their rhetoric and morph into regular, reactionary politicians committed to the maintenance of liberal democracy. The ruling class will not permit another Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy - they've been burnt by that before.\n\nBolsonaro, for his part, is closer to being a literal fascist than any of the relatively mild far-right politicians in Europe. He openly rejects democracy, calls for leftists to be killed and praises military dictatorship. He is highly dangerous. If he becomes President, expect Duterte-style assassinations of leftists and the destruction of workers' organisations. He cares nothing for the niceties of liberal democracy. He is not a joke. Calling him the Brazilian Donald Trump actually sanitises him and make him seem mild. He is the Brazilian Mussolini. He and the movement behind him constitute an existential threat to the organisations of the working-class. Now is not the time to pay heed to the niceties of liberal democracy, rather, it is time for open class struggle. The working-class need to come out in force against this corrupt right-wing government and against this farce of an election. As another poster on here said, a general strike should be on the order of the day, and this should be the basis on which a socialist revolution should be prepared.\n\nIf the guy that stabbed him isn't some insane wingnut, but is actually a genuine leftist who thought killing him would somehow save Brazil, then that guy is a moron. Asassinations won't solve the problem. Individual acts of terror simply give the state an excuse to ramp up its apparatus of repression and use it against leftists. I won't mourn if Bolsonaro dies, but his death at the hands of a leftist assassin is the last thing which the Brazilian left need right now. He will be turned into a martyr, and new Bolsonaros will take his place. What is needed is collective action on the part of the Brazilian working-class against the continued assault on their freedoms and organisations, and the arrest and assassination of their leaders.\n\n","created_utc":1536514135,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"vngiapaganda","body":"The French Communist Party could've done more during the uprising in France in 1968, but it wasn't ultra-left to point out that the \"revolutionaries\" absolutely were petty-bourgeois students, although they eventually got some support from unions and whatnot. Was it criminal for the party to not support it? I don't think so. You can tell how immature the leadership of the uprising was by reading about it in more detail (eg, their slogans) and understanding that its cause was largely picked up and promoted by bankrupt movements like the New Left and post-structuralist \"Marxists\". The French Communist Party didn't have a revolutionary orientation at that time, certainly, but it was probably impossible for any revolution in France to be successful and it would of course bring a ton of pressure on the USSR. If the students were taken seriously and given leadership roles in what resulted from the uprising after it was successful (hypothetically), it would've been an embarrassing failure.\n\nWith regard to humanism, materialism is the scientific position taken by M&amp;E regarding philosophy, and materialism as a scientific philosophy is absolutely not a humanistic position. In fact, the position of Marx and Engels was spelled out in Anti-Duhring, which is that no truly human morality is possible until classes have not only been abolished, but class society has been forgotten in day-to-day life. That's not a humanist position, but it does point to the conditions needed for a true and honest humanism, which may not look very much like what people currently think of as humanism. However, this concern can be analyzed from a materialist viewpoint, but morality itself is not something that can be based in Marxist science. \"Humanism\" in Marxist theory has always been ideological and typically leads to less effective Marxist science because of its ideological nature. It also points to the least scientific aspects of Marx as the parts to be most attended to, which is why the incredibly \"humanist\" Western Marxism is also incredibly ineffective imo, and why it scientifically suffers when compared to the serious Marxist work that takes place in actually existing socialisms. A socialist country espousing humanism is perfectly fine and good, and most actually do, but it's not founded in dialectical materialism or Marxism as a science.\n\nAlso note that Marx and Engels distances themselves further and further from moralizing the older they got and more experienced they became in class struggle.\n\nAlthusser is almost never spoken of accurately in secondary literature, so it's best to read his actual work imo, and I do think it's extraordinarily valuable when compared to most Marxist work that came out of the West. He's one of the few that remains scientific in orientation and doesn't make a joke out of what Marx and Engels (and Lenin) were trying to do. Take his theory of Marx's \"epistemological break\" -- the secondary literature is universal in saying this is incorrect, but all Althusser is doing there is restating what Marx and Engels \\*said about their own work\\*, which is that it did not take on a scientific character until they were writing The German Ideology. Secondary literature also tries to say absurd things like that Althusser didn't read the Grundrisse, even though Althusser cites it many times.\n\nWith regard to his theory of ideology: he focused on its material determinants. While the structuralist orientation of his theory of ideology does keep talk of the effectivity of subjectivity to a minimum, he doesn't actually fall into an economistic position. His writing on ideology was mostly designed as a counter-weight to the immaturity of the student movement that resulted in the uprising of '68. You have to keep in mind with Althusser that he's always writing in a polemical way, so he purposefully overstates positions. For instance, he always notes that Marxism is strictly an a-humanism and not an anti-humanism, but that he calls it an anti-humanism to push the point further.\n\nWith regard to Althusser saying he didn't have a good understanding of Marxist theory or that he hadn't really read it: this is absolutely false and it's something he wrote while suffering delusions. He very clearly understood Marxism and had read Marx's work closer than pretty much anyone, and with more clarity.\n\nAnyways, there's much more to go into but I've already probably written too much lol. There's stuff to critique with him certainly, but people misunderstand his good points so thoroughly I didn't want to get into it.","created_utc":1536528496,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"18_315x2","body":"I would say that it is important to describe some of the most important marxist ideas encoded in the used vocabulary. For example how workers produce surplus value for the owner of the given means of production (e.g. burgers are worth more than the sum of its components + time spent working + cost of running the machines + etc, and that this surplus value, or something like profit in capitalist terms, goes to the owner of the burger shop). Now based on this simplified example, communism says that the owner of the means of production is not entitled to this surplus value, and they should not be compensated more than the workers for their time. This is the case, because contrary to most capitalists, we do not think that the owner achieved his position by working that much harder (which is true, since wealth is almost always inherites). The solution to this unfair sharing of surplus value is that the workers collectively own, and decide the fate, of the means of production. \n\nThere are more principles to commumism, as described in the communist manifesto (global exploitation and inequality through imperialism, equality of all people), which you could go over if you have enough time.\n\nOther than the basic explanation I would ask about what the students believe to know about communism and provide the marxist arguments countering their (mis)conceptions. If you do not feel up to this tasl, you could post another question here, and we could, again, provide a communist perspective.\n\nFinally, you could explain that within the group of communists different fraction disagree wildly on how a state (not as in nation) where the means of production are globally owned. Present a few different ones, maybe.\n\nThank you for being open enough to give us a voice in education.","created_utc":1536529808,"score":16,"subreddit":"communism"}

I wouldn't expect H.S. Students to read the Communist Manifesto. \n\nThe one pitfall I would avoid is comparing the types of government as in saying: there's democracy then there's communism. Communism is more political economy, the types of government in Communism vary. Marx's ideals were somewhat direct democracy or [Dictatorship of the Proletariat](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dictatorship_of_the_proletariat) but it's important to note that in terms of political science it's somewhat different from a classical dictatorship (authoritarian\/totalitarian by one person). The reason why it is called a dictatorship is that it retains the State and thus methods of oppression and force (eg Weber the state has a monopoly on violence). \n\nEdited to add: the end goal of Marxism is the collectivization of the means of production in that everyone gets a say on what happens. If you set up the dichotomy of Communism vs Democracy many high school students will inherently see Communism as \"something evil\" or something which seeks to destroy democracy when this is not the case. Communism is dialectically opposed to Capitalism. While the theory of liberal democracies states otherwise I believe you need to extract the Cold War thought of \"Communism vs Western Government\/Liberalism.\"\n\nWhile it's factually correct that Marxism seeks to end *the current form* of democracy it is theoretically incorrect in the sense that the *current form of democracy* represents the interests of the bourgeois and not that of the proletariat.

{"author":"WikiTextBot","body":"**Dictatorship of the proletariat**\n\nIn Marxist sociopolitical thought, the dictatorship of the proletariat is a state of affairs in which the proletariat, or the working class, has control of political power. According to this theory, it is the intermediate system between capitalism and communism, when the government is in the process of changing the ownership of the means of production from private to collective ownership, and the existence of any government implies the dictatorship of one social class over another. The term, coined by Joseph Weydemeyer, was adopted in the 19th century by the founders of Marxism, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, both of them argued that the short-lived Paris Commune, which ran the French capital for over two months in 1871 before being suppressed, was an example of the dictatorship of the proletariat. \"Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie\" is thus used as an antonym of \"dictatorship of the proletariat\".It is termed \"dictatorship\" because it retains the state apparatus as such, with its implements of force and oppression, but differs from the popular notion of dictatorship which Marxists despise as the selfish, immoral, irresponsible and unconstitutional political rule of one man.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/communism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1536530786,"score":9,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"jaredfeto","body":"\"I haven't read him, but from what I have read of him his work was largely a reaction to the distortions of both Stalinism and the New Left. However, in my view he went to the other extreme, adopting an excessive structuralism which renders everyone mere pawns of bourgeois ideology. I also do not believe it is correct to see Marx as an anti-humanist - rather, I see him as a materialist humanist, who developed humanism and freed it from bourgeois abstractions.\"\n\nThe problem I have with the Marxist currents that emphasizes humanism is that it is a symptom of how first world struggles were removed from highly fundamental issues like basic sustenance, poverty, starvation etc. and the humanist mania about \"alienation\" or whatever was just the swan song of Western Marxism in the face of first world parasitism. What can you offer to a bunch of people who have attained relatively high standards of living thanks to the distribution of imperialist spoils aside from being bored at work or whatever.\n\n\"Furthermore, we can see where his thought led in practice during an actual revolutionary situation. Like the rest of the French Communist Party, he stood aside from the revolution in an ultra-left manner, dismissing the revolutionaries as petty-bourgeois students and making no effort to influence the real movement to abolish French capitalism as it stood. The criminal policy of the French Communist Party resulted in the defeat of the revolution and the victory of Gaullist reaction. This is a record that one should be ashamed of.\"\n\nThis analysis is in reverse, in my opinion. \"No effort to influence the real movement to abolish French capitalism as it stood\" was not made precisely because no mass in France wanted something like that. People bash (quite rightfully) Bookchin here or in other subreddits but he was much more honest than the rest of First World leftists when he said the era of economic struggles were over and the 68 shit was a movement of dissatisfied students in his most famous pamphlet \"Listen Marxist\". That pamphlet also gets dismissed as being revisionist (which it is, without any doubt) but no one dares to give a strong material explanation to the roots of this revisionism or the outlook of the masses involved in 68, because doing so would automatically call for self-liquidation. I think you should read Divided World, Divided Class by Zak Cope first if your disagreements with Althusser are limited to those you have mentioned above.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I would like to add this regarding the topic of Marxist Humanism. Almost all the efforts to prop up such an idea ended up with so many mindboggling revisionist positions it is actually incredible. Dunayevskaya came up with some \"young Marx\" nonsense that removes all traces of anything scientific in Marxism and dismisses Engels as some authoritarian dipshit. Frankfurt School started with the goal of reclaiming humanism from the left and it fell flat on its face: Adorno just retired from worldly affairs into art, Horkheimer into religion, Marcuse into political-activity-for-political-activity's-sake. Many 68ers fell into hippie bullshit (well, they actually started there lol), some of them went directly into strange sexual shit that they can be dismissed as 69ers. Cohn-Bendit even nosedived into a very contrived defense of pedophilia, claiming that we have to liberate the sexualities of kids.

Obviously one of the two parties that could actually \"take control\" of the state. Generally, they are garbage due to their refusal to represent working class people, supporting neoliberalism &amp; imperialism. While seeing Bernie &amp; DSA-endorsed candidates use the term \"socialist\" is a good thing, they will never be allowed to actually change the party in a concrete way. Keep in mind this doesn't mean we \"embargo\" the party - a lot (if not most) organizers on the left actually get their practice in organizing &amp; what not in this party due to it's size, funding &amp; connections with NGOs &amp; Unions. While they are bad, they are usually better than their Republican counterparts so sometimes there will be interventions by the left in support of the Democrats.\n\n- Libertarian. This is the biggest third party but honestly they aren't infulential. We disagree on basically every point (except maybe for anti-interventionism &amp; gun rights) but the growth of this party signals that people are becoming more politically aware. It's not uncommon to see former libertarians in the ranks of \"leftists\" but I've never heard of Libertarian party member switch sides. Furthermore, I don't see a reason to really support this party in anyway due to their lack of size &amp; the fact they can't win many elections. Also I'm not sure if they are even better than the Democrats. And with Trump's election I feel like libertarianism is out of vogue.\n\n- Green. Kind of an odd party, probably the biggest \"left\" party in the US. They aren't super centralized so their candidates really vary in policy. In Minneapolis they ran a candidate against Socialist Alternative that was actually to the right of the Democrats. While a lot of people see them as kind of useless there's lots of alliances being made between the green &amp; the left due to the lack of size &amp; funding for both sides. And recently Jill Stein has been under attack by the establishment as a Russian agent or something so we should stand in solidarity with her. I'm not really sure what the future of the party is tbh.\n\n- Other parties are either socialist, too small, regional or single issue. The only regional party I'm familiar with is the Minnesota Independence party which is a \"radical center\" party that was Jesse Ventura's old party. Overall they are useless &amp; bad at marketing. We also have a \"Grassroots\" party that is a pro-marijuana party that's a cross between the Greens &amp; MN Independence but they are also useless in that they have no real power other than spreading their message.\n\nOverall, former Democrat voters give us manpower &amp; we do some tactical work with the Greens","created_utc":1536537755,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

Because the cult of personality is not created just like that. Stalin was a dictator (he certainly wanted it), but he personally solved many (not all of course) issues correctly. He possessed an outstanding intellect, he turned the country of the peasants into a second super-power, he won World War II and rebuilt the country after this war in a short time. And most decisions, this is a fact, he took personally.\n\nI'm not trying to justify the cult of personality, because it led to negative consequences after everything (for example after the death of Stalin and Mao, their countries restored capitalism).

The role of the government is more of an administrative body which allocates resources.\n\n3) Communism has never been achieved, and it cannot be achieved until imperialist capitalism is fully done away with, and socialism, which is a historical epoch in its own right, evolves over time into communism.\n\n4) The proletarian state under socialism (as opposed to the bourgeois state under capitalism) is meant to naturally \u201cwither away,\u201d or decay, until \u201cpolitical power,\u201d or the power utilized by one class to oppress another (or others\u2014in capitalism, the state is used by the bourgeoisie to oppress the proletariat), disappears.

{"author":"predalienmack","body":"I will begin by highlighting that I don\u2019t say this to offend or be confrontational. However, I think your comment displays a fundamental misunderstanding of philosophy and science if you think science is the end of philosophy. The scientific view of the world, which relies on empiricism, *is* a philosophical perspective in itself. It is a philosophy that is of course more reliant upon direct observations and the continual testing of those observations as opposed to just observing the world and then making conclusions about the world that you can make logical justifications for, but regardless, the scientific method is still a manifestation of a specific philosophical view of the world (albeit a more rigorous view than most of the ones that came before). It assumes that what we experience around us is real, which is actually difficult to really *prove*, so just like other philosophical schools, science requires some leaps of faith to be made as base assumptions before the method can be applied effectively. The limitations of the human experience (our senses) are provably a limited lens from which we experience the universe through, so our access to knowledge and our experience of the reality we live in will always be fundamentally limited. \n\nI don\u2019t say this to be a naysayer of science of course. Science is invaluable as a method to make conclusions about the world, but it is not and will never be infallible.

{"author":"AmbiguousSalt","body":"I feel that there are a few conceptual issues here, and I admire that you\u2019re taking the time to learn rather than doing what most others do (i.e., engage in intellectual crap-flinging).\n\n1) Private property means, very specifically, private ownership of the means of production. In Marxism, we make a distinction between private and personal property, the latter of which would consist of items used conventionally by people (i.e. computers, personal housing, furniture, etc.). No Marxist (who\u2019s actually a Marxist) is suggesting that we have literally everything commonly owned, just the means of production.\n\n2) Communism definitionally entails a lack of money. If you have money, you don\u2019t have communism. Money comes about mostly as a way to control for scarcity, but for communism to come about, a very high level of technological development would have to be achieved; more specifically, production would be fully or almost fully automated by that point. We would reach what is commonly called \u201csuperabundance,\u201d which just means that there\u2019s enough of the vast majority of items for everyone and more. Basically, this would mean that money no longer has a material reason to exist, and goes away as a result. I guess you could technically have some form of bartering, but it would be strange to say the least at that point, except maybe on individual communal levels (though even that would be kind of odd).\n\n3) Why would you, say, rob others when you could have the sane clothing, food, etc. they have? Rape could obviously be a thing, but that would have to be an issue dealt with by the society. Though I also think that by that point, if communism is in full swing, sexual objectification should be essentially nonexistent.\n\n4) \u201cHuman nature\u201d is a bad argument because people throughout history have been inherently, *necessarily* shaped predominantly by their material conditions. The notion that a mystical \u201chuman nature\u201d may be \u201cgreedy\u201d has been thoroughly refuted in primitive communist (or tribal) societies in which selfishness was considered sinful (for lack of a better term\u2014morally bad?), and tribe members would often be shunned for it. Human beings are remarkably flexible in terms of how they react to their environments. We have no real reason to suppose humans are inherently predisposed to selfish behavior or anything of the sort. This particular point is rejected so thoroughly by communists because, not only has it been refuted, but it is also used by the ruling class to justify its continued rule via the implication that \u201chuman nature\u201d inherently leads historical development to specific types of societies.\n\nI hope that clears up some of your concerns.

{"author":"odei","body":"What is best for the working class?\n\nWhat is most comfortable in the short term is to remain within the EU. Britain is still a major economy, and while it does not dominate the EU as Germany and France do, we're also not in the Euro so they wouldn't be able to punish us as they are doing to Greece, Portugal, and Spain. Buy a tin of dog food for dinner and throw away all your money if you want to know what that feels like.\n\nWhat is the EU in reality though? A feel-good exercise in internationalism and democracy? No. It's a union solely for the purpose of consolidating Western European capitalist interests. Freedom of movement sees millions of people from impoverished (due to the destruction of the socialism in these nations) European countries moving to the wealthier ones (a complete drain on the labour power of these countries), yet in the wake of the refugee crisis caused by European states (often following the US's lead) destroying countries such as Iraq, Libya, etc, they suspend the Schengen zone agreements and start putting up border checks and fences (not to mention letting boat loads of refugees drown in the Mediterranean). Greece even has a deal to send refugees back to Turkey, who end up working in sweatshops.\n\nNot only that, the EU as an international trading body deliberately keeps third world countries underdeveloped. Tariffs mean that certain finished products are uneconomical to export to the EU, so other nations find themselves merely producing and selling raw resources to EU countries. Hence why Germany makes more money from coffee than all African coffee-growing nations combined.\n\nAt home we might enjoy some of the projects and laws that the EU has introduced. But, along with its other flaws, the EU also prohibits the nationalisation of industries. Nothing could make more clear the aims and purpose of the European Union, which is to serve neoliberal capitalism. And now they want to produce an EU army, which will no doubt be well-stocked with expensive Germany, French (and British, if we have another referendum) arms and vehicles, and we can prepare for world war three in order to alleviate the current crisis of capitalism.\n\nOur ruling class is doing everything they can to sabotage Brexit. The working class weren't meant to vote for it and you're certainly not meant to get it. Thus they've been promoting fear (some real fears, some ludicrous), and clearly not been preparing for a 'no-deal' Brexit. And of course the 'deal' Brexit they're angling for would see us in the EU in all but name.\n\nOf course whatever happens, we're the ones to take the brunt of it. Living conditions in Britain have been getting worse and worse, rent is higher, 4m children live in povery, they're destroying council housing and hospitals, schools are being privatised, record numbers of people are using food banks, people are dying because they're being kicked off benefits, and jobs are few and far between. You could blame all this on Brexit, but we haven't actually left yet and this has been the trend for years.\n\nConditions may get worse, but they're getting worse anyway. And from the perspective of the class struggle, Brexit will make the European and British bourgeoisie weaker by driving a wedge between them. We want a weakened class enemy, it makes them easier to fight.","created_utc":1536891847,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"HipsterTrudy","body":"Word sorry was just working a close. So the source for Stalin\u2019s lack of resources to send to the front lines when Solzhenitsyn was an officer comes from \u201cThe Turning Point: Revitalizing the Soviet Economy\u201d by both Soviet economists Nikolai Shmelev &amp; Vladimir Popov. It\u2019s also talked about peripherally in Thomas Sowell\u2019s \u201cBasic Economics\u201d. The \u20181 in 8\u2019 soldiers comes from my high school history class and was repeated by Solzhenitsyn in the VOL1 of the Archipelago. \n\nI would go so far as to say that it is widely known &amp; commonly accepted that after Bill 58 was passed- many of the head engineers and mathematicians were jailed in the country, which led to the infamous decay of the train lines. This prevented trains from delivering any supplies to the front lines and allowed people to steal the iron right off the train tracks as no one was being paid to monitor the rails. \n\nThe source for the substance of his letter is primary. He details his arrest in the first chapter of VOL1 and I personally choose to believe him. This is of course a leap of faith, but his overwhelming honesty and the amount of information he provides regarding the subject is nearly overwhelming. After his death, the Kremlin came out and stated that he had in fact not committed any crimes, yet the transcript of the letter was allegedly burned after he got it back from the interrogator aforementioned during his time in exile. \n\n\u201cAlexander Isayevich (Solzhenitsyn's) entire life was devoted to the fatherland,\" Mr Medvedev said in a telegram. \"He served the fatherland like a genuine citizen and patriot.\" Mr Putin, now the prime minister, mourned a heavy loss.\u201d \n\nThe source of him talking to his interrogators nearly 10 years later in exile comes from his much later publication of VOL3. Again a primary source, but having read it myself I find it more than easy to believe. However, during the transfer of power to the now sanctioned Lubyanka, millions of classified KGB documents were open to the public for several days. Many still-kicking historians, and Soviet economists, tried to grasp as much information as they could before the bureaucratic jaws clamped down on them again. If you go to YOuTube you can listen to several historians talk about the transcripts from the actual interrogators themselves, who seeded that Solzhenitsyn\u2019s letter was in fact extremely mild and was wanted by several publishing companies.

{"author":"elgallopablo","body":"For starters I'll stay away from the low wages argument until later, some people will try to tell you that corporations like Inditex pay higher wages than what is usually payed in those countries, which is a half true at best and a total lie once you look at it more profoundly, something I'll get into later, first lets talk about other problems caused by such corporations.\n\nOne thing that often isn't mentioned is that corporations such as Inditex make a profit because they defer the real costs of production to someone else, and I'm not only talking about low wages, there's a lot of other costs that aren't accounted for in people's minds.\n\n**Enviromental Costs**\n\nThis industries (textile specially) cause a lot of pollution, which in turn ends up being the cause of severe maladies for everyone in a a large radius around their area of production, including their own workers:\n\n&gt; [The report alleges residential areas nearby to the factory are polluted with carbon disulphide levels three times higher than the permitted limit. According to the report, local people told investigators water from their well is now undrinkable due to pollution](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/sustainable-business\/2017\/jun\/13\/hm-zara-marks-spencer-linked-polluting-viscose-factories-asia-fashion)\n\nAnd here we are talking about birth defects, mental heatlh problems and cronic diseases like cancer that are a huge burden not just to the individual afected by it, but also on their families and their society as a whole. And that is before we get into the costs of remediating the pollution they caused. Do you think they go to third world countries just because of the low wages? No, they go to a place where they don't have to remediate the pollution they cause, something that costs a lot of money, and that cost is defered to future generations.\n\nFurthermore, the factories where their clothes are made are actually subcontractors that have to bid for Inditex's bussines by offering the lowest price possible, [so \"going green\" is a cost that they are not going to take](https:\/\/www.thedailystar.net\/business\/news\/no-gain-going-green-1631767).\n\n\n**Taxes**\n\nCorporations like Inditex pay as little in taxes as posible, both in the country where they *are suposed to be from*, but also in the countries where they produce their goods\/extract wealth from.\n\nFirst not paying taxes in the countries where they are suposed to be from. This corporation might have their offices in the country we think they are from, but in reality they build a complex fiscal structure by which they are taxed in Tax Havens, and Inditex is not the exeption, you might think they are a company from Arteixo, but the reality is much more complex than that, meaning that the tiny fraction for which they are taxed goes somewhere where they don't produce anything, and this affects everyone below the owner. First the country where they are suposed to be from, because in order to have had their production moved somewhere else, they surely had a lot of their local workforce laid off, and since they are not paying taxes there, the burden of taking care of the workers who were laid off falls on the society as a whole.\n\nHere are a couple of arricles in Spanish about Inditex not paying thair taxes in Spain.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.publico.es\/economia\/inditex-esquivo-600-millones-impuestos.html\n\nhttps:\/\/www.elsaltodiario.com\/inditex\/zara-no-es-marca-espanola-amancio-ortega-inditex-entramado-fiscal\n\n\nAnd one in English\n\nhttps:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2016-12-08\/zara-under-fire-as-greens-warn-eu-tax-dodging-still-in-vogue\n\n\nBut the real victims here are the countries in which they produce their goods, and at this point we should just be saying *the countries from which they extract wealth*.\n\nSince Inditex is not paying their fair share in those countries either, how will they be able to face the costs that the corporation brought? Where will they get the money to clean up the polution if they aren't taxing the ones who caused it in the first place? They have to raise taxes on the workers themselves.\n\nBecause, whilst corporations pay less taxes every year:\n\n&gt; [The average corporate income tax rate across the OECD has dropped to 23.9 per cent in 2018, from 32.5 per cent in 2000](https:\/\/www.businesstimes.com.sg\/government-economy\/the-world-is-paying-more-taxes-despite-tax-cuts).\n\nThat burden is passed on to society as a whole through the Value Added Tax:\n\n&gt; [Eighty percent of countries in sub-Saharan Africa have adopted the VAT, and it is now responsible for typically raising around one-quarter of all tax revenue](https:\/\/www.theigc.org\/publication\/value-added-tax-developing-countries-lessons-recent-research\/).\n\nAnd not only in underdeveloped countries, [this trend actually started in the developed world](http:\/\/www.oecd.org\/ctp\/tax-policy\/Table-2.A2.1-VAT-GST-Rates-2018.xlsx).\n\nHaveing both a lower Corporate Tax and a higher Value Added Tax, means that those who earn so much money that they can't spend it are taxed a much smaller part of their income than those who earn so little money that they don't make it to the end of the month.\n\n\n**Social Costs**\n\nProduction costs in factories like this are kept low by maximizing the wealth that is extracted from the workforce, and one way they do that is through longer work hours, it's not hard to find factories with 12 hour\/6 day shifts. In the best of cases the burden of raising the worker's children is then placed in the elder generation (grandparents) or in the extended family (uncles, siblings), but in the worst of cases, conditions like that brake families apart by taking parents away from their children, whom, without parental guidence are left to fend for themselves and are raised by the streets. We've already stablished that those corporations aren't paying their fair share of taxes in those countries, so by not giving parents the time to educate their children, the burden placed on the public school system is doubled.\n\nEven so, those factories lure workers with the promise of better wages than what they are currently earning, what Inditex and the like don't tell you is that those workers tend no to be from the cities in which the factory is located, but rather countryside farmers who migrate with the false expectation of a better life than they had in the countryside. This kind of migration destroys farming comunities.\n\nSo now lets talk about what everyone talks about...\n\n\n**Workers Wages**\n\nWages in those factories tend to be marginaly superior to the local minimum wage, allowing the corporation to save face in western media and their subcontractor to have a steady influx of migrant workers, but no more, because as stated above...\n\n**Inditex is not paying the real cost of their production, that cost is being defered, and since Inditex isn't paying their fair share in taxes either, the actual costs of their production are being laid upon those who increasingly bare the weight of taxation, which is society at large and that includes their own workers**.\n\n\n\nPS.

{"author":"Comrade_Zou_Rong","body":"There is so much I want to say in response to this piece, but try as I might, I don't know where to begin trying to translate all the thoughts swirling in my mind into a form that would be understandable to a Reddit audience. I suppose I'll just type what comes to me, and hope for the best.\n\nFirst off, this reads like one of those summation pieces you see groups make every now and then. It is bizarrely combined with poorly reworded ideas about mass-line politics and organization, no doubt because the author(s) have had to come to grips with vague notions about doing mass-line politics with what their actual experiences on the ground tell them.\n\nI read MIM years ago, back before I ever got involved in real-world left-activist politics. Actually comprehending the labor aristocracy, left social-fascist activism, and the strangulation the Democratic Party has on literally anything and everything calling itself \"socialist\" \"Marxist\" \"communist\" or even \"Maoist\" is something I couldn't really fathom, before experiencing it firsthand. It seems not only is each generation of would-be revolutionaries doomed to learn what the labor aristocracy is the hard way, it seems we have to learn it as individuals and groupiscules. There is no method to warn young people what is going to happen to them, to prepare them for what the 'left' really is. Most will just drop out of politics altogether, after being used up and thrown away as trash by cults who operate as an appendage of the Democratic \"Party\" (that thing isn't a party in any sense of the word; real parties have leaders and platforms and such, the DP is just a state-institution masquerading as a political party; the communist parties of Eastern Europe survived the collapse and transformed themselves organizationally, the Democratic and Republican \"Parties\" would simply disappear in a puff of smoke without the US government).\n\nPerhaps worst of all is the realization that after student activism, the only game in town is labor bureaucracy politics, or worse, NGOs. There is no 'Revolutionary Underground' awaiting young radicals who graduate with a degree in left activism. There is no People's Liberation Army to sign up for. There is no war going on inside North America, though this article states, at the very end, the need for a Maoist Party (of \"America\" no doubt) to somehow come into existence, which will then magically bring about this army.\n\nThat's the magical step that seems to elude all Western so-called Maoist organizations. They get some people, a few dozen, maybe more if they're lucky. They all agree on the need to form a people's army. But nothing ever happens. It is as if they think the army will just materialize around them, somehow. Or perhaps they think the army will materialize somewhere else, and then they can go argue with it until they make the Maoist Party (of \"America\") their generals.\n\nAt least, that is assuming they are honest. If they're being honest with people (and themselves), then they can only be delusional. The army doesn't form itself. The party creates the army. The author(s) of this piece talk about basically using the front organizations as recruiting tools (and I applaud them for their frankness here, without trying to jargon it up too much). You use the mass groups to recruit for the party. How do you build the army? You use the party to build the army. That is, the people willing to join a revolutionary organization should also be willing to pick up a gun. And use it. To shoot people.\n\nThis is no doubt why so-called Maoist groups in North America are so hesitant about calling themselves a party, and talk about the need to create one. The hesitancy is because of a clear theoretical obligation; if you are a Maoist party, where is your army? If you call yourself a party, it means you must be building the army, otherwise, what are you doing? So to avoid coming to the realization they have no real intention of doing such a thing, they call themselves a pre-party formation, a collective, or something like that.\n\nThe truth is, there is no reason why a \"collective\" of 3-5 people can't be a party, and from there, to forming a military organization capable of violence. In fact, in a normal world, you would think there would be some sort of competition about who can do this first. The first group that has a *real* military wing is going to be the focal point of the revolution. If there were to ever be a Maoist revolution in North America, it would come from just such an organization. The title of \"America's Mao\" is just waiting to be picked up by the first revolutionary willing to take the plunge. Who is going to be able to (politically) attack this individual? The \"real\" internet Maoists who have no military apparatus, however small? Are they gonna say the people actually planting bombs in government buildings, capturing bourgeois politicians and executing them, robbing banks, printing counterfeit currency, etc, are the fakes, and they're the real thing, because they got a blog somewhere with fancy posts about the mass-line?\n\nThis isn't the reality because something is holding people back. Not even a Third-Worldist analysis can completely explain away the lack of any militarily capable revolutionary group inside North America. ISIS mainly attracts petty-bourgeois people who are quite well off. Having a means to sustain yourself comfortably doesn't make you immune from the ideological call to revolutionary violence. No, there is something else going on, preventing the formation of the Maoist military apparatus in North America. It is this something that needs to be exposed.","created_utc":1537006494,"score":18,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"WikiTextBot","body":"**Grand supercycle**\n\nA grand supercycle is the longest period, or wave, in the growth of a financial market as described by the Elliott wave principle, originally discovered and formulated by Ralph Nelson Elliott.  Elliott speculated that a grand supercycle advance had started in the United States stock market in 1857 and ran to the year 1928, but acknowledged another interpretation that it may have been the third or even the fifth grand supercycle wave. However, these assignments have been reevaluated and clarified using larger historical financial data sets in the works of A. J. Frost and R.R. Prechter, and the start is now considered to be 1789, when stock market data began to be recorded.Like all Elliott waves, grand supercycle waves are subdivided into smaller generations of waves. The next smaller generation of waves are those of  Supercycle degree.\n\n***\n\n**Elliott wave principle**\n\nThe Elliott wave principle is a form of technical analysis that finance traders use to analyze financial market cycles and forecast market trends by identifying extremes in investor psychology, highs and lows in prices, and other collective factors. Ralph Nelson Elliott (1871\u20131948), a professional accountant, discovered the underlying social principles and developed the analytical tools in the 1930s. He proposed that market prices unfold in specific patterns, which practitioners today call \"Elliott waves\", or simply \"waves\". Elliott published his theory of market behavior in the book The Wave Principle in 1938, summarized it in a series of articles in Financial World magazine in 1939, and covered it most comprehensively in his final major work, Nature's Laws: The Secret of the Universe in 1946.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https:\/\/reddit.com\/message\/compose?to=WikiTextBot&amp;message=Excludeme&amp;subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/communism\/about\/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^\/ ^Information](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/WikiTextBot\/wiki\/index) ^| [^Source](https:\/\/github.com\/kittenswolf\/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28","created_utc":1537019165,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

Both CPI (Maoist) the CPP\u2013NPA\u2013NDF use this structure of organization building. Mass organizations and fronts are the seeds of the new worker's state. Militant, extralegal, clandestine, and typically anti-imperialist\/anti-colonialist\/anti-fascist cells or groups are the seeds of the army. These are built in concentric rings around the Party. All in the Party must be in the Army. All in the Army must be in the mass organizations. It is a mistake to build a cadre party without any cadres--all in the Party must be in the Army. If you do not have people who are willing to work for this, then you simply do not have a communist party. You are then just left with revisionism.\n\nYou are entirely correct though--you do need to use the mass organizations to recruit to the party--but not everybody should or can become a part of the Army, or a part of the Party. Only those willing to take on the responsibilities those things entail.\n\n&gt; This is no doubt why so-called Maoist groups in North America are so hesitant about calling themselves a party, and talk about the need to create one.\n\nYou are projecting at this point. There is a reason Maoist groups in NA refer to themselves as pre-parties. They are quite open about this. The cynical editorial that follows in your paragraph here simply does not have a basis in reality. By your standard, if you call yourself a party, but don't have an army, then you are naive or a liar (agreed!). But if you call yourself a pre-party but don't have an army, then you are also lying about your intention to form an army? This is an unreasonable cynicism wherein nobody could possibly satisfy you! Who is left?!\n\n&gt; It is this something that needs to be exposed.\n\nWhat is it?","created_utc":1537027397,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"vngiapaganda","body":"Deep down I think you have to at some point suffer through the agony and pain involved in reading and understanding Hegel's (Shorter, at least) Logic to really get there. Frankly, most the Hegelian framing (eg, that labor is the \"subjective essence\" of private property) is \"Aufhebung\"ed by his published work and is only there because Hegel was the tool he was working with for his critiques (basically this was a constraint of his education and German philosophy that he hadn't yet gotten past). For instance, the reason why labor is the \"subjective essence\" of labor is because (1) the laborer is a subject that is also operating as private property in relation to capital and (2) objective private property is the result of alienated labor (as in, all property is a result of the production of a subject, which is objectified and placed into circulation of capital). The reason it's an \"essence\" is because an essence is kind of like an ultimate point where being folds in on itself (keeping with Hegel) and \"shimmers\" outward, so here labor is the ultimate point where private property folds in on itself because labor is itself private property (as subject, ie a person with consciousness) alienating private property (ie, the products of the laborer).\n\nSo there's an example of what the language means, and you need a good understanding of Hegel to see what's going on without it being something more like an impressionistic painting using words you have an imprecise understanding of. There might be a short introduction to Hegel that gets you there, but I do think at some point you'll want to read Hegel himself. Marx drops this framing in his published work because it's frankly a bit ridiculous and maintains, especially in his early work, a decent amount of idealism still.","created_utc":1537036402,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"[deleted]","body":"Part of the reason for death tolls under communist governments is precisely because people have that \u201cwhataboutism\u201d and that commitment to being difficult with the project of social transformation. Until people see value in it for themselves they won\u2019t budge on communism or socialism.\n\nYou don\u2019t think all these leaders you have heard of like Lenin didn\u2019t have to face difficult people like that? Of course they did. Yet, when society becomes destabilized, people entertain the communist theory and the subsequent collectivization program because...suddenly...it serves their self interest. \n\nIf these people who argue with you stand to benefit from communism, they will support it. If they stand to lose ground from communism, they will oppose it. If they are poor, they must be taught that transcending a social class isn\u2019t likely...but mostly this discontent must be learned and must occur naturally through capitalist greed and the diminishing hopes of the working class as their status become both ambiguous and desperate.\n\nEssentially, I believe all political arguments boil down to a negotiation of personal values. If a person has a selfish desire to maintain power then they will oppose a revolution. Pure and simple. They must benefit and they will renegotiate. If not, sometimes you have to check if this person is actually a true proletarian or a bourgeois. Don\u2019t bother with the latter, sheltered and narrow-minded white-bread, middle-class confidence of some people. Once they start to feel the pain then you step in with a few ideas, no formal names, and let them chew on it. Before you know it they are reading Marx and quoting him back to you.\n\nNow to the other element of what you asked. The death tolls occur when governments collapse and revolutions occur, or disaster strikes. These countries are largely the victims of capitalists!\n\nCapitalism has its death toll, believe me, a lot of it being the actual reason people died under communism. You\u2019re telling me that if capitalist western bankers hadn\u2019t supported the Nazis that they would still have been able to mount campaigns against Russia and France? Give me a break. Communist countries are built on the crimes of the capitalists. Look at the situation after WWI, same thing. Look at Vietnam, look anywhere it\u2019s there. Capitalist crimes become communist votes.\n\nYou can also ask the poor people in the world who get laser-guided bombs dropped on their homes by a decadent western power if they think capitalism has a death toll, I\u2019m sure the Native Americans would agree, the few that live. How many soldiers leave these capitalist armies with psychological disorders and commit suicide? How many perish from improvised bombs for the mere chance to get a college degree? Education under collectivization would be free. Yet, so many must join the meat grinder of capitalism to just enjoy basic necessities of life...\n\nDeath tolls are far higher under capitalism because it feeds on the deaths of its own people and on the deaths of foreign peoples alike. \n\nSo ask yourself who printed the paper these misleading statistics about communism were on. Since they don\u2019t reveal cause and effect....I bet it\u2019s a capitalist source being waved in your face...and that\u2019s no source at all.\n","created_utc":1537091487,"score":8,"subreddit":"communism"}

The stated intention to do so is not equivalently evidence that they are lying, especially when it has been just five years since Red Guards Austin was formed and two since Red Guards KC was formed (if I recall correctly).\n\nThere is no such thing as \"the conditions won't allow it to exist\". On the contrary, the material conditions *demand* its formation. This is evident in the extremely predictable cyclic economic crises that capitalism undergoes, along with the failure of the \"civil\" police state to retains its pseudo-democratic veneer and the complete collapse of social infrastructure in some parts of the country.\n\nAn argument could be made that the social conditions won't allow it, but I just don't think that this is true either. Sure, there are a lot of radicals being funneled into liberal organizations masquerading as socialists, but they have only succeeded in poaching would-be registered Democrats. And only then partially, because the disillusionment among those groups has been fairly severe as well, with a large portion almost instantly shifting left in turn. The youth is completely disillusioned with the capitalist state, despite whatever condescending snark \/u\/Comrade_Zou_Rong uses to characterize them. Sure, many of these will become a part of the legal \"left\", graduating to become lawyers or other bureaucrats with the hopes of \"changing the system from within\", only to become a part of it, but that kind of pessimistic cynicism frankly has no place in communist movements.\n\nBecause even if this were not the case, then how should we conclude? What role does the US (or European) worker play in the international revolutionary movement? Gluttons with no worth or revolutionary potential? An absurd claim with 94.5 million people of color in prison. Or 19 million people living in deep poverty. Or 1.6 million homeless people. Or 5.2 million indigenous peoples whose territory is being colonized. Is the painstaking task of revolution reserved for the toughest, yet most exploited people on this planet: those in the so-called third world? Or is it possible that we can look at these odds, stack them up against our privilege, and recognize that there truly is nothing to support that we have absolutely no responsibility to work against the system that exploits us and hyper-exploits others (and not necessarily to our benefit, at least not even close to proportionately in any event). Yes, it's hard. Yes, it's uncomfortable. People will call you names. You will have to work harder than you ever did before. And you will have to do things that will inevitably place you outside of accepted society (unless you believe that this task requires legalistic work and advocacy campaigns exclusively, in which case you might as well just join a liberal NGO or hell--why not the Democratic Party?). *And there is no other way around that.* Because we *know*, not only in theory, but also from historical and contemporary precedence, that the bourgeoisie will *never* willingly give up their power.\n\nThe good news is that our only one advantage, the leverage that we will use to hoist the bourgeoisie off of our shoulders and the shoulders of the international worker, is that we are many and they are few. So it will be hard and painful in the start and it will require enormous sacrifice, but the larger we get, the more inevitable becomes our victory, and the more assured we are against the attacks of the state and other reactionaries.","created_utc":1537110189,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

They respected the talks that resulted in the EU Association Agreement. They even respected the agreement itself, but simply asked for direct RUS involvement in talks because it was stipulated in earlier Russian-Ukrainian treaties. Even after the bus massacres, the Russian Foreign Ministry played a guarantee role in the ASCU, which was prevented by the coup. After preventing a civil war in Crimea by recognizing the referendum, they waited a few months and literally got the post-May government in Ukraine to sign the very same commercial treaties (offered in November, 2013 and January, 2014) that could have prevented the Kiev protests. After mildly assisting against the ATO, they recognized the post-May government in November of that year, and after the ATO failed, they played and are playing a guarantee role in the Minsk process with the OSCE. If a peace settlement was ever achieved, Russia would obviously stipulate Russian minority rights or zero foreign NATO bases, but they wouldn't start stipulating opposition to German privatization, or majority German shares in major enterprises, or any German monopoly on the sale of capital goods, let alone whatever debt scheme the IMF is pursuing for Ukraine.\n\nI think Russian diplomacy in 2013-2014 is a fair example of their brand of anti-imperialism: drawing red lines (their immediate interests), using mild force, appealing to legal standards set by the US (as someone from the Balkans, I found Russian appeals to the Badinter Commission to legitimate Crimean succession to be brilliant diplomacy), openly calling for and participating in talks with the United States and any allies, respecting immediate US interests, and working with the Chinese to replace unilateralism with multilateralism (using the UNSC in Syria and the BRI across Eurasia).\n\nWhile this is all positive, it isn't the principled anti-imperialism you or I would have. Maybe advanced sections of Russian workers could criticize intra-firm trade or task trading (two core imperialist policies, according to John A. Smith's Imperialism in the Twenty-First Century, 2015), but the Russian government isn't even going to acknowledge it, let alone offer a Soviet-like reform of said trade policy (central plans, full employment, wage scales, price controls) that could influence working class movements everywhere to organize for. Putin is fairly traditional, and if Russian social democrats are following his vision, I think things will be better, but unfortunately, 'better' isn't enough anymore.

{"author":"nice_try_western_spy","body":" \u201cIn the United States, for over a hundred years, the ruling interests tirelessly propagated anticommunism among the populace, until it became more like a religious orthodoxy than a political analysis. During the Cold War, the anti-communist ideological framework could transform any data about existing communist societies into hostile evidence. If the Soviets refused to negotiate a point, they were intransigent and belligerent; if they appeared willing to make concessions, this was but a skillful ploy to put us off our guard. By opposing arms limitations, they would have demonstrated their aggressive intent; but when in fact they supported most armament treaties, it was because they were mendacious and manipulative. If the churches in the USSR were empty, this demonstrated that religion was suppressed; but if the churches were full, this meant the people were rejecting the regime\u2019s atheistic ideology. If the workers went on strike (as happened on infrequent occasions), this was evidence of their alienation from the collectivist system; if they didn\u2019t go on strike, this was because they were intimidated and lacked freedom. A scarcity of consumer goods demonstrated the failure of the economic system; an improvement in consumer supplies meant only that the leaders were attempting to placate a restive population and so maintain a firmer hold over them. If communists in the United States played an important role struggling for the rights of workers, the poor, African-Americans, women, and others, this was only their guileful way of gathering support among disenfranchised groups and gaining power for themselves. How one gained power by fighting for the rights of powerless groups was never explained. What we are dealing with is a non falsifiable orthodoxy, so assiduously marketed by the ruling interests that it affected people across the entire political spectrum.\u201d (Left Anticommunism: the unkindest cut, Michael Parenti, 2015) ","created_utc":1537133527,"score":6,"subreddit":"communism"}

We should talk about how it is a legitimate sovereign power that Western imperialist powers view as a threat. We should insist loudly and constantly that the issues of Korea should be addressed and resolved by Koreans in Korea and not by chauvinistic capitalists trying to establish another country where they can extract wealth in exchange for untold misery and exploitation. We should seek to point out the propagandized and false stories that the capitalist media tells us about the DPRK are often grossly racist biases informing an overwhelming desire for war. \nYou have heard what you have heard about the DPRK because the U.S. wants the DPRK destroyed. That is the context in which news stories are written about the DPRK, and seeking to further repeat these stories means you are either knowingly or unknowingly serving the interests of capitalist empire. It doesn't matter if you personally don't want the U.S. to invade the DPRK when you go around telling others about how evil and foreign the DPRK is, because the effect is the same.

Think about the information you\u2019re given. The imperialists would love nothing more than to crush the DPRK with the full support of the public. Calling governments \u201cdictatorships\u201d (i.e. the Maduro and Assad governments, both of which are democratically elected) is a classic tactic in the imperialist playbook to justify foreign intervention. After all, imperialism is still more merciful than evil dictator Kim, right? Whenever you hear a piece of information, put it through class analysis. Would the bourgeoisie benefit from lying about the situation? What do the facts we know indicate? etc.\n\nThe reason we Marxist-Leninists support the DPRK is that it is a socialist country. They have free education, universal healthcare, a right to work, guaranteed housing, and guaranteed food. They also have a dictatorship of the proletariat; their government is not politically dominated by a bourgeois class. In addition, we as Leninists are avowed enemies of imperialism.

I don\u2019t feel entirely compelled to respond to whatever you just spewed, but I will make a few comments.\n\nFirst off, an amount of people within a self-proclaimed red political party doesn\u2019t make it red. What matters is what these parties have done in practice. Cuba and Vietnam remained tied to Soviet social-imperialism and when the Soviet Union dissolved, there were attempts at independence and the delinking from that former neo-colonial chain, but these countries rapidly went from being puppets to somewhat independent, all because of their revisionist leading-parties that have been keeping them from full independence and self-reliance. While Cuba remains close to imperialist countries like Russia and China, Vietnam has allowed the U.$. imperialists to essentially steal the entire country.\n\nAs for China, we can call it internally as social-fascism, in the stage of what some call \u201csoft fascism\u201d, and the people of the global south recognize that the country is no longer on the socialist-road, and has in fact become an imperialist country.\n\nInternally, 80% of the industrial workforce toils in the private sector, and the percentage of the population covered by public healthcare programs has floundered to 4%.\n\nChina is also trying to capture oil and gas deposits in the Philippines \u2014 alongside its stealing of many soil and it\u2019s occupation of the West Philippine Sea, that\u2019s why China has aligned itself with Duterte, an un-popular anti-people dictatorship which has devasted the lives of millions, for imperialist interests.\n\nNo socialist country would be so forthright in supplying weapons to a reactionary &amp; criminal regime like that of Duterte\u2019s dictatorship \u2014with its systemic violations of political rights and it\u2019s outright murder of civilians, it\u2019s cutting of health and agricultural budgets, and inability to deal with hunger and starvation \u2014 it would be foolish to say China is socialist when it backs this country, alongside Saudi Arabia, mind you.\n\nAnd regarding what China is doing to Sri Lanka, there\u2019s obvious attempts at maldevelopment going on. Just recently, Sri Lanka had to give over a strategic port to China, due to a debt of $8 billion. This is of a continuing effort to encroach upon the sovereignty of the Sri Lankan people.\n\nThese debt traps which reinforce a relation of reliance and exploitation are a common tool of the imperialists all-around the world \u2014 to deny it is to deny reality. No imperialist cares about the development of third-world countries, they only care about profit and that neo-colonial relationship of exploitation. Unequal economic deals and the such undermine and maldevelop the third-world, period.\n\nI could also go on about what\u2019s going on in Latin America &amp; Africa regarding China, but I really don\u2019t feel compelled to with you.\n\nAnd sure, the Chinese economy has grown, no one denies that it\u2019s the second or even first biggest economy in the world *(this capitalist world...)* but within the capitalist framework, due to its participation in plunder and exploitation. \n\nAnd as for the claims of genocide, I\u2019m not here to respond to Hollywood propaganda. I can\u2019t believe a self-proclaimed communist like yourself supports regional hegemony which was literally condemned by all progressive forces around the world. It\u2019s akin to Amerika saying it invaded Indochina in the name of halting the advance of evil communism and the subsequent genocide it could bring, etc., its a false justification for unjust war.\n\nYou need to look into Mao, his writings will benefit you greatly.

Instead of coops working against each other, it's optimal for worker's syndicates to set-up a decentralized council in order to present general goals and strategies, but each syndicate should be able to have its interests amply represented such that their representatives in the aforementioned council need to be reprimanded for straying from the consensus of their constituents.

There is currently a fascist party, the Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), sitting in our parliament with about 12,6% of the votes. And yes, it is most definitely a fascist party. That it has proven over and over. Making excuses for Nazigermany, calling the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin a \"memorial of shame\", advocating for the hunt of our Chancellor and saying that elected representatives should be disposed of to other countries, of course on racial features. \n\nFurthermore it supported the protests and marches in Chemnitz about two weeks ago. These lead directly to a \"Hetzjagd\", a violent hunt, of migrants, refugees and all those that look like they would be part of such groups. Little children with headscarfs had to seek shelter in icecream stores because they were frightened by these mobs. Just one day later the marches were even bigger, drawing up to 8k people to them. There were sightings of the nazi salute, the \"Hitlergru\u00df\"- hitler greeting, of people saying that they march in the name of the F\u00fchrer, of people chanting for national socialism.\n\nAnd, to top it all off, our very Ministry which is tasked with protecting our constitution, the \"Verfassungsschutz\", is undermined in the highest stages. Maa\u00dfen, the president of the Verfassungsschutz, has been giving away crucial, non-public information on the AfD to the AfD. He has warned  the AfD several times in the past how to keep low as to not be monitored by the Verfassungsschutz. He also has downplayed the events of the Chemnitz marches and said that there was no evidence for the hunts, despite there being more than enough.\n\nAll in all, it looks rather bleak here.","created_utc":1537198712,"score":19,"subreddit":"communism"}

There is obviously \u201cclass mobility\u201d (i.e., a proletarian can become a member of the bourgeoisie and vice-versa), but the point is that everyone can\u2019t do that because there would be no profit.\n\n2) What is profit? This article equivocates on what Marx means by exploitation. For Marx, if profit exists, exploitation must also exist. Why? Because profit is the extraction of surplus labor value from workers. This, according to Marx, is exactly what exploitation means\u2014that extraction. Whether or not someone bourgeois-moralistically objects to the use of that term for the process is irrelevant.\n\n3) A worker can never enter a contract to get the full value of his or her labor. Why? Because, again, the capitalist would get no profit. Now, the company could share stocks with workers, but where capitalist profit exists, exploitation also must somewhere exist.\n\n4) The article calls proletarians \u201cslaves.\u201d Anyone who isn\u2019t a disingenuous fool could obviously see that Marx and Engels aren\u2019t saying that proletarians are \u201cslaves\u201d in the sense of never being paid. The core of what they\u2019re saying is that the proletarians must sell their labor power, piecemeal. The conclusion to which they come is that, while proletarians have a (sometimes very limited) degree of choice in where they work, they must still collectively sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie. In this sense, they are slaves\u2014not strictly speaking \u201cslaves\u201d as in they\u2019re never paid and given meager subsistence, but that they must sell themselves to the ruling class.\n\nThere are some other egregious problems with the article, but these are the biggest points that I think need to be addressed.\n\nEdit: Another reason everyone can\u2019t own their own means of production (i.e., become bourgeois) is because of the labor processes and such themselves.

We all know that the political form of the \u201cstate\u201d at that time is the most complete democracy. But it never enters the head of any of the opportunists, who shamelessly distort Marxism, that Engels is consequently speaking here of democracy \u201cdying down of itself\u201d, or \u201cwithering away\". This seems very strange at first sight. But it is \u201cincomprehensible\u201d only to those who have not thought about democracy also being a state and, consequently, also disappearing when the state disappears. Revolution alone can \u201cabolish\u201d the bourgeois state.

I mean, sometimes it's not worth wasting your time replying to such hollow posts, but in this case I'll have a small indulgence.\n\n&gt;Because even if this were not the case, then how should we conclude? What role does the US (or European) worker play in the international revolutionary movement? Gluttons with no worth or revolutionary potential? An absurd claim with 94.5 million people of color in prison. Or 19 million people living in deep poverty. Or 1.6 million homeless people. Or 5.2 million indigenous peoples whose territory is being colonized.\n\nIt should be noted that *universally* the people in the First-World countries blathering nonsense about \"People's War\" are are *all* First-Worldists. To be so delusional pretty much requires a completely wrong analysis of social-reality to begin with.\n\nTo anyone who knows something about the total number of prisoners in the world, it isn't anywhere close to \"94.5\" million, not even if this person is just using some rhetoric about including the entire non-European population as being in prison. There are only about 9 million people behind bars on the entire planet. So anyone reading this should realize people like StalinIII don't care about factual accuracy when it comes to understanding the world.\n\nBut again, it must be noted, these people actually believe the army is just going to spring up around them. This is why \/u\/StalinIII is spouting these numbers like they mean something; he thinks *they* are going to be the army. They don't *believe* it is the duty of the Party to create the army. They think the army is just something that grows organically out of the dirt, like a plant, and they think they can just pluck it out of the ground. They're not serious, and as such, have no intentions of actually forming an army right now.\n\nIn the real world, you could begin a terrorist cell attacking the government with just a handful of people. Here is some instructions for StalinIII, and anyone around him that might be serious, to get their operation going.\n\n1. Take your 3-5 people formation. 2 of the people are now going to do *illegal* work. The other 3 are doing front work. The purpose of the front work is to create more *illegals* (Party-people doing illegal work for which they could be arrested). Eventually you may need to create some formal distance between the illegals and the legals. Pretty much all *real* parties that have a military apparatus do this, as it prevents their legal apparatus from being completely shut down via the bourgeois legal system. But that comes later.\n\n2. Have the illegals do activity toward gathering funds to pay for people to live. Soldiers need money to survive. You need to pay for safehouses, food, guns, etc. Probably the most lucrative activity you could do, while remaining fairly safe, is creating counterfeit currency. If none of the illegals know how to do this, *assign* them the task of learning how to do it. Start passing off the fake notes via any method available, including running a front business where you take real money from customers and give them back bogus change.\n\n3. Once you have a method of sustaining the illegals, you need to recruit more of them. This is where your front organizations come in.\n\nIn the front groups, you need to recruit the most violent people you can. These are the people that are *easily* egged on into violence against counter-demonstrators, police, etc. The more violent tendencies, the better. On top of that, if they have no means of a sustainable income, all the better. This means they could be amenable to permanent recruitment as an illegal. \"The party has a job for you...\"\n\nObviously you don't want to recruit completely unstable people for this, and in any case, they will need sufficient levels of ideological hardening before they are really ready to devote their lives to revolutionary violence, but this is a judgement call the Party will have to make.\n\nThis basic outline is self-sustainable, and can be done by any *serious* revolutionary organization. [There is a very famous proof of people who self-identified as Maoists doing activity like this with only a handful of people and successfully funneling millions of dollars to Third-World revolutionary movements](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blekingegade_Gang), so don't even bother denying this is possible **right now**.\n\nSo why aren't First-World so-called Maoists doing this already?

{"author":"StalinIII","body":"Ahh, is that so Mr. Unruhe? Would you mind sharing, in your bountiful wisdom and experience (I assume that you have already organized a counterfeiting gang), exactly what kind of delusion you'd have to be suffering in order to publicly announce your intention to carry out federal crimes as an organization, making sure to include as much specific details as possible?\n\nAt first, I wondered if you were accusing me of simply LARPing and that your core argument was that nothing that so-called \"First Worlders\" can do will ever progress any proletarian revolution, but I see now that I'm hilariously mistaken. I don't want to pig-jacket you, but I genuinely can't help but question the motives of a person who would so openly endorse and encourage crimes of this magnitude and with this specificity, while deriding all who do not follow suit.\n\nI am not saying that communists should not be open about the work that they do, or deceive people, but on the other hand there is clearly a middle ground between operating an illegal street gang while lying to the masses about your work and advertising your criminal intentions to every police and intelligence agency with an internet connection. Simply put, you have absolutely no idea what Red Guards groups (or any other communist organization for that matter) do in their entirety *and that's exactly how it should be.*\n\n&gt; To anyone who knows something about the total number of prisoners in the world, it isn't anywhere close to \"94.5\" million, not even if this person is just using some rhetoric about including the entire non-European population as being in prison. There are only about 9 million people behind bars on the entire planet. So anyone reading this should realize people like StalinIII don't care about factual accuracy when it comes to understanding the world.\n\nYou are absolutely correct, and I apologize for the mistake. If anyone is wondering, I got this number by looking at [this](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Incarceration_in_the_United_States#Ethnicity) breakdown, where I incorrectly interpreted the \"% of US population\" field as the percentage of the population imprisoned (which of course is nonsense, since that would imply that 100% of the US population is imprisoned). That figure represents the number of Black and Hispanic (with all the problematic implications US racial code terminology entails). As you correctly point out, there are roughly 6.5 million people in the US imprisoned, on parole, or on probation. 2.5 million of those are in prison, and around 800,000 of those are people of color.\n\nThe point still stands: there are tens of millions of people who are disenfranchised by the system, daily victimized by the police state, and almost irreconcilably at odds with the bourgeois state. Still tens of millions more who do not fall into these categories are no doubt clamoring against a system that serves a tiny group of parasites whose only profession is playing roulette with their family's livelihoods and hands them the bill when things sour. I have not implied that revolutionary organizing is as simple as waiting for them to spontaneously form an army. On the contrary, I have said that it will require extreme sacrifices and persistent determination to work towards organizing them. This means ideological education and practical training.\n\nI have also said that all other successful people's armies have undergone the same developments. I gave you two examples. Had resistance to the Tsar or the colonization of China or Japanese fascism been allowed to continue in a spontaneous, disorganized manner, the USSR and China would not have won their overwhelming victories for the people.\n\n&gt; This basic outline is self-sustainable, and can be done by any serious revolutionary organization. There is a very famous proof of people who self-identified as Maoists doing activity like this with only a handful of people and successfully funneling millions of dollars to Third-World revolutionary movements, so don't even bother denying this is possible right now.\n\nIt can be done. But it shouldn't be done. At least not in the way that you've outlined it here. There is no *serious* revolutionary organization that operates in this way today and there won't ever be a *serious* revolutionary organization that will, because any organization that operates in this way, regardless of the purity of their intentions, simply has not learned from the 250+ years of the proletariat's experiences with waging People's War. Your example is a shining one for my argument. While they were most certainly successful in many ways, it's obvious that this is not a path that leads to revolution--*anywhere*--not in the \"first world\", nor in the \"third world\". There has been no proletarian revolution in Sweden and there has been no proletarian revolution in Palestine.\n\nThe idea that proletarian revolution is waged by 5-10 people who perform a coup or a series of subversive campaigns that ultimately topples governments is not only conspiratorial and completely divorced from reality, but it is in the end a petit bourgeois concept. It takes underestimation and mistrust of the masses as its starting point. It goes against the proletarian worldview of the masses making history, and instead adopts in a \"Great Men\" conception of history. But most importantly, it flies in the face of empirical evidence. This has never worked as a sustainable and ultimately successful model of making revolution. Protracted people's war has.\n\nThis does not mean that one should not organize clandestine and illegally, but it *does* reject the petit bourgeois notion of adventurism. Even in the rare cases where a small group has been successful (as in Cuba), it's clear that the end result is not a proletarian victory. As excellent as the Cuban Revolution was, this method of organizing is ideologically stunted from the start. The worker's state is not built as an afterthought following revolution. The revolution itself is the creation of the new state. And not least, our greatest strength as a class is our numbers.\n\nIn terms of recruiting and organizing for militancy and illegality, I believe that most revolutionary organizations take this as their model. Including Red Guards KC. Other than not explicitly saying \"we are going to do this and that illegal thing\" on a public blog post, I don't see how this is at odds with much of what you're saying. Only that this process is not done to fund so-called \"Third World\" revolution, but the revolution at home. Which is the best (and *only*, I'd argue) way to practice solidarity with the international working class--the best way to smash the parasite that exploits the so-called \"Third World\".","created_utc":1537264531,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

So don't expect them to be organizing any \"People's War\" any time soon.\n\n&gt;I don't want to pig-jacket you, but I genuinely can't help but question the motives of a person who would so openly endorse and encourage crimes of this magnitude and with this specificity, while deriding all who do not follow suit.\n\nNotice what he is saying: only a police officer would actually talk about conducting \"People's War.\"\n\nAssuming this person is honest (which is not obvious by any means), this only makes sense in their mind because \"People's War\" is just a meaningless phrase, symbolic of so-called Maoist discourse in North America. It isn't a real plan of action; it signifies your allegiance to a particular brand of cult ideology, an ideology ultimately controlled by the Democratic Party.\n\n&gt;Simply put, you have absolutely no idea what Red Guards groups (or any other communist organization for that matter) do in their entirety and that's exactly how it should be.\n\nThe purpose of this statement is to insinuate to the reader so-called Maoist groups may in fact be doing revolutionary stuff, and not \"mass\" \"line\" work that only serves the function of organizing for the Democratic Party. Anyone with a brain can figure out exactly what \"Red Guard\" groups are doing, and it isn't the slightest bit different from the usual First-World \"Left\" activist fanfare. This is public knowledge, because they boast about it on the blogs they control.\n\n&gt;The point still stands: there are tens of millions of people who are disenfranchised by the system, daily victimized by the police state, and almost irreconcilably at odds with the bourgeois state. Still tens of millions more who do not fall into these categories are no doubt clamoring against a system that serves a tiny group of parasites whose only profession is playing roulette with their family's livelihoods and hands them the bill when things sour.\n\nAgain, the reader can plainly see he thinks there is a basis for literally millions of people in North America to start picking up weapons and using them against the government. Nothing could be more delusional than this. First Worldism is a delusion, a delusion that serves the ends of the Democratic Party and nothing more.\n\n&gt;I have not implied that revolutionary organizing is as simple as waiting for them to spontaneously form an army. On the contrary, I have said that it will require extreme sacrifices and persistent determination to work towards organizing **them**.\n\nThe attention of the reader should be drawn here to \"them.\" He thinks the work of a revolutionary organization is getting \"them\" to *do* \"People's War.\" He does not even conceive of building an army in a way that isn't just a fantasy. He denies that he thinks the job of a Maoist party is just to sit around, waiting for the masses to spontaneously form an army, and then says it about getting \"them\" to do it. It never occurs to him that it is the Party *itself* that creates the army *out of itself*.\n\n&gt;It can be done. But it shouldn't be done.\n\nThis should be read as an admission so-called Maoists are not the slightest bit serious.\n\n&gt;While they were most certainly successful in many ways, it's obvious that this is not a path that leads to revolution--anywhere--not in the \"first world\", nor in the \"third world\".\n\nIt should be obvious to the reader that StalinIII is just a liar at this point, and could only substantiate this nonsense with the worst sort of phrase-mongering. In fact, the opposite is the case: literally all armed revolutionary movements (Maoist or otherwise) are direct creations of a party that creates the military apparatus *out of itself*. To deny this is to deny reality, but that First-World so-called Maoists have a reality problem should surprise no one.\n\n&gt;adventurism\n\nThis is the cry of the \"revolutionary\" parasite.\n\n&gt;I believe that most revolutionary organizations take this as their model.\n\nThis, again, is an attempt to insinuate to the reader First-World so-called Maoist groups may actually be doing something revolutionary. It is a bald-faced lie.","created_utc":1537271924,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

I get it: you're trying to cultivate the over-the-top arrogance characteristic of the keyboard warrior douchebag who spends their time ridiculing leftist movements and encouraging everybody to either A) very openly declare and commit highly illegal crimes or B) join them on the couch doing absolutely nothing at all. Do us all a favor and dial it back about 15 notches. Don't worry--nobody is going to out-tank you.\n\n&gt; This is an example of how fearful so-called Maoists in North America are.\n\nNo, this is an example of how Maoists in North America are not fucking idiots.

They do it because they don't want to do pig work.\n\n&gt; Notice what he is saying: only a police officer would actually talk about conducting \"People's War.\"\n\nThat's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that provocateurs have *the sole job* of encouraging people to perform risky and illegal actions that will almost certainly get them caught. One of those things is publicly announcing their intention to commit federal crimes on web services that *are laughably easy to trace to individuals*. Yes, even if you use Tor. Yes, even if you use a VPN.\n\nAlready your delusion that it would be wise for Maoists to hand deliver proof of guilt directly to the police is concerning. But that you moreover would ridicule Maoists for not doing so and suggesting that this disqualifies them as Actual Maoists (TM) should immediately be setting off some huge red flags. I'd go as far as to say that this is something that the moderators of a \"communist\" sub should outright prohibit. Though in fairness, we all know this is a revisionist sub and either through naivety or the shared misanthropic worldview common to Third Worldists, no such thing will happen.\n\n&gt; Assuming this person is honest (which is not obvious by any means), this only makes sense in their mind because \"People's War\" is just a meaningless phrase, symbolic of so-called Maoist discourse in North America.\n\nWhat *you're* saying is that unless communists intentionally get themselves arrested or killed, they are not really communists. NO WAIT--your insanity reaches far enough to claim that if communists intentionally get themselves arrested or killed, *they are straight up agents of the Democratic Party*. I think we've peaked. Which mind-altering substance you scrounged up in your gentrified hipster neighborhood helped you come up with this conspiracy theory?\n\nUnless you have any actual evidence to support this claim (maybe George Soros is also in on, huh?), I simply refuse to legitimize this with a response! The imagined audience that you have built up to justify your arrogant behavior should be *gravely insulted* that you believe them this stupid!\n\n&gt; Again, the reader can plainly see he thinks there is a basis for literally millions of people in North America to start picking up weapons and using them against the government.\n\nIf you don't believe this, then you don't believe that the people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history. And that's fine, but that simply means that you're not a communist. Obviously these people cannot *immediately* carry out an armed struggle *today*. If they could, they'd have done so by now. The material conditions *absolutely* make this possible, but as has been pointed out elsewhere, the social conditions do not. It is an extremely arrogant, lazy, selfish, and ultimately chauvinistic position to take that because of this, communists in the so-called First World should do absolutely nothing. Obviously given these conditions, the primary work of communists must be to raise the level of class consciousness among the masses, educate them ideologically, learn from their experiences, return this knowledge back to the masses, and thereby recruit to the Party, the Army, and the Front. There do not exist millions of people in North America ideologically or physically prepared to carry out a revolution. There do, however, exist millions of people in North America who occupy a position in society that would make them ideologically (owing to their disenfranchisement and subjected position in society) and physically (owing to the disciplined nature of their daily routine, as opposed to by and large petit bourgeois armchair communists who spout nonsense about \"goddamn First Worldists\") receptive to revolutionary organizing and who can be made to be prepared for joining the Party and the Army.\n\nWithin this kernel, I don't really see a contradiction between what we are saying, besides the obvious fact that you have constructed a strawman out of me and are almost deliberately talking past me because you have already made up your mind that anybody who supports Maoism or Maoists is clearly a \"goddamn First Worldist\" who is lying and actually a puppet of the Democratic Party.\n\nThis is precisely why this:\n\n&gt; The attention of the reader should be drawn here to \"them.\" He thinks the work of a revolutionary organization is getting \"them\" to do \"People's War.\" He does not even conceive of building an army in a way that isn't just a fantasy. He denies that he thinks the job of a Maoist party is just to sit around, waiting for the masses to spontaneously form an army, and then says it about getting \"them\" to do it. It never occurs to him that it is the Party itself that creates the army out of itself.\n\nis so ridiculous. Because *literally where have I said that the Party does not create the army out of itself*?! I have very explicitly said that\n\n&gt; All in the Party must be in the Army. All in the Army must be in the mass organizations. It is a mistake to build a cadre party without any cadres--all in the Party must be in the Army. If you do not have people who are willing to work for this, then you simply do not have a communist party. You are then just left with revisionism.\n\nRead it a second time. Really. Because then you will have read **SIX** times that the Party builds the Army and that all in the Party are in the Army. I.e. that \"the Party itself creates the Army out of itself\". **Seven** times now, but hey--I bet you are going to repeat yourself and claim that I have said the opposite anyway because you are a fucking snake.\n\n&gt; This should be read as an admission so-called Maoists are not the slightest bit serious.\n\nYes, I admit it. We Maoists are not so serious that we are willing to intentionally get ourselves arrested. We are so unserious that we would rather do things *that actually work*. So unserious are we about revolution that we would rather pursue things that have empirically lead to successful revolutions than spend chunks of time in prison. Ya got me.\n\n&gt; This is the cry of the \"revolutionary\" parasite.\n\nYou think that revolution is the task of the world's most exploited--whose exploitation bankrolls the larger-than-average breadcrumbs that fall from the bourgeoisie's table and into our laps--and that our job is moral support, or perhaps to send some money their way. But *we're* the parasites. Okay.\n\nIt's almost as if you believe that money and resources writes history--not the masses. Again, fine if you believe that, but that simply means that you are not a communist.\n\n**Moreover,** the only actual point of disagreement--aside from the strawmanning and irrational hatred for Maoists and Red Guard groups--par for the course for a sub filled with fucking revisionists--is that I believe that almost all of the components of organization building you outlined should be carried out, *but* communists should not hand-deliver proof of guilt directly to the police *and* those resources and training should be directed to organization building in the country where they reside.

On the national level however I wouldn't be so sure as M will form a government with SD. Ulf Kristersson, the party leader of M, has been very clear that he only wants to govern with the Alliance (the four right wing parties excluding SD).\n\nThe Center Party(C) and the Liberal Party(L) have said that they will not govern together with, or even with the passive support of SD. C has been very outspoken with their view on immigration and anti-racism which is in direct conflict with SD:s goal of anti-immigration.  I do agree however that they are more right leaning and if S would start a government with them they would need to move away from left wing policies. C does have something to gain from a center government though as they could focus more on environmental issues, small scale companies and rural development and support. These are all main policies of C that they have issues getting passed in a right wing government. They are however reluctant to cooperate with S and there has been speculation that S might offer L\u00f6\u00f6f the prime minister position in order to persuade them to agree.\n\nThe only way the Alliance will govern is with the support of a left wing party, which is unlikely. In turn the left wing parties will only govern with the support of the Alliance, which they have been doing the last 4 years in a minority government. It's very clear however that the Alliance wants to rule themselves, so their support for the left is also unlikely. S has reached out several times across the left-right block in order to start a center government with C and L. S is more center that you might think, the socialism is mostly history as they have moved towards the right ever since they lost power in the early 2000s.\n\nIt is however very complicated and there will have to be compromises from both sides unless they want to risk a reelection.\n\nEdit: spelling","created_utc":1537306650,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

I was especially interested in the responses that pointed out how lacking in internationalism the proletarian movement seems to be, and how we've allowed unions to be rolled back by neoliberalism. It strikes me that the objective, material conditions for socialism are already in place in much of the developed world; it's the *subjective* conditions that are lacking. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like these responses were so focused on our First World that they neglected the socialist movements of the Third World, where what seems to stand in the way isn't the underdevelopment of the subjective conditions for socialism, but rather the underdevelopment of its *objective* conditions. That seems to be the great irony of revolution: where the infrastructure, productive forces, and labor discipline are at their least advanced, the less likely the masses are to tolerate their conditions; meeting the objective conditions for socialism seems to lead into a certain level of comfort and complacency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, I have some reservations about the notion that the socialist countries aren't cooperating as they used to before the liberalization of the Soviet Union. A glance at this very sub-reddit shows me that socialist countries are still working hard to aid one another, even as China, now the major socialist power, tries to help advance Africa. Even so, the general theme of their responses (minus the last about leftists wanting \"power within capitalism\") makes sense, which is that a strong, international communist movement will depend on developing countries having the opportunity to \"delink\" from the U.S.-dominated global market, workers of developed countries struggling to regain ground against capitalism through class struggle and unionism, and proletarians of all nations uniting (which was important enough an idea that it closed out the *Manifesto*).","created_utc":1537306706,"score":9,"subreddit":"communism"}

Let\u2019s establish some quick population-oriented facts: African Americans and Hispanic\/Latino Americans (these classifications are from the national census by the way) together make up roughly 30% of the total population in the US. White people make up about 60% of the population. \n\nLet\u2019s now establish some terminology: the proletariat are those who do not have control over the means of production and must sell their labor to those who do own those means in order to survive. The petite bourgeoise is typically a term in Marxist analysis most applicable to small scale capitalists in the 18th and 19th centuries, but in modern times they are pretty much the typical \u201csmall business owner.\u201d \n\nIf we are to go off these definitions, the proletariat would necessarily make up a vast majority of the US population because the vast majority of people do not have any control over the means of production and have to sell their labor to survive, including people of all ethnic backgrounds. If the majority of the proletariat in the US were just people of color, as you claim, that would mean the proletariat would make up less than a third of the population, which is ludicrous because that is simply not how capitalism works, and it is not how power, wealth, and influence is distributed in a capitalist society (where the capitalists at the top are a very small portion of the population). Your claim that most white people are petite bourgeois is also categorically false because that would mean the petite bourgeoise would make up over half the population, which would be completely unsustainable in the capitalist system because bosses need workers under them in order for small capitalist ventures to function, and there would not be enough workers if the small time capitalists were 50% or more of the population. Capitalism, as an economic system built upon class divisions, necessitates that the *majority* of people in general must be servants to the ruling class, not just the majority of those belonging to oppressed ethnic groups. \n\nIt seems that you are making your assumptions based on your experiences in Los Angeles and California in general, which is one of the most expensive cities and states to live in in the entire US, so you are being exposed to an extreme cross section of the US population that really isn\u2019t reflective of the population around the country as a whole. Most white people in the US won\u2019t make enough to afford the houses affluent white people live in in the bougie suburbs of LA in their entire lifetimes of working. White people all over the country live in similar economic and residential conditions to those of oppressed ethnic groups in lower income areas. It is nowhere near the same percentage of white people living in such desperate conditions, but the majority still live as oppressed workers in the proletariat regardless, and those who are of the proletariat have far more in common with one another, across ethnic, religious, sexual, sexuality, gender, etc.-based lines, than they ever will have with the bourgeoise, no matter their backgrounds. \n\nYour conclusion based on these shaky assumptions appears to be that we should advocate for ethnostates for the oppressed ethnicities. Where have we seen this trend towards fascism and ethnic cleansing before? I S R A E L. Establishing ethnostates in the middle of North America is neither realistic nor is it a genuine solution to the problems of capitalist exploitation and oppression of minority groups. If anything, it would end up making conditions worse for everyone, and make today\u2019s oppressed into tomorrow\u2019s oppressor. ","created_utc":1537318371,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Comrade_Zou_Rong","body":"I'm back from working today, so I have time to make a longer reply. I lost my post this morning, and only had time to make the briefest of summaries of what I wrote.\n\nAs per the last reply, there is very little worth replying to directly. However, this time I would like to take the reader (assuming there is one) into other areas, using StalinIII's text as a springboard, and no so much a polemic. I hope what I write might be interesting to some.\n\n&gt;The only person here who is not serious about armed struggle is the person ridiculing basic standards for security politics.\n\nWhile this is a blatantly ridiculous accusation, there is some wider truth to this within the North American \"Left,\" who have literally no use for internet security at all. Groups like MIM should be praised for their extensive use of internet security. The account \/u\/mimprisons has recently made a post encouraging the installation of TAIL OS, a security oriented Linux distribution. This kind of approach to communications is a good thing. I was in a group myself, one that I will not name, but was involved with an FBI raid. The US government wanted to knab them on material support of terrorism. Nothing came of it, and not because they couldn't prosecute them if they had wanted to. It was ultimately nothing more than a harassment tool, and the US government had no will or desire to fight it out in a court of law regarding \"freeze peach\" and supporting people they consider to be terrorists.\n\nThis lack of security consciousness is also an indictment against the seriousness of the North America \"Left,\" but is ultimately a reflection of First-Worldism, which takes great pains to operate within the realms of bourgeois legality (to use Lenin's phrase).\n\nThe flip side of this has been used as an attempt at discourse control. StalinIII isn't the first person calling themselves a \"Maoist\" to want to stop people from actually discussing what revolutionary violence looks like, and how to organize it. And this isn't a security issue, not for me anyway. I don't live in North America, and have no fear of the US government sending their agents across the planet to a country that is hostile to them.\n\nGranted, not everyone on the internet is in my situation, but there are plenty of reasonable precautions anyone can take to discuss potentially sensitive matters on the internet, if they want. Tor, VPNs, proxies, throw away email accounts, browsing in private mode, etc, etc, are all perfectly reasonable things to do, and will go a long, long way toward concealing your identity from all but the most dedicated opponents with access to large amounts of resources. And those people have better things to do with their time than to worry about \"Left\" revolutionaries inside North America, who are actually not a threat to them at all.\n\nSo to recap, nothing I have said has anything to do with \"ridiculing basic standards for security politics.\" The responsibility for security rests on individuals and\/or their organizations, not the people they send public messages to, and nothing I could say would change this fact. What I choose to say in no way violates anyone's \"security politics,\" and moreover, can not do so.\n\nWhat is instead happening here is an attempt at discourse control. This is a sensitive issue, but not why North American \"Maoists\" are saying it is. The US government doesn't fear a communist led rebellion anytime in the near future. This is because the US government is aware these people are almost completely under their ideological control. Why \"People's War\" is sensitive to discuss is because discussing this in a clear fashion can potentially disrupt these cults. \"People's War\" is a confessional signifier. It signals group loyal to a First-World pseudo-revolutionary ideology, and discussing it in a clear fashion causes these groups problems. Hence the need for discourse control in \"Left\" spaces around this issue, coming from the very people who claim to be upholding the necessity of it.\n\nAgain, this isn't unique to StalinIII, and anyone who has been part of the English-language \"revolutionary\" \"Left\" for long enough will know this is true. I could mention some names here, but there is no point in it.\n\n&gt;The implication here is that the US government doesn't have the capability to surveil every citizen, only those who are the biggest threats.\n\nThis is actually true, and also why they pay no attention to \"Maoist\" groups. The biggest internal security threats to the US government come from White Nationalist organizations; people who read the Turner Diaries and want to LARP as Earl Turner. A competing ideological threat comes from the Sovereign Citizen Movement (SCM), but while White Nationalists compete with the SCM for the same base of recruits (Euro-Americans, though the SCM has been able to recruit from other populations), the SCM phenomenon is a sort of ideological copy of \"America.\" It sets itself up as the *real* \"American\" idea, versus a counterfeit one that is currently ruling over the people. In that regard, it shares a lot of similarities with the people who did the Grand Mosque Seizure in Saudia Arabia decades ago. They were trying to out-Islam the Saudi government, and the SCM is doing something similar here. Hence this movement has caused the US government the greatest amount of random, undirected violence at law enforcement and other government (usually court) officials. It has also produced a lot of other activity the US government absolutely hates, but which couldn't really be labeled as \"violence\" per se. Still, the highest potential for organized, military style violence comes from White Nationalism.\n\n\"Maoists\" in North America are not even on their radar.\n\n&gt;The Third Worldist clearly does not plan on being a part of any movement that meets this criteria and is in turn not talking about revolution.\n\nAs there is no potential for revolution in North America, it would be foolish for a Third Worldist to join any movement claiming to want to bring about such a thing. However, that does not mean Third Worldists should abstain from violence. Violence, particularly selectively targeted violence, could bring about all kinds of positive outcomes, as far as anti-imperialists are concerned.\n\nFor instance, if there existed a violent Third-Worldist movement inside the borders of North America, capable of killing any public figure who was not well protected (and I've got close enough to Congressman and Senators to blow them away, much less minor celebrities and news personalities), then many people would think twice before ever advocating for war in a very public fashion (high profile Twitter accounts, going on television, etc). An organization with a few hundred people, who are not afraid of being caught or killed in such attempts, would be extremely useful at terrorizing many people into silence, when it comes to drumming up mass support for imperialist intervention (which is easy enough to do anyway).\n\nSuch a small organization might be able to prevent US imperialism from operating effectively, on the promise that famous people who openly advocate for it would need 24\/7 body guards to keep them alive. This type of small, armed and violent organization could potentially save hundreds of thousands of lives, and be very, very useful for protecting the *real masses* from imperialism.\n\nOf course, such an organization would not need to waste their time working for \"revolution\" amongst a population who almost totally reject it, and who would not benefit from it economically in any case.\n\n&gt;Third Worldist LARPers\/provocateurs think people should publicly divulge information about their illegal activities. Take a guess about the real reason why.\n\nHere the reader should be able to tell I have no where advocated for people to reveal their identities, though StalinIII thinks it is quite amusing to accuse me of being Jason Unruhe (this is doxxing behavior, though I can assure you I am not him, nor do I even like him or most of the things he says).\n\nThis is nothing but a transparent attempt at discourse control. StalinIII has switched \"discuss People's War in any fashion\" with \"reveal names of people doing illegal activities,\" where it is transparent no such implication was ever made. This should tell the reader volumes about the sincerity (or rather, lack there of) of StalinIII. I would say that, from my experience, almost all of them are actually in on this con-game though, and you shouldn't expect more than a handful of people who are sincere but have been caught up in a \"Maoist\" cult to be doing this.\n\n&gt;More Third Worldist contradictions: nobody in the First World is a human being with any worth or value because they are part of the global bourgeoisie and therefore sheep like consumers of imperialist propaganda, but they can spontaneously made to perform risky actions to funnel resources to other countries.\n\nThere is actually no contradiction here. It's simply a matter of numbers. There are always anomolous individuals who can be recruited to do violent things that are not in their objective class (or even life) interests. ISIS recruits petty-bourgeois Muslims to go blow themselves up in other countries. Marxist organizations have done this as well. There is no reason these people can't be found, and utilized in a similar fashion.\n\nThis is completely different from the tens of millions StalinIII thinks are waiting to be organized in a massive army. That's a fantasy.\n\n&gt;For some reason YOU haven't done so. Or have you? \n\nNotice who is actually expecting people to \"publicly divulge information about their illegal activities.\"\n\nBut to answer his question, I was expelled from my organization for violent activities. They wanted nothing to do with it. I never bothered joining a different First-World \"Left\" group, and decided to leave North America instead.\n\ncontinued below...","created_utc":1537352192,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"Comrade_Zou_Rong","body":"&gt;Or literally stupid enough to not understand that the diction chosen was purely legalistic language.\n\nSeems I struck a nerve!\n\nThe use of legalistic language here from StalinIII suggests a sort of pre-emptive defense in a bourgeois court.

The prosecutor will spring it on the court in some dramatic fashion, and ask him some questions like \"On such and such date, did you say \"Blah blah blah\" on a Reddit forum devoted to overthrowing the US government?\" And StalinIII is terrified of this possibility!\n\nAllow me to help calm his nerves. Should he ever find himself in this situation, he can have his defense quote me on this \"StalinIII and people like him are actually agents of US imperialism, knowingly or unknowingly, and have no intention of ever engaging in revolutionary violence against the US government.

But if I ask that, you\u2019re just going to lie and say you have read them despite the fact that you (very clearly) haven\u2019t. (I don\u2019t believe anyone could have honestly read Lenin and come out thinking the things you do unless they were completely incompetent [or dedicated eisegetes].) So I\u2019ll just say this: *continue* your study of Lenin in particular, and then move on to the others. They all offer invaluable experiences in the fight for socialism, even if you don\u2019t agree with them for whatever reason.\n\nI\u2019m not interested in talking to you, to be completely blunt, but let me show you where some of the roots of Leninism lie.\n\n[Engels\u2019s \u201cOn Authority,\u201d](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1872\/10\/authority.htm) in which he affirms the need for \u201cauthoritarianism\u201d in the revolution.\n\n&gt; Why do the anti-authoritarians not confine themselves to crying out against political authority, the state? All Socialists are agreed that the political state, and with it political authority, will disappear as a result of the coming social revolution, that is, that public functions will lose their political character and will be transformed into the simple administrative functions of watching over the true interests of society. But the anti-authoritarians demand that the political state be abolished at one stroke, even before the social conditions that gave birth to it have been destroyed. They demand that the first act of the social revolution shall be the abolition of authority. Have these gentlemen ever seen a revolution? A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon \u2014 authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois? Should we not, on the contrary, reproach it for not having used it freely enough?\n\n[The Communist Manifesto, Chapter 2](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/ch02.htm)\n\n&gt;The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, *by degree* [emphasis mine], all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.\n\n&gt;Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production.\n\n&gt;These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.\n\n[Engels\u2019s correspondence with Philipp Van Patten](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1883\/letters\/83_04_18.htm)\n\n&gt; Since 1845 Marx and I have held the view that one of the ultimate results of the future proletarian revolution will be the gradual dissolution of the political organisation known by the name of state. The main object of this organisation has always been to secure, by armed force, the economic oppression of the labouring majority by the minority which alone possesses wealth. With the disappearance of an exclusively wealth-possessing minority there also disappears the necessity for the power of armed oppression, or state power. At the same time, however, it was always our view that in order to attain this and the other far more important aims of the future social revolution, the working class must first take possession of the organised political power of the state and by its aid crush the resistance of the capitalist class and organise society anew. This is to be found already in The Communist Manifesto of 1847, Chapter II, conclusion.\n\n&gt;The anarchists put the thing upside down. They declare that the proletarian revolution must begin by doing away with the political organisation of the state. But after its victory the sole organisation which the proletariat finds already in existence is precisely the state. This state may require very considerable alterations before it can fulfil its new functions. But to destroy it at such a moment would be to destroy the only organism by means of which the victorious proletariat can assert its newly-conquered power, hold down its capitalist adversaries and carry out that economic revolution of society without which the whole victory must end in a new defeat and in a mass slaughter of the workers similar to those after the Paris Commune.\n\nFor good measure, here\u2019s [Engels talking about the abolition of private property in his \u201cPrinciples of Communism.\u201d](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/marx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm)\n\n&gt; \u2014 17 \u2014 \nWill it be possible for private property to be abolished at one stroke?\n\n&gt;No, no more than existing forces of production can at one stroke be multiplied to the extent necessary for the creation of a communal society.\nIn all probability, the proletarian revolution will transform existing society gradually and will be able to abolish private property only when the means of production are available in sufficient quantity.\n\nThese quotes usually clear up many of the more... egregious mistakes people make when \u201cinterpreting\u201d Marx and Engels (i.e., not actually reading what they said and relying on secondary sources that distort Marx and Engels for opportunistic reasons). It seemed to me that you may have had these conceptual issues, at least in some capacity.\n\nI\u2019m not really sure how to conclude this, except to say to be very wary about where you get your information. Again, I don\u2019t have any particular interest in discussing this with you. I just don\u2019t want you to go down a road of opportunism. There is, unfortunately, a much greater amount of falsehood about Marx and Engels than truth, and the same applies to Leninism.

Hang in there and buckle up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy education alone started to make me question everything, ranging from how society falters because of money and greed, how capitalism is literally unsustainable and will lead to our destruction within our lifetimes, how corrupt our republic has always been... so I became very involved with the 2016 election. Learning just what socialism, Bernie's demsocialism, and even communism was along with all the sub-theories (Leninism, Stalinism, Hoxahism, Maoism, etc.). In my spare time, I read some history books and watched documentaries from outside most of the western media's grasp, learning much of what we had been taught in our textbooks and media was misleading if not outright a lie. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWatched some documentaries on Cuba and figured out just how shitty the conditions were on the island before Castro kicked us out and how, despite him being portrayed as a dictator in the western media, is a hero to many Cubans who remained and didn't lose slaves or their businesses because of how well the conditions have improved. How communist countries like Cuba are portrayed as dirty and poor, but how they conveniently always leave out our sanctions and embargo on trade with socialist states. Read some leftist theory, read some books disproving how communists are all mass murderers, read about the U.S. and how our propaganda machine truly is unmatched, read about all the CIA's coups and sabotages of these socialist nations, how North Korea has been painted the bad guy but really isn't. It truly was like connecting all the dots and waking up from the Matrix for the first time. Realizing how wrong my entire fascist family and I was.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy earliest memory questioning communism was in high school years ago. I remember thinking how odd it was for our high school's history textbook (created in Texas, go figure) had not a chapter, not a section nor a page, but ONE PARAGRAPH for what communism was during the cold war and how \"millions died.\" That was it, nothing more. The sources in the back of the book lead me down the rabbit hole of lies and that's first when I started questioning things, but I hadn't completely connected the dots yet. It was only a half decade later I would learn how authors made up statistics for natural disasters in socialist countries, how people blatantly believed it and spread those lies until it became \"common knowledge\" in the west, how socialist leaders like Gorbachev worked with America's elite to bring about the collapse of the CCCP. It was truly a \"holy fucking shit\" moment.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think the hardest thing is realizing the truths, accepting you have ideologically become what people have been programmed to hate as a socialist\/communist\/Marxist and surviving in our hellish capitalistic materialistic world from that point on around all the idiocy and hypocrisy, but people have done it before we were even alive, so it's possible. The internet has truly enlightened our generation, allowed us to destroy the walls of ignorance our right wing governments have established. Because of this, you'll have a greater chance at survival if and when shit hits the fan. You'll know the warning signs and red flags. Educate yourself more. Mentally prepare for a collapse within the next couple decades. Establish friendships and try to find like-minded comrades.

As you said, you need to word hard and even if you hate it in order to earn money or gain skills that earn you money.  In reality the grind never ends unless you stop it. I have focused on finding a place in my community. I take pride in treating other people well, and in turn I get treated well. I have stopped thinking what I want to do with my life because that always leads to how one should obtain money. Instead I focus on what I can do right now, for my community, for my friends and me. No hobby or interest is useless if it makes you happy and life shouldn't just be about work and productivity. Don't force it, try something new! Live life now and try new things. Surround yourself with people you enjoy.\n\nI joined a left wing youth movement and it's full of really interesting and friendly people. I took time of work and focused on doing things my way.

WHOLLY STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES OPERATING IN:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1. Mapping services for national defense and security.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. Manufacture and sale of industrial explosives.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. Electricity distribution, national electricity system dispatching, management of electrical grids, multipurpose hydropower and nuclear power playing a significant role in socio-economic development, and national defense and security.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;4.

ENTERPRISES UNDERGOING PRIVATIZATION AND RESTRUCTURING OF WHICH THE STATE HOLDS AT LEAST 65% OF CHARTER CAPITAL, OPERATING IN:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1. Airport management and operation; airfield operation services.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. Air navigation services, aviation meteorological services  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. Large-scale mineral mining under current regulations of laws on classification of mineral mines.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;4. Gas exploration and extraction  \n&gt;  \n&gt;5. Financial and banking services (excluding insurance, securities, fund management companies, financial companies and financial leasing companies).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**III. ENTERPRISES UNDERGOING PRIVATIZATION AND RESTRUCTURING OF WHICH THE STATE HOLDS BETWEEN 50% AND 65% OF CHARTER CAPITAL, OPERATING IN:**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1. Manufacture of basic chemicals.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. Air transport services.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;3. Enterprises whose market share is of at least 30%, making contribution to the economic balance and market stability and operating in:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;a) Rice wholesaling;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;b) Petrol and oil leading importers.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;4. Cigarette manufacture.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;5. Telecommunications services having network infrastructure.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;6. Growth and processing of rubber and coffee in strategic regions, mountainous, isolated and remote areas with the purpose of national defense and security.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;7. Enterprises which are able to satisfy the essential demand for a rise in production, \u00a0and spiritual and material life of ethnic groups in mountainous, isolated and remote areas.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;8. Electricity retailing (conformable to the roadmap for formation and development of electricity market levels).\n\nNot only that, the degree of privatization you suggested is impossible without causing massive social upheaval. For one, it's impossible to sell off that much state assets without conflicting with the currently existing price controls (regulated by the Law on Prices). The economy will be sent into chaos, like what's currently happening in Venezuela - where price controls exist but the state does not have enough control over the commanding heights of the economy. Second, it'll conflict with the Vietnamese Constitution; Party members are also not allowed to advocate such a degree of privatization since it'll go against the Charter of CPV. In order for such a degree of privatization to take place, both the Constitution and the CPV's Charter will have to be modified to remove all references to socialism and state ownership of the commanding heights of the economy. In other words - a counter-revolution overthrowing the CPV and the socialist republic altogether. This is why the idea of a peaceful, gradual transition back to capitalism, in which people just wake up one day and find themselves living in a capitalist country is simply a fantasy\n\nThe alternative is to believe that the Constitution and the Party Charter is just there for fun - something you can't seriously argue. \n\nHaving said that, if the privatization plan I linked above gets carried out in its entirety, it would mark the first time Vietnam surpasses China in the degree of its market reforms. Perhaps it is the result of Vietnamese competition with China to attract foreign capital and ultimately replacing China's position in the global manufacturing chain. And it's not like I don't think this is a horrible idea, but this is **not** neoliberalism. Not yet. \n\nLuckily enough, the very article you've posted shows why it's likely that the privatization plan won't be carried out successfully:\n\n&gt;Prior to divesting its stakes in SOEs, the Vietnamese state first transfers ownership of key enterprises from the ministerial or provincial peoples committee level of governance to the SCIC, which then handles the sale of shares to private investors. Over the years, the process of transferring ownership from various ministries and committees has been a slow process. In most cases, ministries hold on to the SOE\u2019s, arguing that the enterprises are necessary for the local economy, while sometimes, ministries only prefer transferring failing enterprises. In few instances, the SCIC has hesitated to acquire ownerships of struggling enterprises. Since 2013, 173 enterprise out of 234 SOEs transferred to the SCIC have failed to complete the transfer due to delays. \n\nThe privatization plan is also signed prior to this incident regarding the re-nationalization of the port. Every wave of great changes needs a starting point. People may let it slide when it's the privatization of some state-owned beer companies. Selling off strategic enterprises isn't going to be that easy. There will be resistance, not only from the ministries, but also the workers affected by the privatization, as well as Vietnamese people in general whose livelihood depends on the state ownership of these industries.

{"author":"DrRakdos","body":"&gt;confronted with pragmatic problems\n\nSuch as what? If the issues you laid out later would be considered \"pragmatic\" then I disagree that those are either pragmatic or problematic. It showcases a lack of knowledge of history.\n\n&gt;what is the commonly agreed step by step policy\n\nIf you are a \"long time lurker\" then you should already know the answer to this \n\nThere is none. However this is not problematic. Capitalists themselves cannot agree upon the same issues communists can't agree upon. This is why there are different sects of both communists and capitalists. It is unrealistic to look at a economic and philosophical line of thought and think that there could ever be widespread consensus on any thing other than the end goal.\n\nAlso, if you're asking about the *why* someone ought believe in a thing, talking about the how to get there is irrelevant. One must look at the goal and idea itself. There can be one of several ways to get to the goal. The important part is the goal. Whether or not people agree on the how is irrelevant.\n\n&gt;what do you do with people who do not want to partake in the system\n\nThis showcases some ignorance in several different ways.\n\n1) how do you think capitalism came to be? It was not gumdrops and rainbows. It was a bloody mess. It was dirty. It was founded on the backs of serfs and their forced relocation. How do you think any system came to fruition? This is basic historical materialism- which further makes me doubt you are a \"long time lurker\". This is literally Marx 101. Dont blow wind up my ass, bud.\n\n2) what does capitalism do to the people who \"do not wish to participate\"? It isn't pretty. You starve. You are ridiculed. You are outcasted. You must leave your home and society. Often people will say \"well you can just go off and live on your own so therefore capitalism is grand!\" Wrong in so many ways. The only way one can leave capitalist society is by ... Leaving society? Hm. No problem there. And in a world where everything is property and everything is capital good luck just going off and using other people's resources and living on other people's land. That's how you get arrested. Which is what happens to people who do that \n\n3) people who ask this question usually always dont have a clue as to what communism is. \"WHAT IF I DONT WANT TO SHARE?\" Bullshit. Communism is clearly not what these people think it is. Why would anyone not want to live in a society where the fruits of their labor are their own, where you are justly compensated for your work by receiving a heavy social wage and not a measly pay from a fat cat boss who pockets the whole of your work. Why would anyone not want to participate in a society where \"to each according to his need, from each according to hid ability\" does not come to fruition? Only those who want to accumulate capital would want to do that. And those people are thieves. And thieves are punished.\n\n&gt;could I be a capitalist in a communist society\n\nWhat kind of bullshit question is that? Long time lurker my taint. Depends on what you mean by 'capitalist'. Do you mean \"someone who believes in capitalism\"? Then yes. Do you mean \"someone who owns means of production and uses it for commodity production and capital accumulation through wage labor?\" Fuck no. But, even if you wanted to, good luck convincing people to use something as meaningless as money and work hard in a place you arbitrarily own and take what they make and give them a fraction of what its worth and sell it for far more than what you paid to make it for some bloke to buy. The system makes no sense in a society that is classless and currencyless. It's a scam- and the scam is obvious when a communist society is in fruition.\n\n4) and again, this question is irrelevant in regard to the morality of communism or whether it is a system to be fought for and a goal to achieve. This is you trying to pull a \"aha something something violence therefore the system itself sucks\". The end justifies the means. And if you think capitalism is any different, take a look at the wars we fought in nations trying to break free from the shackles of oppression. Look at the serfs who suffered in europe during the transition from feudalism to capitalism. This is a problem with the tithes of history. It is not something intrinsic to communism or seperate from capitalism. If anything is human nature as the capitalist so often tries to weasel their way into saying capitalism is, then one thing about human nature is sure- historical materialism.","created_utc":1537489832,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"vngiapaganda","body":"I'll try to tackle these from a Marxist-Leninist perspective.\n\nFor 1: This doesn't exist at all for communists in the US or most of the West and there's no way to predict what that might look like if communists had any power to take any significant steps. Right now we're only struggling on an ideological level for many historical reasons, and it's not very clear that we have much of a role to play currently or for a while. For China, Vietnam, and Cuba - they lay it out in decisions made publicly at party congresses and other things like that. You'd have to go read those to get a good idea of what their step-by-step policy looks like.\n\nFor 2: I would recommend the book War and Revolution by Domenico Losurdo if you're up for some reading. Basically one of the arguments there is that \\*any\\* social system that has to go through a period of transition runs into issues of needing repressive measures. For instance, when the revolutionaries in the US came to power, they violently repressed pro-England colonists, including through mass killings. In the US when communism was on the rise, the government took harsh repressive measures on the movement up to and including extrajudicial killings. Once the new system is established, then things loosen up. In the USSR from the 60s-early 80s, there were plenty of people advocating capitalism but no one took it seriously enough for repressive measures (as long as they weren't working with foreign powers) because there was no serious threat - the place at the time was resolutely Marxist-Leninist at a deep level. You can read a book called Human Rights in the Soviet Union by Albert Szymanski for an honest portrayal of what human rights looked like in the USSR. Also, right now in China people can advocate capitalism fine in much the same way without being repressed, because the ideology of socialism with Chinese characteristics is firmly in place.\n\nAnother point Losurdo makes is that violence and killing in wars is seen as justified but in socialist revolutions, which can change the social system that creates the need for war, it is never seen as justified in the West. The narratives around nationalism and national interests are seen as valid but narratives around class and class interests are seen as horrible.\n\nAll that said, I think there are a lot of bad communists in the core, including ones that share my ideology, and I wouldn't blame you for having a bad opinion of them.","created_utc":1537490105,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

If the issues you laid out later would be considered \"pragmatic\" then I disagree that those are either pragmatic or problematic. It showcases a lack of knowledge of history.\n\nWell, from a sceptic point of view, history seems rife with such examples so I'm not sure what lack off historical knowledge you're talking about but let's discuss the rest of your message.\n\n&gt;*&gt; what is the commonly agreed step by step policy*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If you are a \"long time lurker\" then you should already know the answer to this  \n&gt;  \n&gt;There is none. \n\nWell, lurking has never allowed me to see one indeed.\n\n&gt;However this is not problematic. \n\nThis is the part I disagree with strongly but we'll get back to it in a few seconds.\n\n&gt;Capitalists themselves cannot agree upon the same issues communists can't agree upon. This is why there are different sects of both communists and capitalists.\n\nSure, I find this statement 100% reasonable.\n\n&gt; It is unrealistic to look at a economic and philosophical line of thought and think that there could ever be widespread consensus on any thing other than the end goal.\n\nAgain : 100% reasonable.\n\n&gt;Also, if you're asking about the *why* someone ought believe in a thing, talking about the how to get there is irrelevant. One must look at the goal and idea itself. There can be one of several ways to get to the goal. The important part is the goal. Whether or not people agree on the how is irrelevant.\n\nNow this I disagree with very much.\n\nWhen it comes to communism, the main difference is that it requires a much more important level of control over society and its resources (since they are to be collectivised and redistributed).\n\nGiven that, a system that concentrates a lot of power is much more in need of a plan that one that delegates a lot of power and autonomy to individuals. (we could argue this is communism vs capitalism but that's not my point. I'm reasoning in abstracto here.\n\nFrom a common sense point of view, if you put me in charge of myself, it is much less critical I have a plan on how to achieve my personal goals than if you put me in charge (with the same kind of power one has over himself) of 1 000 000 people.\n\nWhen communists distance themselves from specific self proclaimed communist countries that didn't succeed (to varying degrees), it is not the goal that was diffferent but the execution that went wrong.\n\nSo not having a plan is a major problem when aiming at a goal that requires very strong societal control and power over the individual (even if only temporarily).\n\nIf you disagree with what I write above can you help me understand your reasoning ?  \n\n\n(my message is too long I have to cut in two different comments, the next one will be below)","created_utc":1537527217,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"Alan_Sturbin","body":"**SECOND QUESTION**\n\n&gt;1. how do you think capitalism came to be? It was not gumdrops and rainbows. It was a bloody mess. It was dirty. It was founded on the backs of serfs and their forced relocation. How do you think any system came to fruition? This is basic historical materialism- which further makes me doubt you are a \"long time lurker\". This is literally Marx 101. Dont blow wind up my ass, bud.\n\nIt was for sure, we agree. But just as an observation, the historical trajectory was going from more brutal to less brutal. The example is a bit silly but it is estimated early humans in hunter gatherer societies had about 30% chances off being killed by another human. Now it is (much) less than 0,1%.\n\nGetting back to the first question, capitalism wasn't theorized, it just came to be, basically, which makes it very diffferent from communism in this regard. So there wasn't a plan indeed because there was no long term goal. But when you have a long term goal, plans are a must have.\n\nAnd when it comes to Marx, I did read the communist party's manifest and also read Das Kapital cover to cover (much more diffficult than the communist party's manifest by the way).\n\n&gt;2. what does capitalism do to the people who \"do not wish to participate\"? It isn't pretty. You starve. You are ridiculed. You are outcasted. You must leave your home and society. Often people will say \"well you can just go off and live on your own so therefore capitalism is grand!\" Wrong in so many ways. The only way one can leave capitalist society is by ... Leaving society? Hm. No problem there. And in a world where everything is property and everything is capital good luck just going off and using other people's resources and living on other people's land. That's how you get arrested. Which is what happens to people who do that\n\nYou make a partially fair point but let's say you own some land (the capitalist way, agreed), nothing prevents you from inviting 100 redditors from this sub to live of it and apply communist principle among people who are willing to. No one will get arrested for that.\n\nAlso, I find our current system somewhat oppressive in that it does have too much state with too much control over individuals already (permits to do this or that, taxes on this or that, obligations by law to build your house this or that very specific way, etc.). I don't know if you'll find it paradoxal or not but I think for example people should be allowed to renounce health insurance and state given rights in exchange for more legal and fiscal freedom. That way, non participation would be much freer than today for those who wish not to participate.\n\n&gt;3. people who ask this question usually always dont have a clue as to what communism is. \"WHAT IF I DONT WANT TO SHARE?\" Bullshit. Communism is clearly not what these people think it is. Why would anyone not want to live in a society where the fruits of their labor are their own, where you are justly compensated for your work by receiving a heavy social wage and not a measly pay from a fat cat boss who pockets the whole of your work. Why would anyone not want to participate in a society where \"to each according to his need, from each according to hid ability\" does not come to fruition? Only those who want to accumulate capital would want to do that. And those people are thieves. And thieves are punished.\n\na) When you write \"why would anyone not want to live in a society where the fruits of their labor are their own\" I would think you're talking about anything BUT communism.\n\nLet me explain and correct me on what I'm wrong about : under a communist regime, you and I work the same job. However, you happen to be more resilient than I am and when I decide to call it a day you stay one hour more. Or let's say you are simply more productive. I am under the impression that your pay and mine would be the same in a communist society.\n\nb) Other than this sentence, what you write does seems coherent to me from a communist point of view. However, when you write \"heavy social wage\", what I fear is that in a communist society the overall richness produced would be less (even if perhaps produced in a more humane way). Do you know of historical example that can bring weight to the idea of heavy social wages in communist systems ? (even if at small scale ?)\n\n&gt;Only those who want to accumulate capital would want to do that. And those people are thieves. And thieves are punished.\n\nThis shocks me a lot. Like A LOT. Please tell me if I am misunderstanding somehting or if indeed I would be one of the thieves you are talking about :\n\nToday, I enjoy photography which requires some gear that is complex to produce. My neighbor likes drawing and all he needs is paper and a pencil. In a communist society, how would this difference in superfluous needs be accounted for ?\n\nWould anyone who want to sail yachts and ride horses as leisure be able to simply by virtue off asking ? Wouldn't that be injust for people who have hobbies and aspirations that put much less strain on the collective ressources ?\n\nIf so, would someone who want to do something that is not provided by the collective and is willing to work more to be able to meet your definition of someone who wants to accumulate capital ?\n\nIf someone who like to do woodwork in their freetime build himselft a home made lathe and thanks to that is able to produce much more furniture to his liking, is he someone who accumulates capital ?\n\nOne of the thing that bothers me most with communism, and this is what I refer to \"practical\" aspects by the way, is that such real life examples are never adressed.\n\nA last one : I can perfectly live without a garden (it's a \"nice to have\") and I don't mind living in a small place. My neighbour is very sad not to have a garden and he feels a bit oppressed in his small place (those are \"must have\" for his psychological happyness). \"To each according his to his needs\" : he gets a garden and a bigger flat but I don't ?\n\nOne of my problems is that communism requires a level of selflessness I have never seen in anyone I have met (and I am not in a fat cat club, I mingle with people from varied horizons and social backgrounds).\n\nWhen you were anti-communist, did this bother you too ? If it doesn't anymore, what made you change your mind ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for your answers, I'm looking forward to reading them.","created_utc":1537527224,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

The fact that they are to be collectivized doesn't itself prove that one must \"have much more control on society\". Thats trying to prove your claim by just repeating it. Its an assertion of an assertion.\n\n&gt;concentrates it's power\n\nAre you implying communism concentrates it's power? How so? Our goal is to precisely destroy that very thing. Capitalism excerts far more power in the hands of the few. 6 people on earth right now have more wealth than 3.5 billion people. In what way, shape or form does workers owning the means of production equal more power than that?\n\n&gt;communist countries\n\nAnd here we begin to see that you don't know anything about communist theory. I would say ironic, but it isnt. It was exactly expected.\n\nThe concept of a communist country is itself contradictory as communism is a classless, stateless, currencyless society in which the means of production are controlled and distributed by the workers.\n\nThe countries people commonly (and wrongly) call communist were not communist, but socialist.\n\nAnd this leads me into dismantling the point you made further.\n\n&gt;distance themselves\n\nAnti communists often will use marxists terms laughably wrong. When they use them wrong and are corrected, as you just were, they will then try and say that it is a cop out of the communist to do that. It is logically absurd to use a term in an incorrecy way and then when corrected you try and pin the person to that definition. It is almost self serving.\n\nWhen communists correct anti communists in this regard they are absolutely not dodging, they are *claiming* it. Acknowledging the socialist countries for what they were falls perfectly in line with the marxist concept of historical materialism. The evolution of society and how they evolve to eventually lead into our ideal- communism. Taking the hardships of our forebears and wrongfully calling it some thing that it isn't robs the countries of their achievements and completely bypasses what is that we actually strive for.\n\nYou people are creating a problem that you want us to fall into and then when we dont fall into that category that you arbitrarily created for us you blame us for it rather than reassessing your beliefs and why we do not fall into that category.\n\nFor someone who claims to have done a bit of research you sure do struggle with marxism 101. Curious.\n\n&gt;common sense point of view\n\nA convenient cop out from those who lack good argumentative skills.\n\nCare to explain what is \"common sense point of view\" and how can one use it? This is just nonsensical pseudo intellectual jargon to sneak in a casual insult when you don't actually know what you're talking about.\n\n&gt;not having a plan is a major problem\n\nPlease quote me to when I ever said that we didnt have a plan.\n\nNever said that. Ever.\n\nI said the plan itself is seperate to why one should believe or strive for a things.\n\nThis is because we must assess the thing itself and see if it is worth striving for in the first place. You don't figure out how to get to capitalism until you first demonstrate capitalism is a thing to achieve. Neither with communism. The hows and ifs come later when trying to convince someone. Someone can have a clear and well thought out plan that necessarily leads to a plan, but that alone cant convince someone to believe or strive for that plan. My friend can give me a pragmatic and easy and realistic plan on how to get to some store 100 miles away. But... Why the fuck would I want to?\n\nSame with any ideological stand point or ideal.

Right now we're only struggling on an ideological level for many historical reasons, and it's not very clear that we have much of a role to play currently or for a while\n\nLike I said to OP regarding this, since communism requires shifting a lot of individual power to the collective, metaphorically it yield a lot of power over the individuals. And if you have a lot of power but no plan, it can lead to catastrophy quite easily.\n\n&gt;For China, Vietnam, and Cuba - they lay it out in decisions made publicly at party congresses and other things like that. You'd have to go read those to get a good idea of what their step-by-step policy looks like.\n\nThey have done so only after a quite long period of violence (but you adress that) and are not actually communist societies, no ? (China is actually pretty capitalist if you ask me)\n\n&gt;For 2: I would recommend the book War and Revolution by Domenico Losurdo if you're up for some reading. \n\nI'll give it a look (starting by reading about his stance and ideas more in detail and possibly reading the source material directly)\n\n&gt;Basically one of the arguments there is that \\*any\\* social system that has to go through a period of transition runs into issues of needing repressive measures. For instance, when the revolutionaries in the US came to power, they violently repressed pro-England colonists, including through mass killings. In the US when communism was on the rise, the government took harsh repressive measures on the movement up to and including extrajudicial killings.\n\nThat seems mostly true but only when it comes to significant and quick societal changes. Societies have changed quite a lot in Europe in the last decades without any such measure being needed because change was fast paced but made in very small steps.\n\n&gt; Once the new system is established, then things loosen up. In the USSR from the 60s-early 80s, there were plenty of people advocating capitalism but no one took it seriously enough for repressive measures (as long as they weren't working with foreign powers) because there was no serious threat - the place at the time was resolutely Marxist-Leninist at a deep level. \n\nNow this is very, very contrary to many accounts I have read or heard about... AFAIK, the most grave crime was political dissent.\n\n&gt;You can read a book called Human Rights in the Soviet Union by Albert Szymanski for an honest portrayal of what human rights looked like in the USSR. \n\nI will. Is it somewhat accepted as a non partisan book ?\n\n&gt;Also, right now in China people can advocate capitalism fine in much the same way without being repressed, because the ideology of socialism with Chinese characteristics is firmly in place.\n\nCan they advocate regime change ?

But it's still socialism because the capitalist forms are subordinated to a socialist planned economy in both cases.\n\n&gt;Now this is very, very contrary to many accounts I have read or heard about... AFAIK, the most grave crime was political dissent.\n\nThe Human Rights book I mentioned goes over this. It uses all sources acceptable to the West, so the evidence comes from UN reports, news from US or European countries, and such things. It's \"partisan\" in the sense that it's written as a defense of the USSR, but it exclusively uses sources acceptable in a generally \"non-partisan\" sense. There's really no non-partisan book on this issue, but this book does try to present as objective of an analysis as possible using accurate Western sources.\n\n&gt;Can they advocate regime change ? Criticism about Xi Jinping doesn't seem tolerated at all and looks heavily censored.\n\nThere isn't much criticism of Xi in general because everyone likes him, by all reports I've seen. You can advocate regime change to a degree but to what extent differs across the country. For instance, in Xinjiang, if you advocate splitting off from China using theological and nationalist justifications you can get into trouble. You can advocate for China adopt a republican system along the lines of the US, and many have. That only becomes a problem when you've got eg a student movement backed by US political forces like at Tienanmen Square or more recently with the umbrella thing in Hong Kong, where the students are pushed to confront the government and goad them into violence.","created_utc":1537533567,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"whatsunoftruth","body":"It's tiresome because every time we mention one of the Marxist-Leninist states, or a leader from these countries, there just has to be at least 1 person asking whether the country is socialist, or whether X leader is revisionist. I'm not saying it's wrong to ask, but deep down people aren't actually that interested. These are the questions you would expect people to consider when discussing revisionism: When did revisionism emerge? Under what circumstances? What are the balance of forces in terms of class struggle under a revisionist state? How do we determine that without devolving into liberal conspiracy theories about the ulterior motives of individual figures in the party? What were the wider effects of revisionism on the socialist society in question? More specifically, how did revisionism change the way the economy is operated, and how do these changes manifest themselves in the superstructure (culture, media and the consciousness of the masses)? Most importantly, what are the remnants of proletarian power and socialist planning? How can we restore that to the level prior to the rise of revisionism?\n\nInstead of looking into these important issue, Western leftists just seem to want an easy answer based on a checklist of what constitutes socialism. If the country is not socialist (to them) or the leader is \"revisionist\", then the response is to pretend the country doesn't exist and let imperialists attack it to death. Or even worse, instead of just indifference, Western leftists give themselves the right to parrot CIA propaganda and call the leader \"fascist imperialist comprador monarch\" because \"well, they're not socialist now so we're allowed to do that\". There don't seem to be any genuine interest in concrete investigation of any sort.\n\nIt's also irrelevant, because you're merely discussing revisionist individuals, and not revisionism as a social phenomenon. What if Deng secretly supports the Cultural Revolution this whole time? What if Stalin is actually a crypto-revisionist? None of it matters because communist parties uphold democratic centralism. All Party members are expected to uphold the Party line, which is the line the majority of members supports. It's meaningless to talk about the personal beliefs of the Vietnamese State Chairman, what truly matters is whether the CPV is revisionist. Even if he's not personally a revisionist, Party discipline requires him to act in accordance with the revisionist Party line, regardless whether he agrees with it or not. This is not \"authoritarian\", it's actually a very good thing, and it's fortunate that Party discipline is still strong enough to hold the Party together. If the CPV was a \"horizontal\" organization that allows members to split into millions of tiny sects, there would never have been a Vietnamese revolution. The only people that recoil in horror at democratic centralism are white leftists, whose reactionary petit-bourgeois narcissism cause them to oppose any sort of discipline which forces them to act against their personal beliefs. In fact, the very idea that their personal principles, desires and \"passion\" could have an impact on political struggle is indicative of bourgeois liberalism.","created_utc":1537537632,"score":43,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"CamaradaBolivari","body":"I'd like to contribute to your post, as a fellow brazilian. First, I believe it is necessary for us to make things clear: Bolsonaro is a far-right politician, a reactionary, he's been able to gain support from many sectors of our society including some fascists, but he cannot be characterized as a fascist, doing so ends up blurring the real meaning of \"fascism\" and becomes a problem as to how we should deal with him and his supporters. \n\nMy analysis is that he is the fruit of two problems: the first being the international crisis that affected most of the world, the second being the failure of the social-democracy that lasted barely 10 years. Both of them are connected and cannot be understood separately, and their consequences are the unemployment (and underemployment) of over 13 million people, reduction of the purchase power of the population, budget cuts on public sectors like the medical and educational ones, and many others that end up creating even more problems, like an increase in violence etc. Most of Salnorabo's supporters are not fascists, but regular people that are rightfully angry with the failure of the previous governments on maintaining a (poorly and questionable) welfare state, the corruption and the overall failure of the system and its institutions. The problem is that, instead of the so-called left in Brazil to take this opportunity to create class consciousness, it is insisting on the idea that the elections are our main field of struggle and only through it we can change things for the better. Now, this is not an argument for an electoral abseenteism, but a criticism for all the currently existing movements and parties in Brazil. \n\nNow, in this election, the \"left\" is already calling for support to the \"lesser evil\" against Bonoro, and the two options being called are a developmentalist and the successor of Lula, in each election going even further to the right. What we should do is engage in popular movements, unions, student movements etc., and I believe that, as we lack a strong communist party in Brazil and a strong theoretical analysis of our own reality, we must join with others and create study groups aiming to create a solid movement, where we can answer questions like what about the lumpen that live on the favelas, what about the organized crime that has it's own logic on the favelas and, depending on the region, works as a protection to the community, what about the question of religion that has been so neglected by the left even knowing that most of the population is christian and could have a revolutionary approach, or about the question of nationality that has been so important in other places on the fight against imperialism but in our case we cannot define what is to be a Brazilian, and many other questions that are specific to our condition.\n\nOf course, I believe many of the things I've said you already know and have your own opinion (even if you agree or disagree with me), but I tried to give some other arguments for our international comrades to think about too.

We had a parliamentarian coup d'etat in 2016 and since then the military is slowly taking places in key posts of the state. This 2018 election is nothing but to give the coup leaders legitimacy to carry on an attack on the people with strong neoliberal policies that will demand a strong leadership to be taken.\n\nBolsonaro is a problem for everyone: although a neo-fascist type, leader in the opinion polls and likely to take the seat, ideal to implement harsh policies that are required by imperialism, he's also too 'loose' to control and as so as Donald Trump, he faces some important opposition in the bourgeoisie.\n\nIn my view, the national bourgeoisie is deeply divided about Bolsonaro, while many wise, long term thinking sectors of imperialism are against him. In their views, a crazy, uncontrolled Bolsonaro government will explode the already high class tensions in Brazil. That's why the military has been taking some key posts in the Executive and Judiciary system, as well with the ongoing intervention in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBut the brazilian left is yet trying too much to appease the right. The electoral campaign is depoliticized. The main leftist party refuses to denounce the coup and they try to present themselves as almost totally with the main program in 2014 that led them to their downfall.\n\nThe short term scenario seems to be the rise of the violence and repression led by a civil-military like constitutional-dictatorship in Brazil. The change will come from the power of the masses, not the election. But the ingredients are on the table.","created_utc":1537569322,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Comrade_Zou_Rong","body":"I'm reading over the document now, and it's about what you'd expect; a confessional piece disguised as an investigation, filled with as many anecdotes as the author(s) could possibly find, and devoid of any citations. This makes actually trying to find their source material quite difficult (most of it is probably in Hindi anyway, but I'm willing to wager they had a substantial amount of help from English-speaking Western comrades in producing this document, who would leave traces).\n\nFor instance, on page 9 of the document, it is stated:\n\n&gt;Multinational corporations (MNCs) entered China without restrictions. In 1982 there were 26,000,000 private companies in China, which grew to 58,000,000 by 1983.\n\nThis \"fact\" immediately sent up red flares in my mind. The translators of the document stated in the beginning there may be extra zeros here and there, suggesting anything they say could be a couple of orders of magnitude wrong. Perhaps they realized someone would look at this passage and go \"Wait a minute...\"\n\nThe statement strongly implies that these \"58,000,000\" private companies are all foreign companies doing business in China. One has to wonder where this figure comes from, as I couldn't locate it anywhere.\n\nHowever, according to the PRC's Ministry of Commerce, there were only 836,595 foreign enterprises in the year 2016. You don't need to be able to read Chinese to read the figures from their [Statistics on FDI in China ](http:\/\/images.mofcom.gov.cn\/wzs\/201611\/20161107131933879.pdf) report (literally \u4e2d\u56fd\u5916\u8d44\u7edf\u8ba1\uff09. They also have figures listed in the tables for the years 1982 and 1983, and it goes without saying it isn't \"26,000,000\" and \"58,000,000.\"\n\nI bring this up, because the simple fact is that most of these numbers can't be believed. Attempting to track down where the author(s) of this screed got these numbers from turned up nothing. If there is an English ghost writer (and I'm sure there is one), it doesn't appear they got this figure from any English languages sources. I am left to suppose it comes from some Hindi language source, or is just completely the invention of the author(s).\n\nIf the 'factual' information in this pamphlet is not only wrong, but completely unverifiable (there are no citations to anything), then what good is anything else they say? Mao said those who haven't investigated something have no right to speak about it, but that obviously hasn't stopped the author(s) of this document.\n\nThere is also the usual accusation, amounting to saying that trade in the \"imperialist system\" itself is evidence of the capitalist nature of China. To quote the author(s):\n\n&gt;The \u201cOpen Door\u201d policy and the 1st generation reforms allowed the imperialists to plunder the labour of the Chinese people. Multinational corporations received the facilities they wanted. The state\u2019s overall control over foreign trade was cancelled. The Chinese state granted permission to companies to manage foreign trade independently. **China  thus  became an  inseparable entity in  the imperialist world market by transforming itself into a market for imperialist goods and by opening doors to their investment.**\n\nThe idea here is clear: if you call yourself a socialist country, and participate in international trade, you are in league with the \"imperialist world market\" and are just another inseparable cog in the imperialist machine.\n\nThis sort of \"analysis\" is common amongst Western communist groups. Apparently, it is forbidden by some unquestionable doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, but yet this doctrine is never substantiated in any form, nor is there ever any appeal to authority in the form of Marx or Lenin.\n\nBut what would Lenin say about this? Well, more than you may think, because this is *exactly* the same sort of accusations that were being thrown at the young socialist state being led by Lenin. To quote him:\n\n&gt;**The entry of the socialist country into trade relations with capitalist countries is a most important factor ensuring our existence** in such a complex and absolutely exceptional situation.\n\n&gt;I have had occasion to observe a certain Spargo, an American social-chauvinist close to our Right Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, one of the leaders of the Second International and member of the American Socialist Party, a kind of American Alexinsky, and author of a number of anti-Bolshevik books, **who has reproached us\u2014and has quoted the fact as evidence of the complete collapse of communism\u2014for speaking of transactions with capitalist powers. He has written that he cannot imagine better proof of the complete collapse of communism and the break down of its programme.** I think that anybody who has given thought to the matter will say the reverse. **No better proof of the Russian Soviet Republic\u2019s material and moral victory over the capitalists of the whole world can be found than the fact that the powers that took up arms against us because of our terror and our entire system have been compelled, against their will, to enter into trade relations with us in the knowledge that by so doing they are strengthening us.** This might have been advanced as proof of the collapse of communism only if we had promised, with the forces of Russia alone, to transform the whole world, or had dreamed of doing so. However, we have never harboured such crazy ideas and have always said that our revolution will be victorious when it is supported by the workers of all lands. In fact, they went half-way in their support, for they weakened the hand raised against us, yet in doing so they were helping us.\n\n[Our Foreign and Domestic Position and Party Tasks](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/lenin\/works\/1920\/nov\/21.htm)\n\nThe parallels here could not be anymore striking. The same arguments used by an imperialist labor bureaucrat against the USSR nearly a century ago are being used by the author(s) of this document against China today! There is nothing in Marxism-Leninism that forbids a socialist country from trading with capitalist countries, even imperialist ones.\n\nMoreover, Lenin goes further and says it isn't the *duty* of the young socialist state to spread revolution around the world. On the contrary, it is the *duty* of the class-conscious workers of the imperialist states to support the socialist revolution of the USSR. This is in stark contrast to how the author(s) describes the ideas of the CPI-Maoist:\n\n&gt;Our party, the Communist Party of India (Maoist), is  relentlessly striving to exterminate imperialism from the earth, to install communism, and to unite the oppressed classes and masses. Our party leads them and shoulders the responsibility to fight alongside them.\n\nOne has to question exactly what it is the CPI-Maoist has actually done in their 'relentless striving' against imperialism. The formation of the CPI-Maoist has its roots in a rebellion in the Naxalbari region of West Bengal. Hence why they are often labeled Naxalites. Shortly after their formation, they had a real test for how they would choose to 'relentlessly' deal with imperialism, one experienced by the people who speak their same language, against the state of Pakistan. I'm of course referring to the Bangladesh Liberation War, something the ideological fathers of the CPI-Maoist denounced as \"Soviet Social-Imperialism.\" *And it was their own people dying in the hundreds of thousands to the murderous Pakistani state, supported by American weapons.*\n\nBeyond this, there is a confessional tone running throughout the document. Maoism in India, it seems, is just as much a religion as it is in the West, and hence there can be no question of certain assumptions. For instance, it is obvious to many observers that Marxism-Leninism in the oppressed nations of the world is an expression of nationalism. The nationalists of the oppressed nations are by default anti-imperialists, and gravitate to the most anti-imperialist ideas they can find. This has been (up to the last few decades) Marxism-Leninism. Before Mao called himself a communist, he was a young man that signed up for the army during the 1911 Xinhai anti-Qing revolution. Could national chauvinism have played any part in China's war against India in 1962? This is a fair question to consider for people who are not dogmatists, but those with a confessional faith about Mao's China could never let themselves entertain that possibility. Nehru also saw himself as 'relentlessly striving' against imperialism, but that didn't stop the CCP from embarrassing his government in front the world.\n\nGoing through this document line by line would take a tremendous amount of effort, effort that simply isn't worth engaging in. There are much better materials people can find if they want reliable information on the Chinese economy, and this document should be considered not only worthless in that regard, but completely suspect (a more dedicated person than I could probably re-trace their primary sources via careful word searches, but if this would reveal anything interesting or not, I'm not sure).\n\ncontinued...","created_utc":1537614010,"score":15,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"Comrade_Zou_Rong","body":"The user \/u\/logicpriest is correct to be skeptical of the timing. This isn't the first time in history Western \"Maoists\" have requested the generation of polemics from overseas groups, and will likely not be the last. Ideological penetration of these groups have been documented even *within* the Naxalite movement. To quote from a document put out by the CPI-Marxist:\n\n&gt;Imperialist Infiltration\n\n&gt;It is this dark side of imperialist infiltration into the naxalite movement that requires further highlighting. The recent episode of the vertical split in the S N Singh-led CPI(ML) have confirmed the facts already available. In mid-1984 the Provisional Central Committee led by S N Singh split down the middle with the Santosh Rana - Vaskar Nandy group and the faction led by S N Singh parting ways after a bitter inner quarrel. It is significant as the bankruptcy of naxalite politics once again surfaces sharply with mutual accusations of betrayal of Mao Zedong thought, softness to US imperialism and divisive movements being bandied about.\n\n&gt;**The S N Singh minority faction in its document** makes serious charges against Vaskar Nandy and company. \u201cIn our organisation also, **Nandy\u2019s close associates established contacts with a foreign voluntary agency and a native voluntary agency financed by Western monopoly capital, keeping it secret from the POC and the general secretary of the party, S N Singh.** They established contact with Rural Aid Consortium of Tagore Society which is financed by West European countries and the USA and with one Danish Organisation on the Plea of providing relief to the people of Gobiballabpur in West Bengal and some areas in Bihar. Lakhs of rupees were received for digging tanks, constructing school building opening a sewing training center and distributing chickens and cattle to the needy. It also came to our notice that money was being received by some of our leaders from the Lutheran Church. **When it came to light to the PCC members, an intense ideological struggle burst forth in the party on this issue.\u201d** (Our differences with Nandy-Rana group, PCC-CPI(ML), p. 29)\n\n&gt;It goes on to state: \u201cWe thoroughly investigated (among the cadres and people) in Gobiballapur and Bhargora, where relief work was carried on through money from the \u201cTagore Society\u201d, Rohtas Channpatia and Mushhari, where schools were built up by the Dabes, and party and doubted our bonafides \u2026 Several cadres have been exposed to these agencies.\u201d It concludes with the damming indictment: **\u201cIt does not require intelligence of a high order to find out why some of the former members of the PCC adopted particular policies on the question of caste, tribe, Assamese and non-Assamese.\u201d** Following a blind anti-Soviet line, Satyanarian Singh found out a few months before his death that the majority of his PCC members sided with Nandy and company in whitewashing its links with the imperialist funded voluntary agencies, most having been, corrupted with foreign money.\n\n[Naxalism Today: At an Ideological Deadend ](https:\/\/www.cpim.org\/marxist\/198501_marxist_naxalism_Prakash.htm)\n\nThis type of ideological infiltration by Western imperialist organizations into Naxalite movements is nothing new. No doubt if you wanted to *test* it, you could just pick an ideological issue to struggle online with Western \"Maoists\" about, and wait around for the CPI-Maoists or Jose Sison's group to write a polemic about it. Then this issue is pronounced dead; end of discussion (that is, at least *inside* the organizations of Western \"Maoism,\" where the ideological need for unity is bolstered by pronouncements from such organizations).","created_utc":1537614020,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

It is a publicly traded company run by the state that extracts the surplus value of labor and redirects that value to shareholders ([they pay hefty dividends to shareholders](https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=NYSE:CHL&amp;e=4112296&amp;tbm=fin&amp;biw=1481&amp;bih=772&amp;safe=active&amp;ssui=on#scso=_vVmmW7nCFYuc0gLavpz4BA1:0)), which you too can purchase on the Shanghai Stock Exchange or on the US stock exchange as an ADR.

{"author":"[deleted]","body":"The USSR was not a dictatorship and laws were enforced differently in different areas; anti-sodomy laws were still on the books in the Soviet Republics of Azerbaijan, Turkmenia, Uzbekistan, and Georgia since they had degrees of autonomy to enact their own laws.\n\nThe official Soviet stance at the time was that homosexuality was a disease that was very difficult or perhaps impossible to cure. Soviet medical expert Sereisky wrote in 1930: \"Soviet legislation does not recognize so-called crimes against morality. Our laws proceed from the principle of protection of society and therefore countenance punishment only in those instances when juveniles and minors are the objects of homosexual interest\". This reflects the progressive attitude the USSR had towards homosexuality, keeping in mind our knowledge of sexology was in its infancy at the time. Remember, it was only in 1975 the American Psychological Association ceased to regard homosexuality as a mental disorder.\n\nComrade Stalin's criminalization of homosexuality comes from Genrikh Yagoda who urged Stalin to enact a law against pederasty after the OGPU had conducted raids on circles of pederasts in Moscow and Leningrad. The authors made the conceptual leap from pederasty to homosexuality, but the intent of the law was to persecute rape and child abuse. The precise number of persons persecuted under Article 121 is estimated to be around 800-1000 a year - out of a population of two hundred million. Of course, the \"anti-Stalinist\" propaganda doesn't mention those salient facts.\n\n&gt;According to Russian lawyers, most convictions have indeed been under Article 121.2, 80 percent of cases being related to the involvement of minors up to 18 years of age (Ignatov, 1974). In an analysis of 130 convictions under Article 121 between 1985 and 1992, it was found that 74 percent of the accused were convicted under 121.2, of whom 20 percent were for rape using physical force, 8 percent for using threats, 52 percent for having sexual contact with minors and 2 and 18 percent, respectively, for exploiting the victims dependent or vulnerable status\n\n(Dyachenko, 1995).","created_utc":1537641390,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"[deleted]","body":"1). Uh yea.  Marx predicted that capitalism would necessarily revolutionize technology to keep its contradictions in check.  He also appreciated its ability to build up productive forces.\n\n2.). Capitalism is inherently exploitative and follows certain rules.  These rules lead to people starving and dieing in bullshit wars (WWI).  The workers took over after the bourgeois February revolution failed to stop this situation.  Additionally, profit seeking in the agrarian sector was causing famines and the capitalists were hoarding grain and burning peasant farms and using poor farm practices.  Collectivizing rapidly allowed the USSR to maintain good production going into WWII.  Lastly, ex-capitalists and fascists tried to overthrow or undermine the government.  Their plots were exposed\n\n3).  Not sure what you mean by this.  I think your assumption might be a bit off.  Capitalism is a perfect system if you own capital.\n\n4.). A number of reasons.  There\u2019s the obvious capitalist encirclement and infiltration, but the biggest thing was the reintroduction of markets and private property starting in 65 and accelerating in the 80s.  This introduced a serious contradiction which lead to the recreation of a bourgeois class that overthrew the governments with a fair amount of US help.\n\n5). Leftcoms and Marxist leninists argue about this.  Lefts maintain that because the USSR still had wages and commodities it was capitalist.  Marxist Leninist argue it was low communism or socialism because private property was eliminated and the proletariat was in charge.  Nobody disagrees about it matching fullcommunism.\n\n6.). Answered in 4, but revisionism.\n\n7.). Capitalists fighting it.\n\n8).  Opportunities yes.  Market choices?  That\u2019s a bourgeois freedom.  \n\n9).  That\u2019s the winning question isn\u2019t it?  The bottom line is we have to build up organs of power within the working class\n\n10.). Full communism is stateless, moneyless, and classless.  Socialism would look different depending on where it arrived from, but we can turn to NK, USSR, Cuba, etc to get an idea as compared to what they were before\n\nIf you\u2019re interested read the Communist Manifesto.

{"author":"-m_a_y_a-","body":"Someone else has already answered your questions so I won\u2019t repeat their answers, but since you asked us to tell you if your questions are informed by imperialist propaganda, I may as well do so, as well as adding a few points I think are important. \n\nQuestion #1 on capitalism giving us opportunities for success: this is just a baseless lie which you have been told all your life. Capitalism gives no opportunities for success for the global majority of people, who are living in some degree of poverty and are unable to obtain good education or employment. It only gives opportunities to privileged first worlders who can access high quality education and lucrative careers. \n\nQuestion #2: this is pure propaganda. Sure, land was taken from people who owned huge amounts of land they didn\u2019t need and given to those who were starving due to a lack of land, but no sane person would view this as unfair. No one was killed unless they committed a severe crime which was punishable by death. \n\nQuestion #8: people will have the opportunity to get a good education, pursue a career of their choosing, participate in hobbies and live in a comfortable home with their family. No one will get to choose between 50 brightly coloured brands of crisps or buy a mansion or a private swimming pool. \n\nQuestion #9: nobody knows yet. Well, the active communist organisations in third world nations such as the Philippines and India certainly know how they want communism to be established in their countries, but we first worlders don\u2019t have much of a clue because the communist movement here is frankly a mess. It\u2019s a question that will have to be answered much later on. \n\nQuestion #10: again, no one knows. Communists don\u2019t aim to predict the future or create a pre-imagined ideal society. We prefer to take things one step at a time and focus on building our movement rather than hypothesising about something we aren\u2019t really able to predict with any degree of certainty. \n\nAn additional point: the fact that, to you, the \u201ctrack record of capitalism seems more promising than that of communism\u201d shows how thoroughly you have been indoctrinated. I won\u2019t try to explain why here because it would take far much more time than I can afford to spend on this comment, but you\u2019ll realise it on your own as you read more and more socialist content. For now, try to discount anything and everything you\u2019ve ever been told about politics that isn\u2019t backed up by evidence. A history teacher told you Stalin killed 30 million people but didn\u2019t explain how or why in detail? Discount it. Everyone has always told you free markets are efficient but no one has ever explained exactly why? Discount it. Someone from an ex-Soviet country told you about how they had to wait 5 hours in a line for bread under communism? Discount it (don\u2019t be rude to them, of course, but don\u2019t treat their anecdotes as evidence of anything). Question everything you\u2019ve ever been told and you\u2019ll soon find that it\u2019s all lies. ","created_utc":1537653583,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"youngsteinbeck","body":"By your standard, the closest realization of socialism was China in the 1970's when it had one of, if not the lowest, rate of income equality in the world (according to the Gini Co-efficient). If equality is our only standard, it was virtually achieved in China, but there were still hundreds of millions living in 'extreme poverty.' Even in its revisionist periods, the Soviet Union had lower than global average growth rates while having the highest living standards (compared to countries at similar income levels) because an absolute majority of state profit was put back in society. This greater than average equality (and substantial prosperity with it) was clearly not enough, nor would 'total equality' (or zero surplus profit) have been better. To be clear, socialism is a synthesis of many factors (working class rule, central planning, intensive productivity growth, wage scaling, non-fractional full employment, comprehensive social welfare) of institutions, not a single value standard.\n\nIf you want an introductory, but dynamic analysis of 'Chinese market socialism,' I recommend reading [China's Regulatory State: A New Strategy for Globalization](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Chinas-Regulatory-State-Globalization-Political\/dp\/0801477433) (2011) by Roselyn Hseuh.","created_utc":1537716426,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"pandoras_hopes","body":"Apart from u\/Comradealat, the answers you\u2019re getting are not very useful. I\u2019ll try to do better.\n\nMarx actually said relatively little about what communism was, surprisingly, but much about what it was not, and much about the capitalism it defined itself against. It\u2019s worth bearing in mind communism is an ideal, just like capitalism: neither one seems like it might exist in its pure state. Think about how America is capitalist, yet there is so much that must be managed by the state. One imagines a purely capitalist state would implode in 5 minutes. I expect the same could be true of communism; they\u2019re ideals.\n\nSo what is the ideal? Basically, no state (central government telling you how to live), no class (everyone is regarded as equal, which we *say* we do in the West, but really we don\u2019t at all, obviously), no private property, and hence, no money. Sort of like when I set up a camp with my friends, we don\u2019t pay each other to do things, but I make a fire, one makes a tent, one finds food etc. Similarly communism wants a society of equal people, who don\u2019t waste effort (and make divisions between themselves) by making *money*, which in turn only benefits one person, but just turn their labour straight into actions which benefit everyone (remember the camp scenario). In the camp my interest is that the whole thing works: if my friends die, how do I get food if they\u2019re the food finder? In my capitalist house, I care about me, and as long as there\u2019s people to buy food etc from, what happens to other people doesn\u2019t bother me. In the camp we all own all our stuff and we all take care of it, we make decisions together, we have to work far less because we\u2019re all working for the same goal. That\u2019s ELI5 communism.\n\nThe reason people say it\u2019s never been implemented is because no one ever really tried to fulfil the *ideal* I mentioned. Bear in mind that all labels we apply are just labels, there\u2019s no set interpretation. Stalin abused communism for his own political gain, essentially making the population communist while keeping power for himself and the political classes, Cherry picking elements of communism that weakened the populace and made him a fascistic ruler. People called each other \u2018comrade\u2019 but there were clearly still divisions of power (terrifying, abused divisions; check out animal farm), and government dictatorship. Mao probably implemented more \u2018purely\u2019 communist elements, but had no intention of giving up power, which communism would require of him. Without a developed industry, he tried to make China \u2018leap forward\u2019 by aggressively developing one, purportedly with the goal of communism in mind, but the state still controlled that, and it caused the death of some 60 million people; probably more than Stalin. modern day China has private property, centralised government, engages in market capitalism etc, but it tries to govern in a more communist, localised  way (in theory). I could go on about Cuba and other communist countries, but you get the picture.\n\nSo communism has had relatively few real-world trials, and I would say almost none under the conditions it would need: an already developed basis of wealth and production, probably built during capitalism. I guess modern China is that, but as you can see, it\u2019s a long way from the pure ideal. Without already developed bases, It\u2019s very hard to share nothing around. Communism has often been abused for the sake of private power, and as an ideal, it arguably has less power to stop that abuse. But in the same way as \u2018communism\u2019 has never really happened, neither has pure capitalism, where there is only private wealth and no social network. So in the sense that no idea can every be practiced in a \u2018pure\u2019 state, communism never existed, but in the sense that examples have used communist ideals to push a society in that general direction, it has, although I would add that in communism\u2019s case, it has generally only happened in really unconducive circumstances and often by people who\u2019s real goal was not that close to the ideal.

They were ran by government bodies, and those government bodies were made up of those within communist parties. Saying that the trade amongst SSRs and Soviet bloc states are ran by \"the party\" is akin to saying that the american economy is ran by whatever party is in current leadership.

{"author":"youngsteinbeck","body":"I am genuinely confused by your response.\n\nI was trying to give a concrete and mainstream estimate of 'workers receiving the full value of their labor,' which was your standard. If every varying form of surplus value is produced and then spread evenly across the whole of society as a central use value (where income barely differs based on job, civil or state position, performance, knowledge), then the least amount of surplus value is made into surplus profit. It isn't pure socialism, but close to it.\n\nHow is equality not related to your standard?\n\nAgain, I'm confused by your response.\n\nThe U.S. growth and development from the 1950's to the 1970's, regardless of its 'protectionist' or 'semi-command economy' industrial origins, was contingent, and fundamentally, not sustainable because of diminishing profitability (Andrew Kliman's The Failure of Capitalist Production, 2011). The scale of state investment is more or less irrelevant. The better questions are: why is the rate of profit always diminishing, what are its global (inter-relational) effects in core, semi-peripheral, and peripheral countries, and what is a broader capitalist response to it?\n\n'Capitalism,' if you take Fernard Braudel's definition of it, and his 'long view' of it spanning centuries (and I'm going more by Giovanni Arrighi's writings; I haven't read Braudel closely yet), has practically never been free market. It always thrives in its corporate (or state protected, managed, or funded) periods, then profits diminish, then growth, then income, then financialization happens until periods of creative destruction, then product cycles, and then history repeats.\n\nState capitalism, to me at least, seems like a meaningless phrase unless you're referring to Soviet Russia in the 1920's. I'm not the most well read on the NEP.\n\nI think you need to understand socialism is not a clear negation of capitalism. There are many things left from one to the other, but they aren't reflections of each other. In a capitalist society, things are produced by way of an enterprise, either in competition with others or with a monopoly, to be sold. Things are produced so much, to make them cheap, they are actually overproduced. Things are produced to make a profit to the point where profit can't be made because money is either too concentrated among very few enterprises or too much is needed to maintain capital stock. In a socialist society, they are produced by way of a central plan, of the most tactical and visionary sections of workers representatives, who are not separated from who they represent by millions of dollars, who make broad plans to be mandated, deconstructed, reconstructed, voted on, re-voted on, and then managed through state and local organs of power. Things are produced to be enough, based on many criteria, but not profit. On top of this, a socialist society prizes and achieves what a capitalist society may also, such as extensive and intensive productivity growth, but it further prizes and achieves sustainable production, non-fractional full employment, wage scaling, permanent inter-generational welfare, equitable distribution, and above all, working class rule (things a capitalist society consistently fails to prize or achieve). This is a piece of what I think a socialist society strives to be, and what some have modestly achieved.","created_utc":1537729451,"score":7,"subreddit":"communism"}

I will venture to do the same.\n\n&gt; I was trying to give a concrete and mainstream estimate of 'workers receiving the full value of their labor,' which was your standard. If every varying form of surplus value is produced and then spread evenly across the whole of society as a central use value (where income barely differs based on job, civil or state position, performance, knowledge), then the least amount of surplus value is made into surplus profit. It isn't pure socialism, but close to it. \n\n**Part 1** - I think you did a good job. That's a fair statement and question. \n\nI think I understand what you're driving at. My understanding of your responses thus far, is summarized as such. If only X% (a small amount) of surplus value is capitalist profit and when the Gini coefficient (or other economic metrics) is at Y%, then the measured society is fractional socialism. Aka, socialism by degrees. Is that a fair but truncated representation of the above quoted text?\n\n**Part 2** - If I'm wrong in my understanding of your reply, or wrong about Part 1, please, stop, and explain further as the following is not applicable and the following is based on misunderstanding.\n\nMy understanding is that doctrine of surplus value is the corner-stone of Marx\u2019s economic theory. My stance is according the Marxist thought, that as long as the worker spends time working without remuneration, creating for the capitalist surplus value, the source of profit, the source of the wealth of the capitalist class, then no amount of equality or Gini coefficient matters, because at it's root, you've engaged in Capitalism.\n\nEven when the value of X is small, man\u2019s labor power still becomes a commodity. The wage-worker still sells his labor power to the owner of land, to the state, to factories and instruments of labor. Equality, simply doesn't factor into it. If an individual cannot subsist except by selling his labor power to a capitalist class, then it's not socialism. Not even a little bit.\n\n**Part 3** - \n\nBut, surely it's not all or nothing. Surely, nothing is so black and white. And yes, I agree. Which brings me back to... (still working)","created_utc":1537735216,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

There was mass starvation in large swathes of the USSR (not just Ukraine) and it was caused by a multiplicity of factors none of which was part of a calculated attempt at killing anyone. Incompetent communication, poor timing, a drought and widespread resistance to collectivization are what brought the inordinate number of deaths. Calling it \u201cHolodomor\u201d is a cheap, offensive and faulty way to try to subtly capitalize on the Holocaust without losing the \u201cUkrainian linguistic flavor\u201d, while trying to equate the USSR to Nazi Germany (a disgraceful trend) and disregard the fact that it was neither directed at nationalities nor something that affected only Ukrainians. Either way, kulaks caused a good portion of it themselves by destroying their grain, killing their livestock, etc. In this sense, if we are to excuse Stalin in terms of direct knowledge of the Ukrainian situation, of which he was given poor information, you may argue that some of the \"victims\" brought it upon themselves. Last time I checked, Jews never destroyed food or went on hunger strikes to protest Nazis keeping them in squalid conditions, so how shall Ukrainian nationalists reconcile this besides by acknowledging that they are largely down-playing and mythologizing the Holocaust by creating a direct comparison? Collectivization -as Privatization- was intended to affect the relationship people had to property (in this case land and agrarian assets) and in turn affect class dynamics. The idea was to deprive an entire social class of the means that allowed them to be part of that class, thus eliminating said social class. Most of the time, collectivization yields more desirable results, rarely undesirable results. Judging by Stalin\u2019s reaction to demographic studies later in the 30s he was less than pleased by the indirect and not sought after results of the collectivization program - keep in mind that he in fact was moderate on the position in contrast to the CPUSSR's strongly pro-collectivization stance.

All Socialists are agreed that the political state, and with it political authority, will disappear as a result of the coming social revolution, that is, that public functions will lose their political character and will be transformed into the simple administrative functions of watching over the true interests of society. But the anti-authoritarians demand that the political state be abolished at one stroke, even before the social conditions that gave birth to it have been destroyed. They demand that the first act of the social revolution shall be the abolition of authority. **Have these gentlemen ever seen a revolution?

{"author":"ProudML","body":"Authoritarian is an overused term by mostly ultra's. Communism is the lack of state and class, the idea of authoritarianism rising from this is just incomprehensible slander. State, regardless the dictatorship of capital or the dictatorship of the proletariat, will hold some authoritarian characteristics as the use of the state is the suppression of one class by another. Bourgeois democracy, which holds about as much democratic character as ancient slave society, *democracy for the slave-owners,* vs proletarian democracy, the democracy of a new form, which is the democratic will of the workers in a worker dominated state. There is no way to avoid this, even the anarchist societies had states in which they had to force their will upon the whole. Which bring me to Engels and his quote of:\n\n&gt;*\"A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon \u2014 authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois? Should we not, on the contrary, reproach it for not having used it freely enough?\"*\n\nThe calls of authoritarianism can be, mostly, ignored by those who truly do not understand the subject of class conflict, class struggle, or the different societies at which we have access to (Dictatorship of capital or dictatorship of the proletariat). The idea of \"pure\" democracy, of \"democracy for all\" is a bourgeois disguise that ignores the fact that you can not put the exploited class and the exploiter class on a equal playing field in society.\n\nThis comment isn't directed toward OP but more for those who think authoritarianism is any kind of real aspect of communist or socialist society.","created_utc":1537772444,"score":1,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"AmbiguousSalt","body":"Stalin has spoken on this. I will post what he said, and then post what I have to say.\n\n&gt; There is no, nor should there be, irreconcilable contrast between the individual and the collective, between the interests of the individual person and the interests of the collective. There should be no such contrast, because collectivism, socialism, does not deny, but combines individual interests with the interests of the collective. Socialism cannot abstract itself from individual interests. Socialist society alone can most fully satisfy these personal interests. More than that; socialist society alone can firmly safeguard the interests of the individual. In this sense there is no irreconcilable contrast between \"individualism\" and socialism. But can we deny the contrast between classes, between the propertied class, the capitalist class, and the toiling class, the proletarian class?\n\n&gt;On the one hand we have the propertied class which owns the banks, the factories, the mines, transport, the plantations in colonies. These people see nothing but their own interests, their striving after profits.\n\n&gt;They do not submit to the will of the collective; they strive to subordinate every collective to their will. On the other hand we have the class of the poor, the exploited class, which owns neither factories nor works, nor banks, which is compelled to live by selling its labour power to the capitalists which lacks the opportunity to satisfy its most elementary requirements. How can such opposite interests and strivings be reconciled? As far as I know, Roosevelt has not succeeded in finding the path of conciliation between these interests. And it is impossible, as experience has shown. Incidentally, you know the situation in the United States better than I do as I have never been there and I watch American affairs mainly from literature. But I have some experience in fighting for socialism, and this experience tells me that if Roosevelt makes a real attempt to satisfy the interests of the proletarian class at the expense of the capitalist class, the latter will put another president in his place. The capitalists will say: Presidents come and presidents go, but we go on forever; if this or that president does not protect our interests, we shall find another. What can the president oppose to the will of the capitalist class?\n\nThis is an excerpt from Stalin\u2019s [conversation with H. G. Wells](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/archive\/stalin\/works\/1934\/07\/23.htm), and it is quite illuminating.\n\nThe basic truth is that the only reason the antithesis between so-called \u201ccollectivism\u201d and \u201cindividualism\u201d exists is due to class society. In capitalist society, this can be seen in the form of bourgeois rhetoric. \u201cThe strong (bourgeois\/rich) should not be held down by the weak (proletarian\/poor)\u201d; \u201cthe individual should have the right to private property\u201d; etc. Basically, the bourgeoisie champion the individual and separate him\/her from society in order to justify their continued rule. If they\u2019ve \u201cworked harder than everyone else\u201d (ha!), they\u2019re \u201cgreat men,\u201d \u201crisk takers,\u201d \u201cjob creators,\u201d etc., then don\u2019t they, the few individuals, deserve more than the \u201ccollective?\u201d Why should the \u201cgreat individuals\u201d bow to the \u201cmediocre collective?\u201d etc.\n\nLet us consider Stalin\u2019s words. There is truth in them. How could it be the case that a society truly protects collective interests without also protecting individual interests? A collective is nothing but a collection of individuals. If individual interests, at a very basic level, contradict collective interests, then that\u2019s a clear-cut sign that your society is inherently contradictory. It\u2019s a class society.\n\nAs Stalin says, there should be no such contradiction. Communism is actually the *reconciling* of that contradiction, in which individual rights are protected, and they align with the collective. All people have the same rights. Thus, this contradiction between the \u201cindividual\u201d and the \u201ccollective\u201d disappears, as it could only be a result of class society.","created_utc":1537794112,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"predalienmack","body":"What a child-like argument, which is no surprise coming from an ancap considering your entire ideology is built on a fundamental misunderstanding of how capitalism functions (and not knowing that the state is a critical part of how capitalists protect their interests). \n\nYou do realize that literally billions of people around the world are communists, right? You talk about communism lacking appeal when you would have a hard time getting enough ancaps out of their basements to get a room full of them together in real life, while in every country in the world, you will find communists organizing in some capacity. \n\nAlso, of course communism is complex and isn\u2019t easy to understand without doing some reading and research! Attempting to change the very fabric of society and usher in a new system of production, distribution, and generally change how power is organized in society is not some simple task that you can lazily read a paragraph or two to really get a handle on. You would also be hard-pressed to find communists who simply think communism \u201cis the greatest thing ever.\u201d No system is perfect, and societal systems must adapt and change according to the conditions and challenges they face. Thinking the prospect of a society run by the working class instead of by capitalists as being pretty great is not an opinion people just one day come around to for the most part, but it does tend to come about when people do some real research on capitalism itself and experience its ills first hand. \n\nYou may see it as close-minded for people to not want to hear out arguments for capitalism (or the laughably imaginary anarcho-capitalism), but you must also understand what people who understand the capitalist system and are as a result critical of it see. Capitalism is a system built upon exploitation of workers all around the world - colonialism, imperialism, genocide, racism, sexism, war, and the general dehumanization of all non capitalists into tools to extract profit from society are manifestations of that continued desire to keep conditions ripe for workers to be exploited and to prevent workers from organizing properly to change the way society functions. The foundational ideas for communism come about after researching the very real flaws of capitalism, and as a result desiring a more equitable and just system to take its place. There are of course many approaches to how communism might come about and how capitalism will end, which is why there is a great diversity of opinion amongst communists, and why the road to communism differs based on the time, place, and general conditions the attempt is being made in.

{"author":"predalienmack","body":"That really depends on how you define individualism. Individualism is typically ideologically bound to liberalism and many forms of anarchism. It is a basis of a worldview that places personal interests over the interests of society and the majority of people (which is a very capitalist way to view the world and other people, which I\u2019m sure causes plenty of cognitive dissonance amongst anarchists). So in that sense, individualism and communism cannot coexist. However, no communist would deny that societies are made up of many individuals who have different material and psychological needs, and that living in a society that guarantees that one\u2019s basic physical needs are met, and living in a society which also gives more time and freedom to pursue personal interests that can fulfill psychological needs, is much more beneficial to the individual as well as the collective than living in a society where a few thousand ultra wealthy capitalists have far beyond their personal needs met, while most of society struggles to survive. So in that sense, communism is much more likely to meet the needs of the individual, but the needs of each individual person don\u2019t take priority over the health and gains of society as a whole, or the collective.

{"author":"infinitelyelastic","body":"Your frustration is fair, and honestly, correct. The economic discipline is flawed theoretically, and based on irrational assumptions: rational economic agents, existence of equilibriums, the dichotomy of prefect and imperfect markets. \n\nThis frustration in the field of economics is shared, and criticized. The lack of history, adequate assumptions, and concrete reality has led to the implementation of catastrophic policies. \n\nHowever, there are some good news. Since the financial collapse, some renowned, neoclassical and post-keynesians, economists have started to revise those assumptions, and to admit the inadequacies it suffers, theoretically and practically. Hence, the work of Picketty led to a huge conversion in the field. \n\nMoreover, these revisions and criticisms within the neo-classical and post-keynesian spheres still miss vital points: the importance of history, the process of production, the role of class struggle, competition as in \u201creal competitive markets\u201d, and so on. \n\nThese vital points are found and discussed heavily within the field of political economy. Where Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx began their analysis of capitalism. Their works is based on concrete realities based on history, class struggle, and societies. Thus, leading them to form a real picture of capitalism, which is a system of never-ending dynamics, classes, vicious competitions, and driven by profit. \n\nThere are several universities that adhere to the analysis of political economy, which can be refreshing and thought provoking, as its criticizes the blandness of neoclassical economics and provide a different approach to problems of our world. I recommend the book of Anwar Shaikh: Capitalism (2016, published by Oxford), and you can find his lectures on youtube; he criticizes the orthodox approach, and provides his theory and analysis in an amazing manner and ease.  David Harvey provides great analyses of current economic news, and delivers talks and events regularly. \n\nYou can begin from there. ","created_utc":1537820077,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}
{"author":"crimsonblade911","body":"For your question there is a *WHOLE LOT* to unpack. I would honestly recommend you to go to r\/socialism and r\/socialism101 subs and look at their side bars. The reason I say this is because many communist idealists (us the people in favor of it) more times than not will concede that one of the more realistic ways to build a genuine communist society is to begin with socialism. \n\nFirst socialize the means of production.\n\nGet everyone fed, housed, and healthcare. \n\nGet everyone educated. \n\nBegin to build you production forces by strategically collecting surplus in a way where it heps you automate. People who work more in this stage (under popular ideology) *can* take extra stuff compared to their work. The extra stuff is everything **not** required to sustain you.\n\nThere is currently enough productive force to feed everyone in the world, and enough homes to house everyone. We just need to take care of everyone, and empower\/educate the masses to work towards a common goal.\n\nOnce things move forward, people are strong, smart, and working enough, with planned infrastructure, the civilization evolves into communism. There is such a surplus of resources (through collective means and automation and infrastructure) that many could take what they want\/need without neededing to meritize it through their work. People are free to live a life of leisure and arts and discovery. Our sciences boom with all the newfound time to think. Our art gets really *really* good. And most crimes are dissolved by default, since everyone has what they need. We then can focus on the little things and just advancing.\n\nThats the gist. Not every view aligns with mine. Some people are more ideological and some more pragmatic. But ultimately, communism is the end goal to free the masses from the life of hard labor and for us to enjoy the fruits of our evolution.","created_utc":1537820250,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

Housing, healthcare and education are all free, as is a certain amount of food, so that nobody ever has to worry about being made homeless, going hungry, or getting too sick. The public transport system is pretty good, the streets are beautifully clean, and the whole vibe generally is pretty serene. I really like it as a city, it feels very tranquil and is just generally a nice place to be.\n\nOn the other hand, there are certainly some problems, most of which stem from the sanctions on the country. They can't import lawnmowers, for instance, so cutting the grass in public green spaces (of which there are a lot) has to be done painstakingly by hand. They can't import bitumen or industrial machinery so the roads outside the city center are a bit of a mess. They can't import fertilizer or agricultural equipment so while there is plenty of food, its not particularly high quality. They can't import construction equipment so building projects are very labour intensive. They can't import petrol so there aren't many cars. You get the idea.\n\nRegarding leaving the country, only a select few can, normally those who have had successful military careers. Most take this as an opportunity to cross the border into Dandong and pick up stuff they can't get back home. Heartbreakingly, the most brought back items from China are teddy bears, as the sanctions now extend to childrens' toys.\n\nAside from military personnel, there aren't many opportunities to leave the country. I met a North Korean Spanish teacher at a university in Pyongyang who had studied in Equatorial Guinea.

Even when a product here is manufactured primarily for export, there are always cheaper knockoff versions available. Everyone in China has a smart phone.\n\n&gt;Even small startups from the U.$. go to China to seek out manufacturing for their products, living off the super-profits of the Chinese laborers.\n\nAre you suggesting they should be paid First-World wages? Then they wouldn't come in the first place.\n\nImagine a socialist government that is having difficulties providing jobs for everyone. An outside firms wants to come in and setup shop, paying the workers higher wages than the government would be able to do. Do you let them? A dogmatist would say no, but if you left it up to the worker, they'd say yes.\n\n&gt;This is very different from producing a surplus, after providing for your own people, and trading it in a way that is advantageous to both countries.\n\nIf they pay the workers higher wages than the State can, it isn't any different.\n\nIn any case, this is all beside the point. The political economy of Third-Worldism sees entire populations as participating in the exploitation of Third-World labor. Outsourcing labor creates political problems at home, as the imperialist bourgeoisie chase after higher and higher profits, they cut into the ability of their populations to consume the surplus value that is actually generated. Every good labor aristocracy job converted into a mediocre labor aristocracy job is just another political problem for \"America\" waiting to happen.\n\nIf you imagine it is the duty of a socialist government to make sure all its workers are not (technically) exploited, this is nonsense. Workers in every society have to take care of their non-value producing populations, primarily the young and the elderly, but also people with disabilities and whatnot. It is most certainly the duty of socialist governments to move value around.\n\nAnd nothing can actually be done about worker exploitation by the capitalist-consumer populations, except a refusal to sell them anything at all. The problem for a socialist society here is that they will often pay higher rates for access to labor than what anyone in their own society is capable of. The labor of a Chinese fast food worker goes for about 16 RMB an hour here, but would fetch closer to 70 RMB an hour in \"America.\" It isn't the duty of a socialist government to keep the worker from being exploited, it is to negotiate as high as salary as the foreign businesses are willing to pay for the labor.\n\nThis is what makes FDI in countries like China different from what happened in South America. Anyone familiar with *Open Veins of Latin America* knows that, if unchecked, the imperialists will simply buy off a government, and force the workers to work in the most grueling conditions they can possibly get away with, in order to maximize surplus value extraction (and simultaneously, allow the consumers of such commodities to consume even more value).\n\nThis doesn't happen in China, because it isn't ruled by a comprador bourgeoisie with no connection or concern for their own people. China is a ruled by communists who take the ideology seriously, unlike Western liberals who wear it like a costume. The people here are nationalists (by design). In China, you can walk into a place of business and start directly agitating workers to join a union, and it is illegal for the company to throw you out.\n\nThis is an important distinction, one the imperialists absolutely hate. If the whole world operated this way, the amount of consumers in \"America\" would disappear quite quickly, with the imperialist bourgeoisie unable to do anything about it.","created_utc":1537914580,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

It begs the question against adherents of Marx\u2019s LTV, which states that the average quantity of unskilled labor time it takes to reproduce a good will determine its equilibrium price. Its monetary value essentially corresponds to this and varies from currency to currency, but the point is that socialists can do this just as well as capitalists can.\n\nAnother point of contention is that resources are allocated via economic planning. The Soviet Union had economic planning done by all of society, and so resources were allocated appropriately (in the vast majority of cases). It wasn\u2019t just a few people trying to figure it out by themselves; society itself participated in planning the economy. Because of this, resource allocation wasn\u2019t really a problem.\n\nAnother issue is that, in socialism, money will eventually wither away anyway. In the short term, the economic calculation problem would be an issue (were it not for the things I already mentioned), but in the long term, after the final victory of socialism and the achievement of superabundance, money will no longer serve any function in society.\n\nI think that\u2019s pretty much everything, but again, it has been a while since I researched this, so if I\u2019ve made any mistakes, I ask that knowledgeable comrades visiting this thread correct me.","created_utc":1537930887,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

They criticize Leninist states, but their criticisms often come from Western propaganda, or general ignorance of theory, or a complete lack of analysis of concrete material conditions. From my point of view, they seem to think that you have to have this totally \u201cpure\u201d socialism for it to actually be socialism, and they often conflate socialism with communism. A lot of their \u201ccriticisms\u201d often come out looking either very strange or very silly to me.\n\nMy problems with anarchists are similar, but at least anarchists have actually accomplished things. I think the anarchists are far too idealistic. For instance, how will it be possible to simply abolish the state either right after or very soon after the overthrow of the capitalists? The capitalists will inevitably try for restoration, and will also inevitably seek help from the international bourgeoisie. As long as imperialist capitalism exists, and as long as it is necessary for the proletariat to organize itself as a class to crush the resistance of the capitalists, I have no idea how they intend to abolish the state. I think the Marxist analysis of the state is correct: the state arises out of irreconcilable class conflict, and as long as class conflict exists, the state will exist. The state is not simply born from submission to arbitrary authority, or from the threat of violence, but instead has concrete material conditions that give birth to it. If the socioeconomic (mostly economic) conditions did not exist for the state to arise, why and how did it arise, and why does it still exist?\n\nTo be clear, the question specifically asked what issues we had with other ideological \u201ccamps,\u201d and I\u2019m not being arbitrarily sectarian.","created_utc":1537937052,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

Where did Sohn-Rethel replace the value theory?) which I think will require me to read his book.   \n\nAlright Prof.\n\nWhat makes the argument convincing?\nSohn-Rethel himself writes that, \"that a thesis of this nature cannot draw on factual evidence for its verification but must rely primarily on arguments of reason. So also does the Marxian theory of value and of surplus-value. The facts of history tell in its favour only when viewed in the light of the categories established by the Marxian analysis of the conditions that endow them with the historical reality of valid facts. Our theory is directly concerned only with questions of form, form of consciousness and form of social being, attempting to find their inner connection, a connection which, in turn, affects our understanding of human history.\" But even so to convince myself I had to fall back on the empirical fact of \"Greek miracle\"  (starting with Parmenides) occurring in conjunction with coinage, the absence of \"pure\" geometric theorems in ancient Egypt where measurement was still a matter of practical know-how and not theorising due to commodity production not organising the social being yet and so on.\n\nWhat makes it original? \nI found it mind blowing because I haven't encountered any studies even attempting to answer the question about the class character of science and technology (if you do know of some please do tell me). I am aware of the academic field of STS, but it is dominated by Social construction of technology (Wiebe Bijker, etc.), Latour's Actor network theory and so on. \n\nWhere does in (it) stand in remain (relation?) to other interpretations of Marx or even Marx himself? \nMarx himself never directly tackled the question of the place of science (except statements like the only true science being that of history carried along the lines of historical materialism) or the origin of conceptual mode of thought in the writings that I remember, though I maybe mistaken, so please do correct me. Are there other evaluations of science and technology and resultant technocracy in the Marxian tradition? there was a mention of Italian workerism in the review but I remain woefully ignorant as far as operaismo is concerned.\n\nSo there you have it, not a high grade assignment but the best I have to offer as of now.     \nalso prof.

{"author":"Marxematician","body":"There are a lot of assumptions that go into this, namely that markets perfectly allocate resources to maximizes everyone's happiness. People who already believe that idea then use this as an argument to show that a command economy could only match a market economy, at best. In practice, it could be much worse.\n\nPeople who consider themselves socialists have engaged in the argument on its own terms, for one reason or another, but I myself see no reason to do this. 'Free markets' are not a natural phenomenon. Capitalism isn't a fact of nature that is to be explained by some sort of equation, like the law of thermodynamics or something. Getting this through to people means debating the concepts on a more fundamental level, namely, utility theory itself.\n\nIf utility theory is not a model of economic behavior that makes any sense, then there is nothing that can be said about markets being good at anything, let alone perfect.\n\nBourgeois economists themselves long ago realized the theoretical pitfalls of assigning numerical values to the utils they imagine people get when they buy the things they do. If it is possible for a rich man to only get 0.00001 utils with the next dollar he spends, but it would be possible for a poor man to get 10 utils for that same dollar, obviously in a 'more perfect' world, you would want to take the dollar from the rich man and give it to the poor man. This would increase the total amount of utils generated by the economy.\n\nThis type of thought experiment drove certain economists into the idea of simply ranking utility, which is the concept you usually find espoused by various apologists for capitalism on the internet. Here the necessity to dump cardinal utility for ordinal utility theory speaks of nothing but an ideological need for the theory to justify capitalism as a living social practice, and transparently so. Having done anyway with assigning numerical value to utility, it is no longer possible to speak of taking the rich man's dollar to give the poor man many more utils than the rich man could possibly get with the same dollar. All one can do is simply list the preferences for commodities in the order of which they appear (nevermind the fact that it would be fairly trivial to create an equation from a sufficiently detailed list of rankings to reassign numerical values to the ranked objects).\n\nWith this much information, it should be possible for most people to see the thought experiment is contrived from the start, and there is no point in arguing about it on any other level.","created_utc":1537953952,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

I don't mean that in a negative way, academia has the whole weight of hegemony and attracts many brilliant people and dense terminology, so everyone has that shocking moment when they realize what is called \"philosophy\" is just poor dialectical materialism.\n\nBut all of these things are covered by Marx and in the debates since Marx within the anti-revisionist tradition. Marx of course was very familiar with Kant, but Sohnrethel's rejection of Hegel goes too far and ends up weakening his case. For example, while there is an explanation of Greek philosophy, the model does not explain very well how we got from Greek philosophy to Marxism nor does it account for non-Western philosophy. Whereas the Marxist tradition is concerned with the evolution of the mode of production, Sohnrethel ends up rejection both production and evolution and ends up with an initial revolution in exchange which is merely replicated until Kant\/Marx. I think the historical case is weak here as well, Greece and Rome were slave empires, money was only a secondary phenomenon and you have to really read blindly to miss their clear concern for slave revolution as the foundation of philosophy and ethics.\n\nFinally, I don't see a reason to look at this concept of science which combines Althusser's epistemology (really Engels') without going all the way. Either you pick Mandel and focus entirely on empirical validity or you go with Althusser and reject it, instead you have something prior to empiricism but also dependent on it for truth.\n\nMonopoly capitalism is simply a nonsensical concept,Anwar Shaikh covers this well enough. Now that you've broken with bourgeois philosophy, which will always give Sohnrethel a special place in your heart, I recommend returning to Marx and Engels and then the anti-revisionist tradition. Libcom is so dishonest that they are basically manipulating you into thinking that the debates over Marxism happened among a few white academics in the first world rather than among the millions of people of color who actually took up the mandle of world revolution. This ends up reflected in a half-assed Marxism which almost always rejects dialectical materialism for bourgeois idealism. ","created_utc":1537977085,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

China's Government operates state owned corporations ([China Mobile](https:\/\/www.chinamobileltd.com\/en\/ir\/reports\/ir2018.pdf), [Sinopec Group](http:\/\/www.sinopecgroup.com\/group\/en\/Resource\/pdf\/AnnualReport2015en.pdf), etc) as State owned Capitalist enterprises where the surplus value of the workers is withheld and paid to shareholders on various stock exchanges.

At this time, I think it's best not to pass judgement on the DPRK. I suspect they're Capitalist as well, but don't have the proof one way or another. One thing that has concerned me is on their official website, they espouse the \"lowest labor cost\" as a reason for doing business there. I digress.\n\nObviously, it is the stated goal of the Chinese government to transition to Communism, but certainly, they haven't embraced socialism and still are progressing through iterative forms of Capitalism.

{"author":"ProgressiveGOP","body":"First, I appreciate the reply. I am trying to wrap my brain around this, but I keep hitting obvious examples that do not seem to jive with Marxist literature. It's great to have these kinds of discussion, for myself, and hopefully others as well.\n\n&gt; There\u2019s no contradiction between Marx and surplus value being with held by society. He predicted we would need to to maintain and protect the system, pay for the administration, and expand production. Individual workers getting paid their full value is just utopian and individualistic. It echoes libertarianism.\n\nThat's just it, China's government isn't solely withholding surplus value for society or for maintaining the system, or administration and expanding production. If they were, I'd be arguing they're as close to Socialism as we've seen in the modern age and that workers are reviving full remuneration. Some surplus value must be retained, I get that.\n\nInstead, China is passing a large part of that surplus value to Capitalist shareholders. For several of the largest State Owned corporations, from the comfort of my chair, I can buy shares those companies and use my capital gain access to the wage laborers in China and the value they create. As a shareholder in several of those companies, I now have a right to vote on issues of how the company is managed via shareholder voting and proxy voting. If as a capitalist, I gain enough shares, I can influence how the workers perform their duties and by and large this happens regularly.\n\n&gt; You have to look at what class is dominant, not just the existence of forces because socialism emerges out of capitalism still stamped with the appearance of capitalism, not necessarily as an independent breaking point. Not that revolution won\u2019t be necessary, just that it\u2019s not a light switch.\n\nIf the CPC is run by the working class and there is no separate class, then why would there ever have to be a revolution against themselves?\n\n*Sidebar Edit: Nearly half of the worlds new billionaires every year come from China.*","created_utc":1537990450,"score":2,"subreddit":"communism"}

This leads to the planners having to calculate the demand of goods and services, which they tried, and failed because information was scarce for the government and by the time it reached the top it was outdated. In communist countries, a lot of times it happens that there is an over abundance of unsold goods in one part of the country but a shortage in another as planners cannot keep up with all the information related to supply and demand (an enterprise has to keep up with a lot less information, has less bureaucracy and can rely on prices for guidance).

But the anti-authoritarians demand that the political state be abolished at one stroke, even before the social conditions that gave birth to it have been destroyed. They demand that the first act of the social revolution shall be the abolition of authority. Have these gentlemen ever seen a revolution? A revolution is certainly the most authoritarian thing there is; it is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets and cannon \u2014 authoritarian means, if such there be at all; and if the victorious party does not want to have fought in vain, it must maintain this rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionists. Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed people against the bourgeois? Should we not, on the contrary, reproach it for not having used it freely enough?\nTherefore, either one of two things: either the anti-authoritarians don't know what they're talking about, in which case they are creating nothing but confusion; or they do know, and in that case they are betraying the movement of the proletariat.

{"author":"CelticComrade","body":"It\u2019s good we are acknowledging that there were economic problems. Despite all the good it did if you paint the USSR as if it was a perfect model then you are not helping the cause.\n\nHere are my thoughts.\n\n1. In Socialism everyone should be accountable including managers. It is their duty to not only manage but to *increase* efficiency, if they were lagging in this regard they should have been removed and replaced.\n2. Again, if they were truly accountable this shouldn\u2019t happen, at least on a large scale. It is also never a bad idea to give incentives for using new technology and increasing productivity [https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stakhanovite\\_movement](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stakhanovite_movement) (I know it\u2019s Wikipedia).\n3. The USSR was strained throughout its existence. This is the reason resources were stretched so much but of course increasing production is often a worthy investment, even if quotas are failed. (They managed to massively increase production during the early years with new technology!).\n4. This lack of quality is simply a knock-on effect from failing to innovate and increase production.\n5. I don\u2019t know the situation but why would they keep the prices so low? Price controls are meant to make necessities extremely cheap, replacement parts? Not so much.\n6. I have no idea on this one but again shouldn\u2019t it be up to the managers to reduce inefficiency including wasting resources?\n7. I know problems with distribution happened mostly in the later years but this was at least partly because of under-investment of transport infrastructure. This is more of a knock-on effect rather than anything else.\n8. Subsidizing some sectors actually makes sense as sometimes it can be a socially useful enterprise without being a profitable one.  That said, of course all factories should be well run and this means managers should have incentives to do well. If they don\u2019t they should be replaced.\n\nTwo related links for this subject:\n\n[http:\/\/www.invent-the-future.org\/2017\/11\/why-doesnt-the-soviet-union-exist-any-more-part-1-introduction\/](http:\/\/www.invent-the-future.org\/2017\/11\/why-doesnt-the-soviet-union-exist-any-more-part-1-introduction\/)\n\nr\/[https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/archive\/stalin\/works\/1951\/economic-problems\/index.htm](https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/archive\/stalin\/works\/1951\/economic-problems\/index.htm)","created_utc":1538041772,"score":12,"subreddit":"communism"}

What matters is who it is used by, and against whom. Who allows it, and who censors it. As soon as liberal hegemony was threatened, the facade was abandoned, and liberal discourse had to be deliberately enforced.  \n\nThe one lesson to take away, I think, is to not let this failure of a liberal promise become a socialist promise. Many people come into socialism because they are frustrated that real liberalism does not deliver on its idealist promises. They suddenly see socialism as a means to deliver on what liberalism failed to deliver. It's a trap. It's about taking sides.  \n\nAnd there is no equivalency between censoring the fascists and pedophiles and all of the other reactionaries that infest this website and censoring communists, just as there is no equivalency between the violence of the opressors and the resistance of the oppressed, that is to say, one should not idealize the return to the fake ideal of free speech.  \n\nFC's days maybe counted. I'm not about to say that whatever helped a comrade evolve their political thinking is unimportant. But Reddit is also temporary. You should take with you whatever helped you along, without getting attached. I know several comrades which inhabited these boards at a time where the dominant political lines existent in this forum were a rare sight on the internet. That said, look how far it's all come.

A revolution requires a certain amount of centralization in order for it to remain secure against reactionary forces. The complete lack of a transitional period is nearly an impossible feat to accomplish, as something would have to replace the current state rather than structure vanishing completely.

It is the belief that the workers should own the means of production (whatever it is that allows them to produce their good or service) collectively amongst themselves. Once a society in which the workers own the means of production is established it can be called a communist society. This would bring about the abolition of state, currency and borders as they would no longer be necessary. However this cannot happen overnight just as the ancient Greeks didn't institute capitalism overnight. There has to be a period in which the state is run by the workers and the state owns the means of production. This is what socialism is. ","created_utc":1538122819,"score":3,"subreddit":"communism"}

The Soviet Union lasted over seventy years before being anti-democratically dissolved. China still exists after several decades, as do Cuba and the DPRK. As we Leninists gain experience, we become more proficient in the art of war. We constantly wage class war on the bourgeoisie and strive to repress them, to crush them in all their attempts at capitalist restoration. Leninists tend become more adept in their analyses, more knowledgeable in maintaining and building society, etc.\n\nAnarchists, after revolutions, have, in the past, *defied* the building of the dictatorship of the proletariat, have defied the new proletarian states. Why? Because they view the state as the root of basically all issues. It doesn\u2019t matter to them that the USSR, China, etc. survived (and still survive, save for the USSR) for as long as they did. Even though class conflict is not over, even though bourgeois restorationism must be harshly repressed, and even though the state now belongs to the proletariat, they insist that they are correct, that the state is not needed to mercilessly crush internal and external bourgeois influence.\n\nI\u2019m obviously a Leninist, so the anarchists, from my point of view, are emphatically in the wrong, and this has, in my view, also been borne out by historical evidence. I also don\u2019t think the anarchists who have succeeded in orchestrating revolutions have ever been able to actually dissolve the state.

{"author":"[deleted]","body":"&gt; I literally just googled it and hundreds of sources popped up. \n\nDid you inspect those sources?  Or did you just take their word for it?  Given the mass campaigns by United States before and after the war, nationalists in east Europe after the war, and Kruschev during the war, did it not occur to you to examine their methodology?  What counts as a death to Gulag?  What counts as an inhumanity?  Did you contextualize it with mortality of the general population?  With the prison systems elsewhere at that moment in history and before the revolution (for example the French labor camp system)?  What you'll find is that many natural deaths were ascribed to 'Gulag' as well as many deaths that happened after their release.  Using that same methodology, what would that say about the US prison system?  The death rate in Gulags was single digits and lower than the general population.  So I ask again, what source are you using that you would like to examine?  \n\n\n&gt; His actions also led to the death of approximately 6 million Ukrainians. In 1932-1933 due to an intentional famine. Look up \u201cHolodomor\u201d. It\u2019s been recognised by the Ukrainian government as a genocide.   \n\n\nThe holodomor was a famine, but it was not a genocide.  That's literally fascist propaganda reincarnated as Ukrainian nationalist propaganda.    \n\n\n[http:\/\/www.rationalrevolution.net\/special\/library\/tottlefraud.pdf](http:\/\/www.rationalrevolution.net\/special\/library\/tottlefraud.pdf) [https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B-eTgjCs2lzpQllPVzQ2UFd3aWM\/view](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/0B-eTgjCs2lzpQllPVzQ2UFd3aWM\/view)  \n\n\n&gt; Arguably increasing the repression of the working classes by replacing the capitalist ruling class with a political ruling class. \n\nThat's a complete misunderstanding for what the government is.  There is no political class.  A class is in the relationship to the means of production.  The government arises out of the economic base.  In the US, the government represents the capitalist class.  In the USSR, it represented the interests of the working classes.  The state wasn't repressing the 'working classes' in the USSR, it was repressing capitalists, former capitalists and fascists.  \n\n\n&gt;  Using violence to shut down political opponents, however awful those opponents are, is never justifiable. \n\nThat's a liberal argument and its false.  No one should be permitted to organize the removal of human rights.  All ideologies (including liberalism) will use violence against political opponents or they will be destroyed and replaced by political ideologies who will use violence against them unprovoked (like fascists whose ideology is that people who aren't their definition of white should just die).  Now go into a black neighborhood and tell them they shouldn't use violence to fight the KKK because that would be political violence and therefore bad.  \n\n\n&gt;  Your defence of violence to stop fascism is hypocritical and is a form of fascism. \n\nFascism isn't violence.  All ideologies use violence.  Is liberalism fascism because it uses police to break up political rallies?  Is liberalism fascism because it sent armies to defeat fascism in WWII?  You're engaged in a logical fallacy.  \n\n\n&gt; If you wish to stop dangerous political ideologies, rather than using violence and polarising people, incite a political discussion and they will lose all populist support.   \n\n\nUhhh... that's observably false.  I agree that violence should be defensive, not an attack, but I have seen no attacking violence in any organized fashion from the left in America.  What I don't agree with is the idea that fascists will just change their mind.  They have a vested interest in believing what they believe.  Allowing them to organize and just waiting until they commit a genocide to do something is what is dangerous, and the people who pay the price for that folly is the workers.    \n\n\nAgain, if someone is in your home saying they're going to murder and rape your family, your idea is to talk them out of it.  Our solution is to exercise authority to get them out of our home until they are no longer a danger.\n\n&amp;#x200B;","created_utc":1538230337,"score":5,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"MsExmusThrowAway","body":"I think it depends on what kind of therapy you're going to see. Western psychology is a lot different from eastern psychology, so if there's a cultural disconnect you're going to feel it.\n\nI went to therapy during my freshman year of university (it was free with my tuition). My therapist was a quintessential white\/bourgeois liberal who heavily laid on the moralism. For instance, she kept urging me to patch things up with my parents, and insisted I left home because I *lacked empathy* (because, apparently, the idea that brown people aren't all perfect angels or that internal contradictions exist in brown people cultures is complete blasphemy for a white liberal). I see that quite a lot with westerners actually: they demand everyone be empathetic 100% of the time (maybe I don't *want* to be empathetic towards everyone; maybe there's some people out there who don't *deserve* a smile on my face when I greet them), and if we're not, well, then there's something intrinsically wrong with us. And I think that's one thing wrong with therapists: instead of giving you the tools to fix yourself so you can better adapt to your situation and go about life smoothly, they demand on fixing you like you're a piece of clay in which they can just mold, and fall into resentment if they can't.","created_utc":1538270634,"score":4,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"Ajgp3ps","body":"So, this will be unsourced because I have neither the time nor will to be that much of a hero right now, but:\n\nBased on threads about those who have travelled China and asked Chinese people, along with me asking my Chinese friends, it seems there is an heir of optimism for China and that Xi is doing what is best for China. Also kinda from his books. There seems to be little negative thought, seeing him as a sensible and effective leader who is tackling a lot of the massive problems affecting Chinese people's quality of life and power over their lives. This notably includes corruption in high levels and at local neighbourhood levels. So think big government positions aiding corporate exploitation to teachers accepting bribes for favourable conditions. Then of course, areas such as environment, sovereignty, defence, China's position in the world etc.\n\nThis kinda answers the policy question too. Basically it's a domestic policy of cleaning up China, and in international policy of mutually beneficial relationships. \n\nPushing Left? Sure, in that he is reaffirming what they are supposed to have been doing. I think he recognises that the lure of capital has greatly impacted China in many areas, and is pushing the country onto a path of prosperity and beneficial living for all, rather than just those who can pay to run the country their behind the scenes. This is where the fact they are still socialist comes in. Capital rules the West. Capital will never rule China. The Party and the people rule China. \n\nOne of the reasons I support Xi is that CIA documents have long said he is uncorruptable in that he does not care about money. All he wanted was to rule China. And now he does...so all he wants is to make China great again...Basically the idea of what Trump is supposed to represent in the forwarding of america, that's what Xi actually is for China. I'm sure he probably has business ties, or at least his family. But realistically that will never dictate the rule of China. \n\nI should mention, many have stated (I share this opinion) that while Xi is currently good for China, he could now stay on longer than he is good. I believe he would likely hand over to a worthy successor when he feels he has accomplished certain goals, but of course there is always the possibility for things to turn out worse. Anyway... there is fear that the next ruler, or the one after that etc will have the power to stay on, despite being a terrible leader. \n\nSo, generally positive feelings, in my opinion for good reason. He pleases western leftists for his socialist leaning world polarity efforts. He pleases Chinese for building the 'Chinese dream' of national rejuvenation. \n\nAlso with his policy focus I feel the world has a chance to not collapse from climate change, so that's pretty cool. \n\nObviously you can find some stuff that's not great, though a lot of what I have seen has to do with markets more than specific policies. Ie gentrification in Tier 1 cities. But that's all another conversation. \n\nHope this helps. As I say, you can surely find all the stuff I talk about on r\/communism and related subs. Feel free to ask questions etc.","created_utc":1538337135,"score":19,"subreddit":"communism"}

The corruption of the party could have been ended in 89 and not within the last decade if the party had listened to protestors and purged many party members who had abused the system for their own political and economic gain. I'm glad these issues are being tackled now, but the protestors were not protesting for no reason. They had more insight to the functioning of the party than its members as they were able to observe the self-motivated actions of CPC members first hand. The fact is, it led Chairman Deng into a strong position for which I think China and the global communist effort ultimately benefitted, but the deaths and injuries of the protestors will forever be a stain upon the West's perception of communism and aside from the personal suffering on those who died or were injured or imprisoned in the protests, the whole global proletarian movement was set back amid rumours of inflammatory and false claims of so-called \"communist neo-stalinism\" by the capitalista set back worker's progress by decades.","created_utc":1538337781,"score":0,"subreddit":"communism"}

{"author":"whatsunoftruth","body":"So here's some context:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOver the last decade imperialists have constantly tried to stir up anti-China sentiments in Vietnam (not that different to how they stirred up anti-Russian sentiments in Eastern Europe). Realistically speaking, Vietnamese people have all the rights to be skeptical of China after what happened under Deng Xiaoping. The u.$ imperialists took advantage of this very real history to spread anti-China hysteria targeted at the Vietnamese comprador bourgeoisie and petit-bourgeois intelligentsia. The ultimate goal is to mobilize them to overthrow the socialist republic; and to set up a u.$ backed puppet regime.\n\nHave they achieved anything so far? Well, in some cases the more backwards sections of the masses unwittingly aided the efforts of the imperialists. And it doesn't help when the rightist faction in the Party does collude with the reactionaries. For example, there were incidents in which workers smashed Taiwanese or Chinese factories as a response to China's behavior in the South China Sea. Or very recently, there were violent protests over the SEZs - which the mouthpieces of u.$ imperialism depicted as a move to \"sell the country to China\".  Unfortunately, a number of farmers ended up joining these protests. That doesn't mean these protests have a mass base - in fact, that would be a completely different claim, and a very dangerous one. Workers and farmers did not flock to the side of reactionaries in large numbers - those who did were a small minority. Neither does it mean the masses bought into the imperialist propaganda that \"the Communists are Chinese puppets\". Some people were simply expressing their anger, in ways that accidentally played into the hands of the imperialists. In the case of workers smashing Chinese FDI factories, they thought they were playing their part in attacking China, and thus being patriotic. It does not in any way change the fact that these protests are:\n\n\\- Thoroughly reactionary in nature. After all, it makes no difference whether you are an accidental reactionary or an intentional one - although most of these protesters fall into the latter category.\n\n\\- Led by compradors.\n\n\\- Has a primarily comprador bourgeois - petit-bourgeois class character. Meaning the vast majority participants are enemies of the masses.\n\n\\- Funded by imperialists.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA common talking point of anti-communists in Vietnam is to claim that \"the commies sold our islands to China\". By \"our islands\", they are referring to the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands that are currently in dispute. The disputes however, aren't just between Vietnam and China, but also many other countries in the ASEAN region. The Johnson South Reef (known as \"\u0110\u00e1 G\u1ea1c Ma\" in Vietnamese) is part of the Spratly Islands - which, prior to 1988, was under Vietnamese control. After in a territorial dispute in 1988, Vietnam lost control of the reef, China has occupied it ever since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis book, \"G\u1ea1c Ma - V\u00f2ng Tr\u00f2n B\u1ea5t T\u1eed\" (The Johnson South Reef - The Immortal Circle) is a product of this larger wave of imperialist propaganda. Needless to say, it is straight up garbage, there's no analysis of any sort, and the entire book relied on unverifiable anecdotes (There was literally a story about a Politburo meeting that the author just pulled out of his ass). But more importantly, the book pushes the reactionary narrative that the Vietnamse Navy was heroic, but the Party did not allow them to fight back to protect the reef from China.  This perfectly aligns with the larger narrative that anti-communists were pushing - that the leaders of the CPV are \"Chinese puppets\", they're \"incapable of defending the country from Chinese colonialism\", and that we must \"overthrow the CPV and ally with the Free World\u2122  to protect ourselves from China\". The book was unsurprisingly, praised by the comprador traitors.  But the masses are not stupid, so people called it out. Veteran associations and grassroots patriotic organizations demanded that all copies book be withdrawn and destroyed. That the Vietnamese government did listen to their input is another case study of socialist democracy in action.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(Sorry it was so long, but this is reddit and I don't trust Western leftists to be rational.
