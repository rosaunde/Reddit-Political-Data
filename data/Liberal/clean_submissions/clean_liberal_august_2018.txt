I just had a few questions and I\u2019d love to hear from those on the other side of the aisle. To give a summary of who I am and my beliefs, I\u2019m a half White, half Hispanic libertarian-conservative. I believe that a small government gives people the most freedom and through that freedom, we can all thrive. I\u2019m also Catholic, so I believe in traditional marriage BUT I do believe gay marriage should be legal. I\u2019m also pro life and believe life should be protected from conception until natural death. I\u2019m a big supporter of clean energy and the environment. I\u2019m also a 2nd Amendment supporter. I graduated from a University of California school with a degree in sociology so I\u2019m pretty well versed in Marxist and more left leaning thinking. In fact studying those schools of thought made me solidify my conservative beliefs. I voted for President Trump and I like some of what he\u2019s done and I hate others. I also HATE his twitter feed.... it drives me insane.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. A couple of decades ago liberals and conservatives were able to respectfully talk with one another, but sadly I do not see that happen much today. Do you think there\u2019s a chance we can once again come together and talk politics? I\u2019m a firm believer that the United States is like the Bald Eagle, it cannot fly without the left or the right wing. She needs both.\n\n2. Do you believe that the mainstream media has some bias?\n\n3. Do you read the Constitution as a textualist\/originalist?\n\n4. Why do you think the Democratic Party is supporting socialism more and more?\n\n5. Do you have conservative friends and do you have respectful conversations with them?\n\n6. Do you listen to conservative thinkers to gain insight on conservative thought? For example, Ben Shapiro, Dennis Prager, Mark Levin, Milton Friedman, or others?\n\n7. Do you support the ever growing disdain for conservatives on US campuses? During my experiences at my university, and the countless videos and experiences I\u2019ve seen\/read about, it saddens me to see how much hate we receive.\n\n8. Do you believe in some conservative views?\n\n9. Can we be friends? A lot of my friends are liberal and I do value their opinions and I enjoy listening to their views. I honestly just want to be able to have these conversations without name-calling and spewing hate at one another.\n","subreddit":"Liberal","title":"Questions from a Conservative:"}

As some of you may know , a missing college student in Iowa was found dead, and was murdered by an undocumented immigrant. She was a friend of a friend who attends the same college as her , so this hit me especially hard. This was a young woman who had nothing but warmth and love to give, literally the type of girl Tom petty songs are about. And within hours of this heartbreaking news emerging, our commander in chief brought her up at a rally in W.V. and used this tragedy to justify a border wall. Mollie was a fucking democrat and now , when she can\u2019t speak out, Trump fox ect are using her for their own gain. I usually have very thick skin but this fucking broke me. \n\nA real commander in chief would be a healer and a leader in taking action to protect Americans . Trump used a horrific event to pull us as a country further apart along political and racial lines. This and trumps other hateful and divisive remarks are why we need to organize and vote before he does any more lasting damage to the social fabric of our country. Fox News joining in on this and using this tragedy to distract from earth shaking legal developments with Cohen and Manafort didn\u2019t help either. \n\nThis is not normal. \n\nThis is not ok.\n\nThis is not what America is, has , or will be. \n\nWe should be able to have reasonable and informed debate over immigration laws without full on fear mongering. I\u2019m a democrat but we need to have laws so that people don\u2019t get fucking murdered. \n\n\nWe need to make sure we never ever again let our politics become so toxic and tribal that we can\u2019t be torn apart by a cancer like trump again. Every second this prick spends trolling us is a second that problems in this country are not being solved. That\u2019s the stakes here, this shit is very very real. \n\n\nHave a reverence for how real and sick what trump is doing is.\n\nLove your fellow Americans and treat them with dignity.  Please don\u2019t feed the fire of anger , we are better than using a dead girl for political gain. Go out and vote and make a difference, then hug a Republican.

So today, I see one big problem in society that really makes me mad, and that is that if two people don't agree with each other, they can't still get along. Not only will they not be the best of friends, but one person will generally keep arguing their side even when it's not at all related to the subject at hand, and also regardless of whether or not they have good points. For example, I was talking with my friend one day about some light political stuff, and the topic of Trump's presidency came up. And I stated that I generally support his presidency, and left it at that. Now she obviously didn't because she kept bringing up reasons why he was a terrible person. I quickly respond with the fact that I don't support him because I think he's a good person, but because he's been fairly effective while in office (i.e. negotiations with Korea). Now she still continued to nag, and even started to put me down personally. So, back to the question part. I see that generally the people who actually like this are liberal, and im asking if that's what all of you are like, or if that's just the few I see in my life.","subreddit":"Liberal","title":"I have a question"}

{"author":"mumbalakumbala","created_utc":1535591716,"num_comments":3,"score":9,"selftext":"I keep thinking about what can I do to do some good in this world and make some positive change. I have a friend who managed to make an amazing impact by creating soccer in the streets in Atlanta. He gets kids (minorities and poor socio economic background) free and local soccer training by getting a soccer field on the roof of a local busy train station. https:\/\/www.soccerstreets.org\n\nThis has a lot of great results and he is doing a really positive impact. \n\nThis got me thinking, what can I do to help the world? I can\u2019t play soccer and I live in the border of a very rural area in Georgia. \n\nI\u2019m an immigrant, work in tech in a big company, work from home, make a pretty decent living, own my house, and all in all living the American dream. But every time I go to Walmart, Target, Starbucks, a local iHop, I keep seeing more and more cases of people that should be in retirement age but still work as they lost their pension in the 2008 financial crisis. I own an investment home in a more rural area, and my tenants seem to be living paycheck to paycheck. \n\nI decided to learn more about the life in rural America, that place where the so called Trump core lives, where you only see a lot of pickup trucks, guns, tattoos, teen moms, conspiracy theorists, confederate flags and a predominantly white population. \n\nThe real picture of course is not the cliche above, every time I talk to someone when I travel north, to places with population 200 and 30-40% living in poverty, and a median household income of $20,000 or less, when looking through the stereotypes I find genuine warm people who are just fed up with everything. Some don\u2019t even believe Trump would be able to change everything but for them it\u2019s a big up yours to the elites. Can\u2019t beat them, let\u2019s piss them off. And trump pisses us off. The post fact era needs to be looked at in a different way. It\u2019s not just choosing to believe trump and fox and friend because you are stupid, it\u2019s because other outlets are calling you stupid. It\u2019s a matter of stolen pride, of feeling defeated. There is no logic here. It\u2019s a big FU to the rest of us. This is why Trump won even though all the things that in any normal campaign would end a candidates political career forever. He was the only one who made them feel good about themselves and what they believe in. It doesn\u2019t matter if 100% of his policy is actually hurting them. It\u2019s a matter of lost pride. He is telling them they are right, that the coal jobs got lost due to stupid climate change nonsense form China, and they want to believe, he says they lost their jobs due to Mexicans and they want to believe because it\u2019s taking away the pain from the thought that there is no one to blame but the greedy financial institutions. \n\nLike any person they want a roof on their head, food, a sense of purpose, hope, a sense of belonging and pride. \n\nTrump gives them that. \n\nBut we can give them that too, the forgotten people that trump hugged repaid him by listening to and buying his (many times easily proven) false claims. \nPeople believe to people they like. Facts alone don\u2019t really help as people believe to what they want to believe and they will find evidence to support it just to feel good about themselves.\n\nSo here is my plan. I want to help the forgotten man and women of America with not just empty promises of a wall, or getting back coal mines to work. I want to help them adopt the changing economy and skill set. I want to help them as I think that no one really cares about them. We see them as a bunch of racist, science haters, Fox News watchers, religious fanatic losers that blame their problems on the wrong things. Many people look down on them. And they have no empathy, they are mostly white, not a monitory, not immigrants, they get no empathy from almost no one. But if I can generalize something as vague as \u201crural America\u201d, regardless of race or religion, I won\u2019t be needing a lot persuasion to claim they are one of the poorest demographic in the country. \n\nSo what do I suggest? Volunteering in rural America. I am pretty sure that if I offer a free or symbolic STEM camp after school in a poor southern SomethingVille with pop 300 and only a local hospital as the main employer with 90% trump voters, 60% high school grad rate and median income of 15k, I will be flooded in signups. \n\nKids learn science in school I assume in any public school but adding more fun after school STEM activities from someone with some different views can definitely help. Teaching kids about science which includes learning researching on their own, looking and several views, fact based debating, in a fun way can make a difference.\n\nAnother volunteer program I plan is teaching young adults who are interested in a career change to more modern skill sets. I can teach IT skills that don\u2019t need a bachelor degree. Most bootcamp programs are in the big cities and many are not aware or believe they can get into IT. I can teach programming, cloud, cyber security, and even AI and machine learning. I can get people prepared to online bootcamps, interview prep, finding outsourced work etc. there is a $4000 bachelor degree from university of the people I can help people prepare to and go through, and represent them and help them negotiate a job. It\u2019s not for everyone but at least I can help a few that don\u2019t know they have the talent for it to get a completely new career they never thought they will be great at. \n\nAlone I can\u2019t make a nation wide impact but with help from others this, with time, can make a real difference. It will make the change from within. \n\nWho\u2019s with me?","subreddit":"Liberal","title":"Ask \/r\/liberal - a simple idea to help change America from within, what do you think?"}
