Let me try to state it more clearly this time. ***Labor force participation is a bullshit statistic.*** It's a large number used to reinforce right-wing beliefs about welfare queens and lazy liberals. But when you break it down, the force of it dissipates. [Here's CNN Money's breakdown](http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/04/news/economy/donald-trump-94-million-people-out-of-work/index.html) of the 94 million out of work that Donald Trump was spewing last year:  \n&gt;**All Americans 16 years old and up**: 253.9 million  \n**Americans in the labor force with a job**: 152.1 million  \n**Americans in the labor force without a job**: 8.0 million  \nThat leaves 93.8 million Americans not in the labor force. But a lot of them are not in the labor force for understandable reasons.  \n44.0 million are **retired.**  \n15.3 million are **disabled.**  \n13.3 million are **taking care of a family member.**  \n13.2 million are **in college or job training.**  \nSo: of the **93.8 million** Americans not working, **85.8 million** are retired, disabled, taking care of a loved one, or in school.\nThat leaves 8 million people - what about them?  \n5.9 million Americans have **looked for a job in the past year OR want a job but have given up searching for over a year.**  \n2.1 million Americans are **in the shadows.** We don't know why they are not in the work force.  \n\nHere are some fact checkers explaining the statistic:  \n* 2013 [Politifact] (http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/30/blog-posting/are-90-million-americans-not-working-or-looking-wo/): \"Mostly false - 90 million Americans either aren't working or aren't looking for work\"  \n* 2014 [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/01/30/are-there-91-million-americans-on-the-sidelines-looking-for-work/?utm_term=.f083fa7777f6): 3 Pinocchios to Rep.

It doesn\u2019t seem to be hurting anyone except the profits of corporations. \n\nTo everyone asking: \u201cWhat about before the existence of net neutrality? The internet was still the internet and it functions the same way now as it did in 2014!\u201d \n\n\nIn 2007, Comcast started interfering with BitTorrent traffic on its network. \n\nIn January of 2008, the [FCC launched an investigation into the treatment of BitTorrent traffic by Comcast](https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/martins-big-ces-announcement) \n\nIn 2010, Google and Verizon, 2 of the biggest net neutrality opponents ([at the time](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060215/googles-stance-net-neutrality.asp) ), according to the same link, they won this case and the right to discriminate (reasonably against) some third party applications.\n\nFast forward to September of the following year where [the Federal Register publishes \u201cOpen Internet Rules\u201d - a set of rules created by the FCC to get rid of unreasonable discrimination on the internet](https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/quick-guide-upcoming-net-neutrality-rules-cha) . \n\n3 years later, this is the important part, May 13th 2014, the FCC releases a proposal that allows for the infamous [\u201cfast lanes and slow lanes\u201d ](https://www.publicknowledge.org/news-blog/blogs/how-the-fccs-proposed-fast-lanes-would-actually-work) for internet connectivity. \n\nThis is the issue, these fast lanes and slow lanes could reinforce vertical monopolies and ISP could steer their customers away from competitors. \n\nSo, basically, the FCC decides to let the public weigh in on their proposal and oh boy... here are the results from Wikipedia:\n\n\u201cJuly 15, 2014 \u2013 FCC opens up on Public Knowledge for public comments, received 1.1 million comments on the first day. Determined that \"less than 1% of comments were clearly opposed to net neutrality.\"\n\n\u201cSeptember 15, 2014 \u2013 FCC receives 3.7 million comments in total. \u201cThe FCC's server crashes again as millions more people, companies, and advocacy organizations weigh in on the open internet rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cFebruary 26, 2015 \u2013 FCC passes the Title II Net Neutrality Rules. \u201cIn a 3\u20132 party-line vote, the FCC passes open internet rules applying to both wired and wireless internet connections grounded in Title II authority.\u201d\n\nSo to finally answer the question of: \u201cWhat about before the existence of net neutrality? The internet was still the internet and it functions the same way now as it did in 2014!\u201d\n \nYou\u2019re right, the internet was the internet, but eventually companies, in order to maximize profits, started to alter the speeds of competition and other third party applications. Their relationships with lobbyists and government prompted the proposal of \u201cfast lanes and slow lanes\u201d and when the public was asked about the proposal, our response was a resounding \u201cno!\u201d. \n\nAgain, if the ISP didn\u2019t have a history of attempting to throttle our service, we wouldn\u2019t need net neutrality. But sadly they do, and the past speaks for itself. \n\nDon\u2019t believe they have a history? Check out this [list of violations and blatant discrimination ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=388863) \n\n[Netflix CEO Attacks Comcast Over Net Neutrality Issues](https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2403066,00.asp) \n\n[Groups Prepare to Fight AT&amp;T Over FaceTime Restrictions](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/fcc-facetime-att) \n\nHistory doesn\u2019t seem to agree with Ajit Pai.

{"author":"mpier","created_utc":1513740408,"num_comments":46,"score":99,"selftext":"So I come from a very conservative family, the kind that thinks America is currently doing great and headed in a wonderful direction because rebublicans are in power. All while not really seeming to know what's going on. They only get news from conservative news sources and literally think there is nothing worse than a liberal. I was having a political conversation with my mother yesterday and here is a sample of some of the things I said:\n\nWhen I told her the tax cuts aren't for her (she's middle class) but really only for the rich, she responded \"well if I were rich I would want a tax cut too, plus trickle down\"... It's hard to even respond, because she isn't rich so she's voting against her own interests and doesn't care. As long as the liberals aren't in power this is OK I guess? I've tried to explain that the economy benefits when people at the bottom are given access to more money because they actually spend it instead of banking it, too which she replies \"rich people worked hard for thier money and deserve to keep it\", sidestepping the argument. \n\nShes clearly bought into the anti-science, because she says \"science can't really prove anything for certain anyways\" so therefore doesn't believe in climate change or that vaccines don't cause autism (just 2 examples)... If there is 1 study that says the opposite of the facts, then \"we don't know for sure\"\n\nShe says liberals are just atheists and want to take God away from our country. I respomd to this by saying liberals only want to take God out of politics, and I get the classic \"we are a Christian nation and our founding fathers were Christians\" BS.\n\nShe doesn't want socialized Healthcare and doesn't want to raise the minimum wage because \"those people don't work hard enough and don't deserve it\" despite the fact that both would greatly benefit the country as a whole.\n\nIs it a lost cause, Im thinking it is. It just kills me inside that my own family has such little regard for what is real and true, and shows no concern for thier own interests as long as the liberals, whose policy would be in thier interests, aren't in power.\n\nShe has also blamed me being liberal on the fact that I went to college, as if my learning to think critically made me a worse person.\n\nIdk if this is a rant post or a question, but it feels good to get it out.\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your helpful and informative replies. I had no clue that I would get this kind of response, and it has been very reassuring knowing there are so many sensible people about there that give a damn. This really is a great community.

But if you ask \"what?\" they can usually list SC (his incredible feat getting a conservative justice approved by a conservative Congress) and \"tax reform\" (written and approved by a majority Republican Congress, merely signed by the President).  What else?  \"I don't have time to read all the papers and watch all the different networks -- I'm working two jobs!  When I get off work from the supermarket, I just have time to watch a half-hour of Fox News before I have to go to sleep to get up 6 AM to work at the coffee shop!  If I had more time, I know I could list a dozen great things he's accomplished!  I'm sure of it!\"\n\nAnd so, because of Twojobism, 25-30% of the US voting public believes not what the facts indicate, but what would most validate their emotions, and the US slides into the toilet of history.","subreddit":"Liberal","title":"#7 on my list of Top 10 American Political Evils: Twojobism"}
