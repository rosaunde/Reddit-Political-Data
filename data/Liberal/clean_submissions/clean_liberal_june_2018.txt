{"author":"Bruce24569","created_utc":1528354193,"num_comments":35,"score":14,"selftext":"I am a liberal gun owner, a former serviceman in the National Gaurd, and a hunter and outdoorsman(I eat what is killed, nothing wasted), and I dislike both sides of the mainstream argument about gun control because neither side knows a fuck what they're talking about.\n\nFirst, my side against mainstream pro-gun control. The US also has a terrible crime rate regardless what kind of weapon is used or if a weapon is used at all. Most of our crime problems, including gun crime, come from societal issues; some of the gun control measures are treating a symptom, not a cause. The Second Amendment was originally created in response to Shay's Rebellion. It is based off the idea that the citizens are the militia. A lot of people don't know this, but the states can actually draft people during a time of crisis. In the case of a natural disaster, insurrection, invasion, or any other instance when shit hits the fan, the loyal citizens will be able to fend for themselves and may be able to help suppress the enemy(if it's a case of insurrection or invasion). I doubt this is ever going to happen(except in natural disasters), but I'm mostly explaining the background behind it. Now, the problem I have with the mainstream gun control supporters people is that they're doing it totally wrong. They are attacking a specific type of weapon based on looks and its high-profile use in mass shootings, despite the fact that 97% of gun-related crimes, deaths, and injuries involve handguns. They also have zero knowledge of the weapon they are attacking, and I will leave this video here to explain it for me https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YjM9fcEzSJ0&amp;feature=youtu.be Now, if we're talking about banning bump stocks and certain features which can turn semi-autos into full-autos, or magazine capacity restrictions, then I'm on board with that, but low-capacity semi-autos should be legal to people who pass the requirements(which I'll explain further down). They also pull the \"but it works in the UK\/Australia\/Canada\/Japan\/insertothercountryhere\" without taking into account all the variables that exist when comparing countries. Then there's things like hunting, target-shooting and farming, but I doubt anyone would go that far.\n\nAnd now my side against the mainstream opposition to gun control. There's not enough enforcement of current laws, and some of the current laws are so lax that it does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them. It's that simple. The problem I have with the mainstream opposition to gun control is exactly the same as the mainstream support of gun control, just on the opposite end of the spectrum. They're doing it wrong. They make the same mistakes of comparing countries, notably Switzerland, Israel, Austria, and Finland. Yes Switzerland, Israel, Austria, and Finland have high civilian gun ownership, and they are legit assault rifles or semi-automatic rifles that were once military service rifles. The variables they fail to account for are that those rifles come with mandatory military training and are locked up in the house with one magazine of ammo on the premise that if the citizens were called up for defense of their country they would grab their rifle and go straight to the nearest military installation for more ammo and gear and to help fight the enemy. Just as the gun control support can't compare the US to the UK, Australia, Canada, or Japan, the gun control opposition people can't compare the US to Switzerland, Israel, Austria, or Finland either.\n\nMy take on it is this: Keep most current gun laws as they are, but standard shooting classes and licensing should be required just to own a gun. Also, ban on straw purchasing with legal penalties and make regulations for storing weapons with legal penalties if regulations are not followed. And ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines(more than 5 rounds for shotguns and more than 10 rounds for rifles). I can't compare the US to another country directly, but the Czech Republic has similar gun freedoms with shooting being the third most popular national sport. They have mandatory training and licensing for gun ownership, and have less gun crime and fewer mass shootings. We already require taking licenses for carry permits and hunting, so there should be absolutely no issue with licensing for ownership. Also, reinstate Operation Ceasefire and Project Exile(They cut down gun homicide by 2\/3 where they were put in place)\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Operation_Ceasefire\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Project_Exile","subreddit":"Liberal","title":"My thoughts on gun control"}

I have a disability called Optic Nerve Hypoplacia (Left eye is near sighted, right eye is lazy.) A lot of my college friends suggested me to get glasses believing that it would instantly fix my eye issues. \n\nNow there was one individual who started picking on me. He claims he was joking around, but I\u2019m pretty sure he was just taking advantage of the fact I was nice. So he started picking on me and I\u2019m like whatever because that\u2019s what friends do, but then it gets annoying.\n\nSo eventually I start messing with him back and his go-to was commenting on my eyes. I told him, \u201cPlease don\u2019t discuss that, I don\u2019t care for my weakness being brought up.\u201d That didn\u2019t stop him.

The dean put him on academic probation and he never bothered me again so all is fair.\n\nSo was his comments on my eyes considered hate speech? He was making fun of the fact I was worse off because he believed that I was using my eyes to get treatment and that\u2019s why I lacked glasses. \n\nIn truth, I probably had that coming. I would set up an appointment for mom to take me to the shop and either I\u2019d forget or shit would come up.\n\nTl;dr Guy bullied me over my eye didability.

Other states may have some version of it, too. In a nutshell, it\u2019s a discretionary spending program that pays 100% of tuition at any public, in-state college for any graduating high school student in Louisiana that meets certain criteria. Almost everyone I went to school with benefited from it.\n\n\nTo provide a few more details: \n\nCurrently the requirements for the base version of TOPS are a 2.5 GPA and an ACT score of 20. These criteria are subject to change at the legislature\u2019s discretion, but I can\u2019t remember them ever actually being raised or lowered. There is a more selective tier of the program that awards stipends to help offset the costs of room and board, books, etc, and a tier for lower grades\/scores that pays for community college or technical school. Students can also apply this award to in-state private universities (e.g. Tulane or Loyola of New Orleans), but instead of getting full tuition, they get the average cost of tuition of all public universities applied toward their private school. \n\n\nMy question is this: \n\nHow close is this to the \u201cfree college\u201d talking point that has become more and more common the last few years? If every state instituted this program would progressives be satisfied with that, or at least view it as a decent compromise?

{"author":"Incredulous_Donkey","created_utc":1530177119,"num_comments":8,"score":1,"selftext":"1. The Trump nominee will be seated. It will be a party line vote before the midterms.\n\n2. There was nothing unconstitutional about Republicans denying Garland a hearing. The constitution is not explicit on the matter. It's time to get over that.\n\n3. The Supreme Court has been right leaning for the last 45 years. They've thrown liberals a few bones with some big decisions over the decades, Roe v Wade, gay marriage, upholding Obamacare etc, but the reality is that the majority of their decisions have been conservative, especially the lower profile cases, and they have been quietly driving this country to the right for decades. That is the cold hard truth; liberals need to purge themselves of this fantasy that the Supreme Court has been good to them. It absolutely has not. And as for Anthony Kennedy, he was a center right judge who ruled with the conservatives most of the time. Stop romanticizing him and move on.\n\n4. The size of the Supreme Court is not set by the constitution. It is up to Congress. The Supreme Court size has been manipulated in the past; quite frequently in the 19th century. Famously FDR attempted to pack the court. Just the threat of court packing caused justices to flip and support his new deal programs.\n\n5. Our inane system of selecting Supreme Court justices is broken and quite frankly never worked that well in the first place. The framers gave justices lifetime appointments in an attempt to insulate the Supreme Court from the tides of partisan politics. This was a miscalculation. Almost immediately it became clear that the court would be as partisan as every other major government institution, but with the added exception of being especially undemocratic. And the court has only become more partisan in these hyper polarized times. It's time to let go of the fantasy that the court is somehow above partisan politics and that justices can interpret the constitution without the influence of their political biases; it's not and they can't.\n\nIn order for the court's ideological leanings to shift a justice of one politcal persuasion must die or step down while the other party holds the Presidency. As medicine has improved over the decades and centuries this scenario has occured less and less frequently. Earlier in the country's history it was at least somewhat common for a justice to die or retire due to health while the other party held the white house. However, in the last 45 years only Scalia has presented liberals such an opportunity. In accordance with our cockamamie system this should have been liberals' moment to realize a shift in the ideological balance of the court, the sort of shift that is supposed to happen every 20 to 30 years. The republicans very cynically took away that opportunity by disregarding convention, and completely ignoring the Garland nomination. Advancments in health care are only accelerating, and it will become increasing less likely that another Scalia type situation will happen in the future. If nothing is done on the part of the democrats, Republicans will very likely be cementing a conservative court for at least the next 45 years.\n\nLiberals, if you attempt to let this system run it's course as is, and wait around like good little boys and girls who always behave civilly and don't break with convention you will be very sorely disappointed. You will watch the direction of your country drift further and further right as the most important branch of government in modern times stays solidly conservative for decades and decades to come.\n\n6. This is not the time to wait, to be patient, to take the high road. If you attempt to take the high road this time you will see the foundations of the road you are walking on bulldozed under and replaced with the ideologies of those who do not have your best interest at heart. It's time to fight fire with fire. Stop reacting to republican dirty tricks and start acting one step ahead of them. This is a fight for your country and your livelihoods. You can't be too prideful and too scared to break with convention first. If we don't do what it takes to win, the republicans will; they've already proven that.\n\n7. The only constitutional solution to our current predicament is to win the House, Senate and Presidency in 2020, write a law increasing the size of the Supreme Court and pack it with at least 2 more liberal judges. We need to get the ball rolling on this immediately if we want to force action from our representatives in 2020, because God knows they'll take the easy way out and just do nothing if we let them.\n\n\n\n** Please spread the word about this.

Crt, but it is absolutely NOT OK to try and delay Trump's appointment. This is exactly what we complained about when Republicans blocked Obama's appointment of Merrick Garland. The goal shouldn't be to race to the bottom of our moral compass. Checks and balances only work if we agree to enforce them for everyone, not just people we agree with.\n\nAnd to those who are going to say \"but it's a mid-term election year, so we're just doing what McConnell did--waiting for the people to speak\"...no. McConnell trying to break the very system that protects our democracy isn't a justification for us to do the same. A midterm year is irrelevant to the authority of the president to appoint a justice. If we do this now, this will be the new normal. How long will it be until justices simply aren't appointed because one party is always obstructing? This is a slippery slope to a broken judiciary, which is the beginning of the end for any democracy.","subreddit":"Liberal","title":"Obstructing a Supreme Court justice appointment is NOT OK!"}
