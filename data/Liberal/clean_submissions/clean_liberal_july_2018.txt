We used to play video games together, watched some of the same shows, and both played Minecraft. ( yup I was that kid)\n\nThen came politics like a ship breaking apart icebergs in Antarctica. (We learned how to spice up sentences in English class this year.) We started to have some fights about politics blah blah blah. After that, we kind of became friends again but still knowing each other were always thinking about how \u201cwrong\u201d each other\u2019s political views were. Then came more politics. We had many arguments about which opinion was more \u201creasonable\u201d and which of us was in the wrong. Sometime in that he also accused me of trying to break his iPad which I responded: \u201cwhy would I want to break your iPad if I would have had to pay for it?\u201d He said: \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d (This accusation came from me dropping his iPad on a couch) I always had a feeling it wasn\u2019t about the iPad it was about being the victim.\n\nThen there was the awkward period. We kinda just pretended each other didn\u2019t exist for a few months. (Not passive aggressively but more like we had never met each other) (this lasted from about Halloween till after Christmas break)\n\nAfter that there was a time in, I think January where I overheard him say liberals were stupid so I went over to him and asked him if it meant I was stupid and he said yes. He also has called me stupid a few more times more recently.\n\nAlso the administration is very conservative and if I told them this story I would get detention. Also if I had called him stupid I would get detention.\n\nI am not someone who would take him calling me stupid personally but it makes me feel uncomfortable that I feel like I can\u2019t tell anyone in the administration or a guidance counselor.\n\nAlso sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes.\n\nEdit: yes this is a question.

Now assuming half of them were in favor of a UHC system that puts us at 30mil.\n\nEven if you want to halve that and say 15mil people are in favor of UHC that is still an enormous amount.\n\n15mil people would give significant buying power from insurance companies i would imagine. \n\nWith 15mil people paying into this same pot, why wouldnt a private program work? Why would you want the governemnt in charge?

So given how patient I was with the way he disrespected me, I deserved an apology and an admission that he could have handled things better. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe did agree, apologized, and admitted to his double-standards.  We then kinda went through a whole talk discussing his hypocrisy and his politics.  He admitted to his hypocrisy and told me how tough work is now because of his support for Trump.  He said he doesn't regret the vote, but Trump didn't do the things he promised, but still wants him to succeed. But he's not going to vote for him in 2020.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI then asked him to give me a list of reasons why he supports Trump and he couldn't.  He said that the way I questioned him angers him because I have a much better understanding of politics.  I told him that if he can't defend what he believes, then it's not worth defending, and that I just want him to have the facts in order to make an educated decision and not because I want to act superior. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe told me that after Trump became president, that basically he's drifted away from politics and we agreed to not talk about politics again. He asked me to hold him to it and I said I would.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI gave him one final recommendation in order to expand his knowledge of politics and at least see the other side of things and told him to watch the *\"David Pakman Show\"* which I believe to be one of the best political talk shows among the left sphere, and one that isn't emotional and has a very approachable layout.  He said he would look at it. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe then talked about other things and said we should hangout again. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt was certainly a difficult process, but forgiveness is something I believe in.  People make mistakes and change, and he was able to admit his wrong-doing and apologize.  Even though he's still ignorant of politics, he's aware of it.  I've seen documentaries of former Neo-Nazis and how they broke out of that mentality, and really it just takes compassion and not hatred. \n\nSo yeah, happy ending. \n\n**End of Update** \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI know this is long, but there's a lot to say on the matter. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, this is the good old story about politics and friendship.\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI knew my friend since I was in middle school and we've got a pretty close circle of friends that we drank and smoked till dawn with for years.  We've been through a lot of things and we've even worked together on an over-night shift, just the two of us, through the thick and thin of it all.  Ever since the election began, he came out as a Trump supporter and we all thought he was joking because that's the type of person he is.  He was very into the meme culture before it became synonymous with hate-speech and the alt-right. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDown the line, it became obvious that my friend's support was serious and it was starting to split our circle of friends apart.  When I worked with him, we'd argue politics and there was a night where we had a very heated debate where I dropped facts and statistics and rebuked all of his positions.  I really tried to understand why he supported the things he did, but his answer to it all was *\"leave me to my ignorance.\"*  I'm not even kidding.  That didn't compute with me.  But even so, we agreed to not talk about politics near each other again.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHowever, he still did or at least made remarks and political jokes in the store, and the store we worked at was basically Trump land, so that added to my nightmare.  He befriended a straight-up Neo-Nazi who advocated for Eugenics and some nihilist kid that just wanted to watch the world burn; that nihilist kid wasn't white, but he supported Trump, eugenics, and everything else.  It was very bizarre.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo my friend constantly told me how he loved \"trolling\" to get a rise out of people and on facebook he would post his views and links to propaganda sites, so I constantly challenged his viewpoints.  He took me off for \"marauding\", which is really hypocritical, but he said that we were still friends and we were.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWe still drank and had fun, but our friend circle split and we slowly drifted apart, and because I didn't work at the same store as him anymore, we just didn't contact each other. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI kinda understand why he voted for Trump, which is why I still reserve hope that he might reflect on his decision.  He has a very hard life and is unsatisfied with the world.  He has a kid, who's mother is a psycho and abusive bitch that doesn't hold a job and cheated on him, has a criminal record, yet holds custody over the kid.  He never finished high-school and holds 2 retail jobs.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEver since we drifted apart, I haven't talked to him for a year, but I kept thinking of the good old times and wanted to reconnect.  The last four years before the election were some of the best and most memorable. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne of my other best-friends still keeps in touch, and earlier today he tried to rebuild our friendship.  He made a post about it on Facebook asking for us to make up.  The Trump-supporter friend said he still wants to be friends.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe dilemma is that even though I still want to be his friend, on principle I cannot accept his part in the election of such a horrible President, especially after I dispelled his views in a factual manner, without acting morally superior.  And honestly, I would have forgiven him maybe a week ago, but now with the Supreme Court Justice situation, it's like I don't know if I should forgive you.  You reap what you sow.  We're already seeing ramifications that will be multi-generational, and this is only the second year.  I would probably forgive him if he no longer supported Trump, but I have a feeling he still does. \n\nHe's a nice guy, works hard, and helps his friends, and the only real negative thing I can say about him is his political ideology.  But if I had said the same thing about a Nazi, he would still be a Nazi that advocated for killing Jews.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThomas Jefferson once said: *\"I never considered a difference of opinion in politics, in religion, in philosophy, as cause for withdrawing from a friend.\"*\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHowever, even Jefferson didn't speak to John Adams for 12 years because of a political disagreement.  But their disagreement was a noble one, a disagreement about how involved a government should be. \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe disagreement I have with my friend is about the establishment of a near-fascist regime that is actively destroying civil liberties and the environment. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo what would you recommend I do in this situation?  Should look past his ideology and accept the invitation to rekindle our friendship, or reject it?  If I do reject it, I would look bad to my other friend who initiated this attempt at a resolution. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TL:DR** One of my oldest and closest friends is a Trump supporter.  We stopped talking for over a year because of our disagreements.  My other friend wants us to rebuild our friendship and he said that he still considers me his friend.  I want to be his friend too, but because of my strong principles, I'm not sure if I can accept.

{"author":"victoriaconcordia","created_utc":1531953857,"num_comments":2,"score":1,"selftext":"I've been looking at recent polls, and seeing that Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders seem to be topping a lot of Democratic polling. For the life of me, I cannot understand why Democrats would want any of these three to win. First of all, the youngest among them, Warren, would be 72 at the time of her inauguration. It is clear that we need a fresher, younger face than any of these 3. I'll list the problems with them one by one, in my opinion.\nBiden: Look, he was admittedly a pretty cool VP. He was quite good at going for the jugular and adopting an attacking stance in the debates, which is a key quality, but is he president material? I first of all worry that too many people consider Biden to be the cool VP, especially the younger generations. I am part of that younger generation (2020 will be the first election I'm able to vote in), but I worked on the Clinton campaign and with a Senator's office, as well as being a government major. I won't argue that I lived through may of the things you are, but I will say that I feel as though I've done some research, so don't dismiss me out of hand because I didn't fully understand the Obama administration's politics at the time. But getting back to Biden, I spoke with a good friend of mine and asked him why he thought Biden was a great candidate. This is an Ivy League student who attended one of the best public schools in America. His answer was: \"He's cool, he was a good VP.\" I'm afraid that many people will adopt that strategy and believe he's a good president as well. But I think he fails the Democratic Party in a couple of ways. This is a man who is relatively conservative on an issue where Dems can really separate themselves, decriminalizing marijuana. He's also not anti-abortion, but doesn't support federal funding for it. These are two keys issues that Democrats like to talk about again and again, and yet once Biden runs, will they actually care? I hope so.\nSanders and Warren: Both of them are in somewhat the same vein, running as much more progressive candidates. While some of the things they say I really support, working for single payer healthcare, making education far more affordable, their views on the economy are shocking in some respects. A federal jobs guarantee was sponsored by both of them, which would offer a job to every person. This ignores everything that an economist will tell you, that its good to have some unemployment (I believe 3-3.5% is the threshold), because if too many people are employed, workers have too much power. This will drive up wages too much, which can then cause inflation. Sanders is also a supporter of guns. How can we as Democrats honestly choose to support a man who believes \"Gun control legislation should ultimately fall on individual states.\" I'm not a single-issue voter, but this is just one of several red flags. Here is an interesting op-ed that goes into more detail on Warren's economic shortcomings: https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/10\/28\/opinion\/the-problem-with-elizabeth-warren.html.\nWith that little spiel in mind, I'll turn to who I like for the Democratic nomination in 2020. I will take into account both who is most likely to be successful running against Trump, as well as my own personal views on that person. I encourage people to disagree (respectfully) in the comments, and I am eager to learn if there are any outside candidates I haven't heard about (Please don't say Oprah, we don't need another celebrity).\nChris Murphy This pick leans a little more towards the \"I like this guy\", than that he will likely be elected. 47 was the age that Obama was elected however, so Murphy is not too young. I think his stance on gun control, including the 15 hour filibuster, was truly commendable. You can tell that he truly cares about the victims, and is truly attempting to curtail it. Murphy is a young, dynamic senator, who should check some of Democrats key boxes. Unfortunately, a white man is the most likely to win against Trump in 2020, I think. An interesting article\nSherrod Brown: Brown is perhaps the best choice for Democrats to reclaim their status as representing the white working class of America, which we saw Trump overwhelmingly win in 2016. As a senator in Ohio, he understands (while Hillary failed to), that at the end of the day the white workers often do prioritize economy over social issues. Now some of them might be profoundly racist, but a lot of their votes for Trump were centered around this idea that their taxes would be cut, and their jobs would be brought back. Brown has been shown to understand that, and has a good relationship with many working class people in his home state. He is both profoundly liberal while also catching the attention of the working class, which could be a winning combo. His fair trade, as opposed to free trade beliefs are a place where he seems to also separate from the general Democratic consensus, which is perhaps the one downside in my opinion.\nKamala Harris Harris has been a rising star in the Democratic Party, not because she's the next Obama, but because she's a principled, articulate, and passionate senator. She's been very progressive on some issues, but there are 2 reasons I have her out of the top spot. The first is that I find it hard to believe a half-black, half-indian woman will really be able to win this soon. I'm fully on board for Kamala 2024, I just worry that the uneducated whites will not at all vote more for Kamala than they did for Hillary (likely less), and the gain we would get from minorities wouldn't carry her to an election win anyway. The other is her questionable track record on crime. see. Not only has she defended in practice the California 3 strikes law, which is absurd, but although she claims to be anti-capital punishment she once asked the 9th Court to reverse their decision on stopping the Capital punishment. It's a pretty major issue where she ran more conservatively to her Republican opponent on when she ran for AG.\nAnother candidate that I like currently is Mitch Landrieu (although I haven't done too much research on him)\nNow, some of you may be more progressive and saying that my concerns for Bernie\/Warren are ill-founded. That's fine. I'm just eager to see who you believe, 2 years out should be the Democratic nominee. Hope you all respond and give your well-put answers for why I'm completely off track! Oh, and Vote Blue!","subreddit":"Liberal","title":"Who would your top candidates for 2020 be?"}

{"author":"ElGrandeRojo2018","created_utc":1532410442,"num_comments":21,"score":0,"selftext":"I honestly believe that the real reason so many Americans go for conservative candidates, time and again, instead of liberal ones, goes back to geography, and almost *solely* geography. America is an incredibly big country. In fact, it's almost ridiculous how gigantic it is. And the harsh truth about America being so big is that, a great deal of the people who live inside of it, tend to live *much further apart from one another* , than people in, for example, most EU countries.\n\nI have hung out with more EUropeans in my life, at this point, than Americans, and most of my Euro friends, even if they're \"poor\", tend to feel like widely traveled people. They have seen cities all over Europe. Some of them, like my friends in Spain right near Portugal, are regularly crossing borders into other countries. Like it's nothing.\n\nCompare this to my American friends, and the friends I know my parents had. I know people who live 30 minutes from NYC, in small Connecticut working towns, who are in their 40s and have never seen NYC a single time. Some ppl will find it preposterous. How could they never see it? The answer is simple: In a way, USA has no real mainstream train system like they do in Europe.  They don't have it, because they don't care about going to any cities all that much. Why not? Because what is so special about 9 out of 10 American cities? They are not Barcelona or Rome or Florence. In many an American mind, there is simply no reson to travel anywhere in this country. In fact, most dream vacations here will revolve around places far from any city: The Grand Canyon, Yellowstone Park, surfing on a secret beach in California. How often do you hear someone say \"I'll tell ya, i just really need to go to see Cincinatti.\" For most of us, theres no reason. Its going to take another 900 years of the world spinning until Cincinatti will sound like Barcelona does now.\n\nFor many Americans, its a \"one time every 10 years thing\" to be aboard a train. This is really just not the case in Europe.  And this really brings up a much wider point, which is that Americans actually don't know other Americans all that well. HOw could they? They live far from them. Even the American urban centers are strangely impersonal and cold feeling, in comparison to what I've seen in liberal Euro land. Once you actually see Europe, it becomes very easy to understand why they're so liberal, and we are not.\n\nI think its important that this is heavily stressed because so much crap gets talked about Americans, but, the truth is, they're just living by their particular geographical rules (and also their particular lack of, you know, thousands of years worth of history). In our own time now, its no secret, for example, that all the US cities are literally all blue. But these US cities still don't manage  to switch the culture completely, because the city still isn't quite the focal point of American culture, even when you're talking about pop culture. The European culture, in my experience, is almost entirely consumed by a heavily urban mindset. Museums, coffeeshops, day trips to other historical cities nearby. This is very important for them.\n\nIn the US, its simply not this prevalent. I grew up in a very troubled  Amreican city: Almost everyone wanted to leave it. That was the main dream. And most of them didn't want to leave for NYC -- that was interpreted as an even worse hell than where we came from. They wanted to move to the deep suburbs and live....far away from their neighbors. Because in America, the only thing a lot of neighbors ever seemed to mean, was that you were probably living in the projects, or in the middle of a place that was about to break out into a gang war. US cities look like they're the ones that got bombed in WW2, in comparison to the gleaming Euro centers. I don't blame anyone whose poor for wanting to escape them as soon as possible.\n\nThe American dream, thanks precisely to the nations geography and \"new world status\", is inherently tied up not with a sense of community -- but with a sense of escaping the community. So why, i ask, are so many people so surprised, by how hard it is, to get liberal ideas inside the US bloodstream? To me, it's sad, and i would indeed rather live the Euro liberal lifestyle--- but it's also not very surprising to me, when election after election in the US, inevitably goes conservative. So my real question i guess is, why do so many liberals here find it so unusually shocking?","subreddit":"Liberal","title":"My Opinion On Why Liberalism Fails in USA"}

A woman critic of this new Liberal political star said, \"It would be very easy to believe that my children deserve healthcare and an education.\"  She, I presume, does feel obligated to  provide her children those necessities. If she didn't, she would be very reasonably described as an unfit parent.  What she really is criticizing is the notion that she, as a member of society, should feel obligated to contribute to the provision of those necessities for other people's children.  The lie that has been at the basis of her self serving ideology is that holding individuals only accountable for themselves promotes responsibility in every individual to provide for the needs of the society as a whole in the most efficient and thereby beneficial way.  This is self-evidently not true.  It is benefitial to the society as a whole if its population is generally healthy and educated.  That can only be reasonably viewed adversely if the intent is to have or sustain a society in which one group is to be favored over another.

{"author":"subheight640","created_utc":1532656876,"num_comments":7,"score":5,"selftext":"So I've been thinking about creating something lately. Call me naive or whatnot. \n\nI think American democracy needs radical reform. And I think the way to accomplish reform is to create our own *alternative government*. This alternative government will first act as a nonprofit lobbying interest group, funneling money to preferred local candidates. Then the alternative government will slowly \"take over\" local governments, state governments, and finally the whole shebang. \n\nSo what's so great about the \"alternative government\"? What's the goal? It's purpose will be the realization of [*delegative democracy*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Delegative_democracy), or another purer, more robust form of democracy.  \n\nIMO delegative democracy is the most impressive form I've read about. In the reality of day to day life, it's impossible for anybody to actively manage legislatures, judges, and bureaucrats. The vast majority of Americans do not have the time or desire to research dozens of political candidates to elect to dozens of political offices. As a result, our Democratic process is complete bullshit. Our government is out of control of the people, because the people do not know what is happening on the local, state, and federal level. The vast majority of people are unable to manage several dozen political positions, nor are they equipped to vote on budgetary issues. \n\nIn other words, Democracy needs to be simplified. People have enough trouble choosing a single candidate. Well, why don't we just let them do just that? Just pick one person, anybody you want, to be your representative, your delegate. It could be your mom, or your boss, or a celebrity, or somebody in your social circle. It could be yourself. It could be someone you trust to make wise decisions on your behalf. Then your delegate could take on the responsibilities of politics, or he could then pass his and your choice along to somebody else. Hell, with the advent of computers and machine vision, we could even start *splitting* votes. Can't choose between two great candidates? Elect both of them. Don't want to give up all of your legislative voting power? Then split your choice. \"The average voter is stupid\". Well, is the average politician any smarter than the voter? \n\nSo how can we realize this? I believe we must create an \"Alternative Government\" that fakes it until it makes it. \nThe alternative government will begin as a political interest group composed of any US citizen who wants to join. Dues would be first collected on a voluntary basis and would be used to target local governments and \"convert\" them to a delegative democracy or alternative system. Dues will also be used on political research to better inform its members on who to vote for. \n\nMeanwhile, money will also be pumped into political candidates in proportion to the alternative government's voter choices. Lobbyists would be hired as the first proto-delegates. So the purpose of the interest group would be first to advocate for democracy, and then attempt to force the actual government to vote according to Democracy's desires. \n\nIn the ideal, delegative democracy would be able to minimize the degrees of separation between the American people and their legislative representatives. I believe that Democracy has made good choices. I believe that if Democracy was working, we would have never had to choose between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. \n\n\nTLDR: I have an idea. Do you think it could work? Is anybody interested in joining? ","subreddit":"Liberal","title":"A proposal to fix American politics on the Local, State, and Federal level.

Although it could be a good thing, it very likely won't pass, specially with Trump as president. And I wonder if it is really needed a Medicare for All. I think that studies should be made to see how much do people need to pay, how many people can afford to pay without being left out of money for their annual family vacation, and how much the taxpayer base can and is willing to chip in to help out, help that can include helping themselves out in providing Medicare when private health insurance is unaffordable or does not cover or health care is itself is unaffordable.
