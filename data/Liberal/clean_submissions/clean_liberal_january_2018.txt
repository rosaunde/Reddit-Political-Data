(reviewer)\n\nKilling Detente is a highly readable account of an ill-considered and maladroit exercise in intelligence reassessment that delayed--but did not derail--detente, the process of accommodation that occurred between Washington and Moscow in the mid-1970s.\n\nIn presenting her analysis of what became known as the Team B exercise, Anne Cahn uses her extensive experience in international affairs, a careful review of many previously unavailable documents, and interviews with key individuals involved in the affair. (I should disclose that I worked with the author at the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Committee on National Security, and reviewed drafts of some chapters of her book.)\n\nShortly after Gerald Ford succeeded Richard Nixon, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) began to push for an alternative review of Soviet strategic capabilities, contending that the National Intelligence Estimates prepared by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) might be understating Soviet strategic strength. Competent analysts, however, had criticized the CIA's reports as greatly **overstating** Soviet military expenditures. **[WhereIsFiber's note: The Soviets, now the Russians, have always spent a small fraction on defense compared to our wildly wasteful U.S. \"Defense\" budgets. The USA spends on \"Defense\" what the next 12 countries combined spend on defense. That's why our economy is just limping along and our national debt has skyrocketed to 19 Trillion, and dangerously rising.]**\n\nIn late 1975, then-CIA Director William Colby responded negatively to the PFIAB proposal and disagreed with its contention that the agency's intelligence estimates erred by \"projecting a sense of complacency.\" But President Ford, engaged as he was with Ronald Reagan's challenge for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination, was sensitive to possible fight-wing criticism. He eventually authorized the Team B adventure.\n\nThe initial idea was to appoint three panels of outside experts that would assess, respectively, the threat to U.S. ICBM survival created by Soviet missile accuracy, the Soviet anti-submarine warfare capability against U.S. nuclear missile submarines, and the extent to which Soviet air defenses could prevent penetration by strategic bombers.\n\nThe navy, however, considered information about the operational aspects of submarine patrols and whether they might be trailed by Soviet assets as information that could not be shared, even with the CIA. The second panel, accordingly, was reoriented to deal with Soviet strategic objectives. It is the work of this panel that is generally referred to as the Team B Report.\n\nWhatever might be said for evaluation of strategic capabilities by a group of outside experts, the impracticality of achieving useful results by \"independent\" analysis of strategic objectives should have been self-evident. Moreover, the futility of the Team B enterprise was assured by the selection of the panel's members. Rather than including a diversity of views, as was recently done in putting together the, so-called Rumsfeld Commission on the ballistic missile threat, the Strategic Objectives Panel was composed entirely of individuals who had made careers of viewing the Soviet menace with alarm.\n\nAs the author notes, the panel's chairman, Richard Pipes, has been called the \"intellectual godfather\" of the thesis that the Soviets had rejected nuclear parity and were bent on fighting a nuclear war. **[My note: This is laughable.]** In an interview, Pipes told Cahn that he wrote most of the first section of the report, which criticized the CIA for underestimating the \"intensity, scope, and implicit threat\" posed by the Soviet Union, by using evidence relating to capabilities rather than intentions. This section argued that the really important evidence demonstrated that \"Soviet leaders are first and foremost offensively rather than defensively minded.\" **[Note: Haha, if you're going to waste Trillions of U.S. taxpayers' money on \"Defense,\" you need a big boogeyman/bogeyman, a scary \"enemy,\" a phantom menace. The reality is the U.S. foisted the Cold War on the Russians.  The Russians wanted to be our ally, just like the French are our ally.  In fact, the Russians were our allies during World War 2 against the Nazis.  After World War 2, U.S. war mongers started the Cold War against Russia.  No less than double Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling has said the Soviets/Russians did not want the Cold War.]**\n\nIt is now entirely clear, however, that by the early 1970s Soviet leaders had concluded that the Soviet Union could not win, and might not even survive, a nuclear war. Anyone thereafter dealing with Soviet officials could readily recognize that they held no illusions about having military superiority over the United States and its allies. They were completely aware that NATO was a security alliance with a solidarity and common purpose that could not be ascribed to the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact. Even the dullest of Soviet leaders must have known that a limited nuclear war would almost certainly have meant the destruction of the Kremlin--and thus of the Soviet empire.\n\nDetente was not doing too well when Team B met in 1975. It had been badly damaged by the U.S.-Soviet confrontation precipitated in 1973 by the Israeli-Egyptian war. In October of that year, the encirclement of Egypt's Third Army by Israeli defense forces prompted Leonid Brezhnev to call for joint U.S.-Soviet intervention to stop the fighting. Otherwise, suggested the Soviet premier, the Soviet Union might consider acting alone. In response to this muted threat, the United States called a worldwide alert of both its conventional and nuclear forces.\n\nAlthough the crisis soon passed, it cast a continuing chill on the dialogue between Washington and Moscow. The Team B Report was a further blow to detente and, as the author observes, it provided \"intellectual fodder\" for the Committee on the Present Danger, which was spearheaded by former Undersecretary of State Eugene Rostow. In its first policy statement, released two days after the 1976 presidential election, the committee stated that \"the principal threat to our nation, to world peace, and to the cause of human freedom is the Soviet drive for dominance based upon an unparalleled military buildup.\" **[Lol. You accuse your \"enemy\" of what you, yourself, are most guilty.]** The Soviet Union, the committee concluded, \"has not altered its long-held goal of a world dominated from a single center--Moscow.\" **[The jokes keep coming.]**\n\nNot surprisingly, the founding board members of the Committee on the Present Danger included Team B members Richard Pipes, Foy Kohler, Paul Nitze, and William Van Cleave. When Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, Pipes was named the president's special adviser on the Soviet Union and, in a masterpiece of miscasting, Eugene Rostow, the motivating force behind the Committee on the Present Danger, became director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.\n\nFortunately, Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power and the rapport he developed with Ronald Reagan, beginning with their first meeting in Geneva in 1985, put an end to superpower confrontation politics and, in a few years, to the Soviet Union itself. In the interest of fairness, I must note that Team B member Paul Nitze played a constructive role in that process as arms control adviser to Secretary of State George Shultz.\n\nAlthough detente in the long run survived the right-wing attack, **[this book was published in 1998 during Bill Clinton's presidency, so, no, detente did not survive the Bush/Cheney regime and the \"Project For a New American Century,\" the 21st Century's equivalent of the anti-Nixon, anti-detente \"Team B\" liars]** the painful consequences of the Team B affair can still be felt in the diversion of massive funds from genuine human needs to a grossly excessive U.S. military buildup.\n\n\"Killing Detente: The Right Attacks the CIA\" author Anne Cahn voices warm appreciation for the legal work that gave her access to previously undisclosed documents through the Freedom of Information Act. But it is the author's thoughtful analysis of these documents and her searching interviews with key players that give Killing Detente its scope and depth.\n\nPreviously we knew little about the Team B Strategic Objectives Panel apart from its report. We now know that the way its members were selected and the manner in which it operated virtually preordained its conclusions. Not only is Anne Cahn's book of historical interest and useful as a teaching tool, but it is also a valuable study of how not to set defense policy.\n\nPaul C. Warnke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., was director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and chief arms negotiator in the Carter administration, and assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs in the Johnson administration.\n\n0 0 0 0\n\nAnne Hessing Cahn is Scholar in Residence at The American University in Washington, D.C.  She has served on the staff of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Department of Defense and, from 1982 to 1988, was President and Executive Director of the Committee for National Security.  Her articles have appeared in leading newspapers, including the New York Times and Los Angeles Times, and in a wide variety of professional journals.  She has also testified before Congress on numerous occasions on security issues.\n\n**[Note: Everyone, you and I, would be paying 70 percent less every year on our Federal Income Taxes if it weren't for decades of massive accumulated national debt resulting from wildly excessive overspending in the \"Defense\" industry.

They didn't need 60 votes. They needed 51. You can pass any budget vote through reconciliation, and you only need 51 votes--a simple majority. But you only get to use budget reconciliation once per year. Republicans decided to pass their tax bill through reconciliation instead of a budget. They decided to pass a bill that by design took away people's insurance and gave the richest Americans and corporations huge tax cuts. That was their choice. They could have worked with Democrats back then, gotten 60 votes and not needed them now. But again, they made a choice. Now the GOP needs Dems and after 10 years of obstructionism and an unwillingness to work with them, all they have to fall back on is what they're comfortable with--blaming Democrats.
