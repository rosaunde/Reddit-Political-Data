{"author":"-0-O-","created_utc":1525848050,"num_comments":0,"score":0,"selftext":"Up front, I'm mostly a liberal person. \n\nI often think about ways things could go south. I think about the ramifications if the 'alt-right' somehow ends up in the victor's books as the heroes who were right all along. I think about the ways this could unfold, and lately I've been thinking about Oliver North.\n\nAs many of you know, Oliver North was proven to be guilty of some heinous crimes while holding his position, but all of the charges were dropped due to heavy political pressure. One of the biggest influences being John Bolton, who is still in office and pushing agendas.\n\nBut to many, North was a good guy. He testified in front of congress, and gave information under immunity, that was later argued to be basis of gathering evidence. And the information he gave was useful. We found out about a lot of corruption, etc., while ignoring the fact that North was responsible for much of this corruption. \n\nIt's not as if he claimed that he was commanded to break the law, and that it was actually someone higher up who coerced him into making the deals he made.\n\nSo, if the guy is to be seen as a hero, a whistleblower, that's good and all, but we never saw any convictions. Of anyone. And it was his own crimes that he made us more aware of.\n\nSo, why would the government want to protect this man?\n\nThe conservative answer, I assume, would be that just making the public aware of the corruption is a great deed, even if nobody goes down for it. He's clearly a good guy, because otherwise he would have just kept playing ball. It's understandable that his superior wouldn't take the fall, because whoever that is must be someone who really has their claws deep, and is untouchable. And the reason North got off free, is both because he didn't tread too close by throwing superiors under the bus, and because he does know more information, and threatened to make it public.\n\nThe left believes he's a war criminal and is the person who has his claws deep into the system.\n\nIf the latter is true, we should be considering why he's suddenly back in the public eye.\n\nGiven his history, he's a perfect candidate for capitalizing on what conservatives already believe about him. It would be easy for conservatives to believe that he does have more information about how corrupt our government is. Maybe now, almost 30 years later, he is willing to out people by name. \n\nWe know corruption is bipartisan. Some of the people who spoke in support of North in 1991 were Democrats. \n\nWhat if publicly outing war crimes was not just a plea to escape trouble, or some good deed that was done, but instead all part of the plot.\n\nTrump, who is \"not a politician\", is the other perfect character for the plot. \n\nIf during his presidency, an unprecedented amount of information comes out about previous administrations corruption, his base and more will think, \"Wow, Trump did it after all\".\n\nRepublicans and Democrats will be the fall-guys. It will be the liberals and conservatives who already resent the two parties who will be most targeted to have faith in the \"new-era\"\n\nAnd most conservative will immediately identify with this group. No matter how much the loved Reagan, or Bush. \n\nSo everyone will be laughing at liberals and how wrong they were, while the corruption lives on under yet another curtain.\n\nThoughts?","subreddit":"Liberal","title":"I've been thinking about Oliver North."}
