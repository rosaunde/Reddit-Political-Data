And oops, all of that and more is gone due to much higher health insurance caused by Trump's perhaps illegal dismantling of the ACA without legislation. \n\nSo the middle classes taxes are in fact lower, Yes the upper classes cot more cuts but EVERYONE got their taxes cut. So you threw in the Affordable Care Act because you couldn't find anything to criticize about taxes. Moved the goal posts, That is a separate issue. \n\n [https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/theapothecary\/2017\/03\/22\/yes-it-was-the-affordable-care-act-that-increased-premiums\/#211c6a211d25](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/theapothecary\/2017\/03\/22\/yes-it-was-the-affordable-care-act-that-increased-premiums\/#211c6a211d25)\n\nIt turns out that across the board, for all ages and family sizes, for HMO, PPO, and POS plans, premium increases averaged about 60 percent from 2013, the last year before ACA reforms took effect, to 2017. In same length of time preceding that, all groups experienced premium increases of less than 10 percent, and most age groups actually experienced premium decreases, on average.\n\nThese findings come from new data from [eHealth](http:\/\/ehealth.com\/), which not only sells ACA Marketplace health plans, but sold a wide variety of health plans through its own website for many years before the ACA was passed, as well as both on and off the Exchanges after the ACA took effect. \n\nACA 2017\n\n[https:\/\/www.heritage.org\/health-care-reform\/report\/how-obamacare-raised-premiums](https:\/\/www.heritage.org\/health-care-reform\/report\/how-obamacare-raised-premiums)\n\n* Certain provisions of the ACA\u2014including taxes and fees, essential health benefits, and actuarial value requirements\u2014exerted discretely measurable and direct increases in premiums.\n* Other provisions, particularly the new rules on adjusting premiums for age and sex, primarily had the effect of redistributing costs from some enrollees to others, but to some degree likely exerted a secondary effect on premiums by altering the composition of the resulting pool of enrollees. For example, the ACA\u2019s requirement that people in their 60s be assessed premiums that are no greater than three times the premiums paid by those in their 20s redistributes costs from older individuals to younger ones. That requirement, however, could have exerted a secondary effect on premiums to the extent that it resulted in older adults being disproportionately represented in the insurance pools.\n\n[https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/10\/25\/opinions\/affordable-health-care-exchange-premiums-jost\/index.html](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2016\/10\/25\/opinions\/affordable-health-care-exchange-premiums-jost\/index.html)\n\n The HHS report documents what has already been widely reported -- that after two years of moderate premium increases (2% for 2015 and 7.5% for 2016) premiums are going up sharply for 2017. Across the 39 states using the HealthCare.gov platform, the median second-lowest cost silver plan, which sets the benchmark for premium tax credits, will increase 16%, while the [average increase looking only at states on the federal exchange is 25%](http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/10\/24\/news\/economy\/obamacare-premiums\/index.html). \n\n Second, premium increases vary sharply from state to state. While in seven states premiums are increasing more than 50%, in 10 states premium increases are 7% or less. Meanwhile, some of the states with the largest premium increases had the lowest premiums to begin with. And there is something states can do to lower their premium increases -- all of the states with increases at 7% or below have expanded Medicaid, while four of the states with the highest premium increases have not yet done so. \n\nACA 2019 predictions\n\nYou are correct premiums are increasing but they were increasing already, plus ACA wasn't repealed, It was altered.\n\n[https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/07\/06\/politics\/obamacare-insurers\/index.html](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/07\/06\/politics\/obamacare-insurers\/index.html)\n\n Those that stayed jacked up their rates by 27%, on average, for 2018. This increase, which comes on top of a 21% hike the year before, helped them cover their policyholders' medical care. As of late 2017, many insurers had profitable individual market businesses, Cox said. \n\nAlso, Obamacare will remain the law of the land for now since Republicans in Congress can't muster enough votes to repeal it. Insurers are monitoring two big actions that will affect the law -- Congress' repeal of the[ individual mandate penalty ](http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2017\/12\/15\/news\/economy\/obamacare-individual-mandate-tax\/index.html)for 2019 and the Trump [administration's broadening ](http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/02\/20\/news\/economy\/trump-obamacare-short-term-health-insurance\/index.html)of two [alternatives to Obamacare](https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2018\/06\/19\/politics\/association-health-plans-ruling\/index.html) \\-- but many feel they can cover those changes through increases in next year's premiums.\n\n\"They can price for that,\" Cox said, of the changes. \"They at least know the rules of the game.\"\n\n \\&gt;Funny but regulations are GOOD because they stop exactly what's happening right now. The dismantling of the protections for people and industries that can't protect themselves. Education, EPA, Veterans and others. \n\nI WAS ASKED WHAT HE DID FOR THE ECONOMY NOT THE EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT. \n\nAlso i'm against cutting regulation for the environment, but the cut regulations have helped the economy.\n\n \\&gt;As usually the right just parrots what they read in Fox News. Try looking at some real sources. \n\nI'm not a fucking republican, i'm a moderate. I like some things Trump has done and hate others.

He counter-argues in a way that makes it hard to argue. \n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s clear that his belief in mythology is the strongest guide of his world view. He claims that his religion doesn\u2019t get in the way of his political views and that he doesn\u2019t care what other people do, but he does. He basically advocates for Jim Crow style methods but against minorities that are repressed for their sexuality and not their skin color. He\u2019s not a racist, but he\u2019s definitely a homophobe who gets pleasure by tearing other people down. This is why he refuses to call a transgender person by their preferred pronoun. When he talks about it, there\u2019s a since of pride about it. He clearly is proud that he\u2019s able to upset these people.\n\nThose are not traits that a real intellectual would have. Not to mention, I can\u2019t concede that someone\u2019s an intellectual when they believe that the stories in the Bible are literal. Like Noah literally built a giant boat and two of each animal came aboard for 30 days. And Jonah literally lives in a whale for days (weeks?) because this man in the sky wanted to test him. If you believe those things actually happened, you\u2019re not intelligent enough to be considered an intellectual. Now, if you think those are stories that attempt to teach a life lesson, and therefore have value, but aren\u2019t literal, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with that though I\u2019d argue there are better stories.\n\nEDIT: In addition, if you look into his background, I don\u2019t see much strife or other events that\u2019s happened to him that would build character. This is most likely why he comes across to me as a 30 year old man-child that never fully developed. He acts like a spoiled teenager. For fucks sake, he was super anti-Trump but now apparently likes Trump because he\u2019s nominated conservative judges. Never mind the fact that he\u2019s destroying the office of the presidency, our standing in the world, the country and lies like gangbusters. Anyone that can overlook all of that because they\u2019re nominating judges you like is spineless and puts party over country. ","created_utc":1533194111,"score":6,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

This effect also implicitly allows the legislature to preempt the adoption of new technologies as long as it can catch it early enough. For example, this was done successfully with machine guns in 1934, and again in 1986.\n\nIn that same case, the court found blanket handgun bans to be unconstitutional because Americans commonly choose handguns for the lawful propose of self defense. However, weapons that are \"dangerous and unusual\" are left for legislative restriction, and that's ok since people don't commonly use landmines, machine guns, and Anti Aircraft Artillery to defend the homestead.

Until the 1960s, this was the political layout of the Civil Rights movement.\n\nBy the mid 1960s, laws enforcing racial preferences were ended.  With the legal foundations of discrimination removed, Republicans felt it was inappropriate and counterproductive to use the legal system to attempt to end the social problem of racism through punitive race-based laws or racial preferences. \n\nIn the same timeframe, the Democratic Party evolved and joined the Republicans in their objection to racism.  They however chose a path of applying new racial preferences enforced by law to somehow undo the problems caused by previous racial preferences. \n\nThe Republicans continue to fight against race-based laws and preferences.  Since these preferences help people who are not white the Democrats found a good marketing campaign that painted the rejection of racial preferences to be an act of racism.\n\nThis marketing was given a boost as pro-white racists moved away from the Democrats' anti-white racial preferences.  They found the Republicans' rejection of racial preferences to be less objectionable.  One of the Democrats key marketing slogan in recent years has been \"The Republican Party may not be racist, but it is the party favored by racists.\n\nRepublicans have the same anti-racism in government stance they had when the party formed.

The key conclusion being:\n\n&gt; Gender dysphoria has been hypothesized to develop due to an altered sexual differentiation of the body and the brain during early development (30, 31). Here, we investigated a unique data set of individuals with GD at two different developmental stages, in order to determine whether they would respond to androstadienone in accordance with their natal sex, rather than their experienced gender. We found that both, adolescent girls and boys with GD showed hypothalamic activations that reflected their experienced gender.\n\nSo a \"man trapped in a woman's body\" has *some* physical justification of being a man trapped in a woman's body...but because penis, you should be offended by her wanting to be called \"her\"?","created_utc":1533246385,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

That's not data.  That's trash.  Much like Mitt Romney and countless others, those born into affluent families usually do truly convince themselves that they earned what they have, despite all evidence being to the cotnrary. \nIn actual studies, [it's consistently found that those in the top 1% of accumulated wealth inherited on average about $4.5-5 million](https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/econres\/scfindex.htm), and this average dramatically increases as you go further up the needle-like tower of income distribution.  Again, what working class people might deem rich is usually often a small fraction of a fraction of what would actually be considered rich, i.e., literally the point at which one has accumulated enough wealth as to no longer have to work.  These people may have a title, and their decisions certainly have massive repercussions (mainly for others), but they are not workers.  They perform nothing resembling labor.  They are owners of shares and assets, and these are what provide their revenue stream.  The closest thing to work that they do is gamble, and often even that isn't with their own money.\n\nNo.  In truth, most of the rich did not come from nothing, have far more than just a couple million dollars, and live lives based around constant self-gratification that in no way resembles actual work.  This has been effectively the situation in not just the United States, and not just in the last century, but throughout nearly all human communities, throughout nearly all of human history.

They aren't defending the Second Amendment, they are trying to make the 2nd Amendment into something that it isn't by heavily changing what words and grammar mean. The right's interpretation of Constitution, like the similar pattern I found with fellow church goers, is not what's written and requires stretches in language to defend their view, not the other way around. \n\n\nThere are two glaring problems, grammar, and wording. \n\n\nFor example. The Army is important to safeguard our nation and should be well taken care of, they work hard and put their lives on the line for our way of life, the people deserve every right and access to healthcare, education, and the tools needed to get the job done. It's a difficult job, but I'm proud of, and support the people in every way I can, usually that's through taxes and increasing their benefits at every opportunity. \n\n\nAt what point did I stop talking about people in the Army? Where did I reference civilians or anyone else that isn't in the Army specifically? Becuase that entire time I was talking about people in the Army, not factory workers or teachers. \n\nNow for the text.\nA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\n\nSure times are different, but we aren't referencing everyone outside the Militia. Lefties even say that they don't mind people being armed as long as they are trained and qualified, literally what the 2nd Amendment is saying. Want to have access to military grade weapons? Join a well regulated militia, not backyard warriors, but an organized, well regulated group that is managed well. This also means people are taken care of and, I would assume, well regulated means unqualified individuals don't get to partake in militia activities. Regulated and regulations, accountability, quality, standards seem to be the nightmare for the right in every regard. \n\n\nI'm also pretty sure slave owners would prefer militia members to have access to guns, and not everyone on the street. Just saying. It doesn't matter how you slice it, Yank or Confederate, military grade weapons were an issue and everyone wanted to make sure the state, like the Army, could not come in and legally seize weapons. This as well as making sure unqualified people, people not in a well regulated militia of some sort, were not needlessly armed to start trouble. \n\n\nPerson vs people.\n\nThe second issue is that we have to completely forget what these two words mean, only in this one portion of the Constitution do we have to literally forget what grammar and definitions are to change it's meaning to, \"Everyone gets access to military grade weapons no matter what.\" People and person is used specifically in the Constitution constantly, and mind you these aren't 5th graders scribbling on paper, most of those involved in this drafting read and spoke multiple languages.

{"author":"Paretio","body":"Well, the nation is swinging toward conservatism (I think that's spelled right).\n\nA lot of millenials are getting very disillusioned with a lack of financial stability.  And conservatives typically do well with money (at least by public perception).  I used to dream about all the stuff I wanted to be, but I got sick of bouncing from job to job, going hungry a lot.  Now I do HVAC and I've got more money than I know what to do with.  And pretty soon I may take a far higher paying job as a sysadmin and bump up to a nearly 6 figure income.\n\nWhat I practice is generous payment.  I tip very heavily, usually at least 25% (restaurant work is hard), I pay the asking price on bartered goods and I buy from local farmer stands for things I like.  I do make luxury purchases periodically, but not often.\n\nHowever, I never just hand someone a wad of cash.  It doesn't work.  I do donate to local charities that help with things like education, medical needs, etc.  Stuff that the donation will build and lift, not just create 'status quo'.\n\nMy neighbors don't know how much I've got, and they don't need to know.  If I see a genuine need, I usually sneak an envelope full of cash (for the A.C. repair, car repair, etc) into their mailbox with a note saying Answered Prayers.  If they choose to misuse that money that's ultimately not a worry.  It's not fair to judge others on wasted money and not look in the mirror.\n\nCapitalism can be used for great good.  Schindlers List is an example, albeit an extreme one.  Many business owners are quite generous, just out of the public eye.  The owner of the last place I worked paid for scholarships out of his own pocket for immigrants to go to college.  He also put money into a group legal fund in case something happened while they attended college.  The owner bedore, made a point to hire felons and those who couldn't be hired elsewhere so they can get their lives put back together.\n\nAs for being pro rights, that's a noble ideal.  But really only an ideal.  A right is universally recognized.  And people don't have any of those, not even to life itself.  I would point out the commonality between liberals and conservatives.  We both want people to work, and work well.  We both want Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  Don't tell my Republican friends, but Liberals do drag the nation forward, albeit kicking and screaming.  You guys just, forget what the original cost was to get to this point, and that's what Conservatives do well.   And how fast we can lose all this.

I listen to Glenn Beck on Thursday\u2019s (carpool, driver picks, and I pick Monday\u2019s when it\u2019s \u201cStuff You Should Know) and I know Beck bashes Trump routinely.

So yeah, conservatives are more likely to believe in God, but the difference isn't significant enough to prove your point. If anything, it only proves that liberals are slightly less irrational. Slightly. I wouldn't say it supports your arguement at all.\n\nYour point about vaccinations is just false. Again, I don't know who you've talked to, but your anecdotal evidence is irrelevant. Anti-vax is predominantly a left wing movement. Do you see more Hollywood liberals talking about it, or more evangelical priests?

{"author":"killerofpain","body":"Point 1.)  Since this originated from your claim that \"liberals are the ones looking at horoscopes\", let's look at the statistics on \"How likely is it for liberals to believe in astrology compared to conservatives\", and \"How likely is it for conservatives to believe in god compared to liberals\".\n\nHere are the statistics:\n\n[https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/volokh-conspiracy\/wp\/2014\/02\/20\/the-6-political-groups-least-likely-to-believe-astrology\/?utm\\_term=.3405fc3dcf6e](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/volokh-conspiracy\/wp\/2014\/02\/20\/the-6-political-groups-least-likely-to-believe-astrology\/?utm_term=.3405fc3dcf6e)\n\nFrom the statistics above, roughly 40% of the conservative groups read horoscopes, while almost 56% of democrats groups do.\n\nHere's the statistics on the latter\n\n[http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/religious-landscape-study\/political-ideology\/conservative\/](http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/religious-landscape-study\/political-ideology\/conservative\/)\n\n[http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/religious-landscape-study\/political-ideology\/liberal\/](http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/religious-landscape-study\/political-ideology\/liberal\/)\n\nOver 92% of the conservatives believe in god, absolute certain + fairy certain. While democrats are only 69%.\n\nSo if we are going to talk about how \"conservatives are not the one reading up on horoscope\" as you claimed in the original post, It certainly is no less accurate to say that \"conservatives are more likely to believe in god\" by your standards. So if we are measuring scientific illiteracy by how much a group is willing to believe in superstitions, conservatives top this one.\n\nPoints 2.) While there are more left Hollywood celebrities who are anti-vaxxer, right wing conservatives are less likely to vaccinate, as evident by this study ([http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0191728#pone-0191728-g001](http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0191728#pone-0191728-g001))(Read result and discussion).\n\nThe location of the outbreak is irrelevant, it doesn't tell us which group is less likely to vaccinate, study on \"which group is less likely to vaccinate\" does, as most outbreak patients are unvaccinated.\n\nPoint 3.) Christian scientists, the practitioner and believers of christian science (A religious denomination)- the beliefs that diseases and sickness are mental error, not physical, and can be treated through prayers and have often rejected or undermine the legitimacy of modern science. Most of its members are republicans\/conservatives.\n\nPoint 4.)  See point 2 for why anti-vaxxer is not left-leaning. You are giving hypothetical when you say that \"If you using it in place of actual medication, can be extremely dangerous\". But are there liberals using them instead of actual medications? Can you give me an example of someone dying from using ointment instead of actual medications? I can give you actual cases of christian scientists causing death, higher death rate, and anti-vaxxers (who I proved in point 2 are mostly right leaning) causing actual outbreaks.\n\nArgument by hypothetical, claiming a certain practice \"CAN BE\" dangerous by coming up with hypothetical while there are MANY examples that shows that there are conservatives groups that are causing more deaths by rejecting modern medicine, is a poor argument.\n\nPoint 5). As shown in point 1. liberals, while more likely to believe in astrology, are less likely to believe in Christianity - religion that has been historically responsible for many wars, deaths, corruptions, and sexual scandals even in the modern day.\n\nBut I don't want to debate the history of Christianity and their pros and cons and blah, so on the spirit of being adherent to the topic at hand, let's go back to point 1.) and look at \"how beliefs reflect our scientific literacy\". I have yet to hear a liberal deny theory of evolution, big bang, or even believe that the earth is 6000 years old from believing in astrology, while most conservatives are prone to such delusions, as evident by the fact that 4 in 10 Americans believe earth was created 10000 years ago, and most young earth creationists are conservatives.\n\nI am glad you came back. not many people have the guts to return to engage an honest debate instead of exiting like a coward. If I cannot respect your belief I at least respect your courage. But the fact that you think my arguments actually \"BTFO\" by your flimsy logic shows precisely....the point of my post.

I must not have have been clear at all, so I'll try again. By YOUR standards, neither Democrats nor Republicans can reliably be called rational when it comes to scientific beliefs. That's my point. My point wasn't that conservatives are smarter. My point was that if this is YOUR criteria, then liberals are only slightly LESS dumb. Not smart. This is not a win.\n\n2. Fair enough, but this study seems to me to be flawed in a couple ways. First of all, the surveys were done on the internet. I shouldn't have to explain the issue with that. There's a couple other issues but I'll have to read it more closely. That being said, it's only one study. And their conclusion is up for debate.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/energy-environment\/wp\/2015\/01\/26\/the-biggest-myth-about-vaccine-deniers-that-theyre-all-a-bunch-of-hippie-liberals\/?utm_term=.3145b7ead5b5\n\nYou haven't proven anything.\n\n3. Well, okay. You found a minority religous group of conservatives with crazy beliefs. Doesn't really prove anything, because there are similar nutbag leftist groups.\n\n4. See point 2. \nAnd okay, my hypothetical wasn't a good argument. No, off the top of my head I can't name a specific left wing person who died from using ointment instead of seeing a doctor. I've never been pressed to look into it, and I wouldn't know where to begin. But okay, let's assume you're correct, and that more conservatives are causing deaths by rejecting modern science. The reason you think I'm using a poor argument is because you don't understand my argument. I'm not arguing that conservatives are the ideaology of science. I'm saying the liberals aren't. I'm saying they are both ideologies that will twist and suit science to their needs. And also, you didn't prove anything with one mediocre study.\n\n5.  Now you're just moving the goalposts. Unscientific is unscientific. Now you want to argue about who's more unscientific. 70% of liberals believe in the invisible man in the sky. Full stop. Beyond that, we can chat all day about just how crazy different groups beliefs are, but the fact is that crossing the line is crossing the line. So, yeah, back to point 1. You haven't proved that liberals are scientifically literate, only that they're slightly less illiterate than conservative, and that is not a win.

{"author":"killerofpain","body":"Point 1.)  I have never in my original post or comment that you originally replied to, claim that conservatives are irrational for believing in god. You were the one who first said that \"conservatives are not the ones looking up horoscopes\" in an attempt to prove that liberals are \"just as irrational\" for also holding unscientific beliefs. Which is when I brought up the fact that, conservatives are even more likely to believe in superstitions, by 23%. By bringing up liberals with horoscopes, you are the one who introduced a measure of scientific literacy based on willingness to believe in superstitions, and as I have proved, even under that measure, conservatives are less scientific literate while 15% more likely to believe in astrology, 23% less likely to believe in god. (Even though I don't agree with this measure).\n\nSo basically this was a counter point to your original response.\n\nPoint 2). So you basically just dismissed the legitimacy of the study, without providing additional data to contribute, and then claim that I haven't proven anything?  Ok, here's another study\n\n[https:\/\/docs.rwu.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=1069&amp;context=nyscaproceedings](https:\/\/docs.rwu.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=1069&amp;context=nyscaproceedings)\n\nRead the abstract. So based on all available studies, conservatives ARE less likely to vaccinate, or more likely to resist vaccinations.\n\nIf you are skeptical, or think that this is statistically up for debate, you are welcome to find research studies that counter these results.\n\nPoints 3). If you read my original response this was just one of many example of conservative being less trustful of the modern medicine, as evident by point 2.), and existence of conservative groups like christian science who straight out resist modern medicine, name me a dominantly liberal group that also reject modern medicines AND has resulted in numerous deaths. \n\nPoints 4:) I am in agreement that there are many liberals who are also scientific illiterate, but my point has always been that this is a more serious issue in conservative groups. (And if you read back to my main point, my major point for this had nothing to do with religion, or modern medicines, these are points that you brought up( with the horoscope and ointment) and I was merely showing you that even using measurement of scientific literacy by religion, and resistance to modern medicine, that's more of a conservative problem, not liberal.)\n\nPoint 5). This is actually a good place for me to reiterate my position. And the main argument for why I think conservatives, are less scientific literate, is that\n\n(A). As stated in my original post, conservatives are less likely to believe in human's significant contributions to climate change, even when presented with evidence, from my own experience, from studies, from many of my colleague's experience in the industry\/academia when advocating for policies that fight climate change.\n\n(B). Again, let me repeat, I was never the one who wanted to introduce religion as a measurement factor of scientific literacy. However, there IS a big difference, between believing that there is a god who created the universe, and believing the literal description of how earth was created to the point that you reject the scientific explanations and observable facts regarding the age of the universe, earth, and how lives evolved. 4 in 10 Americans are creationist who believe the earth was created 10000 years ago, this is unscientific, believing that earth was created by god, by causing the big bang and determining how every particles will be at a certain time is also unscientific as it goes against quantum mechanics. But, it shouldn't be debatable, that they are not EQUALLY WRONG. Just like saying the earth is spherical and straight up claiming earth is flat are not equally wrong or unscientific.  And most young earth creationists and people who reject evolution - the \"more wrong\" people, are likely to be conservatives.\n\nI am glad you take the patience to debate me.","created_utc":1533638886,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"nd20","body":"&gt;The federal program known as welfare delivers cash assistance to less than 1 percent of the United States population. This is far smaller than the share of those aided by food stamps, or by other government support like disability benefits, unemployment insurance, college grants and medical benefits.\n\n&gt;Americans have come to dislike government more and more, even as they have increasingly relied on its assistance through programs other than welfare. Americans are far less likely today than 40 years ago to say in surveys that they trust the government to do what is right or to look out for people like them. At the same time, the share of Americans using nearly all of these other programs has risen.\n\n&gt;In her surveys, Ms. Mettler has found that people typically say the programs they\u2019ve used have helped them. It seems reasonable to think that this sentiment might translate to appreciation for government \u2014 that the more programs people use, the more they might value the government that supplies them. But this is not what she found. Relying on government doesn\u2019t make people more likely to value government, or make them feel more strongly that government is responsive to them.\n\n&gt;Their feelings about government don\u2019t appear connected to their own direct experience of it. But those feelings are shaped by opinions about other people\u2019s reliance on government aid \u2014 specifically, on \u201cwelfare.\u201d\n\n&gt;People who strongly dislike welfare were significantly less likely to ***feel*** government had provided them with opportunities, or to ***feel*** government officials cared what they thought, regardless of how much they\u2019d relied on government programs themselves.\n\n&gt;\u201cTheir attitudes about welfare end up being a microcosm for them of government,\u201d Ms. Mettler said. \u201cThey look at how they think welfare operates, and if they see that as unfair, they think: \u2018This is basically what government is. Government does favors for undeserving people, and it doesn\u2019t help people like me who are working hard and playing by the rules.\u2019 \u201d","created_utc":1533649515,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

The first thing is that you are dealing with one aspect of life over a near infinite amount of others,  some are controllable and some aren't.  You are are an individual so while you fall under the sub group \"black person\" that's not the only thing that makes you you as race is not the only thing that makes a white person a person. A lot of aspects of our lives were just given to us that influences how others deal with you like height, physical proportionality, facial symmetry, mental health, sexuality, family life, ect. So everybody has a lot of different advantages and disadvantages they don't control and I don't at all doubt there are many disadvantages that come with being black but it's not one the worst cards to draw imo. Being white does make it easier to just kind of blend in here in America but it's not a guarentee everything in life is going to be easy.  People are still randomly shitty to me sometimes and I still had to work a bunch of shitty minimum wage jobs for over a decade. The collectivist mentality that the our race defines who we are as peoples is a bad way of looking at things.  The problem isn't *all white people have it great and all black people have it rough*, the problem is there are still racist individuals in power and that needs to corrected, pointing the finger at one giant group just divides us and makes these problems harder to solve. Racism was on the decline for centuries but I honestly think a lot of modern intersectional thinking is partially responsible for reversing that trend.\n\nTake it for what it's worth though,  my opinion isn't any more valuable than anyone else's I'm sure there is some stuff I'm getting wrong but I'm assuming this is more of the response you are looking for","created_utc":1533693207,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

That makes it more damaging than useful.\n\nTo elaborate, we look at \"all whites\" and see that trends emerge. We then look at, say, \"all blacks\" and see other trends. We then compare the trends and define the discrepancy as \"privilege.\" \n\nThat's useful. It helps us identify institutions that require closer examination. For example, there is no outwardly racist law in the judicial system, but we see disproportionate impact, so we examine laws to try to identify implicitly racist laws (e.g. crack vs. cocaine) or racial bias (e.g. juries, including black jurors, are harsher to blacks).\n\nThat's good stuff to explore. That is the concept of privilege helping us be better.\n\nBut, all too often, privilege becomes personal as it did in your prompt. You will not get 50% fewer callbacks than a white male with the same credentials because... no two people are the same. There isn't a white male with the same credentials. Privilege as the micro level is too imprecise to be useful. You don't know my backstory or my challenges or my anything (as I also do not know yours) to definitively say that I got something do to privilege that was denied to you. All humans are too granular to say, \"You got that because you're white!\" or \"You only got into medical school because you're black!\" \n\nWhile useful at the macro level, at the micro level it only serves to divide. At the micro level, that makes it not-useful, and, in fact, destructive. \n\nBecause we have other tools to help us at the macro level to identify racial disparity, and because it is destructive at the micro level, I reject it (while continuing to believe in it, if that makes sense).","created_utc":1533744131,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

The truth is that you guys honestly have no idea what the Midwest is about or what the Midwest even cares about. For one, we really really really could give two Fs about race. We find it so odd that every time a commentator on CNN talks about politics, they say something along the lines of we need the black vote to turn out here or there is a strong white vote turning out here. To us, it seems like liberals cannot go more than two seconds without bringing up race. The Midwest is very very diverse on politics, economics, race, ect... and we get along just fine with one another. Notice how all the batshit crazy antifa\/white supremists clashes happen in liberal cities on the coasts.\n\nIf you combine the economies of just Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, you get a larger economic powerhouse than California. Combine those states electoral votes and populations and you get more electoral power and a larger population than California. That is only half the states in the Midwest.\n\nSo three points:\n\n1. The Midwest is an economic and population powerhouse in this country, don't take us for granted.\n\n2. The coasts are arrogent. We are more than just \"flyover\" states. Also, why is everyone defined by race, gender, religion, or ethnicity. It is such a strange concept to assume that because someone is black, they are going to vote democrat. Put a little more emphasis on the individual guys.\n\n3.

It's going to be him misrepresenting her policies and expecting her to defend something she's not even calling for.  Then when she doesn't try to defend absurd accusations (like turning the US into Venezuela), he's going to claim victory and claim she's unwilling to defend her own positions, and tweet about it, and his crowd will eat that shit up.... because that's what gullible people do.\n\nThe only way to \"beat\" Ben Shapiro at Ben Shapiro's game is to drop to his level and actually play his game.   I would hope that AOC (and every other Democrat) is better than that.  She's not going to sit in a room with him while he spews  lies about her leaving her to defend these random things.  Literally nothing can be gained by doing that.\n\nShe should definitely debate her opponent, but as far as debating a far-right professional troll... nah, that's a huge waste of time with literally no benefit.\n\nThink of it this way... would you walk into a debate defending your desire to turn the US into Soviet Russia?

It's hard to overstate how much we just fucked ourselves.\n\nThere's a whole host of economic reasons for why we also want low-skilled immigrants, and it mostly surrounds the idea that barriers to movement restrict growth.

Fusion GPS was first contracted by a conservative political website, [*The Washington Free Beacon*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Washington_Free_Beacon), and Steele was not involved in that research. When Trump became the presumptive Republican Party presidential nominee on May 3, 2016, The *Free Beacon* stopped their backing. Separately, in April 2016, attorney [Marc Elias](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Marc_Elias) hired Fusion GPS to investigate Trump on behalf of [Hillary Clinton's campaign](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hillary_Clinton_presidential_campaign,_2016) and the [Democratic National Committee](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Democratic_National_Committee) (DNC). In June 2016, Fusion GPS subcontracted Steele to research and compile the dossier. Steele was hired without knowing, or ever having direct contact with, his ultimate clients,[\\[8\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier#cite_note-Mayer_3\/12\/2018-8) and his only instructions were to seek answers to this basic question: \"Why did Mr. Trump repeatedly seek to do deals in a notoriously corrupt police state that most serious investors shun?\"[\\[9\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier#cite_note-Simpson_Fritsch_1\/2\/2018-9) Senior Clinton campaign officials were reportedly unaware that Fusion GPS had subcontracted with Steele, and Steele was not told the Clinton campaign was the ultimate recipient of his research.[\\[10\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier#cite_note-Entous_Barrett_Helderman_10\/24\/2017-10)[\\[8\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier#cite_note-Mayer_3\/12\/2018-8) Following Trump's election as president, funding from Clinton and the DNC ceased, but Steele continued his research, and was reportedly paid directly by [Glenn R. Simpson](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Glenn_R._Simpson), a co-founder of Fusion GPS.[\\[11\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier#cite_note-Sampathkumar_8\/23\/2017-11) The completed dossier was then handed to British and American intelligence services.[\\[12\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier#cite_note-Perez_Prokupecz_Raju_4\/18\/2017-12)Weeks before the 2016 election, on the basis of Steele's reputation working on Russia-related matters for nearly 20 years, the FBI reached an agreement to pay Steele to continue his work, but the agreement was later terminated as information about the dossier became public.[\\[13\\]](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier#cite_note-Hamburger_2\/28\/2017-13)  \n\nSome of the dossier's allegations have been corroborated, while others remain unverified or may require access to classified information for verification. In February 2017, some details related to conversations \"solely between foreign nationals\" were independently verified. Some of those individuals were known to be \"heavily involved\" in efforts to damage Clinton and help Trump. The conversations \"took place between the same individuals on the same days and from the same locations as detailed in the dossier\", giving US intelligence and law enforcement \"greater confidence\" in the credibility of parts of the dossier.\n\nI am worried about this part of it.

{"author":"Idi_","body":"Hi! I'm really glad you're doing this (I might do something similar in a conservative reddit) because it is essential that we foster discussion rather than turn each other way. That's the only way we'll restore civility, humility, and bipartisanship, and I think that's a direction we all want to see.\n\nAnyways, answering the questions one by one,\n\n1. I believe and I hope one day liberals and conservatives will be able to talk again. We need to find ways to fight the partisanship that has been making politics so toxic, and it's good to have meaningful discussions such as these.\n\n2. All media has bias. Whether it's Fox News, MSNBC, CNN, Daily Wire, or whatever it may be. To be frank, the reason why I think some mainstream stuff that was considered independent are being viewed as bias is because they fact check and operate off facts, and unfortunately this current administration doesn't operate off facts. I try to consume a variety of news sources and commentary for my analysis of what's going on.\n\n3. I don't read the Constitution as a textualist or interpret it literally. What I do in regards to the Constitution is I take in account the history to accurately know what the Framers mean or intended. Take the Second Amendment for instance. The purpose was to arm the populous to be able to form a militia if necessary. There is now a disconnect because the structure and demands of a modern militia are very different than the ones used in 1787. I think because of this interpretation modern legislation on guns should take in account the ability for someone to enter a modern militia, and respecting the right to do so and own weapons, but also take in account public safety. With this view, things like a gun license or gun training courses before getting a gun is constitutional. I also read stuff like Section 8 of Article 1 loosely, so that Congress has reasonable power at the federal level unconstrained by semantics. \n\n4. I don't think the Democratic Party is embracing socialism per se, but there is a wing moving farther left. I think why this is happening is for a few reasons. One is just increasing partisanship: the democrats are moving left and the republicans are moving right. Another could be the economic concerns of many Americans. Wages have been stagnant, student debt is increasing, inequality is increasing, many people are concerned about offshoring, and etc. I think regular Americans are just open to more ideas, and particularly new ideas. \n\n5. I do have conservative friends, and I do talk to them! In the virtual world I'm usually surrounded by right wingers and in the physical world maybe a couple more left wingers but it's pretty balanced. \n\n6.  I do occasionally listen or read some right wing stuff. Occasionally I look at CATO Institute commentary, I used to watch PragerU (but stopped when it started moving very far right and distorting facts), I still sometimes peek at the Rubin Report, occasionally look at what Ben Shapiro have to say, and I used to look at what Milo said so I could respond or debunk his nonsense. I'm always reading or watching what some economists like Friedman or Hayek say as well, along with the more liberal ones. \n\n7. I generally support peaceful freedom of speech and thought for both right wing and left wing thinkers, and though there is a problem with how receptive campuses are to right wing views it's a lot smaller than what people think. For some people like Milo, it's honestly given because he's a troll that just tries to offend people. He's not someone who is just politically incorrect but someone that makes inflammatory personal attacks and generalizations on specific people or a liberal audience and tries to connect it so some loose but unclear political agenda. Other than specific examples like him, maybe Shapiro, some white nationalists, and a few other more extreme people, right wing views as far as I'm concerned are relatively fine and safely represented, albeit maybe less than left wing views. I know Georgetown University had a recent study that actually suggested liberal or left wing views or people were silenced more or fired more because of political views, but it's unobserved because the left doesn't have a Milo or a Shapiro to highlight that issue. All in all though, yes, we should protect speech and advocate campuses to be safe spaces for any speech. \n\n8. Depends what are conservative views. For example, I'm a capitalist! I suppose that's right wingy lol. On a lot of hot button issues I am moderate and compromising, but I am liberal. I'm pro-choice, pro-LGBT, and pro moderate gun control for instance. I would like to be more involved in my religious community I suppose. \n\n9. Yee we can be friends. I love talking politics and to people with different views, so message anytime.

These programs have legitimacy because, in the end, their authority is derived from the people. We elected people and told them we want a military. We want police. We want social security.\n\n**No. The government formed the Continental Army with a resolution of congress. It was not voted upon by the people. Police forces were a different story, and were formed by the city municipals, not the people, in order to control the \"disorder\" during urbanization in the mid 1800s. Social security is a socialist program - you don't opt-in, the government takes the money from your check, you have no autonomy over your money, plus, there are zero dollars in the social security fund.\n\n&gt; Is everything perfect?

It\u2019s not strictly mainstream media though, all media has a bias and that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s false. \n\n3. I don\u2019t read the constitution in originalist views because it\u2019s a document written in old English 200+ years ago when the world was different. I don\u2019t believe we can stick rigidly to a document that old and try to draw out how it could apply to issues that didn\u2019t exist 5 years ago let alone 200 years ago.

I\u2019ll read their articles and see what they think but it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s the same talking points repeateded endlessly. \n\n7. Universities are supposed to be inclusive welcoming places for thoughts and ideas. It\u2019s to intellectually challenge your stance and articulate and defend your views. At my school, Milo Yiannopolos is there to instigate and spark a reaction. I remember seeing nooses near a hall with mainly black students.

It wasn\u2019t about finding what you want to stand for it became who was gonna be the loudest and become the victim. \n\n8. I find myself moderate but I can sympathize with conservatives on different issues. I\u2019m not against whatever they\u2019re for just because they are in favor of them. But it depends on the issue. \n\n9. I\u2019d love to be friends with conservatives. I just got banned from the subreddit because I suppose I came off a little tensely but I was needling for a genuine counter argument or reasoning. (It was about John Brennan and his security clearance, he open,y acknowledged he voted for a communist candidate in one race in college as a kind of protest vote and someone said that should have disqualified him from ever receiving security clearance. I described it as a 3rd wave of McCarthyism. Then I was labeled a globalist and liberal elite, and I asked why does having a different vision for the future of the country make me a villain.

Several participants in the meeting told Times reporters that they did not recall the president using those words and did not think he had, but the two officials who described the comments found them so noteworthy that they related them to others at the time\n\nLiterally most of these are he insulted someone who wasn't white so he's racist.\n\nEdit: 100% agree on you with the environment, trump literally called global warming a hoax.

Somehow according to some people on the left, I am a part of the problem. \n\nThe issue you guys have is like, prior to the vegas shooting, no one on the left knew what a bump stock was, but the NRA had already said that they should come under congressional review. So its funny, no one on the left had an issue with bump sticks until vegas, because the left likes to hate on guns but you guys are for the most part not educated on them. However the NRA said these could become an issue and we need to decide how to regulate these or not allow them, or whatever. So congress never reviewed them despite the NRA asking them to, but I turn on CNN and apparently the NRA is the reason bump stocks are rampant and everywhere. Curious how that works out. Im not a trump supporter, cannot stand him for the record, but he also asked congress for them to do something about bump stocks. \n\nAs a matter of fact, the 2nd amendment is not mythical, its an actual thing.

I won't have time to collect several 10 round magazines and load them into my bulletproof vest so I can access them rapidly, I might be half asleep, I could be confused if it is a family member or drunk neighbor coming into the wrong house, I don't know how many people it might be or if they also have firearms.  None of these disadvantages apply to someone planning a mass murder, especially if they select a location where they know people will be grouped and unarmed.  \n\nThe most important part of a magazine in a gun used for self-defense is its reliability, which is why you don't see the army or police using what I consider \"high capacity magazines\".  Those drum magazines that hold 50-100 rounds.  You are correct though, a larger magazine does make a gun more effective so long as it doesn't affect reliability, but those advantages can largely be mitigated with advanced planning.  \n\n&gt;I truly hope you don\u2019t need any bullets ever to protect yourself in your home. I\u2019m grateful to live somewhere where I don\u2019t have the fear that I need to own a gun.\n\nI agree.  I also live in a very safe, upper-middle-class home.  I certainly don't own a gun because I'm in fear, but I also know the police response time would be 5 to 10 minutes.  It would be a nightmare hearing someone break in and having to reach for my nightstand gun.  That is not a position I want to be in, the only worse position I can imagine would be to be helpless.  If that position is going to be forced on me, I'd want every unfair advantage in a fight I can get.  \n\nI agree with everything you said in your last paragraph.

It because it raises the cost of living.\n\nFor example Chinese milk costs 1.00 and American milk costs 3.00. If a Chinese milk tariff is placed on china, the Chinese milk now costs 4.00, so rhe cheapest is now the American at 3.00. So the cheapest option increased by 2.00.\n\n&gt;And for the cabinet picks, \u201cWhy wouldn't he pick people who wouldn't help him for cabinet positions\u201d\n\n&gt;It\u2019s about the people he\u2019s picking idiot \ud83d\ude02\n\n&gt;If he puts Rex Tillerson, Betsy DeVos, Scott Pruitt in power what\u2019s that say about trump?

That is what I\u2019m saying, let me get you some quotes from your own article \u201cit is being sold as a middle-class tax cut but the benefits for such families will expire in 2025 while the corporate tax cuts are permanent,\"\n\nIts like talking to a brick wall, yes but it still benefits the middle class a far cry from what you said earlier \"I wonder who\u2019s going to have to make that up \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 (the middle class)\" the middle class isn't making anything up for them.

Which is total bullshit, there are plenty of other programs to slash or new sources of income that could be exploited.\n\nhttp:\/\/time.com\/money\/5071344\/gop-tax-bill-middle-class\/\nWhat GOP says: You\u2019ll get a tax cut.\nPutting aside President Trump\u2019s penchant for exaggeration, independent analysts agree the Republican bill would deliver a tax cut for the majority of Americans. In 2018, middle-income households \u2014 those earning $49,000 to $86,000 \u2014 will see an average tax cut of $930 on average, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Those who make a bit more but might still plausibly be called middle class \u2014 families earning $86,000 to $149,000 \u2014 will get back even more, with an average tax cut of just over $1,800.\n\nWhat you should know: It\u2019s only temporary.\nNot if the new legislation gets passed\n\nWhat the GOP says: Taxes are getting simpler.\nThey did, but they are not that simple.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2017\/11\/28\/upshot\/what-the-tax-bill-would-look-like-for-25000-middle-class-families.html\n\nAt max articles this month cant get into it\n\nhttps:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/news\/news-desk\/the-republican-tax-plan-contains-more-middle-class-pain-than-even-its-critics-are-saying\nI actually have no problems with this one\n\nhttps:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/12\/19\/571754894\/charts-see-how-much-of-gop-tax-cuts-will-go-to-the-middle-class\n\nFIRST PARAGRAPH, supports exactly what I have been saying.\n\nThe Republican tax bill, which Congress sent to President Trump on Wednesday, would give most Americans a tax cut next year, according to a new analysis. However, it would by far benefit the richest Americans the most. Meanwhile, many lower- and middle-class Americans would have higher taxes a decade from now ... unless a future Congress extends the cuts.\n\nThe plain and simple fact is that IT IS a tax cut for the middle class, it is also a big tax cut for the rich and corporations.

It's been very, very difficult to find someone on the right I can say the same things about, but I'd like to (if anyone has a suggestion).\n\nI just saw Jordan Peterson mentioned as well, and I've only heard very lucid-seeming things from him but I'm aware he is controversial for some of his opinions in Canada.  Granted, I don't have a ton of exposure but I was surprised to see his named dropped in a negative context.\n\nIf we are looking at people as enemies for their willingness to give people platforms to speak, we pretty much have to dismiss everyone up to and including NPR and that's a ridiculous idea to me on its face.  I get that you don't want to see ugly views elevated in any way but sometimes it's impossible to have an actual discussion about those kinds of views without having them represented authentically.\n\nI have always had the impression that Rogan is somewhat conservative but open-minded.  He seems willing to actually hold discussion about things and is curious.  You can't really say that about ideological sycophants who make up a large part of the media landscape (on all sides - sorry for the Trumpism but that's just true, though far more true for one side).\n\nIf there is an enemy, it is people who clearly know they are attacking the truth with propaganda.

Harris, Rogan, Peterson... these don't seem like people who deserve to be put in the same group as those others.  It strikes me as too zealous to be seeking enemies to name.

{"author":"Mr_Reyman","body":"This got lengthy, I'm sorry for that, but I hope I explained a different way of seeing things. \n\nThe point of social programs isn't necessarily to make the poor rich. ( And I'll add now, before getting to carried away that we also have plenty of programs and systems in this country designed to help the rich financially that are also horribly abused, but never seem to fall under that same amount of scrutiny by conservatives, but I won't press on that) \n\nIn one way or another there will always be poor people (or at least poorer people) in a capitalistic society and this isn't necessarily a bad thing. \n\nThe problem is when imbalances within a system allow people the get so poor that they are unable to escape this poverty or even forced to live (and sometimes die) on the street.\n\nNot everyone has to be rich and not everyone is content being poor. But no one should be chastised or seen as \"the problem\" just for being poor.\n\nThe liberal approach I believe you're talking of is just the belief that no one should be so poor that they die on the streets or can't afford too eat. And since we're the largest economy on the planet, this is most certainly within our means.\n\nI do agree that the execution of these programs is not always on point and that the system we live in is extremely complex and difficult to fully see in any single sweeping gaze, but helping the poor is not always about helping them get rich. Sometimes, when other parts of the system are failing the people, helping the poor is just about giving them a hand. \n\nI frankly feel like conservatives demonize the lazy and the poor as if they'll bring down this country, but the lazy achieve very little and the poor have little power, so I don't believe this to be true. But if your greatest criticism of liberalism is that people will be lazy, allow me to point to my criticism of conservative values that literally allow people to die on the street homeless and hungry. I think between these two, I'd rather have lazy people living comfortably. \n\nA single question to leave you with, if I might be so bold, would be: if you don't see a reason in helping each other, what reason can you see in government? \nIf the answer falls back on tradition and moral values, then I would say you're reasoning for government is more like the reasoning for a religion, and that should be a  frightening realization for anyone.

People who can afford to move away do. And it just so happens the people who can afford it are white.\n\nIn my experience as a white man from a working class family, we lived in between two worlds.\n\nGo east and you drive into a poor inner city neighborhood with notoriously high crime and poor school districts.\n\nDrive West and you were heading towards the wealthy area with lots of rich white and asian families. \n\nI was lucky enough that even though our family didn't make a lot of money we still managed to live in a location that I went to school with the rich kids. Meaning my school had amazing funding and great educational programs. \n\nOur school was almost entirely white. But thanks to school of choice we also had families coming in who were from the east side of town. They drove an hour commute just to attend our school. And thank god they did because they never stood a chance in their own district. \n\nSo my school actually got more diverse because of school choice. School choice lowers the financial barriers required to change your child's school district if it's no longer working out. You don't have to purchase a new house. You just have to spend a little extra in gas\/bus fare.","created_utc":1534353079,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

And it's better for students if they can go to school in their neighborhood and actually be able to play with fellow students outside of school. Being able to bond with students outside of the school has a positive impact on academics. \n\nThe less financial and social risk a family has to undergo in order to leave a bad school district, the better.","created_utc":1534355812,"score":0,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

There seems to be a lot of take from the government here without much of the reward. Taxes are high on everything, spending seems too liberal in all the wrong areas. The thought of paying more taxes has me wary to back many of the Democrats in the polls here as my taxes are many times over what they were in California (at least for property taxes) without the social rewards, programs, school efficiency or environmental\/neighborhood preservation that I saw in California. For example, obviously I voted Democrat in the govenor election but I am not in support of the immediate cry for a raise in taxes and a few other pushes as there is a lot to be corrected for taxes are the answer in this particular case.\n\nI guess that's my rambling 2 cents.

And, both sides take sometimes opposite positions regarding what the facts of an issue is, and what a law means.   In the view of many liberals, Judge Kavanaugh, regardless of the examples you mention, and others, has demonstrated a willingness to try to change rules and customs in this country that are foundational for a liberal society.   That in itself is sufficient to push back as hard as possible.  Compare this with Justice Gorsuch, who was regarded as conservative (and his to-date record bears this out), but was and is regarded as a jurist, more respectful of existing law and precedent. \n\nThird, many conservatives complain that the judiciary is willing to 'make law', which is somewhat encouraged by liberal thinking.  Judge Kavanaugh is a conservative who wants to use the bench to 'make law'.  This offends the left the same way the opposite offends the right.  \n\nShall I continue?

It wouldn't be just for Republican presidents, it would be for all presidents. Once again, even if there is a precedent set about whether a sitting President can be subpoenaed or not, it doesn't really affect whether or not said President can be impeached and removed from office. Once out of office, the man can then be subpoenaed. It is not the worst thing in the world. Again, I think it is still a very unfounded fear as well because most likely more than 4 justices don't agree with Kavanaugh's view here. So if Trump is subpoenaed, the Supreme Court will most likely set precedent that sitting President's can be subpoenaed effectively rendering Kavanaugh's views on this issue irrelevant.\n\n3.

The air stank with sweat and urine. Right then, I began to reconsider everything that I thought I knew about Canadian health care. I soon discovered that the problems went well beyond overcrowded ERs. Patients had to wait for practically any diagnostic test or procedure, such as the man with persistent pain from a hernia operation whom we referred to a pain clinic\u2014with a three-year wait list; or the woman needing a sleep study to diagnose what seemed like sleep apnea, who faced a two-year delay; or the woman with breast cancer who needed to wait four months for radiation therapy, when the standard of care was four weeks.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.city-journal.org\/html\/ugly-truth-about-canadian-health-care-13032.html\n\nAs for the car insurance thing, you have wildly misinterpreted what I said. I think that is should be optional, I didn\u2019t say that it should be for the person that caused the accidnt, i said that it should be optional and that it\u2019s your fault if you get in an accident without insurance and it should be your responsibility.\n\nI actually said the opposite about more people buying and becoming more expensive and ineffective. When more people buy it makes it less expensive and more effective, specifically when it is deregulated. Just look at lasik eye surgery. It went down from about 20k an eye to about 2k an eye. This is because insurance won\u2019t cover it, it\u2019s basically a free market. This causes more doctors to go into it because they can charge whatever they want. When more doctors enter the field, there\u2019s a lot of competition and the doctors will make the treatment more effective and less expensive in order to get more customers. The open market increases the quality in every market. That\u2019s not even controversial.\n\nBut if you\u2019d like to socialize healthcare, be my guest.

{"author":"Gavinlw11","body":"I realise this is a little late but I would be interested in a response if you happen to see the notification.\n\nI assume that, being a conservative you support general deregulation of Corporations, Banks, Wall St. Ect. My point is that whenever we have tried this in the past, it leads to what is known as a boom-bust cycle. The 1920s provide one of the best examples, where massive deregulation did lead to huge economic growth, and prosperity, but only for the handful of years leading up to the the great depression. You may say that the great depression was caused by external factors, such as the dust bowl, and they certainly played a part in making it so potent, but there are plenty of other examples of similar situations, though not as extreme. President Raegen did massive deregulation, causing the economy to go into a recession shortly after, and again  under Bill Clinton, and George w. (Though Bush did most of the deregulation) leading into the great recession. So how can you, knowing this, still support conservative economic policies? \n\nAdditionally, i would be curious to hear your opinion on Trump's economy, often cited as where he is having the most success. (Unemployment down, stock market on the rise) But what do you say to the fact that wages are down? And to the fact that, looking at the graphs, Obama saw growth just as large or larger at many points throughout his presidency?\n\nAnd a final question, related to the second one, do you think the health of the economy has a direct correlation with the well-being and happiness of the American people?\n\n","created_utc":1534861892,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"trumpet_69","body":"Ok, thank you for your question. First of all, the Great Depression was linked to a bunch of other things, you\u2019re right. Here\u2019s a good article about that: http:\/\/www.ushistory.org\/us\/48.asp\n\nAs for the other times, often, the choices of government has less to do with the economy than the companies individual choices do. I can\u2019t explain it well in a short amount of time, but if you\u2019d like, do some digging and you\u2019ll find some really good articles. The reason that I support conservative policies on economy is because they increase competition, which increases quality and decreases price. Just look at lasik eye surgery. Massively deregulated and so the effectiveness has gone up drastically recently and the price has dropped from 20000 dollars and eye to about 2000 dollars an eye.\n\nObama had a advantage to his growth statistics. He started as low as the economy can go and there was a lot of opportunity for growth there. And I probably agree with you regarding policies after a recession, government intervention often does a lot of good. Which is why obama has an optimal situation, low economy that needed regulation. Trump however, is just seeing the effect of deregulation on the economy.\n\nRegarding your final question, I think it often should have a lot to do with the happiness and wellbeing, but I don\u2019t think that our expectations are fair, and that kind of sets us up for failure. After deregulation, profits are put into development of new products or optimizing old ones instead of into our pockets, which is a good thing, because the development boosts the economy, and makes us all better off in the end game. So to sum up, yes it should make us happier, but our expectations are in the wrong area. \n\nIf I missed anything, let me know, thanks again","created_utc":1534918199,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

Prior to the election it was a lot of hyperbole and speculation.\n\nLets flip it and say the presidential election is this November and he was on the ballot. No I don't think I could vote for him, but I never WANTED to in the first place. I never once thought \"Boy this guy is going to be a eloquent as Obama and just a good all around guy\". No, I pretty much knew this was gonna be a very chaotic presidency and that he had questionable morals. But I still wouldn't vote for Hillary. I'd write in Bernie or some other person. I just didn't agree with how she railroaded Bernie and I didn't agree with ANY of her views. Once she shoved Bernie out of the running via her teamwork with the DNC I refused to enough contemplate voting for her. It was whatever ended up on the Republican ballot, or no vote at all.\n\nI personally find myself more along the vane of Rand Paul. Some of his tax ideas really stuck with me even though it was going to be very detrimental to my state for sales tax reasons. Once he dropped I was rooting for Rubio because I thought he could be the most presidential. As the Republicans thinned and I really thought Trump was going on the ballot I honestly really hoped Bernie would take out Hillary and I probably would have voted for him. I can honestly say that I didn't really feel excited to go vote at all, but I really didn't want to see HRC win.\n\nIn hindsight, did I expect him to be this much of a loose cannon?  No. I expected the rank and file to help keep him under control a bit more, so I guess thats my fault for having too much faith in the rest of Congress etc.\n\nBut i still stand with what I chose that day because I felt the changes made would most align with ideals.

The poor have no such option and it's exactly what happened in communist states when they tried wealth redistribution, it doesn't work when the highest earners leave and take their business with them.\nAnd if it is lost on a Marxist, taxes are by percentage in the first place and scaled to income already; 20% of 20000 and 400000 Dollars is going to be the same proportion of money taken by the government as a part of earning money. If you increase the percentage for top earners (which already sits around 40%) all you get is a mysterious amount of top earners relocating their assets and businesses elsewhere because it becomes uneconomical to live in a country where the government takes most of their money.\n\nAnd expanding jobs is not the problem, human capital is found through people being industrious, and level of education\/training is the first step to doing so. Contrary to defining a 'livable' wage (Where essential needs like food and utilities should be met and include a small disposable income after taxation), places like trade schools should be considered as important as universities and the level of education children receive should be standardised. Heavy industries like mining, energy, construction and farming should be opened up as a career path as opposed to schools being segways into universities where entirely different skillsets are learned (As Liberal arts degrees are entirely worthless in the workplace while STEM subjects have become among the highest earning and most competitive industries).\nRaising human capital is the best way to lead to a rise in wages, wealth and the government gets additional tax income to then invest back into the country in sectors like the military, public services and even allow the possibility of better healthcare or even minimum standard healthcare. If a majority of people is earning more than they're recieving over a lifetime (even when the cost of retirement is held against them) and following generations inherit that wealth, you get a much stronger economy and a political powerhouse of a country.","created_utc":1535095936,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"Sun-Shiney","body":"It's impossible to get a complete news story today where one walks away from the giving of the facts to form one's own conclusion.  And there's a reason for that.   Before 1990, research shows that less than 49 percent of people could determine which party made a congressional speech when the source was hidden.  After that date, the number has grown to nearly 75 percent.  Why? It's because of a language approach called \"framing.\"  \n\nFraming of the news was never taught until recently. I taught newswriting, interviewing and more at two universities.   Framing links word choice with a group's most deeply held beliefs.  Given the difference between beliefs and perceptions (which lead to attitudes and opinion formation), flappable situations result.  It is the polarization we now experience. \n\nThere was a time when all watched news together.  The use of framing has made that near impossible.  Word choices, unconsciously, excite a deep part of our beings.  \n\nInstead, we need to return to being able to have substantive discussions, arguments on topics.  That's only possible when our language changes to the use of phrases that both sides find agreeable.  Then we move away from emotional reactions to reasoned discussion.   Until then, every time you send a meme you are not persuading, you are not changing viewpoints of anyone.  Intead, we are simply stimulating passions.  The result?

In general, I'd say private associations have a reasonable right to, within their own walls, set standards for what type of speech is to be permitted. In society, however, an expansive view of free speech is best. Most rich countries, despite what you may think, actually do have quite liberal laws protecting free speech, and no one is seriously legislating a right to avoid offence (that I'm aware of).\n\nRe: Canada, I think you should ask the folks over at \/r\/canadapolitics to explain the actual content of the bills put forth in Canada. As I understand it, they only applied to employees in federal offices and things like that (see again private associations - as an employer, or providing services to the public, they can insist on more stringent standards).

{"author":"Aristox","body":"&gt;in my eyes, and a lot of people\u2019s eyes, the flag must be shown utmost respect\n\nAt the end of the day this is a just a stupid thing to believe. If the flag doesn't represent any actual deep principles and ideas it's just a piece of cloth. If it does represent some deep principles then the point of the protest is to protest the **country** for not living up to those ideals. The flag doesn't have feelings, it can't get offended.\n\nIf someone values what the flag stands for, then they'll agree with the complaints of the protesters. If they don't value the principles the flag stands for then they have no right getting offended on behalf of the flag, cause then it's nothing more than a cloth\n\n&gt; I\u2019m saying if you\u2019d like to protest, please find a different way to do it, there are many better ways that aren\u2019t as disrespectful.\n\nTo say this in the face of people who are literally getting beaten and killed is just the absolute height of privilege, and is frankly indefensible. The constitution is meant to grant certain rights to the citizens of the country. And if certain citizens aren't being allowed to truly enjoy those rights then that is a MUCH bigger problem with society than whatever importance someone could place on a flag being disrespected.\n\nPeople trying to fix the problem have no duty to prioritise the feelings of some particularly patriotic people over the protection of the rights guaranteed in the foundational document of the country's law. The latter is clearly more important. The only reason someone would demand protests take place in a way that protects the flag from possible disrespect is if they have the luxury of not having to worry about their rights being deprived, so they can worry about smaller things.\n\nThe only way someone can see the injustices going on against US citizens and not think a little 'flag disrespect' is an acceptable price to pay for the defence of the fundamental liberties at the core of the country, is if they really don't care about protecting what America was created to be and don't know or care what it actually means to be an American. \n\n**There are people who fought and laid down their lives for the freedom and values America was built upon. And then there are people who will sit idly by as their fellow citizens are murdered and unfairly treated, and demand only that they suffer their mistreatment quietly and without disturbing them or 'disrespecting' the flag. The former are patriots, the latter the opposite of patriots. They're freeloaders who'll take whatever benefits of the society they were born into, but have no actual commitment to the constitution or the values of the country. They might put in some effort to support their own particular sub group in their local area, but they aren't really committed to America herself.**\n\nWhat makes it extra shameful is that it's often these posers who will shout the loudest about how patriotic they are, despite being further from it than nearly anyone else","created_utc":1535253766,"score":3,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"LittleKitty235","body":"&gt;Cars are almost required in today's society. Guns, on the other hand, are not required in any way to succeed in this society.\n\nVideo games and music are not required by society, but both have a culture as well.  Most hobbies have a culture. Guns and car cultures are no different.  If something has a culture or not has no bearing on how useful it is for society to function.  \n\nI think you are also ignoring most or rural America, where guns are a practical tool to have.  When I lived in NYC owning a car was definitely not required or even desirable.  You are applying what is useful to you, and assuming the same rules apply to all 325 million Americans.\n\n&gt;Those who buy guns are specifically inserting themselves into a culture that takes pride in owning something used to kill. Guns are only for people who like violence while cars can be owned by anyone and are not for any one type of person.\n\nWell, that is absurd.  You are either lying to yourself or just repeating something you heard.  Most gun owners are not violent and have no interest in killing anything, apart from hunters.  That is a strawman argument.  You set up a false premise to defend your conclusion.  \n\n&gt;Specific types of cars, yes can have a culture, but motor vehicles, in general, are not the same as guns.\n\nMy dad likes cars, specifically anything MOPAR, I had to go to a lot of car shows as a kid.  I can assure you there is definitely a large group of people who like cars of all types and will talk to you for hours about it.

{"author":"Abelfazel","body":"&gt;Once again, compelled speech is absolutely controversial. Telling people not to wear bike shorts to work is completely different from compelling them to utter certain words and then making it punishable by law to refuse compliance.\n\nOkay. I like the idea of taking for granted that speech should be as free as possible. Then, in which instances do we restrict it? Direct incitement to violence, and cases of slander, seem pretty uncontroversial, as they cause direct harm. Beyond that, some countries restrict \"hate speech\" which, if defined restrictively enough, I don't think is beyond the pale. Let's say this is our gold standard for an open society.\n\nIn the case of private associations, you don't seem to have a problem with them restricting speech among their own members. (Prohibiting speech restriction among self-selecting groups would itself be quite illiberal - they can restrict *themselves* if they want to).\n\nNow, the point I am making is that there are two separate roles of government here. Role 1 of government is as guarantor of our liberal, open society. In this case, their role is to ensure that our \"gold standard\" of free speech is protected. Again, I think we're all on board for that. Role 2 of government is as provider of services: police, health, education, etc. We all should agree that these are important functions of government.\n\nWithin the capacity of Role 2, the \"government\" operates effectively as an office or business - very different from the agora-type space where it's just citizens interacting and going about their business. The government actually has a job to do. Thus, citizens in the employ of the government while it is carrying out these functions are not just citizens wandering around the agora. They are employees, and, like private associations, the proper functioning of the organisations may require some restrictions that only apply within the confines of that association.\n\nMoreover, providing these services to all citizens equally, and without prejudice, requires reasonable restrictions on those providing the services. It doesn't take any mental exertion at all to think of an inappropriate behaviour that would prevent a doctor, police officer, teacher, or bureaucrat from providing a service to citizens effectively and without prejudice. I've already given examples. Moreover, if the government weren't to compel people to behave a certain way *while providing these services*, the only way to fulfil its obligation to provide equal services to citizens would be to discriminate by only hiring people who did not need to be compelled to behave this way in the first place (an even more illiberal policy than saying \"this is how we talk to people we're providing services to\").\n\nSo, let's take for granted that the idea of compelling speech is controversial - I think it is. In the case of government employees providing services, I think we've seen why it doesn't violate our idea of how free speech should function in a society to allow for the government to insist on certain speech by its employees that go beyond not inciting violence or slandering.\n\n&gt;Free speech was what we stood for as liberals. Why have so many forgotten this? Are you that clouded by the obvious extreme-leftist criticisms of Jordan Peterson? Have you not done any actual research?\n\nNot an argument, so I'll disregard this.\n\n&gt;Judging by this completely empty reply, I see you didn't read a single line of what I said.\n\nI said it is reasonable for government-as-employer to compel speech. You said that federal employees are citizens and not private employees, and so it is still inappropriate for the government to compel their speech (it seems by virtue of being \"the government\", since there's no other justification given). I then refuted this, not with \"legal experts told him this repeatedly\" (this was actually from the post *you* were responding to - while we're on the topic of who \"actually read\" what). My actual response to you was that the government-as-employer must compel speech in certain instances, gave reasonable examples, which in my view addressed your central point, which seems to be that on principle the government should in no case be involved in compelling speech. So, if I wasn't reading a single line, let's just say I'm a very good guesser then.\n\n&gt;This also means you didn't actually read the bill, you didn't listen to what Jordan said about the bill, and you are simply speaking out the back hole.\n\nMy first post on this topic was recommending that OP look up what was actually in the bill. Have *you* read it? I don't see you contradicting anything I've said about it (which was that my impression was that it only required its employees to use citizens' preferred gender pronouns while interacting with them). So what's the issue? Jordan Peterson apparently didn't read the bill, as it was pointed out to him repeatedly by a legal expert that what he was complaining about wasn't even in the bill (look up the discussion on TVO's The Agenda. It's on YouTube.).\n\nHere's an [article](https:\/\/medium.com\/s\/story\/a-field-guide-to-jordan-petersons-political-arguments-312153eac99a) summarising the Canadian and Ontario laws that Peterson misinterprets. You don't have to agree with the author, but the burden of proof is on you to show that Peterson is correct in what he thinks is actually in the laws. It also links to other instances of legal experts pointing out how he is mistaken.\n\nLastly, before you get back to me all hoppin' mad watching these Peterson debates, remember what our actual subject is here (hint: it's not whether or not professors should be compelled to call their students \"ze\"). The subject is *does the Canadian and Ontarian human rights legislation compel Peterson, or other citizens, to use certain language*. (Apparently it doesn't even demand this within his capacity as a professor, though as I've argued above, I don't think a guideline for public sector employees to use he\/her\/first name is actually beyond the pale.) Don't bother replying to me complaining about the self-righteous left-wing politics in the Medium article, since it has nothing to do with anything.","created_utc":1535640881,"score":1,"subreddit":"Liberal"}

{"author":"DeadHonor","body":"Quick summary from wikipeida:\n\n\"The bill is intended to protect individuals from discrimination within the sphere of federal jurisdiction and from being the targets of hate propaganda,[5]\u00a0as a consequence of their gender identity or their gender expression. The bill adds \"gender identity or expression\" to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination in the Canadian Human Rights Act and the list of characteristics of identifiable groups protected from hate propaganda in the Criminal Code. It also adds that evidence that an offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on a person's gender identity or expression constitutes an aggravating circumstance for a court to consider when imposing a criminal sentence.\"\n\n\"The law amends the\u00a0Criminal Code\u00a0by adding \"gender identity or expression\" to the definition of \"identifiable group\" in section 318.[8][9]\u00a0Section 318 makes it a criminal offence to advocate or promote\u00a0genocide against members of an identifiable group, which now includes gender identity or\u00a0gender\u00a0expression. Since the definition of \"identifiable group\" is also used in s 319 of the Code, the amendment also makes it a criminal offence to incite or promote hatred because of gender identity or gender expression.[10]\nThe law also adds \"gender identity or expression\" to section 718.2 of the Criminal Code.[11]\u00a0This section is part of the sentencing provisions and makes gender identity and gender expression an aggravating factor in sentencing, leading to increased sentences for individuals who commit crimes motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on gender identity or expression.\"\n\nBias, prejudice and\/or hate will have to be determined in court, but it is clear as glass that it is punishable under the criminal code of the Human Rights Commission. You can use your imagination to determine how this would play out for a federal employee who refused to use the preferred gender identity or expression of someone.\n\nMaybe you have faith that some sort of reason would prevail and people would not be punished to the full extent of this law, but the fact that the pathway there has been laid should make you wary.\n\n&gt;In the case of private associations, you don't seem to have a problem with them restricting speech among their own members. (Prohibiting speech restriction among self-selecting groups would itself be quite illiberal - they can restrict themselves if they want to).\n\nWe agree here.\n\nPrivate companies can restrict or compel whatever they want. That doesn't make it morally right. Google went too far when they fired James Damore. Google will, hopefully, suffer the consequences from such actions internally. Externally, people simply will not stop using their products and put social pressure on them to change. Facebook employees seem to be uniting against restrictions on free speech. I do not think the government should force them to change their policies, even if I believe them to be incredibly misguided. \n\nJordan is well aware that the law applied to federal employees. He argued that this law is the  first time in Western history that a federal government compelled speech. He is right. He then predicted the law would eventually extend outwards and that organizations would begin to act in accordance simply because the law exists. \n\nIt then happened at Wilfrid Laurier University when the administration tried to silence their student, Lindsey Shepherd, and punish her for merely trying to debate the topic.\n\nJordan Peterson's own Toronto University also sent him a letter from their \"legal-experts\" who also interpreted the law and tried to cut ties between them and their own tenured professor. For speaking about it. \n\nDoes this not ring any warning bells in your head?\n\n\n&gt;Moreover, if the government weren't to compel people to behave a certain way while providing these services, the only way to fulfil its obligation to provide equal services to citizens would be to discriminate by only hiring people who did not need to be compelled to behave this way in the first place (an even more illiberal policy than saying \"this is how we talk to people we're providing services to\").\n\nOR.. do not make laws based on false ideological claims about sex and gender. \n\nYou seem to be laser focused on \"providing services\". If we are going to play that game, then fine, compelling action and forcing employees to follow strict guidelines to provide services is the ultimate solution. Zero unhappy consumers! Problem solved! \n\nBut greater problems arise when these laws violate basic human rights that affect the people outside of the \"services\" scope. This specific law may not target everyday citizens, but it is a definite \"foot in the door\". That is what Jordan Peterson argued, and it was definitely not a total \"crock of shit\". \n\nYou seem capable of more than elementary thought, yet you seem to not understand this:\n\nCompelling speech through force and making non-compliance punishable by law is completely and utterly wrong, no matter what sugar-coating you want to put on it.

{"author":"Abelfazel","body":"Thanks for the detailed reply. I think we agree on more than we disagree on here. Historically, the Supreme Court has had a very high bar for how \"hateful\" speech must be to warrant any restrictions, so this isn't something that's really under attack in Canada.\n\nMore importantly, the federal bill only added gender identity to the list of things, like race and sexual orientation, that could identify a group for hate speech. So one might have a problem with the hate speech laws in Canada, but this particular law doesn't change anything about hate speech laws in general and so shouldn't be the focus of any particular objection (like Peterson makes).\n\nThere are a few other relevant points here. Firstly, the university lawyers intervening and asking Peterson to use people's pronouns - *or their first names *, which was also recommended - just looks like standard ass-covering and isn't particularly insidious. Similarly, the story at WLU was widely ridiculed and as far as I know the student didn't face any state sanctions. You could say that free speech is being threatened within university culture, and there is a case to be made for that argument, but it doesn't really apply to Canadian law per se. The free speech assault is far worse in US liberal arts colleges than Canadian universities, despite US law having a more expansive view of free speech than Canada does. To me, this shows that campus culture and human rights legislation don't necessarily move in lockstep.\n\nApparently, the Ontario human rights tribunal story is a bit more complicated. [This](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/JordanPeterson\/comments\/6fli34\/did_jbp_misinterpret_bill_c16\/dij5ja8\/) is a pretty informative Reddit conversation I found on \/r\/jordanpeterson about the topic at large. The validity of the interpretation, particularly with respect to the Ontario Human Rights Code, is discussed [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/JordanPeterson\/comments\/85ngqw\/lets_discuss_petersons_argument_that_the_ontario\/).\n\n[This](http:\/\/www.ohrc.on.ca\/en\/questions-and-answers-about-gender-identity-and-pronouns) seems to answer our question directly as well.\n\nIn general, I think there is scant evidence that free speech is threatened by Canada's amendments to its laws. I also think that Jordan Peterson misrepresents how threatened and oppressed he is, and ignores the advice of legal experts who tell him otherwise. Part of this confusion results from the fact that laws are written, but then must be *interpreted*. However, our legal tradition has always been this way and it's probably for the best. Also, note that the OHRC specifically mentions areas like employment, housing, etc. - the types of \"services\" I've been talking about. You can live your life however you like.\n\nI, a liberal, and strong advocate of free speech, do not feel alarmed by the free speech laws in Canada. I am far more worried about how our *culture* at large views and values free speech, but this is a separate question altogether, and a big issue for both right and left.\n\n(I know the right mocks the left for being \"snowflakes\", but I've never seen snowflakier than on \/r\/conservative and whatnot. I think I mentioned this in my original post. The problem is ubiquitous.)","created_utc":1535720256,"score":2,"subreddit":"Liberal"}
